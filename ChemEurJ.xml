         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Diradical&#8208;Mediated ipso&#8208;Cyclization towards Double Dearomative [2+2]&#8208;Cycloaddition or Smiles&#8208;Type Rearrangement</title>

         <dc:description>
Diradical&#8208;mediated ipso&#8208;cyclization involving dearomatizing spiro&#8208;intermediates of aromatic compounds towards divergent reaction pathways deserves investigation but has been rarely reported so far. By tuning the rate of C&#8722;S bond cleavage in the key dearomatizing spiro intermediate, a chemical divergent reaction of (hetero)aryl sulfonamides has been achieved in a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced energy transfer reaction pathway involving diradical species.







Abstract
When mono&#8208;radical ipso&#8208;cyclization of aryl sulfonamides tend to undergo Smiles&#8208;type rearrangement through aromatization&#8208;driven C&#8722;S bond cleavage, diradical&#8208;mediated cyclization must perform in a distinct reaction pathway. It is interesting meanwhile challenging to tune the rate of C&#8722;S bond cleavage to achieve a chemically divergent reaction of (hetero) aryl sulfonamides in a visible&#8208;light induced energy transfer (EnT) reaction pathway involving diradical species. Herein a chemically divergent reaction based on the designed indole&#8208;tethered (hetero)arylsulfonamides is reported which involves a diradical&#8208;mediated ipso&#8208;cyclization and a controllable cleavage of an inherent C&#8722;S bond. The combined experimental and computational results have revealed that the cleavage of the C&#8722;S bond in these substrates can be controlled by tuning the heteroaryl moieties: a) If the (hetero)aryl is thienyl, furyl, phenanthryl, etc., the radical coupling of double dearomative diradicals (DDDR) precedes over C&#8722;S bond cleavage to afford cyclobutene fused indolines by double dearomative [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition; b) if the (hetero)aryl is phenyl, naphthyl, pyridyl, indolyl etc., the cleavage of C&#8722;S bond in DDDR is favored over radical coupling to afford biaryl products.

         <title>A Selective Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular&#8208;Proton&#8208;Transfer (ESIPT) Sensor for Copper(II) Based on Chelation&#8208;Enhanced Quenching and &#8220;Off&#8208;On&#8221; Detection of Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis of 2&#8208;(4,5&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenol (TPI&#8208;9) as an interesting fluorescent molecule displaying Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular&#8208;Proton&#8208;Transfer (ESIPT) with Stokes shift of 120 nm. Phenolic compounds with the ability to form intramolecular hydrogen bonds and subsequent proton transfer are known as ESIPT fluorophores. Proton accepting ability can increase significantly by tailoring electron&#8208;donating groups. With the assistance of an environment&#8208;friendly organocatalyst, 10&#8208;camphor sulfonic acid (10&#8208;CSA), TPI&#8208;9 was synthesized to introduce substituents with electron&#8208;donating abilities to develop an efficient ESIPT mechanism. Factors influencing the emission, such as solvent, pH, and metal ions, are investigated. Quenching of fluorescence by Cu2+ through chelation enhancement quenching effect with a high selectivity allowed the establishment of a Cu2+ sensor with an LoD of 0.57 ppm and a ratiometric estimation with an LoD of 0.73 ppm. Metal binding (2:1) stoichiometry and quenching constant (0.0072 mol&#8208;1s&#8208;1) are calculated from Job&#8217;s and Stern&#8208;Volmer plots. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are in accordance with the experimental results. Competitive replacement of TPI&#8208;9 by amino acids restores ESIPT, consequently, the fluorescence. Thus, an &#8220;off&#8208;on&#8221; fluorescence sensor for amino acid estimation is developed under 1&#8208;minute incubation. A linear relationship between amino acid concentration and fluorescence intensity is in 0&#8208;20 &#956;g/mL range, and the LoD is less than 2.2 &#956;g/mL</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based polymer electrolytes with good flexibility and viscoelasticity, low interfacial resistance, and fabricating cost have caught worldwide attention, but their practical application is still hampered by the instability at high voltages and the ionic conductivity (10&#8722;8 to 10&#8722;6 S cm&#8722;1). Herein, we rational designed defects&#8208;abundant Ga2O3&#160;nanobricks as multifunctional filler constructed a PEO&#8208;based organic&#8208;inorganic electrolyte for lithium metal batteries. Due to the abundant O&#8208;defects&#160;feature of Ga2O3&#160;filler, this PEO&#8208;based composite&#160;electrolyte not only broadens electrochemical stability window&#160;(over 5.3&#160;V versus Li/Li+)&#160;but also in&#8208;situ forms a Li&#8211;Ga alloy and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film during the cycling process causing a rapid diffusion of Li+&#160;ions. The as&#8208;prepared electrolyte achieves the effect of stabilizing interfacial with Li metal (without short&#8208;circuiting over 500 h at 0.2 mA cm&#8722;2) and possesses superior high ionic conductivity. The assembled all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LiFePO4//Li cells attained a superior cycling performance of 146 mAh g&#8722;1 over 100 cycles at 0.5 C.&#160;The XPS analysis reveals that Ga2O3&#160;nanobricks can form a Li&#8208;Ga alloy layer in situ at the polymer/anode interface.&#160;This work shed a light on designing high ionic conductivity lithium alloys in the composite electrolyte to improve the electrochemical properties of PEO&#8208;based polymer electrolytes.</dc:description>

Due to the abundant O-defects&#160;feature of Ga2O3&#160;filler, this PEO-based composite&#160;electrolyte not only broadens electrochemical stability window&#160;(over 5.3&#160;V versus Li/Li+)&#160;but also in-situ forms a Li&#8211;Ga alloy and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film during the cycling process causing a rapid diffusion of Li+&#160;ions. The as-prepared electrolyte achieves the effect of stabilizing interfacial with Li metal (without short-circuiting over 500 h at 0.2 mA cm&#8722;2) and possesses superior high ionic conductivity. The assembled all-solid-state LiFePO4//Li cells attained a superior cycling performance of 146 mAh g&#8722;1 over 100 cycles at 0.5 C.&#160;The XPS analysis reveals that Ga2O3&#160;nanobricks can form a Li-Ga alloy layer in situ at the polymer/anode interface.&#160;This work shed a light on designing high ionic conductivity lithium alloys in the composite electrolyte to improve the electrochemical properties of PEO-based polymer electrolytes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Orbital Nature of Carboionic Monoradicals Made from Diradicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electronic, optical, and solid state properties of a series of monoradicals, anions and cations, obtained from starting neutral diradicals, have been studied. Diradicals based on s&#8208;indacene and indenoacenes, with benzothiophenes fused and in different orientations feature a varying degree of diradical character in the neutral state which is here related with the properties of the radical redox forms. The analysis of their optical features in the polymethine monoradicals has been carried out in the framework of the molecular orbital and valence bond theories. Electronic UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR absorption, x&#8208;ray solid state diffraction and quantum chemical calculations have been carried out. Studies of the different positive/negative charged species, both residing in the same skeletal p&#8208;conjugated backbone, are rare for organic molecules. The key factor for the dual stabilization is the presence in the starting diradical character that enables to indistinctively accommodate a pseudo&#8208;hole and a pseudo&#8208;electron defect with certainly small reorganization energies for ambipolar charge transport.</dc:description>

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Exploration of ESIPT in a Systematically Constructed Series of Benzimidazole Based Schiff Base Probes: Application as Chemosensors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we have utilized 2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)benzimidazole (HBI) to synthesize 3&#8208;(1H&#8208;benzoimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;5&#8208;methyl&#8208;benzaldehyde (HBIA) followed by three Schiff bases by using &#8208;ortho (H2BIo), &#8208;meta (H3BIdm) and &#8208;para (H2BIp) substituted amino benzoic acids and studied their photophysical properties. We have successfully derived molecular structures of HBI, HBIA and H3BIdm which reveals that in HBI and HBIA, the phenolic &#8208;OH is intramolecularly hydrogen bonded with sp2N of benzimidazole group whereas in H3BIdm, it is hydrogen bonded with imine C=N of Schiff base moiety, which is responsible for different solid state emission properties of the reported compounds. Extensive experimental and theoretical studies show that for all three Schiff bases, in solution due to activation of C=N isomerization, ESIPT operates through benzimidazole site and displays different emission from the solid state. Furthermore, H2BIo, H3BIdm and H2BIp selectively sense Cu2+ in semi aqueous medium with nano&#8208;molar detection limit and in HuH&#8208;7 cells through the inhibition of ESIPT of process.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioinspired Design of an Uncharged Ambipolar Helical Scaffold to Achieve Efficient Solid&#8208;State Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work demonstrates highly efficient solid&#8208;state proton conduction in helical organic scaffolds inspired by the biomolecule Gramicidin A. The scaffold 1 derived from pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxamide (PDC) residue adopts a helical conformation that is stabilized by a network of strong bifurcated intramolecular H&#8208;bonds between the polar residues that align the inner (concave) face of the molecule, while the aromatic units present in 1 are oriented outwardly. As a result, the helix attains an ambipolar nature just like Gramicidin A. Two different solid forms of 1 could be isolated: a yellow solid from high&#8208;polarity solvents and an orange solid from low&#8208;polarity solvents. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) studies showed that in the former, molecules of 1 are stacked in a homochiral fashion while in the latter heterochiral stacks of 1 were present. The yellow form exhibited almost &#8764;300&#8208;fold higher conductivity (of up to 0.12 mS/cm at 95 &#176;C and 95% relative humidity) than the orange form as a result of closer intermolecular proximity and lower activation energy of 0.098 eV indicating Grotthus mechanism of proton transport. This study establishes the key role of bioinspired design and controlled stereo&#8208;organization of such discrete uncharged organic molecules for achieving efficient solid state proton conduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and densification of Mo/Mg co&#8208;doped apatite&#8208;type lanthanum silicate electrolyte&#160;with enhanced ionic conductivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Apatite&#8208;type lanthanum silicate (LSO) electrolyte is one of the most promising candidates for developing intermediate&#8208;temperature&#160;solid oxide electrolysis cells&#160;and solid oxide full cells (IT&#8208;SOECs and SOFCs) due to its stability and low&#160;activation energy. However, the LSO electrolyte still suffers from unsatisfied ionic conductivity and low relative density. Here in this work, a novel co&#8208;doping method is reported to prepare highly purified nanocrystalline powder of Mg&#8208;Mo co&#8208;doped LSO (Mg/Mo&#8208;LSO) electrolytes with high excellent densification properties and improved ionic conductivity. Introducing the Mo6+&#160;and Mg2+&#160;ions into the LSO structure can increase the number of interstitial oxide ions and improve the degree of densification at lower sintering temperatures, more importantly, expand the migration channel of oxide ions to enhance the ionic conductivity. As a result, the relative density of the fabricated Mo/Mg&#8208;LSO electrolytes pellets could achieve more than 98% of the theoretical density after sintering at 1500 &#8451; for 4 h with a grain size of about 1&#8208;3 &#956;m and the EIS results showed the ionic conductivity increased from 0.782 mS&#183;cm&#8208;1&#160;for the pristine LSO to 33.94 mS&#183;cm&#8208;1&#160;for the doped sample La9.5Si5.45Mg0.3Mo0.25O26+&#948;&#160;at 800 &#8451;. In addition, the effect of different Mo6+&#160;doping contents was investigated systematically. The proposed Mo/Mg co&#8208;doping method&#160;is one step forward in developing apatite&#8208;structured electrolytes&#160;addressing the common issues associated with the fabrication of dense, highly conductive, and thermochemically stable solid electrolytes.</dc:description>

Abstract
1,3,5&#8208;tri&#8208;substituted benzene rings emerged with unique properties has widespread applications in materials, boosting the rapid development of their synthesis. Despite the significance, the direct construction of hetero&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;trisubstituted benzene core was far less&#8208;developed. Herein, we realized a DBU&#8208;mediated isomerization/6&#8208;&#960; electro&#8208;cyclization/oxidative aromatization cascade of sulfonyl&#8208;substituted allenyl ketones under an air atmosphere (DBU=1,8&#8208;diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;ene). This versatile protocol featured metal&#8208;free conditions, easy operation, and broad functional group tolerance provides a new avenue for the construction of hetero&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tri&#8208;substituted benzene.

         <title>Liquid Dynamics Determine Transition Metal&#8208;N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Complex Formation</title>

Getting beyond first base: To choose the best base in NHC complex syntheses, considerations beyond pKa values are necessary. The high activity of ionic bases can be explained through their affinity to form ion pairs with the substrate imidazolium cation, allowing for a more frequent interaction with the acidic site of the ring.







Abstract
The mechanism of metal&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complex formation from imidazolium salts in the presence of weak bases was investigated through theoretical methods. Quantum chemical calculations revealed that the two bases considered here, sodium acetate and trimethylamine, both facilitate complex formation. In contrast to previous experiments, these calculations indicated a slightly lower barrier with the amine. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that the ionic nature of the [AuCl2]&#8722; and imidazolium ions, as well as the sodium acetate base keep these species associated in the reaction mixture through ion pairing. This pre&#8208;association of the components produces those clusters that are essential for the metal complex formation reaction. The neutral amine, however, remains mostly separated from the other reaction partners, making it a significantly less effective base.

         <title>Specific Signal Enhancement on an RNA&#8208;Protein Interface by Dynamic Nuclear Polarization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A guide to better spectra: Dynamic nuclear polarization, sparse isotope labeling, and methyl dynamics have been combined to yield site&#8208;specific enhancement of NMR spectroscopic signals from the protein&#8208;RNA binding site within a ribonucleoprotein. For L7Ae protein in complex with guide RNA from box C/D complex, a single methyl&#8208;nucleotide contact can be spectroscopically isolated.







Abstract
Sensitivity and specificity are both crucial for the efficient solid&#8208;state NMR structure determination of large biomolecules. We present an approach that features both advantages by site&#8208;specific enhancement of NMR spectroscopic signals from the protein&#8208;RNA binding site within a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) by dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). This approach uses modern biochemical techniques for sparse isotope labeling and exploits the molecular dynamics of 13C&#8208;labeled methyl groups exclusively present in the protein. These dynamics drive heteronuclear cross relaxation and thus allow specific hyperpolarization transfer across the biomolecular complex's interface. For the example of the L7Ae protein in complex with a 26mer guide RNA minimal construct from the box C/D complex in archaea, we demonstrate that a single methyl&#8208;nucleotide contact is responsible for most of the polarization transfer to the RNA, and that this specific transfer can be used to boost both NMR spectral sensitivity and specificity by DNP.

         <title>Tetrelanes versus Tetrylenes as Precursors to Transition Metal Complexes Featuring Tridentate PEP Tetryl Ligands (E=Si, Ge, Sn)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PEP ligands: Two general synthetic approaches to the synthesis of tridentate PEP tetryl (E=Si, Ge, Sn) metal complexes are presented as a function of the metal&#8208;free precursor, tetrelane or tetrylene, that gives rise to the final PEP tetryl ligand. For each approach, all the currently known types of PEP tetryl ligand frameworks that have been found in their corresponding complexes are presented and discussed.







Abstract
Two synthetic approaches have until now been used to synthesize transition metal complexes having a tridentate (pincer or tripod) PEP tetryl (E=Si, Ge, Sn) ligand. These approaches differ in the metal&#8208;free precursor, tetrelane or tetrylene, that gives rise to the corresponding PEP tetryl ligand. Tetrelanes (PSiP silanes, PGeP germanes and PSnP stannanes and simple phosphane&#8208;free stannanes) have led to tetryl ligands by oxidatively adding an E&#8722;X bond (X=H, C or halogen in most cases) to the metal atom of a low&#8208;valent transition metal complex, whereas tetrylenes (PGeP germylenes and PSnP stannylenes) have led to tetryl ligands upon insertion of their E atom into an M&#8722;X bond (X=Cl in most cases) of the metal precursor or through a derivatization of the E atom after the tetrylene fragment is coordinated to the metal. For each synthetic approach, all the currently known types of PEP tetryl ligand frameworks that have been found in transition metal complexes are presented and discussed in this review.

         <title>Chalcogen&#8208;Bond Catalysis: Telluronium&#8208;Catalyzed [4+2]&#8208;Cyclocondensation of (in situ Generated) Aryl Imines with Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Telluronium salts bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups were prepared, and their ability to drive chalcogen bonds with ketones and imines was demonstrated in the solid state and in solution. These strong &#963;&#8208;hole bond donors were able to efficiently catalyze the Povarov reaction through chalcogen bond activation of imines and subsequent reaction with alkenes. The title reaction was found to be as efficient with pre&#8208;formed or in situ generated imines.







Abstract
In the chalcogen series, tellurium species exhibit the strongest chalcogen bonding (ChB) interaction with electron&#8208;rich atom. This property explains the renewed interested toward tellurium&#8208;based derivatives and their use in different applications, such as organocatalysis. In this context, the catalytic activity of telluronium salts in the Povarov reaction is presented herein. Different dienophiles, as well as imines of variable electronic nature, efficiently react in the presence of catalytic amount of either diarylmethyltelluronium or triaryltelluronium salts. Both catalysts could also readily perform the three&#8208;component Povarov reaction starting from aldehyde, aniline and dihydrofuran. The reactivity of telluroniums towards imines and aldehydes was confirmed in the solid state by the ability of Te atom to interact through ChB with the oxygen carbonyl of acetone, and in solution with significant shift variations of the imine proton and of the tellurium atom in 1H and 125Te NMR spectroscopy. For the most active telluronium catalysts bearing CF3 groups, association constants (K) with N&#8208;phenyl phenylmethanimine in the range 22&#8211;38&#8197;M&#8722;1 were measured in dichloromethane.

This review summarizes the essential proteases involved in blood coagulation and fibrinolysis, the endogenous peptide sequences they recognize and hydrolyze, and synthetic activity&#8208;based peptide probes based on these sequences to measure their activity. The existing strategies summarized in this review could contribute to the challenges ahead in the field of coagulation and fibrinolytic monitoring, especially for point&#8208;of&#8208;care applications.







Abstract
The blood coagulation cascade is a complex physiological process involving the action of multiple coupled enzymes, cofactors, and substrates, ultimately leading to clot formation. Serine proteases have a crucial role, and aberrations in their activity can lead to life&#8208;threatening bleeding disorders and thrombosis. This review summarizes the essential proteases involved in blood coagulation and fibrinolysis, the endogenous peptide sequences they recognize and hydrolyze, and synthetic peptide probes based on these sequences to measure their activity. The information in this review can contribute to developing novel anticoagulant therapies and specific substrates for point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnosis of coagulation pathologies.

         <title>Substituent&#8208;Dependent Photoexcitation Processes of &#960;&#8208;Stacked Ion Pairs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various combinations of porphyrin ions with controlled electronic states were achieved by ion&#8208;pair metathesis based on the hard and soft acids and bases (HSAB) theory. The transient absorption spectra of the porphyrin ion pairs revealed photoinduced electron transfer from the anion to the cation through substituent&#8208;dependent photoexcitation processes.







Abstract
Porphyrin ion pairs, the charge of which is delocalized in core units, form tightly associated structures through i&#960;&#8211;i&#960; interactions. 5,10,15&#8208;Triphenyl&#8208;substituted porphyrin&#8211;AuIII complex, which is favorable for forming stacked structures in the form of a stable ion, has been synthesized. Ion&#8208;pair metathesis based on the hard and soft acids and bases theory enabled combination with porphyrin anions possessing electronic states controlled by electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. Transient absorption spectroscopy suggested that the lifetimes of the radical pairs generated by photoinduced electron transfer of the ion pairs could be controlled by a judicious combination of the anions and cations.

         <title>Fully Tin&#8208;Coated Coinage Metal Ions: A Pincer&#8208;Type Bis&#8208;stannylene Ligand for Exclusive Tetrahedral Complexation</title>

Tin shines better with gold or silver: A luminescent pincer&#8208;type bis&#8208;stannylene ligand for exclusive tetrahedral coordination of the coinage metals was designed, and photoluminescence investigations as well as extensive quantum chemical calculations were carried out.







Abstract
The synthesis of a novel bis&#8208;stannylene pincer ligand and its complexation with coinage metals (CuI, AgI and AuI) are described. All coinage metal centres are in tetrahedral coordination environments in the solid state and are exclusively coordinated by four neutral SnII donors. 119Sn NMR provided information about the behaviour in solution. All of the isolated compounds have photoluminescent properties, and these were investigated at low and elevated temperatures. Compared to the free bis&#8208;stannylene ligand, coordination to coinage metals led to an increase in the luminescence intensity. The new compounds were investigated in detail through all&#8208;electron relativistic density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>A Conformal Carbon Nanolayer Coated Fe2O3 Cocatalyst for the Promoted Activity of Plasma&#8208;Sputtered BiVO4 Photoanode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Team work: Simultaneous improvement of activity and stability on BiVO4 photoanode was achieved by the simple H2 plasma treatment and a C&#8722;Fe2O3 oxygen evolution catalyst loading.







Abstract
To simultaneously improve the hole extraction ability of the BiVO4 photoanode and accelerate the surface reaction kinetics, herein, a carbon nanolayer conformally coated Fe2O3 (C&#8722;Fe2O3) as oxygen evolution catalyst (OEC) is loaded on the H2 plasma treated nanoporous BiVO4 (BVO(H2)) surface by a hydrothermal reaction. It is found that the H2 plasma induced vacancies in BVO remarkably increases the conductivity, and the C&#8722;Fe2O3 enables hole extraction from the bulk to the surface as well as efficient hole injection to the electrolyte. As a result, the C&#8722;Fe2O3/BVO(H2) photoanode achieves a photocurrent density of 4.4&#8197;mA/cm2 at 1.23&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and an ABPE value of 1.5&#8201;% at 0.68&#8197;V vs. RHE, which are 4.8&#8208;fold and 13&#8208;fold higher than that of BVO photoanode, respectively.

         <title>Photocatalytic Synthesis of Acetals and Ketals from Aldehydes and Silylenolethers without the Use of Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoredox catalytic cycle with an electron&#8208;deficient perylene bisimide (PBI) runs as long as green light is provided. The substrate silylenolethers and aldehydes enter the cycle, are oxidized to their radical cations and converted to acetals and ketals, which leave the cycle as products. Acid catalysts are not needed. Ketal and acetal groups protect the carbonyl compounds like helmets. More information can be found in the Research Article by H.&#8208;A. Wagenknecht and D. Steuernagel (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203767).

         <title>Cyclic or linear? Parameters determining the outcome of glycine polymerization in silica surface prebiotic scenarios</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The parameters that determine the formation of linear peptides and cyclic dimers (diketopiperazine, DKP) on silica surfaces of different surface area, silanol and siloxane ring populations, controlled by thermal treatments, are investigated upon glycine deposition from gas and liquid phases. The formed products were characterized by infrared and Raman spectroscopies, X&#8208;ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis. The results reveal the importance of &#8220;nearly&#8208;free&#8221; silanols to form ester centers as primers for the formation of linear peptides over DKP, on surfaces with medium silanol density (1.4 to 2.7 nm&#8208;2). Quenched reactivity is seen on isolated silanols (density &#8804; 0.7 nm&#8208;2), while silanols involved in hydrogen bonding (density of 4.5 nm&#8208;2) weakly interact with Gly resulting in its cyclization to DKP. Deposition of glycine from liquid phase may also form both DKP and linear polymers, depending on its loading and silica surface. These conclusions demonstrate the complexity of glycine surface chemistry in the polymerization reaction and highlight the interest of a surface science approach to evaluate geochemical prebiotic scenarios.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Aurone&#8208;Based Dual&#8208;State Emissive (DSE) Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of dual&#8208;state emissive (DSE) fluorophores, i.e. organic molecules showing balanced emission in both solution and as molecular solids, has recently become an emerging approach in material science, biology, sensing, and optoelectronics. However, the majority of existing DSE fluorophores represents structural modifications of the scaffolds known for their aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties, e.g. tetraphenylethylenes (TFE), triphenylamines (TFA), and others. In this study, we introduce aurones as an easily accessible scaffold for the construction of DSE fluorophores and describe the main design principles allowing to achieve the balanced emission in both solution and solid state. Herein, we present the solid&#8208;state fluorescence in a systematic series of aurone derivatives for the first time. We propose that the newly found DSE properties of aurones in combination with their established biological activity can be applied efficiently in biomedical studies and diagnostic tools.</dc:description>

         <title>Origin of Stereoselectivity in SE2&#8242; Reactions of Six&#8208;membered Ring Oxocarbenium Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bottoms up! Quantum chemical analyses of the transition states of SE2&#8242; reactions between substituted six&#8208;membered oxocarbenium ions and allyltrimethylsilane have provided quantitative insight into the stereoelectronic effects of the ring substituents, which dictate the stereoselectivity of the additions.







Abstract
Oxocarbenium ions are key reactive intermediates in organic chemistry. To generate a series of structure&#8208;reactivity&#8208;stereoselectivity principles for these species, we herein investigated the bimolecular electrophilic substitution reactions (SE2&#8242;) between allyltrimethylsilane and a series of archetypal six&#8208;membered ring oxocarbenium ions using a combined density functional theory (DFT) and coupled&#8208;cluster theory approach. These reactions preferentially proceed following a reaction path where the oxocarbenium ion transforms from a half chair (3H4 or 4H3) to a chair conformation. The introduction of alkoxy substituents on six&#8208;membered ring oxocarbenium ions, dramatically influences the conformational preference of the canonical 3H4 and 4H3 conformers, and thereby the stereochemical outcome of the SE2&#8242; reaction. In general, we find that the stereoselectivity in the reactions correlates to the &#8220;intrinsic preference&#8221; of the cations, as dictated by their shape. However, for the C5&#8208;CH2OMe substituent, steric factors override the &#8220;intrinsic preference&#8221;, showing a more selective reaction than expected based on the shape of the ion. Our SE2&#8242; energetics correlate well with experimentally observed stereoselectivity, and the use of the activation strain model has enabled us to quantify important interactions and structural features that occur in the transition state of the reactions to precisely understand the relative energy barriers of the diastereotopic addition reactions. The fundamental mechanistic insight provided in this study will aid in understanding the reactivity of more complex glycosyl cations featuring multiple substituents and will facilitate our general understanding of glycosylation reactions.

         <title>Engineering Sandwiched Nanochannel Aptasensor for Efficiently Screening Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aptamer sandwiched nanochannel electrochemical sensor was constructed for the highly selective determination of cancer cells. The structure design of nanochannel composite aptasensor not only presents an efficacious and reliable approach for cancer cell detection but also provides advantage for preventing electrode passivation in the process of biomarkers analysis.







Abstract
Cancer cells are a class of important tumor biomarkers and are closely related to tumorous progression. It is urgent to develop a sensitive and highly efficient method for the rapid and accurate detection of cancer cells. Herein, an aptamer sandwiched nanochannel electrochemical sensor was established for the highly selective determination of cancer cells. By virtue of the porous nanochannels as the filter platform and immobilized with DNA aptamers for specifically capturing the cancer cells, the nanochannel&#8208;based electrochemical sensor denotes excellent performance for MCF&#8208;7 screening, and allowing a low limit of detection of 36&#8197;cells&#8201;mL&#8722;1. The nanochannels&#8208;based sandwich structure aptasensor not only presents an efficacious and reliable approach for cancer cell detection but also provides great advantage for preventing electrode passivation in the process of biomarkers analysis.

         <title>Funneled Depolymerization of Ionic Liquid&#8208;Based Biorefinery &#8220;Heterogeneous&#8221; Lignin into Guaiacols over Reusable Palladium Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficient utilization of lignin, the direct source of renewable aromatics, into value&#8208;added renewable chemicals is an important step towards sustainable biorefinery practices. Nevertheless, owing to the random heterogeneous structure and limited solubility, lignin utilization has been primarily limited to burning for energy. The catalytic depolymerization of lignin has been proposed and demonstrated as a viable route to sustainable biorefinery, however, low yields and poor selectivity of products, high char formation, and limited to no recycling of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalyst involved in lignin depolymerization demands attention to enable practical&#8208;scale lignocellulosic biorefineries. In this study, we demonstrate the catalytic depolymerization of ionic liquid&#8208;based biorefinery poplar lignin into guaiacols over a reusable zirconium phosphate supported palladium catalyst. The essence of the study lies in the high conversion (&gt;80%), minimum char formation (7&#8208;16%), high yields of guaiacols (up to 200 mg / g of lignin), and catalyst reusability. Both solid residue, liquid stream, and gaseous products were thoroughly characterized using ICP&#8208;OES, PXRD, CHN analysis, GC&#8208;MS, GPC, and 2D NMR to understand the hydrogenolysis pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Orientational Control of Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Pyrene Clusters using a DNA Scaffold.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein investigated chiroptical activities of pyrene clusters incorporated within a DNA duplex. Three pyrene derivatives were prepared on D&#8208;threoninol linkers to allow incorporation within a DNA strand. DNA scaffolds were prepared containing dimers, tetramers, and hexamers of the pyrene derivatives. The homo dimers of 1&#8208;pyrenecarboxylic acid and of 4&#8208;pyrenecarboxylic acid, but not 2&#8208;pyrenecarboxylic acid, emitted intense circularly polarized luminescence signals. Although increasing the number of pyrene units weakened the signal, insertion of natural base pairs between two dimers enhanced its intensity. Interestingly, circularly polarized luminescence intensities varied non&#8208;monotonically depending on the number of intervening base pairs, indicating the importance of orientation between pyrene dimers. The results presented here will lead to development bright circularly polarized luminescence materials and probes.</dc:description>

         <title>The Facile Synthesis of TPE&#8208;Based Fluorophores Derived by &#960;&#8208;Extended Systems: Opposite Mechanofluorochromism, Anti&#8208;counterfeiting and Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although remarkable progresses are achieved in the design and development of the mono&#8208;shift in photoluminescence for mechanofluorochromic materials, it is still a severe challenge to explore the opposite mechanofluorochromic materials with both blue&#8208; and red&#8208;shifted photoluminescence. Herein, two unprecedented 4,5&#8208;bis(TPE)&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole fused pyridine or quinoline&#8208;based fluorophores X&#8208;1 and X&#8208;2 were designed and synthesized, and X&#8208;1 and X&#8208;2, exhibit completely opposite mechanofluorochromic behaviour. Under UV lamp, the color of pristine X&#8208;1 changed from blue to green with reversible red&#8208;shifted 27 nm in fluorescence emission spectra after ground, while the color of pristine X&#8208;2 changed from red to yellow with reversible blue&#8208;shifted 74 nm after ground. The detailed characterizations (including PXRD, SEM and DSC) confirmed that this opposite mechanofluorochromism was attributed to the transformation of order&#8208;crystalline and amorphous states. The crystal structure analysis and theoretical calculation further explain that opposite mechanofluorochromic behavior take into account different &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking mode by inducd &#960;&#8208;extended systems. In addition, these TPE&#8208;based Fluorophores (X&#8208;1 and X&#8208;2) exhibited excellent bio&#8208;compatibility and fluorescence properties for bio&#8208;imaging, writable data storage and anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials.</dc:description>

The crystal structure analysis and theoretical calculation further explain that opposite mechanofluorochromic behavior take into account different &#960;-&#960; stacking mode by inducd &#960;-extended systems. In addition, these TPE-based Fluorophores (X-1 and X-2) exhibited excellent bio-compatibility and fluorescence properties for bio-imaging, writable data storage and anti-counterfeiting materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Effective SrWO4/TiO2 heterojunction with enhanced carriers separation and transfer for photocatalytic methane oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic methane oxidation to oxygenates with promising performance remains as a grand challenge due to the low productivity and severe overoxidation. Herein, SrWO4/TiO2 heterojunction was developed for photocatalytic methane oxidation with O2 to liquid oxygenates products at mild reaction conditions. The optimized SrWO4/TiO2 catalyst exhibited high productivity of 13365&#160;&#956;mol/g with high selectivity of 98.7% for oxygenates. Benefited from the intimate heterojunction interface of SrWO4/TiO2, the constructed &#8544;&#8208;type heterostructure improved the separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers, and a high&#8208;speed transfer channel for photogenerated carriers was fabricated. Simultaneously, the special band structure can increase the amount of photogenerated electrons and holes on TiO2 surface, which promoted the formation of reactive oxygen species to enhance liquid oxygenates productivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantiodivergent Sulfoxidation Catalyzed by a Photoswitchable Iron Salen Phosphate Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we describe a photoswitchable iron(III) salen phosphate catalyst, which is able to catalyze the enantiodivergent oxidation of prochiral aryl alkyl sulfides to chiral aryl alkyl sulfoxides. The stable (S)&#8208;axial isomer of the catalyst produced enantioenriched sulfoxides with the (R)&#8208;configuration in up to 75% e.e., whereas the photoisomerized metastable (R)&#8208;axial isomer of the catalyst favored the formation of (S)&#8208;sulfoxides in up to 43% e.e. The maximum &#916;e.e. value obtained in the enantiodivergent sulfoxidation was 118%, which is identical to the maximum &#916;e.e. value that was measured in the enantiodivergent epoxidation of alkenes by a related recently described Mn1 catalyst. This iron&#8208;based catalyst broadens the scope of photoswitchable enantiodivergent catalysts and may use in the future to develop a photoswitchable catalytic system that can write digital information on a polymer chain in the form chiral sulfoxide functions.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stable metal&#8208;free diradicaloids are fascinating compounds, typically based on covalent polycyclic or nitrogen&#8208;containing &#960;&#8208;conjugated frameworks. Unfortunately, their preparation and the modulation of their diradical character require substantial synthetic efforts. The present work introduces a synthetic approach to diradicaloids by the ease and modularity of Lewis pair formation. Binding redox&#8208;active bis(catecholato)silane Lewis acids to ditopic tetraoxolene Lewis bases yields adducts with varying spin ground states. Computational analyses disclose that the diradical character increases with the electron donor ability of the catechols and the electron accepting ability of the tetraoxolene. Hence, this protocol grants access to diradicaloids with rationally adjustable diradical character of high potential for numerous applications in a single step.</dc:description>

         <title>Heteroaryl&#8208;Substituted Bis&#8208;Anils: Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE) Derivatives with Tunable ESIPT Emission Color and pH Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of heteroaryl&#8208;substituted bis&#8208;anil derivatives is described which present aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) coupled with an excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) process.







Abstract
The two&#8208;step synthesis, structural, and photophysical properties of a series of heteroaryl&#8208;substituted bis&#8208;anil derivatives presenting aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) coupled with an excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) process is described. The fluorescence color of the aggregates can be fine tuned by changing the electronic nature of the peripheral substitution, leading to a wide range of emission wavelengths (from green to the near infra&#8208;red). Moreover, upon introduction of strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups such as cyano (CN), a competition between ESIPT and deprotonation is observed leading to the emission of the anionic species at low water percentage. This observation led to the synthesis of an additional mixed AIE fluorophore, functionalized by methoxy groups on one side and cyano groups on the other side. Upon addition of water, this dye displays first anionic emission, followed by typical AIE/ESIPT red fluorescence upon formation of the aggregates. TD&#8208;DFT calculations on selected AIE dyes were performed to rationalize the nature of the emissive transitions in these derivatives.

Ring contraction: m&#8208;Benziporphyrin(1.1.0.0) and m&#8208;pyreniporphyrin(1.1.0.0) were synthesized as ring&#8208;contracted carbaporphyrins with Pd coordination ability. PdII complexes of these carbaporphyrins exhibit red&#8208;shifted absorption bands and small HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps despite their small &#960;&#8208;electronic networks, probably due to the extremely short Pd&#8722;C bonds.







Abstract
m&#8208;Benziporphyrin(1.1.0.0) and m&#8208;pyreniporphyrin(1.1.0.0) were prepared as ring&#8208;contracted carbaporphyrins. While m&#8208;Benziporphyrin(1.1.0.0) was unstable, m&#8208;pyreniporphyrin(1.1.0.0) was fairly stable. Both of their PdII complexes showed distorted coordination structures with extremely short Pd&#8722;C bonds. As compared with the reported m&#8208;benziporphyrin PdII complexes, these PdII complexes showed considerably small HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps, despite their smaller molecular size. PdII metalation of the m&#8208;pyreniporphyrin(1.1.0.0) dimer gave the corresponding PdII complex, which showed similar distorted coordination and a smaller HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap. Finally, PdII metalation of a pyrene&#8208;sharing formal p&#8208;benziporphyrin(1.1.1.1) dimer gave a nonaromatic PdII dimer, which rearranged to an aromatic PdII complex upon treatment with alumina.

A hierarchically organized cocrystal of meso&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;sulfonato&#8208;phenyl)&#8208;porphyrin (TSPP4&#8722;) and N, N&#8242;&#8208;diethyl&#8208;viologen (DEV2+) is reported, wherein wave&#8208;like and saddle&#8208;like TSPP4&#8722; ions co&#8208;aggregate at a stoichiometric ratio of 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 to form unique J&#8208;type porphyrin arrays. The crystal incorporates six ionic conformations which lead to intricate supramolecular interactions.







Abstract
Ionic co&#8208;assembly of tetra&#8208;anionic porphyrins has been extensively researched in the construction of hierarchically organized architectures with potential application value in organic semiconductors, sunlight catalysts and supramolecular chirality systems. However, such architectures are difficult to grow to a size suitable for single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD); the lack of single&#8208;crystal structures of these architectures leads to challenges in gaining deeper comprehension about that. This study reports a hierarchically organized cocrystal of meso&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;sulfonato&#8208;phenyl)&#8208;porphyrin (TSPP4&#8722;) and N, N&#8242;&#8208;diethyl&#8208;viologen (DEV2+), wherein wave&#8208;like and saddle&#8208;like TSPP4&#8722; ions co&#8208;aggregate at a stoichiometric ratio of 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 to form unique porphyrin arrays; the spectrum characteristics and calculated coulombic exciton coupling energy show that these porphyrin arrays are J&#8208;aggregates. We prove that the distortion of porphyrin ring of TSPP4&#8722; strongly correlates with the deflection of its phenyl groups. The crystal comprises six different ionic conformations, and the multiplicity of ionic conformation leads to intricate supramolecular interactions.

         <title>An Efficient, Site&#8208;Selective and Spontaneous Peptide Macrocyclisation During in&#8197;vitro Translation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new cyclisation approach for peptides, derived from in&#8197;vitro translation, is developed that is highly selective for N&#8208;terminal cysteines. This approach allows other cysteine residues to be exploited for further peptide diversification. A model peptide showed a large impact from this cyclisation on binding and biological activity, and molecular dynamics was used to illustrate how this cyclisation change can influence peptide conformation.







Abstract
Macrocyclisation provides a means of stabilising the conformation of peptides, often resulting in improved stability, selectivity, affinity, and cell permeability. In this work, a new approach to peptide macrocyclisation is reported, using a cyanobenzothiazole&#8208;containing amino acid that can be incorporated into peptides by both in&#8197;vitro translation and solid phase peptide synthesis, meaning it should be applicable to peptide discovery by mRNA display. This cyclisation proceeds rapidly, with minimal by&#8208;products, is selective over other amino acids including non N&#8208;terminal cysteines, and is compatible with further peptide elaboration exploiting such an additional cysteine in bicyclisation and derivatisation reactions. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the new cyclisation group is likely to influence the peptide conformation as compared to previous thioether&#8208;based approaches, through rigidity and intramolecular aromatic interactions, illustrating their complementarity.

         <title>Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution by a De Novo Designed Metalloprotein that Undergoes Ni&#8208;Mediated Oligomerization Shift</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A de novo H2 evolving metallopeptide is constructed from first principles, which undergoes oligomerization change in the presence of NiII. Under white light, the metallopeptide produces H2 via a reductive quenching pathway. The timescales of ET and the role of thiol pKa is determined from TAS kinetics and pH titration experiments, respectively. Outer sphere steric modulation shows preferential binding of H+ to Ni from N&#8208;termini.







Abstract
De novo metalloprotein design involves the construction of proteins guided by specific repeat patterns of polar and apolar residues, which, upon self&#8208;assembly, provide a suitable environment to bind metals and produce artificial metalloenzymes. While a wide range of functionalities have been realized in de novo designed metalloproteins, the functional repertoire of such constructs towards alternative energy&#8208;relevant catalysis is currently limited. Here we show the application of de novo approach to design a functional H2 evolving protein. The design involved the assembly of an amphiphilic peptide featuring cysteines at tandem a/d sites of each helix. Intriguingly, upon NiII addition, the oligomers shift from a major trimeric assembly to a mix of dimers and trimers. The metalloprotein produced H2 photocatalytically with a bell&#8208;shape pH dependence, having a maximum activity at pH&#8197;5.5. Transient absorption spectroscopy is used to determine the timescales of electron transfer as a function of pH. Selective outer sphere mutations are made to probe how the local environment tunes activity. A preferential enhancement of activity is observed via steric modulation above the NiII site, towards the N&#8208;termini, compared to below the NiII site towards the C&#8208;termini.

         <title>Covalent Triazine Frameworks (CTFs): Synthesis, Crystallization, and Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent Triazine Frameworks have received great attention as an attractive photocatalyst owing to their unique structure characteristics. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the CTFs&#8217; synthetic methods, crystallization, and applications for photocatalytic water splitting. The perspectives and challenges of fabricating high crystalline CTFs and designing CTFs with excellent photocatalytic performance are also discussed.







Abstract
Covalent Triazine Frameworks (CTFs) have received great attention from academia owing to their unique structure characteristics such as nitrogen&#8208;rich structure, chemical stability, fully conjugated skeleton and high surface area; all these unique properties make CTFs attractive for widespread applications, especially for photocatalytic applications. In this review, we aim to provide recent advances in the CTFs preparation, and mainly focus on their photocatalytic applications. This review provides a comprehensive and systematic overview of the CTFs&#8217; synthetic methods, crystallinity lifting strategies, and their applications for photocatalytic water splitting. Firstly, a brief background including the photocatalytic water splitting and crystallinity are provided. Then, synthetic methods related to CTFs and the strategies for enhancing the crystallinity are summarized and compared. After that, the general photocatalytic mechanism and the strategies to improve the photocatalytic performance of CTFs are discussed. Finally, the perspectives and challenges of fabricating high crystalline CTFs and designing CTFs with excellent photocatalytic performance are discussed, inspiring the development of CTF materials in photocatalytic applications.

One pot, many products: A novel method is reported for the general synthesis of spiro&#8208;indenyl 1,4&#8208;benzoxazins and 2&#8208;(2,2&#8208;diarylvinyl)quinoxalines by FeIII&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular cyclization of propargylic alcohols. The hall&#8208;marks of the method are the use of low&#8208;cost substrates and an environmentally benign iron catalyst, high tolerance towards various functional groups, and switchable product formation.







Abstract
We report herein unprecedented cascade reactions of O&#8208;propargyl&#8208;N&#8208;tosyl&#8208;amino phenols with 10&#8197;mol% FeCl3 in DCE at room temperature for 0.67&#8211;3&#8197;h to form spiro&#8208;indenyl 1,4&#8208;benzoxazines with 38&#8211;89&#8201;% yield. Replacing the substrates&#8217; oxygen atom by a N&#8208;tosylimine group followed by treatment with the same catalyst and solvent at 80&#8201;&#176;C produced 2&#8208;(2,2&#8208;diarylvinyl)quinoxalines in 12&#8211;20&#8197;h with up to 62&#8201;% yield. Mechanistic understanding provided an insight into the transformations. The use of simple substrates and an environmentally benign low&#8208;cost catalyst, broad substrate scope and tolerance of diverse functional groups makes the methodology inherently attractive.

         <title>Dinitrogen Activation in the Gas Phase: Spectroscopic Characterization of C&#8722;N Coupling in the V3C++N2 Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of V3C+ with N2 is studied using IRPD spectroscopy. The cleavage of N&#8801;N bond and the subsequent C&#8722;N coupling is undoubtedly confirmed by the observed IR&#8208;active C=N stretching fundamental in the fingerprint region of the vibrational action spectrum. This work represents the first spectroscopic observation of the formed C&#8722;N bond directly from N2 in gas phase.







Abstract
We report on cluster&#8208;mediated C&#8722;N bond formation in the gas phase using N2 as a nitrogen source. The V3C++N2 reaction is studied by a combination of ion&#8208;trap mass spectrometry with infrared photodissociation (IRPD) spectroscopy and complemented by electronic structure calculations. The proposed reaction mechanism is spectroscopically validated by identifying the structures of the reactant and product ions. V3C+ exhibits a pyramidal structure of C1&#8208;symmetry. N2 activation is initiated by adsorption in an end&#8208;on fashion at a vanadium site, followed by spontaneous cleavage of the N&#8801;N triple bond and subsequent C&#8722;N coupling. The IRPD spectrum of the metal nitride product [NV3(C=N)]+ exhibits characteristic C=N double bond (1530&#8197;cm&#8722;1) and V&#8722;N single bond (770, 541 and 522&#8197;cm&#8722;1) stretching bands.

         <title>Oxychalcogenides: A Promising Class of Materials for Nonlinear Optical Crystals with Mixed&#8208;Anion Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The best of all worlds: Oxychalcogenides, promising IR NLO materials candidates, can integrate the property superiority of different anion groups, for example, the strong SHG response and wide IR transmission of metal chalcogenides and the large band gap and high laser damage threshold of oxides.







Abstract
Infrared nonlinear optical (IR NLO) materials are of great significance in the development of IR laser technology. But rationally designing high&#8208;performance IR NLO materials remains a huge challenge due to the conflict between the necessary properties required for NLO materials. Notably, oxychalcogenides with mixed&#8208;anion groups have drawn extensive interest as a family of important IR NLO candidates because they integrate the property advantages of oxides and chalcogenides by chemical substitution engineering. In this review, we provide a survey of reported oxychalcogenides and aim to present the development of NLO oxychalcogenides from the perspective of rational design of their structural chemistry. Furthermore, we focus on the relationships between partial substitution and structural symmetry as well as optical properties. These provide some helpful guidance for the further exploration and design of novel oxychalcogenide materials with excellent NLO performance in the future.

         <title>Molecular Insights into Bifunctional Ambruticin DH3 for Substrate Specificity and Catalytic Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The theoretical study uncovers both the structural rationale for substrate specificity of the first bifunctional dehydratase&#8208;cyclase AsmDH3 and a complete one&#8208;base catalytic mechanism including dehydration and cyclization.







Abstract
Dehydratase (DH), a domain located at polyketide synthase (PKS) modules, commonly catalyzes the dehydration of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy to an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acyl intermediate. As a unique bifunctional dehydratase, AmbDH3 (the DH domain of module 3 of the ambruticin PKS) is verified to be responsible for both dehydration and the following pyran&#8208;forming cyclization. Besides, in&#8197;vitro studies showed that its catalytic efficiency varies with different chiral substrates. However, the detailed molecular mechanism of AmbDH3 remains unclear. In this work, the structural rationale for the substrate specificity (2R/2S&#8208; and 6R/6S&#8208;substrates) in AmbDH3 was elucidated and the complete reaction pathways including dehydration and cyclization were presented. Both MD simulations and binding free energy calculations indicated AmbDH3 had a stronger preference for 2R&#8208;substrates (2R6R&#8208;2, 2R6S&#8208;3) than 2S&#8208;substrates (2S6R&#8208;1), and residue H51 and G61 around the catalytic pocket were emphasized by forming stable hydrogen bonds with 2R&#8208;substrates. In addition, AmbDH3&#8217;s mild tolerance at C6 was explained by comparison of substrate conformation and hydrogen bond network in 6S&#8208; and 6R&#8208;substrate systems. The QM/MM results supported a consecutive one&#8208;base dehydration and cyclization mechanism for 2R6S&#8208;3 substrate with the energy barrier of 25.2&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and 24.5&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, respectively. Our computational results uncover the substrate recognition and catalytic process of the first bifunctional dehydratase&#8208;cyclase AmbDH3, which will shed light on the application of multifunctional DH domains in PKSs for diverse natural product analogs and benefit the chemoenzymatic synthesis of stereoselective pyran&#8208;containing products.

         <title>Absolute Configuration Determination of Chiral API Molecules by MicroED Analysis of Cocrystal Powders Formed Based on Cocrystal Propensity Prediction Calculations
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new and robust pipeline for absolute configuration determination is presented here. First, virtual screening selects chiral probes compatible with the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). Second, crystallization trials produce microcrystals suitable for analysis without further optimization. Finally, MicroED is used to determine the crystal structure. The absolute configuration of the API can be confidently assigned relative to the chiral probe.







Abstract
Establishing the absolute configuration of chiral active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) is of great importance. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (scXRD) has traditionally been the method of choice for such analysis, but scXRD requires the growth of large crystals, which can be challenging. Here, we present a method for determining absolute configuration that does not rely on the growth of large crystals. By examining microcrystals formed with chiral probes (small chiral compounds such as amino acids), absolute configuration can be unambiguously determined by microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED). Our streamlined method employs three steps: (1) virtual screening to identify promising chiral probes, (2) experimental cocrystal screening and (3) structure determination by MicroED and absolute configuration assignment. We successfully applied this method to analyze two chiral API molecules currently on the market for which scXRD was not used to determine absolute configuration.

         <title>Automated Glycan Assembly of Mycobacterial Hexaarabinofuranoside and Docosasaccharide Arabinan (Arbf23) Motifs found on&#160;Mycobacterium tuberculosis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mycobacteria&#160;are covered in a thick layer of different polysaccharides that helps to avert the innate immune response. Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) and arabinogalactan (AG) are ubiquitously contained in these envelopes and rapid access to defined oligo&#8208; and polysaccharides is essential to elucidate their structural and biological roles. Arabinofuranose (Araf)residues in LAM and AG are connected either via&#160;&#945;&#8208;1,2&#8208;trans&#160;linkages that are synthetically straightforward to install or the more challenging&#160;&#946;&#8208;(1,2&#8208;cis) linkages. Here, we demonstrate that automated glycan assembly (AGA) can be used to quickly prepare 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Araf&#160;as illustrated by the assembly of a highly branched arabinan hexasaccharide and a docosasaccharide arabinan (Araf23) motif</dc:description>

         <title>Styrene Oxide Isomerase&#8208;Catalyzed Meinwald Rearrangement in Cascade Biotransformations: Synthesis of Chiral and/or Natural Chemicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Styrene oxide isomerase (SOI) catalyzes the Meinwald rearrangement of aryl epoxides to carbonyl compounds via a 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;shift in a stereospecific manner. A number of cascade biotransformations with SOI&#8208;catalyzed epoxide isomerization as a key step have been developed to convert readily available substrates into valuable chiral chemicals. Cascade conversion of terminal or internal alkenes into chiral acids, alcohols or amines were achieved, which involved SOI&#8208;catalyzed enantio&#8208;retentive isomerization of terminal epoxides via 1,2&#8208;H shift, or internal epoxides via 1,2&#8208;methyl shift. SOI&#8208;involved cascades were also developed to convert racemic epoxides into chiral acids or amines via dynamic kinetic resolution. Additionally, combining SOI&#8208;catalyzed isomerization with enantioselective C&#8211;C bond forming enzymes enabled the synthesis of chiral amino acids or amino alcohols from racemic epoxides. Finally, integration of SOI&#8208;involved cascades with biosynthesis pathways allowed for the direct utilization of renewable substrates for the sustainable synthesis of high&#8208;value natural chemicals such as alcohols, acids and esters.</dc:description>

         <title>An Atropisomerism Study of Large Cycloarylenes: [n]Cyclo&#8208;4,10&#8208;Pyrenylenes&#8217; Case</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An atropisomerism of large cycloarylenes was studied using [n]cyclo&#8208;4,10&#8208;pyrenylenes (n = 6&#8211;21) as an illustrative example with two simple assumptions: (1) alternating configurations (R,S,R,S,,,) are thermodynamically most stable, and (2) three consecutive identical configurations (R,R,R or S,S,S) are prevented. Ni&#8208;mediated coupling of a 5,9&#8208;diiodopyrene gave a series of directly&#8208;linked cyclic pyrene oligomers in one&#8208;pot reaction. As&#8208;synthesized cyclic hexamer was assigned as an (R,S,S,R,R,S) structure, converted into an (R,S,R,S,R,S)&#8208;form upon heating. Cyclic heptamer consists of two types of C2 symmetric structures predicted from assumption (2), one of which was convergent to one another by heating. Three atropisomers of cyclic octamer were analyzed from the possible five candidates by means of 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and the conversion process to (R,S,R,S,R,S,R,S) configurations upon heating was investigated. In total, according to two simple rules, the analysis of atropisomerism could be performed smoothly.</dc:description>

         <title>Antimicrobial Conjugated Oligoelectrolytes Containing Triphenylphosphonium Solubilizing Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conjugated oligoelectrolytes (COEs) are an emerging class of amphiphilic antimicrobial compounds with a modular molecular framework suitable for simple chemical derivatization. Here, a series of COE derivatives with a stilbene conjugated segment and triphenylphosphonium (TPP) pendant groups was designed and synthesized to understand how lipophilic cationic groups impact antimicrobial activity. In vitro evaluations against ESKAPE pathogens showed broad&#8208;spectrum activity towards multi&#8208;drug resistant (MDR) bacteria and mycobacteria, with TPP groups enhancing antimicrobial activity towards clinically&#8208;relevant Gram&#8208;negative strains compared to their ammonium analogues. We studied the interactions of DM6P, the most active TPP&#8208;COE compound, with various membrane assays. Treatment of bacterial cells with DM6P showed enhanced permeability of cell membranes without inducing significant bacterial resistance development. Moreover, DM6P eliminated 99.99% of methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphyloccocus aureus (MRSA) in an in vivo wound model. These results represent a promising chemical strategy for increasing the activity spectrum of membrane&#8208;active COE antibiotics to tackle challenging drug&#8208;resistant targets.</dc:description>

         <title>Emerging Trends in Closed&#8208;loop Recycling Polymers: Monomer Design and Catalytic Bulk Depolymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plastics are indispensable materials in modern society; however, their extensive use has contributed to the depletion of finite natural resources and caused severe environmental issues. One end&#8208;of&#8208;use solution for plastics involves the chemical recycling of polymers back to monomers for repolymerization to virgin polymers without changing the material properties, allowing the establishment of a circular material economy. This concept focuses on the critical advantages of chemically recyclable polymers in terms of monomer design, material properties, and the feasibility of bulk depolymerization. The recyclability via bulk thermolysis of various polyesters, CO2&#8208;based polycarbonates, and polyacetals produced via ring&#8208;opening polymerization is highlighted through discussions regarding rational monomer design and efficient catalyst development. An outlook and perspective are provided to delineate the future challenges in the rational design of monomer and polymer structures that deliver the desired materials performance while being suitable for bulk thermolysis with high (de)polymerization activity and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Buried Interface Regulation by Bio&#8208;Functional Molecules for Efficient and Stable Planar Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for planar&#8208;type perovskite solar cells by natural bio&#8208;functional interfaces that uses a buried electron&#8208;transport layer made of cobalamin complexed tin oxide (SnO2@B12) is provided. Cobalamin could chemically link SnO2 layer and perovskite layer, resulting in improved perovskite film quality and interfacial defect passivation.







Abstract
Among the factors that lead to the reduction of the efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) the difficulty involved in realizing a high&#8208;quality film and the efficient charge transfer that takes place at the interface between electron&#8208;transport layer (ETL) and perovskite is worth mentioning. Here, a strategy for planar&#8208;type devices by natural bio&#8208;functional interfaces that uses a buried electron&#8208;transport layer made of cobalamin complexed tin oxide (SnO2@B12) is demonstrated. Having systematically investigated the effects of SnO2@B12 interfacial layer in perovskite solar cells, it can be concluded that cobalamin can chemically link the SnO2 layer and the perovskite layer, resulting in improved perovskite film quality and interfacial defect passivation. Utilizing SnO2@B12 improves the efficiency of planar&#8208;type PSCs by 20.60&#8201;%. Furthermore, after 250&#8197;h of exposure to an ambient atmosphere, unsealed PSCs containing SnO2@B12 degrade by 10&#8201;%. This research provides a viable method for developing bio&#8208;functional molecules that will increase the effectiveness and durability of planar&#8208;perovskite solar cells.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A strategy for planar-type perovskite solar cells&lt;/b&gt; by natural bio-functional interfaces that uses a buried electron-transport layer made of cobalamin complexed tin oxide (SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;) is provided. Cobalamin could chemically link SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layer and perovskite layer, resulting in improved perovskite film quality and interfacial defect passivation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the factors that lead to the reduction of the efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) the difficulty involved in realizing a high-quality film and the efficient charge transfer that takes place at the interface between electron-transport layer (ETL) and perovskite is worth mentioning. Here, a strategy for planar-type devices by natural bio-functional interfaces that uses a buried electron-transport layer made of cobalamin complexed tin oxide (SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;) is demonstrated. Having systematically investigated the effects of SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; interfacial layer in perovskite solar cells, it can be concluded that cobalamin can chemically link the SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layer and the perovskite layer, resulting in improved perovskite film quality and interfacial defect passivation. Utilizing SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; improves the efficiency of planar-type PSCs by 20.60&#8201;%. Furthermore, after 250&#8197;h of exposure to an ambient atmosphere, unsealed PSCs containing SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; degrade by 10&#8201;%. This research provides a viable method for developing bio-functional molecules that will increase the effectiveness and durability of planar-perovskite solar cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Higher&#8208;Order Cycloaddition Reactions for the Construction of Polycyclic Aromatic and Polycyclic Heteroaromatic Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years, the interest in polycyclic (hetero)aromatic compounds has steadily increased as the versatility of these in material science are explored, for example in fluorescent probes and pyroelectronics. In this concept, recent advances in organocatalysed higher&#8208;order cycloadditions as a synthetic tool to access novel polycyclic (hetero)aromatic compounds are demonstrated.







Abstract
Cycloadditions are an important class of reactions in materials science for the construction of polycyclic aromatic and polycyclic heteroaromatic compounds. Recently, cycloadditions have been expanded beyond the &#8220;classical&#8221; group of cycloadditions involving six &#960;&#8208;electrons, and it is now possible to control cycloadditions for an extended number of &#960;&#8208;electrons by applying organocatalysis. This novel field of cycloadditions&#8211;termed higher&#8208;order cycloadditions&#8211;allows new synthetic methodologies to construct polycyclic carbo&#8208; and heteroaromatic compounds in two or three dimensions. This concept presents higher&#8208;order cycloadditions as a method for accessing two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional azulenes and cyclazines, as well as three dimensional indenes, as polycyclic aromatic and polycyclic heteroaromatic compounds.

         <title>Precise Control of Dissipative Self&#8208;assembly by Light and Electricity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nature&#8208;inspired synthetic dissipative self&#8208;assemblies have attracted much attention recently. However, it remains a major challenge to achieve precise control over dissipative supramolecular assembly structures and functions of self&#8208;contained systems. Here we combine light and electricity as two clean, and spatiotemporally addressable fuels to provide precise control over the morphology for dissipative self&#8208;assembly of a perylene bisimide glycine (PBIg) building block in a self&#8208;contained solution. In this design, electrochemical oxidation provides the positive fuel to activate PBIg self&#8208;assembly while photoreduction supplies the negative fuel to deactivate the system for disassembly. Through programming the two counteracting fuels, we demonstrated the control of PBIg self&#8208;assembly into a variety of assembly morphologies in a self&#8208;contained system. In addition, by exerting light and electrical dual fuels simultaneously, we could create an active homeostasis exhibiting dynamic instability, leading to morphological change to asymmetric assemblies with curvatures. Such precise control over self&#8208;assembly of self&#8208;contained systems may find future applications in programming complex active materials as well as formulating pharmaceutical reagents with desired morphologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Bringing Machine&#8208;Learning Enhanced Quantum Chemistry and Microwave Spectroscopy to Conformational Landscape Exploration: the Paradigmatic Case of 4&#8208;Fluoro&#8208;Threonine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A combined experimental and theoretical study has been carried out on 4&#8208;fluoro&#8208;threonine, the only naturally occurring fluorinated amino acid. Fluorination of the methyl group significantly increases the conformational complexity with respect to the parent amino acid threonine. The conformational landscape has been characterized in great detail, with special attention given to the inter&#8208;conversion pathways between different conformers. This led to the identification of 13 stable low&#8208;energy minima. The equilibrium population of so many conformers produces a very complicated and congested rotational spectrum that could be assigned through a strategy that combines several levels of quantum chemical calculations with the principles of machine learning. Twelve conformers out of 13 could be experimentally characterized. The results obtained from the analysis of the intra&#8208;molecular interactions can be exploited to accurately model fluorine&#8208;substitution effects in biomolecules.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Urokinase&#8208;type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) is a glycolipid&#8208;anchored protein located on the cell surface that is implicated in the promotion of metastasis. New fluorescent probes for the detection of uPAR expression that feature a rapid &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; response are here reported. They consist of a donor&#8208;p&#8208;acceptor&#8208;based fluorophore conjugated with a uPAR&#8208;binding AE105 peptide. The resulting AE105&#8208;coupled uPAR&#8208;targeting probes are weakly emissive in aqueous buffer solutions; however, a fluorescence &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; signal is instantly triggered upon specific binding to uPAR (KD = 63.2 nM for P1 and 49.5 nM for P2), which restricts the rotational deactivation of the fluorophore. Applications of the probes were demonstrated in the imaging of uPAR overexpressed on the membrane of cancer cell and in a cell&#8208;based uPAR inhibitor assay.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incompatibility of poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) with acidic ionic liquid electrolytes and the use of toxic and high&#8208;cost N&#8208;Methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) solvents hinder the wide application of aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs). In this work, sodium alginate (Na&#8208;Alg) is developed as an aqueous binder for the fabrication of graphite positive electrodes in AIBs. The compatibility of various binders with the ionic liquid electrolyte is evaluated, and interaction between various binders and graphite particles before and after cycling is compared and discussed. The results demonstrate that the well compatibility of Na&#8208;Alg in ionic liquids and its reasonable distribution on the graphite surface facilitate fast charge transfer and ion diffusion, reduce electrode polarization, and thus contributing to significantly improved cycling stability and rate capability of AIBs. This work provides a new insight into the development of low&#8208;cost, eco&#8208;friendly, and high&#8208;performance binders for AIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Electroreduction of Carbon Dioxide to Acetate using Heterogenized Hydrophilic Manganese Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tunable catalysts: Heterogeneous Mn&#8208;porphyrin molecular electrocatalysts are used to efficiently reduce CO2 to acetate in an aqueous environment with a selectivity of 62&#8201;% when immobilized on a glassy carbon electrode using a one&#8208;pot electrografting method. The vertical alignment and higher loading of the electrografted molecules is enabled by the hydrophilic sulfonate groups.







Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to value&#8208;added chemicals is a promising strategy to mitigate climate change. Metalloporphyrins have been used as a promising class of stable and tunable catalysts for the electrochemical reduction reaction of CO2 (CO2RR) but have been primarily restricted to single&#8208;carbon reduction products. Here, we utilize functionalized earth&#8208;abundant manganese tetraphenylporphyrin&#8208;based (Mn&#8208;TPP) molecular electrocatalysts that have been immobilized via electrografting onto a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) to convert CO2 with overall 94&#8201;% Faradaic efficiencies, with 62&#8201;% being converted to acetate. Tuning of Mn&#8208;TPP with electron&#8208;withdrawing sulfonate groups (Mn&#8208;TPPS) introduced mechanistic changes arising from the electrostatic interaction between the sulfonate groups and water molecules, resulting in better surface coverage, which facilitated higher conversion rates than the non&#8208;functionalized Mn&#8208;TPP.

     alt="Electroreduction of Carbon Dioxide to Acetate using Heterogenized Hydrophilic Manganese Porphyrins"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tunable catalysts&lt;/b&gt;: Heterogeneous Mn-porphyrin molecular electrocatalysts are used to efficiently reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to acetate in an aqueous environment with a selectivity of 62&#8201;% when immobilized on a glassy carbon electrode using a one-pot electrografting method. The vertical alignment and higher loading of the electrografted molecules is enabled by the hydrophilic sulfonate groups.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to value-added chemicals is a promising strategy to mitigate climate change. Metalloporphyrins have been used as a promising class of stable and tunable catalysts for the electrochemical reduction reaction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) but have been primarily restricted to single-carbon reduction products. Here, we utilize functionalized earth-abundant manganese tetraphenylporphyrin-based (Mn-TPP) molecular electrocatalysts that have been immobilized via electrografting onto a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) to convert CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with overall 94&#8201;% Faradaic efficiencies, with 62&#8201;% being converted to acetate. Tuning of Mn-TPP with electron-withdrawing sulfonate groups (Mn-TPPS) introduced mechanistic changes arising from the electrostatic interaction between the sulfonate groups and water molecules, resulting in better surface coverage, which facilitated higher conversion rates than the non-functionalized Mn-TPP. For Mn-TPP only carbon monoxide and formate were detected as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction products. Density-functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that the additional sulfonate groups could alter the C&#8722;C coupling pathway from *CO&#8594;*COH&#8594;*COH-CO to *CO&#8594;*CO-CO&#8594;*COH-CO, reducing the free energy barrier of C&#8722;C coupling in the case of Mn-TPPS. This opens a new approach to designing metalloporphyrin catalysts for two carbon products in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Magnetic Anisotropy and Relaxation of Pseudotetrahedral [N2O2] Bis&#8208;Chelate Cobalt(II) Single&#8208;Ion Magnets Controlled by Dihedral Twist Through Solvomorphism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt(II)&#8208;based single&#8208;ion magnet is described, for which the zero&#8208;field splitting could be increased by driving the dihedral twist distortion between the planes of the chelate ligands to a new record level. FD&#8208;FT THz&#8208;EPR experiments were used to validate the corroborating ab initio calculations and susceptibility data, and enabled magnetic relaxation analysis identifying spin&#8208;phonon coupling processes.







Abstract
The methanol solvomorph 1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2MeOH of the cobalt(II) complex [Co(LSal,2&#8722;Ph)2] (1) with the sterically demanding Schiff&#8208;base ligand 2&#8208;(([1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;2&#8208;ylimino)methyl)phenol (HLSal,2&#8722;Ph) shows the thus far largest dihedral twist distortion between the two chelate planes compared to an ideal pseudotetrahedral arrangement. The cobalt(II) ion in 1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2MeOH exhibits an easy&#8208;axis anisotropy leading to a spin&#8208;reversal barrier of 55.3&#8197;cm&#8722;1, which corresponds to an increase of about 17&#8201;% induced by the larger dihedral twist compared to the solvent&#8208;free complex 1. The magnetic relaxation for 1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2MeOH is significantly slower compared to 1. An in&#8208;depth frequency&#8208;domain Fourier&#8208;transform (FD&#8208;FT) THz&#8208;EPR study not only allowed the direct measurement of the magnetic transition between the two lowest Kramers doublets for the cobalt(II) complexes, but also revealed the presence of spin&#8208;phonon coupling. Interestingly, a similar dihedral twist correlation is also observed for a second pair of cobalt(II)&#8208;based solvomorphs, which could be benchmarked by FD&#8208;FT THz&#8208;EPR.

         <title>Molecular Design and Crystal Chemistry of Polyfluorinated Naphthalene&#8208;bis&#8208;phenylhydrazimides with Superior Thermal and Polymorphic Stability and High Solution Processability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyfluorinated naphthalene&#8208;bis&#8208;phenylhydrazimides show high chemical and thermal inertness, possess rather low LUMO energies (down to &#8722;4.37&#8197;eV) and significantly high solubilities. All these features indicate that they are promising n&#8208;type semiconductors for a variety of organic electronics applications.







Abstract
Naphthalene tetracarboxylic diimides (NDIs) are highly promising air&#8208;stable n&#8208;type molecular semiconductor candidates for flexible and cost&#8208;effective organic solar cells and thermoelectrics. Nonetheless, thermal and polymorphic stabilities of environmentally stable NDIs in the low&#8208;to&#8208;medium temperature regime (&lt;300&#8201;&#176;C) remain challenging properties. Structural, thermal, spectroscopic, and computational features of polyfluorinated NDI&#8208;based molecular solids (with up to 14 F atoms per NDI molecule) are discussed upon increasing the fluorination level. Slip&#8208;stacked arrangement of the NDI cores with suitable &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and systematically short interplanar distances (&lt;3.2&#8197;&#197;) are found. All these materials exhibit superior thermal stability (up to 260&#8201;&#176;C or above) and thermal expansion coefficients indicating a response compatible with flexible polymeric substrates. Optical bandgaps increase from 2.78 to 2.93&#8197;eV with fluorination, while LUMO energy levels decrease down to &#8722;4.37&#8197;eV, as shown per DFT calculations. The compounds exhibit excellent solubility of 30&#8197;mg mL&#8722;1 in 1,4&#8208;dioxane and DMF.

The resultant molecules exhibited broad absorption in the range of 325 &#8208; 600 nm in solutions and in thin films the absorption range is 350 &#8208; 700 nm. These new conjugated small molecules showed low&#8208;lying HOMO energy levels (&#8722; 5.49 to &#8722; 5.50 eV), deep LUMO energy levels (&#8722;3.67 to &#8722;3.69 eV) and narrow bandgaps of (EgCV) ~ 1.79 eV. Appreciable&#8208;electron mobilities for compounds BT&#8208;IBT2 and BT2F&#8208;IBT3 were 4.56 &#215; 10&#8722;3 and 1.12 &#215; 10&#8722;3 cm2/Vs respectively obtained by space&#8208;charge limited current (SCLC) measurements. Additionally, excellent photocatalytic performances of BT&#8208;2T (6), BT2F&#8208;2T (10), BT&#8208;IT1, BT&#8208;IBT2 and BT2F&#8208;IBT3 for highly selective oxidation of thioanisole to desired sulfoxides under visible light irradiation were observed.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantum Yield of DNA Strand Breaks under Photoexcitation of a Molecular Ruby</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) used for treating cancer relies on the generation of highly reactive oxygen species, e.g. singlet oxygen 1O2, by light&#8208;induced excitation of a photosensitizer (PS) in the presence of molecular oxygen, inducing DNA damage in close proximity of the PS. Although many precious metal complexes have been explored as PS for PDT and received clinical approval, only recently, the potential of photoactive complexes of bio&#8208;essential metals as PS was discovered. Using the DNA origami technology that can absolutely quantify DNA strand break cross sections, we assessed the potential of the luminescent transition metal complex [Cr(ddpd)2]3+ (ddpd = N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;dipyridine&#8208;2&#8208;ylpyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diamine) to damage DNA in an air&#8208;saturated aqueous environment upon low energy UV/Vis illumination. The quantum yield for strand breakage, i.e., the ratio of DNA strand breaks to the number of absorbed photons, was determined to 1 &#8211; 4%, indicating efficient transformation of photons into DNA strand breaks by [Cr(ddpd)2]3+.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of sterically encumbered alkaline&#8208;earth metal amides applying the in&#8208;situ Grignard reagent formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Magnesium and calcium are too inert to deprotonate amines directly. For the synthesis of bulky amides alternative strategies are required and in the past, N&#8208;bound trialkylsilyl groups have been used to ease metalation reactions. The in&#8208;situ Grignard reagent formation in stirred suspensions of magnesium or calcium with hydryl halide and imine in THF allows the synthesis of a plethora of amides with bulky silyl&#8208;free substituents. Ball milling protocols partially favor competitive side reactions such as aza&#8208;pinacol coupling reactions. Calcium is the advantageous choice for the in&#8208;situ Grignard reagent formation and subsequent addition onto the imines yielding bulky calcium bis(amides) whereas the stronger reducing heavier alkaline&#8208;earth metals strontium and barium are less selective and hence, the aza&#8208;pinacol coupling reaction becomes competitive. Exemplary, the solid&#8208;state molecular structures of [(Et2O)Mg(N(Ph)(CHPh2)2] and [(Et2O)2Ca(N(Ph)(CHPh2)2] have been determined.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivity of oxygen&#8208;bridged geminal Al/P and Si/P Frustrated Lewis Pairs towards heterocumulenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The two oxygen&#8208;bridged geminal Frustrated Lewis Pairs (FLP) tBu2P&#8211;O&#8211;AlBis2 (Bis = CH(SiMe3)2, 1) and tBu2P&#8211;O&#8211;Si(C2F5)3 (2) were reacted with the heterocumulenes PhNCO, PhOCN, PhNCS, CS2 and PhNSO as well as SO2. With isocyanate and cyanate, both 1 and 2, form addition products under formation of five&#8208;membered rings. With CS2, isothiocyanate and sulfinylaniline only 1 forms stable adducts, while 2 shows reactivity towards sulfinylaniline but the product decomposed after several minutes. The reaction of 1 with SO2 led to a partial cleavage of the P&#8208;O&#8208;Al and Al&#8208;C units, confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of a complex aggregate. The reaction of 2 with SO2 affords the 1,2&#8208;addition product. All adducts were characterized by means of multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography and CHN analyses.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of B4N4&#8208;Heteropentalenes Fused with Polycyclic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hybrid molecules of &#960;&#8208;conjugated carbon rings and BN&#8208;heterocyclic rings (h&#8208;CBNs) fused with each other have been a rare class of compounds due to the limited availability of their synthetic methods. Here we report the synthesis of new h&#8208;CBNs (1, Figure 1d) featuring a B4N4&#8208;heteropentalene core and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon wings. Using 1,2&#8208;azaborinine derivatives as a building block, we developed a rational synthetic protocol that allows the formation of a B4N4 ring in a stepwise manner, resulting in the fully fused ABA&#8208;type triblock molecules. Thus, three derivatives of 1 bearing naphthalene (1Naph), anthracene (1Anth), or phenanthrene (1Phen) wings fused with the B4N4 core were synthesized and characterized. Among them, 1Phen which displays the highest triplet&#8208;state energy was found to serve a host material for phosphorescent OLED devices, for which a maximum external quantum efficiency of 13.7% was recorded. These findings may promote the synthesis of various types of h&#8208;CBNs aiming at new properties arising from the synergy of two different &#960;&#8208;electronic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Advances in Selective Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation of Alkynes to Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes is a potential candidate to traditional thermocatalytic process. Alkynes adsorption, hydrogenation and alkenes desorption intrinsically determine the activity and alkene selectivity. In this review, the advances in electrocatalysts and electrolyzers for selective hydrogenation of alkynes are focused.







Abstract
Selective electrochemical hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes under ambient conditions is a promising alternative to the traditional energy&#8208;intensive and high&#8208;cost thermocatalytic hydrogenation. However, the systematic summary on the electrocatalysts and electrolyzers remains lacked. Herein, we demonstrate a comprehensive review about recent achievements in the electrocatalysts including noble metal and non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal materials. Several effective strategies of catalyst design were developed to improve alkyne conversion, and alkene selectivity, for example, accelerating the formation of active hydrogen species, enhancing alkyne adsorption and suppressing the side reactions. Furthermore, the advantages and disadvantages of various electrolyzers are systematically discussed. Accordingly, major challenges and future trends in this field are proposed.

         <title>CRISPR/Cas&#8208;Based MicroRNA Biosensors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of efficient biosensors for miRNA assay is essential for disease diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis. CRISPR/Cas system possesses high fidelity, precise localization capability, and efficient cleavage activity, making it attractive in biosensing applications. In this review, the recent advances in the development of CRISPR/Cas&#8208;based biosensors for miRNAs assay are discussed.







Abstract
As important post&#8208;transcriptional regulators, microRNAs (miRNAs) play irreplaceable roles in diverse cellular functions. Dysregulated miRNA expression is implicated in various diseases including cancers, and thus miRNAs have become the valuable biomarkers for disease monitoring. Recently, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR&#8208;associated (CRISPR/Cas) system has shown great promise for the development of next&#8208;generation biosensors because of its precise localization capability, good fidelity, and high cleavage activity. Herein, we review recent advance in development of CRISPR/Cas&#8208;based biosensors for miRNA detection. We summarize the principles, features, and performance of these miRNA biosensors, and further highlight the remaining challenges and future directions.

         <title>Red&#8208;to&#8208;Near&#8208;Infrared Emitting PyrrolylBODIPY Dyes: Synthesis, Photophysical Properties and Bioimaging Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Series of pyrrolylBODIPYs were regioselectively synthesized through SNAr reactions between pyrroles and 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrachloroBODIPYs or 3,5&#8208;dibromoBODIPY. The resulting pyrrolylBODIPYs with 5&#8208;Cl substituent can be further functionalized to give a series of red&#8208;to&#8208;near&#8208;infrared emitting dyes and a mitochondrial localization fluorescent probe was further developed.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorophores with characteristics such as deep tissue penetration, minimal damage to the biological samples, and low background interference, are highly sought&#8208;after materials for in&#8197;vivo and deep&#8208;tissue fluorescence imaging. Herein, series of 3&#8208;pyrrolylBODIPY derivatives and 3,5&#8208;dipyrrolylBODIPY derivatives have been prepared by a facile regioselective nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction (SNAr) on 3,5&#8208;halogenated BODIPY derivatives (3,5&#8208;dibromo or 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrachloroBODIPYs) with pyrroles. The installation of a pyrrolic unit onto the 3&#8208;position of the BODIPY chromophore leads to a dramatic red shift of both the absorption (up to 160&#8197;nm) and the emission (up to 260&#8197;nm) in these resultant 3&#8208;pyrrolylBODIPYs with respect to that of the BODIPY chromophore. Their further 5&#8208;positional functionalization provides a facile way to fine tune their photophysical properties, and these resulting dipyrrolylBODIPYs and functionalized pyrrolylBODIPYs show strong absorption in the deep red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR regions (595&#8211;684&#8197;nm) and intense NIR fluorescence emission (650&#8211;715&#8197;nm) in dichloromethane. To demonstrate the applicability of these functionalized pyrrolylBODIPYs as NIR fluorescent probes for cell imaging, pyrrolylBODIPY 6&#8201;a containing mitochondrion&#8208;targeting butyltriphenylphosphonium cationic species was also prepared. It selectively localized in mitochondria of HeLa cells, with low cytotoxicity and intense deep red fluorescence emission.

         <title>Direct Observation of Charge, Energy, and Hydrogen Transfer between the Backbone and Nucleobases in Isolated DNA Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphorus atoms were targeted in the backbone of gas&#8208;phase oligonucleotide anions and cations, by means of resonant photoabsorption at the L&#8208; and K&#8208;edges. The ionic photoproducts of the excitation process were studied by a combination of mass spectrometry and X&#8208;ray spectroscopy. Charge and/or energy as well as H transfer from the backbone to nucleobases was directly observed and investigated.







Abstract
Understanding how charge and energy, as well as protons and hydrogen atoms, are transferred in molecular systems as a result of an electronic excitation is fundamental for understanding the interaction between ionizing radiation and biological matter on the molecular level. To localize the excitation at the atomic scale, it was chosen to target phosphorus atoms in the backbone of gas&#8208;phase oligonucleotide anions and cations, by means of resonant photoabsorption at the L&#8208; and K&#8208;edges. The ionic photoproducts of the excitation process were studied by a combination of mass spectrometry and X&#8208;ray spectroscopy. The combination of absorption site selectivity and photoproduct sensitivity allowed the identification of X&#8208;ray spectral signatures of specific processes. Moreover, charge and/or energy as well as H transfer from the backbone to nucleobases has been directly observed. Although the probability of one versus two H transfer following valence ionization depends on the nucleobase, ionization of sugar or phosphate groups at the carbon K&#8208;edge or the phosphorus L&#8208;edge mainly leads to single H transfer to protonated adenine. Moreover, our results indicate a surprising proton&#8208;transfer process to specifically form protonated guanine after excitation or ionization of P 2p electrons.

         <dc:description>Piezochromic materials, which exhibit a fluorescence response with large emission spectral shifts and high sensitivity, may be useful in important applications, but there have been few reports of such organic luminophores. Herein, we report a new high&#8208;sensitivity piezochromic material based on the incorporation of an o&#8208;carborane unit, which exhibits aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties. In a high&#8208;pressure experiment, compared to carborane&#8208;free MTY, which exhibits an emission spectral shift of 75 nm and a sensitivity of 19.1 nm&#8226;GPa&#8208;1, the o&#8208;carborane dyad MTCb shows a larger emission wavelength difference of 131 nm and a higher sensitivity of 32.8 nm&#8226;GPa&#8208;1, demonstrating a performance that ranks among the best of organic piezochromic materials reported thus far. MTCb molecules adopt a J&#8208;aggregated pattern and have relatively loose molecular packing in the crystalline state. Interestingly, nonconjugated spherical carborane can disrupt the &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between adjacent molecules during compression, which results in excellent piezochromic performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Helicene&#8208;Containing Arenes for Optical Limiting Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A helicene&#8208;containing arene and its linear analogue have been successfully synthesized and characterized, where the single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis indicates that the former can arrange in an offset packing style with a &#960;&#8208;&#960; overlap. The introduction of pentagon&#8208;rings into the parent skeletons in the resulting compounds can boost the stability, and such helicene&#8208;containing molecule possesses higher solubility in organic solvent than the linear analogue. The structural difference has significantly influenced the optical limiting performance. The former in solution and in doped gel glass presents higher optical limiting response towards 532 nm laser than the latter. This study can enrich the functionalization of helicene, which can possess a positive effect in terms of nonlinear optical property.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A hexaphenyltriphenylene&#8208;based hexatopic pyridyl ligand is designed and used to prepare three hexagonal prismatic metallacages via metal&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. Owing to the planar conjugated structures of the hexaphenyltriphenylene skeleton, such metallacages show good host&#8722;guest complexation with a series of emissive dyes,&#160; which have been further used to tune their emission in solution. Interestingly, based on their complementary emission colors, white light emission is achieved in a mixture of the host metallacages and the guests.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermally Activated vs. Photochemical Hydrogen Evolution Reactions &#8211; a Tale of Three Metals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular processes behind hydrogen evolution reactions can be quite complex. In macroscopic electrochemical cells, it is extremely difficult to elucidate and understand their mechanism. Gas phase models, consisting of a metal ion and a small number of water molecules, provide unique opportunities to understand the reaction pathways in great detail. Hydrogen evolution in clusters consisting of a singly charged metal ion and one to on the order of 50 water molecules has been studied extensively for magnesium, aluminum and vanadium. Such clusters with around 10&#8211;20 water molecules are known to eliminate atomic or molecular hydrogen upon mild activation by room temperature black&#8208;body radiation. Irradiation with ultraviolet light, however, enables hydrogen evolution already with a single water molecule. Here, we analyze and compare the reaction mechanisms for hydrogen evolution on the ground state as well as excited state potential energy surfaces. Five distinct mechanisms for evolution of atomic or molecular hydrogen are identified and characterized.</dc:description>

         <title>Selectivity in Cationic Cyclizations Involving Alkynes: a Computational Study on Biomimetic Synthesis of Steroids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Computational studies on the electrophilic cyclization between alkynes and transient carbocations or Lewis acid activated epoxides show that the regiochemistry of the reaction depends on the terminal or internal position of the triple bond. Reactants possessing terminal alkynyl groups lead to six&#8208;membered rings whereas internal alkynes yield five&#8208;membered rings via 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig and 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig electrophilic cyclizations, respectively. The regiochemistry of the reaction is not determined by two&#8208;electron interactions, but by minimization of Pauli repulsion. This scenario is preserved in related biomimetic reactions leading to steroid scaffolds. In this latter case, the stereochemistry of the cyclization reaction is oriented towards the formation of equatorial C&#8208;C bonds connecting the new six&#8208;six&#8208; and six&#8208;five&#8208;membered fused rings.</dc:description>

         <title>Crown Ether&#8208;Based Ion Transporters in Bilayer Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bilayer membranes that enhance the stability of the cell are essential for cell survival, separating and protecting the interior of the cell from its external environment. Membrane&#8208;based channel proteins are crucial for sustaining cellular activities. However, dysfunction of these proteins would induce serial channelopathies, which could be substituted by artificial ion channel analogs. Crown ethers (CEs) are widely studied in the area of artificial ion channels owing to their intrinsic host&#8208;guest interaction with different kinds of organic and inorganic ions. Other advantages such as lower price, chemical stability, and easier modification also make CE a research hotspot in the field of synthetic transmembrane nanopores. And numerous CEs&#8208;based membrane&#8208;active synthetic ion channels were designed and fabricated in the past decades. Herein, the recent progress of CEs&#8208;based synthetic ion transporters has been comprehensively summarized in this review, including their design principles, functional mechanisms, controllable properties, and biomedical applications. Furthermore, this review has been concluded by discussing the future opportunities and challenges facing this research field. It is anticipated that this review could offer some inspiration for the future fabrication of novel CEs&#8208;derived ion transporters with more advanced structures, properties, and practical applications.</dc:description>

Other advantages such as lower price, chemical stability, and easier modification also make CE a research hotspot in the field of synthetic transmembrane nanopores. And numerous CEs-based membrane-active synthetic ion channels were designed and fabricated in the past decades. Herein, the recent progress of CEs-based synthetic ion transporters has been comprehensively summarized in this review, including their design principles, functional mechanisms, controllable properties, and biomedical applications. Furthermore, this review has been concluded by discussing the future opportunities and challenges facing this research field. It is anticipated that this review could offer some inspiration for the future fabrication of novel CEs-derived ion transporters with more advanced structures, properties, and practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Theoretical calculations on metal catalysts toward water&#8208;gas shift reaction: a review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water&#8208;gas shift (WGS) reaction offers a dominating path to hydrogen generation from fossil fuel, in which heterogeneous metal catalysts play a crucial part in this course. In this review, we highlighted and summarized recent developments on theoretical calculations of metal catalysts developed to date, including surface structure (e.g., monometallic and polymetallic systems) and interface structure (e.g., supported catalysts and metal oxide composites), with special emphasis on the characteristics of crystal&#8208;face effect, alloying strategy, and metal&#8208;support interaction. A systematic summarization on reaction mechanism was performed, including redox mechanism, associative mechanism as well as hybrid mechanism; the development on chemical kinetics (e.g., molecular dynamics, kinetic Monte Carlo and microkinetic simulation) was then introduced. At the end, we discussed the challenges associated with theoretical calculations on metal catalysts toward WGS reaction and provided some perspectives on the future advance of this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Particle Measurements: A Powerful Method for Investigating Electrochemical Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 7, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;particle measurements have been applied in the field of electrochemical energy storage as well as electrocatalysis, and great achievements have been made in terms of understanding the evolution and kinetics of electrodes.







Abstract
The relationship between interface structure (e.&#8201;g., the facet of the solid phase and the configuration of solvation) and the reactivity of the corresponding electrode is a critical issue in electrochemistry. Compared to macroscopic electrode measurements, electrochemical methods established on the single&#8208;particle scale have advantages in establishing the structure&#8208;property relationship. In recent years, great achievements have been made in electrochemical energy storage and electrocatalysis that allow the evolution and kinetics of electrodes to be understood by employing single&#8208;particle measurements. This concept aims to provide an overview of the update of single&#8208;particle measurements in related electrochemical processes. Furthermore, the challenges and prospects for the development and application of single&#8208;particle measurements are also discussed.

Structure&#8211;activity Relationships in Nucleic&#8208;Acid&#8208;Templated Vectors Based on Peptidic Dynamic Covalent Polymers (M. Barboiu, N. Bettache, S. Ulrich et&#8197;al.), @DDSU0407; @M_Cste; @MihailBarboiu; @IBMM_Balard







Abstract
The use of nucleic acids as templates, which can trigger the self&#8208;assembly of their own vectors represent an emerging, simple and versatile, approach toward the self&#8208;fabrication of tailored nucleic acids delivery vectors. However, the structure&#8208;activity relationships governing this complex templated self&#8208;assembly process that accompanies the complexation of nucleic acids remains poorly understood. Herein, the class of arginine&#8208;rich dynamic covalent polymers (DCPs) composed of different monomers varying the number and position of arginines were studied. The combinations that lead to nucleic acid complexation, in saline buffer, using different templates, from short siRNA to long DNA, are described. Finally, a successful peptidic DCP featuring six&#8208;arginine repeating unit that promote the safe and effective delivery of siRNA in live cancer cells was identified.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding in Platinum Indolylphosphine Polyfluorido and Fluorido Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 7, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tune it! Platinum fluorido and polyfluorido complexes stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen were synthesized. X&#8208;ray data suggest a lower trans influence for electron withdrawing aryl ligands in the para position to the fluoride, but simultaneously a larger cis influence was observed, which is mirrored by the 1J(P,Pt) coupling constants. The |1J(F,Pt)| coupling constants were found to be smaller for fluorido complexes when compared to polyfluorido complexes.







Abstract
The reaction of the Pt complexes cis&#8208;[Pt(CH3)(Ar){Ph2P(Ind)}2] (Ind=2&#8208;(3&#8208;methyl)indolyl, Ar=4&#8208;tBuC6H4 (1&#8201;a), 4&#8208;CH3C6H4 (1&#8201;b), Ph (1&#8201;c), 4&#8208;FC6H4 (1&#8201;d), 4&#8208;ClC6H4 (1&#8201;e), 4&#8208;CF3C6H4 (1&#8201;f)) with HF afforded the polyfluorido complexes trans&#8208;[Pt(F(HF)2)(Ar){Ph2P(Ind)}2] 2&#8201;a&#8211;f, which can be converted into the fluoride derivatives trans&#8208;[Pt(F)(Ar){Ph2P(Ind)}2] (3&#8201;a&#8211;f) by treatment with CsF. The compounds 2&#8201;a&#8211;f and 3&#8201;a&#8211;f were characterised thoroughly by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. The data reveal hydrogen bonding of the fluorido ligand with HF molecules and the indolylphosphine ligand. Polyfluorido complexes 2&#8201;a&#8211;f show larger |1J(F,Pt)|, but lower 1J(H,F) coupling constants when compared to the fluorido complexes 3&#8201;a&#8211;f. Decreasing 1J(P,Pt) coupling constants in 2&#8201;a&#8211;f and 3&#8201;a&#8211;f suggest a cis influence of the aryl ligands in the following order: 4&#8208;tBuC6H4 (a) &#8776;4&#8208;CH3C6H4 (b)&lt;Ph (c)&#8810;4&#8208;FC6H4 (d)&lt;4&#8208;ClC6H4 (e)&lt;4&#8208;CF3C6H4 (f). In addition, the larger cis influence of aryl ligands bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups in the para position correlates with decreasing magnitudes of |1J(F,Pt)| coupling constants. The interpretation of the experimental data was supported by quantum&#8208;chemical DFT calculations.

         <title>Sulfation of Heparan and Chondroitin Sulfate Ligands Enables Cell&#8208;Specific Homing of Nanoprobes</title>

Synthetic ligands for nanoprobes: GAG nanoprobes composed of synthetic heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate ligands give a broad picture of cell&#8208;specific homing of nanoparticles and provide a novel opportunity for nanomedicine. Chondroitin sulfate E is a potential ligand for designing nanoprobes to target CD44&#8208;overexpressed cancer cells and neurites.







Abstract
Demystifying the sulfation code of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) to induce precise homing of nanoparticles in tumor cells or neurons influences the development of a potential drug&#8208; or gene&#8208;delivery system. However, GAGs, particularly heparan sulfate (HS) and chondroitin sulfate (CS), are structurally highly heterogeneous, and synthesizing well&#8208;defined HS/CS composed nanoparticles is challenging. Here, we decipher how specific sulfation patterns on HS and CS regulate receptor&#8208;mediated homing of nanoprobes in primary and secondary cells. We discovered that aggressive cancer cells such as MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 displayed a strong uptake of GAG&#8208;nanoprobes compared to mild or moderately aggressive cancer cells. However, there was no selectivity towards the GAG sequences, thus indicating the presence of more than one form of receptor&#8208;mediated uptake. However, U87 cells, olfactory bulb, and hippocampal primary neurons showed selective or preferential uptake of CS&#8208;E&#8208;coated nanoprobes compared to other GAG&#8208;nanoprobes. Furthermore, mechanistic studies revealed that the 4,6&#8208;O&#8208;disulfated&#8208;CS nanoprobe used the CD44 and caveolin&#8208;dependent endocytosis pathway for uptake. These results could lead to new opportunities to use GAG nanoprobes in nanomedicine.

         <title>Rational Design of a Triple Tumor Microenvironment&#8208;Responsive Nanoplatform for Enhanced Tumor Theranostics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 7, February 1, 2023. </description>

A novel multiple TMEs&#8208;responsive nanoplatform was designed and synthesized. The nanoplatform constructed by of rare earth nanoparticles and layered double&#8208;hydroxides (LDHs), It serves as a TMEs stimulation response nanoplatform for enhanced synergistic therapy.







Abstract
The development of responsive nanoplatforms based on the tumor microenvironment (TME) is critical for tumor diagnosis and treatment. Concentrating on a single TME&#8208;responsive nanoplatform, however, may result in insufficient diagnostic accuracy and treatment efficacy. Herein, layered double&#8208;hydroxides (LDHs) and rare earth nanomaterials (Er@Lu) were combined to create a triple TME&#8208;responsive nanoplatform that was then modified with cypate (a fluorescent dye with strong absorbance) by a peptide chain and loaded with epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a chemotherapeutic drug. Multiple responses to TME occurred when Er@Lu/LDH&#8208;EGCG reached the colorectal tumor region. Based on an acidic TME, the nanoplatform cracked and released Ni2+ and EGCG. NiS, which was produced by the reaction of Ni2+ with abundant H2S in tumor cells, was used for photothermal therapy and the released EGCG was used for chemotherapy. The MMP&#8208;7 enzyme specifically expressed in tumor cells recognized and cut the peptide chain, resulting in cypate release. The fluorescence of the Er@Lu was then restored along with the release of cypate because of the absorption competition disappearance. Compared to a single TME response, Er@Lu/LDH&#8208;EGCG with a triple TME response led to a better synergistic therapeutic effect in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. This work has provided new approaches for developing multiple TME&#8208;responsive therapeutic nanoplatforms for synergistic therapy with improved diagnosis and therapeutic efficiency.

         <title>The Transformation of Inorganic to Organic Carbonates: Chasing for Reaction Pathways in Mechanochemistry</title>

The synthesis of the green organic solvent diethyl carbonate by mechanochemistry starting from inorganic carbonates is used as target system to light up the &#8216;black box&#8217; with its heavily vibrating, dense milling vessels. The complementary combination of milling parameter studies, synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction real time monitoring, and quantum chemical calculations reveals the underlying reaction pathways and intermediates.







Abstract
Mechanochemical reactions are solvent&#8208;free alternatives to solution&#8208;based syntheses enabling even conventionally impossible transformations. Their reaction pathways, however, usually remain unexplored within the heavily vibrating, dense milling vessels. Here, we showcase how the green organic solvent diethyl carbonate is synthesized mechanochemically from inorganic alkali carbonates and how the complementary combination of milling parameter studies, synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction real time monitoring, and quantum chemical calculations reveal the underlying reaction pathways. With this, reaction intermediates are identified, and chemical concepts of solution&#8208;chemistry are challenged or corroborated for mechanochemistry.

         <title>Experimentally Calibrated Computational Prediction Enables Accurate Fine&#8208;Tuning of Near&#8208;Infrared Rhodamines for Multiplexing</title>

Calibration to experimental data produces accurate computational predictions of NIR dye absorbance and emission for unknown derivatives, allowing for identification of fine&#8208;tuning modifications.







Abstract
A significant barrier inhibiting multiplexed imaging in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) is the extensive trial and error associated with fine&#8208;tuning NIR dyes. In particular, the need to synthesize and experimentally evaluate dye derivatives in order to empirically identify those that can be used in multiplexing applications, requires a large investment of time. While coarse&#8208;tuning efforts benefit from computational prediction that can be used to identify target dye structures for synthetic campaigns, errors in computational prediction remain too large to accurately parse modifications aimed at fine&#8208;tuning changes in dye absorbance and emission. To address this issue, we screened different levels of theory and identified a time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) approach that can rapidly, as opposed to synthesis and experimental evaluation, estimate absorbance and emission. By calibrating these computational estimations of absorbance and emission to experimentally determined parameters for a panel of existing NIR dyes, we obtain calibration curves that can be used to accurately predict the effect of fine&#8208;tuning modifications in new dyes. We demonstrate the predictive power of this calibrated dataset using seven previously unreported dyes, obtaining mean percent errors in absorbance and emission of 2.2 and 2.8&#8201;%, respectively. This approach provides a significant timesavings, relative to synthesis and evaluation of dye derivatives, and can be used to focus synthetic campaigns on the most promising dye structures. The new dyes described herein can be utilized for multiplexed imaging, and the experimentally calibrated dataset will provide the dye chemistry community with a means to rapidly identify fine&#8208;tuned NIR dyes in silico to guide subsequent synthetic campaigns.

         <title>Observation and Characterization of the Hg&#8208;O Diatomic Molecule: A Matrix&#8208;Isolation and Quantum&#8208;Chemical Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 7, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mercury atoms from laser ablation of a dental amalgam target react with oxygen atoms upon co&#8208;condensation in excess argon and neon, and they provide frequencies of 521.2 and 529.0&#8197;cm&#8722;1, respectively, which support high&#8208;level calculations for this weakly bound Hg&#8722;O diatomic molecule. The small difference between our neon and argon matrix observations for Hg&#8722;O suggest a slightly ionic molecule. Spectra are also observed for Hg&#8208;O2 and Hg&#8208;O3.







Abstract
Mercuric oxide is a well&#8208;known and stable solid, but the diatomic molecule Hg&#8722;O is very fragile and does not survive detection in the gas phase. However, laser ablation of Hg atoms from a dental amalgam alloy target into argon or neon containing about 0.3&#8201;% of 16O2 or of 18O2 during their condensation into a cryogenic matrix at 4&#8197;K allows the formation of O atoms which react on annealing to make ozone and new IR absorptions in solid argon at 521.2&#8197;cm&#8722;1 for Hg&#8208;16O or at 496.4&#8197;cm&#8722;1 for Hg&#8208;18O with the oxygen isotopic frequency ratio 521.2/496.4=1.0499. Solid neon gives a 529.0&#8197;cm&#8722;1 absorption with a small 7.8&#8197;cm&#8722;1 blue shift. CCSD(T) calculations found 594&#8197;cm&#8722;1 for Hg16O and 562&#8197;cm&#8722;1 for Hg18O (frequency ratio=1.0569). Such calculations usually produce harmonic frequencies that are slightly higher than the anharmonic (observed) values, which supports their relationship. These observed frequencies have the isotopic shift predicted for Hg&#8722;O and are within the range of recent high&#8208;level frequency calculations for the Hg&#8722;O molecule. Spectra for the related mercury superoxide and ozonide species are also considered for the first time.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mercury atoms&lt;/b&gt; from laser ablation of a dental amalgam target react with oxygen atoms upon co-condensation in excess argon and neon, and they provide frequencies of 521.2 and 529.0&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, which support high-level calculations for this weakly bound Hg&#8722;O diatomic molecule. The small difference between our neon and argon matrix observations for Hg&#8722;O suggest a slightly ionic molecule. Spectra are also observed for Hg-O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Hg-O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercuric oxide is a well-known and stable solid, but the diatomic molecule Hg&#8722;O is very fragile and does not survive detection in the gas phase. However, laser ablation of Hg atoms from a dental amalgam alloy target into argon or neon containing about 0.3&#8201;% of &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or of &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; during their condensation into a cryogenic matrix at 4&#8197;K allows the formation of O atoms which react on annealing to make ozone and new IR absorptions in solid argon at 521.2&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for Hg-&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O or at 496.4&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for Hg-&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O with the oxygen isotopic frequency ratio 521.2/496.4=1.0499. Solid neon gives a 529.0&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; absorption with a small 7.8&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; blue shift. CCSD(T) calculations found 594&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for Hg&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O and 562&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for Hg&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O (frequency ratio=1.0569).

         <title>Theoretical Exploration on the Role of Magnetic States to the N2 Fixation behaviors of 2D Transition Metal Tri&#8208;borides (TMB3s)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 7, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic states affect the adsorption of intermediates. A key discovery is TMB3s, which are highly intrinsic active, stable, and have a large number of active sites for intrinsic electrocatalysis. More importantly, the role of TMBs in NRR with rich magnetic states is investigated. Among them, different magnetic states have different adsorption strengths for NRR intermediates, while there is no effect on the activation of nitrogen, making TMB3 a catalyst for NRR that is magnetically stable.







Abstract
Fixing nitrogen (N2) by electrosynthesis method has become a promising way to ammonia (NH3) production, nevertheless, developing electrocatalysts combining long&#8208;term stable and low&#8208;cost feathers are still a great challenge to date. Using comprehensive first&#8208;principles calculations, we herein investigate the potential of a new class of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal tri&#8208;borides (TMB3s) as nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) electrocatalysts, and explore the effect of magnetic orders on the NRR. Our results show that the TMB3s can sufficiently activate N2 and convert it to NH3. Particularly, TiB3 is identified as a high&#8208;efficiency catalyst for NRR because of its low limiting potential (&#8722;0.24&#8197;V) and good suppression of the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). For the first time, we present that these TMB3s with various magnetic states exhibit different performances in the adsorption of N2 and NRR intermediates, and minor effect on activation of N2. Besides, VB3, CrB3, MnB3, and FeB3 monolayers possess the superior capacity to suppress surface oxidation via the self&#8208;activating process, which reduces *O/*OH into *H2O under NRR electrochemical conditions, thus favoring the N2 electroreduction. This work paves the way for finding high&#8208;performance NRR catalysts for transition metal borides and pioneering the research of magnetic states effects in NRR.

         <title>Molecular Twisting Affects the Solid&#8208;State Photochemical Reactions of Unsaturated Ketones and the Photomechanical Effects of Molecular Crystals</title>

The degree of the double&#8208;bond torsion in chalcones has a significant effect on the solid&#8208;state photo&#8208;chemical reactivity to tune the photomechanical effects of their crystals.







Abstract
Three groups of chalcone derivatives and their analogues involving halogen atoms (X=F, Cl, Br) have been synthesized. Firstly, the nearly planar acyclic chalcone derivatives were inclined to undergo photo&#8208;induced stereospecific [2+2] cycloaddition, which triggered the crystals to exhibit macroscopic motions of bending or cracking. In particular, the single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation happened upon UV irradiation of the crystals, which was helpful for the understanding photomechanical effects. Cyclic 3,4&#8208;dihydronaphthalene&#8208;based chalcone analogues possess a more twisted conformation, and they tend to undergo trans&#8208;cis isomerization. No photomechanical effect was observed for the crystals of the cyclic chalcone analogues due to the lower isomerization rate. The twist degree of chroman&#8208;based molecules was in between of the first two, [2+2] cycloaddition and trans&#8208;cis isomerization simultaneously took place in crystals. Photo&#8208;induced bending and twisting were observed for the crystals of chroman&#8208;based chalcone analogues. Therefore, the differences in molecular dihedral angles in &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones were responsible for their photochemical characters and in turn to tune the photomechanical effects. In this work, a bridge between the molecular structures and solid&#8208;state photochemical reactions triggered photomechanical crystals is built.

         <title>Phosphorescent Metal Halide Nanoclusters for Tunable Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 7, February 1, 2023. </description>

Phosphorescent metal halide nanoclusters have been described for tunable photodynamic therapy. Modulating the short chain fatty acid length on the apical halide ligand of phosphorescent octahedral molybdenum&#8208;based nanoclusters facilitates cellular uptake and improves phototoxicity in photodynamic therapy (PDT). Following photoexcitation, the nanoclusters produce singlet oxygen to cause cancer cell death. Image created with BioRender.com.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is currently limited by the inability of photosensitizers (PSs) to enter cancer cells and generate sufficient reactive oxygen species. Utilizing phosphorescent triplet states of novel PSs to generate singlet oxygen offers exciting possibilities for PDT. Here, we report phosphorescent octahedral molybdenum (Mo)&#8208;based nanoclusters (NC) with tunable toxicity for PDT of cancer cells without use of rare or toxic elements. Upon irradiation with blue light, these molecules are excited to their singlet state and then undergo intersystem crossing to their triplet state. These NCs display surprising tunability between their cellular cytotoxicity and phototoxicity by modulating the apical halide ligand with a series of short chain fatty acids from trifluoroacetate to heptafluorobutyrate. The NCs are effective in PDT against breast, skin, pancreas, and colon cancer cells as well as their highly metastatic derivatives, demonstrating the robustness of these NCs in treating a wide variety of aggressive cancer cells. Furthermore, these NCs are internalized by cancer cells, remain in the lysosome, and can be modulated by the apical ligand to produce singlet oxygen. Thus, (Mo)&#8208;based nanoclusters are an excellent platform for optimizing PSs. Our results highlight the profound impact of molecular nanocluster chemistry in PDT applications.

         <title>Separation of Tellurium from Metal Chalcogenides through Mild Anhydrous Chlorination</title>

Photovoltaic waste: The separation of tellurium from cadmium telluride is examined using a unique combination of mild, anhydrous chlorination and complexation with 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcatechol. This procedure also proved to give a significant separation of sulfur, selenium, and tellurium from a complex mixture of metal chalcogenides.







Abstract
The separation of tellurium from cadmium telluride is examined using a unique combination of mild, anhydrous chlorination and complexation of the subsequent tellurium tetrachloride with 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcatecholate ligands (dtbc). The resulting tellurium complex, Te(dtbc)2, is isolated in moderate yield and features a 103 to 104 reduction in cadmium content, as provided by XRF and ICP&#8208;MS analysis. Similar results were obtained from zinc telluride. A significant separation between Te, Se, and S was observed after treating a complex mixture of metal chalcogenides with this protocol.

     alt="Separation of Tellurium from Metal Chalcogenides through Mild Anhydrous Chlorination"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Photovoltaic waste&lt;/b&gt;: The separation of tellurium from cadmium telluride is examined using a unique combination of mild, anhydrous chlorination and complexation with 3,5-di-tert-butylcatechol. This procedure also proved to give a significant separation of sulfur, selenium, and tellurium from a complex mixture of metal chalcogenides.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The separation of tellurium from cadmium telluride is examined using a unique combination of mild, anhydrous chlorination and complexation of the subsequent tellurium tetrachloride with 3,5-di-&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butylcatecholate ligands (dtbc). The resulting tellurium complex, Te(dtbc)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, is isolated in moderate yield and features a 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; reduction in cadmium content, as provided by XRF and ICP-MS analysis. Similar results were obtained from zinc telluride. A significant separation between Te, Se, and S was observed after treating a complex mixture of metal chalcogenides with this protocol. These three tunable steps can be applied for future applications of CdTe photovoltaic waste.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Br&#248;nsted Acid/Base Site Isolated in a Pentanuclear Scaffold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 7, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the traditional framework of acid&#8208;base chemistry, H+ always locates at a position that can provide a thermodynamically stable state. Here, we report the first example of H+ that exists in its thermodynamically metastable state using steric isolation of Br&#248;nsted acid/base sites within a heterometallic multinuclear complex. The current study offers a novel strategy for controlling the location of H+ within materials.







Abstract
The concept of Br&#248;nsted&#8208;Lowry acids and bases is long and widely recognized as the most reasonable theory to explain the behavior of H+ ions. Here, we report a Br&#248;nsted acid/base pair that does not follow this theory. Two heteronuclear metal complexes, in which Br&#248;nsted acid/base sites are sterically isolated, were synthesized and characterized. These sterically isolated sites exhibited anomalous behavior, wherein the H+ species encapsulated in the Br&#248;nsted acid site did not undergo a deprotonation reaction, and the corresponding protonation reaction at the Br&#248;nsted base site failed to proceed. As a result, two states that are in a relationship of a Br&#248;nsted acid/base pair stably exist over a wide pH range without any interconversion, generating a thermodynamically metastable state. Additionally, these two states exhibited distinct electron transfer abilities and reactivities. The system presented in this study is in sharp contrast with the traditional concept of Br&#248;nsted&#8211;Lowry acids and bases.

A competitive evaluation of the DalPhos ligand family in nickel&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N cross&#8208;couplings involving a diverse set of test nucleophiles, electrophiles, solvents, and bases enabled the development of the first metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N cross&#8208;couplings of aminopyrazoles and related heteroatom&#8208;dense nucleophiles with (hetero)aryl chlorides using an amine &#8216;dual&#8208;base&#8217; system.







Abstract
A systematic competitive evaluation of the DalPhos ligand family in nickel&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;arylation chemistry is reported, involving primary (linear and branched) and secondary alkylamines, as well as a primary five&#8208;membered heteroarylamine (aminopyrazole), in combination with a diverse set of test electrophiles and bases (NaOtBu, K2CO3, DBU/NaTFA). In addition to providing optimal ligand/catalyst identification, and bringing to light methodology limitations (e.&#8201;g., unwanted C&#8722;O cross&#8208;coupling with NaOtBu), our survey enabled the development of the first efficient catalyst system for heteroatom&#8208;dense C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling of aminopyrazoles and related nucleophiles with (hetero)aryl chlorides by use of an amine &#8216;dual&#8208;base&#8217; system.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Ligand Cooperativity in MnI&#8208;Catalysed N&#8208;Formylation of Secondary Amides and Lactams Using CO2 at Room Temperature</title>

         <dc:description>
A MnI complex coordinated with a redox non&#8208;innocent phenalenyl (PLY) ligand is reported for catalytic N&#8208;formylation of secondary amides (including late&#8208;stage diversification of pharmaceutics) and lactams with CO2 as C1 source at room temperature for the first time. A combined approach of experimental analysis and DFT calculations sketch the plausible radical&#8208;mediated pathway of an unconventional metal&#8208;ligand cooperation, involving a ligand&#8208;centred radical.







Abstract
A MnI catalyst featuring redox&#8208;active tridentate phenalenyl (PLY) ligand has been used for catalytic N&#8208;formylation of secondary amides and lactams under 1&#8197;atm CO2 as a C1 source at room temperature for the first time. The protocol is applicable to a wide range of secondary amides including heterocycles, bio&#8208;active cinnamide derivatives and the diversification of therapeutic molecules. In&#8208;depth mechanistic investigations based on experimental outcomes and DFT calculations suggested an unconventional metal&#8208;ligand cooperation, where a ligand&#8208;centred radical plays a crucial role in initiating the reaction process.

         <title>Enantiomeric Resolution and Enantiomer Isolation of H2TPPS4&#8197;J&#8208;Aggregate from Aqueous Solution Is Enabled by Vortexes</title>

The asymmetric vortices induce the selective deposition of J&#8208;aggregates from a corresponding racemic mixture allowing to isolate and recover the single J&#8208;aggregate enantiomer separated.







Abstract
Protonated achiral H2TPPS4 spontaneously self&#8208;arranges at acids pH and high ionic strength to build mesoscopic J&#8208;aggregates that are intrinsically chiral. According to the symmetry rule aggregation leads to a racemate that, however, can be unbalanced by chemical (chiral pollutants) or physical stimuli (as vortexing the solution). Vortexing the title racemate, in principle, might either induce chiral separation or chiral enrichment. Indeed, herein it is shown that vortices enable the resolution of this racemic solution exploiting the tendency to deposit, onto the quartz cuvette walls, of the enantiomer favored by the stirring sense. Simultaneously, over time, it was found that the opposite chiral conformation becomes prevalent in solution realizing a significant enantiomeric resolution. Therefore, after removing all stirring&#8208;favored chiral J&#8208;aggregate from the solution, the recovering and isolating of the desired enantiomers from the cuvette walls was successfully obtained without complex procedures. In this sense, it has been demonstrated that the stirring forces are executively able to fulfil the chiral separation in H2TPPS4 J&#8208;aggregates, employed as model of a self&#8208;assembled system in aqueous solution.

         <title>Sequential C&#8722;H Methylation Catalyzed by the B12&#8208;Dependent SAM Enzyme TokK: Comprehensive Theoretical Study of Selectivities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 7, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a B12&#8208;dependent radical SAM enzyme, TokK catalyzes consecutive methylation reactions on a pantetheinylated carbapenem substrate. A stepwise &#8220;push&#8211;pull&#8221; radical transfer mechanism is proposed for each methylation: a 5&#8217;&#8208;deoxyadenosine radical first abstracts a hydrogen atom from the substrate, then methylcobalamin donates a methyl group to the substrate. The calculations can uncover the origin of the observed chemoselectivity, stereoselectivity, and regioselectivity.







Abstract
TokK is a B12&#8208;dependent radical SAM enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of the &#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotic asparenomycin&#8197;A. It can catalyze three methylations on different sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon positions to introduce an isopropyl side chain at the &#946;&#8208;lactam ring of pantetheinylated carbapenem. Herein, we report a quantum chemical study of the reaction mechanism of TokK. A stepwise &#8216;&#8216;push&#8208;pull&#8217;&#8217; radical relay mechanism is proposed for each methylation: a 5&#8217;&#8208;deoxyadenosine radical first abstracts a hydrogen atom from the substrate in the active site, then methylcobalamin directionally donates a methyl group to the substrate. More importantly, calculations were able to uncover the origin of observed chemoselectivity and stereoselectivity for the first methylation and regioselectivity for the following two methylations. Further detailed distortion/interaction analysis can help to unravel the main factors controlling the selectivities. Our findings of sequential methylations by TokK could have profound implications for studying other B12&#8208;dependent radical SAM enzymes.

         <title>Synthesis and Physical Properties of Tunable Aryl Alkyl Ionic Liquids (TAAILs) Comprising Imidazolium Cations Blocked with Methyl&#8208;, Propyl&#8208; and Phenyl&#8208;Groups at the C2 Position</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 7, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Blocking the C2 position of imidazolium&#8208;based tunable aryl alkyl ionic liquids (TAAILs) with methyl, propyl and phenyl groups has a strong influence on their physicochemical properties like viscosity and conductivity. Especially the electrochemical window can be enlarged. Electron&#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing substituents on the aryl ring could further change the electron density which has also been analyzed by quantum chemical DFT calculations.







Abstract
Imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquids are very popular for different applications because of their low viscosity and melting point. However, the hydrogen atom at the C2 position of the imidazolium cation can easily be deprotonated by a base, resulting in a reactive carbene. If an inert ionic liquid is needed, it is necessary to introduce an unreactive alkyl or aryl group at the C2 position to prevent deprotonation. Tunable aryl alkyl ionic liquids (TAAILs) were first introduced by our group in 2009 and are characterized by a phenyl group at the N1 position, which offers the possibility to fine&#8208;tune the physicochemical properties by using different electron&#8208;donating or &#8208;withdrawing substituents. In this work, we present a new series of TAAILs where the C2 position is blocked by a methyl, propyl or phenyl group. For each of the blocking groups, the phenyl and three different phenyl derivatives (2&#8208;Me, 4&#8208;OMe, 2,4&#8208;F2) are compared with respect to melting point, viscosity, conductivity and electrochemical window. In addition, the differences between blocked and unblocked TAAILs with regard to their electrochemical reduction potentials are investigated by quantum chemical methods.

         <title>Promoted Photothermal Catalytic CO Hydrogenation by Using TiC&#8208;Supported Co&#8722;Fe5C2 Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 7, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co&#8208;Fe5C2/TiC catalysts absorb light from the visible to near&#8208;infrared regions for efficient photo&#8208;to&#8208;thermal conversion. Plasmonic hot&#8208;electron injection from TiC to Fe5C2 further modulates the chemical states of Fe on the Fe5C2 surfaces, enabling a 7.2&#8208;fold increase in C2+ yield in photothermal CO hydrogenation.







Abstract
Photothermal catalytic CO hydrogenation offers the potential to synthesize light hydrocarbons by using solar energy. However, the selectivity and activity of the reaction are still far below those achieved in conventional thermal catalytic processes. Herein, we report that the Co&#8208;modified Fe5C2 on TiC catalyst promotes photothermal catalytic CO hydrogenation with a 59&#8201;% C2+ selectivity in the produced hydrocarbons and a 30&#8201;% single&#8208;pass CO conversion at a high gas hourly space&#8211;time velocity of 12&#8201;000&#8197;mL&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Using in&#8208;situ&#8208;irradiated XPS, we show that light&#8208;induced hot electron injection from TiC to Fe5C2 modulates the chemical state of Fe, thereby increasing the CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion. This work suggests that it is possible for plasmon&#8208;mediated surface chemistry to enhance the activity and selectivity of photothermal catalytic reactions.

         <title>Modifying the St&#246;ber Process: Is the Organic Solvent Indispensable?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 7, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic solvents are not indispensable in the St&#246;ber method and its extensions. Ethanol produced from the hydrolysis of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) already makes the reactants miscible and completes the synthesis. A simple organic solvent&#8208;free alternative to the St&#246;ber process enables the synthesis of controllable uniform silica spheres and has the potential to be extended to other St&#246;ber process&#8208;based material syntheses.







Abstract
The St&#246;ber method is one of the most important and fundamental processes for the synthesis of inorganic (nano)materials but has the drawback of using a large amount of organic solvent. Herein, ethanol was used as an example to explore if the organic solvent in a typical St&#246;ber method can be omitted. It was found that ethanol increases the particle size of the obtained silica spheres and aids the formation of uniform silica particles rather than forming a gel. Nevertheless, the results indicated that an organic solvent in the initial synthesis mixture is not indispensable. An initially immiscible synthesis method was discovered, which can replace the organic solvent&#8208;based St&#246;ber method to successfully synthesize silica particles with the same size ranges as the original St&#246;ber process without addition of organic solvents. Moreover, this process can be of further value for the extension to synthesis processes of other materials based on the St&#246;ber process.

         <title>How Bases Catalyze Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 7, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
All about that base! Our quantum chemical activation strain analyses reveal how bases can effectively catalyze the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction by promoting both the normal electron demand orbital interactions and electrostatic interactions. This study demonstrates the underlying mechanistic differences between the base&#8208;catalyzed and Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed Diels&#8208;Alder reactions.







Abstract
We have quantum chemically studied the base&#8208;catalyzed Diels&#8208;Alder (DA) reaction between 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;pyrone and N&#8208;methylmaleimide using dispersion&#8208;corrected density functional theory. The uncatalyzed reaction is slow and is preceded by the extrusion of CO2 via a retro&#8208;DA reaction. Base catalysis, for example, by triethylamine, lowers the reaction barrier up to 10&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, causing the reaction to proceed smoothly at low temperature, which quenches the expulsion of CO2, yielding efficient access to polyoxygenated natural compounds. Our activation strain analyses reveal that the base accelerates the DA reaction via two distinct electronic mechanisms: i) by the HOMO&#8208;raising effect, which enhances the normal electron demand orbital interaction; and ii) by donating charge into 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;pyrone which accumulates in its reactive region and promotes strongly stabilizing secondary electrostatic interactions with N&#8208;methylmaleimide.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have quantum chemically studied the base-catalyzed Diels-Alder (DA) reaction between 3-hydroxy-2-pyrone and N-methylmaleimide using dispersion-corrected density functional theory. The uncatalyzed reaction is slow and is preceded by the extrusion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; via a retro-DA reaction. Base catalysis, for example, by triethylamine, lowers the reaction barrier up to 10&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, causing the reaction to proceed smoothly at low temperature, which quenches the expulsion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, yielding efficient access to polyoxygenated natural compounds. Our activation strain analyses reveal that the base accelerates the DA reaction via two distinct electronic mechanisms: i) by the &lt;i&gt;HOMO-raising&lt;/i&gt; effect, which enhances the normal electron demand orbital interaction; and ii) by donating charge into 3-hydroxy-2-pyrone which accumulates in its reactive region and promotes strongly stabilizing secondary electrostatic interactions with N-methylmaleimide.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Luminescent Crystalline Carbon&#8208; and Nitrogen&#8208;Centered Organic Radicals Based on N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Triphenylamine Hybrids (Han et&#8197;al.)







Abstract
Developing luminescent radicals with tunable emission is a challenging task due to the limitation of alternative skeletons. Herein, a series of carbene&#8208;triphenylamine hybrids were prepared by the direct C2&#8208;arylation of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes with 4&#8208;bromo&#8208;N,N&#8208;bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)aniline. These hybrids showed multiple redox&#8208;active properties and could be converted to carbon&#8208;centered luminescent radicals with blue&#8208;to&#8208;cyan emissions (&#955;max: 436&#8211;486&#8197;nm) or nitrogen&#8208;centered luminescent radicals with orange emissions (&#955;max: 590&#8211;623&#8197;nm) through chemical reduction or oxidation, respectively. The radical species were characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, ultraviolet&#8208;visible spectroscopy, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractometry analysis. Notably, the corresponding nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals exhibited good stability in atmospheric air, and their thermal decomposition temperatures were determined to be above 200&#8201;&#176;C. In addition, spectral and theoretical calculations indicate that all radicals exhibit anti&#8208;Kasha emissions.

         <title>Placing CF2 in the Center: Major Physicochemical Changes Upon a Minor Structural Alteration in Gem&#8208;Difunctional Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 7, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large increase in lipophilicity is observed for CH2/CF2 replacement in the center of di&#8208;functional compounds. The increase, in the range of 0.6&#8211;1.4&#8197;units is for most cases, far above expected values. The effect is nearly additive, thus one can switch from a hydrophilic compound to a lipophilic one using a limited number of H/F exchanges. In this paper, the effect and its origins are explored.







Abstract
Fluorine atoms play an important role in all branches of chemistry and accordingly, it is very important to study their unique and varied effects systematically, in particular, the structure&#8208;physicochemical properties relationship. The present study describes exceptional physicochemical effects resulting from a H/F exchange at the methylene bridge of gem&#8208;difunctional compounds. The &#916;log P(CF2&#8208;CH2) values, that is, the change in lipophilicity, observed for the CH2/CF2 replacement in various &#945;,&#945;&#8208;phenoxy&#8208; and thiophenoxy&#8208;esters/amides, diketones, benzodioxoles and more, fall in the range of 0.6&#8211;1.4&#8197;units, which for most cases, is far above the values expected for such a replacement. Moreover, for compounds holding more than one such gem&#8208;difunctional moiety, the effect is nearly additive, so one can switch from a hydrophilic compound to a lipophilic one in a limited number of H/F exchanges. DFT studies of some of these systems revealed that polarity, conformational preference as well as charge distributions are strongly affected by such hydrogen to fluorine atom substitution. The pronounced effects described, are a result of the interplay between changes in polarity, H&#8208;bond basicity and molecular volume, which were obtained with a very low &#8216;cost&#8217; in terms of molecular weight or steric effects and may have a great potential for implementation in various fields of chemical sciences.

         <title>Frontispiece: Enantioselective C&#8722;H Bond Functionalization Involving Arene Ruthenium(II) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 7, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
While p&#8208;cymene ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation has achieved tremendous success in the last two decades, the corresponding enantioselective variant has not been realized until recently and is still in its infancy. In this minireview five strategies to enable arene ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H activation are summarized: by intramolecular nitrene C&#8722;H insertion, chiral transient directing group, chiral carboxylic acid, relay catalysis, and chiral arene ligands. For more details, see the Review by H. Liang and J. Wang (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202461).

         <dc:description>
The copper enzymes Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) may facilitate the upcycling of biomass waste products by boosting the breakdown of cellulose and other recalcitrant polysaccharides. The LPMOs work through a catalytic, oxidative reaction whose mechanism is still controversial. Here we review theoretical investigations of the LPMO reaction mechanism. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the employed theoretical methods and comment on the interplay between theoretical and experimental results.

H+ that exists in its thermodynamically metastable state is reported. The key to success was to employ a metal&#8208;complex&#8208;based scaffold with a small cavity within its structure. By sterically isolating Br&#248;nsted acid/base sites, anomalous behaviors of H+ were observed. In addition, the unique physical and chemical properties of the isolated sites were clarified. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Masaoka and co&#8208;workers. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203253).

Driven by renewable solar energy, photocatalytic CO hydrogenation offers a promising way to synthesize valuable hydrocarbon chemicals. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202891), M. Zhong and co&#8208;workers show that an efficient photochemical and photothermal synergy between the nearby catalytic and plasmonic centers can accelerate the reaction. By using Co&#8722;Fe5C2 on a TiC photocatalyst, a 59&#8201;% C2+ selectivity and a 30&#8201;% CO conversion were obtained at the high GHSV of 12&#8201;000&#8197;mL&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1.

         <title>Molecular Mechanism of Substrate Oxidation in Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygenases: Insight from Theoretical Investigations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 7, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMO) are copper dependent enzymes that boost the breakdown of cellulose and other recalcitrant polysaccharides through a catalytic, oxidative reaction. However, the exact mechanism and the true nature of the co&#8208;substrate remain controversial. Herein theoretical investigations of the mechanism with substrate are reviewed and advantages and disadvantages of the employed methods are discussed.







Abstract
Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are copper enzymes that today comprise a large enzyme superfamily, grouped into the distinct members AA9&#8211;AA17 (with AA12 exempted). The LPMOs have the potential to facilitate the upcycling of biomass waste products by boosting the breakdown of cellulose and other recalcitrant polysaccharides. The cellulose biopolymer is the main component of biomass waste and thus comprises a large, unexploited resource. The LPMOs work through a catalytic, oxidative reaction whose mechanism is still controversial. For instance, the nature of the intermediate performing the oxidative reaction is an open question, and the same holds for the employed co&#8208;substrate. Here we review theoretical investigations addressing these questions. The applied theoretical methods are usually based on quantum mechanics (QM), often combined with molecular mechanics (QM/MM). We discuss advantages and disadvantages of the employed theoretical methods and comment on the interplay between theoretical and experimental results.

         <title>Live Monitoring of Anionic Living Polymerizations by Electrospray&#8208;Ionization Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perusing polymerization: Electrospray&#8208;ionization mass spectrometry permits the in&#8208;situ monitoring of living anionic polymerizations. Analysis of the time evolution of the observed molar mass distributions affords rate constants for the individual propagation steps and gives unique insight into the mechanism of the polymerization reaction.







Abstract
Anionic polymerizations are of exceptional practical importance, but difficult to analyze due to the high reactivity of the growing polymer chains. Here, we demonstrate that electrospray&#8208;ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) permits direct observation of the active carbanionic intermediates formed in the anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization of 1&#8208;cyanocyclopropanecarboxylate in tetrahydrofuran. This includes the identification of a side product, as well as real&#8208;time analysis of the polymerization reaction. From the mass spectra obtained, we can derive not only the mean molar mass and the polydispersity, but also the rate constants for the initiation and the individual propagation steps. The initiation proceeds significantly faster than the propagation steps. Accordingly, the examined reaction corresponds to a living polymerization, as we also confirmed by additional control experiments. Besides giving detailed insight into the reaction system probed here, we also expect the presented methodology to make possible the in&#8208;situ analysis of further anionic polymerizations.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Perusing polymerization&lt;/b&gt;: Electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry permits the in-situ monitoring of living anionic polymerizations. Analysis of the time evolution of the observed molar mass distributions affords rate constants for the individual propagation steps and gives unique insight into the mechanism of the polymerization reaction.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anionic polymerizations are of exceptional practical importance, but difficult to analyze due to the high reactivity of the growing polymer chains. Here, we demonstrate that electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) permits direct observation of the active carbanionic intermediates formed in the anionic ring-opening polymerization of 1-cyanocyclopropanecarboxylate in tetrahydrofuran. This includes the identification of a side product, as well as real-time analysis of the polymerization reaction. From the mass spectra obtained, we can derive not only the mean molar mass and the polydispersity, but also the rate constants for the initiation and the individual propagation steps. The initiation proceeds significantly faster than the propagation steps. Accordingly, the examined reaction corresponds to a living polymerization, as we also confirmed by additional control experiments. Besides giving detailed insight into the reaction system probed here, we also expect the presented methodology to make possible the in-situ analysis of further anionic polymerizations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>IR/UV Double Resonance Study of the 2&#8208;Phenylallyl Radical and its Pyrolysis Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The contribution of the resonance&#8208;stabilized 2&#8208;phenylallyl radical (2&#8208;PA) to molecular growth in a high temperature microreactor is reported in this work. The radical as well as several reaction products were identified by IR/UV ion dip spectroscopy based on their gas&#8208;phase IR signatures, showing that uni&#8208; and bimolecular reactions of 2&#8208;PA are a viable source for PAH formation.







Abstract
Isolated 2&#8208;phenylallyl radicals (2&#8208;PA), generated by pyrolysis from a nitrite precursor, have been investigated by IR/UV ion dip spectroscopy using free electron laser radiation. 2&#8208;PA is a resonance&#8208;stabilized radical that is considered to be involved in the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in combustion, but also in interstellar space. The radical is identified based on its gas&#8208;phase IR spectrum. Furthermore, a number of bimolecular reaction products are identified, showing that the self&#8208;reaction as well as reactions with unimolecular decomposition products of 2&#8208;PA form several PAH efficiently. Possible mechanisms are discussed and the chemistry of 2&#8208;PA is compared with the one of the related 2&#8208;methylallyl and phenylpropargyl radicals.

         <title>A Modular Olefination of Aldehydes with Thiols as Coupling Partners</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and modular protocol for the olefination of aldehydes with thiols as reaction partners is reported. Olefins with both aromatic and aliphatic substituents were synthesized in high yields and good selectivity via unsymmetric bissulfone intermediates. The E/Z&#8208;selectivity could be switched under kinetic control through the choice of solvent. The use of simple, transition metal&#8208;free reaction conditions and the breadth of substitution patterns that can be accessed render this protocol an attractive addition to the methods available for the de&#8208;novo synthesis of olefins.







Abstract
Olefins range amongst the most important motifs in organic chemistry. Hence, the development of novel olefin syntheses has remained a constant field of research in synthetic chemistry to date. Herein, we report the development of a modular olefination that converts aldehydes into olefins with thiols as reaction partners. The simple, transition metal&#8208;free protocol proceeds via an unsymmetrical bissulfone intermediate which is converted into the respective alkene in a Ramberg&#8208;B&#228;cklund&#8208;type process. Differently substituted olefins can be synthesized from readily available starting materials in typically good yields and stereoselectivities using basic laboratory chemicals exclusively. Complementary reaction conditions differing in the choice of solvent favor the E/Z&#8208;products respectively under kinetic control rendering this protocol an interesting economical addition to the family of olefin syntheses.

         <title>POM@ZIF Derived Mixed Metal Oxide Catalysts for Sustained Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile chemical route to convert POM&#8208;doped ZIF 67 to carbon&#8208;supported mixed metal oxides gives access to a noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free OER catalyst featuring high specific surface area, high stability, and high OER activity.







Abstract
The design of efficient and stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts based on noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free materials is crucial for energy conversion and storage. In this work, it was demonstrated how polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;67 can be converted into a stable oxygen evolution electrocatalyst by chemical etching, cation exchange, and thermal annealing steps. Characterization by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy indicate that POM&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;67 derived carbon&#8208;supported metal oxides were synthesized. The resulting composite shows structural and compositional advantages which lead to low overpotential (306&#8197;mV at j=10&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and long&#8208;term stability under harsh OER conditions (1.0&#8197;M aqueous KOH).

Simultaneous Pore Space Partition and Multi&#8208;Step Core Expansion: An integration of core&#8208;expansion and pore&#8208;space partition strategies leads to simultaneous increase in C2H2 uptake capacity and C2H2/CO2 selectivity.







Abstract
A multi&#8208;stage core&#8208;expansion method is proposed here as one component of the integrative binding&#8208;site/extender/core&#8208;expansion (BEC) strategy. The conceptual deconstruction of the partitioning ligand into three editable parts draws our focus onto progressive core expansion and allows the optimization of both acetylene uptake and selectivity. The effectiveness of this strategy is shown through a family of eight cationic pore&#8208;partitioned materials containing three different partitioning ligands and various counter anions. The optimized structure, Co3&#8208;cpt&#8208;tph&#8208;Cl (Hcpt=4&#8208;(p&#8208;carboxyphenyl)&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole, H&#8208;tph=(2,5,8&#8208;tri&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3,4,6,7,9&#8208;hexaazaphenalene) with the largest surface area and highest C2H2 uptake capacity (200&#8197;cm3/g at 298&#8197;K), also exhibits (desirably) the lowest CO2 uptake and hence the highest C2H2/CO2 selectivity. The successful boost in both C2H2 capacity and IAST selectivity allows Co3&#8208;cpt&#8208;tph&#8208;Cl to rank among the best crystalline porous materials, ionic MOFs in particular, for C2H2 uptake and C2H2/CO2 experimental breakthrough separation.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hypervalent iodine&#8208;based aminating reagents containing a transferable (diarylmethylene)amino group can be used for the &#945;&#8208;amination of simple carbonyl compounds such as esters, amides, and ketones in the presence of a lithium base. A snapshot of the unique coupling of an &#945;&#8208;carbonyl radical with an iminyl radical in this amination is given by the motif of spacecraft docking with a space station.

     alt="&#945;-Amination of Carbonyl Compounds by Using Hypervalent Iodine-Based Aminating Reagents Containing a Transferable (Diarylmethylene)amino Group"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hypervalent iodine-based aminating reagents&lt;/b&gt; containing a transferable (diarylmethylene)amino group can be used for the &#945;-amination of simple carbonyl compounds such as esters, amides, and ketones in the presence of a lithium base. A snapshot of the unique coupling of an &#945;-carbonyl radical with an iminyl radical in this amination is given by the motif of spacecraft docking with a space station.

         <title>The Effect of Mesogenic Coronas on the Type and Anisotropy of Gold Nanoparticle Superlattices: When Can the Tail Wag the Dog?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold nanoparticles are giants compared to the ligands grafted to their surfaces. The particles weigh several hundred kDa, an organic ligand just 1&#8197;kDa. Yet by designing the shape of these small ligands, particularly the length and number of their alkyl tails, they can direct the gold nanoparticles to assemble in a large variety of superlattices. In the Research Article by G.&#8197;H. Mehl, F. Liu, G. Ungar, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203673), it is shown by several examples and by detailed geometric analysis how the &#8220;tail can wag the dog&#8221;.

         <title>Chiroptical Activity of An Achiral Emissive Eu Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An achiral Eu&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework and its chiroptical properties both in the ground and excited states. The framework crystallizes in an achiral space ground (Pna21) belonging to the polar point group (mm2). A pair of circular dichroisms (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) peaks with opposite signs were observed for single crystals.







Abstract
Chiroptical activity of achiral crystals is theoretically allowed but very unusual. There is a particularly scarcity of empirical studies on optically active achiral metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). Herein we report an achiral emissive Eu MOF and its chiroptical properties both in the ground and excited states. The framework crystallizes in an achiral space group (Pna21) belonging to the polar point group (mm2), where the asymmetric arrangement of racemic trinuclear Eu&#8208;oxo clusters is responsible for the optical activity. A pair of circular dichroisms (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) peaks with opposite signs were observed for single crystals. Importantly, the luminescence dissymmetry factor can reach up to 1.1&#215;10&#8722;3, which is comparable in magnitude to the value of most of the chiral&#8208;linker&#8208;bridged MOFs. This work gives the first example of achiral MOFs with CPL response and should be instructive for the discovery of more CPL emitters from racemic MOF family.

         <title>Preparation, Structure&#8208;Performance Relationship, and Reaction Network of ZnZSM&#8208;5 for Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethane with CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ethylene (C2H4) is a major chemical for the modern society, and new technologies for its production are of strategic importance globally. Recently, oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (C2H6) using CO2 as a milder oxidant (CO2&#8208;ODH) is proposed as a potential way for C2H4 production, and development of effective catalysts for the process is drawing wide attentions. Here, we report on a facilely prepared ZSM&#8208;5 supported Zn system, i.e. ZnZSM&#8208;5, which showed great promise in CO2&#8208;ODH. Samples with different Zn loadings were prepared and evaluated, and the highest performance was obtained over 0.05ZnZSM&#8208;5 at 700 oC and a CO2:C2H6 feeding ratio of 5:1. During 340 min TOS, the C2H6 conversion decreased moderately from 36.2 to 23.1%, and the C2H4 yield stabilized at 21.9 to 27.9%. Based on systematic characterization and investigation of reaction conditions, the structure&#8208;performance relationship and reaction network were discussed in detail.</dc:description>

         <title>Atroposelective Nenitzescu Indole Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the past decade, compounds bearing a stereogenic C&#8211; N axis have gained significant attention ranging from ligand to drug design. Yet, the atroposelective synthesis of these molecules remains a considerable challenge. In contrast to recent methods utilizing more advanced chiral catalysts, a most simply accessed Jacobsen&#8208;type Chromium(III)&#8208;salen complex was herein utilized as chiral enantiopure Lewis acid catalyst for a highly atroposelective Nenitzescu indole synthesis. Mild reaction conditions afforded various 5&#8208;Hydroxybenzo[g]indoles with up to 97% yield. Moreover, through a simple work&#8208;up, very high enantiomeric excesses of up to 99% could be obtained.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The compound Ge32Co9&#8722;x (x&#160;=&#160;0.54(6), a&#160;=&#160;10.9861(3) &#197;, space group Im&#8208;3m) was prepared by high&#8208;pressure at high&#8208;temperature and is metastable at ambient conditions. It crystallizes in a new structure type, Pearson symbol cI82&#8208;1.08. The crystal structure represents a slightly distorted cubic primitive arrangement of germanium atoms with part of the Ge cubes filled by cobalt. Analysis of the chemical bonding by real space methods reveals three&#8208;core cluster units Ge16Co3 and seemingly empty regions comprising either covalent inter&#8208;polyhedral Ge&#8208;Ge bonds or lone&#8208;pairs located at the germanium atoms.

         <title>Introducing Aliphatic Fluoropeptides: Perspectives on Folding Properties, Membrane Partition and Proteolytic Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A de novo designed class of peptide&#8208;based fluoropolymers composed of fluorinated aliphatic amino acids as main components is reported. Structural characterization provided insights into fluorine&#8208;induced alterations on &#946;&#8208;strand to &#945;&#8208;helix transition upon an increase in SDS content and revealed the unique formation of PPII structures for trifluorinated fluoropeptides. A combination of circular dichroism, fluorescence&#8208;based leaking assays and surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy served to examine the insertion and folding processes into unilamellar vesicles. While partitioning into lipid bilayers, the degree of fluorination conducts a decrease in &#945;&#8208;helical content. Furthermore, this study comprises a report on the proteolytic stability of peptides exclusively built up by fluorinated amino acids and proved all sequences to be enzymatically degradable despite the degree of fluorination. Herein presented fluoropeptides as well as the distinctive properties of these artificial and polyfluorinated foldamers with enzyme&#8208;degradable features will play a crucial role in the future development of fluorinated peptide&#8208;based biomaterials</dc:description>

This gave stable magnesium ketyl complexes which are monomeric, [(ArNacnac)(DMAP)Mg(fluor&#183;)] (Ar = Mes or Dip, DMAP = 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine) and [(MesNacnac)Mg(xanth&#183;)(xanth)]; dimeric, [{(MesNacnac)Mg(&#956;&#8208;fluor&#183;)}2], or tetrameric, [{(DipNacnac)Mg(&#956;&#8208;anth&#183;)}4]. In contrast, di&#8208;2&#8208;pyridylketone (OCPy2) is doubly reduced with [{(XylNacnac)Mg}2] (Xyl = xylyl) to give a diamagnetic alkoxy/amido complex, [{(XylNacnac)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;OCPy2)]. These complexes have been characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, and in three cases, EPR spectroscopy. Regioselective C&#8210;C hetero&#8208;coupling reactions between magnesium ketyls and phenanthroline (phen) have yielded the alkoxy compounds, [(MesNacnac)Mg(OCR2&#8208;2&#8208;phen)] (OCR2 = xanth, OCPh2 or OC(Ph)(2&#8208;Me&#8208;Ph)). In addition, homo&#8208; C&#8208;C couplings of the enones, chalcone (chalc) and dibenziylideneactetone (DBA), using magnesium(I) reducing agents, have afforded dimagnesium enolates, [{(ArNacnac)(THF)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;chalc2)] (Ar = Mes or Xyl) and [{(DipNacnac)(THF)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;DBA2)]. A pinacol coupling reaction between [{(DipNacnac)Mg}2] and 2&#8208;adamantanone (OAd) yielded [{(DipNacnac)(OAd)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;OAd2)], presumably via a ketyl intermediate. This study further highlights the utility magnesium(I) compounds have as selective reducing agents in organic transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating the Antifreeze Activity through Water: Latent Functions of Sugars of Antifreeze Glycoprotein Revealed by Using Total Chemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antifreeze glycoprotein (AFGP), which inhibits the freezing of water, is highly O&#8208;glycosylated with a disaccharide,&#160;D&#8208;Gal&#946;1&#8208;3&#8208;D&#8208;GalNAc&#945; (GalGalNAc). To elucidate the function of the sugar residues for antifreeze activity at the molecular level, we conducted a total chemical synthesis of partially sugar deleted AFGP derivatives, and&#160;unnatural forms of&#160;AFGPs incorporating glucose (Glc)&#8208;type sugars instead of galactose (Gal)&#8208;type sugars. These elaborated AFGP derivatives demonstrated that the stereochemistry of each sugar residues on AFGPs precisely correlates with the antifreeze activity. A hydrogen&#8211;deuterium exchange experiment using synthetic AFGPs revealed a different dynamic behaviour of water around sugar residues depending on the sugar structures. These results indicate that sugar residues on AFGP form a unique dynamic water phase that disturbs the absorbance of water molecules onto the ice surface, thereby inhibiting freezing.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of 2D Imine&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks: From Linkage Chemistry to Interlayer Interaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stabilizing methodology: Emerging strategies, such as linkage transformation strategy, bond protection strategy, and interlayer interaction engineering, have recently been developed to regulate the stability of 2D imine&#8208;linked COFs. This provides a facile solution to the instability of imine&#8208;linked COFs while simultaneously conserving their structural crystallinity and functionality.







Abstract
Imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (imine&#8208;COFs) represent the most sought&#8208;after class of COFs due to their broad monomer scope and ease of synthesis. Owing to the reversible nature of imine linkages, however, the chemical stability of most imine&#8208;COFs is still far from adequate. In this context, emerging strategies, ranging from linkage chemistry to interlayer interaction, have been employed to construct stable imine&#8208;COFs for their applications in electronics, sensing, and energy storage devices. This Concept article summarizes the latest advances aimed at tuning the structural stability of imine&#8208;COFs. Furthermore, this Concept provides a prospective for the precise design of stable imine&#8208;COFs based on the characteristics of structure, physical properties, and chemical functions, as well as the mechanism of structure locking and stabilization during crystal growth.

         <title>A Simple Four&#8208;Step Synthesis of the Potato Alkaloid Demissidine from the Common Sapogenin Tigogenin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A simple synthesis method of solanidane alkaloids from common steroidal sapogenins was developed. Previously described multi&#8208;step transformations of tigogenin to demissidine (8&#8209;12 steps) were shortened to four steps only. The key&#8208;step of the present synthesis was the epimerization at C25 of the lactam intermediate. Different approaches to this reaction, i.e., a classical one via enolate, and a chemoselective umpolung transformation, were thoroughly investigated. The epimerization step is unnecessary if the starting sapogenin has the same configuration at C25 as the target alkaloid because the configuration at C25 (either R or S) remains intact throughout the synthesis. Thus, the related solanidane alkaloids, 12&#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;25&#8208;epi&#8208;demissidine and 5&#8208;epi&#8208;demissidine, were synthesized in the three&#8208;step procedure with retention of configuration at this stereogenic center from rockogenin (25R&#8208;5&#945;&#8208;sapogenin) or sarsasapogenin (25S&#8208;5&#946;&#8208;sapogenin), respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Design of A&#8722;D&#8722;A Electron Acceptors Towards Low Energy Loss for Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron&#8208;vibration coupling is an important factor affecting the energy loss of organic solar cells. Enhancing molecular planarity and rigidity, adopting angular fusion mode, and tuning electron&#8208;deficient core can effectively decrease the electron&#8208;vibration couplings of A&#8722;D&#8722;A electron acceptors to achieve efficient charge generation and low energy loss for organic photovoltaics.







Abstract
Low energy loss is a prerequisite for organic solar cells to achieve high photovoltaic efficiency. Electron&#8208;vibration coupling (i.&#8201;e., intramolecular reorganization energy) plays a crucial role in the photoelectrical conversion and energy loss processes. In this Concept article, we summarize our recent theoretical advances on revealing the energy loss mechanisms at the molecular level of A&#8722;D&#8722;A electron acceptors. We underline the importance of electron&#8208;vibration couplings on reducing the energy loss and describe the effective molecular design strategies towards low energy loss through decreasing the electron&#8208;vibration couplings.

         <title>Enhanced Photocatalytic Activity of Hyper&#8208;Cross&#8208;Linked Polymers Toward Amines Oxidation Coupled with H2O2 Generation through Extending Monomer's Conjugation Degree</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extending the monomer's conjugation degree of HCPs photocatalysts could significantly promote the separation and transfer efficiency of photogenerated carriers. QP&#8208;HCPs bring out the best photocatalytic activity for amines oxidation coupled with H2O2 generation due to its maximum monomer's conjugation degree and excellent O2 adsorption capacity.







Abstract
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven amines oxidation coupled with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation is a promising way to convert solar energy to chemical energy. Herein, a series of hyper&#8208;cross&#8208;linked polymers (HCPs) photocatalysts with different arenes monomers, including benzene (BE), diphenyl (DP), p&#8208;terphenyl (TP), or p&#8208;quaterphenyl (QP), were synthesized by simple Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation reaction. Owing to the maximum monomer's conjunction degree and excellent oxygen (O2) adsorption capacity, QP&#8208;HCPs exhibited highest photocatalytic activity for benzylamine oxidation coupled with H2O2 generation under the irradiation of 455&#8197;nm Blue LED lamp. More than 99&#8201;% of benzylamine could be converted to N&#8208;benzylidenebenzylamine within 60&#8197;min. In addition, nearly stoichiometric H2O2 was synchronously obtained with a high production rate of 9.3&#8197;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. Our work not only demonstrated that the photocatalytic activity of HCPs photocatalysts significantly depends on monomer's conjunction degree, but also provided a new strategy for converting solar energy to chemical energy.

Owing to the maximum monomer's conjunction degree and excellent oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) adsorption capacity, QP-HCPs exhibited highest photocatalytic activity for benzylamine oxidation coupled with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation under the irradiation of 455&#8197;nm Blue LED lamp. More than 99&#8201;% of benzylamine could be converted to N-benzylidenebenzylamine within 60&#8197;min. In addition, nearly stoichiometric H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was synchronously obtained with a high production rate of 9.3&#8197;mmol g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Our work not only demonstrated that the photocatalytic activity of HCPs photocatalysts significantly depends on monomer's conjunction degree, but also provided a new strategy for converting solar energy to chemical energy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Chelate Effect Rationalizes Observed Rate Acceleration and Enantioselectivity in BINOL&#8208;Catalyzed Petasis Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,1&#8242;&#8208;Bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (BINOL) induces high enantiomeric excess of Petasis reaction by forming cyclic B(IV)BINOL intermediates. The chelate formation results in an extraordinary reaction rate acceleration and in the diminishment of the racemic background reaction. An unusual iminium C&#8722;H and O&#8208;BINOL hydrogen bond is responsible for the stereoselectivity. Formation of a cyclic trigonal B(III)BINOL byproduct accompanying the product enables the BINOL catalyst turnover.







Abstract
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations afforded insight into the origin of the experimentally observed reaction rate acceleration (&#8805;500 fold) and enantioselectivity (&#8805;99&#8201;% ee) of 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol&#8208; (BINOL&#8208;) catalyzed three&#8208;component Petasis reactions . BINOL accelerates the rate determining step by forming a BIV chelate, which involves the loss of water from the hemiaminal moiety to generate an iminium intermediate. Subsequent vinyl group transfer from BIV to the iminium carbon affords the enantiomerically enriched product and a cyclic trigonal B(III)BINOL complex, which rapidly releases the BINOL allowing it to re&#8208;enter the catalytic cycle. In the transition state of the vinyl transfer step, C&#8722;H&#8722;O hydrogen bonding between the iminium C&#8722;H and O of (R)&#8208;BINOL directs the vinyl group addition to the Re&#8208;face of the iminium carbon. This mechanism explains both the rate acceleration and high enantioselectivity of the stereo determining step.

         <title>In situ X&#8208;ray Diffraction Studies on the Reduction of V2O5 and WO3 using Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reduction of metal oxides with hydrogen is widely used for the production of fine chemicals and metals both at laboratory and industry scale. In situ methods can help to elucidate reaction pathways and to gain control over such synthesis reactions. In this study, the reduction of WO3 and V2O5 with hydrogen has been investigated with in situ X&#8208;ray powder diffraction with regard to intermediates and influences of heating rates and hydrogen flow rates. Mixtures of V4O9, V6O13 as well as VO2 in two modifications are identified as intermediates on the way to phase pure V2O3. None of the intermediates are encountered isolated and can therefore not be prepared this way. In contrast, the intermediates of the WO3 reduction, H0.23WO3 and W10O29, appear consecutively and can be isolated. For both reactions, heating rate and flow rate have little influence on the formation of intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Directed Photooxidation Induced Conversion of Pyrrole&#8208;based Styryl Coumarins Dual&#8208;Color Photoconverters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dual&#8208;emissive photoconvertible fluorophores (DPCFs) are powerful tools in bioimaging to unambiguously track labelled cells in bioimaging. We recently introduced a new rational mechanism called directed photooxidation induced conversion (DPIC) enabling to obtain efficient DPCFs by conjugating a coumarin to aromatic singlet oxygen reactive moieties (ASORMs). Pyrrole was found to be a suitable ASORM as it provided a high hypsochromic shift along with a fast and efficient conversion. By synthesizing various pyrrole&#8208;based styryl coumarin dyes, we herein show that the photoconversion properties, including the quantum yield of photoconversion and the chemical yield of conversion can be tuned by chemical modification of the pyrrole. These modifications led to an improved dual emissive converter, SCP&#8208;Boc, which displayed a high brightness and an enhanced photoconversion yield of 63%. SCP&#8208;Boc was successfully used to sequentially photoconvert cells by laser scanning confocal microscopy.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A highly efficient regio&#8208; and stereoselective heterogeneous palladium&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration reaction of enallenes was developed. &#160;Nanopalladium immobilized on microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) was success&#173;fully employed as an efficient catalyst for the enallene hydro&#173;boration reaction. The nanopalladium particles were shown by HAADF&#8208;STEM to have an average size of 2.4 nm. &#160;The cellulose&#8208;supported palladium catalyst exhibits high stability and provides vinyl boron products in good to high isolated yields (up to 90%). The nanopalladium catalyst can be efficiently recycled and it was demonstrated that the catalyst ca be used in 7 runs with a maintained high yield (&gt;80%). The vinylboron compounds prepared from enallenes are important synthetic intermediates that can be used in various organic synthetic transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Principle for Complex Disordered Tetrahedral Frameworks in Quenched High&#8208;pressure Phases of Phosphorus Oxide Nitrides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The crystal structures of the new phosphorus oxide nitrides P40O31N46 and P74O59N84, which were synthesized from amorphous phosphorus oxide nitride imide, exhibit complex frameworks built up from P(O,N)4 tetrahedra. The latter form various chain&#8208;like building units of various branchedness. These modular units can be combined and arranged in different ways, which leads to closely related structures and several disordered configurations in each compound. As the material was obtained by high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature synthesis, the disorder is most likely a consequence of quenching a high&#8208;pressure phase with P(O,N)5 trigonal bipyramids. Under ambient conditions, P atoms are expected to relax by moving to the centers of the face&#8208;sharing tetrahedra that constitute the bipyramid. Diffraction patterns acquired with microfocused synchrotron radiation reveal that domains of both compounds are intergrown with H3P8O8N9, whose tetrahedral framework represents a cutout of the structures of both P40O31N46 and P74O59N84. Powder diffraction patterns do not indicate any further phases.</dc:description>

         <title>AAZTA&#8208;like ligands bearing phenolate arms as efficient chelators for 68Ga labelling in vitro and in vivo</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of a phenolate pendant arm in place of an acetate on AAZTA&#8208; and DATA&#8208;like ligands resulted in hepta&#8208; and hexadentate chelators able to form Ga(III) complexes with thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertness higher than that of other Ga(III) complexes based on the parent 6&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;methylperhydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazepine scaffold. In particular, the heptadentate AAZ3A&#8208;endoHB with a phenolate arm on an endocyclic N&#8208;atom shows a logKGaL of 27.35 and a remarkable resistance to hydroxide coordination up to basic pH (pH &gt; 9). This behaviour allows to also improve the kinetic inertness of the complex showing a dissociation half&#8208;life (t&#189;) at pH 7.4 of 76 h. Although also the hexadentate AAZ2A&#8208;exoHB chelator forms a stable (logKGaL = 24.69) and inert (t&#189; = 33 h at pH 7.4) Ga(III) complex, the 68Ga labelling showed a better radiochemical yield with AAZ3A&#8208;endoHB, especially at room temperature. Thus, a bifunctional chelator of AAZ3A&#8208;endoHB was synthesized bearing an isothiocyanate group that was conjugated to the N&#8208;terminus of a c(RGD) peptide for integrin receptor targeting. Finally, the conjugate was successfully labelled with 68Ga isotope, and the resulting radiotracer tested for its stability in human serum and then in vivo for targeting B16&#8208;F10 tumours with miniPET imaging.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The introduction of a phenolate pendant arm in place of an acetate on AAZTA- and DATA-like ligands resulted in hepta- and hexadentate chelators able to form Ga(III) complexes with thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertness higher than that of other Ga(III) complexes based on the parent 6-amino-6-methylperhydro-1,4-diazepine scaffold. In particular, the heptadentate AAZ3A-endoHB with a phenolate arm on an endocyclic N-atom shows a logKGaL of 27.35 and a remarkable resistance to hydroxide coordination up to basic pH (pH &amp;gt; 9). This behaviour allows to also improve the kinetic inertness of the complex showing a dissociation half-life (t&#189;) at pH 7.4 of 76 h. Although also the hexadentate AAZ2A-exoHB chelator forms a stable (logKGaL = 24.69) and inert (t&#189; = 33 h at pH 7.4) Ga(III) complex, the 68Ga labelling showed a better radiochemical yield with AAZ3A-endoHB, especially at room temperature. Thus, a bifunctional chelator of AAZ3A-endoHB was synthesized bearing an isothiocyanate group that was conjugated to the N-terminus of a c(RGD) peptide for integrin receptor targeting. Finally, the conjugate was successfully labelled with 68Ga isotope, and the resulting radiotracer tested for its stability in human serum and then in vivo for targeting B16-F10 tumours with miniPET imaging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiral Silanols: Strategies and Tactics for Their Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silanols, as the silicon analogues of alcohols, are valuable and important compounds, which have found widespread applications in the field of materials science, synthetic chemistry, and medicinal chemistry. This concept intends to highlight recent advances in the construction of silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanols, and hope to inspire chemists to continue contributing to the development of novel synthetic methods toward chiral silanols.







Abstract
Silanols are valuable and important compounds, which have found widespread applications in the field of materials science, synthetic chemistry, and medicinal chemistry. Although a handful of approaches have been developed for the synthesis of various silanols, access to enantioenriched silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanols remains underdeveloped. This Concept article intends to summarize and highlight recent advances in the construction of silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanols and endeavors to encourage further research in this area.

         <title>Intermolecular Covalent Interactions: Nature and Directionality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
There is a hole in the model! The directionality of intermolecular pnictogen, chalcogen, and halogen bonds comes forth from minimizing closed&#8208;shell Pauli repulsion between bond donor and acceptor. The &#963;&#8208;hole model lacks the fundamental physics behind intermolecular electrostatic interactions and consequently attributes their directionality erroneously to maximizing the electrostatic attraction.







Abstract
Quantum chemical methods were employed to analyze the nature and the origin of the directionality of pnictogen (PnB), chalcogen (ChB), and halogen bonds (XB) in archetypal FmZ&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F&#8722; complexes (Z=Pn, Ch, X), using relativistic density functional theory (DFT) at ZORA&#8208;M06/QZ4P. Quantitative Kohn&#8208;Sham MO and energy decomposition analyses (EDA) show that all these intermolecular interactions have in common that covalence, that is, HOMO&#8722;LUMO interactions, provide a crucial contribution to the bond energy, besides electrostatic attraction. Strikingly, all these bonds are directional (i.e., F&#8722;Z&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F&#8722; is approximately linear) despite, and not because of, the electrostatic interactions which, in fact, favor bending. This constitutes a breakdown of the &#963;&#8208;hole model. It was shown how the &#963;&#8208;hole model fails by neglecting both, the essential physics behind the electrostatic interaction and that behind the directionality of electron&#8208;rich intermolecular interactions. Our findings are general and extend to the neutral, weaker ClI&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;NH3, HClTe&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;NH3, and H2ClSb&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;NH3 complexes.

Very radical: The recent advances of glycosyl radical&#8208;based C&#8208;glycosylation modification of amino acids and peptides are summarized, and perspectives for the further study of radical C&#8208;glycosylation reactions are presented.







Abstract
Radical&#8208;based reactions usually exhibit excellent functional&#8208;group compatibilities due to their mild initiation conditions. Glycosyl radical involved C&#8208;glycosylation modifications are important strategies to achieve highly regio&#8208; and chemoselective constructions of C&#8208;glycosidic bonds or C&#8208;glycoside linkages of peptides and proteins. In this Concept, we cover recent developments in glycosyl radical&#8208;based synthesis of unnatural amino acids and late&#8208;stage modification of peptides and proteins, and provide a preliminary outlook on the possible development of this direction in the future.

         <title>Quest for a Rational Molecular Design of Alkyl&#8211;Distyrylbenzene Liquid by Substitution Pattern Modulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkyl&#8208;&#960; functional molecular liquids (FMLs) are of interest for fabricating soft electronic devices due to their fluidic nature and innate optoelectronic functions from the &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety. However, predictable development of alkyl&#8208;&#960; FMLs with the desired liquid and optoelectronic properties is challenging. A series of alkyl&#8211;distyrylbenzene (DSB) liquids was studied in terms of the substituent position effect by attaching 2&#8208;octyldodecyl chains at (2,4&#8208;), (2,5&#8208;), (2,6&#8208;), and (3,5&#8208;). The effect of the alkyl chain length was investigated by attaching 2&#8208;hexyldecyl, 2&#8208;decyltetradecyl (C10C14), and 2&#8208;dodecylhexadecyl at the (2,5&#8208;) substituent position. The 2,5C10C14 substituent pattern constructed a superior alkyl&#8211;DSB liquid with a lower viscosity, intrinsic optical properties, and high thermal&#8208; and photo&#8208;stabilities. The discovered 2,5&#8208;C10C14 was applied to dicyanostyrylbenzene and comparable liquid physical and optical superiorities were confirmed. This molecular design is useful for creating alkyl&#8208;&#960; FMLs with the aforementioned advantages, which are applicable for deformable and flowable optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoreactivity Driven by Excited State Aromaticity Gain or Antiaromaticity Relief</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gain of aromaticity or relief of antiaromaticity along a reaction path are important factors to consider in mechanism studies. Analysis of such changes along potential energy surfaces has historically focused on reactions in the electronic ground state (S0) but can also be utilized for excited states. In the lowest &#960;&#960;* states the electron counts for aromaticity and antiaromaticity follow Baird&#8217;s rule where 4n &#960;&#8208;electrons indicate aromaticity and 4n+2 &#960;&#8208;electrons antiaromaticity. Yet, there are also cases where H&#252;ckel&#8217;s rule plays a role in the excited state. The electron count reversals of Baird&#8217;s rule compared to H&#252;ckel&#8217;s rule explain many altered physicochemical properties upon excitation of (hetero)annulene derivatives. Here we illustrate how gain of excited state aromaticity (ESA) and relief of excited state antiaromaticity (ESAA) impact on photoreactivity and photostability. Emphasis is placed on recent findings supported by results of quantum chemical calculations, and photoreactions in a wide variety of areas are covered.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanoresponsive Metal&#8208;Organic Cage&#8208;Crosslinked Polymer Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the formation of metal&#8208;organic cage&#8208;crosslinked polymer hydrogels. To enable crosslinking of the cages and subsequent network formation, we used homodifunctionalized poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chains terminally substituted with bipyridines as ligands for the Pd6L4 corners. The encapsulation of guest molecules into supramolecular self&#8208;assembled metal&#8208;organic cage&#8208;crosslinked hydrogels, as well as ultrasound&#8208;induced disassembly of the cages with release of their cargo, is presented in addition to their characterization by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques, rheology, and comprehensive small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) experiments. The constrained geometries simulating external force (CoGEF) method and barriers using a force&#8208;modified potential energy surface (FMPES) suggest that the cage&#8208;opening mechanism starts with the dissociation of one pyridine ligand at around 0.5 nN. We show the efficient sonochemical activation of the hydrogels HG1&#8208;6, increasing the non&#8208;covalent guest&#8208;loading of completely unmodified drugs available for release by a factor of ten in comparison to non&#8208;crosslinked, star&#8208;shaped assemblies in solution.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The combination of the alkoxyphosphoranes, Ph2P(OR)(O2C6Cl4) and the borane B(C6F5)3 generates the zwitterions 3 which act as FLP to effect the alkylation of several nucleophiles affording C&#8208;C, C&#8208;N, C&#8208;H and C&#8208;Cl coupling products. A DFT study shows the reaction proceeds via an FLP activation pathway generating an alkoxyphosphonium intermediate which effects the alkylation of the nucleophiles, akin to the Mitsunobu reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent Construction of N&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons with Indole as the&#160;Nitrogen Source Building Block</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An Ag/Au catalyzed divergent cascade reaction of alkyne embedded diazoketones with indoles has been described. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction goes through a [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of an in situ formed isobenzopyrylium intermediate with indole, followed by a sequential retro&#8208;Michael addition/carbene N&#8208;H insertion process to give the benzo[i]phenanthridines products with gold catalysis; whereas a dearomatization/rearomatization sequence occurs favourably when the reaction is catalyzed by a silver catalyst, delivering benzo[b]carbazoles in generally high to excellent yields. Notably, this is a rare example of using indole as the dienophile for cycloaddition with the isobenzopyrylium species, providing a concise and practical approach for the selective construction of N&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with structural diversity and broad functional group compatibility.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The relationship between the overall electronic structure of &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules and the arrangement of their constituent elements is of fundamental importance. Establishing rational design guidelines for conjugated hydrocarbons with narrow HOMO&#8211;LUMO gaps is useful to develop near&#8208;infrared (NIR) responsive dyes and redox&#8208;active materials. Here, we describe the synthesis and properties of three conjugated hydrocarbons, i.e., an indenonaphthoperylene, an indenoterrylene, and a diindenoterrylene. These molecules exhibit NIR absorption despite the absence of significant antiaromaticity and diradical character. Notably, the indenonaphthoperylene exhibits red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR emission in the 620&#8211;850 nm region. The indenoterrylene and the diindenoterrylene exhibit NIR absorption tailing to 870 and 940 nm, respectively. Moreover, the effect of the &#960;&#8208;extension of indenoperylene is disclosed in order to propose guidelines for achieving a narrow HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap with negligible antiaromaticity and diradical character.</dc:description>

         <title>Polarity&#8208;Evolution Control and Luminescence Regulation in Multiple&#8208;Site Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) have shown great potential in separation, sensing and host&#8208;guest chemistry, however, the pre&#8208;design of HOFs remains challenging due to the uncertainty of solvents' participation in framework formation. Herein, the polarity&#8208;evolution&#8208;controlled framework/luminescence regulation was firstly demonstrated based on multiple&#8208;site hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks. Several distinct HOFs were prepared by changing bonding modes of building units via the evolution of electrostatic forces induced by various solvent polarities. High&#8208;polar solvents with strong electrostatic attraction to surrounding units showed the tendency to form cage structures, while low&#8208;polar solvents with weak electrostatic attraction only occupy hydrogen&#8208;bond sites, conducive to the channel formation. Furthermore, the conformation of optical building unit can be adjusted by affecting the solvent polarity, generating different luminescence outputs. These results pave ways for the rational design of ideal HOFs with on&#8208;demand framework regulation and luminescence properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Dioxygen Binding is Controlled by the Protein Environment in Non&#8208;Heme Fe(II) and 2&#8208;Oxoglutarate Oxygenases &#8211; A Study on Histone Demethylase PHF8 and an Ethylene Forming Enzyme</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study investigates dioxygen binding and 2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG) coordination by two model non&#8208;heme Fe(II)/2OG enzymes: a class 7 histone demethylase (PHF8) that catalyzes the hydroxylation of its H3K9me2 histone substrate leading to demethylation reactivity and the ethylene&#8208;forming enzyme (EFE) that catalyzes two competing reactions of ethylene generation and substrate L&#8208;Arg hydroxylation. Although both enzymes initially bind 2OG using an off&#8208;line 2OG coordination mode, in PHF8, the substrate oxidation requires a transition to an in&#8208;line mode, whereas EFE is catalytically productive for ethylene production from 2OG via the off&#8208;line mode. We utilized classical molecular dynamics, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) MD and QM/MM metadynamics simulations to reveal that it is the dioxygen binding process and, ultimately, the protein environment that control the formation of the in&#8208;line Fe(III)&#8208;OO&#8208;. intermediate in PHF8 and the off&#8208;line Fe(III)&#8208;OO&#8208;. intermediate in EFE.</dc:description>

We utilized classical molecular dynamics, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) MD and QM/MM metadynamics simulations to reveal that it is the dioxygen binding process and, ultimately, the protein environment that control the formation of the in-line Fe(III)-OO-. intermediate in PHF8 and the off-line Fe(III)-OO-. intermediate in EFE.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
