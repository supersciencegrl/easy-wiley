         <title>Mechanistic Investigation on Chemiluminescent Formaldehyde Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A first&#8208;generation pair of chemiluminescent formaldehyde (FA) probes&#160;(CFAP540 and CFAP700) was reported recently. CFAP540 and CFAP700 with high selectivity and sensitivity to FA, are respectively suitable in cell and in vivo. Experimentalists have confirmed that both probes utilize a general 2&#8208;aza&#8208;Cope FA&#8208;reactive trigger and a chemiluminogenic phenoxydioxetane scaffold. The mechanism and detailed process of CFAP chemiluminescence (CL) remain largely unknown. In the present paper, we performed (time&#8208;dependent) density functional theory calculations on the entire reaction process of CFAP540 with FA to produce CL. The calculations elucidated the CL producing process: FA initiates the decomposition of CFAP540 by dehydration condensation, and a phenoxy 1,2&#8208;dioxetane is formed through a series of reactions of aza&#8208;Cope rearrangement, hydrolysis of imine, and &#946;&#8208;elimination of alkoxyl group. Afterwards, the produced phenoxy 1,2&#8208;dioxetane decomposes to produce m&#8208;oxybenzoate derivative at the first singlet state (S1) via two crossings between potential energy surfaces of the ground state (S0) and S1 state. This m&#8208;oxybenzoate derivative was assigned to the light emitter of the CFAP540 CL. The CL producing process and assignment of the light emitter of CFAP700 CL are similar with the corresponding ones of CFAP540. By analyzing the D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A architecture of the light emitters of CFAP540 and CFAP700, we theoretically designed a series of CFAPs and proposed a scheme to modulate their CL from visible to near&#8208;infrared region by adjusting the length and structure of the &#960;&#8208;bridge.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Unsymmetrical Dithioacetals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dithioacetals are a frequently used motif in synthetic organic chemistry and have recently seen increasing attention as structural motif in promising antiviral agents against plant pathogens. Most existing reports, however, only discuss symmetrical dithioacetals. Examples of mixed dithioacetals are scarce and no general method for the selective synthesis of these compounds exists. Herein, we present a synthetically simple general one&#8208;step protocol for the synthesis of a broad range of unsymmetrical dithioacetals consisting of one aromatic and one aliphatic thiol moiety from the corresponding aldehyde/thiol mixture. The mixed  S  ,  S  &#8208;acetals are obtained is high yields and a great variety of functional groups is tolerated. Kinetic control enables an excellent selectivity in regard to the unsymmetrical dithioacetal.</dc:description>

         <title>D&#8208;A Interactions Induced Interfacial Synthesis of Ultrathin Fluoric Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymer via Photochemical [2 + 2] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional polymers (2DPs) have attracted much interest due to their unique 2D atomic&#8208;thick covalent network with periodically linked monomers. The preparation of mono&#8208; or few&#8208;layered 2DPs with highly ordered structures is still a big challenge. Here, we report a preparation of ultrathin 2DP film based on photo&#8208;triggered [2 + 2] cycloaddition at the air/water interface. The pre&#8208;assembly process induced by the D&#8208;A interactions before the polymerization plays a key role in constructing highly ordered structure. The precise structure and chemical compositions of the continuous 2DP films were proved by selected area electron diffraction (SAED), tip&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (TERS) and molecular&#8208;mechanics&#8208;based structural simulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Easy Access to Enantiomerically Pure Heterocyclic Silicon&#8208;Chiral Phosphonium Cations and the Matched/Mismatched Case of Dihydrogen Release</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphonium ions are widely used in preparative organic synthesis and catalysis. The provision of new types of cations that contain both functional and chiral information is a major synthetic challenge and can open up new horizons in asymmetric cation&#8208;directed and Lewis acid catalysis. We discovered an efficient methodology towards new Si&#8208;chiral four&#8208;membered CPSSi* heterocyclic cations. Three synthetic approaches are presented. The stereochemical sequence of anchimerically assisted cation formation with B(C6F5)3 and subsequent hydride addition was fully elucidated and proceeds with excellent preservation of the chiral information at the stereogenic silicon atom. Also the mechanism of dihydrogen release from a protonated hydrosilane was studied in detail by the help of Si&#8208;centered chirality as stereochemical probe. Chemoselectivity switch (dihydrogen release vs. protodesilylation) can easily be achieved through slight modifications of the solvent. A matched/mismatched case was identified and the intermolecularity of this reaction supported by spectroscopic, kinetic, deuterium labeling experiments, and quantum chemical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton&#8208;Functionalized Graphitic Carbon Nitride for Efficient Metal&#8208;Free Disinfection of Escherichia Coli under Low&#8208;Power Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Universal&#160;access to clean water has been the global ambition over the years. Photocatalytic water disinfection via advanced oxidation processes has been regarded as one of the promising methods in breaking down microbials. The forefront of this research focuses on the application of metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for disinfection to prevent secondary pollution. Graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) has achieved instant notoriety as a metal&#8208;free and visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive photocatalyst for various energy and environmental applications. However, the efficiency of g&#8208;C3N4  in photocatalysis is still affected by its rapid charge recombination and sluggish electron transfer kinetics. In this contribution, two&#8208;dimensional protonated g&#8208;C3N4  was employed as metal&#8208;free photocatalyst for water treatment and demonstrated 100% disinfection of  Escherichia coli  within 4 h under 23 W light bulb irradiation. The introduction of protonation can modulate the surface charge of g&#8208;C3N4  which enhance its conductivity and provide a &#8220;highway&#8221; for the delocalization of electrons. This work highlights the potential of conjugated polymer in antibacterial application.</dc:description>

Cyclization: 3,4&#8208;Diphenyl isoquinoline and 2,3&#8208;diphenyl indole have been synthesized by catalytic bis&#8208;arylative endo cyclization of gold acetylides. By this synthetic approach, a six&#8208;membered mesoionic NHC&#8211;complex has also been obtained, which could be used as precursors for the synthesis of 1,3&#8208;NHDC Au2 and Au/Ag complexes. Catalytically relevant vicinal diaurated alkene intermediates have been isolated and fully characterized.







Abstract
3,4&#8208;Diphenyl isoquinoline and 2,3&#8208;diphenyl indole are readily accessed by catalytic selective bis&#8208;arylative endo cyclization of gold acetylides. The synthetic approach could be also extended to prepare six&#8208;membered mesoionic NHC complex, which could further undergo deprotonation/complexation to afford 1,3&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic dicarbene (NHDCs) Au2 and Au/Ag complexes. The key vicinal diaurated alkene intermediates have been isolated and the studies on their reactivities towards coupling partners reinforce the proposed mechanisms.

         <title>Photocontrolled DNA Origami Assembly by Using Two Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Let there be light! An arylazopyrazole (AAP) photoswitching system is introduced to extend the variety of available wavelengths of photoswitches to control the photoinduced assembly and disassembly of DNA origami nanostructures. Different assembly configurations are also achieved by using two photoswitches, AAP and azobenzene, in tandem with different irradiation wavelengths.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive switching molecules have been widely investigated for the purpose of the mechanical control of biomolecules. Recently developed arylazopyrazole (AAP) shows photoisomerization activity, displaying a faster response to light&#8208;induced conformational changes and unique absorption spectral properties compared with those of conventionally used azobenzene. Herein, it is demonstrated that AAP can be used as a photoswitching molecule to control photoinduced assembly and disassembly of DNA origami nanostructures. An AAP&#8208;modified DNA origami has been designed and constructed. It is observed that the repeated assembly and disassembly of AAP&#8208;modified X&#8208;shaped DNA origami and hexagonal origami with complementary strands can be achieved by alternating UV and visible&#8208;light irradiation. Closed and linear assemblies of AAP&#8208;modified X&#8208;shaped origami were successfully formed by photoirradiation, and more than 1&#8197;&#956;m linear assemblies were formed. Finally, it is shown that the two photoswitches, AAP and azobenzene, can be used in tandem to independently control different assembly configurations by using different irradiation wavelengths. AAP can extend the variety of available wavelengths of photoswitches and stably result in the assembly and disassembly of various DNA origami nanostructures.

         <title>Ultrafast Charge Delocalization Dynamics of Ambient Stable CsPbBr3 Nanocrystals Encapsulated in Polystyrene Fiber</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskites in polystyrene: The stability of perovskites is a major concern for practical applications. To overcome this problem, ambient stable CsPbBr3 nanocrystals (NCs) encapsulated in transparent polystyrene fibers (CsPbBr3@PS) were prepared by electrospinning. The encapsulated fibers were found to be stable under water for months while retaining their photoluminescence. These embedded CsPbBr3 NCs in a transparent PS fiber with much slower carrier cooling compared with pristine CsPbBr3 could be useful for designing practical devices.







Abstract
CsPbBr3 nanocrystals (NCs) encapsulated in a transparent polystyrene (PS) fiber matrix (CsPbBr3@PS) have been synthesized to protect the NCs. The ultrafast charge delocalization dynamics of the embedded NCs have been demonstrated, and the results are compared with the pristine CsPbBr3 in toluene. The electrospinning method was employed for the preparation of CsPbBr3@PS fibers by using a polystyrene solution doped with pre&#8208;synthesized CsPbBr3 and characterized by XRD, HRTEM, and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Energy level diagrams of CsPbBr3 and PS suggest that CsPbBr3@PS fibers make a type&#8197;I core&#8211;shell structure. The carrier cooling for CsPbBr3@PS fibers is found to be much slower than pure CsPbBr3 NCs. This observation suggests that photoexcited electrons from CsPbBr3 NCs get delocalized from the conduction band of the perovskite to lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the PS fiber matrix. The CsPbBr3@PS fibers possess remarkable stability under ambient conditions as well as in water over months. The clear understanding of charge carrier relaxation dynamics of CsPbBr3 confined in PS fibers could help to design robust optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Galectin&#8211;Glycan Interactions: Guidelines for Monitoring by 77Se NMR Spectroscopy, and Solvent (H2O/D2O) Impact on Binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selenoglycosides offer attractive benefits over natural O&#8208;glycans for studying molecular recognition processes, such as access to specific 77Se NMR spectroscopy. We evaluate NMR methods for 1H,77Se correlation, including the new selective HeHaHa experiment. We show that the thermodynamics of selenodigalactoside binding to human galectins remains unaltered, but a clear solvent effect is observed if the glycan chain is extended.







Abstract
Functional pairing between cellular glycoconjugates and tissue lectins like galectins has wide (patho)physiological significance. Their study is facilitated by nonhydrolysable derivatives of the natural O&#8208;glycans, such as S&#8208; and Se&#8208;glycosides. The latter enable extensive analyses by specific 77Se NMR spectroscopy, but still remain underexplored. By using the example of selenodigalactoside (SeDG) and the human galectin&#8208;1 and &#8208;3, we have evaluated diverse 77Se NMR detection methods and propose selective 1H,77Se heteronuclear Hartmann&#8211;Hahn transfer for efficient use in competitive NMR screening against a selenoglycoside spy ligand. By fluorescence anisotropy, circular dichroism, and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we show that the affinity and thermodynamics of SeDG binding by galectins are similar to thiodigalactoside (TDG) and N&#8208;acetyllactosamine (LacNAc), confirming that Se substitution has no major impact. ITC data in D2O versus H2O are similar for TDG and LacNAc binding by both galectins, but a solvent effect, indicating solvent rearrangement at the binding site, is hinted at for SeDG and clearly observed for LacNAc dimers with extended chain length.

         <title>Enhanced Adsorption of Polysulfides on Carbon Nanotubes/Boron Nitride Fibers for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Endurance cyclists: We developed a novel sulfur cathode by intertwining multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and boron nitride fibers (BNFs). The intertwined structure served to localize the lithium polysulfide dissolved in the electrolyte within the cathode region, leading to low active sulfur loss and improved cycling stability. Cycled at 4&#8197;C, the cell still preserved a highly reversible capacity after 500 cycles with a capacity decay of only 0.044&#8201;% per cycle.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries are one of the most promising high&#8208;energy&#8208;density storage systems. However, serious capacity attenuation and poor cycling stability induced by the shuttle effect of polysulfide intermediates can impede the practical application of Li&#8208;S batteries. Herein we report a novel sulfur cathode by intertwining multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and porous boron nitride fibers (BNFs) for the subsequent loading of sulfur. This structural design enables trapping of active sulfur and serves to localize the soluble polysulfide within the cathode region, leading to low active material loss. Compared with CNTs/S, CNTs/BNFs/S cathodes deliver a high initial capacity of 1222&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C. Upon increasing the current density to 4&#8197;C, the cell retained a capacity of 482&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles with a capacity decay of only 0.044&#8201;% per cycle. The design of CNTs/BNFs/S gives new insight on how to optimize cathodes for Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Sensitive Self&#8208;Assembled Tubules Based on Lysine&#8208;Derived Surfactants for Delivery of Antimicrobial Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled tubules composed by novel lysine&#8208;derived surfactants form hydrogels and undergo a temperature&#8208;driven transition to micelles or vesicles. The tubule&#8208;based hydrogels are able to efficiently load lysozyme (LZM), a model antimicrobial enzyme, and to release it upon temperature or pH changes. Both the neat surfactant and surfactant/LZM hydrogels show low cytotoxicity against human cell cultures, highlighting the potential of these systems for stimuli&#8208;responsive delivery.







Abstract
Drug delivery vectors based on amphiphiles have important features such as versatile physicochemical properties and stimuli&#8208;responsiveness. Amino acid&#8208;based surfactants are especially promising amphiphiles due to their enhanced biocompatibility compared to conventional surfactants. They can self&#8208;organize into micelles, vesicles and complex hierarchical structures, such as fibers, twisted and coiled ribbons, and tubules. In this work, we investigated the self&#8208;assembly and drug loading properties of a family of novel anionic double&#8208;tailed lysine&#8208;derived surfactants, with variable degree of tail length mismatch, designated as mLys10 and 10Lysn, where m and n are the number of carbon atoms in the tails. These surfactants form tubular aggregates with assorted morphologies in water that undergo gelation due to dense entanglement, as evidenced by light and electron microscopy. Lysozyme (LZM), an enzyme with antimicrobial properties, was selected as model protein for loading. After the characterization of the interfacial properties and phase behavior of the amphiphiles, the LZM&#8208;loading ability of the tubules was investigated, under varying experimental conditions, to assess the efficiency of the aggregates as pH&#8208; and temperature&#8208;sensitive nanocarriers. Further, the toxicological profile of the surfactants per se and surfactant/LZM hydrogels was obtained, using human skin fibroblasts (BJ&#8208;5ta cell line). Overall, the results show that the tubule&#8208;based hydrogels exhibit very interesting properties for the transport and controlled release of molecules of therapeutic interest.

         <title>Aerobic Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Salicylaldehydic Cformyl&#8211;H Arylations with Arylboronic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a challenging copper&#8208;catalyzed Cformyl&#8722;H arylation of salicylaldehydes with arylboronic acids, which involves unique salicylaldehydic copper&#8208;species differing from reported salicylaldehydic rhodacycle and palladacycle. Also, this protocol has high chemoselectivity for the Cformyl&#8722;H bond compared to the phenolic O&#8722;H bond involving copper catalysis under high reaction temperature. This approach is compatible with a wide range of salicylaldehyde and arylboronic acid substrates, including estrone and carbazole derivatives, which leads to corresponding arylation products. Mechanistic studies show that 2&#8208;hydroxy group of salicylaldehyde substrate triggers the formation of salicylaldehydic copper complexes via Cu(I)/Cu(II)/Cu(III) catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An effcient approach to the type III lepadin alkaloids (lepadins F and G) has been developed via a key Diels&#8722;Alder reaction, in which a novel ketolactone&#8208;type dienophile with chiral diol unit is employed to generate the desirable all&#8208;cis&#8208;trisubstituted cyclohexene in excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity control.

         <title>Ferrous to ferric transition in Fe&#8208;phthalocyanine driven by NO2 exposure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to its unique magnetic properties offered by the open&#8208;shell electronic structure of the central metal ion, and for being an effective catalyst in a wide variety of reactions, iron phthalocyanine has drawn significant interest from the scientific community. Nevertheless, upon surface deposition, the magnetic properties of the molecular layer can be significantly affected by the coupling occurring at the interface, and the more reactive the surface, the stronger is the impact on the spin state. Here we show that on Cu(100), indeed, the strong hybridization between the Fe  d  &#8208;states of FePc and the  sp  band of the copper substrate modifies the charge distribution in the molecule, significantly influencing the magnetic properties of the iron ion. The Fe  II  ion is stabilized in the low singlet spin state (S=0), leading to the complete quenching of the molecule&#8217;s magnetic moment. By exploiting the FePc/Cu(100) interface, we demonstrate that NO  2  dissociation can be used to gradually change the magnetic properties of the iron ion, by trimming the gas dosage. For lower doses, the FePc film is decoupled from the copper substrate, restoring the gas phase triplet spin state (S=1). A higher dose induces the transition from ferrous to ferric phthalocyanine, in its intermediate spin state, with enhanced magnetic moment due to the interaction with the atomic ligands. Remarkably, in this way, three different spin configurations have been observed within the same metalorganic/metal interface by exposing it to different doses of NO  2  at room temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Breslow Intermediates (Amino Enols) and Their Keto Tautomers: First Gas&#8208;Phase Characterization by IR Ion Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Breslow intermediates in the gas phase: In N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed Umpolung, the reaction of the substrate aldehyde with the NHC gives the Breslow intermediate (BI) as pivotal species. The combination of IR ion spectroscopy with quantum chemical computations can determine whether the BI exists as a nucleophilic amino enol or as its keto tautomer in the gas phase, which is decisive for its reactivity both in enzymatic catalysis and in organocatalysis.







Abstract
Breslow intermediates (BIs) are the crucial nucleophilic amino enol intermediates formed from electrophilic aldehydes in the course of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed umpolung reactions. Both in organocatalytic and enzymatic umpolung, the question whether the Breslow intermediate exists as the nucleophilic enol or in the form of its electrophilic keto tautomer is of utmost importance for its reactivity and function. Herein, the preparation of charge&#8208;tagged Breslow intermediates/keto tautomers derived from three different types of NHCs (imidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenes, 1,2,4&#8208;triazolin&#8208;5&#8208;ylidenes, thiazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenes) and aldehydes is reported. An ammonium charge tag is introduced through the aldehyde unit or the NHC. ESI&#8208;MS IR ion spectroscopy allowed the unambiguous conclusion that in the gas phase, the imidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene&#8208;derived BI indeed exists as a diamino enol, while both 1,2,4&#8208;triazolin&#8208;5&#8208;ylidenes and thiazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenes give the keto tautomer. This result coincides with the tautomeric states observed for the BIs in solution (NMR) and in the crystalline state (XRD), and is in line with our earlier calculations on the energetics of BI keto&#8211;enol equilibria.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Breslow intermediates in the gas phase&lt;/b&gt;: In &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed Umpolung, the reaction of the substrate aldehyde with the NHC gives the Breslow intermediate (BI) as pivotal species. The combination of IR ion spectroscopy with quantum chemical computations can determine whether the BI exists as a nucleophilic amino enol or as its keto tautomer in the gas phase, which is decisive for its reactivity both in enzymatic catalysis and in organocatalysis.

         <title>Enzymatic Formation of Indolactam Scaffold by C&#8722;N Bond&#8208;Forming Cytochrome P450 Oxidases in Teleocidin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymatic formation of indolactam: This minireview focuses on recent research progress on the elucidation of the molecular basis for the P450&#8208;catalyzed remarkable intramolecular C&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming reaction to generate the indolactam scaffold. In addition, precursor&#8208;directed biosynthesis led to formation of a series of unnatural novel molecular scaffolds including a sulfur&#8208;substituted indolactam, conformation of which is significantly different from that of indolactam&#8197;V.







Abstract
Teleocidins are potent protein kinase&#8197;C activators, and possess a unique indole&#8208;fused nine&#8208;membered lactam structure. Teleocidin biosynthesis starts from the formation of a dipeptide by non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), followed by oxidative C&#8722;N bond formation by a cytochrome P450 oxidase, reverse&#8208;prenylation by a prenyltransferase, and methylation&#8208;initiated terpene cyclization by a C&#8208;methyltransferase. This minireview focuses on recent research progress toward the elucidation of the molecular basis for the remarkable P450&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular C&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming reaction, which is challenging in synthetic chemistry, to generate the indolactam scaffold. In addition, precursor&#8208;directed biosynthesis with the promiscuous P450 enzymes led to the formation of a series of unnatural and novel molecular scaffolds, including a sulfur&#8208;substituted indolactam with a different conformation from that of indolactam&#8197;V.

         <title>Electrochemical and Solvent&#8208;Mediated Visible&#8208;to&#8208;Near&#8208;Infrared Spectroscopic Switching of Benzoselenadiazole Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Color chart: A fluorophore whose emission spans the visible to the NIR regions depending on solvent has been prepared. Its visible color reversibly bleached upon electrochemical oxidation with the concomitant formation of a new absorption peak in the NIR. Its fluorescence could also be quenched by applying a potential.







Abstract
A series of electronic push&#8211;pull, pull&#8211;pull, and push fluorophores has been prepared from a benzoselenadiazole core so that their spectroscopic, electrochemical, spectro&#8208;electrochemical, and spectro&#8208;electrofluorescence properties could be examined. The emission wavelengths and fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;fl) of the N,N&#8208;dimethyl fluorophores were contingent on the solvent polarity and they ranged from 615 to 850&#8197;nm in aprotic solvents. The positive solvatochromism and the quenched &#934;fl in polar solvents were consistent with an intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer state (ICT). Meanwhile, a locally excited state (LE) was assigned in nonpolar solvents from the blue&#8208;shifted emission and high &#934;fl. The N,N&#8208;dimethylamine fluorophores examined could be both electrochemically oxidized and reduced, whereas the symmetric dinitro pull&#8211;pull derivative could be only reversibly reduced. Courtesy of their electrochemical reversibility, the fluorophores could reversibly change color from yellow to blue with an applied potential in addition to switching off their emission. The absorption of the electrochemically generated intermediates of the N,N&#8208;dimethyl derivatives spanned 500&#8197;nm over the visible and the NIR regions. The colors could be switched for upwards of two hours with applied potential, illustrating their potential use as electroactive materials in electrochromic devices.

         <title>Synthesis of Mixed&#8208;Functionalized Tetraacylgermanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Just mix it! Mixed&#8208;functionalized tetraacylgermanes were synthesized by two innovative pathways. These new derivatives outperform the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art germanium based photoinitiators in terms of both solubility and absorption properties.







Abstract
Tetraacylgermanes are known as highly efficient photoinitiators. Herein, the synthesis of mixed tetraacylgermanes 4&#8201;a&#8211;c and 6&#8201;a&#8211;e with a nonsymmetric substitution pattern is presented. Germenolates are crucial intermediates of these new synthetic protocols. The synthesized compounds show increased solubility compared with symmetrically substituted tetraacylgermanes 1&#8201;a&#8211;d. Moreover, these mixed derivatives reveal broadened n&#8211;&#960;* absorption bands, which enhance their photoactivity. Higher absorption of these new compounds at wavelengths above 450&#8197;nm causes efficient photobleaching when using an LED emitting at 470&#8197;nm. The quantum yields are in the range of 0.15&#8211;0.57, depending on the nature of the aroyl substituents. On the basis of these properties, mixed&#8208;functionalized tetraacylgermanes serve as ideal photoinitiators in various applications, especially in those requiring high penetration depth. The synthesized compounds were characterized by elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy, NMR and CIDNP spectroscopy, UV/Vis spectroscopy, photolysis experiments, and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The CIDNP data suggest that the germyl radicals generated from the new tetraacylgermanes preferentially add to the tail of the monomer butyl acrylate. In the case of 6&#8201;a&#8211;e only the mesitoyl groups are cleaved off, whereas for 4&#8201;a&#8211;c both the mesitoyl and the aroyl group are subject to &#945;&#8208;cleavage.

         <title>Azolium/hydroquinone organo&#8208;radical co&#8208;catalysis: Aerobic C&#8210;C&#8208;bond cleavage in ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organo&#8208;radical catalysts have recently attracted great interest, and the development of this field can be expected to broaden the applications of organocatalysis. Herein, we report the first example of a radical&#8208;generating system that does not require any photoirradiation, radical initiators, or preactivated substrates. The oxidative C&#8211;C&#8208;bond cleavage of 2&#8208;substituted cyclohexanones was achieved using an azolium salt and a hydroquinone as co&#8208;catalysts. A catalytic mechanism is proposed based on the results of diffusion&#8208;ordered spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry measurements, as well as computational studies.</dc:description>

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Bridge Substitution in DASAs: the Subtle Equilibrium Between Photochemical Improvements and Thermal Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Donor&#8211;Acceptor Stenhouse Adducts (DASAs) are playing an outstanding role as innovative and versatile photoswitches. Until now, all the efforts have been spent on modifying donor and acceptor moieties, to modulate the absorption energy and improve the cyclization and reversion kinetics. However, there is a strong dependence on specific structural modifications and a lack of predictive behavior, mostly due to the complex photoswitching mechanism. Here, by means of a combined experimental and theoretical study, we systematically explore the effect of chemical modification of the &#960;&#8208;bridge linking the donor and acceptor moieties, finding significant impact on the absorption, photocyclization and relative stability of the open form. Especially, a position along the &#960;&#8208;bridge is found to be the most suited to red&#8208;shift the absorption while preserving cyclization. However, thermal back&#8208;reaction to the initial isomer is blocked. These effects are explained in terms of an increased acceptor capability offered by the &#960;&#8208;bridge substituent that can be modulated. This strategy opens the path toward derivatives with infra&#8208;red absorption and a potential anchoring point for further functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Ferrimagnetic Ordering and Anomalous Stoichiometry Observed for the Cubic, Extended 3D Prussian Blue Analogues (NEt3Me)2MnII5(CN)12 and (NEt2Me2)2MnII5(CN)12: A Cation&#8208;Adaptive Structure</title>

Complex cube: The family of A2MnII5(CN)12 (A=NEt3Me, NEt2Me2) has a very complex cubic structure. Model&#8208;building and diffraction data revealed an extended 3D cubic motif with adjacent tetrahedral and octahedral MnII sites. Antiferromagnetic coupling between the high&#8208;spin (S=5/2) tetrahedral and low&#8208;spin (S=1/2) octahedral sites is not compensated and leads to ordering as a ferrimagnet.







Abstract
The reactions of MnII(O2CCH3)2 with NEt3Me+CN&#8722; and NEt2Me2+CN&#8722; form (NEt3Me)2MnII5(CN)12 (1) and (NEt2Me2)2MnII5(CN)12 (2), respectively. Structure model&#8208;building and Rietveld refinement of high&#8208;resolution synchrotron powder diffraction data revealed a cubic [a=24.0093&#8197;&#197; (1), 23.8804&#8197;&#197; (2)] 3D extended structural motif with adjacent tetrahedral and octahedral MnII sites in a 3:2 ratio. Each tetrahedral MnII site is surrounded by four low&#8208;spin octahedral MnII sites, and each octahedral MnII site is surrounded by six high&#8208;spin tetrahedral MnII sites; adjacent sites are antiferromagnetically coupled in 3D. Compensation does not occur, and magnetic ordering as a ferrimagnet is observed at Tc=13&#8197;K for 2 based on the temperature at which remnant magnetization, Mr(T)&#8594;0. The hysteresis has an unusual constricted shape with inflection points around 50 and 1.2&#8197;kOe with a 5&#8197;K coercivity of 16&#8197;Oe and remnant magnetization, Mr, of 2050 emuOe&#8201;mol&#8722;1. The unusual structure and stoichiometry are attributed to the very ionic nature of the high&#8208;spin N&#8208;bonded MnII ion, which enables the maximization of the attractive van der Waals interactions through minimization of void space via a reduced &#8736;&#8201;MnNC. This results in an additional example of the AxMnIIy(CN)x+2y (x=0, y=1; x=1, y=3; x=2, y=1; x=2, y=2; x=2, y=3; x=3, y=5; and x=4, y=1) family of compounds possessing an unprecedented stoichiometry and lattice motif that are cation adaptive structured materials.

         <title>Amine Catalysis with Substrates Bearing N&#8208;Heterocyclic Moieties Enabled by Control over the Enamine Pyramidalization Direction</title>

Accommodating N&#8208;heterocycles: The basic and H&#8208;bonding sites of N&#8208;heterocyclic moieties pose a major challenge to organocatalysis. A tailored peptide is introduced as a stereoselective catalyst for conjugate addition reactions with substrates bearing a broad range of N&#8208;heterocyclic moieties. Conformational studies highlight the importance of endo&#8208;pyramidalized enamines for high stereoselectivity.







Abstract
Stereoselective organocatalytic C&#8722;C bond formations that tolerate N&#8208;heterocycles are valuable since these moieties are common motifs in numerous chiral bioactive compounds. Such transformations are, however, challenging since N&#8208;heterocyclic moieties can interfere with the catalytic reaction. Here, we present a peptide that catalyzes conjugate addition reactions between aldehydes and nitroolefins bearing a broad range of different N&#8208;heterocyclic moieties with basic and/or H&#8208;bonding sites in excellent yields and stereoselectivities. Tuning of the pyramidalization direction of the enamine intermediate enabled the high stereoselectivity.

         <title>Aldosterone Glucuronide, an Important Biomarker: Synthesis and Structure Elucidation of Novel Isomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 26, Issue 67, Page 15733-15737, December 1, 2020. </description>

A biomarker: (18R)&#8208;Aldosterone&#8208;18&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucuronide (1) is an important biological marker. A new synthesis is described starting from aldosterone 21&#8208;acetate and the trichloroacetimidate of 2,3,4&#8208;triacetylglucuronic acid methyl ester in the presence of TMSOTf, which is followed by two enzymatic steps. In this process also the novel C&#8208;20&#8208;glucuronides (2) are obtained. The so far unknown stereochemistry at C&#8208;18 in (1) was determined by NOESY experiments.







Abstract
Aldosterone 1 is a mineralocorticoid, it has great influence on the blood pressure and its glucuronide is an important marker for the detection of several diseases. Here, we describe the chemical synthesis of different aldosterone&#8208;18&#8208; and 20&#8208;glucuronides. Reaction of trimethylsilyl 2,3,4&#8208;tri&#8208; acetyl&#8208;1&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glucuronic acid methyl ester 5&#8201;b and aldosterone diacetate 11 in the presence of TMSOTf gave the 18&#8208;&#945;&#8208;glucuronide 9&#8201;a. The 18&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glucuronide 15&#8201;b and the 20&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glucuronide 16&#8201;b could be obtained by reaction of methyl 2,3,4&#8208;tri&#8208;O&#8208;isobutyryl&#8208;1&#945;&#8208;glucuronate trichloroacetimidate 14 and aldosterone 21&#8208;acetate 8 in the presence of TMSOTf or BF3&#8901;OEt2. Finally, reaction of aldosterone 21&#8208;acetate 8 and methyl 2,3,4&#8208;triacetyl&#8208;1&#945;&#8208;glucuronate trichloroacetimidate 19 in the presence of TMSOTf gave the corresponding methyl 18&#8208;&#946;&#8208;triacetylglucuronate 9&#8201;b, which was transformed into the desired aldosterone&#8208;18&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glucuronide 3 by two enzyma&#8208; tic transformations.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Catalysis of Imine Exchange in Dynamic Covalent Systems</title>

         <dc:description>
Hydrogen bond donors, such as thioureas and squaramides, have been shown to catalyze the equilibration of dynamic imine systems under unprecedentedly mild conditions. The catalytic effect takes place in different solvents and in the presence of sensitive additives, leading to rate accelerations for imine metathesis and transimination with amines, hydrazines, and hydroxylamines.







Abstract
The reversibility of imine bonds has been exploited to great effect in the field of dynamic covalent chemistry, with applications such as preparation of functional systems, dynamic materials, molecular machines, and covalent organic frameworks. However, acid catalysis is commonly needed for efficient equilibration of imine mixtures. Herein, it is demonstrated that hydrogen bond donors such as thioureas and squaramides can catalyze the equilibration of dynamic imine systems under unprecedentedly mild conditions. Catalysis occurs in a range of solvents and in the presence of many sensitive additives, showing moderate to good rate accelerations for both imine metathesis and transimination with amines, hydrazines, and hydroxylamines. Furthermore, the catalyst proved simple to immobilize, introducing both reusability and extended control of the equilibration process.

         <title>Rearrangements of Aromatic Nitrile Oxides and Nitrile Ylides: Potential Ring Expansion to Cycloheptatetraene Derivatives Mimicking Arylcarbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 26, Issue 67, Page 15700-15707, December 1, 2020. </description>

Nitrile oxide and nitrile ylide rearrangements: New rearrangements of nitrile oxides 10 (X=O) and nitrile ylides 16 (X=CH2) to cycloheptatetraene derivatives 14 and 21 have been examined at DFT and CASPT2 levels of theory. The ring expansion becomes the preferred path for the triplet state of m,m&#8217;&#8208;bis(dimethylamino)benzonitrile oxide.







Abstract
Nitrile imines, nitrile oxides and nitrile ylides are widely used in 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions. They also undergo thermal and photochemical rearrangements to carbodiimides, isocyanates, and ketenimines, respectively. Calculations at DFT and CASPT2 levels of theory reveal novel, potential rearrangements, in which the aromatic 1,3&#8208;dipoles mimic phenylcarbene and undergo ring expansion to cycloheptatetraene derivatives. These rearrangements can potentially take place in both the singlet ground states and the triplet excited states, and they are accelerated by m,m&#8217;&#8208;bis(dimethylamino) substitution on the phenyl moieties. The new rearrangement becomes the energetically preferred path for m,m&#8217;&#8208;bis(dimethylamino)benzonitrile oxide in the triplet state. In the m,m&#8217;&#8208;bis(dimethylamino)benzo nitrile ylide, the cyclization to the 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1&#8208;azirine is favored over the ring expansion to a cycloheptatetraene by ca. 5&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 in the singlet state. In the bent triplet states, 1,3&#8208;hydrogen shifts interconverting nitrile ylides are potentially possible.

         <title>Configurational and Constitutional Dynamics of Enamine Molecular Switches</title>

         <dc:description>
Dual dynamics of enamine molecular switches is presented. Configurational switching could be rapidly achieved by acid/base where extension of the &#8220;stator&#8221; &#960;&#8208;system provided a higher E&#8208;isomeric equilibrium ratio. Acid&#8208;catalyzed constitutional exchange with primary amines was evaluated, where higher exchange rates were observed with amines containing ester groups. Various acids, particularly BiIII, were found to efficiently catalyze the dynamic processes.







Abstract
Dual configurational and constitutional dynamics in systems based on enamine molecular switches has been systematically studied. pH&#8208;responsive moieties, such as 2&#8208;pyridyl and 2&#8208;quinolinyl units, were required on the &#8222;stator&#8220; part, also providing enamine stability through intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding (IMHB) effects. Upon protonation or deprotonation, forward and backward switching could be rapidly achieved. Extension of the stator &#960;&#8208;system in the 2&#8208;quinolinyl derivative provided a higher E&#8208;isomeric equilibrium ratio under neutral conditions, pointing to a means to achieve quantitative forward/backward isomerization processes. The &#8222;rotor&#8220; part of the enamine switches exhibited constitutional exchange ability with primary amines. Interestingly, considerably higher exchange rates were observed with amines containing ester groups, indicating potential stabilization of the transition state through IMHB. Acids, particularly BiIII, were found to efficiently catalyze the constitutional dynamic processes. In contrast, the enamine and the formed dynamic enamine system showed excellent stability under basic conditions. This coupled configurational and constitutional dynamics expands the scope of dynamic C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bonds and potentiates further studies and applications in the fields of molecular machinery and systems chemistry.

Sky&#8208;blue emissive arylgold(III)&#8208;TADF (thermally activated delayed fluorescence) complexes with emission maxima at 470&#8211;484&#8197;nm, &#934; of up to 82&#8201;% and &#964; &lt; 1&#8197;&#956;s were successfully developed through a strategic consideration of substituent effects on the pincer C^N^C ligands and triphenylamine donor. Sky&#8208;blue emitting OLEDs have been achieved with these gold(III)&#8208;TADF emitters, showing high EQEs of up to 15.25&#8201;%, narrow&#8208;band emission and good color purity with CIE coordinates of (0.16, 0.23).







Abstract
Highly efficient sky&#8208;blue luminescent gold(III) complexes with emission quantum yields up to 82&#8201;%, lifetimes down to 0.67&#8197;&#956;s and emission peak maxima at 470&#8211;484&#8197;nm were prepared through a consideration of pincer gold(III) donor&#8211;acceptor complexes. Photophysical studies and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations revealed that the emission nature of these gold(III) complexes is most consistent with TADF. Solution&#8208;processed OLEDs with these gold(III) complexes as dopants afforded electroluminescence maxima at 465&#8211;473&#8197;nm with FWHM of 64&#8211;67&#8197;nm and maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of up to 15.25&#8201;%. This research demonstrates the first example of gold(III)&#8208;OLEDs showing electroluminescence maxima at smaller than 470&#8197;nm, and highlights the potential of using gold(III)&#8208;TADF emitters in the development of high efficiency blue OLEDs and blue emissive dopant in WOLEDs.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sky&#8208;blue emissive&lt;/b&gt; arylgold(III)&#8208;TADF (thermally activated delayed fluorescence) complexes with emission maxima at 470&#8211;484&#8197;nm, &lt;i&gt;&#934;&lt;/i&gt; of up to 82&#8201;% and &lt;i&gt;&#964;&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 1&#8197;&#956;s were successfully developed through a strategic consideration of substituent effects on the pincer C^N^C ligands and triphenylamine donor. Sky&#8208;blue emitting OLEDs have been achieved with these gold(III)&#8208;TADF emitters, showing high EQEs of up to 15.25&#8201;%, narrow&#8208;band emission and good color purity with CIE coordinates of (0.16, 0.23).

         <title>Understanding the Uniqueness of 2p Elements in Periodic Tables</title>

2p or not 2p? Similarity of radii (and energies) of the atomic valence orbitals is the precondition for hybridization and hybrid bonding. In the Coulomb potential of H&#8208;like atoms, the 2p orbital without a radial node is much smaller than 2s (2s&#8811;2p), whereas higher p orbitals are comparably less contracted (ns&#8819;np). The screening of nuclear attraction by the core shells is more effective for the core penetrating s orbitals, so that for the valence orbital radii of ordinary many&#8208;electron atoms of the 2nd row, 2s&#8776;2p, whereas in rows n&gt;2, hybridization is less pronounced owing, i.a., to ns&#8810;np.







Abstract
The Periodic Table, and the unique chemical behavior of the first element in a column (group), were discovered simultaneously one and a half centuries ago. Half a century ago, this unique chemistry of the light homologs was correlated to the then available atomic orbital (AO) radii. The radially nodeless 1s, 2p, 3d, 4f valence AOs are particularly compact. The similarity of r(2s)&#8776;r(2p) leads to pronounced sp&#8208;hybrid bonding of the light p&#8208;block elements, whereas the heavier p elements with n&#8805;3 exhibit r(ns) &#8810; r(np) of approximately &#8722;20 to &#8722;30&#8201;%. Herein, a comprehensive physical explanation is presented in terms of kinetic radial and angular, as well as potential nuclear&#8208;attraction and electron&#8208;screening effects. For hydrogen&#8208;like atoms and all inner shells of the heavy atoms, r(2s) &#8811; r(2p) by +20 to +30&#8201;%, whereas r(3s)&#8819;r(3p)&#8819;r(3d), since in Coulomb potentials radial motion is more radial orbital expanding than angular motion. However, the screening of nuclear attraction by inner core shells is more efficient for s than for p valence shells. The uniqueness of the 2p AO is explained by this differential shielding. Thereby, the present work paves the way for future physical explanations of the 3d, 4f, and 5g cases.

         <title>N&#8208;Rich Porous Polymer with Isolated Tb3+&#8208;Ions Displays Unique Temperature Dependent Behavior through the Absence of Thermal Quenching</title>

A novel bipyridine&#8208;based porous organic polymer (bpyDAT POP) is investigated as temperature sensor after grafting with Eu(acac)3 and Tb(acac)3 complexes. The material successfully demonstrates the potential of amorphous, porous polymers in temperature sensing. Furthermore, peculiar temperature dependent behavior is observed through the interruption of conjugation in the framework and the absence of thermal quenching.







Abstract
The challenge of measuring fast moving or small scale samples is based on the absence of contact between sample and sensor. Grafting lanthanides onto hybrid materials arises as one of the most promising accurate techniques to obtain noninvasive thermometers. In this work, a novel bipyridine based porous organic polymer (bpyDAT POP) was investigated as temperature sensor after grafting with Eu(acac)3 and Tb(acac)3 complexes. The bpyDAT POP successfully showed temperature&#8208;dependent behavior in the 10&#8211;310&#8197;K range, proving the potential of amorphous, porous organic frameworks. We observed unique temperature dependent behavior. More intriguingly, instead of the standard observed change in emission as a result of a change in temperature for both Eu3+ and Tb3+, the emission spectrum of Tb3+ remained constant. This work provides framework&#8208; and energy&#8208;based explanations for the observed phenomenon. The conjugation in the bpyDAT POP framework is interrupted, creating energetically isolated Tb3+ environments. Energy transfer from Tb3+ to Eu3+ is therefore absent, nor energy back transfer from Tb3+ to bpyDAT POP ligand (i.e. no thermal quenching) is detected.

Triplet ketone Catalysis. A simple triplet ketone catalysis, generated by household visible light bulb irradiation, open up a vinylation path with sp3&#8208;C&#8722;H substrate whereas dehalogenation takes place with bromoalkyne provided alkyne products. This methodology allows selective intermolecular C&#8722;C bond formation.







Abstract
An unprecedented direct atom&#8208;economic chemo&#8208; and regioselective hydroalkylation of chloroalkynes and an sp3&#8208;C&#8722;H alkynylation of bromoalkynes was achieved. The reaction partners are unfunctionalized ethers, alcohols, amides, and even non&#8208;activated hydrocarbons. We found that a household fluorescent bulb was able to excite a diaryl ketone, which then selectively abstracts a H&#8208;atom from an sp3&#8208;C&#8722;H bond. The product of a formal alkyne insertion into the sp3&#8208;C&#8722;H bond was obtained with chloroalkynes, providing valuable vinyl chlorides. The photo&#8208;organocatalytic hydrogen atom transfer strategy gives rise to a broad range of diversely functionalized olefins. When bromoalkynes are applied in the presence of a base, a chemoselectivity switch to an alkynylation is observed. This reaction can even be performed for the alkynylation of unactivated sp3&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds, in this case with a preference of the more substituted carbon. Accompanying quantum chemical calculations indicate a vinyl radical intermediate with pronounced linear coordination of the carbon radical center, thus enabling the formation of both diastereoisomers after H&#8208;atom abstraction, suggesting that the (Z)&#8208;diastereoisomer is preferred, which supports the experimentally observed (E/Z)&#8208;distribution.

Golden touch: A cationic organometallic gold(I) complex featuring N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands and endowed with selective anticancer activity towards human ovarian A2780 cancer cells was studied using an integrated investigational approach, including shotgun proteomics, mass spectrometry and pharmacological methods. The obtained results suggest a multimodal activity related to actin stress fibres, Nrf2&#8208;mediated redox response and telomere disturbance.







Abstract
The organometallic AuI bis&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complex [Au(9&#8208;methylcaffeine&#8208;8&#8208;ylidene)2]+ (AuTMX2) was previously shown to selectively and potently stabilise telomeric DNA G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structures. This study sheds light on the molecular reactivity and mode of action of AuTMX2 in the cellular context using mass spectrometry&#8208;based methods, including shotgun proteomics in A2780 ovarian cancer cells. In contrast to other metal&#8208;based anticancer agents, this organogold compound is less prone to form coordinative bonds with biological nucleophiles and is expected to exert its drug effects mainly by non&#8208;covalent interactions. Global protein expression changes of treated cancer cells revealed a multimodal mode of action of AuTMX2 by alterations in the nucleolus, telomeres, actin stress&#8208;fibres and stress&#8208;responses, which were further supported by pharmacological assays, fluorescence microscopy and cellular accumulation experiments. Proteomic data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD020560.

         <title>Dynamic Helicates Self&#8208;Assembly from Homo&#8208; and Heterotopic Dynamic Covalent Ligand Strands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 26, Issue 67, Page 15664-15671, December 1, 2020. </description>

Keep it dynamic: The dynamic nature of the helical systems offers an additional level of complexity by combining self&#8208;sorting on two levels: 1)&#8197;the build&#8208;up of the ligand strand constituents from their components through dynamic covalent chemistry; 2)&#8197;the assembly of the helicates from the ligands and the metal cations through dynamic metallo&#8208;supramolecular chemistry.







Abstract
The understanding and the application of reversible covalent reactions and coordination chemistry together with the proper design of the molecular frameworks, allow to achieve not only well&#8208;defined output architectures but also different grades of complex behavior. In this work, the dynamic nature of the helical systems offers an additional level of complexity by combining self&#8208;sorting on two levels: 1)&#8197;the build&#8208;up of the ligand strand constituents from their components through dynamic covalent chemistry; 2)&#8197;the assembly of the helicates from the ligands and the metal cations through dynamic metallo&#8208;supramolecular chemistry. The information encoded in the ligands constituent molecule was read differently (and accurately at the same time) by metal cations that varied in the coordination algorithms. It enabled the selective formation of a specific type of helicates from a wide library of helicates formed by the possible combination of subcomponents. Ligands containing dynamic tridentate and/or bidentate binding motifs in the same strand were studied to explore the helicates self&#8208;assembly with appropriate metal cations.

         <title>A Mechanistic Study of the Multiple Roles of Oleic Acid in the Oil&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Pt Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 26, Issue 67, Page 15636-15642, December 1, 2020. </description>

A set of experiments were conducted to elucidate the roles played by oleic acid (OAc) at different stages in the formation of Pt nanocrystals using a simple protocol that only involved heating Pt(acac)2 in OAc.







Abstract
Oleic acid (OAc) is commonly used as a surfactant and/or solvent for the oil&#8208;phase synthesis of metal nanocrystals but its explicit roles are yet to be resolved. Here, we report a systematic study of this problem by focusing on a synthesis that simply involves heating of Pt(acac)2 in OAc for the generation of Pt nanocrystals. When heated at 80&#8201;&#176;C, the ligand exchange between Pt(acac)2 and OAc leads to the formation of a PtII&#8211;oleate complex that serves as the actual precursor to Pt atoms. Upon increasing the temperature to 120&#8201;&#176;C, the decarbonylation of OAc produces CO, which can act as a reducing agent for the generation of Pt atoms and thus formation of nuclei. Afterwards, several catalytic reactions can take place on the surface of the Pt nuclei to produce more CO, which also serves as a capping agent for the formation of Pt nanocrystals enclosed by {100} facets. The emergence of Pt nanocrystals further promotes the autocatalytic surface reduction of PtII precursor to enable the continuation of growth. This work not only elucidates the critical roles of OAc at different stages in a synthesis of Pt nanocrystals, but also represents a pivotal step forward toward the rational synthesis of metal nanocrystals.

Double&#8208;helical diradicaloid: A new S&#8208;shaped para&#8208;quinodimethane&#8208;embedded double [6]helicene shows unique open&#8208;shell diradical character. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis shows that it has a double helical structure in the crystal, with the two terminal [6]helicene units bent in opposite directions. Furthermore, an anti/syn isomerization process was observed on the NMR timescale with a moderate interconversion energy barrier. The dication and dianion of 1 also show open&#8208;shell diradical character with small singlet&#8211;triplet energy gaps.







Abstract
Helicenes and extended helical &#960;&#8208;conjugated compounds have been widely studied, but most of the systems contain only aromatic benzene or heterocyclic rings, showing local aromatic character. Herein, new S&#8208;shaped double [6]helicene 1, which has two embedded para&#8208;quinodimethane (p&#8208;QDM) units, is reported. Due to the existence of a proaromatic quinoidal substructure, it has open&#8208;shell diradical character. Its model compound, C&#8208;shaped single [6]helicene 2 containing one p&#8208;QDM unit, was also synthesized and compared. Their ground&#8208;state structures and electronic properties were systematically studied by a combination of various experimental methods assisted by theoretical calculations. Compound 1 has a double&#8208;helical structure in the crystal, with the two terminal [6]helicene units bent in opposite directions (i.e., anti form). However, an anti/syn isomerization process with a moderate interconversion energy barrier was observed on the NMR timescale. Compound 1 shows amphoteric redox behavior. It also exhibits open&#8208;shell diradical character (y0=12.1&#8201;%) and a small singlet&#8211;triplet gap. On the other hand, compound 2 has a typical closed&#8208;shell nature. The dication and dianion of 1 also show open&#8208;shell diradical character. The dianion of 2 and the tetraanion of 1 exhibit similar electronic structures to their respective isoelectronic structures, that is, [6]helicene and a double [6]helicene. This work provides some insights into the design and synthesis of stable helical &#960; systems with open&#8208;shell diradical character and magnetic activity.

Couple up: Mass spectrometry insight into the M/NHC&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reaction resulted in the discovery of NHC&#8208;ethynyl coupling process. Intermediates of this transformations and 2&#8208;ethynylated azolium cations were studied with NMR, ESI&#8208;MS, CID, IRMPD, DFT and MD techniques.







Abstract
The product of a revealed transformation&#8212;NHC&#8208;ethynyl coupling&#8212;was observed as a catalyst transformation pathway in the Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling, catalyzed by Pd/NHC complexes. The 2&#8208;ethynylated azolium salt was isolated in individual form and fully characterized, including X&#8208;ray analysis. A number of possible intermediates of this transformation with common formulae (NHC)nPd(C2Ph) (n=1,2) were observed and subjected to collision&#8208;induced dissociation (CID) and infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD) experiments to elucidate their structure. Measured bond dissociation energies (BDEs) and IRMPD spectra were in an excellent agreement with quantum calculations for coupling product &#960;&#8208;complexes with Pd0. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed the observed multiple CID fragmentation pathways. An unconventional methodology to study catalyst evolution suggests the reported transformation to be considered in the development of new catalytic systems for alkyne functionalization reactions.

         <title>Mono&#8208; and Di&#8208;Fucosylated Glycans of the Parasitic Worm S.&#8201;mansoni are Recognized Differently by the Innate Immune Receptor DC&#8208;SIGN</title>

         <dc:description>
Chemically synthesized oligosaccharides derived from the parasite worm S. mansoni made it possible to investigate by a combination of analytical techniques molecular interactions with the innate immune receptor DC&#8208;SIGN. It showed that by further fucosylation of antigens such as LDN&#8208;NF, detection by DC&#8208;SIGN is prevented, which in turn may be important for shaping immune responses during different phases of the life cycle of the parasite.







Abstract
The parasitic worm, Schistosoma mansoni, expresses unusual fucosylated glycans in a stage&#8208;dependent manner that can be recognized by the human innate immune receptor DC&#8208;SIGN, thereby shaping host immune responses. We have developed a synthetic approach for mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;fucosylated LacdiNAc (LDN&#8208;F and LDN&#8208;DF, respectively), which are epitopes expressed on glycolipids and glycoproteins of S. mansoni. It is based on the use of monosaccharide building blocks having carefully selected amino&#8208;protecting groups, facilitating high yielding and stereoselective glycosylations. The molecular interaction between the synthetic glycans and DC&#8208;SIGN was studied by NMR and molecular modeling, which demonstrated that the &#945;1,3&#8208;fucoside of LDN&#8208;F can coordinate with the Ca2+&#8208;ion of the canonical binding site of DC&#8208;SIGN allowing for additional interactions with the underlying LDN backbone. The 1,2&#8208;fucoside of LDN&#8208;DF can be complexed in a similar manner, however, in this binding mode GlcNAc and GalNAc of the LDN backbone are placed away from the protein surface resulting in a substantially lower binding affinity. Glycan microarray binding studies showed that the avidity and selectivity of binding is greatly enhanced when the glycans are presented multivalently, and in this format Lex and LDN&#8208;F gave strong responsiveness, whereas no binding was detected for LDN&#8208;DF. The data indicates that S. mansoni has developed a strategy to avoid detection by DC&#8208;SIGN in a stage&#8208;dependent manner by the addition of a fucoside to a number of its ligands.

         <title>Insights on the Pseudo&#8208;Enantiomeric Properties of Bifunctional Cinchona Alkaloid Squaramide&#8208;Derived Organocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 26, Issue 67, Page 15727-15732, December 1, 2020. </description>

Old catalyst, new trick: The active site of a widely adopted cinchona alkaloid squaramide&#8208;derived organocatalyst has been shown to exist in an either pro&#8208;S or pro&#8208;R&#8208;configuration using density functional theory. The pseudo&#8208;enantiomeric forms of the catalyst provide conformations of reverse chirality that produce opposite enantiomers.







Abstract
The use of pseudo enantiomers is a well&#8208;known method of achieving products of complementary stereochemistry. Only rarely can different enantiomers of a product be accessed without modulation of the catalyst. Recently, a system was reported wherein two different enantiomers of spirocycles were obtained by a cascade reaction of unsaturated pyrrolin&#8208;4&#8208;ones with mercaptoacetaldehyde catalyzed by a single optimized cinchona alkaloid squaramide&#8208;derived organocatalyst. It was originally proposed that the E/Z geometry of the unsaturated pyrrolin&#8208;4&#8208;one dictated the stereochemistry of the spirocycle product, but this was not investigated further. In the present work, we have investigated the nature of a pseudo&#8208;enantiomeric organocatalyst conformation applying density functional theory calculations for investigating the transition states for the reaction. Furthermore, the influence of the double&#8208;bond geometry of the pyrrolin&#8208;4&#8208;one has been studied beyond what is possible to test experimentally. The results provide a greater understanding for this class of reactions that may be applicable in future methodology development.

         <title>A State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;Art Heterogeneous Catalyst for Efficient and General Nitrile Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 26, Issue 67, Page 15589-15595, December 1, 2020. </description>

Mild at heart: A nanostructured catalytic material composed by cobalt nanoparticles, magnesium oxide and a biowaste&#8208;derived carbon matrix is able to efficiently mediate the hydrogenation of nitriles. Not only the mild operative conditions are of note, but also the remarkable selectivity towards primary amines. This allows the preparation of a large array of molecules in high yields even under scaled&#8208;up conditions.







Abstract
Cobalt&#8208;doped hybrid materials consisting of metal oxides and carbon derived from chitin were prepared, characterized and tested for industrially relevant nitrile hydrogenations. The optimal catalyst supported onto MgO showed, after pyrolysis at 700&#8201;&#176;C, magnesium oxide nanocubes decorated with carbon&#8208;enveloped Co nanoparticles. This special structure allows for the selective hydrogenation of diverse and demanding nitriles to the corresponding primary amines under mild conditions (e.g. 70&#8201;&#176;C, 20&#8197;bar H2). The advantage of this novel catalytic material is showcased for industrially important substrates, including adipodinitrile, picolinonitrile, and fatty acid nitriles.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mild at heart&lt;/b&gt;: A nanostructured catalytic material composed by cobalt nanoparticles, magnesium oxide and a biowaste&#8208;derived carbon matrix is able to efficiently mediate the hydrogenation of nitriles. Not only the mild operative conditions are of note, but also the remarkable selectivity towards primary amines. This allows the preparation of a large array of molecules in high yields even under scaled&#8208;up conditions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cobalt&#8208;doped hybrid materials consisting of metal oxides and carbon derived from chitin were prepared, characterized and tested for industrially relevant nitrile hydrogenations. The optimal catalyst supported onto MgO showed, after pyrolysis at 700&#8201;&#176;C, magnesium oxide nanocubes decorated with carbon&#8208;enveloped Co nanoparticles. This special structure allows for the selective hydrogenation of diverse and demanding nitriles to the corresponding primary amines under mild conditions (e.g. 70&#8201;&#176;C, 20&#8197;bar H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The advantage of this novel catalytic material is showcased for industrially important substrates, including adipodinitrile, picolinonitrile, and fatty acid nitriles. Notably, the developed system outperformed all other tested commercial catalysts, for example, Raney Nickel and even noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based systems in these transformations.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Inherent Impurities in Graphene/Polylactic Acid Filament Strongly Influence on the Capacitive Performance of 3D&#8208;Printed Electrode</title>

Positive impurities: Inherent impurities, TiO2 and Fe3O4 were found in commercial conductive graphene/PLA filaments used in the printing of 3D&#8208;electrodes by a fused deposition modeling technique. These additives contributed towards pseudocapacitive charge storage kinetics of the 3D&#8208;printed electrodes and dramatically enhanced the overall capacitance.







Abstract
Additive manufacturing or 3D&#8208;printing have become promising fabrication techniques in the field of electrochemical energy storage applications such as supercapacitors, and batteries. Of late, a commercially available graphene/polylactic acid (PLA) filament has been commonly used for Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D&#8208;printing in the fabrication of electrodes for supercapacitors and Li&#8208;ion batteries. This graphene/PLA filament contains metal&#8208;based impurities such as titanium oxide and iron oxide. In this study, we show a strong influence of inherent impurities in the graphene/PLA filament for supercapacitor applications. A 3D&#8208;printed electrode is prepared and subsequently thermally activated for electrochemical measurement. A deep insight has been taken to look into the pseudocapacitive contribution from the metal&#8208;based impurities which significantly enhanced the overall capacitance of the 3D&#8208;printed graphene/PLA electrode. A systematic approach has been shown to remove the impurities from the printed electrodes. This has a broad implication on the interpretation of the capacitance of 3D&#8208;printed composites.

         <title>The Weak 3D Topological Insulator Bi12Rh3Sn3I9</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 26, Issue 67, Page 15549-15557, December 1, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insulating: Bi12Rh3Sn3I9, a weak 3D topological insulator (TI) is derived from Bi14Rh3I9, which was the first weakly coupling (&#8220;weak&#8221;) 3D TI; a bulk semiconductor that hosts protected electronic surface states that allow dissipation&#8208;free electron and information transport due to the specific symmetries of its electronic band structure. In consequence of their topological properties, TIs are envisioned as promising candidates for high&#8208;performance spin field&#8208;effect transistors and quantum bits.







Abstract
Topological insulators (TIs) gained high interest due to their protected electronic surface states that allow dissipation&#8208;free electron and information transport. In consequence, TIs are recommended as materials for spintronics and quantum computing. Yet, the number of well&#8208;characterized TIs is rather limited. To contribute to this field of research, we focused on new bismuth&#8208;based subiodides and recently succeeded in synthesizing a new compound Bi12Rh3Sn3I9, which is structurally closely related to Bi14Rh3I9 &#8211; a stable, layered material. In fact, Bi14Rh3I9 is the first experimentally supported weak 3D TI. Both structures are composed of well&#8208;defined intermetallic layers of &#8734;2[(Bi4Rh)3I]2+ with topologically protected electronic edge&#8208;states. The fundamental difference between Bi14Rh3I9 and Bi12Rh3Sn3I9 lies in the composition and the arrangement of the anionic spacer. While the intermetallic 2D TI layers in Bi14Rh3I9 are isolated by &#8734;1[Bi2I8]2&#8722; chains, the isoelectronic substitution of bismuth(III) with tin(II) leads to &#8734;2[Sn3I8]2&#8722; layers as anionic spacers. First transport experiments support the 2D character of this material class and revealed metallic conductivity.

A truly heterogeneous photocatalyst: Defect engineering in metal&#8208;organic frameworks is commonly performed with thermal or chemical treatments. We show that oxygen plasma treatment generates structural defects on MIL&#8208;125(Ti)&#8208;NH2, leading to an increase in its photocatalytic activity. Characterization data indicate that plasma&#8208;treated materials retain most of their initial crystallinity while exhibiting somewhat lower surface area and pore volume.







Abstract
Defect engineering in metal&#8208;organic frameworks is commonly performed by using thermal or chemical treatments. Herein we report that oxygen plasma treatment generates structural defects on MIL&#8208;125(Ti)&#8208;NH2, leading to an increase in its photocatalytic activity. Characterization data indicate that plasma&#8208;treated materials retain most of their initial crystallinity, while exhibiting somewhat lower surface area and pore volume. XPS and FT&#8208;IR spectroscopy reveal that oxygen plasma induces MIL&#8208;125(Ti)&#8208;NH2 partial terephthalate decarboxylation and an increase in the Ti&#8208;OH population. Thermogravimetric analyses confirm the generation of structural defects by oxygen plasma and allowed an estimation of the resulting experimental formula of the treated MIL&#8208;125(Ti)&#8208;NH2 solids. SEM analyses show that oxygen plasma treatment of MIL&#8208;125(Ti)&#8208;NH2 gradually decreases its particle size. Importantly, diffuse reflectance UV/Vis spectroscopy and valence band measurements demonstrate that oxygen plasma treatment alters the MIL&#8208;125(Ti)&#8208;NH2 band gap and, more significantly, the alignment of highest occupied and lowest unoccupied crystal orbitals. An optimal oxygen plasma treatment to achieve the highest efficiency in water splitting with or without methanol as sacrificial electron donor under UV/Vis or simulated sunlight was determined. The optimized plasma&#8208;treated MIL&#8208;125(Ti)&#8208;NH2 photocatalyst acts as a truly heterogeneous photocatalyst and retains most of its initial photoactivity and crystallinity upon reuse.

         <title>The Nature of Nonclassical Carbonyl Ligands Explained by&#8201;Kohn&#8211;Sham Molecular Orbital Theory</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 26, Issue 67, Page 15690-15699, December 1, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Classical or nonclassical? We show that there are two competing forces that affect the CO bond length in transition metal complexes, namely electrostatic interactions (favoring CO contraction) and &#960;&#8208;back&#8208;donation (favoring CO expansion). The origin is elucidated by quantitative MO&#8208;theory, leading to new insights into the driving forces behind nonclassical behavior.







Abstract
When carbonyl ligands coordinate to transition metals, their bond distance either increases (classical) or decreases (nonclassical) with respect to the bond length in the isolated CO molecule. C&#8722;O expansion can easily be understood by &#960;&#8208;back&#8208;donation, which results in a population of the CO's &#960;*&#8208;antibonding orbital and hence a weakening of its bond. Nonclassical carbonyl ligands are less straightforward to explain, and their nature is still subject of an ongoing debate. In this work, we studied five isoelectronic octahedral complexes, namely Fe(CO)62+, Mn(CO)6+, Cr(CO)6, V(CO)6&#8722; and Ti(CO)62&#8722;, at the ZORA&#8208;BLYP/TZ2P level of theory to explain this nonclassical behavior in the framework of Kohn&#8211;Sham molecular orbital theory. We show that there are two competing forces that affect the C&#8722;O bond length, namely electrostatic interactions (favoring C&#8722;O contraction) and &#960;&#8208;back&#8208;donation (favoring C&#8722;O expansion). It is a balance between those two terms that determines whether the carbonyl is classical or nonclassical. By further decomposing the electrostatic interaction &#916;Velstat into four fundamental terms, we are able to rationalize why &#916;Velstat gives rise to the nonclassical behavior, leading to new insights into the driving forces behind C&#8722;O contraction.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Classical or nonclassical?&lt;/b&gt; We show that there are two competing forces that affect the CO bond length in transition metal complexes, namely electrostatic interactions (favoring CO contraction) and &#960;&#8208;back&#8208;donation (favoring CO expansion). The origin is elucidated by quantitative MO&#8208;theory, leading to new insights into the driving forces behind nonclassical behavior.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When carbonyl ligands coordinate to transition metals, their bond distance either increases (classical) or decreases (nonclassical) with respect to the bond length in the isolated CO molecule. C&#8722;O expansion can easily be understood by &#960;&#8208;back&#8208;donation, which results in a population of the CO's &#960;*&#8208;antibonding orbital and hence a weakening of its bond. Nonclassical carbonyl ligands are less straightforward to explain, and their nature is still subject of an ongoing debate. In this work, we studied five isoelectronic octahedral complexes, namely Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Mn(CO)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cr(CO)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, V(CO)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and Ti(CO)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, at the ZORA&#8208;BLYP/TZ2P level of theory to explain this nonclassical behavior in the framework of Kohn&#8211;Sham molecular orbital theory. We show that there are two competing forces that affect the C&#8722;O bond length, namely electrostatic interactions (favoring C&#8722;O contraction) and &#960;&#8208;back&#8208;donation (favoring C&#8722;O expansion). It is a balance between those two terms that determines whether the carbonyl is classical or nonclassical. By further decomposing the electrostatic interaction &#916;&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;elstat&lt;/sub&gt; into four fundamental terms, we are able to rationalize why &#916;&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;elstat&lt;/sub&gt; gives rise to the nonclassical behavior, leading to new insights into the driving forces behind C&#8722;O contraction.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Computational Analysis of Mesomerism in para&#8208;Substituted mer&#8208;NCN Pincer Platinum(II) Complexes, Including its Relationships with Hammett &#963;p Substituent Parameters</title>

Mesomerism in PtII pincer systems is probed by computational methods in combination with relationships between DFT data and the Hammett substituent parameter &#963;p. Electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents at the para&#8208;position enhance &#960;&#8208;interaction of the Pt 5dyz orbital with the arene. Model studies allow determination of relative substituent parameters for (CH2NMe2)2PtZ that are consistent with the orbital analysis of mesomerism, NMR studies and an experimentally estimated value for Z=I.







Abstract
Density Functional Theory studies of square&#8208;planar PtII pincer structures, (4&#8208;Z&#8208;NCN)PtCl ([4&#8208;Z&#8208;NCN]&#8722;=[4&#8208;Z&#8208;2,6&#8208;(Me2NCH2)2C6H2&#8208;N,C,N]&#8722;, Z=H, NO2, CF3, CO2H, CHO, Cl, Br, I, F, SMe, SiMe3, tBu, OH, NH2, NMe2), enable characterisation of mesomerism for the pincer&#8208;Pt interaction. Relationships between Hammett &#963;p substituent parameters of Z and DFT data obtained from NBO6 and AOMix computation are used to probe the interaction of the 5dyz orbital of platinum with &#960;&#8208;orbitals of the arene ring. Analogous computation for 2,6&#8208;(Me2CH2)2C6H3Z (Z=H, CF3, CHO, Cl, Br, I, F, SMe, SiMe3, tBu, OH, NH2) and (4&#8208;H&#8208;NCN)PtZ allows an estimation of the relative substituent effects of &#8220;(CH2NMe2)2PtZ&#8221; on &#960;&#8208;delocalisation in the pincer system.

         <title>Unravelling the Time Scale of Conformational Plasticity and Allostery in Glycan Recognition by Human Galectin&#8208;1</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 26, Issue 67, Page 15643-15653, December 1, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
What's the time? A multidisciplinary approach based on NMR experiments (ligand&#8208;based and receptor&#8208;based, CLEANEX, and relaxation dispersion), assisted by microseconds molecular dynamics simulations has been used to demonstrate that human galectin&#8208;1 recognizes similar glycan epitopes with different dynamic features. The highest affinity ligand induces allosterism throughout the whole protein structure, manifested by motions at residues far from the binding site.







Abstract
The interaction of human galectin&#8208;1 with a variety of oligosaccharides, from di&#8208;(N&#8208;acetyllactosamine) to tetra&#8208;saccharides (blood B type&#8208;II antigen) has been scrutinized by using a combined approach of different NMR experiments, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and isothermal titration calorimetry. Ligand&#8208; and receptor&#8208;based NMR experiments assisted by computational methods allowed proposing three&#8208;dimensional structures for the different complexes, which explained the lack of enthalpy gain when increasing the chemical complexity of the glycan. Interestingly, and independently of the glycan ligand, the entropy term does not oppose the binding event, a rather unusual feature for protein&#8208;sugar interactions. CLEANEX&#8208;PM and relaxation dispersion experiments revealed that sugar binding affected residues far from the binding site and described significant changes in the dynamics of the protein. In particular, motions in the microsecond&#8208;millisecond timescale in residues at the protein dimer interface were identified in the presence of high affinity ligands. The dynamic process was further explored by extensive MD simulations, which provided additional support for the existence of allostery in glycan recognition by human galectin&#8208;1.

Abstract

The optimised procedure does not require column chromatography in any step and allows for preparation of up to 0.5&#8197;kg batches of the catalyst from simple precursors. The application profile of the obtained catalyst was studied in environmentally friendly dimethyl carbonate (DMC). Although VII exhibited low efficiency in cross&#8208;metathesis (CM) with electron&#8208;deficient partners, good to excellent results were noted for substrates featuring easy to isomerise C&#8722;C double bonds. This includes polyfunctional substrates of medicinal chemistry interest, such as analogues of psychoactive 5F&#8208;PB&#8208;22 and NM&#8208;2201 and two PDE5 inhibitors&#8212;Sildenafil and Vardenafil. Finally, a larger scale ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM) of a Vardenafil derivative was conducted in DMC, allowing for straightforward isolation of the expected product (23&#8197;g) in high yield and with low Ru contamination level (7.7&#8197;ppm).

         <title>A Unified Framework for Understanding Nucleophilicity and Protophilicity in the SN2/E2 Competition</title>

It's about time! A transparent and physically sound model is proposed to recognize when a Lewis base will react as a nucleophile (SN2) or protophile (E2) and the novel concepts of &#8220;characteristic distortivity&#8221; and &#8220;transition state acidity&#8221; are introduced.







Abstract
The concepts of nucleophilicity and protophilicity are fundamental and ubiquitous in chemistry. A case in point is bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2) and base&#8208;induced elimination (E2). A Lewis base acting as a strong nucleophile is needed for SN2 reactions, whereas a Lewis base acting as a strong protophile (i.e., base) is required for E2 reactions. A complicating factor is, however, the fact that a good nucleophile is often a strong protophile. Nevertheless, a sound, physical model that explains, in a transparent manner, when an electron&#8208;rich Lewis base acts as a protophile or a nucleophile, which is not just phenomenological, is currently lacking in the literature. To address this fundamental question, the potential energy surfaces of the SN2 and E2 reactions of X&#8722;+C2H5Y model systems with X, Y = F, Cl, Br, I, and At, are explored by using relativistic density functional theory at ZORA&#8208;OLYP/TZ2P. These explorations have yielded a consistent overview of reactivity trends over a wide range in reactivity and pathways. Activation strain analyses of these reactions reveal the factors that determine the shape of the potential energy surfaces and hence govern the propensity of the Lewis base to act as a nucleophile or protophile. The concepts of &#8220;characteristic distortivity&#8221; and &#8220;transition state acidity&#8221; of a reaction are introduced, which have the potential to enable chemists to better understand and design reactions for synthesis.

         <title>Electrophilic and Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitutions are Mechanistically Similar with Opposite Polarity</title>

Oranges and lemons: The analogy between the mechanisms of electrophilic and nucleophilic aromatic substitution is discussed and supported by several synthetic examples. These important processes are in an Umpolung relationship.







Abstract
Confrontation of the recently formulated general mechanism of nucleophilic substitution in electron&#8208;deficient arenes with the well&#8208;known mechanism of electrophilic substitution revealed that these fundamental processes are mechanistically identical but proceed according to opposite polarity&#8212;an Umpolung relation. In this viewpoint this apparently controversial concept is supported by discussion of a variety of experimental results.

After 1000 issues of the journal, our Editorial Board Chairs share their views on the past, present and future of Chemistry&#8212;A European Journal. The success of the journal is associated with the creativity and the work of its authors. Like all great journals there is increasing involvement of Asia and the Americas, too, in addition to the ongoing strengths of European chemistry. While the Journal tends to emphasize the fundamental research of the chemistry being published, some of the cutting&#8208;edge contributions also have an applied nature that underpins the industrial innovation of society.

Research on topological insulators (TIs) has rapidly progressed, notably owing to their intriguing physical properties. These materials are bulk semiconductors but host protected metallic surface states. As shown in the cover artwork, the spins of the electrons in these states are locked orthogonally to their propagation direction. Specific symmetries of the electronic band structure allow dissipation&#8208;free electron and information transport. Therefore, they are envisioned as promising candidates in the development of high&#8208;performance spin field&#8208;effect transistors and quantum bits. More information can be found in the Full Paper by M. Ruck et&#8197;al. on page 15549.

The 2p elements exhibit chemistries qualitatively different from their heavier congeners. The physical origin is the quantitative interplay of electronic, kinetic, and potential energies: The 2p orbital has no radial node and therefore little radial kinetic energy, thus 2p is radially rather contracted. All ns orbitals are weakly shielded from nuclear attraction in many&#8208;electronic atoms, thus all ns&#8208;orbitals are radially contracted. Therefore r2s/r2p&#8776;1 for n=2 supporting sp&#8208;hybridization, but rns/rnp&lt;1 for n&gt;2. More information can be found in the Full Paper by P. Pyykk&#246;, W.&#8197;H.&#8197;E. Schwarz, J. Li, et&#8197;al. on page 15558.

         <title>Cover Feature: An Organometallic Gold(I) Bis&#8208;N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Complex with Multimodal Activity in Ovarian Cancer Cells (Chem. Eur. J. 67/2020)</title>

A cationic AuI N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complex featuring caffeine&#8208;based ligands has shown potent and selective anticancer effects in ovarian cancer cells. This organogold compound is remarkably stable in physiological conditions. Therefore, the observed therapeutic effects are mainly due to non&#8208;covalent interactions of the gold compound with its pharmacological targets. Among the latter, DNA secondary structures&#8212;G&#8208;quadruplexes&#8212;play a pivotal role in the mechanisms of anticancer action. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S.&#8197;M. Meier&#8208;Menches, A. Casini, C. Gerner, et&#8197;al. on page 15528.

         <title>Frontispiece: Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Cycloaddition Reactions to Access Seven&#8208;Membered Rings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 26, Issue 67, December 1, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient and selective synthesis of functionalized seven&#8208;membered rings remains an important pursuit within synthetic organic chemistry. Use of cycloaddition reactions remains an attractive approach for their construction within the perspective of atom and step economy. This Review summarizes recent advances in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed construction of seven&#8208;membered rings via combination of 2&#8211;4 components mediated by a variety of metals. An emphasis is placed on the mechanistic aspects of these transformations to both illustrate the state of the science and to highlight the unique application of novel processes of transition&#8208;metals in these transformations. For more details see the Review by B.&#8197;M. Trost et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;15354&#8197;ff.

         <title>Frontispiece: Remote Fluorination and Fluoroalkyl(thiol)ation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 26, Issue 67, December 1, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Remote functionalization reactions have the power to transform a C&#8722;H (or C&#8722;C) bond at a distant position from a functional group. In the past few years, this strategy started to be practiced for the construction of versatile organofluorine compounds, such as remote fluorination, trifluoromethylation, difluoromethylation, trifluoromethylthiolation, and fluoroalkenation reactions. In this context, this Review aims to highlight key representative advances and breakthroughs in remote fluorination and fluoroalkyl(thiol)ation reactions with a particular emphasis on the control of reactivity and selectivity. For more details see the Review by I. Marek, F.&#8208;G. Zhang, et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;15378&#8197;ff.

Bone tissue disorders pose a life&#8208;limiting and, sometimes, life&#8208;threatening condition to millions of people worldwide. Even though there are already several treatments to manage bone disorders, only a few are fully curative. In this way, several efforts have been made to explore and develop novel and, hopefully, more efficient treatments. Within the recent advances in this area, the preparation of coordination compounds that are specifically designed to target and treat bone tissue disorders, thus being a very promising tool to tackle this worldwide are reviewed by J.&#8197;S. Barbosa, J. Rocha, F.&#8197;A. Almeida&#8197;Paz et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;15416&#8197;ff.

Vital! The recently delineated structure&#8208; and reactivity&#8208;based concept of antivitamins B12 has begun to bear fruit by the generation, and study, of a range of such B12&#8208;dummies, either vitamin B12&#8208;derived, or transition metal analogues that also represent potential antivitamins B12 or specific B12&#8208;antimetabolites. For more insight on new research avenues thus opened up, see the Minireview by B. Kr&#228;utler on page&#8197;15438&#8197;ff.

         <title>Frontispiece: Pnictogen&#8208;Bonding Catalysis: An Interactive Tool to Uncover Unorthodox Mechanisms in Polyether Cascade Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 26, Issue 67, December 1, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epoxide&#8208;opening polyether cascade cyclizations fascinate since the Nakanishi hypothesis was put forward to explain the biosynthesis of brevetoxin&#8197;B. By now, violations of the Baldwin rules are as common as speeding on the highway, McDonald elegantly mastered the inversion of directionality, but how can trans epoxides cyclize into cis&#8208;fused rings? A simple shift from SN2&#8208;type to SN1&#8208;type oxonium opening could be the answer. The currently emerging pnictogen&#8208;bonding catalysis reveals a completely different and quite spectacular alternative. For more details see the Communication by S. Matile et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;15471&#8197;ff.

The inherent competition between the bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2) and base&#8208;induced elimination (E2) reactions is depicted in the cover image. This work reports a physically sound and intuitive model to elucidate why strong Lewis bases act as protophiles (E2), while weak Lewis bases behave as nucleophiles (SN2). The general concepts of &#8220;characteristic distortivity&#8221; and &#8220;transition state acidity&#8221; are developed, which will serve as the cornerstone for the rational design of novel reactions. More information can be found in the Full Paper by T.&#8197;A. Hamlin, F.&#8197;M. Bickelhaupt, et&#8197;al. on page 15538.

         <title>Chemical&#8208;Synthesis&#8208;Based Approach to Glycoprotein Functions in the Endoplasmic Reticulum</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 26, Issue 67, Page 15461-15470, December 1, 2020. </description>

High&#8208;mannose&#8208;type glycans are introduced to specific asparagine residues of nascent polypeptides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of eukaryotic cells. They serve as key signals in the glycoprotein quality control (GPQC) system. To conduct precise analysis of GPQC, properly functionalized glycans and homogeneously glycosylated proteins were chemically synthesized and employed as substrates of components of GPQC. This Minireview highlights the strength of approaches based on chemical synthesis to understand biological events.







Abstract
The introduction of Asn&#8208;linked glycans to nascent polypeptides occurs in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotic cells. After the removal of specific sugar residues, glycoproteins acquire signals in the glycoprotein quality control (GPQC) system and enter the folding cycle composed of lectin&#8208;chaperones calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin (CRT), glucosidase&#8197;II (G&#8208;II), and UDP&#8208;Glc:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGGT). G&#8208;II initiates glycoproteins&#8217; entry and exit from the cycle, and UGGT serves as the &#8220;folding sensor&#8221;. This account summarizes our effort to analyze the properties of enzymes and lectins that play important roles in GPQC, especially those involved in the CNX/CRT cycle. To commence our study, general methods for the synthesis of high&#8208;mannose&#8208;type glycans and glycoproteins were established. Based on these, various substrates to analyze components of the GPQC were created, and properties of CRT, G&#8208;II, and UGGT have been clarified.

         <title>Antivitamins B12&#8212;Some Inaugural Milestones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 26, Issue 67, Page 15438-15445, December 1, 2020. </description>

Like a wolf in a sheep's clothing antivitamins B12 resemble vitamin B12 at the outside, but differ by the chemical character of their inside. As reviewed here, such B12&#8208;mimics with a specifically designed metal&#8208;centre are now available, having the potential of inducing devastating B12&#8208;deficiency in B12&#8208;dependent organisms, from mammals to microorganisms. Their application may provide biological and biomedical insights that induce the discovery of relevant applications in pharmacology and medicine.







Abstract
The recently delineated structure&#8208; and reactivity&#8208;based concept of antivitamins B12 has begun to bear fruit by the generation, and study, of a range of such B12&#8208;dummies, either vitamin B12&#8208;derived, or transition metal analogues that also represent potential antivitamins B12 or specific B12&#8208;antimetabolites. As reviewed here, this has opened up new research avenues in organometallic B12&#8208;chemistry and bioinorganic coordination chemistry. Exploratory studies with antivitamins B12 have, furthermore, revealed some of their potential, as pharmacologically interesting compounds, for inducing B12&#8208;deficiency in a range of organisms, from hospital resistant bacteria to laboratory mice. The derived capacity of antivitamins B12 to induce functional B12&#8208;deficiency in mammalian cells and organs also suggest their valuable potential as growth inhibitors of cancerous human and animal cells.

Recent advancements on doped carbon nanomaterials (e.g., graphene, carbon nanotubes and carbon nanohorns) as electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) are critically discussed, while current challenges and future perspectives are thoroughly addressed.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic processes, such as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), play key roles in various sustainable energy storage and production devices and their optimization in an ecological manner is of paramount importance for mankind. In this inclusive Review, we aspire to set the scene on doped carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials and their hybrids as precious&#8208;metal alternative electrocatalysts for these critical reactions in order for the research community not only to stay up&#8208;to&#8208;date, but also to get inspired and keep pushing forward towards their practical application in energy conversion.

Close to the bone: Metal&#8211;organic frameworks, coordination polymers and discrete coordination complexes can be used in the treatment of bone disorders. This Review provides an insight into recent progress in this area.







Abstract
Osteoporosis, Paget's disease and osteosarcoma are a few examples of bone tissue disorders that affect millions of people worldwide. These conditions can strictly limit the lifestyle of patients and may even lead to their demise. To prevent this or, at least, try to manage the situation, there are several treatments available on the market. Notwithstanding, research has been driven by the possibility to improve the existing therapies, as well as to find new approaches that could better respond to these diseases. In this Review the path is shown through which, in recent years, coordination compounds have been prepared and manufactured to be applied in the management of bone tissue disorders. Starting with the design and preparation of the coordination compounds with various dimensionalities, two approaches have been used: (1)&#8197;they are prepared as three&#8208;dimensional cages that can act as delivery systems for therapeutic substances, or (2)&#8197;they are constructed/prepared from compounds with intrinsic therapeutic properties. Following this, several strategies have been explored to manufacture the effective delivery to the patients. The versatility of coordination compounds has allowed their use in the preparation of drug tablets, coatings for titanium implants, or even scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. In the end, it becomes clear that these compounds can be a valuable approach to reach a better treatment for bone tissue disorders. Nonetheless, along the road, a few bumps have appeared concerning the therapeutic profile, such as the effect of the structural arrangement or particle size.

The major mechanisms of CB[n]s based supramolecular catalysis are summarized. CB[n]s can serve as nanoreactors and steric hindrance to modulate the reactivity of substrates. They can also catalyze the reactions by modulating the reactivity of ionized intermediates. Recent progresses on the CB[n]s&#8208;based supramolecular catalysis are also introduced. It is anticipated that this review helps scientists find new opportunities in this field.







Abstract
The control over chemical reactivity and selectivity are always pursued. Using non&#8208;covalent interactions to achieve efficient and selective catalysis is an essential goal of supramolecular catalysis. Supramolecular catalysis based on cucurbit[n]urils (CB[n]s) possesses distinct characteristics for the unique structure of CB[n]s. CB[n]s are a family of pumpkin&#8208;shaped host molecules with various molecular sizes, rigid structures, electronegative portals and wealthy host&#8208;guest chemistry. Herein, we summarize the three major mechanisms of CB[n]s based supramolecular catalysis. Owing to the structural properties of CB[n]s, CB[n]s can serve as nanoreactors and steric hindrance to modulate the reactivity of substrates. They can also catalyze the reactions by modulating the reactivity of ionized intermediates. Recent progresses on the CB[n]s based supramolecular catalysis are introduced in this Minireview and the future development in this field is discussed. It is anticipated that this review provides insights into the mechanism of CB[n]s based supramolecular catalysis and may help scientists find new opportunities in this field.

Heading to a remote reaction pattern for fluorine: Remote fluorination and fluoroalkyl(thiol)ation reactions transform C&#8722;H and C&#8722;C bonds far from a functional group has received increasing attention in the past decade. This Review summarizes recent advances and key breakthroughs in remote fluorination, trifluoromethylation, difluoromethylation, trifluoromethylthiolation, and fluoroalkenylation reactions of alkyl/aromatic C&#8722;H and C&#8722;C bonds.







Abstract
Remote functionalization reactions have the power to transform a C&#8722;H (or C&#8722;C) bond at a distant position from a functional group. This Review summarizes recent advances and key breakthroughs in remote fluorination, trifluoromethylation, difluoromethylation, trifluoromethylthiolation, and fluoroalkenylation reactions. Several powerful strategies have emerged to control the reactivity and distal selectivity such as the undirected radical approach, the 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer, the metal migration, the use of distant directing groups, and the ring&#8208;opening reactions. These unconventional and predictable C&#8722;H (and C&#8722;C) functionalization transformations should allow for the preparation of a wide range of otherwise&#8208;difficult&#8208;to&#8208;access alkyl, aromatic, heteroaromatic, and structurally complex fluorides.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Cycloaddition Reactions to Access Seven&#8208;Membered Rings</title>

         <dc:description>
The seven&#8208;membered ring systems constitute a vital structural motif in a great number of biologically active natural products. The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition reaction has unimpeachably emerged as a powerful and straightforward tool to render shorter synthetic routes for complex molecules. This Review summarizes recent progresses in this field.







Abstract
The efficient and selective synthesis of functionalized seven&#8208;membered rings remains an important pursuit within synthetic organic chemistry, as this motif appears in numerous drug&#8208;like molecules and natural products. Use of cycloaddition reactions remains an attractive approach for their construction within the perspective of atom and step economy. Additionally, the ability to combine multiple components in a single reaction has the potential to allow for efficient combinatorial strategies of diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis. The inherent entropic penalty associated with achieving these transformations has impressively been overcome with development of catalysis, whereby the reaction components can be pre&#8208;organized through activation by transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalysis. The fine&#8208;tuning of metal/ligand combinations as well as reaction conditions allows for achieving chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity in these transformations. Herein, we discuss recent advances in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed construction of seven&#8208;membered rings via combination of 2&#8211;4 components mediated by a variety of metals. An emphasis is placed on the mechanistic aspects of these transformations to both illustrate the state of the science and to highlight the unique application of novel processes of transition&#8208;metals in these transformations.

         <title>A Reversible Liquid&#8208;to&#8208;Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carrier System Based on Ethylene Glycol and Ethanol</title>

Hydrogen carriers: A liquid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid organic hydrogen carrier system based on reversible dehydrogenation and hydrogenation reactions by using ethylene glycol and ethanol is reported. Both the reactants are abundant, cheap, and non&#8208;toxic industrial raw materials. Moreover, this dehydrogenative esterification, as well as hydrogenation, can be conducted under base&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free conditions, thus offering a promising approach for application in hydrogen storage.







Abstract
Liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) are powerful systems for the efficient unloading and loading molecular hydrogen. Herein, a liquid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid organic hydrogen carrier system based on reversible dehydrogenative coupling of ethylene glycol (EG) with ethanol catalysed by ruthenium pincer complexes is reported. Noticeable advantages of the current LOHC system is that both reactants (hydrogen&#8208;rich components) and the produced esters (hydrogen&#8208;lean components) are liquids at room temperature, and the dehydrogenation process can be performed under solvent and base&#8208;free conditions. Moreover, the hydrogenation reaction proceeds under low hydrogen pressure (5&#8197;bar), and the LOHC system has a relatively high theoretical gravimetric hydrogen storage capacity (HSC&gt;5.0&#8197;wt&#8201;%), presenting an attractive hydrogen storage system.

         <title>Chemoselective Alpha&#8208;Deuteration of Amides via Retro&#8208;ene Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 26, Issue 67, Page 15509-15512, December 1, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Label me softly: A facile method for the &#945;&#8208;deuteration of amides via a retro&#8208;ene reaction was developed. The process is triggered by the addition of [D6]DMSO to activated amides and tolerates a broad&#8208;range of functional groups, affording products in good yields and with high levels of deuterium incorporation throughout.







Abstract
A synthetically convenient approach for the direct &#945;&#8208;deuteration of amides is reported. This mechanistically unusual process relies on a retro&#8208;ene&#8208;type process, triggered by the addition of deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide to a keteniminium intermediate, generated through electrophilic amide activation. The transformation displays broad functional&#8208;group tolerance and high deuterium incorporation.

         <title>Pnictogen&#8208;Bonding Catalysis: An Interactive Tool to Uncover Unorthodox Mechanisms in Polyether Cascade Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 26, Issue 67, Page 15471-15476, December 1, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
One of the hidden enigmas of natural&#8208;product inspired epoxide&#8208;opening polyether cascade cyclizations is the inversion of configuration from trans epoxides to cis&#8208;fused endo products. Here, pnictogen&#8208;bonding catalysis is introduced as an interactive tool to find the answer with an unorthodox mechanism centered around an acyclic, achiral hydroxy&#8208;5&#8208;enal intermediate, produced by C&#8722;C bond cleavage, then cyclized by stereoselective C&#8722;C bond formation.







Abstract
Pnictogen&#8208;bonding catalysis and supramolecular &#963;&#8208;hole catalysis in general is currently being introduced as the non&#8208;covalent counterpart of covalent Lewis acid catalysis. With access to anti&#8208;Baldwin cyclizations identified as unique characteristic, pnictogen&#8208;bonding catalysis appeared promising to elucidate one of the hidden enigmas of brevetoxin&#8208;type epoxide opening polyether cascade cyclizations, that is the cyclization of certain trans epoxides into cis&#8208;fused rings. In principle, a shift from SN2&#8208; to SN1&#8208;type mechanisms could suffice to rationalize this inversion of configuration. However, the same inversion could be explained by a completely different mechanism: Ring opening with C&#8722;C bond cleavage into a branched hydroxy&#8208;5&#8208;enal and the corresponding cyclic hemiacetal, followed by cascade cyclization under conformational control, including stereoselective C&#8722;C bond formation. In this report, a pnictogen&#8208;bonding supramolecular SbV catalyst is used to demonstrate that this unorthodox polyether cascade cyclization mechanism occurs.

         <title>Direct Catalytic Asymmetric Addition of &#945;&#8208;Fluoronitriles to Aldehydes</title>

The direct coupling of racemic &#945;&#8208;fluoronitriles and aldehydes promoted by a chiral CuI/Barton's base catalytic system, delivering &#945;&#8208;tetrasubstituted &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxynitriles with satisfactory stereoselection is described. Both aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes were implemented to provide densely and stereoselectively functionalized chiral building blocks with aliphatic and aromatic tails (see scheme).







Abstract
A fluorine&#8208;containing tetrasubstituted stereogenic center is a highly valued structural feature in medicinal chemistry. Herein, we describe the direct coupling of racemic &#945;&#8208;fluoronitriles and aldehydes promoted by a chiral CuI/Barton's base catalytic system, delivering &#945;&#8208;tetrasubstituted &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxynitriles with satisfactory stereoselection. The stereochemical course was positively biased by the combined use of asymmetrical achiral thiourea as a supplementary ligand for CuI, which significantly enhanced the stereoselectivity. Both aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes were implemented to provide densely and stereoselectively functionalized chiral building blocks with aliphatic and aromatic tails.

         <title>Controlling the Number of Branches and Surface Facets of Pd&#8208;Core Ru&#8208;Branched Nanoparticles to Make Highly Active Oxygen Evolution Reaction Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 26, Issue 67, Page 15501-15504, December 1, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Branched ruthenium nanoparticles with control of branch size and number of branches are presented using a new approach. These controls enable improved catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (see figure).







Abstract
Producing stable but active materials is one of the enduring challenges in electrocatalysis and other types of catalysis. Producing branched nanoparticles is one potential solution. Controlling the number of branches and branch size of faceted branched nanoparticles is one of the major synthetic challenges to achieve highly active and stable nanocatalysts. Herein, we use a cubic&#8208;core hexagonal&#8208;branch mechanism to synthesize branched Ru nanoparticles with control over the size and number of branches. This structural control is the key to achieving high exposure of active {10&#8211;11} facets and optimum number of Ru branches that enables improved catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction while maintaining high stability.

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective 1,3&#8208;Dipolar [6+4] Cycloadditions of Tropone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 26, Issue 67, Page 15491-15496, December 1, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
High on Tropone! A 1,3&#8208;dipolar [6+4] cycloaddition of tropone and azomethine ylides is disclosed. The multicomponent reaction, leading to complex bridged architectures from simple starting materials, is catalyzed by a chiral phosphoric acid and displays high yields and stereoselectivities. Multiple stereoselective transformations show the synthetic utility of the obtained cycloadducts.







Abstract
A highly stereoselective 1,3&#8208;dipolar [6+4] cycloaddition towards bridged azabicyclo[4.3.1]decane scaffolds has been developed, reacting aldehydes, 2&#8208;aminomalonates and tropone under mild conditions in the presence of a chiral phosphoric acid catalyst. The scope is demonstrated for a series of aldehydes and 2&#8208;aminomalonates, and the reaction proceeds in high yields, &gt;95:5&#8197;d.r. and up to 99&#8201;%&#8201;ee. A series of transformations, as well as a mechanistic proposal, are presented.

         <title>The Synthesis of Warfarin Using a Reconfigurable&#8208;Reactor Platform Integrated to a Multiple&#8208;Variable Optimization Tool</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 26, Issue 67, Page 15505-15508, December 1, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doing much more chemistry, much faster: An integrated, reconfigurable&#8208;reactor, multi&#8208;dimensional chromatography platform for multiple&#8208;reaction&#8208;attribute optimization has been invented. Without ever leaving the sampling/analysis component, a single reaction sample can be evaluated for two or more attributes in unique chromatographic dimensions and each result validated by re&#8208;purposing the peak of interest back through the same (or another) column.







Abstract
Optimization of the asymmetric synthesis of warfarin, an important anticoagulant, has been evaluated using a reconfigurable reaction platform capable of performing batch, continuous flow, and plug&#8208;flow synthesis. Further, this platform has been integrated with a novel, multidimensional, multiple variable analysis tool that can evaluate multiple critical quality attributes (CQA), percent conversion and enantiomeric excess in this case, from a single injection that is repeatedly recycled in a closed loop of chromatography columns, a detector and a heart&#8208;cut valve. Further, the new, integrated analysis system also facilitates validation of each QA, providing a high&#8208;level of confidence in analytical measurements, which are obtained without operator intervention.

         <title>Efficient Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Aerobic Oxidative Carbocyclization to Seven&#8208;Membered Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 26, Issue 67, Page 15513-15518, December 1, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterocycles: We report a PdII&#8208;catalyzed oxidative carbocyclization of the rationally designed bisallenes using molecular oxygen. By applying a bifunctional catalyst (Co(salophen)&#8208;HQ) as an efficient electron&#8208;transfer mediator, bisallenes are effectively converted to the corresponding seven&#8208;membered carbocycles in good yields (see scheme).







Abstract
The use of molecular oxygen in palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidation reactions is highly widespread in organic chemistry. However, the direct reoxidation of palladium by O2 is often kinetically unfavored, thus leading the deactivation of the palladium catalyst during the catalytic cycle. In the present work, we report a highly selective palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbocyclization of bisallenes to seven&#8208;membered heterocycles under atmospheric pressure of O2. The use of a homogenous hybrid catalyst (Co(salophen)&#8208;HQ, HQ=hydroquinone) significantly promotes efficient electron transfer between the palladium catalyst and O2 through a low&#8208;energy pathway. This aerobic oxidative transformation shows broad substrate scope and functional group compatibility and allowed the preparation of O&#8208;containing seven&#8208;membered rings in good yields in most cases.

         <title>Productive Syntheses of Privileged Scaffolds Inspired by the Recognition of a Diels&#8211;Alder Pattern Common to Three Classes of Natural Products</title>

Natural products&#8208;inspired chemistry: Identification of a common Diels&#8211;Alder pattern in three classes of bioactive natural products led to the discovery of very productive syntheses of stereochemically rich and functionally dense scaffolds for the construction of libraries of molecules of therapeutic interest.







Abstract
Identification of a common Diels&#8211;Alder pattern in three classes of bioactive natural products led us to study the synthesis and cycloaddition of a new class of cyclic dienes readily available from &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated lactams. A practical and readily scalable route to the parent p&#8208;methoxybenzyl&#8208;protected 6&#8208; and 7&#8208;membered &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated lactams was developed. These were readily transformed into the corresponding O&#8208;silylated dienes, which were reacted with dimethyl and diethyl fumarate to yield stereoselectively highly functionalized bicyclic adducts. These exhibited unexpected and versatile transformations upon acid hydrolysis depending on the nature of the dienophile substituents and the acid catalyst. All reactions have been performed on multigram quantities. These transformations provide a convenient, economical, and easily scalable pathway for the rapid construction of functionally and stereochemically dense privileged scaffolds for the construction of libraries of natural products&#8208;inspired molecules of pharmacological relevance.

         <title>Structural Snapshots of &#960;&#8208;Arene Bonding in a Gold Germylene Cation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 26, Issue 67, Page 15519-15523, December 1, 2020. </description>

Gold for the soul: These studies provide, for the first time, dynamic information about the conformational rearrangement that characterizes &#960;&#8208;arene bonding thorough a series of X&#8208;ray diffraction structural snapshots of gold metalogermylenium cation complexes with varying counter anions.







Abstract
Heavier group&#8197;14 element cations exhibit a remarkable reactivity that has typically hampered their isolation. For the few available examples, the role of &#960;&#8208;arene interactions is crucial to provide kinetic stabilization, but dynamic and structural information on those contacts is yet limited. In this study we have accessed the metalogermylenium cation [(PMe2ArDipp2)AuGe(ArDipp2)Cl]+ (4+) (ArDipp2=C6H3&#8208;2,6&#8208;(C6H3&#8208;2,6&#8208;iPr2)2) that has been structurally characterized with three different non&#8208;coordinating counter anions. These studies provide for the first time dynamic information about the conformational rearrangement that characterizes &#960;&#8208;arene bonding thorough a series of X&#8208;ray diffraction structural snapshots. Computational studies reveal the weak character of the &#960;&#8208;arene bonding (ca. 2&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) that can be described as the donation from a &#960;C=C bond toward the empty p valence orbital of germanium.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Directed Thiocyanation Reaction by C&#8722;H Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 26, Issue 67, Page 15497-15500, December 1, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
An original methodology was developed for the selective mono&#8208;thiocyanation of 2&#8208;phenylpyridine and heteroarene derivatives. With this additive&#8208; and ligand&#8208;free approach, an unprecedented and direct introduction of a SCN group was possible on a range of derivatives by a Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond functionalization (21 examples, up to 78&#8201;% yield). The importance of thiocyanated molecules was further demonstrated with post&#8208;functionalization reactions.







Abstract
The Pd&#8208;catalyzed directed thiocyanation reaction of arenes and heteroarenes by C&#8722;H bond activation was achieved. In the presence of an electrophilic SCN source, this original methodology offered an efficient tool to access a panel of functionalized thiocyanated compounds (21 examples, up to 78&#8201;% yield). Post&#8208;functionalization reactions further demonstrated the synthetic utility of the approach by converting the SCN&#8208;containing molecules into value&#8208;added scaffolds.

One for all: A single SpinPHOX/Ir (SpinPHOX=spiro[4,4]&#8208;1,6&#8208;nonadiene&#8208;based phosphine&#8208;oxazoline) catalyst was versatile in asymmetric hydrogenation of several types of aromatic benzoheterocycles or nonaromatic unsaturated heterocycles, including N&#8208;protected indoles, benzofurans, 2H&#8208;chromenes, and benzo[b]thiophene 1,1&#8208;dioxides, providing an efficient access to various chiral heterocyclic compounds in high yields and excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Enantioselective hydrogenation of a broad spectrum of N&#8208;, O&#8208;, and S&#8208;containing aromatic benzoheterocycles or nonaromatic unsaturated heterocycles has been realized by using an Ir/SpinPHOX (SpinPHOX=spiro[4,4]&#8208;1,6&#8208;nonadiene&#8208;based phosphine&#8208;oxazoline) complex as the catalyst, affording an array of the corresponding chiral benzoheterocycles (30&#8197;examples) with excellent enantioselectivities (&gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee in most cases) and turnover numbers up to 500.

         <title>Beyond p&#8208;Hexaphenylenes: Synthesis of Unsubstituted p&#8208;Nonaphenylene by a Precursor Protocol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unsubstituted para&#8208;nonaphenylenes were prepared via thermal aromatization of cyclohexadienylene precursors in thin films. The greenish fluorescence of the material is caused by pronounced aggregation in the solid state, in which electronic couplings leads to formation of H&#8208;type aggregates. The emission bands of this small&#8208;molecule are similar with respect to its polymer analogue.







Abstract
The synthesis of unsubstituted oligo&#8208;para&#8208;phenylenes (OPP) exceeding para&#8208;hexaphenylene&#8212;in the literature often referred to as p&#8208;sexiphenyl&#8212;has long remained elusive due to their insolubility. We report the first preparation of unsubstituted para&#8208;nonaphenylenes (9PPs) by extending our precursor route to poly&#8208;para&#8208;phenylenes (PPP) to a discrete oligomer. Two geometric isomers of methoxylated syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;cyclohexadienylenes were synthesized, from which 9PP was obtained via thermal aromatization in thin films. 9PP was characterized via optical, infrared and solid&#8208;state 13C&#8197;NMR spectroscopy as well as atomic force microscopy and mass spectrometry, and compared to polymeric analogues. Due to the lack of substitution, para&#8208;nonaphenylene, irrespective of the precursor isomer employed, displays pronounced aggregation in the solid state. Intermolecular excitonic coupling leads to formation of H&#8208;type aggregates, red&#8208;shifting emission of the films to greenish. 9PP allows to study the structure&#8211;property relationship of para&#8208;phenylene oligomers and polymers, especially since the optical properties of PPP depend on the molecular shape of the precursor.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Cubic and Dice&#8208;Like Microstructures of Higher Fullerene C78 with Enhanced Photoelectrochemical and Photoluminescence Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of three&#8208;dimensional micro&#8208;cubes and micro&#8208;dice of C78 via a facile liquid&#8211;liquid interfacial precipitation method is systematically studied. The cubic microstructures are readily transformed into dice&#8208;like microstructures by simply shaking the solution. More importantly, both microstructures exhibit photoelectrochemical and photoluminescence properties, indicating potential applications of such higher fullerenes in optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
The single&#8208;crystal micro/nanostructures of fullerene species, namely C60 and C70, have been previously studied, but studies on the morphology and properties of higher fullerenes have rarely been reported due to the limited amount of samples and their ellipsoidal isomeric structures. Herein, we report the formation of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) micro&#8208;cubes and micro&#8208;dice of a higher fullerene (C78) via a facile liquid&#8211;liquid interfacial precipitation (LLIP) method. The micro&#8208;cubes were prepared by regulating the concentration of C78 in trimethylbenzene (TMB) and the volume ratio of TMB and isopropanol. Interestingly, the micro&#8208;cubes are transformed into micro&#8208;dice with an open&#8208;hole on each crystal face by simply shaking the solution. X&#8208;ray diffraction and Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopic studies revealed a simple cubic unit cell with a lattice constant of 10.6&#8197;&#197; and intercalated TMB molecules in both crystals. The C78 cubic and dice&#8208;like microstructures exhibited enhanced photoelectrochemical and photoluminescence properties compared with pristine C78 powder, indicating their potential applications as photodetectors and photoelectric devices.

</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;We show here that micellar aggregation of amphiphilic Gd3+ complexes drastically influences their binding affinity to &#946;&#8208;amyloid or amylin, implicated in Alzheimer's disease and in diabetes, respectively. The monomeric form is the strongest binder and can attain as high as nanomolar affinities.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;&#9642;&#9642;&#8197;ff.

         <title>Push&#8211;Pull Bisnaphthyridylamine Supramolecular Nanoparticles: Polarity&#8208;Induced Aggregation and Crystallization&#8208;Induced Emission Enhancement and Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emissive bisnaphthyridylamine derivatives (BNA&#8208;X) have been prepared. In MeOH/water mixtures, the BNA&#8208;X containing alkyl groups or a phenyl ring showed aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) and crystallization&#8208;induced emission enhancement (CIEE) depending on the water content. The AIEE behavior was based on the formation of nanoparticles (NPs) with small polydispersity indices. In the presence of pyrene, the NPs showed fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET).







Abstract
Emissive push&#8211;pull&#8208;type bisnaphthyridylamine derivatives (BNA&#8208;X: X=Me, Et, Bzl, Ph, BuBr, and BuTEMPO) aggregate in aqueous methanol. Furthermore, a two&#8208;step emission and aggregation process is controllable by varying the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;water ratio. At 2:3 MeOH/H2O, crystallization&#8208;induced emission enhancement (CIEE) occurs via formation of an emissive crystal phase, whereas, at 1:9 MeOH/H2O, aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) occurs, induced by emissive supramolecular nanoparticles (NPs). For BNA&#8208;Ph, the emission quantum yield was 25 times higher in aqueous methanol than that in pure methanol. Despite the high hydrophobicity of BNA&#8208;X (C&#8201;log&#8201;P=6.1&#8211;8.0), the spherical NPs were monodisperse (polydispersity indices &lt;0.2). Moreover, the emissive NPs exhibited fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) with pyrene; however, for BNA&#8208;X bearing the TEMPO radical (BNA&#8208;BuTEMPO), no FRET was observed because of quenching. In particular, the BNA&#8208;BuTEMPO NPs have a slow rotational correlation time (1.3&#8197;ns), suggesting applications as magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents with large relaxivity.

         <title>Main Group Metal&#8208;Mediated Transformations of Imines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imines are prevalent in synthetic laboratories due to their versatile reactivity profiles, providing access to various N&#8208;containing molecules. Herein, this review summarizes well established main group metal&#8208;mediated transformations and recent developments in current topics including C&#8211;F activation, catalysis, sustainable reaction media and flow chemistry.







Abstract
Main&#8208;group&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated transformations of imines have earned a valued place in the synthetic chemist's toolbox. Their versatility allows the simple preparation of various nitrogen containing compounds. This review will outline the early discoveries including metallation, addition/cyclisation and metathesis pathways, followed by the modern&#8208;day use of imines in synthetic methodology. Recent advances in imine C&#8722;F activation protocols are discussed, alongside revisiting &#8220;classic&#8221; imine reactivity from a sustainable perspective. Developments in catalytic methods for hydroelementation of imines have been reviewed, highlighting the importance of s&#8208;block metals in the catalytic arena. Whilst stoichiometric transformations in alternative reaction media such as deep eutectic solvents or water have been summarised. The incorporation of imines into flow chemistry has received recent attention and is summarised within.

2,2&#8217;&#8208;Bipyridine ligands (dsbpys) with dumbbell&#8208;like shapes and differently substituted triarylmethyl groups at the C5 and C5&#8217; positions showed high ligand performance in the Ni&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling and the Ni/photoredox&#8208;synergistically catalyzed decarboxylative coupling reactions (see figure). The superior ligand effects of dsbpys compared to the conventional bpy ligands were attributed to the monochelating nature of dsbpys.

         <title>Rational Design of a ZnII MOF with Multiple Functional Sites for Highly Efficient Fixation of CO2 under Mild Conditions: Combined Experimental and Theoretical Investigation</title>

Terminal catch: The rational design of a porous ZnII metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) incorporating multiple functional sites suitable for highly efficient fixation of CO2 with terminal/internal epoxides under mild conditions supported by comprehensive theoretical studies to provide insight on the mechanistic details of the catalytic process is presented.







Abstract
The development of efficient heterogeneous catalysts suitable for carbon capture and utilization (CCU) under mild conditions is a promising step towards mitigating the growing concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. Herein, we report the construction of a hydrogen&#8208;bonded 3D framework, {[Zn(hfipbba)(MA)]&#8901;3&#8201;DMF}n (hfipbba=4,4&#8242;&#8208;(hexaflouroisopropylene)bis(benzoic acid)) (HbMOF1) utilizing ZnII center, a partially fluorinated, long&#8208;chain dicarboxylate ligand (hfipbba), and an amine&#8208;rich melamine (MA) co&#8208;ligand. Interestingly, the framework possesses two types of 1D channels decorated with CO2&#8208;philic (&#8722;NH2 and &#8722;CF3) groups that promote the highly selective CO2 adsorption by the framework, which was supported by computational simulations. Further, the synergistic involvement of both Lewis acidic and basic sites exposed in the confined 1D channels along with high thermal and chemical stability rendered HbMOF1 a good heterogeneous catalyst for the highly efficient fixation of CO2 in a reaction with terminal/internal epoxides at mild conditions (RT and 1&#8197;bar CO2). Moreover, in&#8208;depth theoretical studies were carried out using periodic DFT to obtain the relative energies for each stage involved in the catalytic reaction and an insight mechanistic details of the reaction is presented. Overall, this work represents a rare demonstration of rational design of a porous ZnII MOF incorporating multiple functional sites suitable for highly efficient fixation of CO2 with terminal/internal epoxides at mild conditions supported by comprehensive theoretical studies.

         <title>From Distinct Metallopeptoids to Self&#8208;Assembled Supramolecular Architectures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design and synthesis of biomimetic architectures through the self&#8208;assembly of distinct copper&#8208;peptoid duplexes is reported. Alternating the non&#8208;coordinating side&#8208;chain at the C&#8208;terminus of trimer peptoids allows for the control of the metallopeptoid supramolecular architectures. Tightly packed helical rods or nano&#8208;channels can be obtained. All the metallopeptoids structures are stable in aqueous solution and the selective recognition abilities of the nano&#8208;channels towards glycerol is demonstrated.







Abstract
The construction of synthetic protein mimics is a central goal in chemistry. A known approach for achieving this goal is the self&#8208;assembly of synthetic biomimetic sequences into supramolecular structures. Obtaining different 3D structures via a simple sequence modification, however, is still challenging. Herein we present the design and synthesis of biomimetic architectures, via the self&#8208;assembly of distinct copper&#8208;peptoid duplexes. We demonstrate that changing only one non&#8208;coordinating side&#8208;chain within the peptoids&#8212;sequence&#8208;specific N&#8208;substituted glycine oligomers&#8212;leads to different supramolecular structures. Four peptoid trimers incorporating 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine and pyridine ligands, and a non&#8208;coordinating but rather a structure&#8208;directed bulky group were synthesized, and their solutions were treated with Cu2+ in a 1:1 ratio. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of the products revealed the self&#8208;assembly of each peptoid into a metallopeptoid duplex, followed by the self&#8208;assembly of multiple duplexes and their packing into a three&#8208;dimensional supramolecular architecture via hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. Tuning the non&#8208;coordinating side&#8208;chain enables to regulate both the final structure being either a tightly packed helical rod or a nano&#8208;channel, and the pore width of the nano&#8208;channels. Importantly, all the metallopeptoids structures are stable in aqueous solution as verified by cryo&#8208;TEM measurements and supported by UV/Vis and EPR spectroscopies and by ESI&#8208;MS analysis. Thus, we could also demonstrate the selective recognition abilities of the nano&#8208;channels towards glycerol.

         <title>Thermodynamically Stable o&#8208;Quinodimethane: Synthesis, Structure, and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isolable o&#8208;quiondimethanes are prepared by thermal ring&#8208;opening of cyclobutaphenanthrenes. In addition to benzo&#8208;annulation on parent benzocyclobutene, sterically congested aryloxy or siloxy groups on the four&#8208;membered ring promote the ring&#8208;opening, affording a thermodynamically stable &#960;&#8208;extended o&#8208;quinodimethane.







Abstract
Thermal isomerization of cyclobutaphenanthrene to o&#8208;quinodimethane was investigated. Sterically congested substituents or electron&#8208;donating substituents on the four&#8208;membered ring promoted the ring&#8208;opening, affording o&#8208;quinodimethane in a relatively stable form. Isolation of the newly prepared o&#8208;quinodimethane allowed its structural elucidation and investigation of its potential reactivities. Dual [4+2] cycloaddition of an aryne and o&#8208;quinodimethane afforded tetrabenzopentacene, demonstrating the synthetic application of the isolated compound.

An assembly of cages: Reactions of the benzimidazole derived tris(azolium) salts [H3&#8208;3&#8201;a,b](PF6)3 with Ag2O under self&#8208;assembly provide access to AgI&#8208;NHC&#8208;based unique hexanuclear organometallic cages of composition [Ag6(3&#8201;a,b)4](PF6)6, which undergo transmetalation reactions with CuI/AuI&#8208;ions to produce various coinage metal&#8208;NHC complexes of diverse compositions depending on the N&#8208;wingtip group of the ligands 3&#8201;a,b.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;ligand self&#8208;assembly to attain the AgI&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;built hexanuclear organometallic cages of composition [Ag6(3&#8201;a,b)4](PF6)6 from the reaction of benzimidazole&#8208;derived tris(azolium) salts [H3&#8208;3&#8201;a,b](PF6)3 with Ag2O was achieved. The molecular structures of the cages were established by X&#8208;ray diffraction studies along with NMR and MS analyses. The existence of a single assembly in solution was supported by diffusion&#8208;ordered spectroscopy (DOSY) 1H&#8197;NMR spectra. Further, transmetalation reactions of these self&#8208;assembled complexes, [Ag6(3&#8201;a,b)4](PF6)6, with CuI/AuI&#8208;ions provided various coinage metal&#8208;NHC complexes having diverse molecular compositions, which included the first example of a hexanuclear CuI&#8208;dodecacarbene complex, [Cu6(3&#8201;b)4](PF6)6.

This approach featured the employment of an organocatalytic asymmetric Michael addition reaction and a nitrogen&#8208;to&#8208;carbon chirality transfer to forge three chiral centers, as well as a catalytic hydrosilylation for the chemoselective reduction of a key lactam intermediate. The tricyclic intermediate contained all the required functionalities for elaborating into (+)&#8208;sarain A.

         <title>Excitation Energy Transfer and Exchange&#8208;Mediated Quartet State Formation in Porphyrin&#8208;Trityl Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photogenerated multi&#8208;spin systems composed of a porphyrin chromophore and a trityl radical are investigated with respect to their optical and magnetic properties. Profiting from the time&#8208;resolution of fs&#8208;TA spectroscopy and the capability of EPR to distinguish near&#8208;degenerate states with different spin multiplicity, this work reports unique insight into the excited&#8208;state reaction mechanism and suggests improvements to the molecular design in view of applications in the fields of molecular spintronics and artificial photosynthesis.







Abstract
Photogenerated multi&#8208;spin systems hold great promise for a range of technological applications in various fields, including molecular spintronics and artificial photosynthesis. However, the further development of these applications, via targeted design of materials with specific magnetic properties, currently still suffers from a lack of understanding of the factors influencing the underlying excited state dynamics and mechanisms on a molecular level. In particular, systematic studies, making use of different techniques to obtain complementary information, are largely missing. This work investigates the photophysics and magnetic properties of a series of three covalently&#8208;linked porphyrin&#8208;trityl compounds, bridged by a phenyl spacer. By combining the results from femtosecond transient absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies, we determine the efficiencies of the competing excited state reaction pathways and characterise the magnetic properties of the individual spin states, formed by the interaction between the chromophore triplet and the stable radical. The differences observed for the three investigated compounds are rationalised in the context of available theoretical models and the implications of the results of this study for the design of a molecular system with an improved intersystem crossing efficiency are discussed.

     alt="Excitation Energy Transfer and Exchange&#8208;Mediated Quartet State Formation in Porphyrin&#8208;Trityl Systems"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Photogenerated multi&#8208;spin systems&lt;/b&gt; composed of a porphyrin chromophore and a trityl radical are investigated with respect to their optical and magnetic properties. Profiting from the time&#8208;resolution of fs&#8208;TA spectroscopy and the capability of EPR to distinguish near&#8208;degenerate states with different spin multiplicity, this work reports unique insight into the excited&#8208;state reaction mechanism and suggests improvements to the molecular design in view of applications in the fields of molecular spintronics and artificial photosynthesis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photogenerated multi&#8208;spin systems hold great promise for a range of technological applications in various fields, including molecular spintronics and artificial photosynthesis. However, the further development of these applications, via targeted design of materials with specific magnetic properties, currently still suffers from a lack of understanding of the factors influencing the underlying excited state dynamics and mechanisms on a molecular level. In particular, systematic studies, making use of different techniques to obtain complementary information, are largely missing. This work investigates the photophysics and magnetic properties of a series of three covalently&#8208;linked porphyrin&#8208;trityl compounds, bridged by a phenyl spacer. By combining the results from femtosecond transient absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies, we determine the efficiencies of the competing excited state reaction pathways and characterise the magnetic properties of the individual spin states, formed by the interaction between the chromophore triplet and the stable radical. The differences observed for the three investigated compounds are rationalised in the context of available theoretical models and the implications of the results of this study for the design of a molecular system with an improved intersystem crossing efficiency are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Enhanced Electron Transfer and Ion Transport by Binary and Multidimensional CuCo2S4/Fe2O3 on Carbon Cloth for Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron OER: CuCo2S4 nanosheets and carbon cloth (CC) are connected with Fe2O3 nanoparticles to form CuCo2S4/Fe2O3/CC. Compared with CuCo2S4/CC, the resistances of electron transfer and ion transport are decreased by 65 and 84&#8201;%, respectively. The binary component and multidimensional structure promote the electron and ion transport and enhance the structure stability for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).







Abstract
The behavior of electron transfer and ion transport plays a significant role in the electrocatalytic activity. However, the improvement of CuCo2S4 electrocatalytic activity has been a difficult problem owing to lack of effective electron transfer and ion transport. Herein, the unique structure connected CuCo2S4 nanosheets and carbon cloth (CC) with Fe2O3 nanoparticles to form CuCo2S4/Fe2O3/CC. Compared with CuCo2S4/CC, the resistances of electron transfer and ion transport were decreased by 65 and 84&#8201;%, respectively. The electrochemical surface area of CuCo2S4/Fe2O3/CC was 2.76 times larger than that of CuCo2S4/CC due to the high double&#8208;layer capacitance. For the oxygen evolution reaction, CuCo2S4/Fe2O3/CC could achieve an overpotential of 273&#8197;mV and a Tafel slope of 67&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 in alkaline solution.

         <title>Quantifying the Overall Efficiency of Circularly Polarized Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new tool, named circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) brightness (BCPL), is introduced to evaluate the performances of CPL emitters. Beyond the dissymmetry factor, it takes into account quantum yields and extinction coefficients, allowing an easy and direct comparison of various CPL&#8208;emitters belonging to different chemical classes.







Abstract
An increasing number of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) molecular emitters has been developed in recent years and many of them are intended for applications in which high overall CPL efficiencies are required. In order to have a complete picture of the efficiency of a CPL emitter, dissymmetry factor (glum) is not enough. In the following we propose a new quantity, named CPL brightness (BCPL), which takes into account absorption extinction coefficient and quantum yield along with the glum factor. We calculated BCPL value for more than 180 compounds reported in the literature and we analyse data distribution for the main classes of CPL molecular emitters. This tool can be employed to put into context new CPL active compounds and to direct the choice of molecular systems for specific CPL applications.

Abstract
A formal reductive [3+2] annulation of 4,4,4&#8208;trifluorocrotonate and &#945;&#8208;iminoketones was developed under Br&#248;nsted base catalysis. A single phosphazene base efficiently catalyzes the one&#8208;pot tandem reaction involving two mechanistically different elementary processes, namely the chemoselective reduction of an imine moiety of &#945;&#8208;iminoketones with thiols as the reductant and the subsequent intermolecular Michael addition of an enolate of &#945;&#8208;aminoketones concomitant with lactam formation. This operationally simple method provides &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted &#947;&#8208;lactams with a tetrasubstituted carbon as a single diastereomer.

         <dc:description>The hexacoordinated antimony(V) dication [(ppy)3Sb]2+  ([1]2+; ppy = 2&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)phenyl), stabilized by three intramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor interactions, was isolated as its hexachloroantimonate salt [1][SbCl6]2, which was prepared by the oxidative addition of chlorine to the neutral stibine (ppy)3Sb (1) followed by the abstraction of chloride. Air&#8208;stable [1][SbCl6]2  also exhibits remarkable thermal stability and the three ppy ligands on the Sb atom are magnetically inequivalent in the  1H and  13C NMR spectra. A hexacoordinated, meridional octahedral bonding geometry was determined for [1][SbCl6]2  by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Theoretical calculations were used to investigate why the meridional form was generated preferentially over the facial form. In addition, the dynamics of the ppy ligands were investigated using variable&#8208;temperature  1H NMR spectroscopy. Other methods to generate dications using a single electron transfer (SET) reagent were also investigated. The structural determination of [1]2+  is the first for a [12&#8211;Sb&#8211;6]2+  chemical species.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Classical Abramov Products Formed on Orifices of Cage&#8208;Opened C60 Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By nucleophilic addition of phosphite P(OMe)  3  to a cage&#8208;opened C  60  derivative, &#945;&#8208;hydrophosphate and enol phosphate were obtained as kinetic and thermodynamic products, respectively. Different from classical Abramov products bearing a phosphorus&#8211;carbon bond, these products have a phosphorus&#8211;oxygen bond. The observed anomaly originates from the fully conjugated &#960;&#8208;system which significantly stabilizes zwitterionic intermediates bearing a phosphorus&#8211;oxygen bond. The thus formed enol phosphate was found to exhibit an intense absorption band that extended to 730 nm, reflecting the intramolecular charge transfer transitions. We also report domino phosphorylation reactions which gave a cage&#8208;opened C  60  derivative bearing a direct P&#8211;C bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Chalcogen Stabilized bis&#8208;Hydridoborate Complexes of Cobalt: Analogues of Tetracyclo[4.3.0.02,4.03,5]nonane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chalcogen stabilized bis&#8208;hydridoborate complexes of cobalt with unusual bonding have been synthesized. Complexes (A) and (B) are the structural mimic of species [(Cp*Co)2(&#956;&#8208;S)2(&#954;&#8208;S)2] and tetracyclo[4.3.0.02,4.03,5]nonane, respectively (see picture).







Abstract
Treatment of Li[BH3ER] (E=Se or Te, R=Ph; E=S, R=CH2Ph) with [Cp*CoCl]2 led to the formation of hydridoborate complexes, [{CoCp*Ph}{Cp*Co}{&#956;&#8208;EPh}{&#956;&#8208;&#954;2&#8208;E,H&#8208;EBH3}], 1a and 1&#8201;b (1&#8201;a: E=Se; 1&#8201;b: E=Te) and a bis&#8208;hydridoborate species [Cp*Co{&#956;&#8208;&#954;2&#8208;Se,H&#8208;SeBH3}]2, 2. All the complexes, 1&#8201;a, 1&#8201;b and 2 are stabilized by &#946;&#8208;agostic type interaction in which 1&#8201;b represents a novel bimetallic borate complex with a rare B&#8722;Te bond. QTAIM analysis furnished direct proof for the existence of a shared and dative B&#8208;chalcogen and Co&#8208;chalcogen interactions, respectively. In parallel to the formation of the hydridoborate complexes, the reactions also yielded tetracyclic species, [Cp*Co{&#954;3&#8208;E,H,H&#8208;E(BH2)2&#8208;C5Me5H3}], 3&#8201;a and 3&#8201;b (3&#8201;a: E=Se and 3&#8201;b: E=S), wherein the bridgehead boron atoms are surrounded by one chalcogen, one cobalt and two carbon atoms of a cyclopentane ring. Molecules 3&#8201;a and 3&#8201;b are best described as the structural mimic of tetracyclo[4.3.0.02,4.03,5]nonane having identical structure and similar valence electron counts.

         <title>Silver(I) Oxide&#8208;/DBU&#8208;Promoted Synthesis of Dihydrofuran Units through Allenyl Silver Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An easy way to complex: An unprecedented isomerization/allenyl silver formation/[3+2] cyclization promoted by a combination of silver salts and base is presented. The reaction, which is broad in scope, allows the straightforward and diastereoselective (up to 95:5 dr) synthesis of complex dihydrofuran frameworks under mild conditions from easily accessible substrates.







Abstract
A formal [3+2] cyclization mediated by silver(I) oxide and 1,8&#8208;diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;ene (DBU) is described herein. Through a broad variety of carbonyl compounds, this system can promote cyclization reactions with high yield (up to 85&#8201;%) and diastereoselectivity (up to 95:5) for a straightforward access to complex and congested dihydrofuran derivatives in one step under mild conditions. Based on DFT studies, the proposed mechanism would involve an allenyl silver intermediate.

         <title>Terpyridine based 3D Metal&#8208;Organic&#8208;Frameworks: A Structure&#8208;Property Correlation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Design, synthesis, and applications of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are among the most salient fields of research in modern inorganic and materials chemistry. As the structure and physical properties of MOFs are mostly dependent on the organic linkers or ligands, the choice of ligand system always gets importance in the design of MOFs. One such crucial organic linker/ligand is terpyridine (tpy), which can adopt various coordination modes to generate an enormous number of metal&#8208;organic frameworks. These frameworks generally carry physicochemical characteristics induced by the &#960;&#8722;electron&#8208;rich (basically N&#8208;electron rich moiety) terpyridines. In this minireview, we intend to discuss the construction of 3D MOFs associated with symmetrical terpyridines. These ligands could be easily derivatized at the lateral phenyl (4&#697;&#8208;phenyl) position and incorporate additional organic functionalities. These functionalities lead to some different binding modes and form higher dimensional (3D) frameworks. Therefore, these 3D MOFs can carry multiple features along with the characteristics of terpyridines. Some properties of these MOFs, like photophysical, chemical selectivity, photocatalytic degradation, proton conductivity, and magnetism, etc. have also been discussed and correlated with their frameworks.</dc:description>

         <title>Iminoboronates as dual purpose linkers in chemical probe development</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical probes that covalently modify proteins of interest are powerful tools for the research of biological processes. Important in the design of a probe is the choice of reactive group that forms the covalent bond, as it decides the success of a probe. However, choosing the right reactive group is not a simple feat and methodologies for expedient screening of different groups are needed. We here report a modular approach that allows easy coupling of a reactive group to a ligand. &#945;&#8208;Nucleophile ligands are combined with 2&#8208;formylphenylboronic acid&#8208;derived reactive groups to form iminoboronate probes that selectively label their target proteins. A transimination reaction on the labeled proteins with an &#945;&#8208;amino hydrazide provides further modification, for example to introduce a fluorophore.</dc:description>

         <title>A Simple Method for Synthesizing Highly Active Amorphous Iridium Oxide for Oxygen Evolution under Acidic Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Down to the wire: Amorphous Ir oxide was synthesized on the surface of an Ir metal anode by surface oxidation at high potential (60&#8197;V). This simple synthetic method prepared the most efficient and stable Ir&#8208;based oxygen&#8208;evolving electrocatalyst so far, which showed high activity and remained stable under electrochemical conditions. Moreover, IrOx that was mechanically separated from the surface of IrOx/Ir after operation showed a threefold increase in activity compared to the current benchmark IrO2 catalyst.







Abstract
Water splitting for hydrogen production has been recognized as a promising approach to store sustainable energy. The performance of this method is limited by the oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction. Herein, an approach for synthesizing a highly active oxygen&#8208;evolving catalyst by a one&#8208;step, low&#8208;cost, environmentally friendly, and easy&#8208;to&#8208;perform method is presented, which works by using iridium metal as the anode at a relatively high potential. The obtained IrOx/Ir interface showed an overpotential of 250&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 0.1&#8201;m HClO4 and remained stable under electrochemical conditions. The IrOx that was mechanically separated from the surface of IrOx/Ir metal after operation showed a threefold increase in activity compared to the current benchmark IrO2 catalyst. Various characterization analyses were used to identify the structure and morphology of the catalyst, which suggested nanosized, porous, and amorphous IrOx on the surface of metallic Ir. This synthetic approach can inspire a variety of opportunities to design and synthesize efficient metal oxide&#8208;based electrocatalysts for sustainable energy conversion and utilization.

   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; on the surface of metallic Ir. This synthetic approach can inspire a variety of opportunities to design and synthesize efficient metal oxide&#8208;based electrocatalysts for sustainable energy conversion and utilization.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Smart Shell&#8208;by&#8208;Shell Nanoparticles with Tunable Perylene Fluorescence in the Organic Interlayer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adjustable fluorescence features of a perylene unit in the organic interlayer of SbS&#8208;functionalized Al2O3 NPs were described. A perylene terminated phosphonic acid is attached covalently onto the NP surface, amphiphiles generated the second ligand shell. Depending on the type of amphiphile, changes in the initial fluorescence properties of the perylene were observed, that could be matched to aggregation, disaggregation, or electronic effects.







Abstract
A new series of shell&#8208;by&#8208;shell (SbS)&#8208;functionalized Al2O3 nanoparticles (NPs) containing a perylene core in the organic interlayer as a fluorescence marker is introduced. Initially, the NPs were functionalized with both, a fluorescent perylene phosphonic acid derivative, together with the lipophilic hexadecylphosphonic acid or the fluorophilic (1&#8201;H,1&#8201;H,2&#8201;H,2H&#8208;perfluorodecyl)phosphonic acid. The lipophilic first&#8208;shell functionalized NPs were further implemented with amphiphiles built of aliphatic chains and polar head&#8208;groups. However, the fluorophilic NPs were combined with amphiphiles consisting of fluorocarbon tails and polar head&#8208;groups. Depending on the nature of the combined phosphonic acids and the amphiphiles, tuning of the perylene fluorescence can be accomplished due variations of supramolecular organization with the shell interface. Because the SbS&#8208;functionalized NPs dispose excellent dispersibility in water and in biological media, two sorts of NPs with different surface properties were tested with respect to biological fluorescent imaging applications. Depending on the agglomeration of the NPs, the cellular uptake differs. The uptake of larger agglomerates is facilitated by endocytosis, whereas individualized NPs cross directly the cellular membrane. Also, the larger agglomerates were preferentially incorporated by all tested cells.

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Hydrophobic Drug Release Based on Microwave&#8208;Responsive Graphene Hydrogel Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first 915&#8197;MHz microwave (MW) responsive soft scaffold is herein presented. The hydrated nature of the scaffold allows MW&#8208;induced water motion inside the network to increase mobility of model hydrophobic drug, eventually leading to improved drug delivery. The graphene embedded in the hydrogel matrix acts as a heat sink during MW exposure and prevents overheating of the scaffold, pointing these hydrogels as suitable candidates for on&#8208;demand remote drug delivery. The material can find applications in the biomedical field, such as bioimplants, tissue engineering or 3D cell culture.







Abstract
Electromagnetically driven drug delivery systems stand out among stimulus&#8208;responsive materials due to their ability to release cargo on demand by remote stimulation, such as light, near infrared (NIR) or microwave (MW) radiation. MW&#8208;responsive soft materials, such as hydrogels, generally operate at 2.45&#8197;GHz frequencies, which usually involves rapid overheating of the scaffold and may affect tissue surrounding the target location. In contrast, 915&#8197;MHz MW penetrate deeper tissues and are less prone to induce rapid overheating. In order to circumvent these limitations, we present here for the first time a graphene&#8208;based hydrogel that is responsive to MW irradiation of &#957;=915&#8197;MHz. This system is a candidate soft scaffold to deliver a model hydrophobic drug. The graphene present in the hydrogel acts as a heat&#8208;sink and avoids overheating of the scaffold upon MW irradiation. In addition, the microwave trigger stimulates the in vitro delivery of the model drug, thus suggesting a remote and deep&#8208;penetrating means to deliver a drug from a delivery reservoir. Moreover, the MW&#8208;triggered release of drug was observed to be enhanced under acidic conditions, where the swelling state is maximum due to the swelling&#8208;induced pH&#8208;responsiveness of the hydrogel. The hybrid composite described here is a harmless means to deliver remotely a hydrophobic drug on demand with a MW source of 915&#8197;MHz. Potential use in biomedical applications were evaluated by cytotoxicity tests.

Two&#8208;pronged approach: A facile method to tether two different bioactive molecules to the [PtCl2] fragment through modified bipyridine&#8208;type ligands is described. A combination of ethacrynic acid and flurbiprofen residues overcomes cisplatin&#8208;based resistance and provides strong cancer cell selectivity. Enzyme inhibition assays and cross&#8208;experiments with an analogous complex lacking bio&#8208;groups revealed a clear synergy between the PtII unit and the bioactive organic components.







Abstract
A facile route to PtII complexes doubly functionalized with bioactive molecules through a bipyridine&#8208;type ligand is described. Initially, ligands LEE (containing two ethacrynic acid units), LEF (ethacrynic acid+flurbiprofen) and LEB (ethacrynic acid+biotin) were obtained in moderate to good yields from 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylic acid. Subsequent reaction of the ligands with [PtCl2(DMSO)2] afforded complexes [PtCl2(LEE)] (2), [PtCl2(LEF)] (3) and [PtCl2(LEB)] (4) in high yields. All compounds were fully characterized by analytical and spectroscopic methods. Complexes&#8197;2&#8211;4 are highly stable in water/DMSO solution at 37&#8201;&#176;C after 72&#8197;h, whereas progressive release of the bioactive fragments was detected in a cell culture medium. The compounds were assessed for their in vitro antiproliferative activity towards tumorigenic A2780, A2780cisR and Y79 cells and non&#8208;tumourigenic HEK293 cells. In particular, the combination of ethacrynic acid and flurbiprofen in 3 overcomes cisplatin&#8208;based resistance and provides strong cancer cell selectivity. Enzyme inhibition assays on human GST P1 and human COX&#8208;2 and cross&#8208;experiments with complex&#8197;1, analogous to 2&#8211;4 but lacking bio&#8208;groups, revealed a clear synergy between the PtII frame and the bioactive organic components.

         <title>A Streamlined Regenerative Glycosylation Reaction: Direct,&#8201;Acid&#8208;Free Activation of Thioglycosides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct conversion of thioglycosides via the regenerative approach that bypasses the intermediacy of glycosyl bromides and eliminates the need for heavy metal&#8208;based promoters is reported. The direct regenerative activation of thioglycosides is achieved under neutral reaction conditions using only 1&#8197;equiv. NIS and catalytic 3,3&#8208;difluoroxindole (HOFox) without the acidic additives.







Abstract
Our group has previously reported that 3,3&#8208;difluoroxindole (HOFox) is able to mediate glycosylations via intermediacy of OFox imidates. Thioglycoside precursors were first converted into the corresponding glycosyl bromides that were then converted into the OFox imidates in the presence of Ag2O followed by the activation with catalytic Lewis acid in a regenerative fashion. Reported herein is a direct conversion of thioglycosides via the regenerative approach that bypasses the intermediacy of bromides and eliminates the need for heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;based promoters. The direct regenerative activation of thioglycosides is achieved under neutral reaction conditions using only 1&#8197;equiv. NIS and catalytic HOFox without the acidic additives.

         <title>Artificial Water Channels: Towards Biomimetic Membranes for Desalination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Desalination membranes: The prime objective of Artificial Water Channels (AWC) is to explore the naturally evolved water translocation pathways and assess the possibilities of using them as the basis for &#8216;engineered&#8217; desalination processes of enhanced performance. This review proposes to find an easily scalable AWC approach that could be immediately applied to desalination systems to increase their energy efficiency.







Abstract
Natural Aquaporin (AQP) channels are efficient water translocating proteins, rejecting ions. Inspired by this masterpiece of nature, Artificial Water Channels (AWCs) with controlled functional structures, can be potentially used to mimic the AQPs to a certain extent, offering flexible avenues toward biomimetic membranes for water purification. The objective of this paper is to trace the historical development and significant advancements of current reported AWCs. Meanwhile, we attempt to reveal important structural insights and supramolecular self&#8208;assembly principles governing the selective water transport mechanisms, toward innovative AWC&#8208;based biomimetic membranes for desalination.

         <title>Water Formation in Non&#8208;Hydrolytic Sol&#8211;Gel Routes: Selective Synthesis of Tetragonal and Monoclinic Mesoporous Zirconia as a Case Study</title>

Water in non&#8208;hydrolytic sol&#8211;gel: Monitoring in situ water formation in non&#8208;hydrolytic sol&#8211;gel routes to mesoporous zirconia shows that it impacts not only the mechanism of the sol&#8211;gel process but also the structure of the final material.







Abstract
Several non&#8208;hydrolytic sol&#8211;gel syntheses involving different precursors, oxygen donors, and conditions have been screened aiming to selectively produce mesoporous t&#8208;ZrO2 or m&#8208;ZrO2 with significant specific surface areas. The in situ water formation was systematically investigated by Karl Fisher titration of the syneresis liquids. XRD and nitrogen physisorption were employed to characterize the structure and texture of the ZrO2 samples. Significant amounts of water were found in several cases, notably in the reactions of Zr(OnPr)4 with ketones (acetone, 2&#8208;pentanone, acetophenone), and of ZrCl4 with alcohols (benzyl alcohol, ethanol) or acetone. Conversely, the reactions of Zr(OnPr)4 with acetic anhydride or benzyl alcohol at moderate temperature (200&#8201;&#176;C) and of ZrCl4 with diisopropyl ether appear strictly non&#8208;hydrolytic. Although reaction time and reaction temperature were also important parameters, the presence of water played a crucial role on the structure of the final zirconia: t&#8208;ZrO2 is favored in strictly non&#8208;hydrolytic routes, while m&#8208;ZrO2 is favored in the presence of significant amounts of water. 1H and 13C&#8197;NMR analysis of the syneresis liquids allowed us to identify the main reactions responsible for the formation of water and of the oxide network. The morphology of the most interesting ZrO2 samples was further investigated by electron microscopy (SEM, TEM).

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Extended Diaza[7]helicenes by Hybridization of Naphthalene Diimides and Hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Super naphthalene, super helix: A diaza[7]helicene was formed as the only isomer via the fusion of two naphthalene diimides (NDIs) to a hexabenzocorene (HBC) core, generating a fully conjugated superstructure with a wide lateral &#960;&#8208;extension of the inner heterohelix. The helical twist brings along an attractive spatial arrangement and affects the chemical and photophysical features. Isolation of the corresponding enantiomers was accomplished by HPLC on a chiral stationary phase and the absolute configurations were determined by comparison of their circular dichroism spectra with quantum mechanical calculations.







Abstract
The synthesis of an unprecedented, &#960;&#8208;extended hexabenzocorene (HBC)&#8208;based diaza[7]helicene is presented. The target compound was synthesized by an ortho&#8208;fusion of two naphthalene diimide (NDI) units to a HBC&#8208;skeleton. A combination of Diels&#8211;Alder and Scholl&#8208;type oxidation reactions involving a symmetric di&#8208;NDI&#8208;tolane precursor were crucial for the very selective formation of the helical superstructure via a hexaphenyl&#8208;benzene (HPB) derivative. The formation of the diaza[7]helicene moiety in the final Scholl oxidation is favoured, affording the symmetric &#960;&#8208;extended helicene as the major product as a pair of enantiomers. The separation of the enantiomers was successfully accomplished by HPLC involving a chiral stationary phase. The absolute configuration of the enantiomers was assigned by comparison of circular dichroism spectra with quantum mechanical calculations.

         <title>Aromatic Foldamer Helices as &#945;&#8208;Helix Extended Surface Mimetics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different yet alike: Aromatic helices may be designed to display side chain patterns mimicking the surface of an extended &#945;&#8208;helix despite the considerable differences between the geometrical parameters of their backbones.







Abstract
Helically folded aromatic oligoamide foldamers have a size and geometrical parameters very distinct from those of &#945;&#8208;helices and are not obvious candidates for &#945;&#8208;helix mimicry. Nevertheless, they offer multiple sites for attaching side chains. It was found that some arrays of side chains at the surface of an aromatic helix make it possible to mimic extended &#945;&#8208;helical surfaces. Synthetic methods were developed to produce quinoline monomers suitably functionalized for solid phase synthesis. A dodecamer was prepared. Its crystal structure validated the initial design and showed helix bundling involving the &#945;&#8208;helix&#8208;like interface. These results open up new uses of aromatic helices to recognize protein surfaces and to program helix bundling in water.

A better model: The encapsulation of a coordination complex in a dynamic hydrogen bonded capsule exhibits several features present in metalloenzymes such as the isolation of the metal centre from the bulk solvent while maintaining guest exchanges, a well&#8208;defined second coordination sphere, and acid/base residues close to the metal centre.







Abstract
The design of biomimetic models of metalloenzymes needs to take into account many factors and is therefore a challenging task. We propose in this work an original strategy to control the second coordination sphere of a metal centre and its distal environment. A biomimetic complex, reproducing the first coordination sphere, is encapsulated in a self&#8208;assembled hydrogen&#8208;bonded capsule. The cationic complex is co&#8208;encapsulated with its counter&#8208;anion or with solvent molecules. The capsule is dynamic, allowing a fast in/out exchange of the co&#8208;encapsulated species. It also provides both a hydrogen&#8208;bonding site in the second coordination sphere and a source of proton as it can be deprotonated in the presence of the complex, providing a globally neutral host&#8208;guest assembly. This simple and broad scope strategy is unprecedented in biomimetic studies. The approach appears to be a very promising method for the stabilisation of reactive species and for the study of their reactivity.

         <title>Utilization of CO2 Feedstock for Organic Synthesis by Visible&#8208;Light Photoredox Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
A sustainable COOL technique: The fixation of ubiquitous and naturally abundant carbon dioxide as a C1&#8208;feedstock onto organic staples delivering commodity chemicals and consumer products has an impactful influence on sustainable chemistry. This Minireview mainly highlights the emerging reports on CO2 incorporation reactions using light&#8208;harvesting photoredox catalysis for C&#8722;C and C&#8722;X bond&#8208;forming reactions for the synthesis of carboxylic acid derivatives and heterocyclic compounds.







Abstract
CO2 is a highly abundant, green, and sustainable carbon feedstock. Despite its kinetic inertness and thermodynamic stability, the development of various catalytic techniques has enabled the conversion of CO2 to value&#8208;added products such as carboxylic acids, amino acids, and heterocyclic compounds, where visible&#8208;light photocatalysis has emerged to be an efficient promoter of these processes. This Minireview covers the progress in the areas of CO2 incorporation onto organic matters based on the combined venture of renewable resources of CO2 and light energy with significant emphasis on the last three years&#8217; developments.

         <title>Double Orthogonal Click Reactions for the Development of Antimicrobial Peptide Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double clicked amphipathic cyclic peptides assemble in bacteria membranes to form polymeric supramolecular nanotubes, conferring them antimicrobial properties.







Abstract
A new class of amphipathic cyclic peptides, which assemble in bacteria membranes to form polymeric supramolecular nanotubes giving them antimicrobial properties, is described. The method is based on the use of two orthogonal clickable transformations to incorporate different hydrophobic or hydrophilic moieties in a simple, regioselective, and divergent manner. The resulting cationic amphipathic cyclic peptides described in this article exhibit strong antimicrobial properties with a broad therapeutic window. Our studies suggest that the active form is the nanotube resulted from the parallel stacking of the cyclic peptide precursors. Several techniques, CD, FTIR, fluorescence, and STEM, among others, confirm the nanotube formation.

         <title>Gram&#8208;Scale Synthesis of the 1,1,n,n&#8208;Tetramethyl[n](2,11)teropyrenophanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Performance under strain: A large&#8208;scale synthetic route to a series of four [n](2,11)teropyrenophanes (n=7&#8211;10) has been developed, which delivered the three smallest homologues on a &gt;1&#8197;g scale and enabled the first synthesis of the highest homologue. The synthetic pathway culminates with a teropyrene&#8208;forming cyclodehydrogenation, for which two sets of conditions had to be developed as a result of the broad range of strain (38.7&#8211;61.8&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) in these bow&#8208;shaped cyclophanes.







Abstract
A gram&#8208;scale synthesis of a series of 1,1,n,n&#8208;tetramethyl[n](2,11)teropyrenophanes (n=7&#8211;9) has been accomplished as well as the first synthesis of the next higher homologue 1,1,10,10&#8208;tetramethyl[10](2,11)teropyrenophane. The scale&#8208;up of the original small&#8208;scale synthesis required the development of several heavily modified synthetic methods, including a chlorination/Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation protocol and an iodination/Wurtz coupling protocol, which were performed on 25&#8211;30&#8197;g and 30&#8211;60&#8197;g scales, respectively. Two separate sets of conditions for the key teropyrene&#8208;forming cyclodehydrogenation reaction at the end of the synthetic pathway were developed, an acid&#8208;promoted one for the two less strained congeners and an acid&#8208;free method for the two more strained homologues.

         <title>Photoactive Nickel Complexes in Cross&#8208;Coupling Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;excited about Ni: Photophysically and photochemically relevant aspects of light&#8208;driven cross&#8208;coupling reactions by nickel catalysis are reviewed. The importance of energetically low&#8208;lying triplet excited states is highlighted, along with recent key findings in light&#8208;driven nickel catalysis. Essential concepts for the use of photoactive nickel complexes in organic synthesis are identified.







Abstract
Transition metal catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions are important in chemical synthesis for the formation of C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bonds. Suitable catalysts are frequently based on palladium or nickel, and lately the cheaper and more abundant first&#8208;row transition metal element has been much in focus. The combination of nickel catalysis with photoredox chemistry has opened new synthetic possibilities, and in some cases electronically excited states of nickel complexes play a key role. This is a remarkable finding, because photo&#8208;excited metal complexes are underexplored in the context of organic bond&#8208;forming reactions, and because the photophysics and the photochemistry of first&#8208;row transition metal complexes are underdeveloped in comparison with their precious metal&#8208;based congeners. Consequently, there is much potential for innovation at the interface of synthetic&#8208;organic and physical&#8208;inorganic chemistry. This Minireview highlights recent key findings in light&#8208;driven nickel catalysis and identifies essential concepts for the exploitation of photoactive nickel complexes in organic synthesis.

         <title>Silica&#8208;Supported Phosphine&#8211;Gold Complexes as an Efficient Catalytic System for a Dearomative Spirocyclization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Working together! Phosphine&#8211;gold complexes grafted onto chiral silica nanohelices, in cooperation with silver triflate, exhibit a high reactivity in various reactions, including the spirocyclization of aryl alkynoate esters. The heterogeneous catalysts could be easily recovered and recycled for up to 25 cycles without any loss of efficiency by adding more silver triflate every seventh cycle. A complex catalytic mechanism based on silica and metallic species is probably responsible for the high efficiency.







Abstract
The combination of metal catalyst and inorganic silica frameworks provides a greener approach to recyclable catalysis. In this study, three phosphine&#8211;gold chloride complexes have been successfully covalently grafted onto chiral silica nanohelices. The resulting 3D ensembles showed chiroptical properties that allowed the monitoring of the supported ligands. The heterogeneous gold chloride catalysts in cooperation with silver triflate exhibited high reactivity in various reactions, especially in the spirocyclization of aryl alkynoate esters, for which a catalytic loading of 0.05&#8201;mol&#8201;% could be employed. The heterogeneous catalysts could be easily recovered and recycled seven or eight times without any loss of efficiency. By adding more silver triflate, 25 cycles with full conversion were achieved owing to a complex catalytic system based on silica and metallic species.

The heterogeneous gold chloride catalysts in cooperation with silver triflate exhibited high reactivity in various reactions, especially in the spirocyclization of aryl alkynoate esters, for which a catalytic loading of 0.05&#8201;mol&#8201;% could be employed. The heterogeneous catalysts could be easily recovered and recycled seven or eight times without any loss of efficiency. By adding more silver triflate, 25 cycles with full conversion were achieved owing to a complex catalytic system based on silica and metallic species.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Extended Diaza[7]helicenes by Hybridization of Naphthalene Diimides and Hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronen based diaza[7]helicene was synthesized featuring a wide lateral &#960;&#8208;extension of the inner helix. This was guaranteed by hybridization with two naphthaleneimide moieties. The helical superstructure was formed as the only isomer during final Scholl oxidation with remarkable selectivity. Successful separation of the enantiomers allowed for the detailed analysis of the chemical, optical and chiroptical properties, which were supported by quantum mechanical calculations. The cover image was designed by Cornelius Weiss. More information can be found in the Full Paper by A. Hirsch et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202003402).

Dancing people parade along the rings: The cover image depicts the movement of electrons on tetracyclic &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems under a magnetic field. While the annulation of benzene rings with a pentalene moiety resulted in the local aromatic character in the six&#8208;membered rings, the thiophene&#8208;fused analog retains the pronounced antiaromatic character of pentalene moiety. The fused thiophene rings also offer sufficient stability to the antiaromatic pentalene even without bulky substituents, enabling the formation of aggregates.

Dumbbell&#8208;shaped bipyridines, featuring distal steric effects of bipyridine C5&#8208; and C5&#8217;&#8208;triarylmethyl substituents, allowed controlled monochelation to transition metals. These newly synthesized ligands showed improved ligand performance compared to conventional bipyridine ligands in the Ni&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling and the Ni/photoredox&#8208;synergistically catalyzed decarboxylative coupling.

Ag+ ions as chemical stimuli to control naphthalene diimide encapsulation and photoinduced electron transfer in porphyrin containers.







Abstract
The complexation processes of N,N&#8217;&#8208;dibutyl&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalene diimide (NDI) into two types of &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;rich molecular containers consisting of two Zn(II)&#8208;porphyrins connected by four flexible linkers of two different lengths, were characterized by means of absorption and emission spectroscopies and molecular dynamics simulation. Notably, the addition of NDI leads to a strong quenching of the fluorescence of both cages only when they are in an open conformation suitable for guest encapsulation, a situation triggered by silver(I) ions binding to the lateral triazoles. Molecular dynamics simulations confirm the fast binding of NDI, likely assisted by NDI&#8208;silver(I) interactions. Upon NDI complexation, the two porphyrin macrocycles get closer, with an optimized face to face orientation, suggesting an induced&#8208;fit mechanism through &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions with the NDI aromatic cycle. Ultrafast transient absorption experiments allowed to identify the process of quenching of the Zn&#8208;porphyrin fluorescence as an efficient photoinduced electron transfer reaction between the cage porphyrin and the included NDI guest. The process occurs on fast and ultrafast time scales in the two complexes (1.5&#8197;ps and &#8804;300&#8197;fs) leading to a short&#8208;lived charge separated state (charge recombination lifetimes in the order of 30&#8211;40&#8197;ps). The combined computational and experimental approach used here is able to furnish a reliable model of the NDI&#8208;cage complexation mechanism and of the corresponding electron transfer reaction, attesting the allosteric control of both processes by the silver(I) ions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complexation processes of N,N&#8217;&#8208;dibutyl&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalene diimide (&lt;b&gt;NDI&lt;/b&gt;) into two types of &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;rich molecular containers consisting of two Zn(II)&#8208;porphyrins connected by four flexible linkers of two different lengths, were characterized by means of absorption and emission spectroscopies and molecular dynamics simulation. Notably, the addition of &lt;b&gt;NDI&lt;/b&gt; leads to a strong quenching of the fluorescence of both cages only when they are in an open conformation suitable for guest encapsulation, a situation triggered by silver(I) ions binding to the lateral triazoles. Molecular dynamics simulations confirm the fast binding of &lt;b&gt;NDI&lt;/b&gt;, likely assisted by &lt;b&gt;NDI&lt;/b&gt;&#8208;silver(I) interactions. Upon &lt;b&gt;NDI&lt;/b&gt; complexation, the two porphyrin macrocycles get closer, with an optimized face to face orientation, suggesting an induced&#8208;fit mechanism through &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions with the &lt;b&gt;NDI&lt;/b&gt; aromatic cycle. Ultrafast transient absorption experiments allowed to identify the process of quenching of the Zn&#8208;porphyrin fluorescence as an efficient photoinduced electron transfer reaction between the cage porphyrin and the included &lt;b&gt;NDI&lt;/b&gt; guest. The process occurs on fast and ultrafast time scales in the two complexes (1.5&#8197;ps and &#8804;300&#8197;fs) leading to a short&#8208;lived charge separated state (charge recombination lifetimes in the order of 30&#8211;40&#8197;ps). The combined computational and experimental approach used here is able to furnish a reliable model of the &lt;b&gt;NDI&lt;/b&gt;&#8208;cage complexation mechanism and of the corresponding electron transfer reaction, attesting the allosteric control of both processes by the silver(I) ions.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Supramolecular Paradigm for Capture and Co&#8208;Precipitation of Gold(III) Coordination Complexes</title>

Acyclic organic compounds reliably form a set of directional non&#8208;covalent interactions with HAuX4 that enable gold recovery or crystal engineering of gold composites.







Abstract
A new supramolecular paradigm is presented for reliable capture and co&#8208;precipitation of haloauric acids (HAuX4) from organic solvents or water. Two classes of acyclic organic compounds act as complementary receptors (tectons) by forming two sets of directional non&#8208;covalent interactions, (a)&#8197;hydrogen bonding between amide (or amidinium) NH residues and the electronegative X ligands on the AuX4&#8722;, and (b)&#8197;electrostatic stacking of the electron deficient Au center against the face of an aromatic surface. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of four co&#8208;crystal structures reveals the additional common feature of proton bridged carbonyls as a new and predictable supramolecular design element that creates one&#8208;dimensional polymers linked by very short hydrogen bonds (CO&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;OC distance &lt;2.5&#8197;&#197;). Two other co&#8208;crystal structures show that the amidinium&#8208;&#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;XAu interaction will reliably engage AuX4&#8722; with high directionality. These acyclic compounds are very attractive as co&#8208;precipitation agents within new &#8220;green&#8221; gold recovery processes. They also have high potential as tectons for controlled self&#8208;assembly or co&#8208;crystal engineering of haloaurate composites. More generally, the supramolecular paradigm will facilitate the design of next&#8208;generation receptors or tectons with high affinity for precious metal square planar coordination complexes for use in advanced materials, nanotechnology, or medicine.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Induced Nucleophilic Ring Opening of Donor&#8211;Acceptor Cyclopropenes for Synthesis of Monosubstituted Succinic Acid Derivatives</title>

Silyl protected &#947;&#8208;substituted enoldiazo compounds under RhII catalysis generate 1,2,3&#8208;trisubstituted donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropenes that undergo catalyst free or DMAP&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic Favorskii&#8208;type ring opening with aliphatic amines, hydrazines, anilines, alcohols and thiols to afford a series of amido&#8208;esters, mixed diesters and diamides, including &#945;&#8208;substituted tetrahydropyridazine&#8208;3,6&#8208;diones and pyrrolidine&#8208;2,5&#8208;diones, in high yields.







Abstract
1,2,3&#8208;Trisubstituted donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropenes (DACPs) generated in situ from enoldiazo compounds react with nucleophiles to form &#945;&#8208;substituted succinic acid derivatives in high yields. Initial dirhodium(II) carboxylate catalysis rapidly converts enoldiazo&#8208;acetates or &#8208;acetamides to DACPs that undergo catalyst&#8208;free Favorskii ring opening with amines, and also with anilines, alcohols, and thiols, when facilitated by catalytic amounts of 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). This methodology provides easy access to mixed esters and amides of monosubstituted succinic acids, including derivatives of naturally occurring compounds. It also affords dihydrazide, dihydroxamic acid, and diamide derivatives, as well as &#945;&#8208;substituted tetrahydropyridazine&#8208;3,6&#8208;diones in high yields. Attempts to generate optically enriched DACPs were not successful because their populations having the R and S configurations formed with a chiral dirhodium catalyst are quite similar, and the loss of enantiocontrol likely originates from the DACP ring forming step which is reversible with its intermediate metal carbene.

         <title>Tunable Phosphorescence/Fluorescence Dual Emissions of Organic Isoquinoline&#8208;Benzophenone Doped Systems by Alkoxy Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual emission: A new organic host&#8211;guest&#8208;doped system with dual emissions of strong fluorescence and room temperature phosphorescence was developed, in which the isoquinoline derivative with alkoxy chain was selected as the guest and benzophenone was chosen as the host.







Abstract
Dual/multi&#8208;component organic doped systems with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) properties have been developed. However, the unknown luminescence mechanism still greatly limits the development of the doped materials. Herein, a new doped system exhibiting phosphorescence/fluorescence dual emission (&#934;phos=4&#8211;24&#8201;% and &#964;phos=101&#8211;343&#8197;ms) is successfully constructed through prediction and design. A series of isoquinoline derivatives with different alkoxy chains were selected as the guests. Benzophenone was chosen as the host owing to the characteristics of low melting point and good crystallinity. The alkoxy chain lengths of the guests are first reported to be used to control the fluorescence and phosphorescence intensities of the doped materials, which results in different prompt emission colors. Additionally, the doped ratio of the guest and host can also control the luminous intensities of the materials. In particular, the doped materials still exhibit phosphorescent properties even if the ratio of the guest/host is as low as 1:100&#8201;000.

Flip the light on: The iron(II) salt [Fe(bpp)2](isonicNO)2&#8901;2.4&#8201;H2O (bpp=2,6&#8208;bis(pyrazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)pyridine; isonicNO=isonicotinate N&#8208;oxide anion) undergoes spin crossover near room temperature (T1/2&#8593;=274.9&#8197;K; T1/2&#8595;=273.8&#8197;K) in an exceptionally abrupt manner (the fraction of HS Fe2+ cations &#947;HS changes from 1 to 0 in less than 3&#8197;K). This triggers a hydrogen&#8208;bond isomerization in the solid state that can be reversed by temperature change or under light irradiation.







Abstract
The spin crossover salt [Fe(bpp)2](isonicNO)2&#8901; 2.4&#8201;H2O (1&#8901;2.4&#8201;H2O) (bpp=2,6&#8208;bis(pyrazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)pyridine; isonicNO=isonicotinate N&#8208;oxide anion) exhibits a very abrupt spin crossover at T1/2=274.4&#8197;K. This triggers a supramolecular linkage (H&#8208;bond) isomerization that responds reversibly towards light irradiation or temperature change. Isotopic effects in the thermomagnetic behavior reveal the importance of hydrogen bonds in defining the magnetic state. Further, the title compound can be reversibly dehydrated to afford 1, a material that also exhibits spin crossover coupled to H&#8208;bond isomerization, leading to strong kinetic effects in the thermomagnetic properties.

         <title>Effect of the PHY Domain on the Photoisomerization Step of the Forward Pr&#8594;Pfr Conversion of a Knotless Phytochrome</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
More reactive, more efficient: The influence of the PHY domain on the photoconversion of a knotless phytochrome was investigated. The interaction of its &#8220;tongue&#8221; region with the GAF domain keeps the bilin chromophore and the binding pocket in a more reactive conformation. This results in accelerated reorganization of the protein environment necessary to accommodate the photoisomerization of the chromophore and, in effect, in an increased overall quantum efficiency.







Abstract
Phytochrome photoreceptors operate via photoisomerization of a bound bilin chromophore. Their typical architecture consists of GAF, PAS and PHY domains. Knotless phytochromes lack the PAS domain, while retaining photoconversion abilities, with some being able to photoconvert with just the GAF domain. Therefore, we investigated the ultrafast photoisomerization of the Pr state of a knotless phytochrome to reveal the effect of the PHY domain and its &#8220;tongue&#8221; region on the transduction of the light signal. We show that the PHY domain does not affect the initial conformational dynamics of the chromophore. However, it significantly accelerates the consecutively induced reorganizational dynamics of the protein, necessary for the progression of the photoisomerization. Consequently, the PHY domain keeps the bilin and its binding pocket in a more reactive conformation, which decreases the extent of protein reorganization required for the chromophore isomerization. Thereby, less energy is lost along nonproductive reaction pathways, resulting in increased efficiency.

Cyclic alkyl(amino) carbene (cAAC)&#8208;stabilized oligomeric alkali metal&#8208;phosphinidenides have been isolated and characterized in the solid state upon reduction of chlorophophinidenes.







Abstract
Cyclic alkyl(amino) carbene (cAAC)&#8208;supported, structurally diverse alkali metal&#8208;phosphinidenides 2&#8211;5 of general formula ((cAAC)P&#8208;M)n(THF)x [2: M=K, n=2, x=4; 3: M=K, n=6, x=2; 4: M=K, n=4, x=4; 5: M=Na, n=3, x=1] have been synthesized by the reduction of cAAC&#8208;stabilized chloro&#8208;phosphinidene cAAC=P&#8208;Cl (1) utilizing metallic K or KC8 and Na&#8208;naphthalenide as reducing agents. Complexes&#8197;2&#8211;5 have been structurally characterized in solid state by NMR studies and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The proposed mechanism for the electron transfer process has been well&#8208;supported by cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The solid state oligomerization process has been observed to be largely dependent on the ionic radii of alkali metal ions, steric bulk of cAAC ligands and solvation/de&#8208;solvation/recombination of the dimeric unit [(cAAC)P&#8208;M(THF)x]2.

         <title>Regiospecific Synthesis of Calcium&#8208;Independent Daptomycin Antibiotics Using a Chemoenzymatic Method</title>

         <dc:description>Daptomycin (DAP) is a calcium (Ca2+)&#8208;dependent FDA&#8208;approved antibiotic drug for the treatment of Gram&#8208;positive infections. It possesses a complex pharmacophore hampering derivatization and/or synthesis of analogs. In order to mimic the Ca2+&#8208;binding effect we uses a chemoenzymatic approach to modify the tryptophan (Trp) residue of DAP and synthesize kinetically characterized and structurally elucidated regiospecific Trp&#8208;modified DAP analogs. We demonstrated that the modified DAPs are several&#8208;folds active than the parent molecule against antibiotic&#8208;susceptible and antibiotic&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. Strikingly and in contrast to the parent molecule, the DAP derivatives do not rely on calcium or any additional elements for activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium(III) Sensitizers and Energy Upconversion: The Influence of Ligand Structure Upon TTA&#8208;UC Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Six substituted ligands based upon 2&#8208;(naphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;yl)quinoline&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylate and 2&#8208;(naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)quinoline&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylate have been synthesized in two steps from a range of commercially available isatin derivatives. These species are demonstrated to be effective cyclometalating ligands for Ir(III) yielding complexes of the form [Ir(C^N)2(bipy)]PF6 (where C^N = cyclometalating ligand; bipy = 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine). X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies on three examples demonstrate that the complexes adopt a distorted octahedral geometry wherein a cis&#8208;C,C and trans&#8208;N,N coordination mode is observed. Intra&#8208;ligand torsional distortions are evident in all cases. The Ir(III) complexes display photoluminescence in the red part of the visible region (668&#8208;693 nm) which is modestly tuneable via the ligand structure. The triplet lifetimes of the complexes are clearly influenced by the precise structure of the ligand in each case. Supporting computational (DFT) studies suggest that the differences in observed triplet lifetime are likely due to differing admixtures of ligand&#8208;centred versus MLCT character instilled by the facets of the ligand structure. Triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) measurements demonstrate that the complexes based upon the 1&#8208;naphthyl derived ligands are viable photosensitizers with upconversion quantum efficiencies of 1.6&#8208;6.7%.</dc:description>

         <title>A high&#8208;efficiency hematite photoanode with enhanced bonding energy around Fe atoms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hematite nanoarray is an important photoanode materials. However, it suffers from serious problems of charge transfer and surface states, especially the surface states hinder the increase of photocurrent. Previous strategy to suppress the surface state is the deposition of Fe&#8208;free metal oxide overlayer. Herein, from the viewpoint of atomic bonding energy, we discover that the strength of bonding around Fe atoms in the hematite is the keypoint to suppress the surface states. By treating the surface of hematite with Se and NaBH  4  , the Fe  2  O  3  transfers to be a double&#8208;layer nanostructure.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hematite nanoarray is an important photoanode materials. However, it suffers from serious problems of charge transfer and surface states, especially the surface states hinder the increase of photocurrent. Previous strategy to suppress the surface state is the deposition of Fe&#8208;free metal oxide overlayer. Herein, from the viewpoint of atomic bonding energy, we discover that the strength of bonding around Fe atoms in the hematite is the keypoint to suppress the surface states. By treating the surface of hematite with Se and NaBH  4  , the Fe  2  O  3  transfers to be a double&#8208;layer nanostructure. In the outer layer, the Fe&#8208;O bonding is reinforced and the Fe&#8208;Se bonding is even stronger. Therefore, the surface states are inhibited and the increase of the photocurrent density becomes much faster. Besides, the treatment construct a nanoscale p&#8208;n junction to promote the charge transfer. Improvements are achieved in onset potential (0.25 V shift) and in photocurrent density (5.8 times). This work pinpoints the keypoint to suppress the surface states and prepare high&#8208;efficiency hematite nanoarray, and deepens our understanding of the hematite photoanode.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Trifluoromethylation of Alcohols Using a Hypervalent Iodosulfoximine Reagent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct trifluoromethylation of a variety of aliphatic alcohols using a hypervalent iodosulfoximine reagent affords the corresponding ethers in moderate to good yields (14&#8208;72%). Primary, secondary and even tertiary alcohols, including examples derived from natural products, undergo this transformation in the presence of catalytic amounts of zinc bis(triflimide). Typical reaction conditions involve a neat mixture of 6.0 equivalents of the alcohol with 1.0 equivalent of the reagent, with the majority of reactions complete within 2 h with 2.5 mol&#8208;% of the Lewis acid catalyst. Furthermore, we provide experimental evidence that the C&#8211;O bond&#8208;forming process occurs&#160; via &#160;the coordination of the alcohol to the iodine atom and subsequent reductive elimination.</dc:description>

         <title>Isomers of B&#8592;N&#8208;Fused Dibenzo&#8208;azaacenes: How B&#8592;N Affects Opto&#8208;electronic Properties and Device Behaviors?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>B&#8592;N unit has a large dipole and is isoelectronic to C&#8210;C moiety with no dipole. Incorporating B&#8592;N units to &#960;&#8208;conjugated system is a powerful strategy to design organic small molecules and polymers with intriguing opto&#8208;electronic properties and excellent opto&#8208;electronic device performance. However, it is unclear how B&#8592;N unit affects electronic structures and opto&#8208;electronic properties of large &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules. In this work, to address this question, we develop three dibenzo&#8208;azaacene molecules incorporated with two B&#8592;N units at different positions. Although the dibenzo&#8208;azaacene skeleton is fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated, the effect of B&#8592;N unit on the electronic structures of the adjacent rings is much stronger than that of the distant rings. As a result, the three molecules with isomerized B&#8592;N incorporation patterns possess different electronic structures and exhibit tunable opto&#8208;electronic properties. Among the three molecules, the centrosymmetrical molecule exhibits higher LUMO/HOMO energy levels than those of the two axisymmetrical molecules. When used as the active layer in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs), while the two axisymmetrical molecules show unipolar electron transporting property, the centrosymmetrical molecule exhibits ambipolar hole and electron transporting behavior. This work not only deepens our understanding on organoboron &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules, but also indicates a new strategy to tune opto&#8208;electronic properties of organic semiconductors for excellent device performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Insights into LiAlH4 Catalyzed Imine Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
LiAlH4 catalysis: A combined experimental and theoretical investigation on LiAlH4 catalyzed imine hydrogenation reveals mechanistic details as well as metal and substrate effects.







Abstract
Commercial LiAlH4 can be used in catalytic quantities in the hydrogenation of imines to amines with H2. Combined experimental and theoretical investigations give deeper insight in the mechanism and identifies the most likely catalytic cycle. Activity is lost when Li in LiAlH4 is exchanged for Na or K. Exchanging Al for B or Ga also led to dramatically reduced activities. This indicates a heterobimetallic mechanism in which cooperation between Li and Al is crucial. Potential intermediates on the catalytic pathway have been isolated from reactions of MAlH4 (M=Li, Na, K) and different imines. Depending on the imine, double, triple or quadruple imine insertion has been observed. Prolonged reaction of LiAlH4 with PhC(H)=NtBu led to a side&#8208;reaction and gave the double insertion product LiAlH2[N]2 ([N]=N(tBu)CH2Ph) which at higher temperature reacts further by ortho&#8208;metallation of the Ph ring. A DFT study led to a number of conclusions. The most likely catalyst for hydrogenation of PhC(H)=NtBu with LiAlH4 is LiAlH2[N]2. Insertion of a third imine via a heterobimetallic transition state has a barrier of +23.2&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 (&#916;H). The rate&#8208;determining step is hydrogenolysis of LiAlH[N]3 with H2 with a barrier of +29.2&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. In agreement with experiment, replacing Li for Na (or K) and Al for B (or Ga) led to higher calculated barriers. Also, the AlH4&#8722; anion showed very high barriers. Calculations support the experimentally observed effects of the imine substituents at C and N: the lowest barriers are calculated for imines with aryl&#8208;substituents at C and alkyl&#8208;substituents at N.

         <title>Tuning the Thermal Stability and Photoisomerization of Azoheteroarenes through Macrocycle Strain**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking the strain: The thermal relaxation and photoisomerization of bridged azoheteroarenes based on 3&#8208;pyrazole and 2&#8208;imidazole have been investigated computationally, revealing the impact of the bridge length on the thermal stability, half&#8208;life time, kinetics, and the preferred pathway for this class of molecules.







Abstract
Azobenzene and its derivatives are one of the most widespread molecular scaffolds used in a range of modern applications, as well as in fundamental research. After photoexcitation, azo&#8208;based photoswitches revert back to the most stable isomer on a timescale (
) that determines the range of potential applications. Attempts to bring 
 to extreme values prompted the development of azobenzene and azoheteroarene derivatives that either rebalance the E&#8208; and Z&#8208;isomer stabilities, or exploit unconventional thermal isomerization mechanisms. In the former case, one successful strategy has been the creation of macrocycle strain, which tends to impact the E/Z stability asymmetrically, and thus significantly modify
. On the bright side, bridged derivatives have shown an improved optical switching owing to the higher quantum yields and absence of degradation. However, in most (if not all) cases, bridged derivatives display a reversed thermal stability (more stable Z&#8208;isomer), and smaller 
 than the acyclic counterparts, which restricts their potential interest to applications requiring a fast forward and backwards switch. In this paper, the impact of alkyl bridges on the thermal stability of phenyl&#8208;azoheteroarenes is investigated by using computational methods, and it is revealed that it is indeed possible to combine such improved photoswitching characteristics while preserving the regular thermal stability (more stable E&#8208;isomer), and increased 
 values under the appropriate connectivity and bridge length.

         <title>Electrochemical C&#8722;H Amidation of Heteroarenes with N&#8208;Alkyl Sulfonamides in Aqueous Medium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Heterocycles: Metal&#8208;free electrochemical dehydrogenative C&#8722;H amidation of heteroarenes with N&#8208;alkylsulfonamides have been accomplished. The catalyst&#8208; and chemical oxidant&#8208;free C&#8722;H amidation featured ample substrate scope and employed electricity as the sole oxidant (see scheme).







Abstract
The construction of C&#8722;N bonds by free radical reactions represents a powerful synthetic approach for direct C&#8722;H amidations of arenes or heteroarenes. Developing efficient and more environmentally friendly synthetic methods for C&#8722;H amidation reactions remains highly desirable. Herein, metal&#8208;free electrochemical oxidative dehydrogenative C&#8722;H amidations of heteroarenes with N&#8208;alkylsulfonamides have been accomplished. The catalyst&#8208; and chemical&#8208;oxidant&#8208;free C&#8722;H amidation features an ample scope and employs electricity as the green and sole oxidant. A variety of heteroarenes, including indoles, pyrroles, benzofuran and benzothiophene, thereby underwent this C(sp2)&#8722;H nitrogenation. Cyclic voltammetry studies and control experiments provided evidence for nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals being directly generated under metal&#8208;free electrocatalysis.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The construction of C&#8722;N bonds by free radical reactions represents a powerful synthetic approach for direct C&#8722;H amidations of arenes or heteroarenes. Developing efficient and more environmentally friendly synthetic methods for C&#8722;H amidation reactions remains highly desirable. Herein, metal&#8208;free electrochemical oxidative dehydrogenative C&#8722;H amidations of heteroarenes with &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;alkylsulfonamides have been accomplished. The catalyst&#8208; and chemical&#8208;oxidant&#8208;free C&#8722;H amidation features an ample scope and employs electricity as the green and sole oxidant. A variety of heteroarenes, including indoles, pyrroles, benzofuran and benzothiophene, thereby underwent this C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H nitrogenation. Cyclic voltammetry studies and control experiments provided evidence for nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals being directly generated under metal&#8208;free electrocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Group&#8197;6 Hexacarbonyls as Ligands for the Silver Cation: Syntheses, Characterization, and Analysis of the Bonding Compared with the Isoelectronic Group&#8197;5 Hexacarbonylates</title>

Hexacarbonyls as ligands: The molecules M(CO)6 (M=Mo, W) act as ligands towards the silver ion, giving the title compounds [Ag{M(CO)6}2]+[F&#8208;{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; (RF=C(CF3)3). Their structures and bonding have been analyzed and compared with those of the very recently prepared isoelectronic complexes [Ag{M(CO)6}2]&#8722; (M=Nb, Ta).







Abstract
The syntheses of the two novel complexes [Ag{Mo/W(CO)6}2]+[F&#8208;{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; (RF=C(CF3)3) are reported along with their structural and spectroscopic characterization. The X&#8208;ray structure shows that three carbonyl ligands from each M(CO)6 fragment bend towards the silver atom within binding Ag&#8722;C distance range. DFT calculations of the free cations [Ag{M(CO)6}2]+ (M=Cr, Mo, W) in the electronic singlet state give equilibrium structures with C2 symmetry with two bridging carbonyl groups from each hexacarbonyl ligand. Similar structures with C2 symmetry (M=Nb) and D2 symmetry (M=V, Ta) are calculated for the isoelectronic group&#8197;5 anions [Ag{M(CO)6}2]&#8722; (M=V, Nb, Ta). The electronic structure of the cations is analyzed with the QTAIM and EDA&#8208;NOCV methods, which provide detailed information about the nature of the chemical bonds between Ag+ and the {M(CO)6}2q (q = &#8722;2, M = V, Nb, Ta; q = 0, M = Cr, Mo, W) ligands.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Mediated Alcohol Oxidation Coupled to Hydrogen Gas Formation in a Dye&#8208;Sensitized Photosynthesis Cell</title>

         <dc:description>
A dye&#8208;sensitized photoelectrochemical cell (DSPEC) that couples redox&#8208;mediated light&#8208;driven oxidation of benzyl alcohol to reductive H2 formation is reported in this work.

Abstract
This work reports a dye&#8208;sensitized photoelectrochemical cell (DSPEC) that couples redox&#8208;mediated light&#8208;driven oxidative organic transformations to reductive hydrogen (H2) formation. The DSPEC photoanode consists of a mesoporous anatase TiO2 film on FTO (fluorine&#8208;doped tin oxide), sensitized with the thienopyrroledione&#8208;based dye AP11, while H2 was formed at a FTO&#8208;Pt cathode. Irradiation of the dye&#8208;sensitized photoanode transforms 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine 1&#8208;oxyl (TEMPO) to the oxidized TEMPO (TEMPO+), which acts as a chemical oxidant for the conversion of benzyl alcohol. The TEMPO0/+ couple, previously used as redox mediator in DSSC, mediates efficient electron transfer from the organic substrate to the photo&#8208;oxidized dye. A DSPEC photoreactor was designed that allows in situ monitoring the reaction progress by infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatography. Sustained light&#8208;driven oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde within the DSPEC photoreactor, using of TEMPO as mediator, demonstrated the efficiency of the device, with a photocurrent of 0.4&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, approaching quantitative Faradaic efficiency and exhibiting excellent device stability.

         <title>Zinc oxide defect microstructure and surface chemistry derived from oxidation of metallic zinc. Thin film transistor and sensoric behaviour of ZnO films.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc oxide thin films are fabricated by controlled oxidation of sputtered zinc metal films on a hotplate in air at temperatures between 250 and 450&#176;C. The nanocrystalline films possess high relative densities and show preferential growth in (100) orientation. Integration in thin film transistors reveal moderate charge carrier mobilities as high as 0.2 cm  2  /(Vs). The semiconducting properties depend on the calcination temperature, whereby the best performance is achieved at 450 &#176;C. The defect structure of the thin ZnO film can be tracked by Doppler&#8208;broadening positron&#8208;annihilation&#8208;spectroscopy as well as positron&#8208;lifetime studies. Comparably long positron lifetimes suggest interaction of zinc vacancies (V  Zn  ) with one or more oxygen vacancies (V  o  ) in larger structural entities. Such V  O  &#8208;V  Zn  defect clusters act as shallow acceptors and thus reduce the overall electron conductivity of the film. The concentration of these defect clusters decreases at higher calcination temperatures as indicated by changes of the S and W parameters. Such zinc oxide films obtained by conversion of metallic zinc can be also used as seed&#8208;layers for solution&#8208;deposition of zinc oxide nanowires employing a mild microwave&#8208;assisted process. The functionality of the obtained nanowire arrays was tested in a UV sensor device. Best results with respect to sensor sensitivity are achieved with thinner seed layers for device construction.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating the electron&#8208;donating ability of acridine donor units for orange&#8208;red thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters with orange&#8208;red emission is still lagged behind their blue, green and yellow counterparts. Recent researches to address this problem mainly focused on developing new acceptor units. There were few donor units designed especially for orange&#8208;red emitters. Herein, with the benzothiophene fused to the diphenyl acridine donor unit, a new donor moiety, namely BTDPAc, was designed and synthesized. Benefited from the strong electron&#8208;donating ability of the new donor moiety, a new TADF emitter, BTDPAc&#8208;PhNAI, shows an orange&#8208;red emission with its peak at 610 nm in dilute toluene solution. Also, with the help of the diphenyl rings of the donor unit, high photoluminescence quantum yields (&#934;PL) were achieved for BTDPAc&#8208;PhNAI at a wide concentration range. Consequently, the orange&#8208;red OLED based on BTDPAc&#8208;PhNAI achieved a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of nearly 20%, which is comparable to the state&#8208;of&#8208;art device performances with similar emission spectra.</dc:description>

         <title>Replacing the rhamnose&#8211;xylose moiety of QS&#8208;21 with simpler terminal disaccharide units attenuates adjuvant activity in truncated saponin variants</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adjuvants are key immunostimulatory components in vaccine formulations that improve the immune response to the co&#8208;administered antigen. The saponin natural product QS&#8208;21 is one of the most promising immunoadjuvants in the development of vaccines against cancer and infectious diseases but suffers from limitations that have hampered its widespread human use. Previous structure&#8208;activity relationship studies have identified simplified saponin variants with truncated carbohydrate chains, but have not focused on the influence of the linear oligosaccharide domain of QS&#8208;21 in adjuvant activity. Herein we report expeditious 15&#8208;step syntheses of new linear trisaccharide variants of simplified QS&#8208;21&#8208;derived adjuvants in which the complex terminal xylose&#8211;rhamnose moiety has been replaced with commercially available, simpler lactose and cellobiose disaccharides in a &#946;&#8208;anomeric configuration.  In vivo  immunological evaluation of the synthetic saponins showed attenuated antibody responses, highlighting the negative impact of such carbohydrate modifications on adjuvant activity, which could be associated with higher saponin conformational flexibility.</dc:description>

         <title>Emerging Implications of the Concept of Hydricity in Energy&#8208;Relevant Catalytic Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#8216;Hydricity&#8217; of a species refers to its hydride donor ability. The way the p  K  a  concept is useful to determine the extent of proton transfer, the hydricity concept plays a vital role in understanding hydride transfer reactions. A large number of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed processes involve hydride transfer reaction as a key step. Among these, two key reactions &#8211; proton reduction to evolve&#160;H  2  and hydride transfer to CO  2  to generate formate/formic acid &#8211; represent a promising solution to build a sustainable and fossil fuel&#8208;free energy&#8208;economy. Therefore, it is imperative to develop an in&#8208;depth relationship of hydricity of transition metal hydrides to its influencing factors so that efficient and suitable hydride transfer catalysts can be designed. Moreover, such a profound knowledge can also help in improving the existing catalysts in terms of their efficiency and working mechanism. With this broad aim in mind, some important research works have been explored in this area in recent times. This Minireview emphasizes the conceptual approaches developed thus far to tune and apply the hydricity parameter of transition metal hydrides for efficient H  2  evolution and CO  2  reduction/hydrogenation catalysis focusing on the guiding principles for future research toward this direction.</dc:description>

         <title>Dipyrrinato&#8208;Iridium(III) Complexes for an Application in Photodynamic Therapy and Antimicrobial Photodynamic Inactivation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The generation of bio&#8208;targetable photosensitisers is of utmost importance to the emerging field of photodynamic therapy and antimicrobial (photo&#8208;)therapy. A synthetic strategy is presented in which chelating dipyrrin moieties are used to enhance the known photoactivity of iridium(III) metal complexes. Formed complexes can thus be functionalized in a facile manner with a range of targeting groups at their chemically active reaction sites. Dipyrrins with N&#8208; and O&#8208;substituents afforded (dipy)iridium(III) complexes  via  complexation with the respective Cp*&#8208;iridium(III) and ppy&#8208;iridium(III) precursors (dipy = dipyrrinato, Cp* = pentamethyl&#8208;&#951;  5  &#8208;cyclopentadienyl, ppy = 2&#8208;phenylpyridyl). Similarly, electron&#8208;deficient Ir  III  (dipy)(ppy)  2  complexes could be used for post&#8208; functionalization, forming alkenyl, alkynyl and glyco&#8208;appended iridium(III) complexes. The phototoxic activity of these complexes has been assessed in cellular and bacterial assays with and without light; the Ir  III  (Cl)(Cp*)(dipy) complexes and the glyco&#8208;substituted iridium(III) complexes showing particular promise as photomedicine candidates. Representative crystal structures of the complexes are also presented.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In this work, we present a new synthetic strategy for fourfold substituted perylene monoimides via tetrabrominated perylene monoanhydrides. X&#8208;Ray diffraction analysis unveiled intramolecular stacking orientation between the substituents and semicircular packing behavior. We observed remarkable influence of the substituent to the longevity and nature of the excited state upon visible light excitation. In the presence of poly(dehydroalanine)&#8208;graft&#8208;poly(ethylene glycol) graft copolymers as solubilizing template, the chromophores are capable of sensitizing [Mo  3  S  13  ]  2&#8208;  clusters in aqueous solution for stable visible light driven hydrogen evolution over three days.</dc:description>

         <title>Cephalosporin prodrug inhibitors overcome metallo&#8208;b&#8208;lactamase driven antibiotic resistance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The increasing prevalence of metallo&#8208;&#223;&#8208;lactamase (MBL) expressing bacteria presents a worrying trend in antibiotic resistance. MBLs rely on active site zinc ions for their hydrolytic activity and the pursuit of MBL&#8208;inhibitors has therefore involved the investigation of zinc chelators. To ensure that such chelators specifically target MBLs, we prepared a series of cephalosporin prodrugs of two potent zinc&#8208;binders: dipicolinic acid (DPA) and 8&#8208;thioquinoline (8&#8208;TQ). While both DPA and 8&#8208;TQ bind free zinc very tightly (Kd values in the low nM range), the corresponding cephalosporin conjugates do not. The cephalosporin conjugates are efficiently hydrolyzed by MBLs to release DPA or 8&#8208;TQ, as confirmed using both NMR and LC&#8208;MS studies. Notably, the cephalosporin prodrugs of DPA and 8&#8208;TQ show potent inhibitory activity against NDM, VIM, and IMP classes of MBLs and display potent synergy with meropenem against MBL&#8208;expressing clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae and E. coli.</dc:description>

         <title>General synthesis of secondary alkyl amines via reductive alkylation of nitriles by aldehydes and ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of C&#8208;N bond formation reactions is highly desirable due to their importance in biology and chemistry. Recent progress in 3d metal catalysis is indicative of unique selectivity patterns that may permit reactions solving challenges of chemical synthesis. We report here on a catalytic C&#8208;N bond formation reaction &#8211; the reductive alkylation of nitriles. Aldehydes or ketones and nitriles, all abundantly available and low&#8208;cost starting materials, undergo a reductive coupling to form secondary alkyl amines and inexpensive hydrogen is used as the reducing agent. Amines are very important bulk and fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and natural products, and the synthesis of differently substituted secondary alkyl amines is challenging using existing synthesis methodologies. The reaction has a very broad scope and many functional groups, including hydrogenation&#8208;sensitive examples, are tolerated. We have developed a novel catalyst, which is nanostructured, reusable, and easy to handle. The key is the earth&#8208;abundant metal cobalt in combination with a porous support material, N&#8208;doped SiC, synthesized from acrylonitrile and a commercially available polycarbosilane.</dc:description>

         <title>A Domino Fusion of an Organic ligand Depended on Metal&#8208;Induced and Oxygen Insertion, Unraveled by Crystallography, Mass Spectrometry and DFT Calculation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we report the reaction, CH  3  CN at 120 &#176;C, of (1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methanamine (  L1  ) with Co(H  2  O)  6  Cl  2  leading to the 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrakis(1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyrazine (  3  ), isolated as a dimeric cluster {[Co  II  2  (  3  )Cl  4  ]&#8729;2CH  3  CN} (  2  ). When O  2  and H  2  O are present, (1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole&#8208;2&#8208;carbonyl)amide (  HL1'  ) is first formed and crystallized as [Co  III  (  L1  )  2  (  L1'  )]Cl  2  &#8729;2H  2  O (  4  ) before fusion of H  L1'  with  L1  giving 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;(1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;carbonyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;carboxamide (  HL2''  ) forming one&#8208;dimensional (1D) chain of [Co  II  3  (  L2''  )  2  Cl  4  ]  n  (  5  ). The combination of crystallography and mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) of isolated crystals and the solutions taken from the reaction as a function time reveal seven intermediate steps leading to  2  , but six steps for  5  which a different sequence takes place. Control and isotope labeling experiments confirm the two carbonyl oxygen atoms in  5  originate from both air and water. The dependence on the metals, compared to FeCl  3  &#183;6H  2  O leading to a stable triheteroarylmethyl radical, is quite astounding, which could be attributed to the different oxidation states of the metals and coordination modes confirmed by DFT calculations. This metal and valence dependent process is a very useful way for selectively obtaining these large molecules which are unachievable by common organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent cross&#8208;linking of 2H&#8208;MoS2 nanosheets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of 2D materials opens a wide range of possibilities to create new generation structures with multiple applications. Covalently cross&#8208;linked approaches are a ground&#8208;breaking strategy for the formation of homo or heterostructures made by design. However, the covalent assembly of transition metal dichalcogenides flakes is relatively underexplored. Here, a simple covalent cross&#8208;linking method to build 2H&#8208;MoS  2  &#8208;MoS  2  homostructures is described, using commercially available bismaleimides. Theses assemblies are majoritarily connected vertically, basal plane to basal plane, creating specific molecular sized spaces between MoS  2  sheets. This straightforward approach, therefore, gives access to the controlled connection of sulfide&#8208;based 2D materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding the C&#8211;F Bond Activation Mediated by Frustrated Lewis Pairs: Crucial Role of Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The activation of a single C&#8211;F bond in di&#8208; and trifluoromethyl groups by frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) has been computationally explored by means of Density Functional Theory calculations. It is found that in this activation reaction the FLP partners exhibit a peculiar cooperative action, which is markedly different from related FLP&#8208;mediated processes, and where noncovalent interactions established between the Lewis base and the substrate play a decisive role. In addition, the process proceeds through the intermediacy of a hypervalent species featuring a pentacoordinate carbon atom, which is rare in the chemistry of FLPs. The physical factors controlling this process as well as the bonding situation of these hypervalent intermediates have been quantitatively analyzed in detail using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art computational methods to not only rationalize the mechanism of the transformation but also to guide experimentalists towards the realization of these so far elusive hypervalent systems.</dc:description>

         <title>2&#8208; and 2,7&#8208;Substituted para&#8208;N&#8208;Methylpyridinium Pyrenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two  N  &#8208;methylpyridinium compounds and analogous  N  &#8208;protonated salts of 2&#8208; and 2,7&#8208;substituted 4&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;pyrene compounds were synthesised and their crystal structures, photophysical properties both in solution and in the solid state, electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical properties were studied. Upon methylation or protonation, the emission maxima are significantly bathochromically shifted compared to the neutral compounds, although the absorption maxima remain almost unchanged. As a result, the cationic compounds show very large apparent Stokes shifts of up to 7200 cm  &#8208;1  . The  N  &#8208;methylpyridinium compounds have a single reduction at ca. &#8208;1.5 V  vs.  Fc/Fc  +  in MeCN. While the reduction process was reversible for the 2,7&#8208;disubstituted compound, it was irreversible for the mono&#8208;substituted one. Experimental findings are complemented by DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations. Furthermore, the  N  &#8208;methylpyridinium compounds show strong interactions with calf thymus (ct)&#8208;DNA, presumably by intercalation, which paves the way for further applications of these multi&#8208;functional compounds as potential DNA&#8208;bioactive agents.</dc:description>

         <title>New Members of Stuffed tridymite Structure: Synthesis, Structure, SHG, Optical and Multiferroic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We explored the stuffed tridymite structure Ba(Zn/Co)  1&#8208;x  Si  1&#8208;x  M  2x  O  4  (M = Al  3+  and Fe  3+  ) for the possible multiferroic behaviour and to develop new inorganic colored materials. The compounds were synthesized employing conventional solid&#8208;state chemistry methods in the temperature range of 1100&#8211;1175 &#176;C for 24 h. The powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) and Rietveld refinement studies indicate that the compounds stabilize in  P  63 space group (no. 173). The refinement results were also rationalized employing Raman spectroscopic studies.The compounds were found to be SHG active and shows a weak ferroelectric behaviour. The co&#8208;substitution of Co  2+  and Fe  3+  in the structure gives rise to a weak ferromagnetic behaviour to the compound, BaCo  0.75  Si  0.75  Fe  0.5  O  4  , making it a multiferroic material. The optical studies on the prepared compounds exhibited blue color (Co  2+  in T  d  geometry); purple color (Ni  2+  in T  d  geometry) and simultaneous substitution of Co  2+  and Fe  3+  gives rise to blue&#8208;green color due to metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (MMCT) effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic ion speciation during hydrolysis of aryltrifluoroborates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organotrifluoroborates serve as a coupling partner during transmetallation in the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction but require hydrolysis prior to the coupling reaction. Their anionic nature allows study of their hydrolysis by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) by real&#8208;time monitoring, complemented by pH analysis. Induction periods varied according to the borates employed, and a dynamic series of equilibria for numerous ions was observed during hydrolysis. We found that the induction periods and reaction rates were sensitive to the R group of the borates, the shape of reaction vessel, and stir rate.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of High Relaxivity EuII&#8208;Based Contrast Agents for Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Low&#8208;Oxygen Environments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;based contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging present a promising avenue to image hypoxia. Eu  II  &#8208;based contrast agents have a unique biologically relevant redox couple, Eu  II/III  , that distinguishes this metal for use in hypoxia imaging. To that end, we investigated a strategy to enhance the contrast&#8208;enhancing capabilities of Eu  II  &#8208;based cryptates in magnetic resonance imaging by controlling rotational dynamics. Two dimetallic, Eu  II  &#8208;containing cryptates were synthesized to test the efficacy of rigid versus flexible coupling strategies. A flexible strategy to dimerization led to a modest (114%) increase in contrast enhancement per Eu ion (60 MHz, 298 K), but a rigid linking strategy led to an excellent (186%) increase in contrast enhancement despite having the smaller molecular mass of the two dimetallic complexes. We envision the rigid linking strategy to be useful in the future design of potent Eu  II  &#8208;based contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>An Anthracene&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Selective Photo&#8208;Reduction of Carbon Dioxide to Formic Acid Coupled with Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A Zr&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework has been synthesized and employed as a catalyst for photochemical carbon dioxide reduction coupled with water oxidation. The catalyst shows significant carbon dioxide reduction property with concomitant water oxidation. The catalyst has broadband visible light as well as UV light absorption property, which is further confirmed from electronic absorption spectroscopy. We have obtained formic acid as the only reduced product from carbon dioxide with a TOF of 0.69 h  &#8208;1  and oxygen with a TOF of 0.54 h  &#8208;1  . No external photosensitizer is used and the ligand itself acts as the light harvester. So, here we have illustrated efficient and selective photochemical carbon dioxide reduction to formic acid with concomitant water oxidation using Zr&#8208;based MOF as catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyridinic nanographenes by novel precursor design</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>IIn this work we present the solution&#8208;synthesis of pyridine analogues to hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) &#8211; which might be called superpyridines &#8211; via a novel precursor design. The key step in our strategy was the pre&#8209;formation of the C&#8208;C bonds between the 3/3&#8217; positions of the pyridine and the adjacent phenyl rings &#8211; bonds that are otherwise unreactive and difficult to close under Scholl&#8208;conditions. Apart from the synthesis of the parent compound we show that classical pyridine chemistry, namely oxidation, N&#8208;alkylation and metal&#8208;coordination is applicable to the &#960;&#8209;extended analogue. Furthermore, we present basic physical chemical characterizations of the newly synthesized molecules. With this novel synthetic strategy, we hope to unlock the pyridine chemistry of nanographenes</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of Stereochemistry on the Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly Chirality and Gelation Property</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although chiral nanostructures have been fabricated at various structural levels, the transfer and amplification of chirality from molecules to supramolecular self&#8208;assemblies are still puzzling, especially for heterochiral molecules. Herein, four series of C2&#8208;symmetrical dipeptide&#8208;based derivatives bearing various amino acid sequences and different chiralities are designed and synthesized.  The transcription and amplification of molecular chirality to supramolecular assemblies are achieved. The results show that the supramolecular chirality is only determined by the amino acid adjacent to the benzene core and irrespective of the absolute configuration of C&#8208;terminal amino acid.  In addition, the molecular chirality also has a significant influence on their gelation behaviors. For the diphenylalanine&#8208;based gelators, the homochiral gelators can be gelled through conventional heating&#8208;cooling process, while heterochiral gelators form translucent stable gels under sonication. And the racemic gels possess higher mechanical properties than that of pure enantiomers. All these results contribute to an increasing knowledge over control the generation of specific chiral supramolecular structures and the development of new optimized strategies to achieve functional supramolecular organogel through heterochiral and racemic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Twisting versus Delocalization in CAAC&#8208; and NHC&#8208;stabilized Boron&#8208;Based Biradicals: The Roles of Sterics and Electronics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Twisted boron&#8208;based biradicals featuring unsaturated C  2  R  2  (R=Et,Me) bridges and stabilized by cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (CAACs) were recently prepared. These species present remarkable geometrical and electronic differences with respect to their unbridged counterparts. Herein we perform a thorough computational investigation on the origin of their distinct electrostructural properties. We show that steric effects are mostly responsible for the preference of twisted over planar structures. The ground state multiplicity of the twisted structure is modulated by the &#963;&#8208;framework of the bridge, with different R groups leading to distinct multiplicities. In line with the experimental data, a planar structure driven by delocalization effects is observed as global minimum for R=H. The synthetic elusiveness of C  2  R  2  &#8208;bridged systems featuring N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) is also investigated. These results could contribute to the engineering of novel main group biradicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;triggered Nitric Oxide Release Photosensitizer to Combat Bacterial Biofilm Infections</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bacterial biofilms are a serious global health concern, often responsible for persistent infections. New strategies to prevent and treat bacterial infections via eradication of the biofilms are urgently needed. A novel ruthenium&#8208;based compound was reported in this study that functions as both a boronic acid&#8208;decorated photosensitizer (PS) and a light&#8208;triggered nitric oxide (NO) releasing agent. The compound could selectively attach to the bacterial membrane and biofilms. And it is highly potent to eradicate  P. aeruginosa  biofilms via the simultaneous release of NO as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS), which is more effective than clinical antibiotics tobramycin. The compound also has excellent bacterial specificity and shows no significant cytotoxicity to human cells. The results reveal potential applications of this innovative dual&#8208;functional photoactivated ruthenium compound to combat bacterial biofilm infections.</dc:description>

         <title>Permanganyl fluoride: A brief history of the molecule MnO3F and of those who cared for it.*</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Permanganyl fluoride's existence at the stability threshold in the series of oxides and oxide fluorides of the late 3d transition metals is reflected by its experimentally challenging properties and by the difficulties posed in the theoretical description of its bonding characteristics. The history of this molecule is reviewed from early qualitative observations and the growing scattered information on its chemical and physical properties to the accurate determination and interpretation of its molecular structure and spectral features. The still problematic theoretical models for MnO4&#8722; and MnO3F are briefly presented in the broader context of the chemistry of elements in high oxidation states. Short biographies of the scientists engaged in these studies are offered. Related technetium and rhenium compounds are briefly considered for comparison.</dc:description>

         <title>Dimesitylborylethynylated Arenes: Unique Electronic and Photophysical Properties Caused by Ethynediyl (C&#8801;C) Spacers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report synthesis, electrochemical and photophysical properties of aromatic hydrocarbons having one and two dimesitylborylethynyl peripherals&#160;  1  &#160;and&#160;  2  . The mono&#8208; (  1  ) and di&#8208;boryl compounds (  2  ) readily prepared by nucleophilic substitution reaction are fairly stable to air and moisture in the solid&#8208;state. The inserted ethynediyl (C &#8801;C) spacer cancels steric hindrance between the bulky dimesitylboryl groups and the aromatic rings, leading to effective&#160; &#960; &#8208;conjugation over the B &#8208; C &#8801; C &#8208;Ar linkages as revealed by cyclic voltammetry. Despite the small structural differences, photophysical properties of the benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene derivatives were different. Virtually no emission was observed for the benzene derivatives, whereas the anthracene derivatives emitted with high quantum yields both in solution and solid states. Notably, the naphthalene derivatives showed aggregation&#8208;induced emission behavior. Unlike common sterically congested triarylborane derivatives reported so far, the anthracene derivatives showed&#160; &#960; &#8208; &#960; * type absorption and emission bands, which derived from the efficient intramolecular orbital interactions between the boron centers and the anthracene moieties as supported by the density functional calculations. As a result, the dimesitylborylethynyl substituents effectively lowers the LUMO levels of the aromatic hydrocarbon parts while the HOMO levels are almost unaffected, leading to materials with controllable HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of a pyrimidine&#8208;dione derivative with potent inhibitory activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis&#160;ketol&#8208;acid reductoisomerase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New drugs aimed at novel targets are urgently needed to combat the increasing rate of drug resistant tuberculosis (TB). Here, the National Cancer Institute Developmental Therapeutic Program (NCI&#8208;DTP) chemical library was screened against a promising new target, ketol&#8208;acid reductoisomerase (KARI), the second enzyme in the branched chain amino acid (BCAA) biosynthesis pathway. From this library, 6&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;methylthiazolo[4,5&#8208;  d  ]pyrimidine&#8208;5,7(4  H  ,6  H  )&#8208;dione (NSC116565) was identified as a potent time&#8208;dependent inhibitor of  Mycobacterium tuberculosis  (  Mt  ) KARI with a K  i  of 95.4 nM. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) studies showed that this inhibitor binds to Mt KARI in the presence and absence of the co&#8208;factor, NADPH, which was confirmed by crystal structures of the compound in complex with the closely related Staphylococcus aureus (  Sa  ) KARI. We have also shown that NSC116565 inhibits the growth of H37Ra and H37Rv strains of Mt with MIC  50  values of 2.93 &#181;M and 6.06 &#181;M, respectively. These results further validate KARI as a TB drug target and show that NSC116565 is a promising lead for anti&#8208;TB drug development.</dc:description>

         <title>Lewis Acidic Boranes, Lewis Bases, and Equilibrium Constants: A Reliable Scaffold for a Quantitative Lewis Acidity/Basicity Scale</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we developed a quantitative Lewis acidity/basicity scale toward boron&#8208;centered Lewis acids based on a set of 90 experimental equilibrium constants for the reactions of triarylboranes with various O&#8208;, N&#8208;, S&#8208;, and P&#8208;centered Lewis bases in dichloromethane at 20 &#176;C. Analysis with the linear&#8208;free energy relationship lg  K  B  =  LA  B  +  LB  B  allows to calculate equilibrium constants  K  B  for any type of borane/Lewis base combination by the sum of two descriptors, one for Lewis acidity (  LA  B  ) and one for Lewis basicity (  LB  B  ). The resulting Lewis acidity/basicity scale is independent of fixed reference acids/bases and valid toward various types of trivalent boron&#8208;centered Lewis acids. We demonstrate that the newly developed Lewis acidity/basicity scale is easily extendable through linear relationships with quantum&#8208;chemically calculated or common physical&#8208;organic descriptors and known thermodynamic data (&#916;  H  BF3  ). Furthermore, we show that this experimental platform can be utilized for the rational development of borane&#8208;catalyzed reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Activation of CS2 and CO2 by Silylium Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydride&#8208;bridged silylium cation [Et 3 Si&#8208;H&#8208;SiEt 3 ] + , stabilized by the weakly coordinating [Me 3 NB 12 Cl 11 ] &#8208; anion, undergoes, in the presence of excess silane, a series of unexpected consecutive reactions with the valence&#8208;isoelectronic molecules CS 2 and CO 2 . The final products of the reaction with CS 2 are methane and the previously unknown [(Et 3 Si) 3 S] + cation. To gain insight into the entire reaction cascade, numerous experiments with varying conditions were performed, intermediate products were intercepted, and their structures were determined by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Besides the [(Et 3 Si) 3 S] + cation as the final product, crystal structures of [(Et 3 Si) 2 SMe] + , [Et 3 SiS(H)Me] + , and &#160;[Et 3 SiOC(H)OSiEt 3 ] + were obtained. Experimental results combined with supporting quantum&#8208;chemical calculations in gas phase and solution allow a detailed understanding of the reaction cascade.</dc:description>

To gain insight into the entire reaction cascade, numerous experiments with varying conditions were performed, intermediate products were intercepted, and their structures were determined by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Besides the [(Et 3 Si) 3 S] + cation as the final product, crystal structures of [(Et 3 Si) 2 SMe] + , [Et 3 SiS(H)Me] + , and &#160;[Et 3 SiOC(H)OSiEt 3 ] + were obtained. Experimental results combined with supporting quantum&#8208;chemical calculations in gas phase and solution allow a detailed understanding of the reaction cascade.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>How does bridging core modification alter the photovoltaic characteristics of triphenylamine&#8208;based hole transport materials? Theoretical understanding and prediction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskite solar cells have gained immense interest of researchers owing to their high photophysical properties, low&#8208;cost production, and high power conversion efficiencies. Hole transport materials (HTMs) play a dominant role in enhancing the power conversion efficiencies (PCE), and long length diffusion of hole and electron in perovskite solar cells. In hole transport materials, modification of &#960;&#8208;linkers is proved to be an efficient approach for enhancing the overall PCE of perovskite solar cells. In this work, &#960;&#8208;linker modification of recently synthesized H&#8208;Bi molecule (  R  ) is done with novel &#960;&#8208;linkers. After structural modifications, ten novel HTMs (  HB1&#8208;HB10  ) having D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D backbone have been obtained. Structural&#8208;property relationship, optoelectronic and photovoltaic characteristics of newly designed hole transport materials are comprehensively examined and compared with reference molecule. In addition, different geometric parameters are also examined with assist of density functional theory and time dependent&#8208;density functional theory. All designed molecules exhibit narrow HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap (E  g  =2.82&#8208;2.99 eV) as compared to R molecule (E  g  =3.05 eV). Designed molecules expressed red&#8208;shifting in absorption spectra with low values of excitation energy which in return offer high power conversion efficiencies.&#160;Results of all analysis advocate that these novel designed HTMs are ideal aspirant for construction of future high performance perovskite solar cells.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>&#960;&#8208;Coordination of aromatic molecules to metals dramatically alters their reactivity. For example, coordinated carbons become more electrophilic and C&#8208;H bonds of coordinated rings become more acidic.

In this minireview, we describe the key reaction chemistry of arenes coordinated to a range of transition metals, including stereoselective reactions and industrially relevant syntheses.

         <title>Neutral Chiral Tetrakis&#8208;Iodo&#8208;Triazole Halogen&#8208;Bond Donor for Chiral Recognition and Enantioselective Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halogen bonding represents a powerful tool in the field of noncovalent interactions. However, applications in enantioselective recognition and catalysis remain almost nonexistent, due in part to the distinct features of halogen bonds, including long covalent and noncovalent bond distances and high directionality. Herein, we present a novel chiral tetrakis&#8208;iodo&#8208;triazole structure as a neutral halogen bond donor for both chiral anion&#8208;recognition and enantioinduction in ion&#8208;pair organocatalysis. NMR&#8208;titration studies revealed significant differences in anion affinity between the halogen bonding receptor and its hydrogen bonding parent. Selective recognition of chiral dicarboxylates and asymmetric induction in a benchmark organocatalytic reaction were demonstrated using the halogen bond donor. Inversions in the absolute sense of chiral recognition, enantioselectivity, and chiroptical properties relative to the related hydrogen donor were observed. Computational modeling suggested that these effects were the result of distinct anion&#8208;binding modes for the halogen&#8208; versus hydrogen&#8208;bond donors.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Simultaneous Doping of Ceria Nanorods with Cu and Cr on CO Oxidation and NO Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ceria particles play a key role in catalytic applications such as automotive three&#8208;way catalytic systems in which toxic CO and NO are oxidized and reduced to safe CO  2  and N  2  , respectively. In this work, we explore the incorporation of Cu and Cr metals as dopants in the crystal structure of ceria nanorods prepared by a single step hydrothermal synthesis. XRD, Raman and XPS confirm the incorporation of Cu and Cr in the ceria crystal lattices, offering ceria nanorods with a higher concentration of oxygen vacancies. XPS also confirms the presence of Cr and Cu surface species. H  2  &#8208;TPR and XPS analysis show that the simultaneous Cu and Cr co&#8208;doping results in a catalyst with a higher surface Cu concentration and a much&#8208;enhanced surface reducibility, in comparison with either undoped or singly doped (Cu or Cr) ceria nanorods. While single Cu doping enhances catalytic CO oxidation and Cr doping improves catalytic NO reduction, co&#8208;doping with both Cu and Cr enhances the benefits of both dopants in a synergistic manner employing roughly a quarter of dopant weight.</dc:description>

         <title>Doubling F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer Efficiency in Proteins with Extrinsic Thioamide Probes: Implications to Thiomodified Nucleobases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing potential protein&#8208;ligand pair is pivotal not only to track protein structure, dynamics but also to assist in atomistic understanding of drug delivery. Here we report the potentiality of a small model thioamide probe that can be used to study albumin proteins. Monitoring F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) dynamics with the help of fluorescence spectroscopic techniques, we observed two&#8208;fold enhancement in the FRET efficiency in the case of 2&#8208;Thiopyridone (2TPY) compared to its amide analog. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation depicts the relative position of the free energy minima to be quite stable in case of 2TPY via non&#8208;covalent interactions with sulfur which helps for enhancement in the FRET efficiency. Finally, we showed its application by pairing thiouracils with protein. We found that site&#8208;selective sulfur atom substitution approach and non&#8208;covalent interactions with sulfur can substantially enhance the FRET efficiency which can be a potential avenue to explore for designing FRET probes to study structure and dynamics of biomolecules.</dc:description>

         <title>The aggregation pattern of A&#946;1&#8208;40 is altered by the presence of N&#8208;truncated A&#946;4&#8208;40 and/or Cu(II) ions in a similar way via ionic interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease (AD) is one of the most common multifactorial diseases characterized by a range of abnormal molecular processes such as the accumulation of extracellular plaques containing the amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptides and dyshomeostasis of copper in the brain. Herein, we investigate the effect of Cu(II) ions on the aggregation of A&#946;1&#8208;40, and A&#946;4&#8208;40, representing two most prevalent families of A&#946; peptides, full length and N&#8208;truncated ones. Both families are similarly abundant in healthy and AD brains. In either of the studied peptides, substoichiometric Cu(II) concentrations accelerated aggregation, while superstoichiometric Cu(II) inhibited the fibril formation, likely by stabilizing oligomers. The addition of either A&#946;4&#8208;40 or substoichiometric Cu(II) ions affected the aggregation profile of A&#946;1&#8208;40, by yielding shorter and thicker fibrils. The similarity of these two effects can be attributed to the increase of positive charge at the A&#946; N&#8208;terminus, which is caused either by Cu(II) complexation or N&#8208;truncation at position 4. Our findings provide a better understanding of the biological A&#946; aggregation process as these two A&#946; species and Cu(II) ions coexist and interact under physiological conditions.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease (AD) is one of the most common multifactorial diseases characterized by a range of abnormal molecular processes such as the accumulation of extracellular plaques containing the amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptides and dyshomeostasis of copper in the brain. Herein, we investigate the effect of Cu(II) ions on the aggregation of A&#946;1&#8208;40, and A&#946;4&#8208;40, representing two most prevalent families of A&#946; peptides, full length and N&#8208;truncated ones. Both families are similarly abundant in healthy and AD brains. In either of the studied peptides, substoichiometric Cu(II) concentrations accelerated aggregation, while superstoichiometric Cu(II) inhibited the fibril formation, likely by stabilizing oligomers. The addition of either A&#946;4&#8208;40 or substoichiometric Cu(II) ions affected the aggregation profile of A&#946;1&#8208;40, by yielding shorter and thicker fibrils. The similarity of these two effects can be attributed to the increase of positive charge at the A&#946; N&#8208;terminus, which is caused either by Cu(II) complexation or N&#8208;truncation at position 4. Our findings provide a better understanding of the biological A&#946; aggregation process as these two A&#946; species and Cu(II) ions coexist and interact under physiological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemodivergence Between Electrophiles in Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemodivergent cross&#8208;couplings are those in which either one of two (or more) potentially reactive functional groups can be made to react based on choice of conditions. In particular, this review focuses on cross&#8208;couplings involving two different (pseudo)halides that can compete for the role of the electrophilic coupling partner. The discussion is primarily organized by pairs of electrophiles including chloride vs. triflate, bromide vs. triflate, chloride vs. tosylate, and halide vs. halide. Some common themes emerge regarding the origin of selectivity control. These include catalyst ligation state and solvent polarity or coordinating ability. However, in many cases, further systematic studies will be necessary to deconvolute the influences of metal identity, ligand, solvent, additives, nucleophilic coupling partner, and other factors on chemoselectivity.</dc:description>
