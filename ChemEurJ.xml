      <dc:description>Diverse&#160;iridium peptide bioconjugates and the iridium/gold bimetallic complexes have been synthesised starting from the Ir(III) complex [Ir(ppy)  2  (Phen&#8208;5&#8208;COO)] by solid phase peptide synthesis. The selected peptide sequences were an enkephalin derivative TyrGlyGlyPheLeu together with the propargyl&#8208;substituted species TyrGlyPglPheLeu to allow gold coordination, and a short peptide, AlaCysAlaPhen, containing a cysteine residue. Introduction of the gold centre has been achieved via a click reaction with the alkynyl group leading to an organometallic Au&#8208;C(triazole) species, or by direct coordination to the sulfur atom of the cysteine. The photophysical properties of these species revealed predominantly an emission originated from the Ir complex, using mixed metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand and ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer excited states of triplet multiplicity. The formation of the peptide bioconjugates caused a systematic red&#8208;shift of the emission profiles. Lysosomal accumulation was observed for all the complexes, in contrast to the expected mitochondrial accumulation triggered by the gold complexes. Only the cysteine&#8208;containing Ir/Au bioconjugate displayed cytotoxic activity. The absence of activity may be related to the lack of endosomal / lysosomal escape for the cationic peptide conjugates. Interestingly, the different coordination sphere of the gold atom may play a crucial role, as the Au&#8208;S(cysteine) bond may be more readily cleaved in a biological environment than the Au&#8208;C(triazole) bond, and thus the Au fragment could be released from or trapped in the lysosomes, respectively.</dc:description>

      <title>Helical &#947;&#8208;peptide foldamers as dual inhibitors of amyloid&#8208;&#946; peptide and islet amyloid polypeptide oligomerization and fibrillization</title>
      <dc:description>Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD) belong to the 10 deadliest diseases and are sorely lacking in effective treatments. Both pathologies are part of the degenerative disorders named amyloidoses, involving the misfolding and the aggregation of amyloid peptides; hIAPP for T2D and A&#946;  1&#8208;42  for AD. While hIAPP and A&#946;  1&#8208;42  inhibitors have been essentially designed to target &#946;&#8208;sheet rich structures composing the toxic amyloid oligomers and fibrils of these peptides, the strategy aiming at trapping the non&#8208;toxic monomers in their helical native conformation has been rarely explored. We report herein the first example of helical foldamers as dual inhibitors of hIAPP and A&#946;  1&#8208;42  aggregation and able to preserve the monomeric species of both amyloid peptides. A foldamer composed of 4&#8208;amino(methyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;thiazole&#8208;5&#8208;carboxylic acid (ATC) units, adopting a 9&#8208;helix structure reminiscent of 3  10  helix, was remarkable as demonstrated by biophysical assays combining Thioflavin&#8208;T fluorescence, transmission electronic microscopy, capillary electrophoresis and mass spectrometry</dc:description>

      <dc:description>We synthesized a novel tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) derivative substituted with two phenoxy radicals on one 1,3&#8208;dithiole ring, which may have either open&#8208;shell diradical or closed&#8208;shell extended&#8208;quinoidal ground states.

DFT calculations showed the donor&#8211;acceptor type electronic properties of this molecule with well&#8208;separated HOMO&#8211;LUMO distribution and a small HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap. Because of this donor&#8211;acceptor type character, this molecule gave both the dication and the dianion species by electrochemical oxidation and reduction. Furthermore, during the redox process between the neutral and the dication states, this molecule exhibited unique changes in the cyclic voltammogram by repeating the cycles or varying the scan rate. The observed electrochemical behavior was explained by the conformational changes of the electrochemically generated species, and thus indicating that this molecule is classified as a dynamic redox system.</dc:description>

      <title>Recent progresses in aminoglycoside conjugation for RNA targeting: antimicrobials and beyond</title>
      <dc:description>Natural aminoglycosides are therapeutically useful antibiotics as well as very efficient RNA ligands. They are oligosaccharides containing several ammonium groups able to interfere with the translation process in prokaryotes upon binding to bacterial ribosomal RNA (rRNA) thus impairing protein synthesis. Even if aminoglycosides are commonly used in therapy, these RNA binders lack selectivity, being able to bind to a wide number of RNA sequences/structures. This is one of the reasons for their toxicity and limited applications in therapy. At the same time, the ability of aminoglycosides to bind to various RNAs renders them a great source of inspiration for the synthesis of new binders with improved affinity and specificity toward several therapeutically relevant RNA targets. Thus, a number of studies have been performed on these complex and highly functionalized compounds leading to the development of various synthetic methodologies toward the synthesis of conjugated aminoglycosides. The aim of this review is to highlight recent progresses in the field of aminoglycoside conjugation paying particular attention to the modifications performed toward the improvement of affinity and especially to the selectivity of the resulting compounds. This will help readers understand how to introduce a desired chemical modification for future developments of RNA ligands as antibiotics, antiviral and anticancer compounds.</dc:description>

Anti&#8208;cancer drugs endeavors: Thioredoxin system, composed of thioredoxin (TRX), thioredoxin reductase (TR), and NADPH, plays critical roles in many cellular functions. However, it is also overexpressed in many solid tumor cancers. Thus, many inhibitors have been developed to target TR and TRX, such as, natural products, ebselen analogues, metal complexes, and small molecules. We foresee great potential for future efforts towards developing new inhibitors for this system, including protein and peptide&#8208;based inhibitors, as new anti&#8208;cancer drugs.







Abstract
The thioredoxin system is highly conserved system found in all living cells and comprises NADPH, thioredoxin, and thioredoxin reductase. This system plays a critical role in preserving a reduced intracellular environment, and its involvement in regulating a wide range of cellular functions makes it especially vital to cellular homeostasis. Its critical role is not limited to healthy cells, it is also involved in cancer development, and is overexpressed in many cancers. This makes the thioredoxin system a promising target for cancer drug development. As such, over the last decade, many inhibitors have been developed that target the thioredoxin system, most of which are small molecules targeting the thioredoxin reductase C&#8208;terminal redox center. A few inhibitors of thioredoxin have also been developed. We believe that more efforts should be invested in developing protein/peptide&#8208;based inhibitors against both thioredoxin reductase and/or thioredoxin.

      <title>Metallic Glass Films with Nanostructured Periodic Density Fluctuations Supported on Si/SiO2 as an Efficient Hydrogen Sorber</title>
      <dc:description>
Nanostructured (&#8764;50&#8197;nm) Pd&#8208;Au&#8208;Si based metallic glass films (NMGF) on Si/SiO2 have been synthesized as an efficient hydrogen sorber. A significant number of nanovoids originated from PdHx crystals, and an increase in average interatomic spacing is detected in Pd&#8208;Au&#8208;Si NMGF by high&#8208;resolution TEM linked to the unique density fluctuations. This production and characterization methodology allows for the development of metallic glasses with maximum hydrogen uptake via controllable nanovoid formation.

      <title>Catalytic enantioselective synthesis of heterocyclic vicinal fluoroamines using asymmetric protonation: A method development and mechanistic study</title>
      <dc:description>A catalytic enantioselective synthesis of heterocyclic vicinal fluoroamines is reported. A chiral Br&#248;nsted acid promotes aza&#8208;Michael addition to fluoroalkenyl heterocycles to give a prochiral enamine intermediate, which undergoes asymmetric protonation upon rearomatization. The reaction accommodates a range of azaheterocycles and nucleophiles, generating the C&#8211;F stereocenter in high enantioselectivity, and is also amenable to stereogenic C&#8211;CF  3  bonds. Extensive DFT calculations provide evidence for a stereocontrolled proton transfer from the catalyst to substrate as the rate determining step, and show the importance of steric interactions from the catalyst alkyl groups in enforcing high enantioselectivity. Crystal structure data shows the dominance of non&#8208;covalent interactions in the core structure conformation, enabling modulation of the conformational landscape. Ramachandran&#8208;type analysis of conformer distribution and protein data bank mining has indicated benzylic fluorination using this approach has potential for improved potency in several marketed drugs.</dc:description>

      <title>Photoinduced strain&#8208;assisted synthesis of a stiff&#8208;stilbene polymer by ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization</title>
      <dc:description>Developing a novel strategy to synthesis photoresponsive polymers is of significance owing to their potential applications. We report a photoindiced strain&#8208;assisted synthesis of main&#8208;chain stiff&#8208;stilbene polymers using ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) by activating a macrocyclic &#960;&#8208;bond connected to a stiff&#8208;stilbene photoswitch via a linker. Since the linker acts as an external constraint, the photoisomerization to the E&#8208;form leads to the stiff&#8208;stilbene being strained and thus reactive to ROMP. The photoisomerization of E&#8208;form to Z&#8208;form was investigated using time&#8208;dependent NMR studies and UV/Vis spectroscopy. The DFT calculation showed that the E&#8208;form was less stable due to a lack of planarity. By the internal strain developed due to the linker constraint through photoisomerization, the E&#8208;form underwent ROMP by a second generation Grubbs catalyst, while Z&#8208;form did not undergo polymerization under similar conditions. The MALDI&#8208;TOF spectrum of E&#8208;form after polymerization showed the presence of oligomers &gt; 5.2 kDa.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Oxidative stress (OS) is an in&#8208;vivo process leading to free radical overproduction, which triggers polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) peroxidation resulting in the formation of racemic non&#8208;enzymatic oxygenated metabolites. As potential biomarkers of OS, their in&#8208;vivo quantification is of great interest. However, since a large number of isomeric metabolites is formed in parallel, their quantification remains difficult without primary standards. Three new PUFA&#8208;metabolites, namely 18&#8208;F  3t  &#8208;Isoprostane (IsoP) from eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), 20&#8209;F  4t  &#8209;Neuroprostane (NeuroP) from docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and 20&#8208;F  3t  &#8208;NeuroP from docosapentaenoic acid (DPA  n&#8208;3  ) were synthesized by two complementary synthetic strategies. The first one relied on a racemic approach to 18(  RS  )&#8208;18&#8208;F  3t  &#8208;IsoP using an oxidative radical anion cyclization as a key step, whereas the second used an enzymatic deracemization of a bicyclo[3.3.0]octene intermediate obtained from cyclooctadiene to pursue an asymmetric synthesis. The synthesized metabolites were applied in targeted lipidomics to prove lipid peroxidation in edible oils of commercial nutraceuticals.</dc:description>

      <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Cascade C&#8208;H Activation/Annulation Processes for the Synthesis of Polycycles</title>
      <dc:description>Polycycles are abundantly present in numerous advanced chemicals, functional materials, bioactive molecules and natural products. However, the strategies for the synthesis of polycycles are limited to classical reactions and transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions, requiring prefunctionalized starting materials and lengthy synthetic operations. The emergence of novel approaches shows great promise for the fields of organic/medicinal/material chemistry. Among them, transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H activation followed by intermolecular annulation reactions prevail, due to their straightforward manner with high atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economy, providing rapid, concise and efficient methods for the construction of diverse polycycles. Several strategies have been developed for the synthesis of polycycles, relying on sequential multiple C&#8208;H activation/annulation, or combination of C&#8208;H activation/annulation and further interaction with a proximal group, or merger of C&#8208;H activation with a cycloaddition reaction, or  in situ  formation of the directing group. These are attractive, efficient, step&#8208; and atom&#8208;economic methods starting from commercially available materials. This review will provide an introduction to transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H activation for the synthesis of polycycles, helping researchers to discover indirect connections and reveal hidden opportunities. It will also promote the discovery of novel synthetic strategies relying on C&#8208;H activation.</dc:description>

      <title>Dipolar Nanocars Based on a Porphyrin Backbone</title>
      <dc:description>The design and synthesis of a new family of nanocars is reported. To control their motion, we integrated a dipole which can be tuned thanks to strategic donor and acceptor substituents at the 5&#8208; and 15&#8208;positions of the porphyrin backbone. The two other meso positions are substituted with ethynyltriptycene moieties which are known to act as wheels. Full characterization of nine nanocars is presented as well as the electrochemistry of these push&#8208;pull molecules. DFT calculations allowed us to evaluate the magnitude of the dipoles and to understand the electrochemical behavior and how it is affected by the electron donating and accepting groups present. An X&#8208;ray crystal structure of one nanocar has also been obtained.</dc:description>

Observation of through&#8208;space (or through&#8208;hydrogen bond) relativistic effects between a heavy element (iodine) and a hydrogen atom is reported in this work. The artwork represents a neutron star (an extremely heavy space object) that causes relativistic time effects (a connotation of Einstein's theory of relativity).

      <title>Differential Effects of Nitrogen&#8208;Substitution in 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;Membered Aromatic Motifs</title>
      <dc:description>
The sequential replacement of carbon with nitrogen, which decreases the aromaticity of benzene more than furan, pyrrole, or thiophene is reported in this work, based on experimental and theoretical analysis. Likewise, nitrogen substitution can increase Diels&#8212;Alder reactivity 100&#8197;billion&#8208;fold more in 6&#8208; than in analogous 5&#8208;membered rings. The backdrop of the cover image is Der Mandrill by Franz Marc. This 1913 cubist painting hangs in the Pinakothek der Moderne in Munich and is used in tribute to the late Rolf Huisgen (b. 1920) who died recently, aged 99. More information can be found in the Communication by R.&#8197;T. Raines et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202000825).

In situ  measurements were performed in spectro&#8208;electrochemical cells. Under anhydrous conditions, Eu(III) and Eu(II) were complexed by NTf  2  , forming Eu&#8208;O and Eu&#8208;(N,O) bonds with the anion sulfoxide function and N atoms, respectively.

      <title>Hydride Transfer to Gold: Yes or No? Exploring the Unexpected Versatility of Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;M Bonding in Heterobimetallic Dihydrides</title>
      <dc:description>
AuI and AuIII complexes react with Cp2WH2 forming a diverse range of heterobimetallic adducts, ranging from Au&#8592;W dative adducts to Au&#8592;H&#8722;W sigma complexes and double 3&#8208;centre&#8208;2&#8208;electron bonded structures. Reactions with Cp2ZrH2, instead, lead to fast and quantitative hydride transfer to gold.







Abstract
The potential for coordination and H&#8208;transfer from Cp2MH2 (M=Zr, W) to gold(I) and gold(III) complexes was explored in a combined experimental and computational study. [(L)Au]+ cations react with Cp2WH2 giving [(L)Au(&#954;2&#8208;H2WCp2)]+ (L=IPr (1), cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (2), PPh3 (3) and Dalphos&#8208;Me (4) [IPr=1,3&#8208;bis(diisopropylphenyl)imidazolylidene; Dalphos&#8208;Me=di(1&#8208;adamantyl)&#8208;2&#8208;(dimethylamino)phenyl&#8208;phosphine], while [Au(DMAP)2]+ (DMAP=p&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine) affords the C2&#8208;symmetric [Au(&#954;&#8208;H2WCp2)2]+ (5). The Dalphos complex&#8197;4 can be protonated to give the bicationic adduct 4&#8201;H, showing AuI&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H+&#8722;N hydrogen bonding. The gold(III) Lewis acid [(C^N&#8722;CH)Au(C6F5)(OEt2)]+ binds Cp2WH2 to give an Au&#8208;H&#8208;W &#963;&#8208;complex. By contrast, the pincer species [(C^N^C)Au]+ adds Cp2WH2 by a purely dative W&#8594;Au bond, without Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H interaction. The biphenylyl&#8208;based chelate [(C^C)Au]+ forms [(C^C)Au(&#956;&#8208;H)2WCp2]+, with two 2&#8208;electron&#8208;3&#8208;centre W&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au interactions and practically no Au&#8722;W donor acceptor contribution. In all these complexes, strong but polarized W&#8722;H bonds are maintained, without H&#8208;transfer to gold. On the other hand, the reactions of Cp2ZrH2 with gold complexes led in all cases to rapid H&#8208;transfer and formation of gold hydrides. Relativistic DFT calculations were used to rationalize the striking reactivity and bonding differences in these heterobimetallic hydride complexes along with an analysis of their characteristic NMR parameters and UV/Vis absorption properties.

      <title>Ferroelectric Metal&#8208;Organic Framework as a Host Material for Sulfur to Alleviate the Shuttle Effect of Lithium&#8722;Sulfur Battery</title>
      <dc:description>Ferroelectric has an excellent reversible polarization conversion behavior under external electric field. Herein, we propose an interesting strategy to alleviate the shuttle effect of lithium&#8208;sulfur battery by utilizing ferroelectric metal&#8208;organic framework (FMOF) as a host material for the first time. Compared to other MOF with same structure but without ferroelectricity and commercial carbon black, the cathode based on FMOF exhibits a low capacity decay and high cycling stability. These results demonstrate that the polarization switching behaviors of FMOF under the discharge voltage of lithium&#8208;sulfur battery can effectively trap polysulfides by polar&#8211;polar interactions, decrease polysulfides shuttle and improve the electrochemical performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur battery.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ferroelectric has an excellent reversible polarization conversion behavior under external electric field. Herein, we propose an interesting strategy to alleviate the shuttle effect of lithium&#8208;sulfur battery by utilizing ferroelectric metal&#8208;organic framework (FMOF) as a host material for the first time. Compared to other MOF with same structure but without ferroelectricity and commercial carbon black, the cathode based on FMOF exhibits a low capacity decay and high cycling stability. These results demonstrate that the polarization switching behaviors of FMOF under the discharge voltage of lithium&#8208;sulfur battery can effectively trap polysulfides by polar&#8211;polar interactions, decrease polysulfides shuttle and improve the electrochemical performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur battery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Modulating Hierarchical Micro/Mesoporosity by a Mixed Solvent Approach in Al&#8208;MOF: Stabilization of MAPbBr3 Quantum Dots</title>

Water/ethanol mixture has played a crucial role in the mesopore generation in  MOF1M  25  , MOF1M  50  ,  and  MOF1M  75  , which is achieved by  in situ  formation of water/ethanol clusters. By adjusting the ratio of water&#8208;ethanol, the particle size, surface area and micro/mesopore volume fraction of the MOFs are controlled. Furthermore, reaction time also plays a critical role in mesopore formation as realized by varying reaction time for the MOF with 50% ethanol (  MOF1M  50  ). Additionally, hierarchical MOF (  MOF1M  50  ) has been used as a template for the stabilization of MAPbBr  3  (MA = methylammonium) perovskite quantum dots (PQDs).

      <title>Homo&#8208; and heterodinuclear arene&#8208;linked osmium(II) and ruthenium(II) organometallics: probing the impact of metal variation on reactivity and biological activity</title>
      <dc:description>Dinuclear metallodrugs offer much potential in the development of novel anticancer chemotherapeutics as a result of the distinct interactions possible with biomacromolecular targets and the unique biological activity that can result. Here, we describe the development of isostructural homodinuclear Os(II)&#8208;Os(II) and heterodinuclear Os(II)&#8208;Ru(II) organometallic complexes formed from the linking of the arene ligands of [M(&#951;6&#8208;arene)(C2O4)(PTA)] (M = Os/Ru; PTA = 1,3,5&#8208;triaza&#8208;7&#8208;phosphaadamantane) units. Together with the known Ru(II)&#8208;Ru(II) analogue, a chromatin&#8208;modifying agent, we probed the impact of variation of the metal ions on the structure, reactivity and biological activity of these complexes. The complexes have been structurally characterised by X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments, their stability and reactivity examined using  1H and  31P NMR spectroscopy and biological activity assessed, alongside mononuclear analogues, through MTT assays and cell cycle analysis (HT&#8208;29 cell line). Results revealed high antiproliferative activity in each case with cell cycle profiles of the dinuclear complexes found to be similar to that for untreated cells, and similar but distinct profiles for the mononuclear complexes. These results indicate these complexes impact on cell viability predominantly through a non&#8208;DNA damaging mechanism of action. The new Os(II)&#8208;Os(II and Os(II)&#8208;Ru(II) complexes reported here are further examples of a family of compounds operating via mechanism(s) of action atypical of the majority of metallodrugs, and which have potential as tools in chromatin research.</dc:description>

      <title>Polypyridyl&#8208;Based Copper Phenanthrene Complexes: Combining Stability with Enhanced DNA Recognition</title>
      <dc:description>We report a series of copper(II) artificial metallo&#8208;nucleases (AMNs) and demonstrate their DNA damaging properties and in vitro cytotoxicity against human&#8208;derived pancreatic cancer cells. The compounds combine a tris&#8208;chelating polypyridyl ligand,  di  &#8208;(2&#8208;pycolyl)amine (DPA), and a DNA intercalating phenanthrene unit. Their general formula is Cu&#8208;DPA&#8208;N,N&#180; (where N,N&#180; = 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (Phen), dipyridoquinoxaline (DPQ) or dipyridophenazine (DPPZ)). Characterisation was achieved by X&#8208;ray crystallography and continuous&#8208;wave EPR (cw&#8208;EPR), hyperfine sublevel correlation (HYSCORE) and Davies electron&#8211;nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopies. The presence of the DPA ligand enhances solution stability and facilitates enhanced DNA recognition with apparent binding constants (  K  app  ) rising from 10  5  to 10  7  M  &#8208;1  with increasing extent of planar phenanthrene. Cu&#8208;DPA&#8208;DPPZ, the complex with greatest DNA binding and intercalation effects, recognises the minor groove of guanine&#8208;cytosine (G&#8208;C) rich sequences. Oxidative DNA damage also occurs in the minor groove and can be inhibited by superoxide and hydroxyl radical trapping agents.

      <title>Electron storage capability and singlet oxygen productivity of a Ru(II) photosensitizer containing a fused naphthaloylenebenzene moiety at the 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline ligand</title>
      <dc:description>As a novel rylene type dye a diimine ligand with a fully rigid and extended &#960;&#8208;system in its backbone was prepared by directly fusing a 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline building block with 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide. The corresponding heteroleptic ruthenium photosensitizer bearing one biipo and two tbbpy ligands was synthesized and extensively analyzed by a combination of NMR, single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, steady&#8208;state absorption and emission, time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy and different electrochemical measurements supported by time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations. The cyclic and differential pulse voltammograms revealed, that the naphthaloylene&#8208;benzene moiety enables an additional second reduction of the ligand. Moreover, this ligand possesses a very broad absorption in the visible region. In the Ru(II) complex this causes an overlap of ligand&#8208;centered and metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer transitions. The emission of the complex is clearly redshifted compared to the ligand emission with very long&#8208;lived excited states lifetimes of 1.7 and 24.7 &#181;s in oxygen&#8208;free acetonitrile solution. This behavior is accompanied by a surprisingly high oxygen sensitivity. Finally, this photosensitizer was successfully applied for the effective evolution of singlet oxygen challenging some of the common Ru(II) prototype complexes.</dc:description>

      <title>Probing the origin of adaptive aromaticity in 16&#8208;valence&#8208;electron metallapentalenes</title>
      <dc:description>Species with adaptive aromaticity are aromatic in the ground and lowest&#8208;lying triplet excited states and they have normally intermediate singlet&#8208;triplet gaps. Few examples of compounds with adaptive aromaticity are known to date, including 16&#8208;valence&#8208;electron (16e) metallapentalenes. A sweeping search could be conducted to discover new members of this group, but efficient designs with an explicit strategy would facilitate the quest for new members of this elusive family. Density functional theory calculations and aromaticity evaluations have been performed to reveal the nature of triplet&#8208;state aromaticity in 16e metallapentalenes. Our results show that coordination of strong &#963;&#8208; or &#960;&#8208;donor ligands helps achieving adaptive aromaticity of 16e metallapentalenes by means of a spin delocalization mechanism. These results have important implications for understanding the unusual properties of the organometallic adaptive aromatics, leading the way to efficient design of new compounds with tunable singlet&#8208;triplet gaps.</dc:description>

C&#8722;H activation with cyclopentadienyl complexes: Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization reactions with Cp*MIII catalysts (M=Co, Rh, Ir) have found a wide variety of applications in organic synthesis. Albeit the intrinsic difficulties in achieving catalytic stereocontrol using these catalysts due to their lack of additional coordination sites for external chiral ligands and the conformational flexibility of the Cp ligand, catalytic enantioselective C&#8722;H functionalization reactions using the Group&#8197;9 metal triad with Cp&#8208;type ligands have been intensively studied since 2012. In this Minireview on page&#8197;7346&#8197;ff., T. Yoshino, S. Satake and S. Matsunaga summarize and discuss the progress in these reactions according to the type of the chiral catalyst used. The development of chiral Cpx ligands and their metal complexes, artificial metalloenzymes, chiral carboxylate&#8208;assisted enantioselective C&#8722;H activations, enantioselective alkylations assisted by chiral carboxylic acids or chiral sulfonates, and chiral transient directing groups are discussed.

This process is responsible of the in vitro anti&#8208;virulence activity of the ligand. More information can be found in the Full Paper by C. Gonz&#225;lez&#8208;Bello, et&#8197;al.

      <title>Dibenzothiophenesulfilimines: A Convenient Approach to Intermolecular Rhodium&#8208;Catalysed C&#8722;H Amidation</title>
      <dc:description>
Simple, stable, cheap: N&#8208;Sulfonyl and N&#8208;acyl dibenzothiophene&#8208;based sulfilimines were utilised as transfer reagents in rhodium&#8208;catalysed C&#8722;H amidation reactions. This method allows the efficient and economic monoamidation of substrates bearing different directing groups and differently hybridised C&#8722;H bonds. It can further be expanded to the use of other Group&#8197;9 transition&#8208;metal catalysts (see scheme).







Abstract
A sulfilimine&#8208;based Group&#8197;9 transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalysed C&#8722;H amidation procedure is reported. Dibenzothiophene&#8208;based sulfilimines were shown to constitute a class of novel amidation reagents which enable the transfer of a wide range of N&#8208;sulfonyl and N&#8208;acyl moieties. It was demonstrated that sulfilimines, which are easily accessible from cheap reagents, are safe&#8208;to&#8208;handle and represent broadly applicable amidation reagents. The dibenzothiophene can be recycled after use. The C&#8722;H amidation was shown to proceed with high selectivity and gave the mono&#8208;amidated products, mostly in good to excellent yields.

      <dc:description>In the continuous search to develop multimodal systems with combined diagnostic and therapeutic functions, several efforts have been focused on the development of multifunctional drug delivery systems. Herein we designed, by a covalent approach, a novel class of fluorinated poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) co&#8208;polymers (F&#8208;PLGA) containing an increasing number of magnetically equivalent fluorine atoms. In particular, two novel compounds, F  3  &#8208;PLGA and F  9  &#8208;PLGA, were synthesized and their chemical structure and thermal stability were analysed by solution NMR, DSC, and TGA. The obtained F&#8208;PLGA compounds were proved to form in aqueous solution colloidal stable nanoparticles (NPs) displaying a strong  19  F&#8208;NMR signal. The fluorinated NPs also showed an enhanced ability to load hydrophobic drugs containing fluorine atoms with respect to analogue pristine PLGA NPs. Preliminary  in vitro  studies showed their cellular availability and ability to intracellularly deliver and release a functioning drug.</dc:description>

      <title>Degeneracy of the antithrombin binding sequence in heparin: 2&#8208;O&#8208;sulfated Iduronic acid can replace the critical glucuronic acid.</title>
      <dc:description>Heparin binds to and activates antithrombin (AT) through a specific pentasaccharide sequence in which a trisaccharide subsite, containing glucuronic acid (GlcA), has been considered as the initiator in the recognition of the polysaccharide by the protein. More recently it was suggested that sulfated iduronic acid (IdoA2S) could replace this &#8220;canonical&#8221; GlcA. Indeed, a heparin octasaccharidic sequence obtained by chemoenzymatic synthesis, in which GlcA is replaced by IdoA2S has been found to similarly bind to and activate antithrombin. Using Saturation&#8208;Transfer&#8208;Difference NMR, NOEs, transfer NMR and Molecular Dynamics, we show that upon binding to AT this IdoA2S unit develops comparable interactions with AT as GlcA. Interestingly, two IdoA2S units, both present in a 1C4 &#8208; 2S0 equilibrium in the unbound saccharide, respectively shift to full 2S0 and full 1C4 upon binding to antithrombin, providing the best illustration of the critical role of iduronic acid conformational flexibility in biological systems.</dc:description>

This Concept takes into account recent studies to make the case that gases can indeed be efficiently and safely formed from relatively inexpensive commercially available reagents for use in a wide range of organic transformations. In particular, we argue that the exploitation of continuous flow membrane reactors enables the effective separation of the chemistry necessary for gas formation from the chemistry for gas consumption, with these two stages often containing incompatible chemistry.

      <title>Hydrolysis of Peptide Bonds in Protein Micelles promoted by Zr(IV)&#8208;Substituted Polyoxometalate as an Artificial Protease</title>
      <dc:description>The hydrolysis of hydrophobic or unstructured proteins is challanging due to their poor solubility which often requires presence of surfactants.

      <title>One Way Traffic: Base&#8208;to&#8208;Backbone Hole Transfer in Nucleoside Phosphorodithioate</title>
      <dc:description>
Tracking holes: The nature and directionality of the hole&#8208;transfer pathways in phosphorodithioate systems and identification of the radicals involved was achieved by employing a unique combination of synthesis, ESR spectroscopic studies in frozen aqueous solution at low temperature, pulse radiolysis in aqueous solution at room temperature, and ab initio DFT calculations.







Abstract
The directionality of the hole&#8208;transfer processes between DNA backbone and base was investigated by using phosphorodithioate [P(S&#8722;)=S] components. ESR spectroscopy in homogeneous frozen aqueous solutions and pulse radiolysis in aqueous solution at ambient temperature confirmed initial formation of G.+&#8208;P(S&#8722;)=S. The ionization potential of G&#8208;P(S&#8722;)=S was calculated to be slightly lower than that of guanine in 5&#8242;&#8208;dGMP. Subsequent thermally activated hole transfer from G.+ to P(S&#8722;)=S led to dithiyl radical (P&#8208;2S.) formation on the &#956;s timescale. In parallel, ESR spectroscopy, pulse radiolysis, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed P&#8208;2S. formation in an abasic phosphorodithioate model compound. ESR investigations at low temperatures and higher G&#8208;P(S&#8722;)=S concentrations showed a bimolecular conversion of P&#8208;2S. to the &#963;2&#8208;&#963;*1&#8208;bonded dimer anion radical [&#8208;P&#8208;2S

2S&#8208;P&#8208;]&#8722; formation was not observed by pulse radiolysis [&#916;G&#176; (298&#8197;K, DFT)=&#8722;1.4&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1]. Neither P&#8208;2S. nor [&#8208;P&#8208;2S

      <title>Ionic Dissociation of SiCl4: Formation of [SiL6]Cl4 with L=Dimethylphosphinic Acid</title>
      <dc:description>
Ionic dissociation of SiCl4: The first example of a structurally characterized tetra&#8208;cationic hexacoordinated silicon tetrachloride is reported. It was obtained by reaction of dimethylphosphinic acid with SiCl4 under ambient conditions. Additionally, the structure of a cyclic dimeric hexacoordinated silicon complex was determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and verified by solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy.







Abstract
Reactions of SiCl4 with R2PO(OH) (R=Me, Cl) yield compounds with six&#8208;fold coordinated silicon atoms. Whereas R=Me afforded the hexacoordinated tetra&#8208;cationic silicon complex [Si(Me2PO(OH))6]4+ with chloride counter&#8208;ions, R=Cl caused release of HCl with formation of a cyclic dimeric silicon complex [Si(Cl2PO(OH))(Cl2PO2)3(&#956;&#8208;Cl2PO2)]2 with bridging bidentate dichlorophosphates.

      <title>DNA Nucleobase Under Ionizing Radiation: Unexpected Proton Transfer by Thymine Cation in Water Nanodroplets</title>
      <dc:description>The effects of ionizing radiation on DNA constituents is a widely studied fundamental process using experimental and computational techniques. In particular radiation effects on nucleobases are usually tackled by mass spectrometry in which the nucleobase is embedded in a water nanodroplet. Here we present a multiscale theoretical study revealing the effects and the dynamics of water droplets towards neutral and ionized thymine. In particular, by using both hybrid quantum mechanics molecular mechanics and fully ab initio molecular dynamics we reveal an unexpected proton transfer from thymine cation to a nearby water molecule. This leads to the formation of a neutral radical thymine and a Zundel structure, while the hydrated proton localizes at the interface between the deprotonated thymine and the water droplet. This observation opens entirely novel perspective concerning the reactivity and further fragmentation of ionized nucleobases.</dc:description>

      <title>Scalable Hybrid Synthetic/Biocatalytic Route to Psilocybin</title>
      <dc:description>
The benefits of bulk: Future use of psilocybin as a medication will entail increased demand. We present a gram&#8208;scale synthetic/biocatalytic approach in which the mushroom kinase PsiK replaces tedious chemical phosphorylation. A pilot&#8208;scale protocol to make three&#8208;digit milligram amounts of pure and active recombinant PsiK available is also described.







Abstract
Psilocybin, the principal indole alkaloid of Psilocybe mushrooms, is currently undergoing clinical trials as a medication against treatment&#8208;resistant depression and major depressive disorder. The psilocybin supply for pharmaceutical purposes is met by synthetic chemistry. We replaced the problematic phosphorylation step during synthesis with the mushroom kinase PsiK. This enzyme was biochemically characterized and used to produce one gram of psilocybin from psilocin within 20 minutes. We also describe a pilot&#8208;scale protocol for recombinant PsiK that yielded 150&#8197;mg enzyme in active and soluble form. Our work consolidates the simplicity of tryptamine chemistry with the specificity and selectivity of enzymatic catalysis and helps provide access to an important drug at potentially reasonable cost.

      <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalyst&#8208; and Additive&#8208;Free Cross&#8208;Coupling of &#946;&#8208;Ketothioamides with &#945;&#8208;Diazo 1,3&#8208;Diketones: Access to Highly Functionalized Thiazolines</title>
      <dc:description>
Visibly simple: Low&#8208;energy visible&#8208;light from a blue LED induced operationally simple and efficient coupling of &#946;&#8208;ketothioamides with &#945;&#8208;diazo 1,3&#8208;diketones occurs under photocatalyst&#8208; and additive&#8208;free conditions. The chemoselective S&#8208;alkylation followed by intramolecular N&#8208;cyclization of &#946;&#8208;ketothioamides with electrophilic carbenes generated in situ enabled the formation of densely functionalized thiazolines in excellent yields.







Abstract
A photocatalyst&#8208; and additive&#8208;free, visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated chemoselective domino protocol was devised to access fully substituted thiazoline derivatives from &#946;&#8208;ketothioamides and &#945;&#8208;diazo 1,3&#8208;diketones at moderate temperature in open air. The reaction proceeds through in situ generation of electrophilic carbenes from &#945;&#8208;diazo 1,3&#8208;diketones by a low&#8208;energy blue LED (448&#8197;nm), which undergoes selective coupling with nucleophilic &#946;&#8208;ketothioamides to give thiazolines by successive formation of C&#8722;S and C&#8722;N bonds in one stretch. Notably, the benign and clean conditions, operational simplicity, sustainability, 100&#8201;% carbon economy, high yields, and wide functional&#8208;group tolerance are further attributes of the strategy. A mechanistic rationale for this cascade reaction sequence is well supported by control experiments.

Abstract
Free base, zinc and palladium &#960;&#8208;extended porphyrins containing fused naphthalenediamide units were employed as photosensitizers in antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT). Their efficacy, assessed by photophysical and in vitro photobiological studies on Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, was found to depend on metal coordination, showing a dramatic enhancement of photosensitizing activity for the palladium complex.

      <dc:description>Herein we describe the design, synthesis and characterization of a phenhomazine ligand with six pendant acetate arms designed for the combined coordination of copper(II) and lanthanide(III) ions, with the perspective of the development of a &#8220;turn&#8211;off&#8221; copper sensor. The key step for the ligand preparation was the one&#8211;step endomethylene bridge fission of a diamino Tr&#246;ger&#8217;s base with a concomitant alkylation. Fluorescence and absorption spectroscopies as well as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments were performed in order to analyze and understand the coordination properties of the ligand. Transition metal coordination was driven by the synergistic effect of the free nitrogen atoms of the diazocinic core and the two central acetate arms attached to those nitrogens, whereas lanthanide coordination is performed by external acetate arms, presumably forming a self&#8211;assembled 2:2 metallosupramolecular structure. The terbium complex shows the typical green emission with narrow bands and long luminescence lifetimes. The luminescence quenching produced by the presence of copper(II) ions was analyzed.

      <title>An NMR&#8208;based biosensor to measure stereo&#8208;specific methionine sulfoxide reductase (MSR) activities in vitro and in vivo.</title>
      <dc:description>Oxidation of protein methionines to methionine&#8208;sulfoxides (MetOx) is associated with several age&#8208;related diseases. In healthy cells, MetOx is reduced to methionine by two families of conserved methionine sulfoxide reductase enzymes, MSRA and MSRB that specifically target the  S  &#8208; or  R  &#8208;diastereoisomers of methionine&#8208;sulfoxides, respectively. To directly interrogate MSRA and MSRB functions in cellular settings, we developed an NMR&#8208;based biosensor that we call CarMetOx to simultaneously measure both enzyme activities in single reaction setups. We demonstrate the suitability of our strategy to delineate MSR functions in complex biological environments, including cell lysates and live zebrafish embryos. Thereby, we establish differences in substrate specificities between prokaryotic and eukaryotic MSRs and introduce CarMetOx as a highly sensitive tool for studying therapeutic targets of oxidative stress&#8208;related human diseases and redox regulated signaling pathways.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Oxidation of protein methionines to methionine&#8208;sulfoxides (MetOx) is associated with several age&#8208;related diseases. In healthy cells, MetOx is reduced to methionine by two families of conserved methionine sulfoxide reductase enzymes, MSRA and MSRB that specifically target the  S  &#8208; or  R  &#8208;diastereoisomers of methionine&#8208;sulfoxides, respectively. To directly interrogate MSRA and MSRB functions in cellular settings, we developed an NMR&#8208;based biosensor that we call CarMetOx to simultaneously measure both enzyme activities in single reaction setups. We demonstrate the suitability of our strategy to delineate MSR functions in complex biological environments, including cell lysates and live zebrafish embryos. Thereby, we establish differences in substrate specificities between prokaryotic and eukaryotic MSRs and introduce CarMetOx as a highly sensitive tool for studying therapeutic targets of oxidative stress&#8208;related human diseases and redox regulated signaling pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Ultrabright terbium nanoparticles for FRET biosensing and in&#8208;situ imaging of epidermal growth factor receptors</title>
      <dc:description>Lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles (LnNPs) have become an important class of fluorophores for advanced biosensing and bioimaging. LnNPs that are photosensitized by surface&#8208;attached antenna ligands can possess exceptional brightness. However, their functional bioconjugation remains an important challenge for their translation into bioanalytical applications. To solve this problem, we designed a ligand that can be simultaneously applied as efficient light harvesting antenna for Tb surface ions and strong linker of biomolecules to the LnNPs surfaces. To demonstrate generic applicability of the photosensitized TbNP&#8208;bioconjugates, we applied them in two prototypical applications for biosensing and bioimaging. First, in&#8208;solution biorecognition was shown by time&#8208;resolved F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between streptavidin&#8208;functionalized TbNPs to biotinylated dyes (ATTO 610). Second, in&#8208;situ detection of ligand&#8208;receptor binding on cells was accomplished with TbNP&#8208;antibody (Matuzumab) conjugates that could specifically bind to transmembrane epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR). High specificity and sensitivity were demonstrated by time&#8208;gated imaging of EGFR on both strongly (A431) and weakly (HeLa and Cos7) EGFR&#8208;expressing cell lines, whereas non&#8208;expressing cell lines (NIH3T3) and EGFR&#8208;passivated A431 cells did not show any signals. Despite the relatively large size of TbNP&#8208;antibody conjugates, they could be internalized by A431 cells upon binding to extracellular EGFR, which showed their potential as bright and stable luminescence markers for intracellular signalling.</dc:description>

      <title>Reactions in Water Involving the &#8220;On&#8208;Water&#8221; Mechanism</title>
      <dc:description>
Like oil and water: Ever&#8208;evolving advances in water&#8208;compatible catalysts have enriched the current understanding of sustainable organic chemistry, nevertheless, the lack of a clearly defined classification system has led to confusion. In addition to the definition of words and proposed model of &#8220;on&#8208;water&#8221; mechanism, recent examples of reactions accelerated in water are herein discussed.







Abstract
Ever&#8208;evolving catalyst advances in synthetic protocols using water as a reaction medium have enriched the understanding of sustainable organic chemistry. Because conventional classification and definitions were ambivalent, it is proposed here that catalytic reactions using water be collectively called to be &#8220;in water&#8221;, with further classification into seven types. When accelerated in water as heterogeneous mixtures, the reactions can be regarded as following an &#8220;on&#8208;water&#8221; mechanism. The original term &#8220;on water&#8221; coined by Sharpless is incongruous with catalytic reactions, whereas on&#8208;water used in this review covers all the interfaces involving water where chemical reactions are accelerated. As a result of the unconcluded dispute on the antiquated catalyst&#8208;free &#8220;on water&#8221; model, the modified model defines three water layers: water molecules that are oriented to extrude protons toward the oil phase in the inner layer, those enwrapped by a secondary layer, and finally the bulk water layer. In light of the latitudinous outlook on the role of water at the interface, selected examples of reactions, in particular those reported over the past decade, that follow an &#8220;on&#8208;water&#8221; mechanism are reviewed herein.

      <title>The Macrocycle versus Chain Competition in On&#8208;Surface Polymerization: Insights from Reactions of 1,3&#8208;Dibromoazulene on Cu(111)</title>
      <dc:description>
The competition between macrocycle and chain formation in organometallic on&#8208;surface polymerization can be steered by variation of coverage and temperature. The entropically favored chains are preferentially formed under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions and high coverage, whereas the more stable macrocycles prevail when the on&#8208;surface synthesis is performed in equilibrium at low coverages.







Abstract
Ring/chain competition in oligomerization reactions represents a long&#8208;standing topic of synthetic chemistry and was treated extensively for solution reactions but is not well&#8208;understood for the two&#8208;dimensional confinement of surface reactions. Here, the kinetic and thermodynamic principles of ring/chain competition in on&#8208;surface synthesis are addressed by scanning tunneling microscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Monte Carlo simulations applied to azulene&#8208;based organometallic oligomers on Cu(111). Analysis of experiments and simulations reveals how the ring/chain ratio can be controlled through variation of coverage and temperature. At room temperature, non&#8208;equilibrium conditions prevail and kinetic control leads to preferential formation of the entropically favored chains. In contrast, high&#8208;temperature equilibrium conditions are associated with thermodynamic control, resulting in increased yields of the energetically favored rings. The optimum conditions for ring formation include the lowest possible temperature within the regime of thermodynamic control and a low coverage. The general implications are discussed and compared to the solution case.

      <title>Photoinduced Pyramidal Inversion Behavior of Phosphanes Involved with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Behavior</title>
      <dc:description>
&#8220;One day, we found a report that triphenylphosphane shows AIE behavior. Therefore, we wondered what structural changes to phosphanes take place in the excited state.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;&#9642;squf;&#8197;ff.

Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue is Kenta Kokado and co&#8208;workers at Hokkaido University. The cover picture describes the interesting pyramidal inversion behavior of phosphanes in the excited state, like entering &#8220;the Mirror World&#8221;, which we found in this research. Read the full text of the article at 10.1002/chem.202000264.
