         <title>Rational Design and Biological Application of Hybrid Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorophores are considered powerful tools for not only enabling the visualization of cell structures, substructures, and biological processes, but also making for the quantitative and qualitative measurement of various analytes in living systems. However, most fluorophores do not meet the diverse requirements for biological applications in terms of their photophysical and biological properties. Hybridization is an important strategy in molecular engineering that provides fluorophores with complementarity and multifunctionality. This review summarizes the basic strategies of hybridization with four classes of fluorophores, including xanthene, cyanine, coumarin, and BODIPY with a focus on their structure&#8208;property relationship (SPR) and biological applications. This review aims to provide rational hybrid ideas for expanding the reservoir of knowledge regarding fluorophores and promoting the development of newly produced fluorophores for applications in the field of life sciences.</dc:description>

         <title>Aromaticity in the Electronic Ground and Lowest Triplet States of Molecules with Fused Thiophene Rings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Analysis of the variations of the off&#8208;nucleus isotropic magnetic shielding, &#963;iso(r), around thiophene, thienothiophenes, dithienothiophenes&#160;and sulflowers in their electronic ground (S0) and lowest triplet (T1) states reveals that some of the features of aromaticity and bonding in these molecules do not fit in with predictions based on the popular H&#252;ckel&#8217;s and Baird&#8217;s rules. Despite having 4n &#960; electrons, the S0 states of the sulflowers are shown to be aromatic, due to the local aromaticities of the thiophene rings. To reduce T1 antiaromaticity, the geometry of thiophene changes between S0 and T1: In addition to losing planarity, the carbon&#8208;carbon two &#8216;double&#8217; and one &#8216;single&#8217; bonds in S0 turn into two &#8216;single&#8217; and one &#8216;double&#8217; bonds in T1. Well&#8208;defined Baird&#8208;style aromaticity reversals are observed between the S0 and T1 states of only three of the twelve thiophene&#8208;based compounds investigated in this work; in contrast, the sulflower with six thiophene rings which is weakly aromatic in S0 becomes more aromatic in T1. The results suggest that the change in aromaticity between the S0 and T1 states in chains of fused rings is likely to affect mostly the central ring(s); rings sufficiently far away from the central ring(s) can retain aromatic character.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA&#8208;Targeted Complexes of Tc and Re for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to their favorable chemical features, Re and Tc complexes have been widely used for the development of new therapeutic agents and imaging probes to solve problems of biomedical relevance. This review provides an update of the most relevant research efforts towards the development of novel cancer theranostic agents using Re and Tc&#8208;based compounds interacting with specific DNA structures. This includes a variety of homometallic complexes, namely those containing M(CO)3 (M = Re, Tc) moieties, that exhibit different modes of interaction with DNA, such as covalent binding, intercalation, groove binding or G&#8208;quadruplex DNA binding. Additionally, heterometallic complexes, designed to potentiate synergistic effects of different metal centers to improve DNA&#8208;targeting, cytotoxicity and fluorescence properties, are also reviewed. Particular attention is also given to 99mTc&#8208; and 188Re&#8208;labeled oligonucleotides that have been widely explored to develop imaging and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals through the in vivo hybridization with a specific complementary DNA or RNA target sequence to provide useful molecular tools in precision medicine for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Finally, the need for further improvement of DNA&#8208;targeted Re and Tc&#8208;based compounds as potential therapeutic and diagnostic agents is highlighted, and future directions are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Tripodal Triazine and 1,8&#8208;Naphthalimide based Small Molecules as Efficient Photocatalysts for Visible&#8208;light Oxidative Condensation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tripodal donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) small molecules&#160;Tr&#8208;Np3&#160;and&#160;Tr&#8208;T&#8208;Np3&#160;consisting of triazine and 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide, without and with a thiophene spacer have been synthesized. Their optical and redox properties were thoroughly investigated along with their utilization as photocatalysts in organic transformations. Compounds&#160;Tr&#8208;Np3&#160;and&#160;Tr&#8208;T&#8208;Np3&#160;showed broad absorption in the range of 290&#8208;480 nm in solutions and 300&#8208;510 nm in thin films. These tripodal molecules displayed wide optical bandgaps of (Egopt) 3.10 eV and 2.64 eV with very deep&#8208;lying HOMO energy levels (&#8722;6.60 eV and &#8211;6.03 eV) and low&#8208;lying LUMO levels (&#8722;3.50 eV and &#8722;3.40 eV). Appreciable electron mobilities of 5.24 &#215; 10&#8208;4&#160;cm2/Vs&#160;and 6.14 &#215; 10&#8208;4&#160;cm2/Vs were obtained for compounds&#160;Tr&#8208;Np3&#160;and&#160;Tr&#8208;T&#8208;Np3&#160;respectively by space&#8208;charge limited current (SCLC) measurements. Metal&#8208;free tripodal molecules&#160;Tr&#8208;Np3&#160;and&#160;Tr&#8208;T&#8208;Np3&#160;showed excellent photocatalytic abilities towards condensation of aromatic aldehydes and&#160;o&#8208;phenylenediamine followed by cyclization under visible light to yield benzimidazole derivatives that are of high medicinal value.</dc:description>

         <title>Assembling Molecular Clips To Build &#960;&#8208;Stacks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 67, December 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stacked aromatic rings are important functional motifs in biological systems but are difficult to replicate artificially. To overcome the limitations of weak, non&#8208;directional, and context&#8208;sensitive van der Waals forces, chemists have devised shape&#8208;complementary molecular clips that assemble into vertical stacks with precise spacing, orientation, and sequence of the layers.







Abstract
Nature utilizes an intimate stacking of aromatic motifs to construct functional structures, as demonstrated in protein folding and polynucleotide assembly. However, organized &#960;&#8208;stacks of artificial molecules are difficult to build, primarily due to the weak, non&#8208;directional, and context&#8208;sensitive nature of van der Waals forces. To overcome these challenges, chemists have invented ingenious architectural designs to construct &#960;&#8208;stacked supramolecular assemblies using clip&#8208;like molecules. This Concept article focuses on molecular clips that enable precise spatial control over assembly patterns, beyond the scope of simple host&#8211;guest chemistry. Different design strategies are analyzed and compared that leverage non&#8208;covalent interactions to create multi&#8208;layer &#960;&#8208;stacks. Particular emphasis is placed on the choice of spine units as they play a crucial role in controlling the (i) spacing, (ii) orientation, and (iii) conformational pre&#8208;organization of linked aromatics to achieve long&#8208;range spatial ordering.

         <title>Graphene Oxide Nanosheets Hamper Glutamate Mediated Excitotoxicity and Protect Neuronal Survival In An In vitro Stroke Model</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 67, December 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In vitro models of ischemic stroke based on the cell damage of dissociated central nervous system cultures due to glucose and oxygen deprivation (OGD) or to the exposure to a high concentration of glutamate (Glut) were used to establish that s&#8208;GO, applied during the glutamate mediated excitotoxic cascade, by modulating synaptic over&#8208;activity, exerts a protective effect, thus promoting neuronal survival and integrity.







Abstract
Small graphene oxide (s&#8208;GO) nanosheets reversibly downregulate central nervous system (CNS) excitatory synapses, with potential developments as future therapeutic tools to treat neuro&#8208;disorders characterized by altered glutamatergic transmission. Excitotoxicity, namely cell death triggered by exceeding ambient glutamate fueling over&#8208;activation of excitatory synapses, is a pathogenic mechanism shared by several neural diseases, from ischemic stroke to neurodegenerative disorders. In this work, CNS cultures were exposed to oxygen&#8208;glucose deprivation (OGD) to mimic ischemic stroke in&#8197;vitro, and it is show that the delivery of s&#8208;GO following OGD, during the endogenous build&#8208;up of secondary damage and excitotoxicity, improved neuronal survival. In a different paradigm, excitotoxicity cell damage was reproduced through exogenous glutamate application, and s&#8208;GO co&#8208;treatment protected neuronal integrity, potentially by directly downregulating the synaptic over&#8208;activation brought about by exogenous glutamate. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study suggests that s&#8208;GO may find novel applications in therapeutic developments for treating excitotoxicity&#8208;driven neural cell death.

         <title>Tailoring Secondary Coordination Sphere Effects in Single&#8208;metal&#8208;site Catalysts by Surface Immobilization of Supramolecular Cages</title>

Cage control: Surface immobilization of supramolecular cages gives control over the first&#8208; and second coordination spheres of heterogeneous catalysts, enabling diffusion&#8208;controlled reaction kinetics.







Abstract
Controlling the coordination sphere of heterogeneous single&#8208;metal&#8208;site catalysts is a powerful strategy for fine&#8208;tuning their catalytic properties but is fairly difficult to achieve. To address this problem, we immobilized supramolecular cages where the primary&#8208; and secondary coordination sphere are controlled by ligand design. The kinetics of these catalysts were studied in a model reaction, the hydrolysis of ammonia borane, over a temperature range using fast and precise online measurements generating high&#8208;precision Arrhenius plots. The results show how catalytic properties can be enhanced by placing a well&#8208;defined reaction pocket around the active site. Our fine&#8208;tuning yielded a catalyst with such performance that the reaction kinetics are diffusion&#8208;controlled rather than chemically controlled.

         <title>The Calculation of Both Electrostatic and Van der Waals Effects to Probe the Efficiency of Solvent Extraction of Heterocyclic Aromatics from Heavy Oil</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 67, December 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To resolve the contradiction between denitrification efficiency and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) loss due to complex interactions, a combined model is proposed to evaluate the extraction performance in experiments. It is essential for the preparation of low nitrogen feedstock for a wide range of carbon materials.







Abstract
Due to the complex composition and similar structure, the extraction denitrification of aromatic rich oil is faced with the contradiction problem of denitrification efficiency and aromatic loss which cannot be efficiently solved by experiments. However, the complex interactions involved can be analyzed from the perspective of calculation, and the prediction criteria and methods are proposed. Based on rigorous density functional theory calculation data, Simple models based on electrostatic potential (ESP) and Van der Waals potential (VdWP)&#8208;based calculations were established and validated. The twofold model provided the best prediction for interactions between extractants and nitrogen compounds and between extractants and aromatics, which determines denitrification efficiency and aromatic loss, respectively, due to the most complete description of both electrostatic and VdW force. This provides a powerful tool for evaluating the non&#8208;covalent interactions and thence tuning the efficiency of the separation process. Thus, high denitrification efficiency (43.2~66.3&#8201;%) and moderate aromatic loss (1.7~4.4&#8201;%) were obtained using screened deep eutectic solvents (DESs). This ideal observation provided the potential for mild hydrodesulfurization and manufacture of high&#8208;grade carbon materials.

         <title>Bis(N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene) Manganese(I) Complexes in Catalytic N&#8208;Formylation/N&#8208;Methylation of Amines Using Carbon Dioxide and Phenylsilane</title>

Mn(I) complexes of the type [MnBr(bisNHC)(CO)3], bearing a bidentate bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) ligand (bisNHC), have been synthesized by transmetalation of the bisNHC from the corresponding silver(I) complexes, and fully characterized in solution and in the solid state. The catalytic performances of the complexes have been evaluated in the reductive formylation and methylation of anilines with CO2.







Abstract
A series of six Mn(I) complexes with general formula [MnBr(bisNHC)(CO)3], having a bidentate bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) ligand (bisNHC), has been developed by varying the bridging group between the NHC donors, the nitrogen wingtip substituents and the heterocyclic ring. The synthesis of the complexes has been accomplished by in&#8197;situ transmetalation of the bisNHC from the corresponding silver(I) complexes. Removal of the bromide anion affords the corresponding solvento complexes [Mn(bisNHC)(CO)3(CH3CN)](BF4). The influence of the bisNHC structure on its electron donor ability has been evaluated by FTIR and 13C NMR spectroscopy, both in the neutral and cationic complexes. Finally, the isolated Mn(I)&#8208;bisNHC complexes have been employed as homogeneous catalysts in the reductive N&#8208;formylation and N&#8208;methylation of amines with CO2 as C1 source and phenylsilane as reducing agent, showing a high selectivity for the N&#8208;methylated product. Preliminary mechanistic investigations suggest that, in the adopted reaction conditions, the formylated product can be formed via different reaction pathways, either metal&#8208;catalyzed or not, while the methylation reaction requires the use of the Mn(I) catalyst.

         <title>Quantitative Assessment of Crystallinity and Stability in &#946;&#8208;Ketoenamine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 67, December 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel quantitative method has been established to quantitatively assess the stability of COFs by utilizing two crystallinity&#8208;dependent parameters, I4.6rel and A4.6rel, from the analysis of PXRD profiles. By employing this method, the stabilities of KEA&#8208;COFs have been thoroughly investigated, offering valuable information that goes beyond qualitative descriptions.







Abstract
The design and synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high chemical stability pose significant challenges for practical applications. Although a growing number of robust COFs have been developed and employed for a broad scope of applications, the assessment of COF stability has primarily relied on qualitative descriptions, lacking a rational and quantitative assessment. Herein, a novel assessment method is presented that enables visual and quantitative depiction of COF stability. By analyzing the PXRD patterns of chemically stable &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;based COFs (KEA&#8208;COFs), two crystallinity&#8208;dependent parameters are identified, the relative intensity (I2&#952;rel) and the relative area (A2&#952;rel) of the main peak (2&#952;), which are expected to establish a standardized criterion for assessing COF crystallinity. Based on these parameters, the crystalline changes after stability tests can be visually presented, which provides a rational and quantitative assessment of their stability. This study not only demonstrates the remarkable chemical stability of KEA&#8208;COFs, but also provides valuable insights into the quantitative evaluation of COFs&#8217; crystallinity and stability.

This study not only demonstrates the remarkable chemical stability of KEA-COFs, but also provides valuable insights into the quantitative evaluation of COFs&#8217; crystallinity and stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Tunable 1,2&#8208;Difunctionalization of Terminal Alkynes: Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Ketones</title>

A new method efficiently adds C&#8722;C and C&#8722;S bonds to terminal alkynes, allowing for accessing a range of &#946;&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. The versatility of the approach lies in its ability to tune the reaction conditions to target different positions of the alkyne by switching temperature.







Abstract
A metal&#8208;free tunable 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of the terminal alkynes showcasing a tandem installation of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;S bonds has been developed. The key enabling factor for the approach is the use of acetic acid as an acyl source to synthesize &#946;&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. The reaction at room temperature leads to the regioselective acylation at the terminal carbon of alkynes, whereas at &#8722;78&#8201;&#176;C, the acylation occurs at the more substituted carbon.

         <title>Synthesis and Additive Manufacturing of Hydrazone&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Framework Aerogels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 67, December 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fast gelation and crystallization of hydrazone linked COFs enable processing into hierarchically porous aerogels with tunable solvent adsorption properties. Additionally, the fast reaction kinetics facilitate a reactive 3D printing technique with a sacrificial polymer binder to produce 3D printed structures of COF aerogel material.







Abstract
Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) are crystalline, porous organic materials. Recent studies have demonstrated novel processing strategies for COFs to form adaptable architectures, but these have focused primarily on imine&#8208;linked COFs. This work presents a new synthesis and processing route to produce crystalline hydrazone&#8208;linked COF gels and aerogels with hierarchical porosity. The method was implemented to produce a series of hydrazone&#8208;linked COFs with different alkyl side&#8208;chain substituents, achieving control of the hydrophilicity of the final aerogel. Variation in the length of the alkyl substituents yielded materials with controllable form factors that can preferentially adsorb water or nonpolar organic solvents. Additionally, a method for additive manufacturing of hydrazone&#8208;linked COFs using hydroxymethylcellulose as a sacrificial additive is presented. This work demonstrates an effective and simple approach to the fabrication of hydrazone COF aerogels and additive manufacturing to produce hydrazone COFs of desired shape.

         <title>Localized Crystallization of Calcium Phosphates by Light&#8208;Induced Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 67, December 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
4&#8208;Nitrophenylphosphate and calcium chloride were included inside an aqueous gel matrix for light&#8208;induced precipitation processes and the resulting calcium phosphate precisely reproduces the irradiated areas. These findings can contribute to more sophisticated reaction control in localized crystallization processes of calcium phosphate containing biomaterials. Scale bar 1&#8197;mm.







Abstract
Medical treatment options for bones and teeth can be significantly enhanced by taking control over the crystallization of biomaterials like hydroxyapatite in the healing process. Light&#8208;induced techniques are particularly interesting for this approach as they offer tremendous accuracy in spatial resolution. However, in the field of calcium phosphates, light&#8208;induced crystallization has not been investigated so far. Here, proof of principle is established to successfully induce carbonate&#8208;hydroxyapatite precipitation by light irradiation. Phosphoric acid is released by a photolabile molecule exclusively after irradiation, combining with calcium ions to form a calcium phosphate in the crystallization medium. 4&#8208;Nitrophenylphosphate (4NPP) is established as the photolabile molecule and the system is optimized and fully characterized. A calcium phosphate is crystallized exclusively by irradiation in aqueous solution and identified as carbonate apatite. Control over the localization and stabilization of the carbonate apatite is achieved by a pulsed laser, triggering precipitation in calcium and 4NPP&#8208;containing gel matrices. The results of this communication open up a wide range of new opportunities, both in the field of chemistry for more sophisticated reaction control in localized crystallization processes and in the field of medicine for enhanced treatment of calcium phosphate containing biomaterials.

         <title>Photocatalytic Hydrodecarboxylation of Fatty Acids for Drop&#8208;in Biofuels Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 67, December 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Renewable hydrocarbons were obtained through photocatalytic hydrodecarboxylation of fatty acids using a simple and robust method. This process, which employs the synergistic catalysis of acridine and thiophenol under visible light, enabled the production of a C9&#8722;C17 hydrocarbon blend compatible with biojet fuel from a mixture of fatty acids obtained through the hydrolysis of a vegetable oil.







Abstract
A mild, practical, and environmentally friendly method for the hydrodecarboxylation of fatty acids using an acridine&#8208;based photoredox catalyst and thiophenol was developed. Cn&#8208;1 alkanes were synthesized in good to excellent yields (up to 99&#8201;%) from C10&#8722;C18 saturated fatty acids under visible light irradiation (405&#8197;nm). The developed protocol was employed for a mixture of fatty acids obtained from the hydrolysis of Licuri oil, affording a mixture of C9&#8722;C17 hydrocarbons in quantitative yield, which demonstrates the potential application of the method to produce drop&#8208;in biofuels.

         <title>Oxidative Addition and &#946;&#8208;Hydride Elimination by a Macrocyclic Dinickel Complex: Observing Bimetallic Elementary Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 67, December 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel bimetallic elementary reactions: The oxidative addition of some simple electrophiles to a highly planar dinickel complex with a macrocyclic ligand, NiI2(tBuPONNOPONNO), are described. These reactions form dinickel alkyl complexes of the type NiII2(&#956;&#8208;R). The process of &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination from dinickel ethyl complexes NiII2(&#956;&#8208;Et) was then investigated experimentally and computationally and found to proceed by a novel bimetallic mechanism.







Abstract
The dinickel(I) complex Ni2(tBuPONNOPONNO), featuring a planar macrocyclic diphosphoranide ligand tBuPONNOPONNO, offers a unique architectural platform for observing bimetallic elementary reactions. Oxidative addition reactions of alkyl halides produce dinickel(II) complexes of the type Ni2(&#956;&#8208;R)(&#956;&#8208;X)(tBuPONNOPONNO). However, when R=Et &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination is observed to form a dinickel monohydride, with the rate dependent on the nature of X. DFT studies suggest a new mechanism for bimetallic &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination, where the rate dependence arises from the steric pressure imposed by the X group on the opposing trans face of the dinickel macrocycle. This work enhances understanding of bimetallic elementary reactions, particularly &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination, which have not been well&#8208;explored for dinuclear systems.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Novel bimetallic elementary reactions&lt;/b&gt;: The oxidative addition of some simple electrophiles to a highly planar dinickel complex with a macrocyclic ligand, Ni&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;sup&gt;tBu&lt;/sup&gt;PONNOPONNO), are described. These reactions form dinickel alkyl complexes of the type Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;-R). The process of &#946;-hydride elimination from dinickel ethyl complexes Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;-Et) was then investigated experimentally and computationally and found to proceed by a novel bimetallic mechanism.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dinickel(I) complex Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;sup&gt;tBu&lt;/sup&gt;PONNOPONNO), featuring a planar macrocyclic diphosphoranide ligand &lt;sup&gt;tBu&lt;/sup&gt;PONNOPONNO, offers a unique architectural platform for observing bimetallic elementary reactions. Oxidative addition reactions of alkyl halides produce dinickel(II) complexes of the type Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;-R)(&#956;-X)(&lt;sup&gt;tBu&lt;/sup&gt;PONNOPONNO). However, when R=Et &#946;-hydride elimination is observed to form a dinickel monohydride, with the rate dependent on the nature of X. DFT studies suggest a new mechanism for bimetallic &#946;-hydride elimination, where the rate dependence arises from the steric pressure imposed by the X group on the opposing &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; face of the dinickel macrocycle. This work enhances understanding of bimetallic elementary reactions, particularly &#946;-hydride elimination, which have not been well-explored for dinuclear systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Alcohol&#8208;Induced Conformation Changes and Thermodynamic Signatures in the Binding of Polyphenols to Proline&#8208;Rich Salivary Proteins</title>

The first contact of tannins, such as ellagic acid, with the human body occurs in the mouth, where they are known to interact with proline&#8208;rich proteins, leading to the development of astringency. Upon addition of &#8764;10&#8197;vol.% EtOH, as present in wines, significant differences in binding strength and stoichiometry were observed, which, dependent on the binding motif, lead to differences in the thermodynamic signatures of the binding process.







Abstract
The first contact of polyphenols (tannins) with the human body occurs in the mouth, where they are known to interact with proline&#8208;rich proteins (PRPs). These interactions are important at a sensory level, especially for the development of astringency, but affect also various other biochemical processes. Employing thermodynamic measurements, fluorescence and CD spectroscopy, we investigated the binding process of the prototypical polyphenol ellagic acid (EA) to different IB&#8208;PRPs and BSA, also in the presence of ethanol, which is known to influence tannin&#8211;protein interactions. Binding of EA to BSA and the small peptide IB7&#8208;14 is weak, but very strong to IB9&#8208;37. The differences in binding strength and stoichiometry are due to differences in the binding motifs, which also lead to differences in the thermodynamic signatures of the binding process. EA binding to BSA is enthalpy&#8208;driven, whereas binding to both IB7&#8208;14 and IB9&#8208;37 is entropy&#8208;driven. The presence of 10&#8197;vol.% EtOH, as present in wines, increases the binding constant of EA with BSA and IB7&#8208;14 drastically, but not that with IB9&#8208;37; however, it changes the binding stoichiometry. These differences can be attributed to the effect of EtOH on the conformation dynamics of the proteins and to changes in hydration properties in alcoholic solution.

         <title>The Facile Hydrolysis of Imidazolinium Chlorides (N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Precursors) Under Basic Aqueous Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 67, December 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrolysis of imidazolinium chlorides takes place readily in a basic water/dichloromethane biphasic mixture at room temperature. Experimental conditions were optimized to afford full conversions and high yields of &#947;&#8208;aminoformamides starting from symmetrical or unsymmetrical substrates. Structural parameters that affect the resilience of these important NHC precursors in the presence of moisture were investigated. In particular, the critical influence of the counteranion was highlighted.







Abstract
The hydrolysis of imidazolinium chlorides takes place readily in a basic water/dichloromethane biphasic mixture at room temperature. Experimental parameters were optimized to afford full conversions and high yields of &#947;&#8208;aminoformamides starting from twelve symmetrical substrates with alkyl or aryl substituents on their nitrogen atoms, and five unsymmetrical 1&#8208;alkyl&#8208;3&#8208;arylimidazolinium chlorides. NMR and XRD analyses showed that the cleavage of unsymmetrical salts led to &#947;&#8208;alkylamino&#8208;N&#8208;arylformamides with a high regioselectivity and that bulky alkyl or aryl groups on the formamide moiety led to the isolation of the (E)&#8208;isomer in high stereoisomeric purity (&gt;95&#8201;%), whereas smaller and more flexible alkyl substituents afforded mixtures of (E)&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;rotamers. Control experiments showed that the hydrolysis of 1,3&#8208;dimesitylimidazolinium chloride (SIMes&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HCl) did not occur readily in pure or acidic water and that the presence of bulky aromatic substituents on the nitrogen atoms of 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolinium chloride (SIDip&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HCl) efficiently slowed down its hydrolysis under basic aqueous conditions. Most strikingly, this work highlighted the critical influence of the counteranion on the reactivity of imidazolinium cations. Indeed, the chloride salts underwent a facile hydrolysis in the presence of water and Na2CO3, whereas various other NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HX derivatives reacted much slower or remained essentially inert under these conditions.

         <title>Fluorination Influences the Bioisostery of Myo&#8208;Inositol Pyrophosphate Analogs</title>

How do pyrophosphate analogs compare? The synthesis of a fluorinated analog of an inositol pyrophosphate messenger is reported. Comparison of the physicochemical and biochemical properties of a range of closely related analogs showcases that subtle modifications can distinctly influence the behavior of molecules.







Abstract
Inositol pyrophosphates (PP&#8722;IPs) are densely phosphorylated messenger molecules involved in numerous biological processes. PP&#8722;IPs contain one or two pyrophosphate group(s) attached to a phosphorylated myo&#8208;inositol ring. 5PP&#8722;IP5 is the most abundant PP&#8722;IP in human cells. To investigate the function and regulation by PP&#8722;IPs in biological contexts, metabolically stable analogs have been developed. Here, we report the synthesis of a new fluorinated phosphoramidite reagent and its application for the synthesis of a difluoromethylene bisphosphonate analog of 5PP&#8722;IP5. Subsequently, the properties of all currently reported analogs were benchmarked using a number of biophysical and biochemical methods, including co&#8208;crystallization, ITC, kinase activity assays and chromatography. Together, the results showcase how small structural alterations of the analogs can have notable effects on their properties in a biochemical setting and will guide in the choice of the most suitable analog(s) for future investigations.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Extended Hexapyrrolylbenzenes: Exploring Charge&#8208;Transfer Phenomena in Donor&#8208;Acceptor Propellers</title>

Hexapyrrolylbenzenes bearing electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor pyrrole units undergo charge transfer upon irradiation. It is most efficient between ortho&#8208;positioned donors and acceptors, for which it can occur even in non&#8208;polar solvents, but it will also take place between para&#8208;substituents in more polar media.







Abstract
A family of propeller&#8208;shaped donor&#8208;acceptor hexapyrrolylbenzenes (HPBs) were designed and synthesized by sequential nucleophilic substitution of hexafluorobenzene with &#960;&#8208;extended pyrroles. In particular, four hybrids were obtained, containing various combinations of electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor acenaphthylene&#8208;fused pyrroles. Additionally, to probe the efficiency of ortho transfer interactions, a system was designed containing unique donor and acceptor subunits spatially separated with four unfunctionalized pyrroles. DFT calculations showed propeller&#8208;shaped geometries of all HPB molecules and separation of frontier molecular orbitals between donor and acceptor subunits. Steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved photophysical measurements revealed charge&#8208;transfer (CT) character of the emission with strong positive dependence on solvent polarity. The principal CT pathway involves ortho&#8208;positioned pairs of donors and acceptors and requires bending of the acceptor in the excited state.

The principal CT pathway involves &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-positioned pairs of donors and acceptors and requires bending of the acceptor in the excited state.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Challenging World of Simple Inorganic Rings: Revisiting Roesky's Ketone and Roesky's Sulfoxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 67, December 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Performing Molecular Orbital calculations on unsaturated sulfur&#8208;nitrogen rings remains a challenging task. One particular unresolved issue was the large difference between the experimental solid&#8208;state geometries and the gas&#8208;phase geometries of two five&#8208;membered ring systems, calculated by a variety of methods including DFT, MP4(SDQ) and CCSD(T). New solid&#8208;state and Valence Bond calculations present a partial explanation, even though a full final answer fails to emerge.







Abstract
The surprising differences between the experimental solid&#8208;state and calculated gas&#8208;phase structures of 5&#8208;oxo&#8208;1,3,2,4&#8208;dithiadiazole (Roesky's ketone, 1) and 1&#8208;oxo&#8208;1,2,4,3,5&#8208;trithiadiazole (Roesky's sulfoxide, 2), identified and studied in a series of papers published between 2004 and 2010 but then never satisfactorily explained, have been revisited, making use of the more advanced computational possibilities currently available. The previous calculations&#8217; considerable overestimations of the C&#8722;S and S&#8722;S bond lengths in 1 and 2, respectively, have been partly explained based on the results of periodic calculations and the application of Valence Bond (VB) Theory. In the case of 1, the crystal environment appears to stabilize a structure with a highly polarized C=O bond, which features a C&#8722;S bond with considerable double&#8208;bond character &#8211; an effect which does not exist for the isolated molecule &#8211; explaining the much shorter bond in the solid state. For 2, a similar conclusion can be drawn for the S&#8722;S distance. For both compounds, though, packing effects are not the sole source of the differences: the inability of Density Functional Theory (DFT) to properly deal with the electronic structures of these apparently simple main&#8208;group systems remains a contributing factor.

         <title>Functionalization of Dodecaborates by Mild and Efficient Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Formation of B&#8722;C Bonds with Boronic Acids
</title>

Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling between iodo&#8208;dodecaborate and organic boronic acids succeeds. DavePhos is optimal as ligand. For electron&#8208;rich aromatics and aliphatics, CD3CN is best solvent, and N&#8208;methylpyrrolidone for electron&#8208;poor aromatics.







Abstract
Hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic molecules have recently received great interest due to their unique properties, which give access to their implementation in biological and material sciences. Herein, a new synthetic approach for the direct&#8208;linkage of the purely inorganic dodecaborate cluster to organic building blocks through B&#8722;C bond is established, using boronic acids as functional groups on the organic moiety, reacting under Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling conditions with iodo&#8208;undecahydridododecaborate. The choices of ligand (DavePhos) and solvent (N&#8208;methylpyrrolidone for electron&#8208;poor, CD3CN for electron&#8208;rich groups) are essential for the successful coupling. Ultimately, the newly described methodology is found to be functional&#8208;group tolerant covering a wide spectrum of substrates including electron&#8208;poor arenes.

         <title>Symmetrical and Mixed Tris(acyl)phosphines: Synthesis, Oxidation and Photochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 67, December 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Symmetrical and mixed tris(acyl)phosphines: In this contribution, we present a convenient synthetic procedure starting from red phosphorus to tris(acyl)phosphines (TAPs) and moreover to tris(acyl)phosphine oxides (TAPOs). Several of the synthesized TAPs exhibit a phosphine&#8208;phophaalkene equilibrium, which was studied in detail. The oxidation of some selected TAPs yielded the corresponding TAPOs, which were tested as potential photoinitiators for application.







Abstract
Herein, we present a convenient synthesis for symmetrical and mixed substituted tris(acyl)phosphines (TAPs) starting from red phosphorus. All TAPs exhibit a phosphaalkene&#8208;acylphosphine equilibrium, which was investigated in detail by variable&#8208;temperature (VT) NMR spectroscopy supported by density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations. Depending on the substituents, two phosphaalkene derivatives and ten acylphosphine derivatives could be isolated. NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography enabled a clear structural assignment of these compounds. Oxidation of selected TAPs led to the formation of the corresponding tris(acyl)phosphine oxides (TAPOs). Furthermore, their spectroscopic properties as well as their photochemistry was investigated. Especially, the TAPO compounds were evaluated for their suitability as photoinitiators by CIDNP spectroscopy, photobleaching measurements and by storage stability tests.

Defluorinative 1,3&#8208;dienylation: A carbene strategy for the defluorinative 1,3&#8208;dienylation of fluoroalkyl N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones is reported. This method allowed for the preparation of &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;vinyl allyl ketones in high yield with excellent functional group tolerance.







Abstract
A silver&#8208;catalyzed regioselective defluorinative 1,3&#8208;dienylation of trifluoromethyl phenyl N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones using homoallenols as 1,3&#8208;dienyl sources provides a variety of &#945;&#8208;(di)fluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;vinyl allyl ketones with excellent functional group tolerance in moderate to good yields. The reaction proceeds through a silver carbene&#8208;initiated sequential etherification and Claisen type [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement cascade. The synthetic utility of this protocol was demonstrated through the downstream synthetic elaboration toward diverse synthetically useful building blocks.

         <title>Biasing the Formation of Solution&#8208;Unstable Intermediates in Coordination Self&#8208;Assembly by Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 67, December 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solvent&#8208;free ball&#8208;mill approach is developed to modulate coordination self&#8208;assembly energy landscapes, allowing access to self&#8208;assembly intermediates in the solid state that are too short&#8208;lived to be observed in traditional solution&#8208;based approaches.







Abstract
Due to the reversible nature of coordination bonds and solvation effect, coordination self&#8208;assembly pathways are often difficult to elucidate experimentally in solution, as intermediates and products are in constant equilibration. The present study shows that some of these transient and high&#8208;energy self&#8208;assembly intermediates can be accessed by means of ball&#8208;milling approaches. Among them, highly aqueous&#8208;unstable Pd3L11 and Pd6L14 open&#8208;cage intermediates of the framed Fujita Pd6L14 cage and Pd2L22, Pd3L21 and Pd4L22 intermediates of Mukherjee Pd6L24 capsule are successfully trapped in solid&#8208;state, where Pd=tmedaPd2+, L1=2,4,6&#8208;tris(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine and L2=1,3,5&#8208;tris(1&#8208;imidazolyl)benzene). Their structures are assigned by a combination of solution&#8208;based characterization tools such as standard NMR spectroscopy, DOSY&#8197;NMR, ESI&#8208;MS and X&#8208;ray diffraction. Collectively, these results highlight the opportunity of using mechanochemistry to access unique chemical space with vastly different reactivity compared to conventional solution&#8208;based supramolecular self&#8208;assembly reactions.

C3&#8208;symmetric chiral cage&#8208;shaped phosphites were developed as a new type of chiral ligand. Their Lewis basicity and chiral environment are precisely controlled by the tethered group. The cage&#8208;shaped phosphites successfully worked as chiral ligands in Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric conjugate additions, realizing acceptable yields with excellent enantioselectivity, and were used to synthesize a pharmacologically important molecule.







Abstract
Designing chiral ligands with an axial symmetry higher than C2&#8208;rotational symmetry is one of the most crucial approaches to improving enantioselectivity in asymmetric synthesis. Herein, C3&#8208;symmetric chiral cage&#8208;shaped phosphites are reported. Their Lewis basicity and chiral environment are precisely controlled by the tethered group. The cage&#8208;shaped phosphites successfully worked as chiral ligands in Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric conjugate additions, realizing acceptable yields with excellent enantioselectivity, and were used to synthesize a pharmacologically important molecule.

         <title>Planar Hexacoordinate Beryllium: Covalent Bonding Between s&#8211;block Metals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 67, December 1, 2023. </description>

Clusters with covalent bonds: To investigate the potential for planar hypercoordination in s&#8208;block metals, we report a planar hexacoordinate beryllium center in the neutral binary Be&#169;Be6Cl6 cluster. This global minimum is dynamic stabilized and displays the 6&#963;/2&#960; double aromaticity. Interestingly, chemical bonding analysis further highlights a substantial covalent interaction between the ligand beryllium atoms and the central metal beryllium atoms.







Abstract
Achieving a planar hypercoordinate arrangement of s&#8208;block metals through covalent bonding with ligands is challenging due to the strong ionicity involved. Herein, we report the first case of a neutral binary global minimum containing a planar hexacoordinate beryllium atom. The central Be atom is coordinated by six active Be atoms, the latter in turn are enclosed by an equal number of more electronegative chlorine atoms in the periphery, forming a star&#8208;like phBe cluster (Be&#169;Be6Cl6). Importantly, the cluster exhibits dynamically stabilized stemming geometrically from the appropriate matching of metal&#8208;ligand size and electronically from adherence to the octet rule as well as possessing a 6&#963;/2&#960; double aromaticity. Remarkably, energy decomposition analysis&#8208;natural orbitals for chemical valence (EDA&#8208;NOCV) analysis reveals a significant covalent interaction between the ligand and the central metal beryllium atoms, a fact further supported by a large Wiberg bond index. This cluster is a promising synthetic as its excellent electronic, dynamic and thermodynamic stability.

         <dc:description>
Initial experimental findings during optimization of a NiII&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective Negishi cross&#8208;coupling reaction revealed the importance of higher&#8208;order zincates as the transmetallating active species. An easy synthesis procedure for such zincates was developed and applied to a variety of potentially useful solid monoaryl higher&#8208;order zincates. Finally, the advantages of these reagents in different cross&#8208;coupling reactions were exemplified.







Abstract
The Negishi cross&#8208;coupling reactions involves the application of organozinc reagents and is a highly versatile reaction in synthetic organic chemistry. The transmetallation step plays a pivotal role in the mechanism of these types of cross&#8208;coupling reactions. In this study, mechanistic investigations are presented indicating that higher&#8208;order zincates are the transmetallating active species in Pd&#8208; and Ni&#8208;catalyzed Negishi cross&#8208;coupling reactions. These findings are supported by halide salt addition experiments and by obtaining a single X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the solid monoaryl higher&#8208;order zincate [1&#8208;NaphthylZnX3]2&#8722;Mg(THF)22+. The procedure developed in this work was further applied to the synthesis of various monoaryl higher&#8208;order zincates, after which their synthetic usefulness in terms of high reactivity towards transmetallation in Negishi cross&#8208;couplings, as well as stability, was exemplified in several reactions.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Propargylboration of Ketones with Allenyl&#8208;Bpins: Highly Stereoselective Synthesis of tert&#8208;Homopropargyl Alcohols Bearing Vicinal Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 67, December 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tertiary homopropargyl alcohols bearing vicinal stereocenters can be obtained through catalyst&#8208;free propargylboration of ketones with general allenyl&#8208;Bpins. The key factor for the success is enhancing the reactivity of the Bpin unit in&#8208;situ by sequentially adding 1.25&#8197;equiv. of nBuLi and 2.0&#8197;equiv. of TFAA. Additionally, propargylboration of ketones with chiral trisubstituted allenyl&#8208;Bpins enables the asymmetric synthesis of enantiomerically enriched tert&#8208;homopropargyl alcohols with complete chirality transfer.







Abstract
A practical and efficient propargylboration of ketones is presented using general allenylboronic acid pinacol esters (allenyl&#8208;Bpins) without a catalyst. This reaction is triggered by in&#8208;situ activation of stable allenyl&#8208;Bpins through the sequential addition of 1.25&#8197;equiv. of nBuLi and the prerequisite 2.0&#8197;equiv. of TFAA. Under the optimized reaction conditions, the versatile trisubstituted allenyl&#8208;Bpins react with various ketones smoothly to afford a wide range of tert&#8208;homopropargyl alcohols bearing vicinal stereocenters in high yields with good to excellent diastereoselectivities. Furthermore, propargylboration of ketones with chiral trisubstituted allenyl&#8208;Bpins allows for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral tert&#8208;homopropargyl alcohols with a full chirality transfer.

&lt;/sup&gt;BuLi and 2.0&#8197;equiv. of TFAA. Additionally, propargylboration of ketones with chiral trisubstituted allenyl-Bpins enables the asymmetric synthesis of enantiomerically enriched &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-homopropargyl alcohols with complete chirality transfer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A practical and efficient propargylboration of ketones is presented using general allenylboronic acid pinacol esters (allenyl-Bpins) without a catalyst. This reaction is triggered by in-situ activation of stable allenyl-Bpins through the sequential addition of 1.25&#8197;equiv. of &lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;BuLi and the prerequisite 2.0&#8197;equiv. of TFAA. Under the optimized reaction conditions, the versatile trisubstituted allenyl-Bpins react with various ketones smoothly to afford a wide range of &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-homopropargyl alcohols bearing vicinal stereocenters in high yields with good to excellent diastereoselectivities. Furthermore, propargylboration of ketones with chiral trisubstituted allenyl-Bpins allows for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-homopropargyl alcohols with a full chirality transfer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tracking SF5I in the Iodopentafluorosulfanylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 67, December 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The iodopentafluorosulfanylation of alkynes was made possible through formal manipulation of SF5I. This method requires the combination SF5Cl/KI/18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 in THF at low temperature. Mechanistic investigations by DFT revealed that a ionic pathway is not viable and a radical mechanism is preponderant.







Abstract
In the vibrant field of SF5 chemistry, SF5X reagents (X=F, Cl, Br) are at the heart of current investigations in radical pentafluorosulfanylation reactions. SF5I is the missing link whose existence has not been reported despite its potential as SF5 donor. This study reports the formal addition of the hitherto unknown SF5I reagent to alkynes by means of a combination of SF5Cl/KI/18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 ether. The exclusive regio&#8208; and stereoselective synthesis of unprecedented (E)&#8208;1&#8208;iodo&#8208;2&#8208;(pentafluoro&#8208;&#955;6&#8208;sulfanyl) alkenes was achieved. A consensus was reached through computational and mechanistic studies for the realistic formation of SF5&#8722; anion but not SF5I in solution and the rational involvement of SF5&#8901; and iodine radicals in the iodo pentafluorosulfanylation reaction.

         <title>NHC&#8208;Stabilized Dialanes(4) of Al2Mes4</title>

NHC&#8208;stabilized dialanes(4). Synthesis and reactivity of mono&#8208; or bis&#8208;NHC&#8208;stabilized dialanes(4) (NHC)&#8901;Al2Mes4 and (NHC)2&#8901;Al2Mes4 are reported. These compounds reveal relatively long Al&#8722;Al bonds according to their XRD structures, which was verified by DFT calculations. QTAIM analysis on (IMeMe)2&#8901;Al2Mes4 7 revealed non&#8208;nuclear attractors (NNA) along the aluminum aluminum vector. First reactivity studies on (IMeMe)2&#8901;Al2Mes4 7 demonstrate that NHC&#8208;ligated dialanes are thermally robust and storable synthons for the dialane(4) Al2Mes4. The synthesis of (IMeMe)&#8901;AlClMes2 10, {(IMeMe)&#8901;AlMes2}2&#8208;E (E=O 11, S 12), and the dimetallaacetylide {(IMeMe)&#8901;AlMes2}2&#8208;&#956;&#8208;(C&#8801;C) 13 is reported starting from 7.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of novel N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) stabilized dialanes Al2Mes4 as well as first investigations concerning the reactivity of these compounds are reported. The synthesis of these compounds proceeds via the mesityl&#8208;substituted alanes (NHC)&#8901;AlHMes2 (NHC=IMeMe{=1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene}, IiPrMe {=1,3&#8208;di&#8208;iso&#8208;propyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethylimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene}) and iodo&#8208;alanes (NHC)&#8901;AlIMes2 (NHC=IMeMe, IiPrMe). Metallic reduction of (NHC)&#8901;AlIMes2 afforded the new NHC&#8208;stabilized dialanes (NHC)2&#8901;Al2Mes4 (NHC=IMeMe, IiPrMe). The NHC&#8208;ligated dialanes are thermally robust and storable synthons for the dialane Al2Mes4. First reactivity studies on (IMeMe)2&#8901;Al2Mes4 towards small molecules confirm this, as this compound shows controlled and selective reactions with several substrates. Reaction with CuCl leads to oxidation of the dialane and formation of (IMeMe)&#8901;AlClMes2, reactions with pyridine N&#8208;oxide and tBu&#8722;N=C=S, respectively, gave the chalcogenide&#8208;bridged dimers {(IMeMe)&#8901;AlMes2}2&#8208;&#956;&#8208;E (E=O, S), and reaction with acetylene afforded the dimetallaacetylide {(IMeMe)&#8901;AlMes2}2&#8208;&#956;&#8208;(C&#8801;C).

In a phosphorus mine, the acid chloride workers are shoveling red phosphorus to provide the chemicals necessary to produce the Brandsma reagent. This reaction leads to the formation of symmetrical and mixed trisacylphosphines. As these are in equilibrium with their corresponding phosphaalkenes, the trisacylphosphine form is enriched by increasing the temperature, as represented by the Bunsen burner. Production is then completed by oxidation to the corresponding symmetrical and mixed trisacylphosphine oxides, which is represented by the oxygen tank. More information can be found in the Research Article by G. Gescheidt, H. Gr&#252;tzmacher, M. Haas and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302535).

The first contact of polyphenols, such as tannins from red grapes, with the human body takes place in the mouth, where they interact with salivary proteins. These interactions are important at the sensory level, especially for the development of astringency. We have studied the binding process of the polyphenol ellagic acid to different salivary proteins. The presence of 10&#8197;vol.&#8201;% EtOH, as found in wines, dramatically increases the binding constant of ellagic acid with salivary proteins; this can be attributed to the effect of EtOH on the conformational dynamics and hydration of the proteins. More information can be found in the Research Article by N. Jahmidi&#8208;Azizi, R. Oliva and R. Winter (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302384).

The toolbox is full of boronic acids for Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling. To connect them to the dodecaborate cluster, special tools are necessary: iodine as leaving group on the dodecaborate, DavePhos as special ligand, and solvents that differ for electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor boronic acids. With these tools, the coupling can be carried out successfully. More information can be found in the Research Article by D. Gabel and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302466).

         <title>Biomass Separators as a &#8220;Lifesaver&#8221; for Safe and Long&#8208;Life Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 67, December 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review describes the application of biomass materials in lithium&#8208;metal battery separators. Three types of separators are outlined and the different mechanisms of biomass separators with different structures in inhibiting the generation of lithium dendrites and shuttle effect are described.







Abstract
The growth of lithium dendrites and the shuttle of polysulfides in lithium metal batteries (LMBs) have hindered their development. In LMBs, the cathode and anode are separated by a separator, although this does not solve the battery&#8216;s issues. The use of biomass materials is widespread for modifying the separator due to their porous structure and abundant functional groups. LMBs perform more electrochemically when lithium ions are deposited uniformly and polysulfide shuttling is reduced using biomass separators. In this review, we analyze the growth of lithium dendrite and the shuttle of polysulfide in LMBs, summarize the types of biomass separator materials and the mechanisms of action (providing mechanical barriers, promoting uniform deposition of metal ions, capturing polysulfides, shielding polysulfide). The prospect of developing new separator materials from the perspective of regulating ion transport and physical sieving efficiency as well as the application of advanced technologies such as synchrotron radiation to characterize the mechanism of action of biomass separators is also proposed.

         <title>Enrichment Strategies for Efficient CO2 Electroreduction in Acidic Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 67, December 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enriching CO2 and key intermediates around the catalyst surface can promote the reaction rate and selectivity, providing a promising way to boost the performance of CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). In this review, the key technique challenges of acidic CO2RR are first introduced. Then, the critical progress of the enrichment strategy for promoting the acidic CO2RR is summarized with three aspects: catalyst design, electrolyte regulation, and electrolyzer optimization. Finally, some insights and perspectives for further development of enrichment strategy in acidic CO2RR are expounded.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has been recognized as an appealing route to remarkably accelerate the carbon&#8208;neutral cycle and reduce carbon emissions. Notwithstanding great catalytic activity that has been acquired in neutral and alkaline conditions, the carbonates generated from the inevitable reaction of the input CO2 with the hydroxide severely lower carbon utilization and energy efficiency. By contrast, CO2RR in an acidic condition can effectively circumvent the carbonate issues; however, the activity and selectivity of CO2RR in acidic electrolytes will be decreased significantly due to the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Enriching the CO2 and the key intermediates around the catalyst surface can promote the reaction rate and enhance the product selectivity, providing a promising way to boost the performance of CO2RR. In this review, the catalytic mechanism and key technique challenges of CO2RR are first introduced. Then, the critical progress of enrichment strategies for promoting the CO2RR in the acidic electrolyte is summarized with three aspects: catalyst design, electrolyte regulation, and electrolyzer optimization. Finally, some insights and perspectives for further development of enrichment strategies in acidic CO2RR are expounded.

Efficient hydrogenations of terminal alkenes with molecular hydrogen catalyzed by well&#8208;defined bench stable Mn(I) complexes containing an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;based PCP pincer ligand are described.







Abstract
Efficient hydrogenations of terminal alkenes with molecular hydrogen catalyzed by well&#8208;defined bench stable Mn(I) complexes containing an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;based PCP pincer ligand are described. These reactions are environmentally benign and atom economic, implementing an inexpensive, earth abundant non&#8208;precious metal catalyst. A range of aromatic and aliphatic alkenes were efficiently converted into alkanes in good to excellent yields.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efficient hydrogenations of terminal alkenes with molecular hydrogen catalyzed by well-defined bench stable Mn(I) complexes containing an N-heterocyclic carbene-based PCP pincer ligand are described. These reactions are environmentally benign and atom economic, implementing an inexpensive, earth abundant non-precious metal catalyst. A range of aromatic and aliphatic alkenes were efficiently converted into alkanes in good to excellent yields. The hydrogenation proceeds at 100&#8201;&#176;C with catalyst loadings of 0.25&#8211;0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;%, 2.5&#8211;5&#8197;mol&#8201;% base (KO&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;Bu) and a hydrogen pressure of 20&#8197;bar. Mechanistic insight into the catalytic reaction is provided by means of DFT calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Discotic Star Mesogen with Thymine Nucleobases Exhibiting a Rare Gyroid Cubic Mesophase with 3D Conductivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flipping disc networks: A discotic star shaped mesogen decorated with three DNA bases thymine reversibly switches between a columnar and an extraordinary bicontinuous cubic network. The double nanosegregated bicontinuous structure is stabilized by self&#8208;association of hydrogen bonding thymines and realize a 3D charge transport. A phase flipping is also discerned by the addition of adenine as complementary base.







Abstract
A unique gyroid cubic phase has been discovered for a discotic star mesogen with three covalently attached DNA bases. In this cubic 
 phase, the conjugated core of the mesogens and the thymine pseudo guests self&#8208;assemble in mirror image continuous networks, representing a semiconducting material with three&#8208;dimensional transport pathways. The hole carrier mobilities are found to be in the typical range of poly(phenylenevinylene) scaffolds. This structure is stabilized by a weak hydrogen bonding between the thymine bases and can be switched to a columnar liquid crystal &#8211; thermally and by the addition of complementary adenine guests.

         <title>Exploring the Role of Metal in the Biointeraction of Metallacarboranes with C. elegans Embryos</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have transitioned from performing chemical scale studies involving the interaction of metallabis(dicarbollides) with biomolecules in a round&#8208;bottom flask, to now conducting in&#8197;vivo experiments using C. elegans. Results suggest metal (Fe or Co) plays a crucial role in C. elegans at the L4 stage and in embryos, and shows a stronger interaction with ferra compared to cobaltabis(dicarbollides).







Abstract
Cobaltabis(dicarbollides), ferrabis(dicarbollide), and their halogenated derivatives are the most studied metallacarboranes with great medical potential. These versatile compounds and their iodinated derivatives can be used in chemotherapy, radiotherapy, particle therapy, and bioimaging when isotopes are used. These metallacarboranes have been evaluated in&#8197;vitro and recently in&#8197;vivo with complex animal models. Lately, these studies have been complemented using the invertebrate Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), a nematode largely used in toxicology. When evaluated at the L4 stage, cobaltabis(dicarbollides), ([o&#8208;COSAN]&#8722; and [8,8&#8217;&#8208;I2&#8208;o&#8208;COSAN]&#8722;), exhibited a higher mean lethal dose (LD50) than ferrabis(dicarbollides) ([o&#8208;FESAN]&#8722; and [8,8&#8217;&#8208;I2&#8208;o&#8208;FESAN]&#8722;). In this work, we used the C. elegans embryos since they are a complex biological barrier with concentric layers of polysaccharides and proteins that protect them from the environment. We assessed if the metal atom changes their biointeraction with the C. elegans embryos. First, we assessed the effects on embryo development for metallacarboranes and their di&#8208;iodinated derivatives. We observed changes in color and in their surface structure. An exhaustive physicochemical characterization was performed to understand better this interaction, revealing a stronger interaction of ferrabis(dicarbollide) compounds with C. elegans embryos than the cobaltabis(dicarbollide) molecules. Unveiling the biological interaction of these compounds is of great interest for their future biomedical applications.

         <title>Molecular Adhesion of a Pilus&#8208;Derived Peptide Involved in Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilm Formation on Non&#8208;Polar ZnO&#8208;Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PAK(128&#8211;144)&#8208;peptide adsorption revealed high affinity towards etched single&#8208;crystalline ZnO(11
0) surfaces with adhesion forces ranging up to 600&#8197;pN, measured by Single&#8208;Molecule Force Spectroscopy (SMFS). With the application of the Bell&#8208;Evans theory and complementary peptide adsorption studies, we decipher possible adhesion mechanisms to originate from coordination&#8208; and hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
Bacterial colonization and biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces are initiated by the adhesion of peptides and proteins. Understanding the adhesion of such peptides and proteins at a molecular level thus represents an important step toward controlling and suppressing biofilm formation on technological and medical materials. This study investigates the molecular adhesion of a pilus&#8208;derived peptide that facilitates biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a multidrug&#8208;resistant opportunistic pathogen frequently encountered in healthcare settings. Single&#8208;molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) was performed on chemically etched ZnO
 surfaces to gather insights about peptide adsorption force and its kinetics. Metal&#8208;free click chemistry for the fabrication of peptide&#8208;terminated SMFS cantilevers was performed on amine&#8208;terminated gold cantilevers and verified by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and polarization&#8208;modulated infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (PM&#8208;IRRAS). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and XPS analyses reveal stable topographies and surface chemistries of the substrates that are not affected by SMFS. Rupture events described by the worm&#8208;like chain model (WLC) up to 600&#8197;pN were detected for the non&#8208;polar ZnO surfaces. The dissociation barrier energy at zero force &#916;G(0), the transition state distance xb and bound&#8208;unbound dissociation rate at zero force koff(0) for the single crystalline substrate indicate that coordination and hydrogen bonds dominate the peptide/surface interaction.

         <title>Quo Vadis CO2 Activation: Catalytic Reduction of CO2 to Methanol Using Aluminum and Gallium/Carbon&#8208;based Ambiphiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stoichiometric vs. Catalytic: The herein reported aluminum and gallium/carbon&#8208;based ambiphiles, a new class of hidden frustrated Lewis pairs consisting of a phosphorus ylide featuring an aluminum or gallium fragment in the ortho position of a phenyl ring scaffold, react stoichiometrically with CO2 forming the stable adducts but also act as an efficient catalyst for the reduction of CO2 mediated by HBpin.







Abstract
We report on so&#8208;called &#8220;hidden FLPs&#8221; (FLP: frustrated Lewis pair) consisting of a phosphorus ylide featuring a group 13 fragment in the ortho position of a phenyl ring scaffold to form five&#8208;membered ring structures. Although the formation of the Lewis acid/base adducts was observed in the solid state, most of the title compounds readily react with carbon dioxide to provide stable insertion products. Strikingly, 0.3&#8211;3.0&#8197;mol% of the reported aluminum and gallium/carbon&#8208;based ambiphiles catalyze the reduction of CO2 to methanol with satisfactory high selectivity and yields using pinacol borane as stoichiometric reduction equivalent. Comprehensive computational studies provided valuable mechanistic insights and shed more light on activity differences.

         <title>Benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond Oxidation with Ketone Selectivity by a Cobalt(IV)&#8208;Oxo Embedded in a &#946;&#8208;Barrel Protein</title>

Artificial metalloenzymes based on a cobalt cofactor show higher activity than the free cobalt complex for the oxidation of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in aqueous medium. The cobalt cofactor is presumably stabilized by the hydrophobic cleft provided by the protein NB4.







Abstract
Artificial metalloenzymes have emerged as biohybrid catalysts that allow to combine the reactivity of a metal catalyst with the flexibility of protein scaffolds. This work reports the artificial metalloenzymes based on the &#946;&#8208;barrel protein nitrobindin NB4, in which a cofactor [CoIIX(Me3TACD&#8208;Mal)]+X&#8722; (X=Cl, Br; Me3TACD=N,N',N''&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane, Mal=CH2CH2CH2NC4H2O2) was covalently anchored via a Michael addition reaction. These biohybrid catalysts showed higher efficiency than the free cobalt complexes for the oxidation of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in aqueous media. Using commercially available oxone (2KHSO5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;KHSO4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;K2SO4) as oxidant, a total turnover number of up to 220 and 97&#8201;% ketone selectivity were achieved for tetralin. As catalytically active intermediate, a mononuclear terminal cobalt(IV)&#8208;oxo species [Co(IV)=O]2+ was generated by reacting the cobalt(II) cofactor with oxone in aqueous solution and characterized by ESI&#8208;TOF MS.

         <title>Preparation of Carbazoles Involving 6&#960;&#8208;Electrocyclization, Photoredox&#8208;, Electrochemical&#8208;, and Thermal Cyclization Reactions: Mechanistic Insights</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic methods for the preparation of the carbazole moiety are reviewed. These methods describe the formation of new C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bonds under mild conditions enabling broad substrate diversity and functional group tolerance. Photochemical, thermal and electrochemical transformations are described as interesting preparative methodologies.







Abstract
Carbazole is a heterocyclic motif that can be found in a diverse array of natural and unnatural products displaying a wide range of biological and physiological properties. Furthermore, this heterocycle is part of electronic materials like photoconducting polymers and organic optoelectronic materials owing to its excellent photophysical characteristics. Consequently, the development of synthetic strategies for carbazole scaffolds holds potential significance in biological and material fields. In this regard, a variety of preparation methods has been developed to exploit their efficient and distinct formation of new C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bonds under mild conditions and enabling broad substrate diversity and functional group tolerance. Therefore, this review focuses on the synthesis of a set of carbazole derivatives describing a variety of methodologies that involve direct irradiation, photosensitization, photoredox, electrochemical and thermal cyclization reactions.

CASSCF calculations as well as the reactivity toward diphenyl acetylene suggest a notable biradical character in PPI. Reaction with [Cr(CO)3(MeCN)3] affords the complex [Cr(CO)3(&#951;5&#8208;PPI)] (5).

         <title>A Green Environmental Protection Photocatalytic Molecular Reactor for Aerobic Oxidation of Sulfide to Sulfoxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Green and environmental protection has been of particular concern in modern chemistry research. In this work, we report a visible&#8208;light photocatalytic molecular reactor based on a novel zirconium metal&#8208;organic framework (Zr&#8208;MOF) for the aerobic oxidation of sulfide to sulfoxide in water. The Zr&#8208;MOF is constructed from perylenediimides&#8208;based (PDI) carboxylate ligand and [Zr6O8(H2O)8]8+ clusters, and features a 3D (4,8)&#8208;connected csq topological structure with triangular channels of ~5 &#197; and mesoporous hexagonal channels of ~26 &#197; along c&#8208;axis. Interestingly, this Zr&#8208;MOF exhibits visible&#8208;light absorption and efficient photoinduced free radical generation property, making it a promising photocatalytic molecular reactor in water. When it is used as a photocatalyst for the aerobic oxidation of sulfides under irradiation of visible light in water, the Zr&#8208;MOF could afford the corresponding sulfoxides with high yield, selectivity and superior recyclability. Furthermore, the mechanism studies revealed that the singlet oxygen (1O2) and superoxide radical (O2&#183;&#8208;) are the main active species for the catalytic reactions. This work offers a perceptive comprehension of the mechanism in PDI&#8208;based MOFs for further study on photocatalytic reactions.</dc:description>

Furthermore, the mechanism studies revealed that the singlet oxygen (1O2) and superoxide radical (O2&#183;-) are the main active species for the catalytic reactions. This work offers a perceptive comprehension of the mechanism in PDI-based MOFs for further study on photocatalytic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamic Configuration on a Chiral&#8208;at&#8208;rhodium Catalyst Featuring a Flexible Tetradentate Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unique dynamic configuration&#160;of an enantioselective chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal catalyst based on Rh(III) and a non&#8208;chiral tetradentate ligand is described and resolved. At room temperature, the catalyst undergoes a dynamic configuration process leading to the formation of two interconvertible metal&#8208;stereoisomers, remarkably without racemization. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that this metal&#8208;isomerization proceeds via a concerted transition state, which features a trigonal bipyramidal geometry stabilized by the tetradentate ligand. Furthermore, the resolved enantiopure complex shows high catalytic enantioinduction in the Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction, achieving enantiomeric ratios as high as 99:1.</dc:description>

         <title>Modification of a Common&#160;&#946;&#8208;diketiminate NacNac Framework via Sequential Lithiation and Small Molecule Insertion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A widely utilised class of ligands in synthesis and catalysis, &#946;&#8208;diketiminate (BDI) or NacNac compounds were initially considered innocent in the sense that they remained intact in all their applications. That changed when the &#947;&#8208;C&#8208;H unit of their NCCCN backbone was found to engage in reactions with electrophiles. Here, we show that this special reactivity can be used advantageously to prepare tripodal modifications of the common NacNac ligand derived from 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;methyldiketimine [NacNacH (Me, Dipp)]. Lithiation to give NacNacLi, followed by reactions with isocyanates, isothiocyanates and a carbodiimide, have afforded a series of tripodal NacNac variants having N,N,N,O; N,N,N,S; or N,N,N,N potential dentation sites, many of which have been crystallographically characterised. Distinct ligating modes of these new ligands have been elucidated through the crystal structures of their lithiated derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Bisurea&#8208;Based Supramolecular Polymers for Tunable Biomaterials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water&#8208;soluble supramolecular polymers show great potential to develop dynamic biomaterials with tailored properties. Here, we elucidate the morphology, stability and dynamicity of supramolecular polymers derived from bisurea&#8208;based monomers. An accessible synthetic approach from 2,4&#8208;toluene diisocyanate (TDI) as the starting material is developed. TDI has two isocyanates that differ in intrinsic reactivity, which allows to obtain functional, desymmetrized monomers in a one&#8208;step procedure. We explore how the hydrophobic/hydrophilic ratio affects the properties of the formed supramolecular polymers by increasing the number of methylene units from 10 to 12 keeping the hydrophilic hexa(ethylene glycol) constant. All bisurea&#8208;based monomers form long, fibrous structures with 3&#8208;5 monomers in the cross&#8208;section in water, indicating a proper hydrophobic\hydrophilic balance. The stability of the supramolecular polymers increases with an increasing amount of methylene units, whereas the dynamic nature of the monomers decreases. The introduction of one Cy3 dye affords modified supramolecular monomers, which co&#8208;assemble with the unmodified monomers into fibrous structures. All systems show excellent water&#8208;compatibility and no toxicity for different cell&#8208;lines. Importantly, in cell culture media, the fibrous structures remain present, highlighting the stability of these supramolecular polymers in physiological conditions. The results obtained here motivate further investigation of these bisurea&#8208;based building blocks as dynamic biomaterial.</dc:description>

         <title>Activated Mn&#8208;MACHO Complexes Form Stable CO2&#160;Adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manganese(I) carbonyl complexes bearing a MACHO&#8208;type ligand (HN(CH2CH2PR2)2) readily react in their amido form with CO2&#160;to generate 4&#8208;membered {Mn&#8208;N&#8208;C&#8208;O} metallacycles. The stability of the adducts decreases with the steric demand of the R groups at phosphorous (R = isopropyl &gt; adamantyl). The CO2&#8208;adducts display generally a lower reactivity as compared to the parent amido complexes. These adducts can thus be interpretated as masked forms of the active amido catalysts and potentially play important roles as off&#8208;loop species or branching points in catalytic transformations of carbon dioxide.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Ionic Li+@C70 Endohedral Fullerene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ion&#8208;endohedral&#8208;fullerene has attracted growing interest due to the unique electronic and structural characteristics arising from its distinctive ionic nature. Although there has been only one reported ion&#8208;encapsulated fullerene, Li+@C60, a significant number of fundamental and applied studies have been conducted, making a substantial impact not only in chemistry and physics but also across various interdisciplinary research fields. Nevertheless, studies on ion&#8208;endohedral fullerenes are still in their infancy due to the limitations in variety, and hence, it remains an open question how the size and symmetry of fullerene, as well as the motion and position of the encapsulated ion, affect their physical/chemical properties. Herein, we report the synthesis of lithium&#8208;ion&#8208;endohedral [70]fullerene (Li+@C70 X&#8722;, X=PF6&#8722; and TFSI&#8722;), a novel ionic endohedral fullerene. X&#8208;ray crystallography confirmed the encapsulation of Li+ by C70 cage as well as its ion&#8208;pair structure stabilized by external TFSI&#8722; counter anion. The encapsulated Li+ drastically lowered the orbital energy of the C70 cage by Coulomb interactions but did not affect the orbital energy gap and degeneracy. DFT studies were also performed, which supported the experimentally observed electronic effects caused by the encapsulated Li+.</dc:description>

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Enthalpy Compensation in Solvent Geometry Regulated Supramolecular Polymerization of Luminescent Napthalimide via a Non&#8208;Cooperative, Isodesmic Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymers of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems are an important class of materials with fascinating functions and properties originated from the dynamic behavior and highly ordered molecular organizations. Here, a donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor based functionalized luminescent napthalene monoimide (NMI) undergoes J&#8208;type self&#8208;assembly by non&#8208;covalent interactions via a non&#8208;cooperative, isodesmic mechanism to form supramolecular 1D nanowire. The fundamental insights into the thermodynamics regulating the supramolecular polymerization were derived through the fitting of the isodesmic model to variable temperature UV/Vis data in linear (dodecane) and nonlinear hydrocarbon (decalin) based solvents. This shows a significant role of entropy&#8208;enthalpy compensation in solvent geometry&#8208;regulated formation and stabilization of supramolecular polymer. Furthermore, we have quantitively estimated the influence of solvent geometry and found that NMI forms stronger self&#8208;assembly and spontaneous gel in linear hydrocarbon based solvent compared to nonlinear one and thereby substantially increases the degree of polymerization in linear hydrocarbon solvent (dodecane). This is accredited to the effective influence of the linear hydrocarbon solvent molecules in the polymerization process by favourable van der Waals&#160;interactions with the peripheral alkyl chains of the NMI monomers in contrast to unfavourable interaction of nonlinear hydrocarbon solvent due to geometry mismatch.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding the Poly (Triazine Imide) Crystals Formation Process: The Conversion from Heptazine to Triazine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poly (triazine imide)&#160;(PTI)&#160;generally&#160;obtained via ionothermal synthesis features extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and enhanced crystallinity. However, in&#8208;depth investigation of the polycondensation&#160;process for PTI is an onerous task due to multiple influencing factors and limited characterization techniques. Herein, to&#160;simplify the polymerization route and exclude non&#8208;essential factors, PTI was prepared by calcining only melamine and LiCl. This&#160;study aims to identify the pivotal role of LiCl in PTI formation, which can convert heptazine&#8208;based intermediates into more stable triazine&#8208;based PTI framework. Based on this discovery, we&#160;demonstrate&#160;the transformation process of the prepared samples from amorphous Bulk g&#8208;C3N4&#160;to regular PTI, and further prove that the reaction with LiCl causes disruption of heptazine covalent organic frameworks.&#160;Additionally,&#160;the PTI exhibits higher&#160;photocatalytic water splitting performance due to efficient charge carrier mobility and separation,&#160;as well as&#160;faster reaction kinetics. This discovery deepens understanding&#160;of the polycondensation&#160;process of PTI crystals and provides insights toward the rational design of crystalline carbon nitride&#8208;based semiconductors.</dc:description>

         <title>Remarkable Off&#8211;On Tunable Solid&#8208;State Luminescence by the Regulation of Pyrene Dimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is always a challenge to achieve &#8220;off&#8211;on&#8221; luminescent switch by regulating non&#8208;covalent interactions. Herein, we report a unique strategy for constructing high performance &#8220;off&#8211;on&#8221; tunable luminescent materials utilizing a novel molecule (TFPA) consist of pyrene and cyanostilbene. The pristine crystal of TFPA is almost non&#8208;emissive. Upon grinding/UV irradiation, an obvious luminescence enhancement is observed. Theoretical and experimental results revealed the underlying mechanism of this intriguing &#8220;off&#8211;on&#8220; switching behavior. The non&#8208;emissive crystal consists of ordered H&#8208;aggregates, with adjacent two molecules stacked in an anti&#8208;parallel manner and no overlapped area in pyrene moieties. When external force is applied by grinding or internal force is introduced through the photoisomerization, the dimer structures are facilitated with shorter intermolecular distances and better overlapping of pyrene moieties. In addition, the &#8220;on&#8221; state can recover to &#8220;off&#8221; state under thermal annealing, showing good reversibility and applicability in intelligence material. The present results promote an in&#8208;depth insight between packing structure and photophysical property, and offer an effective strategy for the construction of luminescence &#8220;off&#8211;on&#8221; switching materials, toward the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive luminescent materials for anti&#8208;counterfeiting.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries demonstrate enormous energy density are promising forms of energy storage. Unfortunately, the slow redox kinetics and polysulfides shuttle effect are some of the factors that prevent the its development. To address these issues, the hybrid membrane with combination of nickel diselenide nanosheets modified carbon nanotubes (NSN@CNTs) and utilized Li2S6&#160;catholyte for lithium sulfur battery. The conductive CNTs facilitates fast electronic/ionic transport, while the polarity of NSN as a strong affinity to lithium polysulfides, effectively anchoring them, facilitating the redox conversion of polysulfide species, and effectively diminishing reaction barriers. The cell with NSN@CNTs delivers the first discharge capacity of 1123.8 mAh g&#8208;1&#160;and maintains 786.5 mAh g&#8208;1&#160;after 300 cycles (0.2 C) at the sulfur loading 5.4 mg. Its rate capability is commendable, enabling it to sustain a capacity of 559.8 mAh g&#8208;1&#160;even at a high discharge rate of 2 C. In addition, its initial discharge capacity can remain 8.33 mAh even at 10.8 mg for duration of 100 cycles.

         <title>Colloidal and Thermal Stability of Three&#8208;Component Hybrid Materials Containing Clay Mineral, Polysaccharide and Surfactant</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The paper presents the colloidal and thermal stability of the three&#8208;component hybrid materials containing halloysite, polysaccharides (alginic acid, cationic cellulose and hydroxyethyl cellulose) and Tritons. The obtained results have the application potential in the formation of the materials for the pollutants removal from water and sewages.







Abstract
The paper presents the colloidal and thermal stability of the three&#8208;component hybrid materials containing halloysite, polysaccharides (alginic acid, cationic cellulose and hydroxyethyl cellulose) and Tritons. TX&#8208;100, TX&#8208;165 and TX&#8208;405 were used as non&#8208;ionic surfactants. Stability and other properties of the hybrid materials were tested by the following methods: UV&#8211;Vis, TGA (thermogravimetric analysis) and DSC (differential scanning calorimetry), CHN (elemental analysis), SEM&#8208;EDX (scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy) and tensiometry. According to the results with the increasing polymer concentration the colloidal stability of the tested systems also increases. Moreover, the addition of the surfactants causes the increase of polysaccharide adsorption but the colloidal stability of the tested systems decreases due to large weights of formed aggregates. As follows from the thermal analysis, the comparison of the TG/DTG&#8208;DSC curves obtained for the investigated polymers confirms that their thermal decomposition courses have some common features. The obtained results have the application potential in the formation of the materials for the pollutants removal from water and sewages.

         <title>Unveiling the Potential of Heterogeneous Catalysts for Molecular Solar Thermal Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing compounds that store and release solar energy is crucial for overcoming its intermittent nature. In Molecular Solar Thermal (MOST) systems, a high&#8208;energy photoisomer captures and releases energy. While photoisomerization is well&#8208;studied, back&#8208;conversion using catalysts is underexplored. We compare 27 catalysts in a Norbornadiene/Quadricyclane MOST system, offering insights for effective catalyst development and testing, highlighting the efficiency of Pt based heterogenous catalyst.







Abstract
Solar energy utilization has gained considerable attention due to its abundance and renewability. However, its intermittent nature presents a challenge in harnessing its full potential. The development of energy storing compounds capable of capturing and releasing solar energy on demand has emerged as a potential solution. These compounds undergo a photochemical transformation that results in a high&#8208;energy metastable photoisomer, which stores solar energy in the form of chemical bonds and can release it as heat when required. Such systems are referred to as MOlecular Solar Thermal (MOST)&#8208;systems. Although the photoisomerization of MOST systems has been vastly studied, its back&#8208;conversion, particularly using heterogeneous catalysts, is still underexplored and the development of effective catalysts for releasing stored energy is crucial. Herein we compare the performance of 27 heterogeneous catalysts releasing the stored energy in an efficient Norbornadiene/Quadricyclane (NBD/QC) MOST system. We report the first benchmarking of heterogeneous catalysts for a MOST system using a robust comparison method of the catalysts&#8217; activity and monitoring the conversion using UV&#8208;Visible (UV&#8208;Vis) spectroscopy. Our findings provide insights into the development of effective catalysts for MOST systems. We anticipate that our assay will reveal the necessity of further investigation on heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Influence of Crystallographic Structure and Metal Vacancies on the Oxygen Evolution Reaction Performance of Ni&#8208;based Layered Hydroxides
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#945;&#8208;layered hydroxide (LH) phase with Ni vacancies is the most electroactive catalyst among LH structures containing exclusively Ni(II).







Abstract
Nickel&#8208;based layered hydroxides (LHs) are a family of efficient electrocatalysts for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Nevertheless, fundamental aspects such as the influence of the crystalline structure and the role of lattice distortion of the catalytic sites remain poorly understood and typically muddled.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) confirm that the presence of Ni&#8208;vacancies produces acute distortions of the electroactive Ni sites (reflected as the shortening of the Ni&#8722;O distances and changes in the O&#8722;Ni&#8722;O angles), triggering the appearance of Ni localised electronic states on the Fermi level, reducing the Egap, and consequently, increasing the reactivity of the electroactive sites in the &#593;&#8208;LH structure. Furthermore, post&#8208;mortem Raman and XAS measurements unveil its transformation into a highly reactive oxyhydroxide&#8208;like phase that remains stable under ambient conditions. Hence, this work pinpoints the critical role of the crystalline structure as well as the electronic properties of LH structures on their inherent electrochemical reactivity towards OER catalysis. We envision Ni&#8208;based &#593;&#8208;LH as a perfect platform for hosting trivalent cations, closing the gap toward the next generation of benchmark efficient earth&#8208;abundant electrocatalysts.

&lt;p&gt;Nickel-based layered hydroxides (LHs) are a family of efficient electrocatalysts for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Nevertheless, fundamental aspects such as the influence of the crystalline structure and the role of lattice distortion of the catalytic sites remain poorly understood and typically muddled. Herein, we carried out a comprehensive investigation on &#593;-LH, &#946;-LH and layered double hydroxide (LDH) phases by means of structural, spectroscopical, &lt;i&gt;in-silico&lt;/i&gt; and electrochemical studies, which suggest the key aspect exerted by Ni-vacancies in the &#593;-LH structure. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) confirm that the presence of Ni-vacancies produces acute distortions of the electroactive Ni sites (reflected as the shortening of the Ni&#8722;O distances and changes in the O&#8722;Ni&#8722;O angles), triggering the appearance of Ni localised electronic states on the Fermi level, reducing the Egap, and consequently, increasing the reactivity of the electroactive sites in the &#593;-LH structure.

         <title>Collective Effects of Multiple Fluorine Atoms Causing &#960;&#8208;philic Characteristic within a Caged Polyoxometalate Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The polyanionic Mo132O372 architecture with perfluorinated interior surface favors capturing small non&#8208;aromatic guests carrying &#960;&#8208;bonds in water, which contrasts to the behavior of the non&#8208;fluorinated counterparts. Through systematic and control studies, it is revealed that collective effects of multiple C&#8722;F bonds, rather than the polarity of the individual C&#8722;F bonds, are responsible for the facile guest encapsulation.







Abstract
Perfluorination brings about distinctive properties arising from the unusual nature of the F element, which have been extensively developed in materials science and chemistry. Herein we report that the construction of F&#8208;rich inner space within a hollowed Mo132O372 cage ([Mo132O372(OCOR)30(H2O)72]42&#8722;) leads to the emergence of unique guest binding activities in encapsulation. Prominently, the trifluoroacetate&#8208;modified cage (R=CF3, 2) having as many as 90 F groups inside favors trapping cyclopentadiene (Cp), which is hardly trapped by the non&#8208;fluorinated counterpart (R=CH3, 1). Systematic studies using related hydrocarbons show that the amount of the encapsulated guest is correlated with the unsaturation degree of the guests, implying the involvement of the attractive interaction of the CF3&#8208;modified interior wall with the guest &#960;&#8208;electron clouds. Control experiments using the semi&#8208;fluorinated analogues (R=CF2H, CFH2) reveal that the perfluorination is a critical factor to facilitate the Cp encapsulation by 2, indicating that collective effects of polar C&#8722;F bonds spreading over the interior surface, rather than the polarity of the individual C&#8722;F bonds, are responsible. We also provide a successful example of the physical molecular confinement within the cage through the &#8220;ship&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;bottle&#8221; Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between trapped diene and dienophile.

         <title>Elucidating the Electronic Nature of Rh&#8208;based Paddlewheel Catalysts from 103Rh NMR Chemical Shifts: Insights from Quantum Mechanical Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For heteroleptic dirhodium paddlewheel complexes, the NMR shifts of the two chemically different Rh are more than 1000&#8197;ppm apart. In line with symmetry considerations, the shielding tensor responds only to the donor ability of the equatorial ligands along the perpendicular principal axis. Axial ligands, in contrast, have no direct effect on shielding but may come into play via the electronic cis&#8208;effect onto the neighboring equatorial sites.







Abstract
The tremendous importance of dirhodium paddlewheel complexes for asymmetric catalysis is largely the result of an empirical optimization of the chiral ligand sphere about the bimetallic core. It was only recently that a H(C)Rh triple resonance 103Rh NMR experiment provided the long&#8208;awaited opportunity to examine &#8211; with previously inconceivable accuracy &#8211; how variation of the ligands impacts on the electronic structure of such catalysts. The recorded effects are dramatic: formal replacement of only one out of eight O&#8208;atoms surrounding the metal centers in a dirhodium tetracarboxylate by an N&#8208;atom results in a shielding of the corresponding Rh&#8208;site of no less than 1000&#8197;ppm. The current paper provides the theoretical framework that allows this and related experimental observations made with a set of 19 representative rhodium complexes to be interpreted. In line with symmetry considerations, it is shown that the shielding tensor responds only to the donor ability of the equatorial ligands along the perpendicular principal axis. Axial ligands, in contrast, have no direct effect on shielding but may come into play via the electronic 
&#8208;effect that they exert onto the neighboring equatorial sites. On top of these fundamental interactions, charge redistribution within the core as well as the electronic 
&#8208;effect of ligands of different donor strengths is reflected in the recorded 103Rh NMR shifts.

         <title>Stabilization of sp&#8208;Hybridized Nitrogen Cation by Lewis Acid&#8208;Base Complex Formation with Intramolecular Iodine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anchimeric interaction with an sp&#8208;hybridized nitrogen cation with iodine affords an isolable acid&#8208;base complex. The N&#8722;I bonding is non&#8208;covalent but rather strong, while the O&#8722;I bond of the ligand is ionic and weak, facilitating ligand exchange in the presence of a Br&#248;nsted acid. The generated I+ cation species can be employed for &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation of ketones.







Abstract
Here we show that the sp&#8208;hybridized nitrogen cation is strongly stabilized by a peri&#8208;iodine substituent in the tetralone system. The cation is captured by anionic species such as CF3CO2&#8722;, affording hypervalent iodine(III) compounds with a short nitrogen&#8208;iodine (N&#8722;I) bond, in which the cation serves as a Lewis acid. Notably, the O&#8722;I bond of the O&#8208;trifluoroacetate or O&#8208;acetate is intrinsically weaker than the N&#8722;I bond due to its more ionic character and is further weakened by protonation in trifluoroacetic acid. As a result, the oxygen ligand can dissociate in the presence of a Br&#248;nsted acid, affording a I+ cation intermediate that retains the N&#8722;I bond. We isolated the cation as the tetrafluoroborate, and characterized it experimentally by 1H NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray structure analysis, and theoretically by means of DFT calculation. The results suggest that the N&#8722;I bonded cation is intrinsically stable, and is weakly coordinated with water and the BF4 counter anion or trifluoroacetate anion. This cation can be employed as a reagent for &#945;&#8208;oxidation of ketones.

         <title>Collective Synthesis of Sarpagine and Macroline Alkaloid&#8208;Inspired Compounds</title>

A compound collection inspired by both biology&#8208;oriented synthesis and pseudo&#8208;natural product design concepts was rapidly accessed by divergent synthesis. Biological evaluation revealed compounds derived from different design principles have different bioactivity profiles.







Abstract
Design strategies that can access natural&#8208;product&#8208;like chemical space in an efficient manner may facilitate the discovery of biologically relevant compounds. We have employed a divergent intermediate strategy to construct an indole alkaloid&#8208;inspired compound collection derived from two different molecular design principles, i.e. biology&#8208;oriented synthesis and pseudo&#8208;natural products. The divergent intermediate was subjected to acid&#8208;catalyzed or newly discovered Sn&#8208;mediated conditions to selectively promote intramolecular C&#8208; or N&#8208;acylation, respectively. After further derivatization, a collection totalling 84&#8197;compounds representing four classes was obtained. Morphological profiling via the cell painting assay coupled with a subprofile analysis showed that compounds derived from different design principles have different bioactivity profiles. The subprofile analysis suggested that a pseudo&#8208;natural product class is enriched in modulators of tubulin, and subsequent assays led to the identification of compounds that suppress in&#8197;vitro tubulin polymerization and mitotic progression.

&lt;p&gt;Design strategies that can access natural-product-like chemical space in an efficient manner may facilitate the discovery of biologically relevant compounds. We have employed a divergent intermediate strategy to construct an indole alkaloid-inspired compound collection derived from two different molecular design principles, i.e. biology-oriented synthesis and pseudo-natural products. The divergent intermediate was subjected to acid-catalyzed or newly discovered Sn-mediated conditions to selectively promote intramolecular &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;- or &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acylation, respectively. After further derivatization, a collection totalling 84&#8197;compounds representing four classes was obtained. Morphological profiling via the cell painting assay coupled with a subprofile analysis showed that compounds derived from different design principles have different bioactivity profiles. The subprofile analysis suggested that a pseudo-natural product class is enriched in modulators of tubulin, and subsequent assays led to the identification of compounds that suppress &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt; tubulin polymerization and mitotic progression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fluorescent Phenotyping of Blood Cells Using a Differential Sensing Strategy: Differentiating Physiological Aging Stages and Neuro&#8208;Degenerative Disease Drugs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A differential sensing approach is demonstrated to distinguish distinct aging status of mouse using TCF probes. Despite there is no reliable CD markers selective for aging progress, cross&#8208;reactivity of TCF probes generates unique fingerprint of aging by blood cell analysis.







Abstract
Blood continually contributes to the maintenance of homeostasis of the body and contains information regarding the health state of an individual. However, current hematological analyses predominantly rely on a limited number of CD markers and morphological analysis. In this work, differentially sensitive fluorescent compounds based on TCF scaffolds are introduced that are designed for fluorescent phenotyping of blood. Depending on their structures, TCF compounds displayed varied responses to reactive oxygen species, biothiols, redox&#8208;related biomolecules, and hemoglobin, which are the primary influential factors within blood. Contrary to conventional CD marker&#8208;based analysis, this unbiased fluorescent phenotyping method produces diverse fingerprints of the health state. Precise discrimination of blood samples from 37&#8197;mice was demonstrated based on their developmental stages, ranging from 10 to 19&#8197;weeks of age. Additionally, this fluorescent phenotyping method enabled the differentiation between drugs with distinct targets, serving as a simple yet potent tool for pharmacological analysis to understand the mode of action of various drugs.

         <title>An Indacenopicene&#8208;based Buckybowl Catcher for Recognition of Fullerenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel buckybowl catcher with an extended &#960;&#8208;surface has been synthesized by cross&#8208;coupling two bowl&#8208;shaped bromoindacenopicene moieties with a tolyl linker. The resulting binding values show a higher affinity of the catcher towards C70 over C60. The designed catcher demonstrated the fundamental possibility of creating sensors for spherical aromaticity. The catcher carefully framing the C70 fullerene is visualized as a miraculous, marvelous Faberg&#233; artwork. More information can be found in the Research Article by A.&#8197;S. Oshchepkov, K.&#8197;Y. Amsharov, M.&#8197;E. P&#233;rez&#8208;Ojeda et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302778).

         <title>Hierarchically Porous Covalent Organic Frameworks: Synthesis Methods and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high porosity have garnered considerable interest for various applications owing to their robust and customizable structure. However, conventional COFs are hindered by their narrow pore size, which poses limitations for applications such as heterogeneous catalysis and guest delivery that typically involve large molecules. The development of hierarchically porous COF (HP&#8208;COF), featuring a multi&#8208;scale aperture distribution, offers a promising solution by significantly enhancing the diffusion capacity and mass transfer for larger molecules. This review focuses on the recent advances in the synthesis strategies of HP&#8208;COF materials, including topological structure design, in&#8208;situ templating, monolithic COF synthesis, defect engineering, and crystalline self&#8208;transformation. The specific operational principles and affecting factors in the synthesis process are summarized and discussed, along with the applications of HP&#8208;COFs in heterogeneous catalysis, toxic component treatment, optoelectronics, and the biomedical field. Overall, this review builds a bridge to understand HP&#8208;COFs and provides guidance for further development of them on synthesis strategies and applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Skeletal Editing through Molecular Recombination of 2H&#8208;Indazoles to Azo&#8208;Linked&#8208;Quinazolinones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new protocol by the combinatory use of two equivalent of indazoles starting material with one being the carbon source via its C3&#8208;reactivity and the other, the coupling partner has been developed for the selectfluor&#8208;mediated single atom skeletal editing of 2H&#8208;indazoles. The azo&#8208;linked&#8208;2,3&#8208;disubstituted quinazolin&#8208;4&#8208;one derivatives were obtained through a carbon atom insertion between the two nitrogens of the indazole ring and simultaneous oxidation at C3 position of both inzadole moieties. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the amidic carbonyl oxygen of the product is derived from water and the reaction proceeds through in&#8208;situ generated N&#8208;centred indazolone radical intermediate.</dc:description>

The azo-linked-2,3-disubstituted quinazolin-4-one derivatives were obtained through a carbon atom insertion between the two nitrogens of the indazole ring and simultaneous oxidation at C3 position of both inzadole moieties. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the amidic carbonyl oxygen of the product is derived from water and the reaction proceeds through in-situ generated N-centred indazolone radical intermediate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Discovery of Unusual Ajmaline&#8208;Macroline Type Bisindole Alkaloids from Alstonia macrophylla by Building Blocks&#8208;Based Molecular Networking</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three unusual ajmaline&#8208;macroline type bisindole alkaloids, alsmaphylines A&#8722;C, together with their postulated biogenetic precursors, were isolated from the stem barks and leaves of&#160;Alstonia macrophylla via the building blocks&#8208;based molecular network (BBMN) strategy. Alsmaphyline A represents&#160;a rare ajmaline&#8208;macroline type bisindole alkaloid with an S&#8208;shape polycyclic ring system. Alsmaphylines B and C are two novel ajmaline&#8208;macroline type bisindole alkaloids with N&#8208;1&#8722;C&#8208;21'&#160;linkages, and the former possesses an unconventional stacked conformation due to the presence of intramolecular noncovalent interactions. The chemical structures including absolute configurations of alsmaphylines A&#8722;C were established by&#160;comprehensive spectroscopic analyses,&#160;electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculations, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. In addition, a plausible biosynthetic pathway&#160;of these bisindole alkaloids as well as their ability to promote the protein synthesis on HT22 cells were discussed.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A non&#8208;solvated alkyl&#8208;substituted Al(I) anion dimer was synthesized by a reduction of haloalumane precursor using a mechanochemical method. The crystallographic and theoretical analysis revealed its structure and electronic properties. Experimental XPS analysis of the Al(I) anions with reference compounds revealed the lower Al 2p binding energy corresponds to the lower oxidation state of Al species. It should be emphasized that the experimentally obtained XPS binding energies were reproduced by delta SCF calculations and were linearly correlated with NPA charges and 2p orbital energies.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic and Thermodynamic Control of Supramolecular Aggregation of Near Infrared Pyrrolopyrrole Cyanine Fluorophores Confined in Colloidal Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Control of the intermolecular aggregation of organic &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules as chromophores is crucial for tuning their physical properties such as light absorption/emission, and energy and charge transfer. Lots of advances have been achieved in control of intermolecular aggregation of organic chromophores in solid states where an indefinitely large number of molecules are involved. However, much less understanding has been gained at a mesoscale of aggregates formed by well&#8208;defined organization of a deterministic number of chromophores, which has been realized in natural photosynthetic systems but still remains rare in manmade materials. Here, we report both the kinetic and the thermodynamic control of the supramolecular aggregation of a near&#8208;infrared cyanine dye, PPcy, and its derivatives confined in colloidal nanoparticles stabilized by surfactants in aqueous media. Our results demonstrate that both the aggregation number, the aggregation state and the optical properties of the PPcy chromophores are controllable through optimization of the alkyl and polymer chains tethered from PPcy, the effective concentration of the chromophore inside each particle, and the surfactants utilized to stabilize the colloids in water.</dc:description>

         <title>Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction Using Palladium Catalysts Supported on Phosphine Periodic Mesoporous Organosilica</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphine periodic mesoporous organosilicas (R&#8208;P&#8208;PMO&#8208;TMS: R = Ph, tBu), which possess electron&#8208;donating alkyl substituents on the phosphorus atom, were synthesized using bifunctional compounds with alkoxysilyl&#8208; and phosphino groups, bis[3&#8208;(triethoxysilyl)propyl]phenylphosphine borane (1a) and bis[3&#8208;(triethoxysilyl)propyl]&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphine borane (1b). Immobilization of Pd(0) species was performed to give R&#8208;P&#8208;Pd&#8208;PMO&#8208;TMS: R = Ph (2a), tBu (3a), respectively. The Pd(0) immobilized 2a and 3a were applicable as catalysts for Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions of aryl chlorides with phenylboronic acid. It was revealed that 3a bearing more electron&#8208;donating tBu groups exhibited higher catalytic activity. Various functional groups including both electron withdrawing and donating substituents were compatible in the system. The recyclability of 3a was examined to support its moderate utility for the recycle use.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorinated Polymer Donors for Nonfullerene Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid development of narrow&#8208;bandgap non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) has boosted the efficiency of organic solar cells over 19%. The new features of high&#8208;performance NFAs, such as visible&#8208;NIR light absorption, moderate HOMO, and high crystallinity, require polymer donors with matching physical properties. This emphasizes the importance of methods that can effectively tune the physical properties of polymers. Owning to very small atom size and strongest electronegativity, the fluorination has been proved the most efficient strategy to regulate the physical properties of polymer donors, including frontier energy level, absorption coefficient, dielectric constant, crystallinity and charge transport. Owing to the success of fluorination strategy, the vast majority of high&#8208;performance polymer donors possess one or more fluorine atoms. In this review, the fluorination synthetic methods, the synthetic route of well&#8208;known fluorinated building blocks, the fluorinated polymers which are categorized by the type of donor or acceptor units, and the relationships between the polymer structures, properties, and photovoltaic performances are comprehensively surveyed. We hope this review could provide the readers a deeper insight into fluorination strategy and lay a strong foundation for future innovation of fluorinated polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Detecting protein&#8208;ligand interactions with nitroxide based paramagnetic cosolutes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NMR spectroscopy techniques can provide important information about protein&#8208;ligand interactions. Here we tested an NMR approach which relies on the measurement of paramagnetic relaxation enhancements (PREs) arising from analogous cationic, anionic or neutral soluble nitroxide molecules, which distribute around the protein&#8208;ligand complex depending on near&#8208;surface electrostatic potentials. We applied this approach to two protein&#8208;ligand systems, interleukin&#8208;8 interacting with highly charged glycosaminoglycans and the SH2 domain of Grb2 interacting with less charged phospho&#8208;tyrosine tripeptides. The electrostatic potential around interleukin&#8208;8 and its changes upon binding of glycosaminoglycans could be derived from the PRE data and confirmed by theoretical predictions from Poisson&#8208;Boltzmann calculations. The ligand influence on the PREs and NMR&#8208;derived electrostatic potentials of Grb2 SH2 was localized to a narrow protein region which allowed the localization of the peptide binding pocket. Our analysis suggests that experiments with nitroxide cosolutes can be useful for investigating protein&#8208;ligand electrostatic interactions and mapping ligand binding sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Dehydrogenative Electrochemical Synthesis of N&#8208;Aryl&#8208;3,4&#8208;Dihydroquinolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones by Iodine(III)&#8208;Mediated Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemically generated hypervalent iodine(III) species are powerful reagents for oxidative C&#8208;N coupling reactions, providing access to valuable N&#8208;heterocycles. A new electrocatalytic hypervalent iodine(III)&#8208;mediated in&#8208;cell synthesis of 1H&#8208;N&#8208;aryl&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroquinolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones by dehydrogenative C&#8208;N bond formation is presented. Catalytic amounts of the redox mediator, a low supporting electrolyte concentration and recycling of the solvent used make this method a sustainable alternative to electrochemical ex&#8208;cell or conventional approaches. Furthermore, inexpensive, readily available electrode materials and a simple galvanostatic set&#8208;up are applied. The broad functional group tolerance could be demonstrated by synthesizing 23 examples in yields up to 96%, with one reaction being performed on a 10&#8208;fold higher scale. Based on the obtained results a sound reaction mechanism could be proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;mediated N&#8208;Trifluoromethylation of O&#8209;Benzoylhydroxylamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of trifluoromethyl containing compounds is well established within medicinal chemistry, with a range of approved drugs containing C&#8208;CF3 and O&#8208;CF3 moieties. However, the utilisation of the N&#8209;CF3 functional group remains relatively unexplored. This may be attributed to the challenging synthesis of this unit, with many current methods employing harsh conditions or less accessible reagents. A robust methodology for the N&#8208;trifluoromethylation of secondary amines has been developed, which employs an umpolung strategy in the form of a copper&#8209;catalysed electrophilic amination. The method is operationally simple, uses mild, inexpensive reagents, and has been used to synthesise a range of novel, structurally complex N&#8208;CF3 containing compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Mediated Amination of Pyrogallol&#8208;Based Polyphenols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flavonoids are known to covalently modify amyloidogenic peptides by amination reactions. The underlying coupling process between polyphenols and N&#8208;nucleophiles is assessed by several in vitro and in silico approaches. The coupling reaction involves a sequence of oxidative dearomatization, amination, and reductive amination (ODARA) reaction steps. The C6&#8208;regioselectivity of the product is confirmed by crystallographic analysis. Under aqueous conditions, the reaction of baicalein with lysine derivatives yields C&#8208;N coupling as well as hydrolysis products of transient imine intermediates. The observed C&#8208;N coupling reactions work best for flavonoids combining a pyrogallol substructure with an electron&#8208;withdrawing group attached to the C4a&#8208;position. Thermodynamic properties such as bond dissociation energies also highlight the key role of pyrogallol units for the antioxidant ability. Combining the computed electronic properties and in vitro antioxidant assays suggests that the studied pyrogallol&#8208;containing flavonoids act by various radical&#8208;scavenging mechanisms working in synergy. Multivariate analysis indicates that a small number of descriptors for transient intermediates of the ODARA process generates a model with excellent performance (r=0.93) for the prediction of cross&#8208;coupling yields. The same model has been employed to predict novel antioxidant flavonoid&#8208;based molecules are considered as potential covalent inhibitors, opening a new avenue to the design of therapeutically relevant anti&#8208;amyloid compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Multifunctional Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have recently drawn intense attention due to their potential applications in photocatalysis. Herein, we report a multifunctional COF which consists of triphenylamine (TPA) and 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (2, 2&#8217;&#8208;bipy) entities. The obtained TAPA&#8208;BPy&#8208;COF is a heterogeneous photocatalyst and can efficiently catalyze the oxidative coupling of thiols to disulfides. In addition, TAPA&#8208;BPy&#8208;COF can be further metalated by Pd(II) via 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipy&#8208;metal coordination. The generated Pd@TAPA&#8208;BPy&#8208;COF can highly promote photocatalytic synthesis of 3&#8208;cyanopyridines via cascade addition/cyclization of arylboronic acids with &#947;&#8208;ketodinitriles in heterogeneous way. This work has demonstrated the way for the rational design and preparation of more efficient photoactive COFs for photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We use MOFs material as precursor to synthesize carbon based two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials loaded with In&#8208;S&#8208;O nanoparticles. The In&#8208;S&#8208;O nanoparticles have exhibited Janus architecture composed of two compounds with different crystal structures that are combined in&#8208;plane on two&#8208;dimensional carbon material surface. The excellent properties of this in&#8208;plane Janus material include 2D nanoarchitecture and its Janus properties formed by combining two different crystal structures. It has exhibited excellent electrochemical performances due to its abundant electrochemical active sites and large specific surface area. According to experiments, the electron transfer number of the material for two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction is about 2.4, and the hydrogen peroxide yield is 32 mg /h cm2. In the further &#160;test of liquid flow electrolytic cell, the yield can reach up to 172 mg /h cm2</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;Based Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Sheet&#8208;Like Supramolecular Metallohydrogel Organized by Using a Native Ultrashort Peptide Sequence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing supramolecular hydrogels using short peptides is challenging. To control self&#8208;assembly, a certain amount of organic solvent is typically added to the system, or the short peptide is modified with a functional group that is hydrophobic, hydrophilic, or highly coordinative. We discovered that l&#8208;His&#8208;l&#8208;Ile&#8208;l&#8208;Thr (HIT), a very short unmodified &#8220;native&#8221; tripeptide, selectively responds to Cu2+ ions in pure water to form a transparent supramolecular metallohydrogel. Circular dichroism analysis revealed that Cu2+ ions, but no other metal species, caused HIT to change from a random&#8208;coil&#8208;like to a &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;like structure. Other spectroscopic methods were used to characterize the properties of the supramolecular metallohydrogel. These results are expected to facilitate the development of native short peptides as advanced functional biomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>New Multifunctional Bipyrimidine&#8208;Based Chromophores for NLO&#8208;Active Thin&#8208;Film Preparation
</title>

         <dc:description>
Herein, the preparation of bipyrimidine&#8208;based chromophores presenting alkoxystyryl donor groups carrying aliphatic achiral and chiral chains on the 4 position is described. Symmetry breaking by judicious functionalization of 3D organic octupoles allows the emergence of multifunctional liquid crystalline or crystalline chromophores, which can easily be processed into large, flexible, thin and self&#8208;oriented films presenting second harmonic generation response.







Abstract
New synthesized bipyrimidine&#8208;based chromophores presenting alkoxystyryl donor groups carrying aliphatic achiral and chiral chains in the 4 position, connected to electron&#8208;accepting 2,2&#8208;bipyrimidine cores have been synthesized. Their linear and nonlinear optical (NLO) properties were investigated as well as their mesomorphic properties by various techniques (light&#8208;transmission measurements, polarized&#8208;light optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry measurements and two&#8208;photon excited fluorescence). The derivatives with achiral linear carbon chains were found to exhibit liquid&#8208;crystal properties with the formation smectic phases over large temperature ranges, which were confirmed by small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering analysis via stacking models. The nonlinear optical properties in the solid state for derivatives with C14 and the citronellol chains have been studied by wide&#8208;field second&#8208;harmonic generation and multi&#8208;photon fluorescence imaging, confirming centrosymmetry for these achiral mesogens and their excellent third&#8208;order nonlinearity whereas the chiral compound exhibits non&#8208;centrosymmetric organization resulting in a strong Second Harmonic Generation at the crystal state.

A new series of unsymmetrical phenyl tellurides derived from 2&#8208;N&#8208;(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)benzamide has been synthesized by copper&#8208;catalyzed method using diaryl ditelluride. Further, monotellurides were converted into corresponding tellurium cations. Next, these Lewis acidic tellurium cations were used as catalysts to synthesize 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines from anilines and highly regioselective creation of &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols from epoxides.







Abstract
A new series of unsymmetrical phenyl tellurides derived from 2&#8208;N&#8208;(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl) benzamide ligand has been synthesized in a practical manner by the copper&#8208;catalyzed method by using diaryl ditelluride and Mg as a reductant at room temperature. In order to augment the Lewis acidity of these newly formed unsymmetrical monotellurides, these have been transformed into corresponding unsymmetrical 2&#8208;N&#8208;(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)benzamide tellurium cations. Subsequently, these Lewis acidic tellurium cations were used as chalcogen bonding catalysts, enabling the synthesis of various substituted 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines by activating ketones with anilines under mild conditions. Moreover, the synthesized 2&#8208;N&#8208;(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)benzamide phenyl tellurium cation has also catalyzed the formation of &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols in high regioselectivity by effectively activating epoxides at room temperature. Mechanistic insight by 1H and 19F NMR study, electrostatic surface potential (ESP map), control reaction in which tellurium cation reacted explosively with epoxide, suggested that the enhanced Lewis acidity of tellurium center seems responsible for efficient catalytic activities under mild conditions enabling &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols with excellent regioselectivity and 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines with trifluoromethyl, nitro, and pyridylsubstitution, which were difficult to access.

         <title>Cyano Decoration of &#960;&#8208;Bridge to Boost Photoluminescence and Electroluminescence Quantum Yields of Triazine/Carbazole Based Blue TADF Emitter</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating less bulky cyano group to replace methyl on &#960; bridge of donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor molecule instead strengthened the thermally activated delayed fluorescence feature through enhancing intramolecular charge transfer, and boosted photoluminescence quantum yield from 40&#8201;% to 94&#8201;% by increasing HOMO&#8208;LUMO overlap, finally led to an EQE of 14&#8201;% in blue OLED.







Abstract
In general, a large donor&#8208;acceptor dihedral angle is required to guarantee sufficient frontier molecular orbitals separation for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters, which is intrinsically unfavorable for the radiative transition. We present a molecular design method favoring both reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) and radiative transitions even at a moderate D&#8722;A angle. A blue TADF emitter TrzBuCz&#8208;CN was designed with triazine/tert&#8208;butylcarbazole as donor/acceptor and cyano (CN) incorporated on the phenylene bridge. In comparison with the methyl decoration in similar way (TrzBuCz&#8722;Me), CN decoration reduced the D&#8722;A dihedral angle from 70&#176; to 60&#176;, which is intrinsically not favorable for sufficient FMO separation, but unexpectedly reduced the singlet and triplet energy gap (&#916;EST) and thus facilitated TADF feature by pulling down the lowest singlet state energy. While the reduced distorsion instead improved the HOMO&#8208;LUMO overlap and boosted the fluorescence quantum yield from 41&#8201;% to 94&#8201;%. The blue organic light&#8208;emitting diode of TrzBuCz&#8208;CN exhibited an external quantum efficiency of 13.7&#8201;% with emission peak at 466&#8197;nm, greatly superior to 6.0&#8201;% of TrzBuCz&#8722;Me. The result provides a feasible design strategy to facilitate both RISC and radiation processes by CN decoration of the linking bridge of TADF emitters.

         <title>Deciphering Iron&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Amination with Organic Azides: N2 Cleavage from a Stable Organoazide Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elucidating the mechanism of C&#8722;H amination with organic azides: a stable iron &#945;&#8208;N coordinated organoazide complex that is in fast equilibrium between the free and coordinated state undergoes gradual N2 loss, demonstrated by NMR kinetics, M&#246;ssbauer measurements, photo&#8208;crystallography, and DFT calculations.







Abstract
Catalytic C&#8722;N bond formation by direct activation of C&#8722;H bonds offers wide synthetic potential. En route to C&#8722;H amination, complexes with organic azides are critical precursors towards the reactive nitrene intermediate. Despite their relevance, &#945;&#8208;N coordinated organoazide complexes are scarce in general, and elusive with iron, although iron complexes are by far the most active catalysts for C&#8722;H amination with organoazides. Herein, we report the synthesis of a stable iron &#945;&#8208;N coordinated organoazide complex from [Fe(N(SiMe3)2)2] and AdN3 (Ad=1&#8208;adamantyl) and its crystallographic, IR, NMR and zero&#8208;field 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopic characterization. These analyses revealed that the organoazide is in fast equilibrium between the free and coordinated state (Keq=62). Photo&#8208;crystallography experiments showed gradual dissociation of N2, which imparted an Fe&#8722;N bond shortening and correspond to structural snapshots of the formation of an iron imido/nitrene complex. Reactivity of the organoazide complex in solution showed complete loss of N2, and subsequent formation of a C&#8722;H aminated product via nitrene insertion into a C&#8722;H bond of the N(SiMe3)2 ligand. Monitoring this reaction by 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy indicates the transient formation of the imido/nitrene intermediate, which was supported by M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy in frozen solution.

         <title>Organic Photothermal Materials Obtained Using Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Design Principles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
There's a twist! Organic photothermal materials based on the anilino&#8208;naphthalenediimide (ANDI) acceptor are rationally designed using sterically hindered donors with a large dihedral angle to reduce radiative processes. The ANDI materials demonstrate near&#8208;infrared absorbance and high photothermal conversion efficiencies upon encapsulation into nanoparticles.







Abstract
Organic small molecules with high photothermal conversion efficiencies that absorb near&#8208;infrared light are desirable for photothermal therapy due to their improved biocompatibility compared to inorganic materials and their ability to absorb light in the biological transparency window (650&#8211;1350&#8197;nm). Here we report three donor&#8208;acceptor organic materials DM&#8208;ANDI, O&#8208;ANDI, and S&#8208;ANDI that show high photothermal conversion efficiencies of 46&#8211;68&#8201;% with near&#8208;infrared absorption. The design of these molecules is based on the rational modification of a thermally activated delayed fluorescence material to favour a low photoluminescence quantum yield by reducing HOMO&#8208;LUMO overlap. Encapsulating these materials into either neat nanoparticles or aggregated organic dots modulates their photothermal conversion efficiencies, and also facilitates dispersion in water.

         <title>Easy to Use DFT Approach for Computational pKa Determination of Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computational chemistry has an intrinsically green approach, as it gives us the possibility to predict molecular properties, such as the pKa, thereby avoiding time&#8208;consuming experiments. It combines the past of experimental chemistry with the future. In the cartoon, our DFT&#8208;based &#8220;easy&#8208;to&#8208;use&#8208;methodology&#8221; is shown. Note the accurate result in predicting the pKa values of trifluoro&#8208; and trichloroacetic acid, easily obtained by adding two water molecules at the reaction centre. More information can be found in the Research Article by F. Sabuzi and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303167).

Solid&#8208;state generation of diarylisonaphthofurans from 1,3&#8208;diaryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydronaphthofuranols is reported in this work. The generated reactive molecules were stable in the solid state and could be stored without any precaution. Furthermore, the mechanochemical Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of 1,3&#8208;diarylisonaphthofurans with epoxynaphthalenes afforded synthetically attractive diepoxypentacenes.

         <title>Barbier polymerization&#8208;induced emission&#160;towards fully substituted polyethylene analogues with non&#8208;traditional intrinsic luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The properties of polyethylene are highly dependent on the variety and quantity of substitutions. Generally, polyethylene can only be fully substituted with fluorine atoms mainly, e.g., polytetrafluoroethylene and nafion, because atomic radius of fluorine atom is small enough. The preparation of fully substituted polyethylene analogues (FSPEA) and their non&#8208;traditional intrinsic luminescence (NTIL) are attractive, especially for substitutions with relatively larger atomic radius than fluorine atom. Here, Barbier polymerization&#8208;induced emission (PIE) is demonstrated as a universal method for the molecular design of NTIL type FSPEAs with intriguing aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behaviors. Through Barbier polymerization of diphenyldichloromethane and different peroxyesters in the presence of Mg in one pot, a series of FSPEAs, including polytriphenylethanol (PTPE), polydiphenylfurylethanol (PDPFE), polydiphenylthiophenylethanol (PDPTE) and polydiphenylnaphthylethanol (PDPNE) have been successfully prepared. Further potential applications for explosive detection, artificial light&#8208;harvesting system and white phosphor&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diode are investigated. Therefore, this work opens up a new approach for the molecular design of FSPEA with non&#8208;conjugated luminescence, which may cause inspirations to different research fields like polyolefin and luminescent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Tumor Targeted Cuprous&#8208;Based Nanocomposite as Responsive Cascade Nanocatalyst for Efficient Tumor Synergistic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The single&#8208;functionality of traditional chemodynamic therapy (CDT) reagents usually limits the therapeutic efficacy of cancer treatment. Synergistic nanocomposites that involve cascade reaction provide a promising strategy to achieve satisfactory anticancer effects. Herein, a cuprous&#8208;based nanocomposite (CCS@GOx@HA) is fabricated, which owns the tumor targeting ability and can undergo tumor microenvironment responsive cascade reaction to enhance the tumor therapeutic efficiency significantly. Surface modification of nanocomposite with hyaluronic acid enables the targeted delivery of the nanocomposite to cancer cells. Acid&#8208;triggered decomposition of nanocomposite in cancer cell results in the release of Cu+, Se2&#8208; and GOx. The Cu+ improves the Fenton&#8208;like reaction with endogenous H2O2 to generate highly toxic &#8226;OH for CDT. While GOx can not only catalyze the in situ generation of endogenous H2O2, but also accelerate the consumption of intratumoral glucose to reduce nutrient supply in tumor site. In addition, Se2&#8208; further improves the therapeutic effects of CDT by upregulating the reactive oxygen species (ROS) in tumor cells. Meanwhile, the surface modification endows the nanocomposite the good water dispersibility and biocompatibility. Moreover, in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate satisfactory anti&#8208;cancer therapeutic performance by the synergistic cascade function of CCS@GOx@HA than CDT alone.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Anomaly of Reduction of Carborane&#8208;bis&#8208;silylene Stabilized Silylone/Germylone leading to Unusual Oxidation of Si0/Ge0 to SiI/GeI with EDA&#8208;NOCV Analyses</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Researchers have successfully isolated Si0/Ge0 species, termed silylone and germylone, with two lone pairs of electrons on them. These elusive compounds have been stabilized in singlet ground states using different donor base ligands. Driess et al. have particularly made strides in this area, isolating carborane&#8208;bis&#8208;silylene stabilized silylone/germylone and their N+/Pb analogues. Carborane (C2B10H10) plays a pivotal role as a redox&#8208;active ligand, converting from closo&#8208;carborane to nido&#8208;carborane with the addition of two electrons. Notably, anomalous oxidation of Si0/Ge0 centres in carborane&#8208;bis&#8208;silylene stabilized species to SiI/GeI has been reported, resulting in the formation of dimeric SiI&#8208;SiI/GeI&#8208;GeI dicationic units. This study of Energy decomposition analysis coupled with natural orbital for chemical valence (EDA&#8208;NOCV) focuses on the carborane&#8208;bis&#8208;silylene ligand in the free state, and its three other species, including silylone/germylone species. Interestingly, it reveals that the carborane unit in an anionic doublet state tends to form one electron&#8208;sharing bond and one dative bond with the counter fragment in its cationic doublet state. This helps us to rationalize why the carborane unit undergoes intramolecular electronic rearrangements leading to the formation of a dianionic carborane unit with a significantly elongated C&#8208;C bond (2.38&#8208;2.68 &#197;) and undergoing unusual oxidation of Si0/Ge0 to SiI/GeI</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Supramolecular Organogel Constructed Using Riboflavin and Melamine: Its Application in Photo&#8208;Catalyzed Colorimetric Chiral Sensing and Enantioselective Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of a chiral supramolecular organogel via the hierarchical helical self&#8208;assembly of optically active riboflavin and melamine derivatives is described herein. Owing to the photocatalysis of riboflavin and the supramolecular chirality induced in the helically stacked riboflavin/melamine complex, the gel is observed to act as a light&#8208;stimulated chiral sensor of optically active alcohols by detecting the change in color from yellow to green. The gel also served as an efficient chiral adsorbent, enabling optical resolution of a racemic compound with high chiral recognition ability.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 3&#8208;Phenylserine by a Two&#8208;enzyme Cascade System with PLP Cofactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A two&#8208;enzyme cascade system containing &#969;&#8208;transaminase (&#969;&#8208;TA) and L&#8208;threonine aldolase (L&#8208;ThA) was reported for the synthesis of 3&#8208;Phenylserine starting from benzylamine, and PLP was utilized as the only cofactor in these both two enzymes reaction system. Based on the transamination results, benzylamine was optimized as an advantageous amino donor as confirmed by MD simulation results. This cascade reaction system could not only facilitate the in situ removal of the co&#8208;product benzaldehyde, enhancing the economic viability of the reaction, but also establish a novel pathway for synthesizing high&#8208;value phenyl&#8208;serine derivatives. In our study, nearly 95% of benzylamine was converted, yielding over 54% of 3&#8208;Phenylserine under the optimized conditions cascade reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Trifluoromethylated Monoterpenes by an Engineered Cytochrome P450</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein engineering of cytochrome P450s has enabled these biocatalysts to promote a variety of abiotic reactions beyond nature's repertoire. Integrating such non&#8208;natural transformations with microbial biosynthetic pathways could allow sustainable enzymatic production of modified natural product derivatives. In particular, trifluoromethylation is a highly desirable modification in pharmaceutical research due to the positive effects of the trifluoromethyl group on drug potency, bioavailability, and metabolic stability. This study demonstrates the biosynthesis of non&#8208;natural trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted cyclopropane derivatives of natural monoterpene scaffolds using an engineered cytochrome P450 variant, P411&#8208;PFA. P411&#8208;PFA successfully catalyzed the transfer of a trifluoromethyl carbene from 2&#8208;diazo&#8208;1,1,1&#8208;trifluoroethane to the terminal alkenes of several monoterpenes, including L&#8208;carveol, carvone, perilla alcohol, and perillartine, to generate the corresponding trifluoromethylated cyclopropane products. Furthermore, integration of this abiotic cyclopropanation reaction with a reconstructed metabolic pathway for L&#8208;carveol production in Escherichia coli enabled one&#8208;step biosynthesis of a trifluoromethylated L&#8208;carveol derivative from limonene precursor. Overall, amalgamating synthetic enzymatic chemistry with established metabolic pathways represents a promising approach to sustainably produce bioactive natural product analogs.</dc:description>

         <title>Trifluoroethylation and Pentafluoropropylation of C(sp3)&#8211;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyfluorinated substituents often enhance effectiveness, improve the stability within metabolic processes, and boost the lipophilicity of biologically active compounds. However, methods for their introduction into aliphatic carbon chains remain very limited. A potentially general route to integrate the fluorinated scaffolds into organic molecules involves insertion of fluorine&#8208;containing carbenes into C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds. The electron&#8208;withdrawing characteristics of perfluoroalkyl groups enhances the reactivity of these carbenes which should enable the functionalization of unactivated C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds. Curiously, it appears that use of perfluoroalkyl&#8208;containing carbenes in alkane C&#8211;H functionalization is exceedingly rare. This concept describes photolysis, enzymatic catalysis, and transition metal catalysis as three primary approaches to C(sp3)&#8211;H functionalization by trifluoromethylcarbene and its homologues.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Hypervalent Iodine Diazo Compounds and Their Application in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aim of this review is to give an overview of diazomethyl&#8208;substituted iodine(III) compounds in synthesis and application.







Abstract
Diazomethyl&#8208;substituted iodine(III) compounds with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (EWG) connected to diazo methyl center were a type of donor&#8208;acceptor diazo compounds with potential reaction abilities similar to ordinary diazo compounds. Although several diazomethyl&#8208;substituted iodine(III) compounds were synthesized and used in the nucleophilic substitution reactions as early as 1994, the synthesis and application of new iodine(III) diazo compounds have only been reported to a certain extent in recent years. In the presence of rhodium catalyst, photocatalyst, or nucleophiles, diazomethyl&#8208;substituted iodine(III) compounds can be converted into rhodium&#8208;carbenes, diazomethyl radicals, ester radicals or nucleophilic intermediates, which can be used as key intermediates for the formation of chemical bonds. The aim of this review is to give an overview of diazomethyl&#8208;substituted iodine(III) compounds in organic synthesis.

         <title>Doubly Bridged Anthracenes: Blue Emitters for OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of bridged anthracenes was synthesized and their photostabilities were accessed. While the length of the bridges only plays a minor role, introduction of electron withdrawing ester&#8208;based linkers retards photooxidation most. Those esters bridged anthracenes could be prepared in reasonable yields and &#8220;proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle&#8221; organic light emitting diodes with deep blue emission were built, demonstrating their potential as emitters.







Abstract
The photooxidative stability of a series of doubly bridged anthracenes was evaluated after their preparation via twofold macrocyclization of a bis(resorcinyl)anthracene. Lightfastness correlates with the energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), resulting in superior stability of the tetraesters compared to the tetraethers. The lengths and steric demand of the linker only plays a minor role for the ester&#8208;based compounds, which can be prepared in reasonable yields and thus tested in proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. Double ester&#8208;bridging allows deep blue electro&#8208;luminescence, highlighting the importance of the choice of the functional groups used for macrocyclization.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A series of bridged anthracenes&lt;/b&gt; was synthesized and their photostabilities were accessed. While the length of the bridges only plays a minor role, introduction of electron withdrawing ester-based linkers retards photooxidation most. Those esters bridged anthracenes could be prepared in reasonable yields and &#8220;proof-of-principle&#8221; organic light emitting diodes with deep blue emission were built, demonstrating their potential as emitters.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photooxidative stability of a series of doubly bridged anthracenes was evaluated after their preparation &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; twofold macrocyclization of a bis(resorcinyl)anthracene. Lightfastness correlates with the energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), resulting in superior stability of the tetraesters compared to the tetraethers. The lengths and steric demand of the linker only plays a minor role for the ester-based compounds, which can be prepared in reasonable yields and thus tested in proof-of-concept organic light-emitting diodes. Double ester-bridging allows deep blue electro-luminescence, highlighting the importance of the choice of the functional groups used for macrocyclization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Confining Ionic Liquids in Developing Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progress and achievement of using IL&#8208;confinement in developing quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes for lithium metal batteries are surveyed, summarized, and analyzed, and the influence of specific parameters was discussed, indicating that the IL&#8208;confinement improves the performance of electrolytes, and the IL&#8208;confinement concept in the battery area is in a broad extent.







Abstract
The concept of confining ionic liquids (ILs) in developing quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes (QSSEs) has been proposed, where ILs are dispersed in polymer networks/backbones and/or filler/host pores, forming the so&#8208;called confinement, and great research progress and promising research results have been achieved. In this review, the progress and achievement in developing QSSEs using IL&#8208;confinement for lithium metal batteries (LMBs), together with advanced characterizations and simulations, were surveyed, summarized, and analyzed, where the influence of specific parameters, such as IL (type, content, etc.), substrate (type, structure, surface properties, etc.), confinement methods, and so on, was discussed. The confinement concept was further compared with the conventional one in other research areas. It indicates that the IL&#8208;confinement in QSSEs improves the performance of electrolytes, for example, increasing the ionic conductivity, widening the electrochemical window, and enhancing the cycle performance of the assembled cells, and being different from those in other areas, that is, the IL&#8208;confinement concept in the battery area is in a broad extent. Finally, insights into developing QSSEs in LMBs with the confinement strategy were provided to promote the development and application of QSSE LMBs.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Vibronic Coupling Controls the Intersystem Crossing of Iodine&#8208;Substituted BODIPY Triplet Chromophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
BODIPY dyes, extensively used as triplet chromophores, have unique electronic structure with strong interactions of spin, electronic and vibrational dynamics. In this experimental and computational study, we explain the control of intersystem crossing of BODIPY triplet chromophores by spin&#8208;vibronic coupling. We rationalize the site&#8208;specific effect of heavy atom substitution by extending El&#8208;Sayed rules beyond their traditional applications.







Abstract
4,4&#8208;Difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;borata&#8208;3a&#8208;azonia&#8208;4a&#8208;aza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene (BODIPY) dyes are extensively used in various applications of their triplet states, ranging from photoredox catalysis, through triplet sensitization to photodynamic therapy. However, the rational design of BODIPY triplet chromophores by ab initio modelling is limited by their strong interactions of spin, electronic and vibrational dynamics. In particular, spin&#8208;vibronic coupling is often overlooked when estimating intersystem crossing (ISC) rates. In this study, a combined experimental and theoretical approach using spin&#8208;vibronic coupling to correctly describe ISC in BODIPY dyes was developed. For this purpose, seven &#960;&#8208;extended BODIPY derivatives with iodine atoms in different positions were examined. It was found that the heavy&#8208;atom effect of iodine atoms is site specific, causing high triplet yields in only some positions. This site&#8208;specific ISC was explained by El&#8208;Sayed rules, so both the contribution and character of the molecular orbitals involved in the excitation must be considered when predicting the ISC rates. Overall, the rational design of BODIPY triplet chromophores requires using (i)&#8197;the high&#8208;quality electronic structure theory, including both static and dynamical correlations; and (ii)&#8197;the two&#8208;component wave function Hamiltonian, and rationalizing; and (iii)&#8197;ISC based on the character of the molecular orbitals of heavy atoms involved in the excitation, expanding El&#8208;Sayed rules beyond their traditional applications.

         <title>Glycerol Oligomerization over Titania&#8208;Based Catalyst Compositions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modification of TiO2 with sulfonic groups causes the appearance of catalytic activity with the formation of a wide range of polyglycerides. Fabrication of a composite of sulfated titania with carbon nanotubes limits the spectrum of products with short&#8208;chain linear glycerides. Thus, it gives a promising way to obtain a selective catalyst for the processing of glycerol into short&#8208;chain polyglycerides.







Abstract
The possibility of using TiO2&#8208;based compositions: individual and sulfated titania, and their composites with carbon nanotubes as catalysts for glycerol oligomerization has been displayed. The effect of modification of TiO2 with sulfur and carbon nanotubes on acid&#8208;base and catalytic characteristics in the glycerol conversion was investigated. The activation of glycerol on the catalysts has been studied using attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR&#8208;FTIR) spectroscopy. Only the samples based on sulfated titania are active over glycerol transformation, showing up to 58.7&#8201;% conversion. This is explained by the presence of strong base sites. Glycerides up to pentaglycerides, both linear and nonlinear structure are formed by glycerol oligomerization over TiO2&#8722;S. The addition of nanotubes to the catalyst reduces both the glycerol conversion (up to 10.5&#8201;%) and the yield of glycerides. However, the spectrum of the resulting products is significantly narrowed, increasing the selectivity for short&#8208;chain glycerides: the portion of diglycerides reaches 72&#8201;%, and triglycerides 21&#8201;%. Herewith, glycerides of a linear structure only formed.

         <title>Robust Spin Liquidity in 2D Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Cu3 (HHTP)2 with S=1/2 Kagome Lattice</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique synthetic approach is implemented to crystallize a Cu(II)&#8208;based 2D MOF, Cu3(HHTP)2 onto reduced graphene oxide (rGO) leading to electron doping via chemical interaction between two sublattices, magnetic and electronic, resulting in the 200&#8208;fold increase in electrical conductivity along with the presence of robust spin liquidity.







Abstract
On one hand electron or hole doping of quantum spin liquid (QSL) may unlock high&#8208;temperature superconductivity and on the other hand it can disrupt the spin liquidity, giving rise to a magnetically ordered ground state. Recently, a 2D MOF, Cu3(HHTP)2 (HHTP &#8208; 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene), containing Cu(II) S=
 frustrated spins in the Kagome lattice is emerging as a promising QSL candidate. Herein, we present an elegant in&#8197;situ redox&#8208;chemistry strategy of anchoring Cu3(HHTP)2 crystallites onto diamagnetic reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets, resulting in the formation of electron&#8208;doped Cu3(HHTP)2&#8208;rGO composite which exhibited a characteristic semiconducting behavior (5&#8197;K to 300&#8197;K) with high electrical conductivity of 70&#8197;S&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;m&#8722;1 and a carrier density of ~1.1&#215;1018&#8197;cm&#8722;3 at 300&#8197;K. Remarkably, no magnetic transition in the Cu3(HHTP)2&#8208;rGO composite was observed down to 1.5&#8197;K endorsing the robust spin liquidity of the 2D MOF Cu3(HHTP)2. Specific heat capacity measurements led to the estimation of the residual entropy values of 28&#8201;% and 34&#8201;% of the theoretically expected value for the pristine Cu3(HHTP)2 and Cu3(HHTP)2&#8208;rGO composite, establishing the presence of strong quantum fluctuations down to 1.5&#8197;K (two times smaller than the value of the exchange interaction J).

         <title>Synthesis and Evaluation of Glycosyl Luciferins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work highlights the synthesis of glycosyl luciferins and their potential for determining glycosidase activity. Two novel synthetic routes were developed that were used to introduce the luciferin moiety in a late&#8208;stage of the sequence and the linear range of the glycosidase assays and kinetics of the substrates were determined.







Abstract
Measuring glycosidase activity is important to monitor any aberrations in carbohydrate hydrolase activity, but also for the screening of potential glycosidase inhibitors. To this end, synthetic substrates are needed which provide an enzyme&#8208;dependent read&#8208;out upon hydrolysis by the glycosidase. Herein, we present two new routes for the synthesis of caged luminescent carbohydrates, which can be used for determining glycosidase activity with a luminescent reporter molecule. The substrates were validated with glycosidase and revealed a clear linear range and enzyme&#8208;dependent signal upon the in&#8197;situ generation of the luciferin moiety from the corresponding nitrile precursors. Besides, we showed that these compounds could directly be synthesized from unprotected glycosyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;fluorides in a two&#8208;step procedure with yields up to 75&#8201;%. The intermediate methyl imidate appeared a key intermediate which also reacted with d&#8208;cysteine to give the corresponding d&#8208;luciferin substrate rendering this a highly attractive method for synthesizing glycosyl luciferins in good yields.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Manganese (I)&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidant&#8208;Controlled Divergent Functionalization of 2&#8208;Arylindazoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we have reported a one&#8208;pot oxidant&#8208;controlled synthesis of C&#8208;2&#8242; formyl 2H&#8208;indazoles, along with two rare heterocycles viz. indazoloindazolediones and indazolobenzoxazines from 2&#8208;arylindazoles through Mn(I)&#8208;catalyzed ortho C&#8722;H functionalization followed by oxidation with varying the amount of DDQ and switching from DDQ to selectfluor, with broad range of substrates scope.







Abstract
The oxidant&#8208;controlled divergent synthesis of C&#8208;2&#8242; formyl 2H&#8208;indazoles and indazoloindazolediones has been developed through Mn(I)&#8208; catalyzed ortho C&#8722;H functionalization of 2H&#8208;indazoles with para&#8208;formaldehyde to afford C&#8208;2&#8242; hydroxymethylated 2H&#8208;indazoles and subsequently oxidation with varying the amount of DDQ in one&#8208;pot. By employing selectfluor as the oxidant instead of DDQ, this reaction exclusively provided indazolebenzoxazine derivatives. This strategy delivered unsymmetrical indazoloindazoledione and indazolobenzoxazine with varied functional group tolerance in moderate to good yields.

         <title>Porous Carbon Foam with Carbon Nanotubes as Cathode for Li&#8722;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous carbon foam with carbon nanotubes were elaborately designed and fabricated by using cobalt as the catalyst and utilized as cathode for Li&#8722;CO2 battery. The unique structure can enhance the decomposition rate of lithium carbonate, and thus improve the electrochemical performance of Li&#8722;CO2 battery.







Abstract
With the extensive use of fossil fuels, the ever&#8208;increasing greenhouse gas of mainly carbon dioxide emissions will result in global climate change. It is of utmost importance to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and its utilization. Li&#8722;CO2 batteries can convert carbon dioxide into electrochemical energy. However, developing efficient catalysts for the decomposition of Li2CO3 as the discharge product represents a challenge in Li&#8722;CO2 batteries. Herein, we demonstrate a carbon foam composite with growing carbon nanotube by using cobalt as the catalyst, showing the ability to enhance the decomposition rate of Li2CO3, and thus improve the electrochemical performance of Li&#8722;CO2 batteries. Benefiting from its abundant pore structure and catalytic sites, the as&#8208;assembled Li&#8722;CO2 battery exhibits a desirable overpotential of 1.67&#8197;V after 50&#8197;cycles. Moreover, the overpotentials are 1.05 and 2.38&#8197;V at current densities of 0.02 and 0.20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. These results provide a new avenue for the development of efficient catalysts for Li&#8722;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Binding Properties of Small Electrophilic Anions [B6X5]&#8722; and [B10X9]&#8722; (X=Cl, Br, I): Activation of Small Molecules Based on &#960;&#8208;Backbonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A special feature of the small metal&#8208;free electrophilic anion [B6X5]&#8722; is nitrogen activation through &#960;&#8208;backbonding. The &#960;&#8208;backbonding predicted by EDA ETS&#8208;NOCV and detected by IR spectroscopy as a red shift of the bound N2 vibrational frequency is shown as a cartoon &#8220;boxing match&#8221; between N2 (blue glove, &#963;&#8208;donation) and [B6Cl5]&#8208; (red gloves, &#960;&#8208;backdonation). The measured spectrum is shown on the outer surface of the boxing ring. Further information, including interaction with CO and H2O and comparison with [B12X11]&#8722;, can be found in the Research Article by J. Warneke and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302247).

         <title>NDI based C2&#8208;symmetric Chiral Supramolecular Hydrogels Towards Enhanced Conductivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To comprehend the significance of improved conductive properties in C2&#8208;symmetric hydrogels, it is vital to investigate how non&#8208;gelating achiral functional group isomers influence the conductivity of such supramolecular hydrogels, whereas understanding the major driving forces behind this regulatory process is first and foremost. Herein, we report a hydrogel system containing tryptophan&#8208;conjugated NDI as the backbone (L/D&#8208;NTrp), enabling effective supramolecular assembly with the bipyridyl functional group isomers. This co&#8208;assembly behavior results in materials with exceptional mechanical properties and high conductivities, surpassing most previously reported C2&#8208;symmetrical hydrogels, as well as the ability to form controlled morphologies. Notably, the co&#8208;hydrogels displayed an eight&#8208;fold increase in mechanical strength, making them more robust and resistant to deformation compared to the original gel. Additionally, all hydrogels exhibited favorable electrical conductivity, with the co&#8208;assembled hydrogels showcasing notable performance, making them a promising candidate for use in electronic devices and sensors. This report lays the foundation for further investigation into the properties and potential applications of L/D&#8208;NTrp compound in the range of fields, including drug delivery, tissue engineering, and electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Polymer Network based on Electrophilic Substitution (ES) Adduct of Furan&#8208;Triazolinedione</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymers with furan functionality have been the subject of extensive research on developing sustainable materials applying a limited number of dynamic covalent approaches. Herein, we introduce a facile, dynamic non&#8208;covalent approach to make a furan polymer readily accessible for self&#8208;healing applications based on its electrophilic substitution (ES) with a commercially available 1,2,4&#8208;triazoline&#8208;3,5&#8208;dione (TAD) derivative, 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;TAD (PTAD). A tailor&#8208;made furan polymer, poly(furfuryl methacrylate) (PFMA), considering it an initial illustrative example, was rapidly ES modified with PTAD to produce furfuryl&#8208;tagged triazolidine that subsequently associated via inter&#8208;molecular hydrogen (H&#8208;) bonding to produce a thermally reversible supramolecular polymer network under ambient conditions. The H&#8208;bonded network was experimentally quantified via ATR&#8208;IR analysis and theoretically rationalized via the density functional theory (DFT) study using smaller organic model compounds analogous to the macromolecular system. Thermoreversible feature of the H&#8208;bonded triazolidine&#8208;derived supramolecular polymer network enabled the solution reprocessing and self&#8208;healing of the polymer material.</dc:description>

         <title>Reductive Release from a Hybrid PKS&#8208;NRPS during the Biosynthesis of Pyrichalasin H</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reductive release of cytochalasin intermediates was studied in&#8197;vitro, showing that the R&#8208;domain requires a T&#8208;domain tethered substrate, but has low selectivity for the amino acid and polyketide moieties. Direct 2&#8208;electron reduction is the preferred mode of release, followed by rapid Knoevenagel cyclisation of the released aldehyde.







Abstract
Three central steps during the biosynthesis of cytochalasan precursors, including reductive release, Knoevenagel cyclisation and Diels Alder cyclisation are not yet understood at a detailed molecular level. In this work we investigated the reductive release step catalysed by a hybrid polyketide synthase non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS&#8208;NRPS) from the pyrichalasin H pathway. Synthetic thiolesters were used as substrate mimics for in&#8197;vitro studies with the isolated reduction (R) and holo&#8208;thiolation (T) domains of the PKS&#8208;NRPS hybrid PyiS. These assays demonstrate that the PyiS R&#8208;domain mainly catalyses an NADPH&#8208;dependent reductive release of an aldehyde intermediate that quickly undergoes spontaneous Knoevenagel cyclisation. The R&#8208;domain can only process substrates that are covalently bound to the phosphopantetheine thiol of the upstream T&#8208;domain, but it shows little selectivity for the polyketide.

         <title>Improving In Vivo Tumor Accumulation and Efficacy of Platinum Antitumor Agents by Electronic Tuning of the Kinetic Lability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This systemic study highlights the profound but contrasting impact of kinetic lability on in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo antitumor potencies of platinum complexes comprising of &#8216;O&#708;O&#8217; leaving ligand, in addition to demonstrating that along with other physicochemical properties, kinetic lability tuning is crucial for improving in&#8197;vivo tumor accumulation and efficacy of newly designed functional Pt antitumor agents.







Abstract
The impact of kinetic lability or reactivity on in&#8197;vitro cytotoxicity, stability in plasma, in&#8197;vivo tumor and tissue accumulation, and antitumor efficacy of functional platinum(II) (Pt) anticancer agents containing a O&#708;O &#946;&#8208;diketonate leaving ligand remain largely unexplored. To investigate this, we synthesized Pt complexes [(NH3)2Pt(L1&#8208;H)]NO3 and [(DACH)Pt(L1&#8208;H)]NO3 (L1=4,4,4&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;1&#8208;ferrocenylbutane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione, DACH=1R,2R&#8208;cyclohexane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine) containing an electron deficient [L1&#8208;H]&#8211; O&#708;O leaving ligand and [(NH3)2Pt(L2&#8208;H)]NO3 and [(DACH)Pt(L2&#8208;H)]NO3 (L2=1&#8208;ferrocenylbutane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione) containing an electron&#8208;rich [L2&#8208;H]&#8211; O&#708;O leaving ligand. While all four complexes have comparable lipophilicity, the presence of the electron&#8208;withdrawing CF3 group was found to dramatically enhance the reactivity of these complexes toward nucleophilic biomolecules. In vitro cellular assays revealed that the more reactive complexes have higher cellular uptake and higher anticancer potency as compared to their less reactive analogs. But the scenario is opposite in&#8197;vivo, where the less reactive complex showed improved tissue and tumor accumulation and better anticancer efficacy in mice bearing ovarian xenograft when compared to its more reactive analog. Finally, in addition to demonstrating the profound but contrasting impact of kinetic lability on in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo antitumor potencies, we also described the impact of kinetic lability on the mechanism of action of this class of promising antitumor agents.

         <title>Altering the Localization of an Unpaired Spin in a Formal Ni(V) Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fate of unpaired spin localization on a formal Ni(V) species: This work broadens the scope of the previously reported a Ni(III) bisphenoxyl diradical species by revealing how modest adjustments to the ligand field and temperature can determine the fate of localization of an unpaired spin on a previously unknown three oxidized equivalent species.







Abstract
The participation of both ligand and the metal center in the redox events has been recognized as one of the ways to attain the formal high valent complexes for the late 3d metals, such as Ni and Cu. Such an approach has been employed successfully to stabilize a Ni(III) bisphenoxyl diradical species in which there exist an equilibrium between the ligand and the Ni localized resultant spin. The present work, however, broadens the scope of the previously reported three oxidized equivalent species by conveying the approaches that tend to affect the reported equilibrium in CH3CN at 233&#8197;K. Various spectroscopic characterization revealed that employing exogenous N&#8208;donor ligands like 1&#8208;methyl imidazole and pyridine favors the formation of the Ni centered localized spin though axial binding. In contrast, due to its steric hinderance, quinoline favors an exclusive ligand localized radical species. DFT studies shed light on the novel intermediates&#8242; complex electronic structure. Further, the three oxidized equivalent species with the Ni centered spin was examined for its hydrogen atom abstraction ability stressing their key role in alike reactions.

         <title>Reticular Synthesis of Flexible Rare&#8208;Earth Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Control of Structural Dynamics and Sorption Properties Through Ligand Functionalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Control of the dynamic effects in flexible metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is critical towards engineering custom responsive materials. In this work, two novel families of flexible MOFs based on rare&#8208;earth metals were developed. The breathing capabilities and the eventual sorption properties change drastically by slight changes in the organic ligand, leading also to the emergence of unique gas and vapor sorption properties, including rare gas trapping phenomena.







Abstract
An exciting direction in metal&#8208;organic frameworks involves the design and synthesis of flexible structures which can reversibly adapt their structure when triggered by external stimuli. Controlling the extent and nature of response in such solids is critical in order to develop custom dynamic materials for advanced applications. Towards this, it is highly important to expand the diversity of existing flexible MOFs, generating novel materials and gain an in&#8208;depth understanding of the associated dynamic phenomena, eventually unlocking key structure&#8208;property relationships. In the present work, we successfully utilized reticular chemistry for the construction of two novel series of highly crystalline, flexible rare&#8208;earth MOFs, RE&#8208;thc&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 and RE&#8208;teb&#8208;MOF&#8208;1. Extensive single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal structural analyses coupled with detailed gas and vapor sorption studies, shed light onto the unique responsive behavior. The development of these series is related to the reported RE&#8208;thc&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 solids which were found to display a unique continuous breathing and gas&#8208;trapping property. The synthesis of RE&#8208;thc&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 and RE&#8208;teb&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 materials represents an important milestone as they provide important insights into the key factors that control the responsive properties of this fascinating family of flexible materials and demonstrates that it is possible to control their dynamic behavior and the associated gas and vapor sorption properties.

In the present work, we successfully utilized reticular chemistry for the construction of two novel series of highly crystalline, flexible rare-earth MOFs, RE-&lt;b&gt;thc&lt;/b&gt;-MOF-2 and RE-&lt;b&gt;teb&lt;/b&gt;-MOF-1. Extensive single-crystal to single-crystal structural analyses coupled with detailed gas and vapor sorption studies, shed light onto the unique responsive behavior. The development of these series is related to the reported RE-&lt;b&gt;thc&lt;/b&gt;-MOF-1 solids which were found to display a unique continuous breathing and gas-trapping property. The synthesis of RE-&lt;b&gt;thc&lt;/b&gt;-MOF-2 and RE-&lt;b&gt;teb&lt;/b&gt;-MOF-1 materials represents an important milestone as they provide important insights into the key factors that control the responsive properties of this fascinating family of flexible materials and demonstrates that it is possible to control their dynamic behavior and the associated gas and vapor sorption properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unraveling the Push&#8208;Pull Effect in Acenes, Polyenes and Polyynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of the charge of the substituent active region allowed us to reveal how electron withdrawing and donating properties of polyene, polyyne and acene spacers change with their length. It is also shown how the substituent effect strength between two groups diminishes with distance. The effect of substituent on electron delocalization can be extracted using EDDB (Electron Density of Delocalized Bonds) differential maps.







Abstract
Substituent effects (SEs) are fundamental for predicting molecular reactivity, while polyene, polyyne and acene derivatives are precursors to compounds with diverse applications. Computations were performed for Y&#8208;R&#8208;X systems, where reaction sites Y=NO2 and O&#8722;, substituents X=NO2, CN, Cl, H, OH, NH2, and spacers R=polyene, polyyne (n=1&#8208;5, 10 repeating units) and acene (up to tetracene). The cSAR (charge of the substituent active region) approach allowed to present, for the first time, quantitative relations describing the spacer's electron&#8208;donating and withdrawing properties as a function of n and the spacer type. The electronic properties of the X substituents depend on the type of spacer, its length and the Y group, which is an example of the reverse SE. To describe how the SE between Y and X weakens with n, two approaches were compared: cSAR and SESE (SE stabilization energy). The EDDB (electron density of delocalized bonds) characterize changes in electron delocalization in spacers due to the SE. A new approach &#8211; EDDB differential maps &#8211; allow to extract the effect of X substitution on the electron delocalization. The charges at spacer's C atoms correlate with cSAR; changes in the slopes confirm the charge transfer by resonance.

         <title>Dibenzoindolo[1,8]naphthyridines: Synthesis and Characterization of X&#8208;Shaped Aza[4,6]helicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis strategy to obtain double [4]&#8208; and [6]&#8208;azahelicene structures with central 1,8&#8208;naphthyrinde core is described. Synthesis method allows four bond formation in one&#8208;pot multi&#8208;step reaction with easy diversification of substituents. Experimental data of optical and electrochemical properties, as well as theoretical calculations of selected product examples, are presented.







Abstract
This report describes a one&#8208;pot multi&#8208;step procedure to obtain double azahelicenes via nucleophilic fluorine substitution of 2,2&#8208;di(2&#8208;bromophenyl)&#8208;1,1&#8208;difluoroalkenes and palladium&#8208;catalysed ring closing reaction. The developed synthesis approach allows easy diversification of substituents at all four fragments of the obtained X&#8208;shaped aza[4,6]helicene entity. Yields range from 20&#8201;% to 60&#8201;% among 12 product examples. X&#8208;ray single crystal analysis reveals formation of (P,P) and (M,M) enantiomer mixture of products. Optical and electrochemical properties of selected products were studied by performing UV/Vis absorption, photoluminescence and cyclic voltammetry measurements. Experimental results are supported by (TD)&#8208;DFT, NICS and NICS2BC calculations.

         <title>Lanthanide Mimicking by Magnesium for Oxazolidinone Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A monomeric magnesium compound was employed as a catalyst for the cascade cyclization of propargylic alcohol and isocyanate, resulting in the formation of pharmaceutically significant oxazolidinone derivatives. This transformation, previously attributed solely to transition metals or lanthanides, signifies a noteworthy advancement.







Abstract
In the last decade, magnesium complexes have emerged as a viable alternative to transition&#8208;metal catalysts for the hydrofunctionalization of unsaturated bonds. However, their potential for advanced catalytic reactions has not been thoroughly investigated. To address this gap, we have developed a novel magnesium amide compound (3) using a PNP framework that is both bulky and flexible. Our research demonstrates that compound 3 can effectively catalyze the synthesis of biologically significant oxazolidinone derivatives. This synthesis involves a tandem reaction of hydroalkoxylation and cyclohydroamination of isocyanate using propargyl alcohol. Furthermore, we conducted comprehensive theoretical calculations to gain insights into the reaction mechanism. It is important to note that these types of transformations have not been reported for magnesium and would significantly enhance the catalytic portfolio of the 7th most abundant element.

A high&#8208;quality inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolyte (ISE) is essential for achieving both high energy density and enhanced safety in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs). A well&#8208;functioning ISE/Li interface plays a pivotal role in attaining high&#8208;performance ASSLMBs. Poor interface contact and stability can lead to the deterioration of ASSLMB performance. Hence, various interface modification methods are employed to enhance the ISE/Li interface.







Abstract
The increasing demand for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and high&#8208;safety energy storage devices has sparked a growing interest in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs). A high&#8208;quality inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolyte (ISE) is a fundamental requirement for ASSLMBs, and an effective ISE/Li interface is a key factor in attaining high&#8208;performance ASSLMBs. In this Concept, we initially summarize the challenges encountered by ISE/Li interfaces and delineate four commonly employed strategies for modifying the ISE/Li interface. Then, we explore the merits and drawbacks of coatings utilized as ISE/Li interfacial phases. We also delve into the commonly employed thermal bonding and innovative cold bonding methods utilized for in&#8197;situ interface preparation. Lastly, we spotlight future directions for enhancing the functionality of ISE/Li interfaces and achieving high&#8208;performance ASSLMBs.

         <dc:description>Multifunctional groups diarylamines, an innovative product, efficiently produced from arylamines and p&#8208;nitrosoanisole derivatives by intermolecular SNAr under weak acid conditions. This SNAr proceeds under mild reaction conditions, and more significantly, the substrates involved do not necessarily require strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. Moreover, this SNAr is characterized by resistance to space crowding, tolerance to halogen and nitroso functional groups, and high regioselectivity. Mechanistic observations suggest that the SNAr is the result of the transfer of the positive charge center of the protonated nitroso group to the p&#8208;methoxy group.</dc:description>

         <title>A Primer On 2D Descriptors In Selectivity Modeling For Asymmetric Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Machine learning has permeated all fields of research, including chemistry, and is now an integral part of design of novel compounds with desired properties. In the field of asymmetric catalysis, the preference still lies with models based on physical understanding of the catalysis phenomenon and electronic and steric properties of catalysts. However, such models require quantum chemical calculations and are thus limited by their computational cost. Here, we highlight the recent advances in modeling catalyst selectivity using 2D structures of catalysts and substrates. While these have a less explicit mechanistic connection to the modeled property, 2D descriptors, such as topological indices, molecular fingerprints, and fragments, offer a tremendous advantage of low cost and high speed of calculations. This makes them optimal for in silico screening of large amount of data. We provide an overview of a common Quantitative Structure&#8208;Property Relationship (QSPR) workflow, model building and validation techniques, applications of these methodologies in asymmetric catalysis design, as well as the outlook on improving the understanding of 2D&#8208;based models.</dc:description>

         <title>Soft multi&#8208;layer actuators integrated with the functions of electrical energy harvest and storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Soft multi&#8208;layer actuators are smart, lightweight, and flexible, which can be used in a wide range of fields such as artificial muscles, advanced medical devices, and wearable devices. The research on the actuation property of the soft actuators has made significant progress, paving the way for the controllable motions of the actuators. However, compared with the intelligence and adaptability of life in nature, these actuators still have the problem of insufficient intelligence. The phenomenon is reflected in a lack of continuous supply of energy. Therefore, it has become a development trend to combine functions such as energy harvesting, storage, and conversion with actuators to build intelligent actuators. This concept presents a synopsis of the advancements made in soft actuators that have been coupled with the capabilities of electrical energy harvesting and storage. The design concepts and typical applications of this soft smart actuators are introduced in detail. Finally, the future research directions and applications of smart actuators are prospected from our perspective.</dc:description>

         <title>NHC&#8208;Stabilized Mixed Group 13/14/15 Element Hydrides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The syntheses of novel N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) adducts of group 13, 14 and 15 element hydrides are reported. Salt metathesis reactions between NaPH2 and IDipp&#183;GeH2BH2OTf (1) (IDipp&#160;= 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) led to mixtures of the two isomers IDipp&#183;GeH2BH2PH2 (2a) and IDipp&#183;BH2GeH2PH2 (2b); by altering the reaction conditions an almost exclusive formation of 2b was achieved. Attempts to purify mixtures of 2a and 2b by re&#8208;crystallization from THF afforded a salt [IDipp&#183;GeH2BH2&#183;IDipp][PHGeH2BH2PH2BH2GeH2] (4) that contains the novel anionic cyclohexyl&#8208;like inorganic heterocycle [PHGeH2BH2PH2BH2GeH2]&#8208;. In addition, the borane adducts IDipp&#183;GeH2BH2PH2BH3 (3a) and IDipp&#183;BH2GeH2PH2BH3 (3b) as even longer chain compounds were obtained from reactions of 2a/2b with H3B&#183;SMe2 and were studied by NMR spectroscopy. Accompanying DFT computations give insight into the mechanism and energetics associated with 2a/2b isomerization as well as their decomposition pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>B&#8208;P Coupling: Metal Stabilized Phosphinoborate Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In an effort to establish B&#8208;P coupling reactions without the use of phosphine&#8208;borane dehydrocoupling agent, we have developed a new synthetic methodology employing group 8 metal &#963;&#8208;borate complex [{&#954;3&#8208;H,S,S'&#8208;BH2L2}Ru{&#954;3&#8208;H,H,S&#8208;BH3L}] (L = NC5H4S), 1. Treatment of 1 with chlorodiphenyl phosphine (PPh2Cl) yielded 1,5&#8208;P,S chelated Ru&#8208;dihydridoborate species [PPh2H{&#954;3&#8208;H,H,S&#8208;BH(OH)L}Ru{&#954;2&#8208;P,S&#8208;(Ph2P)BH2L}], 2. The insertion of phosphine moiety (PPh2) by the cleavage of 3c&#8208;2e &#963;(Ru&#8230;H&#8208;B) bonding interaction led to the formation of B&#8208;P bond. The &#954;2&#8208;P,S chelated six&#8208;membered ring adopted a boat conformation in complex 2. The heterocycle is made of all different atoms, which is one of the rarest examples of heteroatomic ring systems. Theoretical outcomes demonstrated the electronic insight of B&#8208;P coupling and stabilization through transition metal. In order to explore an alternate route of B&#8208;P bond formation, we have further explored the reaction of 1 and Ru&#8208;bis(dihydridoborate) complex, 5 with secondary phosphine oxide (SPO). Although, thermolysis of 1 with diphenylphosphine oxide yielded analogous &#963; &#8208;borate complex 3, the similar reaction of 5 at room temperature led to the formation of novel phosphinous(III) acid incorporated Ru(&#963;&#8208;borate)(dihydridoborate) complex, 6. In a similar fashion, the reaction of 5 with phosphite ligand generated Ru(&#963;&#8208;borate)(dihydridoborate) complex, 7, which is analogous to 6.</dc:description>

         <title>Diindolocarbazole&#8208;based Rigid Donor&#8208;acceptor TADF&#160;Molecules for Energy and Electron Transfer Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design and synthesis of four twisted donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules CBZ&#8208;IQ, CBZ&#8208;2FIQ, DI&#8208;IQ and DI&#8208;2FIQ is reported in this work based on diindolocarbazole (DI) and phenyl carbazole as donor and indoloquinoxalines as acceptor. These compounds serve as photocatalysts for organic transformations. Theoretical calculations and experimental data showed reasonable singlet and triplet energy gaps of 0.17&#8208;0.26 eV for all compounds. All molecules showed increase in fluorescence quantum yields after degassing the solution and the transient photoluminescence decay showed two components: shorter prompt components (11.4 ns to 31 ns) and longer delayed components (36.4 ns to 1.5 &#956;s) which further indicate the occurrence of TADF process. Cyclic voltammetry studies indicated well&#8208;suited excited state redox potentials of all compounds to catalyze organic transformations such as heteroarene arylation. Accordingly, photocatalytic C&#8208;H arylation of heteroarenes were performed using these compounds with excellent isolated yields of upto 80%. Due to their suitable efficient triplet energy levels, all the emitters were also employed as energy transfer photocatalysts in E to Z isomerization of stilbene with the excellent conversion of ~ 90%.</dc:description>

         <title>Dimerization and crowding in the binding of interleukin 8 to dendritic glycosaminoglycans as artificial proteoglycans</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interactions of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) with proteins of the extracellular matrix govern and regulate complex physiological functions including cellular growth, immune response, and inflammation. Repetitive presentation of GAG binding motifs as found in native proteoglycans might enhance GAG&#8211;protein binding through multivalent interactions. Here, we report the chemical synthesis of dendritic GAG oligomers&#160;constructed of nona&#8208;sulfated hyaluronan tetrasaccharides&#160;for investigating the binding of the protein chemokine interleukin&#160;8 (IL&#8208;8) to artificial, well&#8208;defined proteoglycan architectures. Binding of mutant monomeric and native dimerizable IL&#8208;8 was investigated by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry. Dendritic oligomerization of GAG increased the binding affinity of both monomeric and dimeric IL&#8208;8. Monomeric IL&#8209;8 bound to monomeric and dimeric GAG with&#160;KD&#160;values of 7.3 &#181;M and 0.108 &#181;M, respectively. The effect was less pronounced for dimerizable wildtype IL&#8208;8, for which GAG dimerization improved the affinity from 34 nM to 5 nM. Binding of dimeric IL&#8208;8 to oligomeric GAG was limited by steric crowding effects, strongly reducing the affinity of subsequent binding events. In conclusion, the strongest effect of GAG oligomerization was the amplified binding of IL&#8208;8 monomers, which might concentrate monomeric protein in the extracellular matrix and thus promote protein dimerization under physiological conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;assembly of Discrete Oligomers of Naphthalenediimides in Bulk and on Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report on the synthesis of discrete oligomers of alkyl&#8208;bridged naphthalenediimides (NDIs) and study their molecular nanostructures both in bulk, in solution and at the solid&#8208;liquid interface. Via an iterative synthesis method, multiple NDI cores were bridged with short and saturated alkyl&#8208;diamines (C3 and C12) or long and unsaturated alkyl&#8208;diamines (u2C33 to u8C100) at their imide termini. The strong intermolecular interaction between the NDI cores was observed by probing their photophysical properties in solution. In bulk, the discrete NDI oligomers preferentially ordered in lamellar morphologies, irrespective of whether a saturated or unsaturated spacer was employed. Moreover, both the molecular architecture as well as the crystallization conditions play a significant role in the nanoscale ordering. The long unsaturated alkyl chains lead preferably to folded&#8208;chain conformations while their saturated analogues form stretched arrangements. At the solution&#8208;solid interface, well&#8208;defined lamellar regions were observed. These results show that precision in chemical structure alone is not sufficient to reach well&#8208;defined structures of discrete oligomers, but that it must be combined with precision in processing conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Structurally diverse Pyrene&#8208;decorated planar chiral [2,2]paracyclophanes with tunable circularly polarized luminescence between monomer and excimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We reported the synthesis of a series of structurally diverse CPL&#8208;active molecules, in which pyrene units were installed to chiral pm/po&#8208;[2.2]PCP scaffolds either with or without a triple bond spacer for pm/po&#8208;PCP&#8208;P1 and pm/po&#8208;PCP&#8208;P2, respectively. The X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses revealed that these pyrene&#8208;based [2,2]PCP derivatives exhibited diverse structures and crystal packings in the solid phases. The pyrene&#8208;based [2,2]PCP derivatives exhibit various (chir)optical properties in organic solutions, depending on their respective structures. In a mixture of dioxane and water, pm/po&#8208;PCP&#8208;P1 emit green excimer fluorescence, whereas pm/po&#8208;PCP&#8208;P2 emit blue one. The chiroptical investigation demonstrated that Rp&#8208;pm&#8208;PCP&#8208;P1 and Rp&#8208;pm&#8208;PCP&#8208;P2 exhibited completely opposite CD and CPL signals even they possess the same chiral Rp&#8208;[2.2]PCP core. The same argument also holds for other chiral pyrene&#8208;based [2,2]PCP derivatives. The theoretical calculation revealed that these unusual phenomena were attributed to different orientation between transition electric dipole moments and the magnetic dipole moments&#160;originating from the presence or absence of a triple bond spacer. These pyrene&#8208;based [2,2]PCP derivatives display various colors and fluorescence emissions in the solid state and PMMA films, possibly due to the different packings as observed in the crystal structure. Moreover, these compounds also can interact with perylenediimide through &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, leading to near&#8208;white fluorescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Urea Promoted Neat Synthesis of Fused Dihydroisoquinolines and Disubstituted Pyridines: A Mechanistic Observation with Molecular Sensing Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient and short synthesis of fused dihydroisoquinolines, diaryl substituted pyridine derivatives have been established in good to high yields using an environmentally safe, solvent&#8208;metal&#8208;oxidant&#8208;free tandem approach. In this article, we have discussed that the electrocyclic reaction is more pronounced in solid phase in presence of urea whereas the typical aza&#8208;Michael addition is more prominent in presence of arylamine in the solution phase for the substrate 3&#8208;(2&#8208;formylcycloalkenyl)&#8208;acrylic ester derivatives. The wide range of substrate variations and urea&#8208;promoted neat synthesis made our approach more significant in medical and also analytical science. Moreover, the isoquinoline alkaloid Decumbenine B analogue has been synthesized using our newly developed neat methodology. We have also investigated the photophysical properties of the synthesized fused dihydroisoquinoline derivatives. One of the synthesized molecules was used as a sensor for the selective detection of toxic picric acid. Therefore, the effective neat synthesis and molecular sensing applications of these compounds made our approach more exciting in the field of heterocyclic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Amination of 3&#8209;Substituted&#8208;2&#8208;benzofuranones via Non&#8208;covalent N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, an efficient method for asymmetric &#945;&#8208;amination of 2&#8208;benzofuranones with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis is reported. The process is based on non&#8208;covalent interaction of NHC with substrate, facilitating the formation of a chiral ion&#8208;pair that encompasses enolate and azolium salt. The activated enolate adds to an electrophilic amine source with sufficient facial control to furnish an enantioenriched product having an amine substituted quaternary stereocenter. The process displays a broad substrate scope. A preparative scale synthesis has been achieved. Preliminary mechanistic investigations based on experimental and DFT studies suggest a reaction pathway that involves non&#8208;covalent substrate/NHC interactions and essentially implicate the role of &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction in diastereomeric transition states for stereo&#8208;chemical discrimination.</dc:description>

         <title>Hole&#8208;Transporting Materials based on Oligo(hetero)aryls with a Naphthodithiophene Core &#8208; Succinct Synthesis by Twofold Direct C&#8208;H Olefination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work demonstrated the first synthetic application of direct C&#8208;H olefinations in the step&#8208;saving preparation of various hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTM) for efficient perovskite solar cells (PSC). Cross&#8208;dehydrogenative couplings of naphthodithiophene (NDT) with vinyl arenes under palladium&#8208;catalysis facilely generated various new oligo(hetero)aryls with internal alkenes. Reaction conditions were optimized, which gave the product isolated yields of up to 71% with high (E)&#8208;stereoselectivity. These readily accessible NDT core&#8208;based small molecules involving olefin as &#960;&#8208;spacers displayed immediate power conversion efficiencies of up to 17.2% without a device oxidation process that is required for the commercially available spiro&#8208;OMeTAD and most other existing HTMs while fabricated in corresponding PSC devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Perchlorate Sensing Using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy with Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers of semiaza&#8208;Bambusurils</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SAMs of novel semiaza&#8208;bambus[6]urils equipped with thioethers or dithiolane functionalities as surface&#8208;anchoring groups on gold electrodes were characterized. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy employing both negative and positively charged redox couples revealed that derivatives equipped with benzyl methyl thioether, especially the lipoic amide group, were suitable for anion sensing measurements and bound perchlorate preferentially over other anions.







Abstract
In the last two decades, perchlorate salts have been identified as environmental pollutants and recognized as potential substances affecting human health. We describe self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) of novel semiaza&#8208;bambus[6]urils (semiaza&#8208;BUs) equipped with thioethers or disulfide (dithiolane) functionalities as surface&#8208;anchoring groups on gold electrodes. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) with Fe(CN)63&#8722;/4&#8722; as a redox probe, together with X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and ellipsometry, were employed to characterize the interactions at the interface between the anchoring groups and the metal substrate. Data showed that the anion receptors&#8242; packing on the gold strongly depends on the anchoring group. As a result, SAMs of BUs with lipoic amide side chains show a concentration&#8208;dependent layer thickness. The BU SAMs are extremely stable on repeated electrochemical potential scans and can selectively recognize perchlorate anions. Our electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies indicated that semiaza&#8208;BU equipped with the lipoic amide side chains binds perchlorate (2&#8211;100&#8197;mM) preferentially over other anions such as F&#8722;, Cl&#8722;, I&#8722;, AcO&#8722;, H2PO4&#8722;, HPO42&#8722;, SO42&#8722;, NO2&#8722;, NO3&#8722;, or CO32&#8722;. The resistance performance is 10 to 100&#8197;times more efficient than SAMs containing all other tested anions.

         <title>Chiral Benzene Triimide (BTI) Radical Anions for Probing the Interplay of Unpaired Electron Spin and Chirality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of novel chiral Benzene triimide (BTI) radical anions are reported. The interplay between the unpaired electron spin and chiral substituents is revealed by NIR circularly polarized light absorptions that arise from the unpaired electron spin transition. The modulation is attributed to chiral substitutes regulated transition dipole moments of the unpaired electron spin participated transition.







Abstract
Herein a series of chiral BTI radical anions bearing different chiral substituents were efficiently prepared by chemical reduction. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed finely&#8208;tuned packing and helix assemblies of the radicals by the size of chiral substituents in crystalline state. In accordance with the crystalline&#8208;state packing, the powder ESR spectra indicate that 4&#8201;a&#8722;&#8901;CoCp2+ and 4&#8201;c&#8722;&#8901;CoCp2+ &#960;&#8208;dimers exhibit thermally excited triplet states arising from strong spin&#8208;spin interactions, while discrete 4&#8201;b&#8722;&#8901;CoCp2+ shows a broad doublet&#8208;state signal reflecting weak spin&#8208;spin interactions. The interplay between the unpaired electron spin and chiral substituents was studied by UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR spectra, electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and TD DFT calculations. Different NIR absorptions of the radicals attributing to isolated SOMO&#8594;LUMO+1 (~889&#8197;nm) transitions were recorded. The emergence of Cotton effects (CEs) at the NIR region for 4&#8201;c&#8722;&#8901;CoCp2+ radical enantiomers suggest the interplay between chirality and unpaired electron spin. The origin of the different circularly polarized light absorptions regarding SOMO derived transitions (around 880&#8197;nm) was attributed to chiral substitutes regulated electric and magnetic transition dipole moments of the unpaired electron participated transition.

         <title>Generation of Bioactivity&#8208;Tailored FK506/FK520 Analogs by CRISPR Editing in Streptomyces tsukubaensis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Genetic engineering by targeted CRISPR editing was used to establish a sustainable production process for bioactivity&#8208;tailored FK506/FK520 analogues displaying FKBP12 binding while calcineurin inhibition was spared for a potential use in acute kidney injury (AKI).







Abstract
For a potential application of FK506 in the treatment of acute kidney failure only the FKBP12 binding capability of the compound is required, while the immunosuppressive activity via calcineurin binding is considered as a likely risk to the patients. The methoxy groups at C13 and C15 are thought to have significant influence on the immunosuppressive activity of the molecule. Consequently, FK506 analogs with different functionalities at C13 and C15 were generated by targeted CRISPR editing of the AT domains in module&#8197;7 and 8 of the biosynthetic assembly line in Streptomyces tsukubaensis. In addition, the corresponding FK520 (C21 ethyl derivative of FK506) analogs could be obtained by media adjustments. The compounds were tested for their bioactivity in regards to FKBP12 binding, BMP potentiation and calcineurin sparing. 15&#8208;desmethoxy FK506 was superior to the other tested analogs as it did not inhibit calcineurin but retained high potency towards FKBP12 binding and BMP potentiation.

         <title>A New Series of Sandwich&#8208;Type&#160;5,5'&#8208;Biterphenylenes:&#160;Synthetic Challenge, Structural Uniqueness and Photodynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A&#160;new series of biaryls, bi&#8208;linear&#8208;terphenylenes (BLTPs),&#160;were prepared using the&#160;tert&#8208;butyllithium&#8208;mediated cyclization as&#160;the key synthetic step.&#160;The three&#8208;dimensional structures of the studied compounds were verified using X&#8208;ray crystallography and DFT calculations. Tetraaryl(ethynyl)&#8208;substituted&#160;BLTPs&#160;are highly&#160;crowded molecules, and the internal rotation around the central C&#8208;C bond is restricted due to a high barrier (&gt;50 kcal/mol). These structures containseveral&#160;aryl/terphenylenyl/aryl sandwiches, where the&#160;through&#8208;space&#160;&#960;&#8208;&#960;&#160;&#160;(TSPP) interactions&#160;are strongly reflected in the shielding of&#160;1H NMR chemical shifts, reduction of oxidation potentials, increasing aromaticity of the central six&#8208;membered ring and decreasing antiaromaticity of the four&#8208;membered rings in a terpheny&#8208;lenyl moiety&#160;based on&#160;NICS(0) and iso&#8208;chemical shielding surfaces.&#160;Despite the restricted C&#8208;C&#160;bond associated intramolecular TSPP&#160;interactions&#160;for BLTPs&#160;in the ground state, to our surprise, the electronic coupling between two linear terphenylenes&#160;(LTPs)&#160;in BLTPs in the excited state is weak, so that the excited&#8208;state behavior is dominated by the corresponding monomeric LTPs. In other words, all BLTPs undergo ultrafast relaxation dynamics via strong exciton&#8208;vibration coupling, acting as a blue&#8208;light absorber with essentially no emission.</dc:description>

         <title>Extremely Slow Thermally&#8208;Induced Spin Crossover in the Two&#8208;Dimensional Network [Fe(bbtr)3](BF4)2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The changed phase&#8208;transition order causes an extremely slow spin transition in a 2D coordination polymer [Fe(bbtr)3](BF4)2 regarded so far as a thermally&#8208;induced spin crossover inactive compound.







Abstract
Cooling [Fe(bbtr)3](BF4)2 (bbtr=1,4&#8208;di(1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)butane) triggers very slow spin crossover below 80&#8197;K (T1/2&#8595;=76&#8197;K). The spin crossover (SCO) is accompanied by a hysteresis loop (T1/2&#8593;=89&#8197;K). In contrast to isostructural perchlorate analogue [Fe(bbtr)3](ClO4)2 in which spin crossover during cooling is preceded by phase transition at TPT=126&#8197;K in tetrafluoroborate phase transition does not occur to the beginning of spin crossover (80&#8197;K). Studies of mixed crystals [Fe(bbtr)3](BF4)2(1&#8208;x)(ClO4)2x (0.5&#8804;x&#8804;0.9) showed that a phase transition precedes spin crossover, however, for x&#8773;0.46 intersection of T1/2(x) and TPT(x) dependencies takes place. The application of pressure of 1&#8197;GPa shifts the spin crossover in [Fe(bbtr)3](BF4)2 to a temperature above 270&#8197;K. High&#8208;pressure studies of neat tetrafluoroborate and perchlorate, as well as mixed crystals [Fe(bbtr)3](BF4)2(1&#8208;x)(ClO4)2x (0.1&#8804;x&#8804;0.9), revealed that at 295&#8197;K P1/2 value changes linearly with x indicating similar mechanism of spin crossover under elevated pressure in all systems under investigation. Variable pressure single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies confirmed that in contrast to thermally induced spin crossover undergoing differently in tetrafluoroborate and perchlorate an application of high pressure removes this differentiation leading to a similar mechanism depending at first on start spin crossover and then P&#8208;3&#8594;P&#8208;1 phase transition occurs. In this report we have shown that 2D coordination polymer [Fe(bbtr)3](BF4)2 (bbtr=1,4&#8208;di(1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)butane) treated to date as spin crossover silent shows thermally induced spin crossover phenomenon. Spin crossover in tetrafluoroborate is extremely slow. Determination of the spin crossover curve required carrying measurement in the settle mode&#8208;cooling from 85 to 70&#8197;K took about 600&#8197;h (average velocity of change of temperature ca. 0.0004&#8197;K/min).

         <title>A Metal&#8208;Free Molecular Ferroelectric [4&#8208;Me&#8208;cyclohexylamine]ClO4 Introduced by Boat and Chair Conformations of Cyclohexylamine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By choosing a polar and flexible organic cation trans&#8208;4&#8208;methylcyclohexylamine (4&#8208;MCHA+) to assemble with the inorganic perchloric acid, we obtained a new metal&#8208;free organic ferroelectric molecular material (4&#8208;MCHA)ClO4 (1). Remarkably, the ferroelectric phase transition (Pmn21&#8594;Pmmn) arises from the joint contribution of symmetry breaking and unusual anti&#8208;conformational reversal of organic cations.







Abstract
Organic ferroelectrics have received a great deal of interest due to their exclusive properties. However, organic ferroelectrics have not been fully explored, which hinders their practical application. Here, we presented a novel metal&#8208;free organic molecular ferroelectric [4&#8208;MCHA][ClO4] (1) (4&#8208;MCHA=trans&#8208;4&#8208;methylcyclohexylamine), which exhibits an above&#8208;room&#8208;temperature of 328&#8197;K. Strikingly, the single crystal structure analysis of 1 shows that the driving force of phase transition is related to the interesting chair&#8208;boat conformation change of 4&#8208;MCHA cation, in addition to the order&#8208;disorder transition of ClO4&#8722; anion. Using piezoelectric response force microscopy (PFM), the presence of domains and the implemented polarization switching were clearly observed, which explicitly determined the presence of room&#8208;temperature ferroelectricity of 1. As far as we know, the ferroelectric phase transition mechanism attributed to the conformational change in a trans isomeric cation is very rare. This research enriched the path of designing ferroelectric materials and smart materials.

         <title>Calamitic Liquid Crystals for Reversible Light&#8208;Modulated Phase Regulation Based on Arylazopyrazole Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of light responsive arylazopyrazole mesogens and their light&#8208;controlled liquid&#8208;crystalline phase regulation are reported. These compounds can act as a dopant in commercially available liquid crystals to provide fast and microscale optical responses at ambient temperatures.







Abstract
The design of responsive liquid crystals enables a diversity of technological applications. Especially photochromic liquid crystals gained a lot of interest in recent years due to the excellent spatiotemporal control of their phase transitions. In this work we present calamitic light responsive mesogens based on a library of arylazopyrazole photoswitches. These compounds show liquid&#8208;crystalline behavior as shown by differential scanning calorimetry, grazing incidence X&#8208;ray diffraction and polarized optical microscopy. UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy and NMR analysis confirmed the excellent photophysical properties in solution and thin film. Additionally, polarized optical microscopy studies of the pristine compounds show reversible phase transition upon irradiation with light. Moreover, as a dopant in the commercially available liquid crystal 4&#8208;cyano&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;pentylbiphenyl (5CB), the temperature range was reduced to ambient temperatures while preserving the photophysical properties. Remarkably, this co&#8208;assembled system shows reversible liquid&#8208;crystalline to isotropic phase transition upon irradiation with light of different wavelengths. The spatiotemporal control of the phase transition of the liquid crystals offers opportunities in the development of optical devices.

         <title>Defect engineering on electrocatalysts for sustainable nitrate reduction to ammonia: Fundamentals and regulations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitrate (NO3&#8208;) reduction to ammonia (NH3) is a &#8220;two birds&#8208;one stone&#8221; method that targets remediation of NO3&#8208;&#8208;containing sewage and production of valuable NH3. The exploitation of advanced catalysts with high activity, selectivity, and durability is a key issue for the efficient catalytic performance. Among various strategies for catalyst design, defect engineering has gained increasing attention due to its ability to modulate the electronic properties of electrocatalysts and optimize the adsorption energy of reactive species, thereby enhancing the catalytic performance. Despite previous progress, there remains a lack of mechanistic insights into the regulation of catalyst defects for NO3&#8208; reduction. Herein, this review presents insightful understanding of defect engineering for NO3&#8208; reduction, covering its background, definition, classification, construction, and underlying mechanisms. Moreover, the relationships between regulation of catalyst defects and their catalytic activities are illustrated by investigating the properties of electrocatalysts through the analysis of electronic band structure, charge density distribution, and controllable adsorption energy. Furthermore, challenges and perspectives for future development of defects in NO3RR are also discussed, which can help researchers to better understand the defect engineering in catalysts, and also inspire scientists entering into this promising field.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Intrinsic Magnetic Hardness by Modulating Antagonistic Interactions in the Rare&#8208;Earth&#8208;Free Magnetic Solid Solution Hf2Fe1&#8722; &#948; Ru5&#8722; x Ir x + &#948; B2</title>

         <dc:description>The quinary members in the solid solution Hf2Fe1&#8722;&#948;Ru5&#8722;xIrx+&#948;B2 (x = 1&#8208;4, VE = 63&#8208;66) have been investigated experimentally and computationally. They were synthesized via arc&#8208;melting and analyzed by EDX and&#160;X&#8208;ray diffraction. Density functional theory (DFT)&#160;calculations predicted a preference for magnetic ordering in all members, but with a strong competition between ferro&#8208; and antiferromagnetism arising from interchain Fe&#8208;Fe interactions. The spin exchange and magnetic anisotropy energies predicted the lowest magnetic hardness for x = 1 and 3 and the highest for x = 2. Magnetization measurements confirm the DFT predictions and demonstrate that the antiferromagnetic ordering (TN = 55&#8208;70 K) found at low magnetic fields changed to ferromagnetic (TC = 150&#8208;750 K) at higher fields, suggesting metamagnetic behavior for all samples. As predicted, Hf2FeRu3Ir2B2 has the highest intrinsic coercivity (Hc = 74 kA/m) reported to date for Ti3Co5B2&#8208;type phases. Furthermore, all coercivities outperform that of ferromagnetic Hf2FeIr5B2, indicating the importance of AFM interactions in enhancing magnetic anisotropy in these materials. Importantly, two members (x = 1 and 4) maintain intrinsic coercivities in the semi&#8208;hard range at room temperature. This study opens an avenue for controlling magnetic hardness by modulating antagonistic AFM and FM interactions in low&#8208;dimensional rare&#8208;earth&#8208;free magnetic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Reinforcing the Adsorption and Conversion of Polysulfides in Li&#8208;S Battery by Incorporating Molybdenum into MnS/MnO Nanorods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Sabatier principle suggests that an excessive adsorption of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) by metal compounds may hinder their conversion in the absence of a conversion module. Therefore, it is imperative to establish a synergetic effect mechanism between &#8220;strong adsorption&#8221; and &#8220;rapid conversion&#8221; for LiPSs. To achieve this coexistence, a molybdenum&#8208;doped MnS/MnO@C porous structure is designed as a multifunctional coating on the polypropylene (PP) separator. The incorporation of MnS/MnO@C enhances the adsorption capacity towards LiPSs, while molybdenum facilitates subsequent conversions. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of each component and its large specific surface area, the cell with Mo&#8208;doped MnS/MnO@C coating achieves smooth adsorption&#8208;diffusion&#8208;conversion processes and exhibits an appreciable rate performance with outstanding cycling stability. Even when sulfur loading increasing to 9.68 mg cm&#8208;2, the modified battery delivers an excellent initial areal capacity of 11.69 mAh cm&#8208;2 and maintains 6.97 mAh cm&#8208;2 after 50 cycles at 0.1 C. This study presents a promising approach to simultaneously accomplish &#8220;strong adsorption&#8221; and &#8220;rapid conversion&#8221; of polysulfides, offering neoteric views for devising dual&#8208;functional modified separators.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen substitution regulates high temperature dielectric switch in lead&#8208;free chiral hybrid perovskites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hybrid metal halides (HMHs) based phase transition materials have received widespread attention due to their excellent performance and potential applications in energy harvesting, optoelectronics, ferroics, and actuators. Nevertheless, effectively regulating the properties of phase transitions is still a thorny problem. In this work, we synthesized two chiral lead&#8208;free HMHs (R&#8208;3FP)2SbCl5 (1; 3FP = 3&#8208;fluoropyrrolidinium) and (R&#8208;3FP)2SbBr5 (2). By replacing the halide ions in the inorganic skeleton, the phase transition temperature of 2 changes with an increase of about 20 K, compared with 1. Meanwhile, both compounds display reversible dielectric switching properties. Through crystal structure analysis and Hirshfeld surface analysis, their phase transitions are ascribed to the disorder of the cations and deformation of the inorganic chains.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Slightly different reaction conditions afforded two distinct cavity&#8208;shaped cis&#8208;chelating diphosphanes from the same starting materials, namely diphenyl(2&#8208;phosphanylphenyl)phosphane and an &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;derived dimesylate. Thanks to their metal confining properties, the two diphosphanes form only mononuclear [CuX(PP)] complexes (X = Cl, Br, or I) with the tricoordinated metal ion located just above the center of the cavity. The two series of CuI complexes display markedly different luminescence properties that are both influenced by the electronic properties of the ligand and the unique steric environment provided by the cyclodextrin (CD) cavity. The excited state lifetimes of all complexes are significantly longer than those of cavity&#8208;free analogues suggesting peculiar electronic effects that affect radiative deactivation constants.

         <title>Gd3TeBO9: A Rare&#8208;Earth Borate with Significant Magnetocaloric Effect</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gadolinium&#8208;based oxide Gd3TeBO9 with high Gd content and excellent magnetocaloric effect is described.







Abstract
Magnetic refrigeration technology based on Gd&#8208;based paramagnets is expected to be applied to refrigeration in extremely low temperatures, thereby reducing the consumption of liquid helium. Here, we obtained a compound, Gd3TeBO9 with high Gd3+ concentration through element substitution. The Gd3+ concentration in this compound is as high as 2.4&#215;1024&#8197;ions/kg, which is 33&#8201;% higher than the commercial Gd3Ga5O12 (GGG), and further magnetic tests show that Gd3TeBO9 has a large magnetic entropy change (57.44&#8197;J/(kg&#8201;K) and 408&#8197;mJ/(cm3&#8201;K) at 2.6&#8197;K and 7&#8197;T), which is 1.5&#8197;times that of GGG, implying the possibility of its further development as an potential magnetocaloric material.

         <title>Hauser&#8208;Kraus Annulation Initiated Multi&#8208;Cascade Reactions for Facile Access to Functionalized and Fused Oxazepines, Carbazoles and Phenanthridinediones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Advancing on track. Several nitrogen&#8208;containing aromatic heterocycles such as dihydrobenzo[d]naphthooxazepine, benzo[a]carbazole and benzo[j]phenanthridine&#8208;7,12&#8208;dione are accessible by a base mediated reaction of 3&#8208;olefinic oxindole with 3&#8208;nucleophilic phthalide. This cascade synthesis involved several regioselective steps such as Hauser&#8208;Kraus annulation, ring cleavage (C&#8722;C&#963;), ring expansion, ring opening and ring contraction reactions in one pot. The formation of a new compound at every stage of the reaction by forming multiple new chemical bonds while proceeding to the title compound is another highlight of this reaction sequence. Further, the transformation generates stable and isolable medium rings. The complete mechanism of the reaction was rationalized by isolating and converting all stable intermediates to target compounds and by control experiments.







Abstract
The Hauser&#8208;Kraus (H&#8722;K) annulation of N&#8208;unsubstituted 3&#8208;olefinic oxindoles with 3&#8208;nucleophilic phthalides triggers a cascade of ring expansion and ring contraction reactions through several regioselective steps in one pot. While oxazepines were isolated in the presence of stoichiometric amounts of base at room temperature, carbazoles and phenanthridinediones were the products in the presence of excess base and microwave irradiation. Mechanistic studies guided by stepwise reactions and control experiments revealed that the isolable oxazepine intermediate, formed via ring expansion of the H&#8722;K adduct, is the key precursor to carbazole and phenanthridinedione via decarboxylative regioselective cyclizations.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Allylic Alcohols via Substrate Control on Asymmetric Lithiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sparteine free Hoppe&#8211;Matteson&#8211;Aggarwal rearrangement was applied to various chiral acetonides. Utilizing different vinyl boronic esters a high level of substrate control was observed leading to excellent selectivities. These selectivities were attributed to stereoelectronic effects of the neighboring acetonide moiety. The obtained formal Felkin and anti&#8208;Felkin products feature up to four contiguous stereocenters representing structural motifs common in natural products.







Abstract
Allylic alcohols are a privileged motif in natural product synthesis and new methods that access them in a stereoselective fashion are highly sought after. Toward this goal, we found that chiral acetonide&#8208;protected polyketide fragments performing the Hoppe&#8211;Matteson&#8211;Aggarwal rearrangement in the absence of sparteine with high yields and diastereoselectivities rendering this protocol a highly valuable alternative to the Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Takai&#8211;Kishi reaction. Various stereodyads and &#8208;triads were investigated to determine their substrate induction. The mostly strong inherent stereoinduction was attributed to a combination of steric and electronic effects.

         <title>Ultrathin Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanosheets for Selective Photocatalytic C2H2 Semihydrogenation in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports an ultrathin MOF sheets (Cu&#8208;Co&#8208;MNSs) catalyst for selectively semihydrogenation of C2H2 into C2H4. Under C2H2 atmosphere, visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photocatalytic C2H2 hydrogenation in aqueous solution was achieved with TONC2H4 of 2124 and 99.5&#8201;% selectivity for C2H4. Even under competitive conditions (1.10&#8197;vol&#8201;% C2H4 in C2H2), Cu&#8208;Co&#8208;MNSs can reduce the concentration of C2H2 to 5&#8197;ppm with 90.3&#8201;% selectivity for C2H4 over C2H6, proved its potential for application in polymer&#8208;grade ethylene production.







Abstract
The selective semihydrogenation of C2H2 to C2H4 in crude C2H4 (with ~1&#8197;vol&#8201;% C2H2 contamination) is a crucial process in the manufacture of polyethylene. Comparing to conventional thermalcatalytic route with Pd as catalyst under high temperature with H2 as hydrogen source, photocatalytic C2H2 reduction reaction with H2O as hydrogen source can achieve high selectivity under milder conditions, but has rarely been reported. Here, we present a kind of ultrathin metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheets (Cu&#8208;Co&#8208;MNSs) that demonstrate excellent catalytic activities in the semihydrogenation of C2H2. Employing Ru(bpy)32+ as the photosensitizer, this catalyst attains a noteworthy turnover number (TON) of 2124 for C2H4, coupled with an impressive selectivity of 99.5&#8201;% after 12&#8197;h visible light irradiation. This performance is comparable to molecular catalysts and notably surpasses the efficiency of bulk metal&#8211;organic framework materials. Furthermore, Cu&#8208;Co&#8208;MNSs achieve a 99.95&#8201;% conversion of C2H2 under industrial relevant conditions (1.10&#8201;% C2H2 in C2H4) with 90.3&#8201;% selectivity for C2H4 over C2H6, demonstrating a great potential for polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 production.

Pentafulvene&#8208;containing dyes: The cyclic cross&#8208;conjugated disposition of pentafulvenes creates a distinctive electron system, making them an exciting class of organic compounds. They attracted significant attention because of their propensity to display non&#8208;benzenoid aromatic properties. Synthesis of a series of such pentafulvene&#8208;containing compounds was easily achieved by the reaction of spiro[4.4]nonane in an acidic medium under metal&#8208;free conditions. Moreover, the synthesis of various functionalized spiro[4.4]nonanes was achieved by the reaction of dimethylacetylenedicarboxylate (DMAD) with 2&#8208;(2&#8242;&#8208;ketoalkyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208; indandiones in the presence of a catalytic amount of 1,4&#8208;Diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) as an organo&#8208;catalyst.

         <title>Carbodiimide and Isocyanate Hydroboration by a Cyclic Carbodiphosphorane Catalyst
</title>

         <dc:description>
A cyclic carbodiphosphorane catalyzes the hydroboration of carbodiimide and isocyanate substrates. DFT calculations support a mechanism involving activation of pinacolborane by the carbodiphosphorane catalyst, followed by hydride transfer and B&#8722;N bond formation.







Abstract
We report hydroboration of carbodiimide and isocyanate substrates catalyzed by a cyclic carbodiphosphorane catalyst. The cyclic carbodiphosphorane outperformed the other Lewis basic carbon species tested, including other zerovalent carbon compounds, phosphorus ylides, an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, and an N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin. Hydroborations of seven carbodiimides and nine isocyanates were performed at room temperature to form N&#8208;boryl formamidine and N&#8208;boryl formamide products. Intermolecular competition experiments demonstrated the selective hydroboration of alkyl isocyanates over carbodiimide and ketone substrates. DFT calculations support a proposed mechanism involving activation of pinacolborane by the carbodiphosphorane catalyst, followed by hydride transfer and B&#8722;N bond formation.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Amphoteric Reactivity of an Iron&#8208;Bispidine Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transient iron(III)&#8208;superoxido species in disguise orchestrates the reactivity of an iron(III)&#8208;alkylperoxido complex stabilized in an engineered bispidine scaffold.







Abstract
The reactivity of FeIII&#8208;alkylperoxido complexes has remained a riddle to inorganic chemists owing to their thermal instability and impotency towards organic substrates. These iron&#8208;oxygen adducts have been known as sluggish oxidants towards oxidative electrophilic and nucleophilic reactions. Herein, we report the synthesis and spectroscopic characterization of a relatively stable mononuclear high&#8208;spin FeIII&#8208;alkylperoxido complex supported by an engineered bispidine framework. Against the notion, this FeIII&#8208;alkylperoxido complex serves as a rare example of versatile reactivity in both electrophilic and nucleophilic reactions. Detailed mechanistic studies and computational calculations reveal a novel reaction mechanism, where a putative superoxido intermediate orchestrates the amphoteric property of the oxidant. The design of the backbone is pivotal to convey stability and reactivity to alkylperoxido and superoxido intermediates. Contrary to the well&#8208;known O&#8722;O bond cleavage that generates an FeIV&#8208;oxido species, the FeIII&#8208;alkylperoxido complex reported here undergoes O&#8722;C bond scission to generate a superoxido moiety that is responsible for the amphiphilic reactivity.
