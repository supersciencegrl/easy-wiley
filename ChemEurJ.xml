      <title>Triphenylphosphine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks and Heterogeneous Rh&#8208;P&#8208;COFs Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>The synthesis of phosphine&#8208;based functional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has attracted great attention recently. Here, we present two examples of triphenylphosphine&#8208;based COFs (termed as P&#8208;COFs) with well&#8208;defined crystalline structures, high specific surface areas and good thermal&#160;stability. Furthermore, the rhodium catalysts using the obtained P&#8208;COFs as support materials show high turnover frequency (TOF) for the hydroformylation of olefins, as well as the excellent recycling performance. This work not only extended phosphine&#8208;based COFs family, but also demonstrated their application in immobilizing homogeneous metal&#8208;based (e.g., Rh&#8208;phosphine) catalysts for heterogeneous catalysis application.</dc:description>

      <title>Oxidized Hemithioindigo Photoswitches &#8208; Influence of Oxidation State on (Photo)physical and Photochemical Properties</title>
      <dc:description>The photophysical and photochemical properties of sulfoxide and sulfone derivatives of hemithioindigo photoswitches are scrutinized and compared to the unoxidized parent chromophores. Oxidation results in significantly blue&#8208;shifted absorptions and mostly reduction of photochromism while thermal stabilities of individual isomers remain largely unaltered. Effective photoswitching takes place at shorter wavelengths compared to parent hemithioindigos and high isomeric yields can be obtained reversibly in the respective photostationary states. Reversible solid state photoswitching is observed for a twisted sulfone derivative accompanied by visible color changes. These results establish oxidized hemithioindigo photoswitches as promising and versatile tools for robust light&#8208;control of molecular behavior for a wide range of applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Dual Acting Small&#8208;Molecule Inhibitors Targeting Mycobacterial DNA Replication</title>
      <dc:description>Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a pathogenic bacterium and a causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), a disease that kills more than 1.5 million people worldwide annually. One of the main reasons for this high mortality rate is the evolution of new Mtb strains that are resistant to available antibiotics. Therefore, new therapeutics for TB are in constant demand. Here we report the development of such inhibitors that target two DNA replication enzymes of Mtb, namely DnaG primase and DNA gyrase, which share a conserved TOPRIM fold near the inhibitors&#8217; binding site. The molecules were developed on the basis of previously reported inhibitors for T7 DNA primase that bind near the TOPRIM fold. In order to improve the physicochemical properties of the molecules as well as their inhibitory effect on primase and gyrase, 49 novel compounds were synthesized as potential drug candidates in three stages of optimization. The last stage of chemical optimization yielded two novel inhibitors for the fast&#8208;growing nonpathogenic model Mycobacterium smegmatis (Msmg).</dc:description>

      <title>(Iso)Quinoline&#8208;Artemisinin Hybrids via Click Chemistry: Highly Potent Agents against Viruses</title>
      <dc:description>Viral infections cause life&#8208;threatening diseases in millions of people worldwide every year and there is urgent need for new effective antiviral drugs. Hybridization of two chemically diverse compounds into a new bioactive effector product is a successful concept to improve the hybrid drug&#8217;s properties compared to its parent compounds. In this study, (iso)quinoline&#8208;artemisinin hybrids, obtained via copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) or organocatalyzed click reactions (in organic solvents or in the presence of water), were analyzed in vitro for the first time for their inhibitory activity against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), as compared with their parent compounds and the reference drug ganciclovir. EC50 (HCMV) values were obtained in a range 0.22&#8208;1.20 &#181;M, indicating highly potent antiviral properties in the absence of cytotoxic effects on normal cells (CC50 &gt;100 &#181;M). The most active hybrid 1 (EC50 = 0.22 &#181;M) is 25 times more potent than its parent compound artesunic acid (EC50 = 5.41 &#181;M) and 12 times more efficient than the standard drug ganciclovir (EC50 = 2.6 &#181;M). Interestingly, hybrid 1 shows also inhibitory activity against hepatitis B virus in vitro (EC50 (HBeAg) = 2.57 &#181;M).</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Viral infections cause life&#8208;threatening diseases in millions of people worldwide every year and there is urgent need for new effective antiviral drugs. Hybridization of two chemically diverse compounds into a new bioactive effector product is a successful concept to improve the hybrid drug&#8217;s properties compared to its parent compounds.

      <title>Breast cancer stem cell potency of nickel(II)&#8208;polypyridyl complexes containing non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs</title>
      <dc:description>We report the breast cancer stem cell (CSC) potency of two nickel(II)&#8208;3,4,7,8&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline complexes,  1  and  3, containing the non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), naproxen and indomethacin, respectively. The nickel(II) complexes,  1  and  3  kill breast CSCs and bulk breast cancer cells in the micromolar range. Notably,  1  and  3  display comparable or better potency towards breast CSCs than salinomycin, an established CSC&#8208;active agent. The complexes,  1  and  3  also display significantly lower toxicity towards non&#8208;cancerous epithelial breast cells than breast CSCs or bulk breast cancer cells (up to 4.6&#8208;fold). Mechanistic studies suggest that  1  and  3  downregulate cyclooxygenase&#8208;2 (COX&#8208;2) in breast CSCs and kill breast CSCs in a COX&#8208;2 dependent manner. Furthermore, the potency of  1  and  3  towards breast CSCs decreased upon co&#8208;treatment with necroptosis inhibitors (necrostatin&#8208;1 and dabrafenib), implying that  1  and  3  induce necroptosis, an ordered form of necrosis, in breast CSCs. As apoptosis resistance is a hallmark of CSCs, compounds like  1  and  3, which potentially provide access to alternative (non&#8208;apoptotic) cell death pathways could hold the key to overcoming hard&#8208;to&#8208;kill CSCs. To the best of our knowledge,  1  and  3  are the first compounds to be associated to COX&#8208;2 inhibition and necroptosis induction in CSCs.</dc:description>

      <title>Flexible RuII Schiff base complexes: G&#8208;quadruplex DNA binding and photo&#8208;induced cancer cell death</title>
      <dc:description>A series of new RuII Schiff base complexes built on the salphen moiety has been prepared. This includes four flexibile monometallic RuII compounds and six rigid bimetallic analogues that contain NiII, PdII or PtII cations into the salphen complexation site. Steady state luminescence titrations illustrated the capacity of the compounds to photoprobe G&#8208;quadruplex DNA. Moreover, the vast array of the Schiff base structural changes allowed to extensively assess the influence of the ligand surface, flexibility and charge on the interaction of the compounds with G&#8208;quadruplex DNA. This was achieved thanks to circular dichroism melting assays and bio&#8208;layer interferometry studies that pointed up high affinities along with good selectivities of RuII Schiff base complexes for G4 DNA. In cellulo studies were carried out with the most promising compounds. Cellular uptake with location of the compounds in the nucleus as well as in the nucleolus was observed. Cell viability experiments were performed with U2OS osteosarcoma cells in the dark and under light irradiation which allowed the measurements of IC50&#8217;s and photoindexes. They showed the substantial role played by light irradiation in the activity of the drugs in addition to the low cytotoxicity of the molecules in the dark. Altogether, the reported results emphasize the promising properties of RuII Schiff base complexes as a new class of candidates for developing potential G4 DNA targeting diagnostic or therapeutic compounds.</dc:description>

      <title>Hydrazone&#8208;Linked Heptazine Polymeric Carbon Nitrides for Synergistic Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
Synergistic effects: A novel and environmentally friendly method for preparing heptazine&#8208;based mesoporous polymeric carbon nitrides with hydrazone links formed through a simple Schiff base condensation and their photocatalytic activity in the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol is presented.







Abstract
Heptazine&#8208;based conjugated polymeric carbon nitrides (PCNs) are promising metal&#8208;free photocatalysts, yet their synthesis is challenging due to the electron&#8208;deficiency and insolubility of heptazine units. Indeed, heptazine&#8208;containing polymers have only been prepared through nucleophilic substitution with amines by using toxic cyameluric chloride as the starting material. Herein, we report the novel and environmentally friendly method for preparing heptazine&#8208;based mesoporous PCNs with hydrazone links formed through a simple Schiff base condensation of melem&#8208;NH2 and aldehydes. Unlike cyameluric chloride, melem&#8208;NH2 is non&#8208;toxic, stable, and can be readily obtained from melem and hydrazine in solution. We demonstrate that the hydrazone linkages and the heptazine units synergistically enhance the photocatalytic activity of PCNs in visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. In particular, the polymer constructed from melem&#8208;NH2 and p&#8208;phthalaldehyde shows 17&#8197;times more activity than graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4).

      <title>Phosphate Ion&#8208;Functionalized CoS with Hexagonal Bipyramid Structures from Metal&#8208;Organic Framework: Bifunctionality towards Supercapacitors and Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>To solve energy&#8208;related environmental problems and energy crisis, efficient electrochemical materials have been developed as alternative energy storage and conversion systems. Abundant transition metals and their sulfides are attractive electrochemical materials. Herein, we reported an efficient phosphorization strategy, which improved the overall electrochemical performance of metal sulfides. In detail, CoS hexagonal bipyramids were synthesized through simple calcination combined with  in situ  sulfurization of a cobalt&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework template, and then phosphate ion&#8208;functionalized CoS (P&#8208;CoS) was prepared through a phosphorization reaction. P&#8208;CoS exhibited outstanding electrochemical activity as a bifunctional material,  i.e.  both supercapacitor electrode and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst. Supercapacitors based on CoS and P&#8208;CoS as the electrodes had high specific capacitances of 304 and 442 F g  &#8208;1  respectively, and remained stable after over 10000 cycles at 5 A g  &#8208;1  . For OER, P&#8208;CoS has a current density of 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  at overpotential of 340 mV, with a small Tafel slope.

      <title>Aqueous flow reactor and vapour&#8208;assisted synthesis of

aluminium dicarboxylate metal&#8208;organic frameworks with tuneable

water sorption properties</title>
      <dc:description>Energy&#8208;efficient indoors temperature and humidity control

can be realised using the reversible adsorption and desorption of

water in porous materials. Stable microporous aluminium&#8208;based

metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) present promising water sorption

properties for this goal. The development of synthesis routes that

make use of available and affordable building blocks and avoid the

use of organic solvents is crucial to advance this field. In this work,

two scalable synthesis routes under mild reaction conditions were

developed for aluminium&#8208;based MOFs: (1) in aqueous solutions

using a continuous flow reactor and (2) through the vapour&#8208;assisted

conversion of solid precursors. Fumaric acid, its methylated

analogue mesaconic acid, as well as mixtures of the two were used

as linkers to obtain polymorph materials with tuneable water sorption

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Energy&#8208;efficient indoors temperature and humidity control

can be realised using the reversible adsorption and desorption of

water in porous materials. Stable microporous aluminium&#8208;based

metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) present promising water sorption

properties for this goal. The development of synthesis routes that

make use of available and affordable building blocks and avoid the

use of organic solvents is crucial to advance this field. In this work,

two scalable synthesis routes under mild reaction conditions were

developed for aluminium&#8208;based MOFs: (1) in aqueous solutions

using a continuous flow reactor and (2) through the vapour&#8208;assisted

conversion of solid precursors. Fumaric acid, its methylated

analogue mesaconic acid, as well as mixtures of the two were used

as linkers to obtain polymorph materials with tuneable water sorption

properties. The synthesis conditions determine the crystal structure

and either the MIL&#8208;53 or MIL&#8208;68 type structure with square&#8208;grid or

kagome&#8208;grid topology, respectively, is formed. Fine&#8208;tuning resulted

in new MOF materials thus far inaccessible through conventional

synthesis routes. Furthermore, by varying the linker ratio, the water

sorption properties can be continuously adjusted while retaining the

      <title>The mechanism of the intramolecular hydrocarbyl metathesis within a planar triruthenium cluster &#8211; combining core flexibility with hydride mobility</title>
      <dc:description>The formation and cleavage of C&#8208;C bonds is of utmost importance in synthetic chemistry. While most of the existing homogeneous catalysts are mononuclear, knowledge of the behavior of polynuclear species is much more limited. By using computational methods, here we shed light into the mechanism of the thermally induced isomerization of Cp*3Ru3(&#956;&#8208;H)2(&#956;3&#8208;&#951;2&#8208;pentyne)(&#956;3&#8208;pentylidyne) (2) into Cp*3Ru3(&#956;&#8208;H)2(&#956;3&#8208;&#951;2&#8208;octyne)(&#956;3&#8208;ethylidyne) (3), a process that involves the migration of a C3  fragment between the hydrocarbyl ligands and across the plane formed by the three Ru centers. Our results show this to be a complex transformation that comprises of five individual rearrangements in an  A&#8208;B&#8208;A&#8208;B&#8208;A  order. Each rearrangement A  consists of the CH migration from the &#956;3&#8208;&#951;2&#8208;alkyne into the &#956;3&#8208;alkylidine ligand in the other side of the Ru3  plane. This process is facilitated by the cluster&#8217;s ability to adopt open&#8208;core structures in which one Ru&#8208;Ru bond is broken and a new C&#8208;C bond is formed. On the contrary, rearrangements B  do not involve the formation of C&#8208;C bonds nor do they require the opening of the cluster core. Instead, they consist of the isomerization of the &#956;3&#8208;&#951;2&#8208;alkyne and &#956;3&#8208;alkylidyne ligands on each side of the Ru&#8323; plane into &#956;3&#8208;alkylidyne and &#956;3&#8208;&#951;2&#8208;alkyne, respectively. This implies the migration of three H atoms within the hydrocarbyl ligands, and it is aided by the cluster&#8217;s ability to behave as a H reservoir. All in all, this study highlights the plasticity of these structures, whereby Ru&#8208;Ru, Ru&#8208;C, Ru&#8208;H, C&#8208;C, and C&#8208;H bonds are formed and broken with surprising ease.</dc:description>

      <title>Enhanced the electrochemical performance of high voltage LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4&#160;cathode in carbonate based electrolyte by a novel and low cost functional additive</title>
      <dc:description>Butyric anhydride (BA) is used as an effective functional additive to improve the electrochemical performance of high voltage LiNi  0.5  Mn  1.5  O  4  (LNMO) cathode. In presence of 0.5 wt.% BA, the capacity retention of LNMO/Li cell is significantly improved from 15.3 % to 88.4 % after 200 cycles at 1 C. Furthermore, the rate performance of LNMO/Li cell is also effectively enhanced and the capacity is up to 112 m Ah g  &#8208;1  even at 5 C, which is considerably higher than that LNMO/Li cell in electrolyte without BA additive (95.4 m Ah g  &#8208;1  at 5 C). Linear sweep voltammetry and cyclic voltammetry results reveal that the BA additive can be preferentially oxidized to construct a stable cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) film upon the LNMO cathode. Subsequently, the BA&#8208;derived CEI film can alleviate the decomposition of the electrolyte and the dissolution of Mn and Ni ions from LNMO cathode as well as maintain the structural stability of LNMO cathode during the cycling process, which leads to outstanding electrochemical performance. Therefore, this work provides an effective and low&#8208;cost functional electrolyte for high&#8208;voltage LNMO&#8208;based LIBs.</dc:description>

      <title>Recent Advances in Iodine&#8208;promoted C&#8208;S/N&#8208;S Bonds Formation</title>
      <dc:description>Sulfur&#8208;containing scaffold, as a ubiquitous structural motif, has been frequently used in natural products, bioactive chemicals and pharmaceuticals, particularly C&#8208;S/N&#8208;S bonds are indispensable in many biological important compounds and pharmaceuticals. Development of mild and general methods for C&#8208;S/N&#8208;S bonds formation has great significance in modern research. Iodine and its derivatives have been recognized as inexpensive, environmentally&#8208;benign and easy&#8208;handled catalysts or reagents to promote the construction of C&#8208;S/N&#8208;S bonds under mild reaction conditions, with good regioselectivities and broad substrate scope.

      <title>Electronic Finetuning of 8&#8208;Methoxy Psoralens by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling: Acidochromicity and Solvatochromicity</title>
      <dc:description>
A diverse and colorful library of novel psoralens can be obtained by cross&#8208;coupling reactions of 5&#8208;bromo&#8208;8&#8208;methoxypsoralen, which was prepared by a novel multistep synthesis. Photophysical properties, such as emission solvatochromicity and acidochromicity make this class of functional chromophores particularly attractive.







Abstract
Differently 5&#8208;substituted 8&#8208;methoxypsoralens can be synthesized by an efficient synthetic route with various cross&#8208;coupling methodologies, such as Suzuki, Sonogashira and Heck reaction. Compared to previously synthesized psoralens, thereby promising daylight absorbing compounds as potentially active agents against certain skin diseases can be readily accessed. Extensive investigations of all synthesized psoralen derivatives reveal fluorescence in the solid state as well as several distinctly emissive derivatives in solution. Donor&#8208;substituted psoralens exhibit remarkable photophysical properties, such as high fluorescence quantum yields and pronounced emission solvatochromicity and acidochromicity, which were scrutinized by Lippert&#8211;Mataga and Stern&#8211;Volmer plots. The results indicate that the compounds exceed the limit of visible light, a significant factor for potential applications as an active agent. In addition, (TD)DFT calculations were performed to elucidate the underlying electronic structure and to assign experimentally obtained data.

      <title>A Phosphinine&#8208;Derived 1&#8208;Phospha&#8208;7&#8208;Bora&#8208;Norbornadiene: Frustrated Lewis Pair Type Activation of Triple Bonds</title>
      <dc:description>
Just like an FLP: A hetero&#8208;norbornadiene incorporating phosphorus and boron atoms is accessible by a facile salt metathesis procedure. Although this compound represents a classical Lewis acid&#8211;base adduct, its reactivity is reminiscent of frustrated Lewis pairs. Reactions with nitriles and alkynes afford unusual insertion and 1,4&#8208;addition products. In both cases, reversible P&#8722;B bond dissociation is of key mechanistic significance.







Abstract
Salt metathesis of 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triphenylphosphacyclohexadienyl lithium and chlorobis(pentafluorophenyl)borane affords a 1&#8208;phospha&#8208;7&#8208;bora&#8208;norbornadiene derivative 2. The C&#8801;N triple bonds of nitriles insert into the P&#8722;B bond of 2 with concomitant C&#8722;B bond cleavage, whereas the C&#8801;C bonds of phenylacetylenes react with 2 to form &#955;4&#8208;phosphabarrelenes. Even though 2 must formally be regarded as a classical Lewis adduct, the C&#8801;N and C&#8801;C activation processes observed (and the mild conditions under which they occur) are reminiscent of the reactivity of frustrated Lewis pairs. Indeed, NMR and computational studies give insight into the mechanism of the reactions and reveal the labile nature of the phosphorus&#8211;boron bond in 2, which is also suggested by detailed NMR spectroscopic studies on this compound. Nitrile insertion is thus preceded by ring opening of the bicycle of 2 through P&#8722;B bond splitting with a low energy barrier. By contrast, the reaction with alkynes involves formation of a reactive zwitterionic methylphosphininium borate intermediate, which readily undergoes alkyne 1,4&#8208;addition.

      <title>Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced Heptacene Generation under Ambient Conditions: Utilization of Single&#8208;crystal Interior as an Isolated Reaction Site</title>
      <dc:description>The photo&#8208;induced generation of unstable molecules generally requires stringent conditions to prevent oxidation and the concomitant decomposition of the products. The visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced conversion of two heptacene precursors to heptacene was studied. Single crystals of bis&#8208; and mono&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diketone&#8208;type heptacene precursors (  7&#8208;DK2&#160;  and  &#160;7&#8208;DK1  , respectively), were prepared to investigate the effect of precursor structure on reactivity. The photoirradiation of a&#160;  7&#8208;DK2  &#160;single crystal cleaved only one &#945;&#8208;diketone group, forming an intermediate bearing a pentacene subunit, while that of a&#160;  7&#8208;DK1  &#160;single crystal gave rise to characteristic absorption peaks of heptacene and their increase in intensity with photoirradiation time, indicating the generation of heptacene without decomposition. Heptacene production was not observed when the precursors were photoirradiated in solution, implying that the single crystal interior provided isolation from the external environment, thus preventing heptacene oxidation.</dc:description>

      <title>Unusual Structures of the Parent Molecules Diarsene, Distibene, and Dibismuthene. Toward Their Observation</title>
      <dc:description>There is considerable interest, from both experimental and theoretical perspectives, in molecules incorporating multiple bonds between main group elements. Herein, we not only consider the parent molecules HE=EH (E = As, Sb, Bi), but also a number of their isomers. For each E2 H2 molecule, a number of different structures were optimized with four different DFT methods. Final structures were determined with the coupled cluster method CCSD(T) using large basis sets, namely cc&#8208;pVQZ&#8208;PP, incorporating relativistic psuedopotentials. All feasible dissociation pathways are examined. For all three E2H2 molecules the trans isomer lies lowest in energy, with the cis isomer higher by 2.7 (As), 2.1 (Sb), and 1.8 (Bi) kcal/mol, respectively. However, both cis and trans structures should be observable, as large barriers (27.7, 20.5, and 17.7 kcal/mol) separate them. For both the cis and tran s structures, in the infrared the strong E&#8208;H stretching frequencies should also be observable. Only the cis structures have dipole moments (0.62, 0.01, and 0.83 debye, respectively), and their observation by microwave spectroscopy would be stunning. Also considered were the higher energy vinylidene&#8208;like, pyramidal, monobridged, and linear structures. We conclude that molecules such as HSb=SbH&#8208;Fe(CO)4, HBi=BiH&#8208;Fe(CO)4, and related systems, should be feasible synthetic targets.</dc:description>

      <title>Multipolar Porphyrin&#8208;Triazatruxene Arrays for Two&#8208;Photon Fluorescence Cell Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>Two&#8208;photon excited fluorescent (TPEF) materials are highly desirable for bioimaging applications owing to their unique characteristics of deep&#8208;tissue penetration and high spatiotemporal resolution. Herein, by connecting one, two, or three electron&#8208;deficient zinc porphyrin units to an electron&#8208;rich triazatruxene core via ethynyl &#960;&#8208;bridges, conjugated multipolar molecules  TAT&#8208;(ZnP)  n  (n = 1&#8208;3) were developed as TPEF materials for cell imaging. The three new dyes present high fluorescence quantum yields (0.40&#8208;0.47) and rationally improved two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) properties. In particular, the peak TPA cross section of  TAT&#8208;ZnP  (436 GM) is significantly larger than that of the  ZnP  reference (59 GM). The  &#948;  TPA  values of  TAT&#8208;(ZnP)  2  and  TAT&#8208;(ZnP)  3  further increase to 1031 and up to 1496 GM respectively, indicating the effect of incorporated ZnP units on the TPA properties. The substantial improvement of the TPEF properties is attributed to the formation of &#960;&#8208;conjugated quadrapole/octupole molecules and the extension of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;D systems, which has been rationalized by density function theory (DFT) calculations. Moreover, all of the three new dyes display good biocompatibility and preferential targeting ability toward cytomembrane, thus can be superior candidates for TPEF imaging of living cells. Overall, this work demonstrated a promising strategy for the development of porphyrin&#8208;based TPEF materials by the construction and extension of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;D multipolar array.</dc:description>

Overall, this work demonstrated a promising strategy for the development of porphyrin&#8208;based TPEF materials by the construction and extension of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;D multipolar array.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Boronate Covalent and Hybrid Organic Frameworks Featuring P(III) and P=O Lewis Base Sites</title>
      <dc:description>Two covalent organic frameworks comprising Lewis basic P(III) centers and Lewis acidic boron atoms were prepared by poly&#8208;condensation reactions of newly obtained tris(4&#8208;diisopropoxyborylphenyl)phosphine with 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene and 2,3,6,7&#8208;tetrahydroxy&#8208;9,10&#8208;dimethylanthracene. Obtained materials exhibit significant sorption of dihydrogen (100 cm3g&#8208;1 at 1 bar at 77 K), methane (20 cm3g&#8208;1 at 1 bar at 273 K) and carbon dioxide (50 cm3g&#8208;1 at 1 bar at 273 K). They were exploited as solid&#8208;state ligands for coordination of Pd(0) centers. Alternatively, in bottom&#8208;up approach, boronated phosphine was treated with Pd2dba3 and poly&#8208;condensated yielding hybrid materials where the polymer networks are formed by means of covalent boronate linkages and coordination P&#8211;Pd bonds. In addition, the analogous materials based on phosphine oxide were synthesized. The DFT calculations on framework&#8208;guest interactions revealed that the behavior of adjacent boron and phosphorus/phosphine oxide centers is reminiscent of that found in Frustrated Lewis Pairs and may improve sorption of selected molecules.</dc:description>

      <title>Partially fluorinated copolymers as oxygen sensitive 19F MRI agents</title>
      <dc:description>19  F magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an promising emerging imaging modality. Specifically, the inherent sensitivity of the spin&#8208;lattice relaxation time (  T  1  ) of  19  F nuclei to oxygen partial pressure makes  19  F MRI an attractive non&#8208;invasive approach to quantify tissue oxygenation in a spatiotemporal manner. There remain, however, few materials with the adequate sensitivity to be used as oxygen&#8208;sensitive  19  F MRI agents. Herein, we report highly fluorinated monomers that provide a platform to realize water&#8208;soluble, partially fluorinated copolymers as  19  F MRI agents with the required sensitivity to quantify solution oxygenation at clinically relevant magnetic field strengths. The synthesis of a systematic library of partially fluorinated copolymers enabled a comprehensive evaluation of copolymer structure&#8211;property relationships relevant to  19  F MRI. The highest&#8208;performing material composition demonstrated a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio that corresponded to an apparent  19  F density of 220 mM, which surpasses the threshold of 126 mM  19  F required for visualization on a three Tesla clinical MRI. Furthermore, the  T  1  of these high performing materials demonstrated a linear relationship with solution oxygenation, with oxygen sensitivity reaching 240&#215;10  &#8208;5  mmHg  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  .

      <title>FeIII and FeII Phosphasalen Complexes: Synthesis, Characterization, and Catalytic Application for 2&#8208;Naphtol Oxidative Coupling</title>
      <dc:description>We report on the synthesis and characterization of three iron(III) phosphasalen complexes,  [Fe  III  (Psalen)(X)]  differing in the nature of the counter&#8208;anion/exogenous ligand (X  &#8208;  = Cl  &#8208;  , NO  3  &#8208;  , OTf  &#8208;  ), as well as the neutral iron(II) analogue,  [Fe  II  (Psalen)]  . Phosphasalen (Psalen) differs from salen by the presence of iminophosphorane (P=N) functions in place of the imines. All the complexes were characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, UV&#8208;vis, EPR, and cyclic voltammetry. The [Fe  II  (Psalen)] complex was shown to remain tetracoordinated even in coordinating solvent but exhibits surprisingly a magnetic moment in line with a Fe  II  high spin ground state. For the Fe  III  complexes, the higher lability of triflate anion compared to nitrate was demonstrated. As they exhibit lower reduction potentials compared to their salen analogues, these complexes were tested for the coupling of 2&#8208;naphtol using O  2  from air as oxidant. In order to shed light on this reaction, the interaction between 2&#8208;napthol and the Fe  III  (Psalen) complexes was studied by cyclic voltammetry as well as UV&#8208;vis spectrosocopy.</dc:description>

      <title>Selective Release of Doxorubicin from Cucurbit[8]uril Stabilized Gold Supra&#8208;pyramid&#160;Host at pH of Small Intestine</title>
      <dc:description>Gold supra&#8208;pyramid structures were obtained by the addition of acidic solution of cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) to an aqueous solution of citrate stabilized gold nanoparticles (AuNP). The reaction resulted in the precipitation of supra&#8208;pyramid from the solution just after 1 min of shaking. Microscopic images confirmed formation of supra&#8208;pyramid. The stepwise structural transformation towards supra&#8208;pyramid was examined with variable concentration of CB[8] to AuNP solution. Anionic counter parts of these acids (Br&#8211;, NO3&#8211;, SO42&#8211;&#160;and Cl&#8211;) controlled the size of the synthesized supra&#8208;pyramids. These supra&#8208;pyramid hosts showed uptake of three anticancer drugs: oral drugs etoposide, prednisolone and intravenous drug doxorubicin. Releases of drugs from these hosts were emulated at acidic stomach pH, basic small intestinal pH and in presence of human serum albumin (HSA). The specific release of doxorubicin was confirmed at small intestinal pH 7.4. Poor release of drugs in presence of CB[8] specific guest 1&#8208;adamantanamine confirmed the role of supra&#8208;pyramid as exclusive host.

      <title>Highly Elastic Slide&#8208;Ring Hydrogel with Good Recovery as Stretchable Supercapacitor</title>
      <dc:description>As a new material with excellent mechanical properties and good stability, slide&#8208;ring gels have attracted more and more attention and research. However, it cannot be widely used due to its relatively complicated synthesis. Herein, we use 6&#8211;acrylamidomethylether&#8208;modified &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#945;CDAAmMe) and PEG 20000 diacrylate (PEG 20000 DA) to construct a polypseudorotaxane. Then, the polypseudorotaxane reacts with acrylamide via a photo&#8208;initiated polymerization in&#8208;situ to conveniently obtain a slide&#8208;ring hydrogel with good elastic property and high recovery property. That is, the hydrogel can be easily stretched to 22.5 times of its original length but recovered rapidly and almost reversibly. These results enable the application of hydrogel to make an intrinsically stretchable and compressible supercapacitor after doping ions and the adhesion of commercially available carbon nanotube (CNT) paper as electrodes, giving the ionic conductivity as 17.0 mS/cm (comparable to that of the commercial PVA/H3PO4 electrolyte) and the capacitance as 0.87 uF/cm2 (at the scan speed of 100 mV/s), and its capacitance can be further enhanced under the stretching.</dc:description>

      <title>Unraveling Benignant Microstructure Evolution in Pyrite for Boosted Lithium Storage Performance</title>
      <dc:description>Pyrite FeS2 as a high&#8208;capacity electrode material for lithium ion batteries (LIBs) is hindered by its unstable cycling performance due to the large volume change and irreversible phase segregation from coarsening of Fe. Here, we unravel the benignant microstructure evolution in MoS2&#8208;modified FeS2 as an anode for LIBs during the cycling process that is responsible for its significantly boosted lithium storage performances. Specifically, the FeS2/MoS2 displays a long cycle life with a capacity retention of 116% after 600 cycles at 0.5 A g&#8208;1, which is the best among the reported FeS2&#8208;based materials so far. A series of electrochemical tests and structural characterizations substantially revealed that the introduced MoS2 in FeS2 experiences an irreversible electrochemical reaction and thus the in&#8208;situ formed metallic Mo could act as the conductive buffer layer to accelerate the dynamics of Li+ diffusion and electron transport. More importantly, it can guarantee the highly reversible conversion in lithiated FeS2 by preventing Fe coarsening. This work provides a fundamental understanding and an effective strategy towards the microstructure evolution for boosting lithium storage performances for other metal sulfide&#8208;based materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Separating Growth from Nucleation for Facile Control over the Size and Shape of Palladium Nanocrystals</title>
      <dc:description>In order to maximize the performance of nanocrystals in a specific application, it is necessary to control both their size and shape. Here we report a one&#8208;pot protocol that allows us to separate growth from nucleation for achieving better controls over the size and shape of Pd nanocrystals. The two processes are temporally separated from each other, although the synthesis is carried out in the same reaction container. Size control is achieved by simply varying the ratio between the amounts of precursor allocated to the growth and nucleation processes. With the involvement of seeds at a fixed number, increasing the amount of precursor for growth leads to increasingly larger nanocrystals. Shape control is made possible by varying the capping agent, with bromide leading to a cubic shape and citrate inducing the formation of an octahedral shape. The synthesis can also be scaled up by at least 10&#8208;fold without compromising the quality.</dc:description>

      <title>The &#8220;Inverted Bonds&#8221; Revisited: Analysis of &#8220;In Silico&#8221; Models and of [1.1.1]Propellane by Using Orbital Forces
</title>
      <dc:description>
Inverted or not? &#8220;In silico&#8221; models and molecular orbital analysis by using dynamic orbital forces (DOFs) lead to the conclusion that the so&#8208;called &#8220;inverted bond&#8221; in propellane (&#963; bond resulting from overlap of the smaller lobes of sp hybrids) has an energy close to zero. The bonding is only due to &#960;&#8208;type interactions with an energy of about 50&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1.







Abstract
This article dwells on the nature of &#8220;inverted bonds&#8221;, which refer to the &#963; interaction between two sp hybrids by their smaller lobes, and their presence in [1.1.1]propellane. Firstly, we study H3C&#8722;C models of C&#8722;C bonds with frozen H&#8208;C&#8208;C angles reproducing the constraints of various degrees of &#8220;inversion&#8221;. Secondly, the molecular orbital (MO) properties of [1.1.1]propellane and [1.1.1]bicyclopentane are analyzed with the help of orbital forces as a criterion of bonding/antibonding character and as a basis to evaluate bond energies. Triplet and cationic states of [1.1.1]propellane species are also considered to confirm the bonding/antibonding character of MOs in the parent molecule. These approaches show an essentially non&#8208;bonding character of the &#963; central C&#8722;C interaction in propellane. Within the MO theory, this bonding is thus only due to &#960;&#8208;type MOs (also called &#8220;banana&#8221; MOs or &#8220;bridge&#8221; MOs) and its total energy is evaluated to approximately 50&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. In bicyclopentane, despite a strong &#963;&#8208;type repulsion, a weak bonding (15&#8211;20&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) exists between both central C&#8722;C bonds, also due to &#960;&#8208;type interactions, though no bond is present in the Lewis structure. Overall, the so&#8208;called &#8220;inverted&#8221; bond, as resulting from a &#963; overlap of the two sp hybrids by their smaller lobes, appears highly questionable.

      <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembly is a process in which a disordered system spontaneously develops ordered structures without external directions. In materials science and technology, self&#8208;assembly in the bulk has been extensively utilized to fabricate desired microscopic structures. Rodlike molecules have emerged as one of the most promising molecular building blocks to construct functional materials. Although the self&#8208;assembly of conventional molecules containing rodlike components generally results in nematic or layered smectic phases, extensive efforts have revealed that rational molecular design provides a versatile platform to engineer rich self&#8208;assembled structures. In their Review article on page&#8197;6741&#8197;ff., Feng, Lin and Cheng et&#8197;al. summarize the first successes achieved in polyphilic liquid crystals and rod&#8211;coil block systems. Special attention is paid to recent progress in the conjugation of rodlike building blocks with other molecular building blocks through the molecular Lego approach.

Chemical synthesis based on solution&#8208;phase reactions has attracted much attention in the synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) owing to its potential to achieve the desired size, morphology, structure, and magnetic controls. In their Minireview article on page&#8197;6757&#8197;ff., B. Shen and S.

As an efficient structural &#8220;instrument&#8221; for stabilization of both open&#8208;shell and ionic states of diaryl nitroxides, the &#945;&#8208;methylcyclopropyl group with conformationally dependent electronic properties is suggested. Conformational switching of the cyclopropyl orientation relatively to the adjacent aromatic &#960; system as dependent on the nitroxide's redox state, are confirmed by DFT calculations and experimental results.

      <title>Chemical Synthesis of Magnetic Nanoparticles for Permanent Magnet Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Hard magnetic nanomaterials: Chemical synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles has received great attention owing to its advantages, which lead to the desired control of the magnetic properties. This Minireview highlights recent developments in the chemical synthesis of hard magnetic nanoparticles and exchange&#8208;coupled nanocomposites for permanent magnet applications.







Abstract
Permanent magnets are a class of critical materials for information storage, energy storage, and other magneto&#8208;electronic applications. Compared with conventional bulk magnets, magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) show unique size&#8208;dependent magnetic properties, which make it possible to control and optimize their magnetic performance for specific applications. The synthesis of MNPs has been intensively explored in recent years. Among different methods developed thus far, chemical synthesis based on solution&#8208;phase reactions has attracted much attention owing to its potential to achieve the desired size, morphology, structure, and magnetic controls. This Minireview focuses on the recent chemical syntheses of strongly ferromagnetic MNPs (Hc&gt;10&#8197;kOe) of rare&#8208;earth metals and FePt intermetallic alloys. It further discusses the potential of enhancing the magnetic performance of MNP composites by assembly of hard and soft MNPs into exchange&#8208;coupled nanocomposites. High&#8208;performance nanocomposites are key to fabricating super&#8208;strong permanent magnets for magnetic, electronic, and energy applications.

      <title>Triquinoline vs Fullerene based cycloparaphenylene ionic complexes. Comparison of photoinduced charge&#8208;shift reactions.</title>
      <dc:description>A triquinoline cationic moiety (TQ&#8226;H+) has recently been designed as a novel molecular unit for supramolecular chemistry. In addition to some useful features, TQ&#8226;H+ has strong electron acceptor properties which make the molecular cation to be a unique element in nano&#8208;chemistry. TQ&#8226;H+ is found to form complexes with coronene (COR) and cycloparaphenylene (CPP). In this work, we report a computational study of photoinduced electron transfer (PET) in supramolecular complexes TQ&#8226;H+&#8211;COR, TQ&#8226;H+&#8834;[12]CPP and (TQ&#8226;H+&#8211;COR)&#8834;[12]CPP. The electron transfer rates are estimated by using the semi&#8208;classical approach. The calculation results are compared with the data previously obtained for a structurally similar inclusion complex Li+@C60&#8834;[10]CPP. In particular, we find a red solvatochromic shift for charge&#8208;shift bands in the TQ&#8226;H+&#8208;complexes unlike a blue shift showed by Li+@C60&#8834;[10]CPP. This distinction is explored in terms of electronic and structural features of the systems.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs) provide a rich source of potential targets for drug discovery and biomedical science research.  However, the identification of structural&#8208;diverse starting points for discovery of PPI inhibitors remains a significant challenge.

      <title>Novel Fluorescent Labeled Octasilsesquioxanes Nanohybrids as Potential Materials for Latent Fingerprinting Detection</title>
      <dc:description>The recent demand for fluorescent labeled materials (FLMs) in forensic security concepts such as latent fingerprints (LFs) that encodes information for anti&#8208;counterfeiting and encryption of confidential data makes necessary the development of building new and innovative materials.

The excellent performance of the hetero&#8208;bifunctional FLM in the visualization of LF is emphasized by their legibility, selectivity, sensitivity and temporal photostability.

      <title>Catalytic activity of alkali metal cations for chemical oxygen reduction reaction in a biphasic liquid system probed by scanning electrochemical microscopy</title>
      <dc:description>Chemical reduction of dioxygen in organic solvents for the production reactive oxygen species or the concomitant oxidation of organic substrates can be enhanced in by separation of products and educts in biphasic liquid systems.

This interface is stabilized at the orifice of a pipette, across which a Galvani potential difference is externally applied and precisely adjusted in order to enforce the transfer of different alkali metal ions from the aqueous to the organic electrolyte. The oxygen reduction is followed by H  2  O  2  detection in the aqueous phase close to the interface by a microelectrode of a scanning electrochemical microscope (SECM).

      <title>Synthesis of chiral MOF&#8208;74 frameworks by post&#8208;synthetic modification using an amino acid</title>
      <dc:description>The synthesis of chiral metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is highly relevant for asymmetric heterogenous catalysis, yet very challenging. Chiral MOFs with MOF&#8208;74 topology were synthesized using post&#8208;synthetic modification with proline. Vibrational circular dichroism studies demonstrate that proline is the source of chirality. The solvents used in the synthesis play a key role in tuning the loading of proline and its interaction with the MOF&#8208;74 framework. In N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethylformamide, proline coordinates monodentate to the Zn  2+  ions within the MOF&#8208;74 framework, whilst it is only weakly bound to the framework when using methanol as solvent. Introducing chirality within the MOF&#8208;74 framework also leads to the formation of defects, with both the organic linker and metal ions missing from the framework. The formation of defects combined with the coordination of DMF and proline within the framework leads to a pore blocking effect. This is confirmed by adsorption studies and testing of the chiral MOFs in the asymmetric aldol reaction between acetone and  para  &#8208;nitrobenzaldehyde.</dc:description>

      <title>Flavonoids with Vicinal Hydroxyl Groups Inhibit Human Calcitonin Amyloid Formation</title>
      <dc:description>Human calcitonin (hCT) is a 32&#8208;residue peptide hormone that can aggregate into amyloid fibrils and cause cellular toxicity. In this study, we investigated the inhibition effects of a group of polyphenolic molecules on hCT amyloid formation. Our results suggest that the gallate moiety in epigallocatechin&#8208;3&#8208;gallate (EGCG), a well&#8208;recognized amyloid inhibitor, is not critical for its inhibition activity of the hCT amyloid formation. Our results demonstrate that the flavonoid compounds such as myricetin, quercetin, and baicalein that contain vicinal hydroxyl groups on the phenyl ring effectively prevent hCT fibrillization. This structural feature can also be applied to non&#8208;flavonoid polyphenolic inhibitors. Moreover, our results indicate a plausible mechanistic role of these vicinal hydroxyl groups which might include the oxidation to form a quinone and the subsequent Schiff base formation with the lysine or histidine residues of hCT. This may further disrupt the crucial electrostatic and aromatic interactions involved in the process of hCT amyloid fibril formation. The inhibition activity of the polyphenolic compounds against hCT fibril formation may likely be attributed to a combination of factors such as Schiff base formation, aromatic stacking, and hydrogen bonding interactions.</dc:description>

      <title>Simplified Synthesis of Biomass Derived Si/C Composite as a Stable Anode Material for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Synthesis of silicon/carbon (Si/C) by biomass resources enables the effective utilization of agricultural products in battery industries because of economical as well as environmental considerations. Herein, a simplified process was developed to synthesize Si/C from biomass, using low&#8208;cost agricultural by&#8208;products &#8220;rice husk (RH)&#8221; as a model. This process includes the calcination of RH for SiO2/C and the reduction of SiO2/C by Al in molten salts at a moderate temperature. This process does not need the removal of carbon before the thermal reduction of SiO  2  , which is thought to be very necessary to avoid the formation of SiC at elevated temperatures. So carbon derived from biomass can be directly used for Si/C as the anode material. The resultant Si/C shows a high reversible capacity of 1309 mAh g  &#8208;1  and long cycle life (300 cycles). Our research advocates a new and simplified strategy for the synthesis of RH&#8208;biomass&#8208;derived Si/C, which is beneficial for low&#8208;cost, environment&#8208;friendly and green energy storage applications.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Metal nanoclusters (NCs) have a particle size of about one nanometer, which makes them the smallest unit that can give a function to a substance.

Such publications have provided much insight into the effects of alloying on the electronic structure and function of metal NCs. However, the rapid increase in knowledge has made it difficult for researchers (especially those new to the field) to grasp all of it.

      <title>DNA&#8208;targeted NO release photoregulated by green light</title>
      <dc:description>We have designed and synthesized a novel molecular hybrid in which acridine orange (AO) is covalently linked to an N&#8208;nitrosoaniline derivative through an alkyl spacer. Photoexcitation of the AO antenna with the highly biocompatible green light results in intense fluorescence emission and triggers the NO detachment from the N&#8208;nitroso appendage  via  an intramolecular electron transfer. The presence of the AO moiety encourages the binding with DNA through both external and partially intercalative fashions, depending on the DNA:molecular hybrid molar ratio.

      <title>Water&#8208;soluble rhenium clusters with triazoles: the effect of chemical structure on cellular internalization and the DNA binding of the complexes</title>
      <dc:description>Here we explore the effect of the nature of organic ligands in rhenium cluster complexes [Re  6  Q  8  L  6  ]  4&#8208;  (where Q=S or Se, and L=benzotriazole, 1,2,3&#8208;triazole or 1,2,4&#8208;triazole) on the biological properties of the complexes, in particular on the cellular toxicity, cellular internalization and localization. Specifically, the paper describes the synthesis and detailed characterization of the structure, luminescence and electrochemical properties of the four new Re  6  clusters with 1,2,3&#8208; and 1,2,4&#8208;triazoles. Biological assays of these complexes are also discussed in addition to those with benzotriazole using cervical cancer (HeLa) and immortalized human fibroblasts (CRL&#8208;4025) as model cell lines. Our study demonstrates that the presence of hydrophobic and &#960;&#8208;bonding rich units such as the benzene ring in benzotriazole significantly enhances cellular internalization of rhenium clusters. These ligands facilitate binding of the clusters to DNA, which results in increased cytotoxicity of the complexes.</dc:description>

      <title>Controllable Synthesis of Fe&#8208;doped NiCo2O4 Nanobelts as Superior Catalysts for Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>As one of the promising clean and renewable technologies, water splitting has been a hot issue, especially the half&#8208;reaction of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to its sluggish and complex kinetics. Hence, the Fe&#8208;doped NiCo2O4 nanobelts were designed and prepared as catalysts toward OER. By increasing the Fe amount, the catalytic performances of the as&#8208;synthesized products went up and then decreased. Profiting from the synergistic effect between Fe atom and NiCo2O4, all the Fe&#8208;NiCo2O4 catalysts exhibited superior catalytic activities to the corresponding NiCo2O4. In addition, the characteristic nanobelt architecture facilitates the conduction of electrons and the exposure of active sites. With the optimal Fe content, the 9.1% Fe&#8208;NiCo2O4 yielded the smallest overpotential and Tafel slope among the catalysts, distinctly lower than that of RuO2.</dc:description>

      <title>Highly efficient transfer hydrogenation catalysis with tailored pyridylidene amide pincer ruthenium complexes</title>
      <dc:description>The rational optimization of homogeneous catalysts requires ligand platforms that are easily tailored to improve catalytic performance. Here, we demonstrate that pyridylidene amides (PYAs) provide such a platform to custom&#8208;shape transfer hydrogenation catalysts to exceptional activity. Specifically, a series of mesoionic PYA pincer ligands with differently substituted PYA units has been synthezised and coordinated to ruthenium(II) centres to form bench&#8208;stable&#160;complexes [Ru(R&#8208;PYA&#8208;pincer)(MeCN)  3  ](PF  6  )  2  &#160;(R&#160;= OMe, Me, H, Cl, CF  3  ). Analytic studies (NMR spectroscopy, electrochemistry, crystallography) reveal a direct influence of the substituents on the electronic properties of the ruthenium center. The complexes are active in the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of ketones, with activities directly encoded by the PYA substitution pattern. Their perfomance improves further upon exchange of an ancillary MeCN ligand with PPh  3  . While complexes [Ru(R&#8208;PYA&#8208;pincer)(PPh  3  )(MeCN)  2  ](PF  6  )  2  &#160;were only isolated for R = H, Me, an&#160;  in situ  &#160;protocol was developed to generate these complexes&#160;  in situ  &#160;for R = OMe, Cl, CF  3  &#160;by using a 1:2 ratio of the complexes and PPh  3  .

      <title>Importance of Methane Chemical Potential for Its Conversion to Methanol on Cu&#8208;Exchanged Mordenite</title>
      <dc:description>
Tricopper&#8208;oxo clusters [Cu3(&#956;&#8208;O)3]2+ hosted in mordenite can selectively oxidize methane to methanol but yields are limited. At standard pressure, one cluster reacts with one CH4 molecule. Elevated methane pressure increased the chemical potential of methane by enabling the activation of two CH4 molecules by two &#956;&#8208;O atoms out of the three contained in a [Cu3(&#956;&#8208;O)3]2+, thus doubling the yield of methanol.

      <dc:description>
Iridium, the &#8220;rainbow&#8221; element, is the element with the highest attainable formal oxidation state of +IX. The goal of this work was to produce neutral Ir+IXN3 by reacting excited iridium atoms with dinitrogen. This reaction leads to a cornucopia of iridium nitrogen compounds identified by FTIR spectroscopy under cryogenic conditions. Quantum chemical calculations give insight to their electronic structure. The product molecules are discussed with emphases on oxidation states and dinitrogen activation. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S.&#8197;Riedel et&#8197;al.

      <title>Multivariate Analysis of Coupled Operando EPR/XANES/EXAFS/UV&#8211;Vis/ATR&#8208;IR Spectroscopy: A New Dimension for Mechanistic Studies of Catalytic Gas&#8208;Liquid Phase Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Four eyes see more than two: Operando EPR, XANES/EXAFS, ATR&#8208;IR, and UV/Vis spectroscopy have been coupled in the same experiment to complete the mechanistic puzzle in selective aerobic alcohol oxidation by a copper&#8208;TEMPO catalyst. The reaction is driven by a single CuI/CuII redox cycle that activates O2 with the help of TEMPO. Dimeric CuII&#8211;CuII species have no catalytic impact since they dissolve in the early stage of the reaction without activity loss. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J. Rabeah, V. Briois, A. Br&#252;ckner, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202000436).

      <title>Magnetic Phase Transitions in a Ni4O4&#8208;Cubane&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
      <dc:description>
A remarkable Ni4O4&#8211;cubane&#8208;based coordination framework has been shown to display unusual low&#8208;temperature magnetic behavior. The 3D coordination network consists of perpendicular chains of NiII ions linked by 1,4&#8208;phenylene diacetate ligands and bridged by the Ni4O4&#8211;cubane units. It was found to undergo a magnetic ordering at &#8764;24&#8197;K into an antiferromagnetic or partially spin&#8208;compensated phase, but then to also display a pronounced magnetic hysteresis below &#8764;3&#8197;K. The authors conclude that this is due to a structural phase transition. More information can be found in the Full Paper by P. K&#246;gerler, J.&#8197;A. Stride, et&#8197;al.

      <title>Post&#8208;Metalation Modification of a Macrocyclic Dicobalt(III) Metallohost by Site&#8208;Selective Ligand Exchange for Guest Recognition Control</title>
      <dc:description>
Post&#8208;metalation modification based on ligand exchange on the metal centers is a useful strategy to control the guest recognition behavior of a metal&#8208;containing macrocyclic host. The two axial piperidine ligands at diagonal positions in the cobalt(III) dinuclear macrocyclic host, [LCo2(pip)4]2+ (pip=piperidine), were site&#8208;selectively replaced with pyridine or acetato ligands. The replacement with acetato ligands significantly enhanced the Na+ recognition ability. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Akine et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202001072).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Post&#8208;metalation modification &lt;/b&gt; based on ligand exchange on the metal centers is a useful strategy to control the guest recognition behavior of a metal&#8208;containing macrocyclic host. The two axial piperidine ligands at diagonal positions in the cobalt(III) dinuclear macrocyclic host, [LCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(pip)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (pip=piperidine), were site&#8208;selectively replaced with pyridine or acetato ligands. The replacement with acetato ligands significantly enhanced the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; recognition ability. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Akine et&#8197;al.

      <title>Enhancing the Activity of Drugs by Conjugation to Organometallic Fragments</title>
      <dc:description>
There is an urgent clinical need for new agents to treat microbial infections and cancer, especially to combat resistance to current drugs. The successful strategy of conjugating existing drugs to organometallic fragments is illustrated with examples of conjugated organometallic metallocene sandwich and half&#8208;sandwich complexes, especially ferrocene, RuII and OsII arene, and RhIII and IrIII cyclopentadienyl complexes.







Abstract
Resistance to chemotherapy is a current clinical problem, especially in the treatment of microbial infections and cancer. One strategy to overcome this is to make new derivatives of existing drugs by conjugation to organometallic fragments, either by an appropriate linker, or by direct coordination of the drug to a metal. We illustrate this with examples of conjugated organometallic metallocene sandwich and half&#8208;sandwich complexes, RuII and OsII arene, and RhIII and IrIII cyclopentadienyl half&#8208;sandwich complexes. Ferrocene conjugates are particularly promising. The ferrocene&#8211;chloroquine conjugate ferroquine is in clinical trials for malaria treatment, and a ferrocene&#8208;tamoxifen derivative (a ferrocifen) seems likely to enter anticancer trails soon. Several other examples illustrate that organometallic conjugation can restore the activity of drugs to which resistance has developed.

      <title>DMT1 Inhibitors Kill Cancer Stem Cells by Blocking Lysosomal Iron Translocation</title>
      <dc:description>
Blocked by iron: Inhibitors of the divalent metal transporter&#8197;1 (DMT1) have been identified that kill cancer stem cells by blocking lysosomal iron translocation. This leads to lysosomal iron accumulation, production of reactive oxygen species and cell death. Taken together, this provides opportunities for the development of new cancer treatment modalities involving DMT1 inhibitors.







Abstract
Cancer stem cells (CSC) constitute a cell subpopulation in solid tumors that is responsible for resistance to conventional chemotherapy, metastasis and cancer relapse. The natural product Salinomycin can selectively target this cell niche by directly interacting with lysosomal iron, taking advantage of upregulated iron homeostasis in CSC. Here, inhibitors of the divalent metal transporter&#8197;1 (DMT1) have been identified that selectively target CSC by blocking lysosomal iron translocation. This leads to lysosomal iron accumulation, production of reactive oxygen species and cell death with features of ferroptosis. DMT1 inhibitors selectively target CSC in primary cancer cells and circulating tumor cells, demonstrating the physiological relevance of this strategy. Taken together, this opens up opportunities to tackle unmet needs in anti&#8208;cancer therapy.

      <title>Consecutive Photoinduced Electron Transfer (conPET): The Mechanism of the Photocatalyst Rhodamine&#8197;6G</title>
      <dc:description>
Consecutive PET. The excitation of rhodamine&#8197;6G (R6G+) with green light (540&#8197;nm) in the presence of N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine generates two rhodamine radicals. Excitation of these radicals with blue light (420&#8197;nm) enables reduction of aromatic bromides. Femtosecond spectroscopy reveals that the lifetime of the excited state (350&#8197;fs) is too short for diffusion&#8208;controlled electron transfer, pointing to solvated electrons as intermediates.







Abstract
The dye rhodamine&#8197;6G can act as a photocatalyst through photoinduced electron transfer. After electronic excitation with green light, rhodamine&#8197;6G takes an electron from an electron donor, such as N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine, and forms the rhodamine&#8197;6G radical. This radical has a reduction potential of around &#8722;0.90&#8197;V and can split phenyl iodide into iodine anions and phenyl radicals. Recently, it has been reported that photoexcitation of the radical at 420&#8197;nm splits aryl bromides into bromide anions and aryl radicals. This requires an increase in reduction potential, hence the electronically excited rhodamine&#8197;6G radical was proposed as the reducing agent. Here, we present a study of the mechanism of the formation and photoreactions of the rhodamine&#8197;6G radical by transient absorption spectroscopy in the time range from femtoseconds to minutes in combination with quantum chemical calculations. We conclude that one photon of 540&#8197;nm light produces two rhodamine&#8197;6G radicals. The lifetime of the photoexcited radicals of around 350&#8197;fs is too short to allow diffusion&#8208;controlled interaction with a substrate. A fraction of the excited radicals ionize spontaneously, presumably producing solvated electrons. This decay produces hot rhodamine&#8197;6G and hot rhodamine&#8197;6G radicals, which cool with a time constant of around 10&#8197;ps. In the absence of a substrate, the ejected electrons recombine with rhodamine&#8197;6G and recover the radical on a timescale of nanoseconds. Photocatalytic reactions occur only upon excitation of the rhodamine&#8197;6G radical, and due to its short excited&#8208;state lifetime, the electron transfer to the substrate probably takes place through the generation of solvated electrons as an additional step in the proposed photochemical mechanism.

      <title>A visible&#8208;light&#8208;powered polymerization method for the immobilization of enantioselective organocatalysts into microreactors</title>
      <dc:description>A versatile one&#8208;step photopolymerization approach for the immobilization of enantioselective organocatalysts is presented. Chiral organocatalyst&#8208;containing monoliths based on polystyrene divinylbenzene copolymer were generated inside channels of microfluidic chips. Exemplary performance tests were performed for the monolithic Hayashi&#8208;J&#248;rgensen catalyst in continuous flow, which showed good results for the Michael addition of aldehydes to nitroalkenes in terms of stereoselectivity and catalyst stability with minimal consumption of reagents and solvents.</dc:description>

      <title>Alteration of the Conformational Dynamics of a DNA Hairpin by &#945;&#8208;Synuclein in the Presence of Aqueous Two&#8208;Phase Systems</title>
      <dc:description>We studied the effect of an amyloidogenic intrinsically disordered protein, &#945;&#8208;synuclein, which is associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), on the conformational dynamics of a DNA hairpin (DNA&#8208;HP) employing the single&#8208;molecule F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer method. The open&#8208;to&#8208;closed conforma&#173;tional equilibrium of the DNA&#8208;HP is drastically affected by binding of monomeric &#945;&#8208;synuclein to the loop region of the DNA&#8208;HP. Formation of a protein&#8208;bound intermediate conformation is fostered in the presence of an aqueous two&#8208;phase system mimicking intracellular liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation. Using pressure modulation, additional mechanistic informa&#173;tion of the binding complex could be retrieved. Hence, in addition to toxic amyloid formation, &#945;&#8208;synuclein may alter expression profiles of disease&#8208;modifying genes in PD. Further, these findings might also have significant bearings on the understanding of the physiology of organisms thriving at high pressures in the deep sea.</dc:description>
