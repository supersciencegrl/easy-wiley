         <title>Versatile near&#8208;infrared super&#8208;resolution imaging of amyloid fibrils with the fluorogenic probe CRANAD&#8208;2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CRANAD&#8208;2 is a fluorogenic curcumin derivative used for near&#8208;infrared detection and imaging in vivo of amyloid aggregates, which are involved in neurodegenerative diseases. We explore the performance of CRANAD&#8208;2 in two super&#8208;resolution imaging techniques, namely stimulated emission depletion (STED) and singlemolecule localization microscopy (SMLM), with markedly different fluorophore requirements. By conveniently adapting the concentration of CRANAD&#8208;2, which transiently binds to amyloid fibers, we show that it performs well in both techniques, achieving a resolution in the range of 45 &#8211; 55 nm. Correlation of SMLM with atomic force microscopy (AFM) validates the resolution of fine features in the reconstructed super&#8208;resolved image. The good performance and versatility of CRANAD&#8208;2 provides a powerful tool for near&#8208;infrared nanoscopic imaging of amyloids  in vitro  and  in vivo  .</dc:description>

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Chemoenzymatic Installation of Hydroxy&#8208;Bearing Allyl Moiety on the Indole Ring of Tryptophan&#8208;Containing Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The late&#8208;stage functionalization of indole&#8208; and tryptophan&#8208;containing compounds with reactive moieties facilitates downstream diversification and leads to changes in their biological properties. Here we describe the synthesis of two hydroxy&#8208;bearing allyl pyrophosphates. We demonstrate a chemoenzymatic method using a promiscuous indole prenyltransferase enzyme to install a dual reactive hydroxy&#8208;bearing allyl moiety directly on the indole ring of tryptophan&#8208;containing peptides. This is the first report of late&#8208;stage indole modifications with this reactive group.</dc:description>

         <title>Planar chiral rhodium complexes of 1,4&#8208;benzoquinones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diene rhodium complexes are important catalysts in modern organic synthesis. Herein, we report a new approach to the such complexes with the uncommon planar chirality. The synthesis is achieved by face&#8208;selective coordination of the prochiral 2,5&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinones (R2&#8208;Q) with rhodium precursors containing the chiral auxiliary ligand S&#8208;salicyl&#8208;oxazoline (S&#8208;Salox). Such coordination leads to the formation of (R,R&#8208;R2&#8208;Q)Rh(S&#8208;Salox) complexes in high yields and with exceptional diastereoselectivity (d.r. &gt; 20:1). Subsequent replacement of the auxiliary ligand provides various benzoquinone rhodium complexes with retention of the planar chirality. Combined theoretical and experimental studies show that due to their electron&#8208;withdrawing nature benzoquinones bind metals stronger than the related 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene, but weaker than other common diene ligands, such as cyclooctadiene.</dc:description>

         <title>Type S Non Ribosomal Peptide Synthetases for the rapid generation of tailormade peptide libraries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bacterial natural products in general, and non&#8208;ribosomally synthesized peptides in particular, are structurally diverse and provide us with a broad range of pharmaceutically relevant bioactivities. Yet, traditional natural product research suffers from rediscovering the same scaffolds and has been stigmatized as inefficient, time&#8208;, labour&#8208; and cost&#8208;intensive. Combinatorial chemistry, on the other hand, can produce new molecules in greater numbers, cheaper and in less time than traditional natural product discovery, but also fails to meet current medical needs due to the limited biologically relevant chemical space that can be addressed. Consequently, methods for the high throughput generation of new natural products would offer a new approach to identifying novel bioactive chemical entities for the hit to lead phase of drug discovery programms. As a follow&#8208;up to our previously published proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study on generating bipartite type S non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), we now envisaged the&#160;  de novo  &#160;generation of non&#8208;ribosomal peptides (NRPs) on an unreached scale. Using synthetic zippers, we split NRPS in up to three subunits and rapidly generated different bi&#8208; and tripartite NRPS libraries to produce 49 peptides, peptide derivatives, and&#160;  de novo  &#160;peptides at good titres up to 145 mg L  &#8208;1  . A further advantage of type S NRPSs not only is the possibility to easily expand the created libraries by re&#8208;using previously created type S NRPS, but that functions of individual domains as well as domain&#8208;domain interactions can be studied and assigned rapidly.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly sensitive &#8220;off/on&#8221; EPR probes to monitor enzymatic activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The assessment of unregulated level of enzyme activity is a crucial parameter for early diagnoses in a wide range of pathologies. In this study, we propose the use of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) as an easy method to probe carboxylesterase (CE) enzymatic activity  in vitro  . For this application, were synthesized two amphiphilic, nitroxide containing esters, namely  Tempo&#8208;C12  (T&#8208;C12) and  Tempo&#8208;2&#8208;C12  (T&#8208;2&#8208;C12). They exhibit low solubility in water and form stable micelles in which the radicals are EPR almost silent, but the hydrolysis of the ester bond yields narrows and intense EPR signals. The intensity of the EPR signals is proportional to the enzymatic activity. CEs1, CEs2 and esterase from porcine liver (PLE) were investigated. The obtained results show that T&#8208;C12&#8208; and T&#8208;2&#8208;C12&#8208;containing systems display a much higher selectivity toward the CEs2, with a Limit of Detection of the same order of those ones obtained with optical methods.</dc:description>

They exhibit low solubility in water and form stable micelles in which the radicals are EPR almost silent, but the hydrolysis of the ester bond yields narrows and intense EPR signals. The intensity of the EPR signals is proportional to the enzymatic activity. CEs1, CEs2 and esterase from porcine liver (PLE) were investigated. The obtained results show that T-C12- and T-2-C12-containing systems display a much higher selectivity toward the CEs2, with a Limit of Detection of the same order of those ones obtained with optical methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Characterization of Asx&#8208;turn types and their connate relationship with &#946;&#8208;turns</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Models of asparagine&#8208;containing dipeptides, specifically designed to favor intrinsic folding into an Asx&#8208;turn, were characterized both theoretically, using quantum chemistry, and experimentally, using laser spectroscopy in the gas phase. Both approaches provided evidence for the spontaneous folding of both the Asn&#8208;Ala and Asn&#8208;Gly dipeptide models into the most stable Asx&#8208;turn, a conformation stabilized by a C10 H&#8208;bond which was very similar to a type II&#8217; &#946;&#8208;turn. In parallel, analysis of the Asx&#8208;turns implicating asparagine in crystallized protein structures in the Protein Data Bank revealed a sequence&#8208;dependent behavior. In Asn&#8208;Ala sequences, the Asx&#8208;turn was found in conjunction with a type I &#946;&#8208;turn for which the first of the four defining residues was Asn. The observation that the Asx turn in these structures is mostly of type II&#8217; (  i.e.  its most stable innate structure) suggests that this motif may foster the formation and/or enhance the stability of the backbone &#946;&#8208;turn. In contrast, the Asx turns observed in Asn&#8208;Gly sequences extensively adopted a type II Asx&#8208;turn structure, suggesting that their formation should be ascribed to other factors, such as hydration. The fact that the Asx&#8208;turn in a Asn&#8208;Gly sequence is also often found in combination with a hydrated &#946;&#8208;bulge supports the premise that a Asn&#8208;Gly sequence might efficiently promote the formation of the &#946;&#8208;bulge secondary structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton or Carbene Transfer? On the Dark and Light Reaction of Diazoalkanes with Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
O&#8208;H Functionalization: In this combined experimental and computational study, the reaction of diaryl diazoalkanes with alcohols is reported. In the ground state, a direct proton transfer governs reactivity with acidic HFIP. On the contrary, photoexcitation leads to formation of a triplet carbene intermediate that undergoes an alcohol&#8208;assisted intersystem crossing to a solvent&#8208;stabilized carbene that results in high&#8208;yield photochemical O&#8722;H functionalization reactions.







Abstract
The formal alkylation reaction of OH groups with diazoalkanes under catalyst&#8208;free reaction conditions finds broad application in organic synthesis. However, even today, this reaction is mainly limited to the use of diazomethane as reaction partner. In this combined experimental and theoretical study, we aim at a fundamental understanding of the reaction of diazoalkanes with alcohols to make this transformation amenable to a generalized approach towards formal alkylation reactions of alcohols with diazoalkanes. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest a direct proton transfer only in exceptional cases. In a more general setting, such O&#8722;H functionalization proceed both under dark and photochemical conditions via a key hydrogen&#8208;bonded singlet carbene intermediate that undergoes a protonation&#8211;addition mechanism. We conclude with applications of this approach in O&#8722;H functionalization reactions of alcohols, including simple fluorinated, halogenated and aliphatic alcohols and showcase functional&#8208;group tolerance of this method in the reaction of biologically active and pharmaceutically relevant alcohols.

         <title>Highly Selective Lysine Acylation in Proteins Using a Lys&#8208;His Tag Sequence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A short, designed Lys&#8208;His tag can be inserted into proteins where it autocatalyzes the highly selective acylation of the Lys side&#8208;chain amine with phenyl esters. The reaction conditions of this site&#8208;selective, chemical protein modification method are mild, and no oxidative reagents, reductants nor enzymes are required.







Abstract
Chemical modification of proteins has numerous applications, but it has been challenging to achieve the required high degree of selectivity on lysine amino groups. Recently, we described the highly selective acylation of proteins with an N&#8208;terminal Gly&#8208;His6 segment. This tag promoted acylation of the N&#8208;terminal N&#945;&#8208;amine resulting in stable conjugates. Herein, we report the peptide sequences Hisn&#8208;Lys&#8208;Hism, which we term Lys&#8208;His tags. In combination with simple acylating agents, they facilitate the acylation of the designated Lys N&#1013;&#8208;amine under mild conditions and with high selectivity over native Lys residues. We show that the Lys&#8208;His tags, which are 7 to 10 amino acids in length and still act as conventional His tags, can be inserted in proteins at the C&#8208;terminus or in loops, thus providing high flexibility regarding the site of modification. Finally, the selective and efficient acylation of the therapeutic antibody Rituximab, pure or mixed with other proteins, demonstrates the scope of the Lys&#8208;His tag acylation method.

         <title>Elucidating the Germanium Distribution in ITQ&#8208;13 Zeolites by Density Functional Theory**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preferred Ge distributions in ITQ&#8208;13 silicogermanates with different Si/Ge ratios were investigated with electronic structure calculations, with the primary aim of predicting the most stable local structures across the range of Ge contents. Additional calculations were used to study the variation of the dynamic behaviour of the incorporated fluoride anions as a function of the local environment and the defluorination behaviour of different fluoride&#8208;containing cages.







Abstract
ITQ&#8208;13 is a medium&#8208;pore zeolite that can be prepared in all&#8208;silica form and as silicogermanate with Si/Ge ratios as low as 3. Usually synthesised in the presence of fluoride, ITQ&#8208;13 is among the very few systems containing fluoride anions in two distinct cage types, cube&#8208;like d4r units and [4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;56] cages. Here, dispersion&#8208;corrected density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to investigate the energetically most favourable Ge distributions for Si/Ge ratios between 55 and 6. The calculations show Ge atoms are incorporated at both the corners of d4r cages and at the basal plane of the [4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;56] cages, in accordance with 19F&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. Two Ge atoms at adjacent corners of [4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;56] cages are stable at the highest Ge content considered (Si/Ge=6). Such a local environment has not yet been considered in the experimental literature. A calculation of the corresponding 19F&#8197;NMR resonance points to overlap with other resonances, which might preclude its clear identification. Additional calculations investigate the variation of the dynamic behaviour of the fluoride anions as a function of the local environment as well as the selective defluorination of the [4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;56] cages.

         <title>Synthesis of Natural Products by C&#8722;H Functionalization of Heterocycless</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overview of the recent strategies towards the total synthesis of heterocyclic natural products enabled by C&#8722;H functionalization is presented. The review is focused on transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed approaches, such as palladium catalysis, gold catalysis, iridium and ruthenium catalysis, and also presents transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free radical strategies as well as electrophilic&#8208;type metal&#8208;free C&#8722;H functionalization reactions and direct deprotonation approaches driven by the properties of heterocycles. The implementation of C&#8722;H functionalization of heterocycles enables novel tactics in the construction of core architectures, while changing the logic design of retrosynthetic strategies and permitting access to natural product scaffolds with novel and enhanced biological activities.







Abstract
Total synthesis is considered by many as the finest combination of art and science. During the last decades, several concepts were proposed for achieving the perfect vision of total synthesis, such as atom economy, step economy, or redox economy. In this context, C&#8722;H functionalization represents the most powerful platform that has emerged in the last years, empowering rapid synthesis of complex natural products and enabling diversification of bioactive scaffolds based on natural product architectures. In this review, we present an overview of the recent strategies towards the total synthesis of heterocyclic natural products enabled by C&#8722;H functionalization. Heterocycles represent the most common motifs in drug discovery and marketed drugs. The implementation of C&#8722;H functionalization of heterocycles enables novel tactics in the construction of core architectures, but also changes the logic design of retrosynthetic strategies and permits access to natural product scaffolds with novel and enhanced biological activities.

         <title>Fibril Structure Demonstrates the Role of Iodine Labelling on a Pentapeptide Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iodination is an attractive yet minimal functionalization to engineer the self&#8208;assembly of amyloidogenic peptides. Despite having received little attention in the field, iodinated aliphatic residues can expand the library of functional moieties able to tune peptides self&#8208;assembly. In our work, a custom iodinated aliphatic amino acid was synthesized and introduced into a pentapeptide, enhancing its self&#8208;assembly and crystallogenic properties.







Abstract
Iodination has long been employed as a successful labelling strategy to gain structural insights into proteins and other biomolecules via several techniques, including Small Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering, Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP&#8208;MS), and single&#8208;crystal crystallography. However, when dealing with smaller biomolecular systems, interactions driven by iodine may significantly alter their self&#8208;assembly behaviour. The engineering of amyloidogenic peptides for the development of ordered nanomaterials has greatly benefitted from this possibility. Still, to date, iodination has exclusively been applied to aromatic residues. In this work, an aliphatic bis&#8208;iodinated amino acid was synthesized and included into a custom pentapeptide, which showed enhanced fibrillogenic behaviour. Peptide single crystal X&#8208;ray structure and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction on its dried water solution demonstrated the key role of iodine atoms in promoting intermolecular interactions that drive the peptide self&#8208;assembly into amyloid fibrils. These findings enlarge the library of halogenated moieties available for directing and engineering the self&#8208;assembly of amyloidogenic peptides.

         <title>Heterodinuclear Mg(II)M(II) (M=Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn) Complexes for the Ring Opening Copolymerization of Carbon Dioxide/Epoxide and Anhydride/Epoxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of new heterodinuclear complexes comprising Mg(II)M(II) are reported as highly efficient catalysts for both the ROCOP of CO2/cyclohexene oxide and norbornene anhydride/cyclohexene oxide. Mg(II)Co(II) and Mg(II)Fe(II) were the most effective combinations in the catalysis.







Abstract
The catalysed ring opening copolymerizations (ROCOP) of carbon dioxide/epoxide or anhydride/epoxide are controlled polymerizations that access useful polycarbonates and polyesters. Here, a systematic investigation of a series of heterodinuclear Mg(II)M(II) complexes reveals which metal combinations are most effective. The complexes combine different first row transition metals (M(II)) from Cr(II) to Zn(II), with Mg(II); all complexes are coordinated by the same macrocyclic ancillary ligand and by two acetate co&#8208;ligands. The complex syntheses and characterization data, as well as the polymerization data, for both carbon dioxide/cyclohexene oxide (CHO) and endo&#8208;norbornene anhydride (NA)/cyclohexene oxide, are reported. The fastest catalyst for both polymerizations is Mg(II)Co(II) which shows propagation rate constants (kp) of 34.7&#8197;mM&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 (CO2) and 75.3&#8197;mM&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 (NA) (100&#8201;&#176;C). The Mg(II)Fe(II) catalyst also shows excellent performances with equivalent rates for CO2/CHO ROCOP (kp=34.7&#8197;mM&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) and may be preferable in terms of metallic abundance, low cost and low toxicity. Polymerization kinetics analyses reveal that the two lead catalysts show overall second order rate laws, with zeroth order dependencies in CO2 or anhydride concentrations and first order dependencies in both catalyst and epoxide concentrations. Compared to the homodinuclear Mg(II)Mg(II) complex, nearly all the transition metal heterodinuclear complexes show synergic rate enhancements whilst maintaining high selectivity and polymerization control. These findings are relevant to the future design and optimization of copolymerization catalysts and should stimulate broader investigations of synergic heterodinuclear main group/transition metal catalysts.

Pre&#8208;existing conditions play a critical role in disease progression after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. In this study, we sought to unravel the underlying mechanisms related to the interactions between peptides relevant to type II diabetes mellitus and Parkinson's disease and the G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;forming sequence RG&#8208;1 of the viral RNA.







Abstract
Given the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome&#8208;coronavirus&#8208;2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2), which particularly threatens older people with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus and dementia, understanding the relationship between Covid&#8208;19 and other diseases is an important factor for treatment. Possible targets for medical intervention include G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4Qs) and their protein interaction partners. We investigated the stability and conformational space of the RG&#8208;1 RNA&#8208;G&#8208;quadruplex of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 N&#8208;gene in the presence of salts, cosolutes, crowders and intrinsically disordered peptides, focusing on &#945;&#8208;Synuclein and the human islet amyloid polypeptide, which are involved in Parkinson's disease (PD) and type&#8208;II diabetes mellitus (T2DM), respectively. We found that the conformational dynamics of the RG&#8208;1 G4Q is strongly affected by the various solution conditions. Further, the amyloidogenic peptides were found to strongly modulate the conformational equilibrium of the RG&#8208;1. Considerable changes are observed with respect to their interaction with human telomeric G4Qs, which adopt different topologies. These results may therefore shed more light on the relationship between PD as well as T2DM and the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 disease and their molecular underpinnings. Since dysregulation of G4Q formation by rationally designed targeting compounds affects the control of cellular processes, this study should contribute to the development of specific ligands for intervention.

         <title>BBr3&#8208;Mediated P(III)&#8208;Directed C&#8722;H Borylation of Phosphines</title>

Boron Chemistry. An efficient metal&#8208;free system has been uncovered for the site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H borylation of phosphines directed by P(III) atom just using BBr3. This robust method enables the rapid construction of phosphine boronate esters in selective, practical, low&#8208;cost, and environmentally friendly modes.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H borylation has been widely used in the preparation of organoboron compounds. Here, we developed a general protocol on metal&#8208;free P(III)&#8208;directed C&#8722;H borylation of phosphines mediated by BBr3, resulting in the formation of products bearing both phosphorus and boron. The development of the metal&#8208;free strategy to mimic previous metallic processes has shown low cost, superior practicality, and environmental friendliness. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate the preferred pathway for this metal&#8208;free directed C&#8722;H borylation process.

An efficient metal-free system has been uncovered for the site-selective C&#8722;H borylation of phosphines directed by P(III) atom just using BBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. This robust method enables the rapid construction of phosphine boronate esters in selective, practical, low-cost, and environmentally friendly modes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transition-metal-catalyzed C&#8722;H borylation has been widely used in the preparation of organoboron compounds. Here, we developed a general protocol on metal-free P(III)-directed C&#8722;H borylation of phosphines mediated by BBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, resulting in the formation of products bearing both phosphorus and boron. The development of the metal-free strategy to mimic previous metallic processes has shown low cost, superior practicality, and environmental friendliness. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate the preferred pathway for this metal-free directed C&#8722;H borylation process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrostatic Perturbations in the Substrate&#8208;Binding Pocket of Taurine/&#945;&#8208;Ketoglutarate Dioxygenase Determine its Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 9, February 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Density functional theory calculations on large active site models of taurine/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate dioxygenase show that second&#8208;coordination sphere effects of polar and charged amino acid residues are essential for the correct description of the regioselectivity of taurine activation by this enzyme. In particular, a charged histidine residue incurs a local electric field effect that guides the reactivity to C1&#8208;hydroxylation.







Abstract
Taurine/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate dioxygenase is an important enzyme that takes part in the cysteine catabolism process in the human body and selectively hydroxylates taurine at the C1&#8208;position. Recent computational studies showed that in the gas&#8208;phase the C2&#8722;H bond of taurine is substantially weaker than the C1&#8722;H bond, yet no evidence exists of 2&#8208;hydroxytaurine products. To this end, a detailed computational study on the selectivity patterns in TauD was performed. The calculations show that the second&#8208;coordination sphere and the protonation states of residues play a major role in guiding the enzyme to the right selectivity. Specifically, a single proton on an active site histidine residue can change the regioselectivity of the reaction through its electrostatic perturbations in the active site and effectively changes the C1&#8722;H and C2&#8722;H bond strengths of taurine. This is further emphasized by many polar and hydrogen bonding interactions of the protein cage in TauD with the substrate and the oxidant that weaken the pro&#8208;R C1&#8722;H bond and triggers a chemoselective reaction process. The large cluster models reproduce the experimental free energy of activation excellently.

         <title>Highly Regioselective Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Transfer Hydrodeuteration of Unactivated Terminal Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 9, February 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precision deuteration of unactivated alkenes: A copper&#8208;catalyzed alkene transfer hydrodeuteration for the synthesis of precisely deuterated small molecules is described. It is the most regio&#8208; and chemoselective transfer hydrodeuteration of unactivated terminal alkenes reported to date. The transformation was performed across a broad scope of substrates and even demonstrated on two natural product derivatives.







Abstract
Catalytic transfer hydrodeuteration of unactivated alkenes is challenging because of the requirement that chemically similar hydrogen and deuterium undergo selective insertion across a &#960;&#8208;bond. We now report a highly regioselective catalytic transfer hydrodeuteration of unactivated terminal alkenes across a variety of heteroatom&#8208; or heterocycle&#8208;containing substrates. The base&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed reaction is also demonstrated on two complex natural products. Reaction studies indicate modular conditions that can also be extended to perform either an alkene transfer hydrogenation or transfer deuteration.

         <title>Probing the Lewis Acidity of Boronic Acids through Interactions with Arene Substituents</title>

Boronic acids. Hammett analysis of 2,6&#8208;diarylphenylboronic acids reveals that their Lewis acidity remains unchanged upon the introduction of EWG/EDG at the distant para position of the flanking aromatic rings. Structural and computational studies demonstrate that polar&#8208;&#960; interactions and solvation effects contribute to the stabilization of boronic acids and boronate forms by aromatic rings, providing a valuable molecular insight into the rational design of novel catalysts and inhibitors.







Abstract
Boronic acids are Lewis acids that exist in equilibrium with boronate forms in aqueous solution. Here we experimentally and computationally investigated the Lewis acidity of 2,6&#8208;diarylphenylboronic acids; specially designed phenylboronic acids that possess two flanking aromatic rings with tunable aromatic character. Hammett analysis of 2,6&#8208;diarylphenylboronic acids reveals that their Lewis acidity remains unchanged upon the introduction of EWG/EDG at the distant para position of the flanking aromatic rings. Structural and computational studies demonstrate that polar&#8208;&#960; interactions and solvation effects contribute to the stabilization of boronic acids and boronate forms by aromatic rings. Our physical&#8208;organic chemistry work highlights that boronic acids and boronates can be stabilized by aromatic systems, leading to an important molecular knowledge for rational design and development of boronic acid&#8208;based catalysts and inhibitors of biomedically important proteins.

Abstract
Anomeric base pairs in heterochiral DNA with strands in the &#945;&#8208;d and &#946;&#8208;d configurations and homochiral DNA with both strands in &#945;&#8208;d configuration were functionalized.

Nucleosides were protected and converted to phosphoramidites. Solid&#8208;phase synthesis furnished 12&#8208;mer oligonucleotides, which were hybridized. Pyrene click adducts display fluorescence, a few of them with excimer emission.

Clickable side chains and bulky click adducts are well accommodated in the grooves of anomeric DNA.

         <title>Evidence for Charge Delocalization in Diazafluorene Ligands Supporting Low&#8208;Valent [Cp*Rh] Complexes**

4,5&#8208;Diazafluorene&#8208;based ligands are notable analogues of the workhorse 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyls, but little is known about their ability to stabilize reduced organometallic complexes. Here, synthetic, structural, and electrochemical studies of [Cp*Rh] complexes bearing 9,9&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;diazafluorene (Me2daf) and related analogues have been used to show that Me2daf can stabilize electron&#8208;rich species through &#960;&#8208;backbonding and concomitant charge delocalization. In light of this, Me2daf can be concluded to be a promising building block for applications in reductive chemistry and catalysis.







Abstract
Ligands based upon the 4,5&#8208;diazafluorene core are an important class of emerging ligands in organometallic chemistry, but the structure and electronic properties of these ligands have received less attention than they deserve. Here, we show that 9,9&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;diazafluorene (Me2daf) can stabilize low&#8208;valent complexes through charge delocalization into its conjugated &#960;&#8208;system. Using a new platform of [Cp*Rh] complexes with three accessible formal oxidation states (+III, +II, and +I), we show that the methylation in Me2daf is protective, blocking Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;base chemistry commonly encountered with other daf&#8208;based ligands. Electronic absorption spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of a family of eleven new compounds, including the unusual Cp*Rh(Me2daf), reveal features consistent with charge delocalization driven by &#960;&#8208;backbonding into the LUMO of Me2daf, reminiscent of behavior displayed by the workhorse 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl ligand. Taken together with spectrochemical data demonstrating clean conversion between oxidation states, our findings show that 9,9&#8242;&#8208;dialkylated daf&#8208;type ligands are promising building blocks for applications in reductive chemistry and catalysis.

         <title>Revisiting the Fundamental Nature of Metal&#8208;Ligand Bonding: An Impartial and Automated Fitting Procedure for Angular Overlap Model Parameters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 9, February 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In Ligand Field Theory, the angular overlap model (AOM) can in principle describe the electron donor/acceptor capabilities of individual ligands. However, its applicability is limited by the nature of the spectroscopic data. We present a computational approach for automated AOM parameter fitting and investigate metal&#8211;halide bonds that had previously been described only heuristically. This approach is applied to a 2D spectrochemical series, for which a linear relationship between AOM parameters and the chemical hardness of the ligands is found.







Abstract
The properties and reactivities of transition metal complexes are often discussed in terms of Ligand Field Theory (LFT), and with ab initio LFT a direct connection to quantum chemical wavefunctions was recently established. The Angular Overlap Model (AOM) is a widely used, ligand&#8208;specific parameterization scheme of the ligand field splitting that has, however, been restricted by the availability and resolution of experimental data. Using ab initio LFT, we present here a generalised, symmetry&#8208;independent and automated fitting procedure for AOM parameters that is even applicable to formally underdetermined or experimentally inaccessible systems. This method allows quantitative evaluations of assumptions commonly made in AOM applications, for example, transferability or the relative magnitudes of AOM parameters, and the response of the ligand field to structural or electronic changes. A two&#8208;dimensional spectrochemical series of tetrahedral halido metalates ([MIIX4]2&#8722;, M=Mn&#8722;Cu) served as a case study. A previously unknown linear relationship between the halide ligands&#8217; chemical hardness and their AOM parameters was found. The impartial and automated procedure for identifying AOM parameters introduced here can be used to systematically improve our understanding of ligand&#8211;metal interactions in coordination complexes.

         <title>Comparative Study of Nitro&#8208; and Azide&#8208;Functionalized ZnII&#8208;Based Coordination Polymers (CPs) as Fluorescent Turn&#8208;On Probes for Rapid and Selective Detection of H2S in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 9, February 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the reduction approach, newly synthesized coordination polymers (CPs) containing biologically essential metal ion (Zn) was shown to exhibit an excellent ability for the detection of extracellular and intracellular H2S. The CP&#8208;1, containing azido functunal group acted as an efficient fluorencent turn&#8208;on probe with lowest detection limit (7.2&#8197;&#956;M) and shortest response time (30&#8197;s) among the reported Zn&#8208;based probes to date, whereas the nitro group containing CP&#8208;2 was unable to sense H2S due to its framework disruption.







Abstract
Selective detection of H2S in the cellular systems using fluorescent CPs/MOFs is of great scientific interest due to their outstanding aqueous stability, biocompatibility and real&#8208;time detection ability. Fabrication of such materials using complete biologically essential elements and applying them as an efficient biosensor is still quite challenging. In this context, two newly synthesized CPs containing biologically essential metal ion (Zn) and nitro/azido functional groups into the framework to sense extracellular and intracellular H2S by reducing into respective amines are presented. The CP&#8208;1 containing the azide group acted as an efficient fluorescent turn&#8208;on probe with the lowest detection limit (7.2&#8197;&#956;M) and shortest response time (30&#8197;s) among the Zn&#8208;based probes reported till date. Moreover, CP&#8208;1 exhibited green luminescence in live cells after imaging a very low concentration of H2S, whereas the nitro analogue CP&#8208;2 could not detect the target analyte due to its framework disruption.

A new bi&#8208;functional ligand bearing chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and prolinol moieties is designed and applied in the generation of a Cu/Zn hetero&#8208;bimetallic complex, which unlocks the asymmetric allylic alkylation reactions of allyl phosphates with zinc keto&#8208;homoenolates generated from cyclopropanols, leading to the formation of various &#947;&#8208;vinyl ketones with good regio&#8208; and enantio&#8208;selectivity. DFT calculation supports that the chelation of allyl phosphates with catalyst promotes the SN2&#8217; addition and the ligand&#8208;substrate steric interactions account for the stereoselective outcome.

para&#8208;Alkynylated aromatic amines are obtained without the need to prefunctionalize the starting aniline by Pd/S,O&#8208;ligand catalyzed C&#8722;H alkynylation reactions.







Abstract
Herein, we report a nondirected para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H alkynylation of aniline derivatives by a Pd/S,O&#8208;ligand&#8208;based catalyst. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions and is compatible with a variety of substituted anilines. The scalability and further derivatizations of the alkynylated products have been also demonstrated.

Monosaccharides were introduced on drug molecules to improve their solubility, metabolic stability and oral bioavailability. A new chloromethyl glycoside synthon was developed to enable the synthesis of numerous monosaccharide prodrugs.







Abstract
This work investigates the addition of monosaccharides to marketed drugs to improve their pharmacokinetic properties for oral absorption. To this end, a set of chloromethyl glycoside synthons were developed to prepare a variety of glycosyloxymethyl&#8208;prodrugs derived from 5&#8208;fluorouracil, thioguanine, propofol and losartan. Drug release was studied in&#8197;vitro using &#946;&#8208;glucosidase confirming rapid conversion of the monosaccharide prodrugs to release the parent drug, formaldehyde and the monosaccharide. To showcase this prodrug approach, a glucosyloxymethyl conjugate of the tetrazole&#8208;containing drug losartan was used for in&#8197;vivo experiments and showed complete release of the drug in a dog&#8208;model.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Reductive Aldol Reaction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Carboxylic Acids to Alkyl Aryl Ketones: Silanes as Activator and Transient Protecting Group</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 9, February 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first reductive aldol reaction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids was developed in the presence of copper/bisphosphine catalysts. The reaction demonstrated the usability of in situ protection of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids by a hydrosilane for the reductive C&#8722;C bond formation. The Si&#8722;O bond in the aldol products is readily cleaved by a standard workup, showing the silane worked as not only an activator but also a transient protecting group.







Abstract
The first enantioselective reductive aldol reaction of unprotected &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids was developed by employing a copper/bisphosphine catalyst. The reaction features in situ protection and activation of an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acid by a hydrosilane. The copper enolate formed in situ reacts with an alkyl aryl ketone to afford the &#946;&#8208;hydroxy carboxylic acid with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee). The corresponding gram&#8208;scale reaction with a low catalyst loading and the derivatization of the &#946;&#8208;hydroxy carboxylic acids highlight the practicality of this transformation.

         <title>Direct Addition of Grignard Reagents to Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Enabled by Bulky turbo&#8208;Organomagnesium Anilides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 9, February 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adding the right amount: The addition of Grignard nucleophiles to carboxylic acids is made difficult by the lower nucleophilicity of these abundant organometallics, the low electrophilicity of carboxylate anions, and the faster over&#8208;addition to any ketones produced. Herein we introduce a simple magnesium anilide additive that enhances the nucleophilicity of Grignard reagents towards aliphatic carboxylates and stabilizes the product towards over&#8208;addition side reactions.







Abstract
The synthesis of ketones through addition of organometallic reagents to aliphatic carboxylic acids is a straightforward strategy that is limited to organolithium reagents. More desirable Grignard reagents can be activated and controlled with a bulky aniline&#8208;derived turbo&#8208;Hauser base. This operationally simple procedure allows the straightforward preparation of a variety of aliphatic and perfluoroalkyl ketones alike from functionalized alkyl, aryl and heteroaryl Grignard reagents.

         <title>Doubly&#8208;Reduced Pentacene in Different Coordination Environments: X&#8208;ray Crystallographic and Theoretical Insights into Structural and Electronic Changes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 9, February 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical reduction of pentacene with alkali metals ranging from Li to Cs readily affords the doubly&#8208;reduced anion that shows different binding preference for the lightest Li+ ion vs. heavier Group 1 congeners. DFT calculations provide full support for the X&#8208;ray crystallographic data by following changes in aromaticity and electronic structure of pentacene upon reduction.







Abstract
Chemical reduction of pentacene (C22H14, 1) with Group 1 metals ranging from Li to Cs revealed that 1 readily undergoes a two&#8208;fold reduction to afford a doubly&#8208;reduced 12&#8722; anion in THF. With the help of 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 ether used as a secondary coordinating agent, five &#960;&#8208;complexes of 12&#8722; with different alkali metal counterions have been isolated and fully characterized. This series of complexes enables the first evaluation of alkali&#8208;metal ion binding patterns and structural changes of the 12&#8722; dianion based on the crystallographically confirmed examples. The difference in coordination of the smallest Li+ ion vs. heavier Group 1 congeners has been demonstrated. In addition, the use of benzo&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 in the reaction of 1 with Na metal allowed the isolation of the unique solvent&#8208;separated ion product with a &#8220;naked&#8221; dianion, 12&#8722;. The detailed structural analyses of the series revealed the C&#8722;C bond alteration and core deformation of pentacene upon two&#8208;fold reduction and complexation. The negative charge localization at the central six&#8208;membered ring of 12&#8722; identified by theoretical calculations corroborates with the X&#8208;ray crystallographic results. Subsequent in&#8208;depth theoretical analysis provided a detailed description of changes in the electronic structure and aromaticity of pentacene upon reduction.

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Amino&#8208;iso&#8208;Butyric Acid Foldamers Terminated with Rhodium(I) N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysts</title>

Another twist: &#945;&#8208;Amino&#8208;iso&#8208;butyric acid foldamers terminated with rhodium(I) N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complexes have been shown to possess point, helical and axial chirality. Communication from chiral residues at the N&#8208;termini of these 1&#8197;nm long foldamers to rhodium(I) complexes at the C&#8208;termini led to unequal ratios of diastereoisomers, although this did not alter the stereoselectivity of hydrosilylation reactions catalyzed by these foldamers.







Abstract
To investigate how remotely induced changes in ligand folding might affect catalysis by organometallic complexes, dynamic &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;iso&#8208;butyric acid (Aib) peptide foldamers bearing rhodium(I) N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes have been synthesized and studied. X&#8208;ray crystallography of a foldamer with an N&#8208;terminal azide and a C&#8208;terminal Rh(NHC)(Cl)(diene) complex showed a racemate with a chiral axis in the Rh(NHC) complex and a distorted 310 helical body. Replacing the azide with either one or two chiral L&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methylvaline (L&#8208;&#945;MeVal) residues gave diastereoisomeric foldamers that each possessed point, helical and axial chirality. NMR spectroscopy revealed an unequal ratio of diastereoisomers for some foldamers, indicating that the chiral conformational preference of the N&#8208;terminal residue(s) was relayed down the 1&#8197;nm helical body to the axially chiral Rh(NHC) complex. Although the remote chiral residue(s) did not affect the stereoselectivity of hydrosilylation reactions catalysed by these foldamers, these studies suggest a potential pathway towards remote conformational control of organometallic catalysts.

         <title>Characterization of Cyclic N&#8208;Acyliminium Ions by Infrared Ion Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 9, February 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Acyliminium ions (NAIs) are highly reactive intermediates that are important for the construction of CC&#8208;bonds adjacent to nitrogen atoms. These species have been characterized for the first time in the gas phase by collision induced dissociation tandem mass spectrometry followed by infrared ion spectroscopy (IRIS), which has led to new structural information that can be invoked to explain the diastereoselectivity of reactions involving these cationic intermediates.







Abstract
N&#8208;Acyliminium ions are highly reactive intermediates that are important for creating CC&#8208;bonds adjacent to nitrogen atoms. Here we report the characterization of cyclic N&#8208;acyliminium ions in the gas phase, generated by collision induced dissociation tandem mass spectrometry followed by infrared ion spectroscopy using the FELIX infrared free electron laser. Comparison of DFT calculated spectra with the experimentally observed IR spectra provided valuable insights in the conformations of the N&#8208;acyliminium ions.

         <title>Piers&#8242; Borane&#8208;Induced Tetramerization of Arylacetylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 9, February 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocyclization: The formation of tetra&#8208;aryl&#8208;tetrahydropentalenes upon the reaction of arylacetylenes with Piers&#8217; borane (HB(C6F5)2) is reported. Isotope labeling experiments and DFT computations indicate that the mechanism of this complex transformation commences with a series of unprecedented 1,2&#8208;carboborations, followed by an electrocyclization and two skeletal rearrangements.







Abstract
We herein report that the reaction of Piers&#8242; borane, i.&#8201;e. HB(C6F5)2, with an excess of arylacetylenes at room temperature leads to tetramerization of the acetylene and the diastereoselective formation of boryl&#8208;substituted tetra&#8208;aryl&#8208;tetrahydropentalenes. The reaction mechanism was investigated by isotope labeling experiments and DFT computations. These investigations indicate that a series of 1,2&#8208;carboboration reactions form an octatetraene that undergoes an electrocyclization. Two skeletal rearrangements then presumably lead to the formation of the tetrahydropentalene core. Overall, this intricate and unprecedented transformation comprises five carbon&#8208;carbon bond formations in a single reaction.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Domino Hydroformylation/Hydrogenation of Olefins to Alcohols: Synergy of Two Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 9, February 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Going to plan: Olefins have been hydroxymethylated by using an iridium catalyst and the synergy of two ligands. DFT calculations provided a chance to develop new catalytic systems before empirical studies were undertaken. Then the iridium&#8208;catalyzed domino hydroformylation/reduction of olefins to alcohols under water&#8211;gas shift reaction conditions was studied as an example. Two different ligands (L1 and L10) applied at the same time improved alcohol yields and verified the computational model.







Abstract
A novel one&#8208;pot iridium&#8208;catalyzed domino hydroxymethylation of olefins, which relies on using two different ligands at the same time, is reported. DFT computation reveals different activities for the individual hydroformylation and hydrogenation steps in the presence of mono&#8208; and bidentate ligands. Whereas bidentate ligands have higher hydrogenation activity, monodentate ligands show higher hydroformylation activity. Accordingly, a catalyst system is introduced that uses dual ligands in the whole domino process. Control experiments show that the overall selectivity is kinetically controlled. Both computation and experiment explain the function of the two optimized ligands during the domino process.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bridged Oligosilanylsilyl Mono&#8208; and Oligosilanylsilyl Dications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 9, February 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The presence of multiple Si&#8722;H functionalities in one molecule is used to generate at low temperatures oligosilane&#8208;based mono&#8208; and dications that are stabilized by intramolecular 3c2e Si&#8722;H&#8722;Si bridges. For the oligosilanylsilyl monocation, a rapid intramolecular Si&#8722;H group exchange is monitored by NMR spectroscopy at low temperatures. This dynamic process is not observed for the corresponding dication. According to the obtained NMR data, both cationic Si&#8722;H&#8722;Si bridges are electronically isolated by the trisilanyl backbone.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bridged oligosilanylsilyl borates 8&#8201;[B(C6F5)4], 9[B(C6F5)4] and diborates 10&#8201;[B(C6F5)4]2 have been prepared by hydride transfer between &#945;&#8208;&#969;&#8208;dihydrido&#8208; (11) and branched tetrahydrido&#8208;oligosilanes (13) and trityl cation. The obtained cyclic intramolecularly stabilized silylium ions 8, 9 and bissilylium ion 10 were characterized by low temperature NMR spectroscopy supported by the results of density functional calculations. The branched Si&#8722;H&#8722;Si monocation 9 undergoes at low temperatures a fast degenerate rearrangement, which exchanges the Si&#8722;H groups with a barrier of 31&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 via an antarafacial transition state. Reaction of the branched monocation 9 with a second equivalent of trityl cation or of the branched oligosilane 13 with two equivalents of trityl cation, gives at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C the corresponding bissilylium ion 10, an example for a new class of highly reactive poly&#8208;Lewis acids.

&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen-bridged oligosilanylsilyl borates &lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;[B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;], &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;[B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] and diborates &lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;[B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; have been prepared by hydride transfer between &#945;-&#969;-dihydrido- (&lt;b&gt;11&lt;/b&gt;) and branched tetrahydrido-oligosilanes (&lt;b&gt;13&lt;/b&gt;) and trityl cation. The obtained cyclic intramolecularly stabilized silylium ions &lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;silylium ion &lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt; were characterized by low temperature NMR spectroscopy supported by the results of density functional calculations. The branched Si&#8722;H&#8722;Si monocation &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt; undergoes at low temperatures a fast degenerate rearrangement, which exchanges the Si&#8722;H groups with a barrier of 31&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; via an &lt;i&gt;antarafacial&lt;/i&gt; transition state. Reaction of the branched monocation &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt; with a second equivalent of trityl cation or of the branched oligosilane &lt;b&gt;13&lt;/b&gt; with two equivalents of trityl cation, gives at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C the corresponding &lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;silylium ion &lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt;, an example for a new class of highly reactive poly-Lewis acids.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photochemical Sandmeyer&#8208;type Halogenation of Arenediazonium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 9, February 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
One hundred and forty years after its discovery, key limitations of the Sandmeyer reaction were overcome. The use of trihalide salts as mediators enable the photochemical conversion of diazonium salts into the corresponding aryl halides without an environmentally problematic transition&#8208;metal mediator. A wide variety of aryl bromides, chlorides and iodides were formed in excellent selectivities for halogenation over hydridodediazotization, obviating the laborious separation of halogenated products from non&#8208;halogenated analogues.@ruhrunibochum







Abstract
Trihalide salts were found to efficiently promote photochemical dediazotizing halogenations of diazonium salts. In contrast to classical Sandmeyer reactions, no metal catalysts are required to achieve high yields and outstanding selectivities for halogenation over competing hydridodediazotization. Convenient protocols are disclosed for synthetically meaningful brominations, iodinations, and chlorinations of diversely functionalized derivatives.

         <title>Add a Pinch of Tetrel: The Transformation of a Centrosymmetric Metal into a Nonsymmorphic and Chiral Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 9, February 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The substitution of a small amount of silicon to the known composition of RhP3 (centrosymmetric space group Im
) yields novel RhSi0.3P2.7 (space group P212121) which has a noncentrosymmetric, nonsymmorphic, and chiral crystal structure. We hypothesize that a combination of M&#8722;Tt and M&#8722;Pn bonding favors noncentrosymmetric structures. Therefore, by adding a &#8220;pinch&#8221; of tetrel to known centrosymmetric metal pnictide compositions, new noncentrosymmetric structures may be realized.







Abstract
Centrosymmetric skutterudite RhP3 was converted to a nonsymmorphic and chiral compound RhSi0.3P2.7 (space group P212121) by means of partial replacement of Si for P. The structure, determined by a combination of X&#8208;ray crystallography and solid state 31P&#8197;NMR, exhibits branched polyanionic P/Si chains that are unique among metal phosphides. A driving force to stabilize the locally noncentrosymmetric cis&#8208;RhSi2P4 and fac&#8208;RhSi3P3 fragments is &#960;&#8208;electron back&#8208;donation between the Rh t2g&#8208;type orbitals and the unoccupied antibonding Si/P orbitals, which is more effective for Si than for P. In situ studies and total energy calculations revealed the metastable nature of RhSi0.3P2.7. Electronic structure calculations predicted centrosymmetric cubic RhP3 to be metallic which was confirmed by transport properties measurements. In contrast, the electronic structure for chiral orthorhombic RhSi0.3P2.7 contained a bandgap, and this compound was shown to be a narrow gap semiconductor.

         <title>The Impact of Research Culture on Mental Health &amp; Diversity in STEM</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 9, February 16, 2022. </description>

This paper focuses on key aspects of academic research culture that can impact STEM researcher mental health: bullying and harassment; precarity of contracts; diversity, inclusion, and accessibility; and the competitive research landscape, as well as exploring why mental health matters for researchers. Further, key recommendations are provided and actionable steps are outlined that institutions can take to make research in STEM inclusive for all.







Abstract
The onset of COVID&#8208;19, coupled with the finer lens placed on systemic racial disparities within our society, has resulted in increased discussions around mental health. Despite this, mental health struggles in research are still often viewed as individual weaknesses and not the result of a larger dysfunctional research culture. Mental health interventions in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) academic community often focus on what individuals can do to improve their mental health instead of focusing on improving the research environment. In this paper, we present four aspects of research that may heavily impact mental health based on our experiences as research scientists: bullying and harassment; precarity of contracts; diversity, inclusion, and accessibility; and the competitive research landscape. Based on these aspects, we propose systemic changes that institutions must adopt to ensure their research culture is supportive and allows everyone to thrive.

         <title>Front Cover: Direct Addition of Grignard Reagents to Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Enabled by Bulky turbo&#8208;Organomagnesium Anilides (Chem. Eur. J. 9/2022)</title>

Grignard reagents (R&#8208;Mg&#8208;X) are commercial carbon nucleophiles commonly used in organic synthesis, but their stability becomes a limitation for the least&#8208;reactive electrophiles. A bulky magnesium anilide additive (in purple) generates a new organometallic reagent (R&#8722;Mg&#8208;NHAr) in&#8197;situ that boosts the nucleophilicity and selectivity of the organometallic ligand (in green). In the Research Article by A. Mendoza and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104053), these reagents prove to be instrumental in the direct synthesis of ketones from carboxylic acids, a transformation that was only possible with some organolithium reagents before.

         <title>Cover Feature: Revisiting the Fundamental Nature of Metal&#8208;Ligand Bonding: An Impartial and Automated Fitting Procedure for Angular Overlap Model Parameters (Chem. Eur. J. 9/2022)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 9, February 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our work on ligand field theory&#8212;an automated fitting procedure for Angular Overlap Model (AOM) parameters&#8212;is reflected by Van Gogh's Field with Irises near Arles. We showcase the capabilities of this procedure with a two&#8208;dimensional spectrochemical series with the metals manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel and copper and the halides fluoride, chloride, bromide and iodide. The perspective in van Gogh's field resembles a correlation we found between the halide ligands&#8217; AOM parameters and their chemical hardness. More information can be found in the Research Article by V. Krewald et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103775). Original image credit: Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam (Vincent van Gogh Foundation).

Structural and electrochemical data for [Cp*Rh] complexes spanning three oxidation states demonstrate that the 9,9&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;diazafluorene ligand, a notable but uncommon analogue of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine, can stabilize electron&#8208;rich species through &#960;&#8208;backbonding and concomitant charge delocalization.

         <title>Bioinspired Artificial Photosynthetic Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 9, February 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different approaches to emulate functions of the native photosynthetic apparatus by artificial systems are introduced. One approach involves the integration of native photosynthetic systems with artificial materials onto electrode surfaces to yield photobioelectrochemical cells. A second approach involves the assembly of supramolecular photosensitizer/electron acceptor assemblies leading to the efficient light&#8208;induced formational of election&#8208;transfer redox products. A third approach addresses the design of dynamic networks stimulating controlled electron&#8208;transfer processes leading to the formation of fuel products under thermodynamically&#8208;guided or out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium conditions.







Abstract
Mimicking photosynthesis using artificial systems, as a means for solar energy conversion and green fuel generation, is one of the holy grails of modern science. This perspective presents recent advances towards developing artificial photosynthetic systems. In one approach, native photosystems are interfaced with electrodes to yield photobioelectrochemical cells that transform light energy into electrical power. This is exemplified by interfacing photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII) as an electrically contacted assembly mimicking the native Z&#8208;scheme, and by the assembly of an electrically wired PSI/glucose oxidase biocatalytic conjugate on an electrode support. Illumination of the functionalized electrodes led to light&#8208;induced generation of electrical power, or to the generation of photocurrents using glucose as the fuel. The second approach introduces supramolecular photosensitizer nucleic acid/electron acceptor complexes as functional modules for effective photoinduced electron transfer stimulating the subsequent biocatalyzed generation of NADPH or the Pt&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;catalyzed evolution of molecular hydrogen. Application of the DNA machineries for scaling&#8208;up the photosystems is demonstrated. A third approach presents the integration of artificial photosynthetic modules into dynamic nucleic acid networks undergoing reversible reconfiguration or dissipative transient operation in the presence of auxiliary triggers. Control over photoinduced electron transfer reactions and photosynthetic transformations by means of the dynamic networks is demonstrated.

         <title>Mild Microfluidic Approaches to Oxide Nanoparticles Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 9, February 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review reports the preparation of oxide nanoparticles in microreactors under continuous flow conditions. The use of suitable methodologies allows to manage the size and shape of the nanoparticles, through the fast mixing of the reagents and the precise control of the reaction conditions that can be achieved within flow devices, if compared to batch syntheses.







Abstract
Oxide nanoparticles (oxide NPs) are advanced materials with a wide variety of applications in different fields. The use of continuous flow methods is particularly appealing for their synthesis due to the high control achieved over the reaction conditions and the easy process scalability. The present review focuses on the preparation of oxide NPs using microfluidic setups at low temperature (&#8804;80&#8201;&#176;C), since the employment of mild reaction conditions is crucial for developing sustainable and cost&#8208;effective processes. A particular emphasis will be put on the improvement over the final product features (e.&#8201;g., size, shape, and size distribution) given by flow methods with respect to conventional batch procedures. The main issues that arise by treating NPs suspensions in microfluidic systems are product deposition or channel clogging; mitigation strategies to overcome these drawbacks will also be presented and discussed.

         <title>In vitro anticancer ability of nano fluorescent 111In&#8208;MIL&#8208;68/PEG&#8208;FA on Hela cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In past decades, nanoscale metal&#8208;organic frameworks (NMOFs) have drawn more and more attention in multimodal imaging and targeting therapy of various malignant cancers. Here, we proposed to dope 111In into fluorescent In&#8208;based NMOFs (In&#8208;MIL&#8208;68&#8208;NH2), with an attempt to prepare a new nanomedicine with great anti&#8208;cancer potential. As a proof of concept, the obtained NMOF (In&#8208;MIL&#8208;68/PEG&#8208;FA) with targeting motifs is able to act as a fluorescent probe to achieve Hela cell imaging. Moreover, the Auger electron emitter 111In built in corresponding radioactive NMOF (111In&#8208;MIL&#8208;68/PEG&#8208;FA) can bring clear damage to cancer cells, resulting in a high cell killing rate of 59.3% within 48 h. In addition, the cell cycle presented a significant dose&#8208;dependent G2/M inhibiting mode, which indicates that 111In&#8208;MIL&#8208;68/PEG&#8208;FA&#160;has the ability to facilitate the cancer cells to enter apoptotic program. This work demonstrated the potential of 111In labelled NMOFs in specific killings of cancer cells, providing a new approach to develop nanomedicines with theranostic function.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;fluorinated [7]helicenes are photolabile and undergo a double fluorine atom transfer.&#160;Herein, we show that the transferred product further undergoes a skeletal transformation on silica gel.&#160;The transformation begins with activation of the allylic C&#8211;F bond on the silanol surface.&#160;Then, the resulting carbocation readily undergoes a regioselective nucleophilic aromatic substitution with water, depending on the position of the fluorine substituents.&#160;Hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol also activated the allylic C&#8211;F bond and acted as a nucleophile.&#160;These findings support the generation of a highly reactive cationic electrophilic intermediate in the successive transformations involving fluorine atoms.</dc:description>

For example, complexes  1  and  2  on reaction with  L  1  and  L  2  afforded dihydridoborate species [LAM(&#956;&#8208;H)  2  BHL]  4&#8208;6  (  4  : L  A  = Cp*, M = Ru, L = amt;  5  : L  A  = Cp*, M = Ru, L = mp;  6  : L  A  = COD, M = Ir, L = mp). On the other hand, treatment of  3  with  L  2  yielded  cis  &#8208; and  trans  &#8208;bis(dihydridoborate) species, [Ru{(  &#956;  &#8208;H)  2  BH(mp)}  2  ],  cis  &#8208;  7  and  trans  &#8208;  7  .

Fascinatingly, despite having reduced natural charges on Ru centres both at  cis  &#8208; and  trans  &#8208;  7  , they underwent hydroboration reaction with alkynes that yielded both Markovnikov and anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition products,  10a&#8208;d  .</dc:description>

         <title>Solid Base Assisted Dual&#8208;Promoted Heterogeneous Conversion of PVC to Metal&#8208;Free Porous Carbon Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is widely used in daily life, but its waste has become a serious environmental problem. A solid base assisted low&#8208;temperature solvothermal dehalogenation was developed in this work to sustainably and efficiently transform PVC into high&#8208;value dimethylamine hydrochloride (DMACl) chemical and N,O co&#8208;doped carbon monolith with hierarchically porous structure. The synergistic promotion of solid&#8208;base catalyst and solvent decomposition with the removal of HCl can shift forward the chemical equilibrium to promote the dechlorination of PVC and increase the carbon yield. Meanwhile, the solid&#8208;base catalyst can also act as a pore&#8208;forming additive to fabricate the carbon monolith with hierarchical pores. Induced by the high specific surface area, hierarchical pores and N,O co&#8208;doped structure, the generated carbon monolith exhibits superior electrocatalytic performance towards H  2  evolution. These discoveries shed light on the design of synergistically coupled solvent and solid catalyst to promote the heterogeneous conversion of waste chlorinated plastics into high&#8208;value chemicals for a sustainable future.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Strong Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Absorbing Cyclometalated Iridium(III) Complexes for Robust and Efficient Light &#8208; Driven Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Weak light absorption has hidden the use of most Ir(III) complexes as efficient photosensitizers in photocatalytic hydrogen generation from water. To address this issue, a series of cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes (  Ir1  &#8208;  Ir5  ), featuring different electron&#8208;donating substituents to enhance the absorptivity, have been synthesized and studied as photosensitizers (PSs) for light&#8208;driven hydrogen production from water.  Ir6  &#8211;  Ir7  were prepared as fundamental systems for comparisons. Electron donors, including 9&#8208;phenylcarbazole, triphenylamine, 4,4'&#8208;dimethoxytriphenylamine, 4,4'&#8208;di(  N  &#8208;hexylcarbazole)triphenylamine moieties were introduced on 6&#8208;(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenanthridine&#8208;based cyclometalating (C^N) ligands to explore the donor effect on the hydrogen evolution performance of these cationic Ir(III) complexes. Remarkably,  Ir  4  with 4,4'&#8208;dimethoxytriphenylamine achieved the highest turn&#8208;over number (TON) of 12,300 and initial turnover frequency (TOF  i  ) of 394 h  &#8722;  1  , with initial activity (activity  i  ) of 547,000 &#956;mol g  &#8722;1  h  &#8722;1  and initial apparent quantum yield (AQY  i  ) of 9.59%, under the illumination of blue light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) for 105 hours, which demonstrated a stable three&#8208;component photocatalytic system with high efficiency. The TON (based on  n  (H  2  )/  n  (PSr)) in this study is the highest value reported to date among the similar photocatalytic systems using Ir(III) complexes with Pt nanoparticles as catalyst. Great potential of using triphenylamine&#8208;based Ir(III) PSs in boosting the photocatalytic performance has also been shown.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Weak light absorption has hidden the use of most Ir(III) complexes as efficient photosensitizers in photocatalytic hydrogen generation from water. To address this issue, a series of cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes (  Ir1  -  Ir5  ), featuring different electron-donating substituents to enhance the absorptivity, have been synthesized and studied as photosensitizers (PSs) for light-driven hydrogen production from water.  Ir6  &#8211;  Ir7  were prepared as fundamental systems for comparisons. Electron donors, including 9-phenylcarbazole, triphenylamine, 4,4'-dimethoxytriphenylamine, 4,4'-di(  N  -hexylcarbazole)triphenylamine moieties were introduced on 6-(thiophen-2-yl)phenanthridine-based cyclometalating (C^N) ligands to explore the donor effect on the hydrogen evolution performance of these cationic Ir(III) complexes. Remarkably,  Ir  4  with 4,4'-dimethoxytriphenylamine achieved the highest turn-over number (TON) of 12,300 and initial turnover frequency (TOF  i  ) of 394 h  &#8722;  1  , with initial activity (activity  i  ) of 547,000 &#956;mol g  &#8722;1  h  &#8722;1  and initial apparent quantum yield (AQY  i  ) of 9.59%, under the illumination of blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs) for 105 hours, which demonstrated a stable three-component photocatalytic system with high efficiency.

         <title>Sigma/pi bonding preferences of solvated alkali&#8208;metal cations to ditopic arylmethyl anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Arylmethyl anions allow alkali&#8208;metals to bind in a &#963;&#8208;fashion to the lateral carbanionic centre or a &#960;&#8208;fashion to the aryl ring or in between these extremities, with the trend towards &#960; bonding increasing on descending group 1. Here we review known alkali&#8208;metal structures of diphenylmethane, fluorene, 2&#8208;benzylpyridine and 4&#8208;benzylpyridine. Next, we synthesise Li, Na, K monomers of these diarylmethyls using polydentate donors PMDETA or Me  6  TREN to remove competing oligomerizing interactions, studying the effect that two aromatic rings have on negative charge (de)localisation via NMR, X&#8208;ray crystallographic and DFT studies. Diphenylmethyl and fluorenyl anions maintain C(H)&#8208;M interactions regardless of alkali&#8208;metal, although the adjacent arene carbons engage in interactions with larger alkali&#8208;metals. Introducing a nitrogen atom into the ring (at the 2&#8208; or 4&#8208;position) encourages relocalisation of negative charge away from the deprotonated carbon and onto nitrogen. Phenyl(2&#8208;pyridyl)methyl moves from an enamide formation at one extremity (lithium) to an aza&#8208;allyl formation at the other extremity (potassium), while C&#8208; or N&#8208; coordination modes become energetically viable for Na and K phenyl(4&#8208;pyridyl)methyl complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Oligomerization of Aromatic Amino Acids Induced by Gaps in Four&#8208;Helix Bundles of DNA or RNA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Folded nucleic acids with no more than 65 base pairs were found to act as amino acid polymerase for aromatic amino acids. Both DNA and RNA 4&#8208;helix bundles showed this effect, which was most pronounced for tryptophan.







Abstract
The formation of peptides from amino acids is one of the processes associated with life. Because of the dominant role of translation in extant biology, peptide&#8208;forming processes that are RNA induced are of particular interest. We have previously reported the formation of phosphoramidate&#8208;linked peptido RNAs as the products of spontaneous condensation reactions between ribonucleotides and free amino acids in aqueous solution. We now asked whether four&#8208;helix bundle (4HB) DNA or RNA folding motifs with a single&#8208; or double&#8208;nucleotide gap next to a 5&#8217;&#8208;phosphate can act as reaction sites for phosphoramidate formation. For glycine, this was found to be the case, whereas phenylalanine and tryptophan showed accelerated formation of peptides without a covalent link to the nucleic acid. Free peptides with up to 11 tryptophan or phenylalanine residues were found in precipitates forming in the presence of gap&#8208;containing DNA or RNA 4HBs. Control experiments using motifs with just a nick or primer alone did not have the same effect. Because folded structures with a gap in a double helix are likely products of hybridization of strands formed in statistically controlled oligomerization reactions, our results are interesting in the context of prebiotic scenarios. Independent of a putative role in evolution, our findings suggest that for some aromatic amino acids an RNA&#8208;induced pathway for oligomerization exists that does not have a discernable link to translation.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is still challenging to realize the dual&#8208;emission system, in which two luminescent bands simultaneously appear by the photo excitation, in solid with organic dyes due to difficulty in regulation of electronic properties in the excited state and concentration quenching.  o  &#8208;Carborane is known to be a versatile platform for constructing solid&#8208;state emitters since the sphere boron cluster is favorable for suppressing intermolecular interactions and subsequently concentration quenching. In this paper, we show the solid&#8208;state dual&#8208;emissive  o  &#8208;carborane derivatives. We prepared 4 types of  o  &#8208;carborane derivatives and found dual&#8208;emission behaviors both in solution and solid states. By regulating rotation at the  o  &#8208;carborane unit with the intramolecular C  cage  H&#183;&#183;&#183;O interaction, intensity ratios in dual emission were changed. Finally, it was demonstrated that the overall photoluminescence spectra can be estimated by the binding energy of intramolecular interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast and Cysteine&#8208;Specific Modification of Peptides, Proteins and Bacteriophage Using Chlorooximes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report a novel chlorooxime mediated modification of native peptides and proteins under physiologic conditions. This method features fast reaction kinetics (apparent k 2 = 306 &#177; 4 M &#8208;1 s &#8208;1 for GSH) and exquisite selectivity for cysteine residues. This cysteine conjugation reaction can be carried out with just single&#8208;digit micromolar concentrations of the labeling reagent. The conjugates show high stability towards acid, base, and external thiol nucleophiles. A nitrile oxide species generated in situ is likely involved as the key intermediate. Furthermore, a bis&#8208;chlorooxime reagent is synthesized to enable facile Cys&#8208;Cys stapling in native peptides and proteins. This highly efficient cysteine conjugation and stapling was further implemented on bacteriophage to construct chemically modified phage libraries.</dc:description>

         <title>Hollow Capsule NiCo2NS Prepared by Self&#8208;Sacrificing Template Method for High&#8208;Efficiency Bifunctional Catalyst and its Application in Zn&#8208;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring the application of high&#8208;efficiency bifunctional oxygen catalysts to rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries has been a research hotspot in recent years. We succeeded in obtaining NiCo  2  NS with a hollow capsule structure through the self&#8208;sacrificing template method, which has a larger specific surface area and can provide more active sites. The introduction of S can change the valence distribution of N and the electronic structure of the M&#8208;N bond, so that NiCo  2  NS exhibits excellent performance in the overpotential and stability of ORR and OER. It shows overpotential of 154 mV at 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  and a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.76 V. When used as a dual&#8208;function catalyst in ZABs, it exhibits good stability within 400 h. The flexible battery assembled by NiCo  2  NS also shows excellent performance, and can be cycled stably for 20 hours. The current maintains good stability when it is bent at different angles during the cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective C&#8722;H Functionalization Reactions under Gold Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The gold&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H functionalization reactions has gained significant attention as it often provides complementary chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities as compared to other transition metal&#8208;catalyzed processes. This review focuses on the recent developments in the field of enantioselective C&#8722;H functionalization reactions under gold catalysis and also highlights the mechanistic rationale at the appropriate places.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective functionalization of ubiquitous C&#8722;H bonds has proven to be promising field as it offers the construction of chiral molecular complexity in a step&#8208; and atom&#8208;economical manner. In recent years, gold has emerged as an attractive contender for catalyzing such reactions. The unique reactivities and selectivities offered by gold catalysts have been exploited to access numerous asymmetric transformations based on gold&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization processes. Herein, this review critically highlights the major advances and discoveries made in the enantioselective C&#8722;H functionalization under gold catalysis which is accompanied by mechanistic insights at appropriate places.

         <title>Development of Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Lewis Acid&#8208;Initiated Double Arylation of Aldehyde: A Facile Approach Towards the Total Synthesis of Anti&#8208;Breast&#8208;Cancer Agent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free approach for the synthesis of symmetrical/unsymmetrical triarylmethanes and diarylmethanes is reported. This protocol features mild conditions, feedstock reagents, very low catalyst loading, remarkable scope (&gt;85 examples) and gram&#8208;scale synthesis (TON=475). Moreover, several unexplored biologically active molecules for example, the antiparkinson agent, vibrindole A, turbomycin B and, total synthesis of an anti&#8208;breast&#8208;cancer agent is demonstrated. Control experiments and mechanistic studies have also been carried out to detect the reaction intermediates and reaction progress to elucidate the possible reaction mechanism.







Abstract
This work describes a mild and robust double hydroarylation strategy for the synthesis of symmetrical /unsymmetrical diaryl&#8208; and triarylmethanes in excellent yields using Lambert salt (0.2&#8211;1.0&#8197;mol%). Despite the anticipated challenges associated with controlling selective product formation, unsymmetrical diaryl&#8208; and triarylmethanes products are obtained unprecedentedly. A highly efficient gram scale reaction has also been reported (TON for symmetrical product=475 and for unsymmetrical product=390). The synthetic utility of the methodology is demonstrated by the preparation of several unexplored diaryl&#8208; and triarylmethane&#8208;based biologically relevant molecules, such as arundine, vibrindole A, turbomycin B, and certain anti&#8208;inflammatory agents. A total synthesis of an anti&#8208;breast&#8208;cancer agent is also demonstrated. Control experiments, Hammett analysis, HRMS and GC&#8208;MS studies reveal the reaction intermediates and reaction mechanism.

         <title>Role of Anionic Backbone in NHC&#8208;Stabilized Coinage Metal Complexes: New Precursors for Atomic Layer Deposition**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In pursuit of new precursors for the deposition of coinage metals by atomic layer deposition (ALD), a series of new N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;based CuI and AgI complexes has been synthesized, analyzed, and evaluated for their potential use in ALD. One precursor was found to be particularly useful for the deposition of metallic copper when using hydroquinone as the reducing agent in a thermally driven ALD process.







Abstract
Cu and Ag precursors that are volatile, reactive, and thermally stable are currently of high interest for their application in atomic&#8208;layer deposition (ALD) of thin metal films. In pursuit of new precursors for coinage metals, namely Cu and Ag, a series of new N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;based CuI and AgI complexes were synthesized. Modifications in the substitution pattern of diketonate&#8208;based anionic backbones led to five monomeric Cu complexes and four closely related Ag complexes with the general formula [M(tBuNHC)(R)] (M=Cu, Ag; tBuNHC=1,3&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene; R=diketonate). Thermal analysis indicated that most of the Cu complexes are thermally stable and volatile compared to the more fragile Ag analogs. One of the promising Cu precursors was evaluated for the ALD of nanoparticulate Cu metal deposits by using hydroquinone as the reducing agent at appreciably low deposition temperatures (145&#8211;160&#8201;&#176;C). This study highlights the considerable impact of the employed ligand sphere on the structural and thermal properties of metal complexes that are relevant for vapor&#8208;phase processing of thin films.

         <title>In&#8208;situ Synthesis of the Thinnest In2Se3/In2S3/In2Se3 Sandwich&#8208;Like Heterojunction for Photoelectrocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sandwich&#8208;like In2Se3/In2S3/In2Se3 (SW In2S3@In2Se3) heterojunction was fabricated via the in&#8197;situ synthesis method for water splitting. The in&#8197;situ synthesis technology was used to realize the overall transformation of the exterior of ultra&#8208;thin two&#8208;dimensional nanosheets while ensuring that the nanosheet array is not damaged in this work. The sandwich&#8208;like structure constructed by this technology avoids the problems of heterojunction stacking. As a result, the SW In2S3@In2Se3 shows the best photoelectrochemical water splitting performance and excellent stability.







Abstract
The efficient utilization of solar energy for photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) water splitting is a feasible solution for developing clean energy and alleviating environmental issues. However, as the core of PEC technology, the existing photoanode catalysts have disadvantages such as poor photoelectrocatalytic conversion efficiency, low conductivity of photogenerated carriers, and instability. Here, we report the ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional sandwich&#8208;like (SW) heterojunction of In2Se3/In2S3/In2Se3 (SW In2S3@In2Se3) for the first time for PEC water splitting. Our findings identify the efficient separation of electrons and holes by constructing SW In2S3@In2Se3 heterojunction. The in&#8197;situ synthesis of ultrathin nanosheet arrays by using surface substitution of Se atom to epitaxially grow cell In2Se3 maximizes the contact area of heterogeneous interface and accelerates the transmission of charge carrier. Benefitting from the unique structure and composition characteristic, SW In2S3@In2Se3 displays excellent performance in PEC water splitting. The photocurrent density of SW In2S3@In2Se3 reaches 8.43&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;VRHE. Compared with In2S3, the SW In2S3@In2Se3 photoanode has nearly 12 times higher PEC performance, which represents the best performance among the In2S3&#8208;based photoanode heterojunction reported so far. The evolution rate of O2 reaches 78.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1, and the photocurrent has no apparent variety within 24&#8197;h.

The in&#8197;situ synthesis technology was used to realize the overall transformation of the exterior of ultra-thin two-dimensional nanosheets while ensuring that the nanosheet array is not damaged in this work. The sandwich-like structure constructed by this technology avoids the problems of heterojunction stacking. As a result, the SW In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;@In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; shows the best photoelectrochemical water splitting performance and excellent stability.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The efficient utilization of solar energy for photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) water splitting is a feasible solution for developing clean energy and alleviating environmental issues. However, as the core of PEC technology, the existing photoanode catalysts have disadvantages such as poor photoelectrocatalytic conversion efficiency, low conductivity of photogenerated carriers, and instability. Here, we report the ultrathin two-dimensional sandwich-like (SW) heterojunction of In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (SW In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;@In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) for the first time for PEC water splitting. Our findings identify the efficient separation of electrons and holes by constructing SW In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;@In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; heterojunction.

         <title>Tunable Excimer Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Isohexide Derivatives from Renewable Resources</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and economical protocol for obtaining new CPL&#8208;emitting materials starting from natural chiral scaffold was developed. By choosing the scaffold, the aromatic moiety and the spacer, fine tuning of CPL and especially inversion of the preferential circular polarization of the emitted light was obtained.







Abstract
Organic compounds showing circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) are at the forefront of novel applications and technologies. Here we show the synthesis and chiroptical properties of pyrene and perylene derivatives of inexpensive chiral scaffolds: isomannide and isosorbide. Low&#8208;intensity ECD spectra were obtained, suggesting the absence of chromophore interaction in the ground state, except in the case of isomannide bis&#8208;perylenecarboxylate, whose ECD spectrum showed a positive exciton couplet. All isomannide derivatives, with the only exception of the one containing a pyrenecarboxylate and a perylenecarboxylate, exhibited excimer CPL spectra, whereas isosorbide derivatives did not show any CPL. Isomannide derivatives bearing two pyrenecarboxylate or two pyrenylacetate groups showed positive CPL emission with dissymmetry factors up to 10&#8722;2, which depends on the conformational freedom of the appended units. The CPL sign, Stokes shift and order of magnitude of dissymmetry factor were reproduced by excited&#8208;state calculations on a representative compound. Interestingly, the mixed derivative containing pyrenic units with different spacing from the isomannide scaffold showed an oppositely signed excimer band with respect to the homo&#8208;substituted derivatives.

         <dc:description>We report two tripodal  C  3  &#8208;symmetric photoswitchable molecular systems  T1  and  T2  with extended conjugation at external and internal positions using acryl group. The influence of the extended &#960;&#8208;bonds in their absorption properties, thermal relaxation of the photoisomers and their propensities in forming supramolecular self&#8208;assemblies have been explored through spectroscopy, and microscopic studies. In particular, the investigations on the self&#8208;assembly have been carried out using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), polarized optical microscopy (POM), X&#8208;ray diffraction studies (XRD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Remarkably, the position of the acryl group influences the behaviour of the two target molecules in supramolecular assembly, and also in the formation of photoresponsive organic hydrogels or microcrystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid and high&#8208;throughput SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA detection without RNA extraction and amplification using a microfluidic biochip</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ongoing outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome&#8208;coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) has spread globally and poses a threat to public health and national economic development. Rapid and high&#8208;throughput SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA detection without the need of RNA extraction and amplification remain a key challenge. In this study, we developed a novel SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA detection strategy using a microfluidic biochip for the rapid and ultrasensitive detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 without RNA extraction and amplification. The developed strategy takes advantage of the specific SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA and probe DNA reaction in the microfluidic channel, fluorescence signal regulation by nanomaterials, and accurate sample control by the microfluidic chip. It presents an ultralow limit of detection of 600 copies/mL in a large linear detection regime from 1 aM to 100 fM. Fifteen samples were simultaneously detected in 40 min without the need for RNA purification and amplification. The detection accuracy of the strategy was validated via quantitative reverse transcription&#8208;polymerase chain reaction (qRT&#8208;PCR), with a recovery of 99&#8208;113%. Therefore, the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA detection strategy proposed in this study can potentially be used for the quantitative diagnosis of viral infectious diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>The Potential of Micellar Media in the Synthesis of DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA&#8208;encoded libraries (DELs) have become a widely used technology in drug discovery. The use of micelle&#8208;forming surfactants provides new possibilities for synthetic organic chemistry and could be a promising technique for DNA&#8208;compatible chemistry as well. This review provides a summary of existing examples of micellar DEL approaches, together with a selection of micellar organic transformations fundamentally suitable for DEL synthesis.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;encoded library (DEL) technology has become widely used in drug discovery research. The construction of DELs requires robust organic transformations that proceed in aqueous media under mild conditions. Unfortunately, the application of water as reaction medium for organic synthesis is not evident due to the generally limited solubility of organic reagents. However, the use of surfactants can offer a solution to this issue. Oil&#8208;in&#8208;water microemulsions formed by surfactant micelles are able to localize hydrophobic reagents inside them, resulting in high local concentrations of the organic substances in an otherwise poorly solvated environment. This review provides a conceptual and critical summary of micellar synthesis possibilities that are well suited to DEL synthesis. Existing examples of micellar DEL approaches, together with a selection of micellar organic transformations fundamentally suitable for DEL are discussed.

         <title>Electronic Circular Dichroism&#8208;Circularly Polarized Raman (eCP&#8208;Raman): A New Form of Chiral Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A newly developed chiral Raman spectroscopy, eCP&#8208;Raman, which combines high chirality sensitivity of electronic CD and high resolution capability of Raman is reported in this Concept article. The model for quantifying eCP&#8208;Raman effects is derived and multiple examples, which show strong eCP&#8208;Raman responses of solvents and the resonating chiral solutes, are discussed. Its usage in untangling complex excited state phenomena is also mentioned.







Abstract
This Concept article summarizes recent work on the development of a new form of chiral Raman spectroscopy, eCP&#8208;Raman, which combines two spectroscopies: electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and circularly polarized Raman (CP&#8208;Raman). First, some puzzling observations while carrying out Raman optical activity (ROA) measurements of several transition metal complexes under resonance are described, as well as the search for the mechanisms responsible. Then an equation for quantifying the eCP&#8208;Raman contribution is presented, followed by several examples of how eCP&#8208;Raman influences the IR&#8722;IL spectra of achiral and chiral solvent molecules and of a number of chiral solutes under resonance. The conditions to extract resonance ROA, when the eCP&#8208;Raman contribution is minimized, are also discussed. Finally, we comment on the potential applications of eCP&#8208;Raman.

         <title>Expedient Synthesis of Oxaboracyclic Compounds Based on Naphthalene and Biphenyl Backbone and Phase&#8208;Dependent Luminescence of their Chelate Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
General synthetic routes to a series of six&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered boracyclic systems based on naphthalene and biphenyl backbones were developed. Their physicochemical properties were comprehensively studied by NMR, X&#8208;ray and computational techniques. Strong phase&#8208;dependent variation in luminescent properties with quantum yields ranging from 10&#8211;95&#8201;% was observed for organoboron complex derived from 1&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1H,3H&#8208;naphtho[1,8&#8208;cd][1,2]oxaborinin&#8208;3&#8208;one.







Abstract
The approach to a series of six&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered oxaboraheterocycles based on naphthalene or biphenyl backbones was developed. The key synthetic step involved Br/Li exchange in respective potassium (bromoaryl)trifluoroborates followed by quenching with selected electrophiles (CO2, DMF, Me2Si(H)Cl) and hydrolytic workup. Two ring&#8208;expanded benzoxaborole congeners were obtained by an additional reduction step with LiAlH4 or NaBH4. The obtained boracyclic compounds were characterized in detail by NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Specifically, biphenyl&#8208;based systems show dynamic behaviour interpreted in terms of inversion of non&#8208;planar seven&#8208;membered boraheterocycles. The acidity of the obtained compounds varies very strongly (pKa ranges from 3.1&#8211;9.6) depending on their structure. Due to the enhanced boron Lewis acidity, selected compounds were used as a basis for luminescent complexes with 8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline. A strong phase&#8208;dependent variation of emission&#8208;band maximum (480&#8211;527&#8197;nm) and photoluminescence quantum yield (10&#8211;95&#8201;%) was observed, which was rationalized in terms of specific aggregation effects.

         <title>Femtosecond spectroscopy and nonlinear optical properties of aza&#8208;BODIPY derivatives in solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fast relaxation processes in the excited electronic states of functionalized aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (aza&#8208;BODIPY) derivatives (  1  &#8208;  4  ) were investigated in liquid media at room temperature, including the linear photophysical, photochemical, and nonlinear optical (NLO) properties. Optical gain was revealed for nonfluorescent derivatives  3  and  4  in the near infrared (NIR) spectral range under femtosecond excitation. The values of two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) and excited&#8208;state absorption (ESA) cross&#8208;sections were obtained for  1  &#8208;  4  in dichloromethane using femtosecond Z&#8208;scans, and the role of bromine substituents in the molecular structures of  2  and  4  is discussed. The nature of the excited states involved in electronic transitions of these dyes was investigated using quantum&#8208;chemical TD&#8208;DFT calculations. Significant 2PA (maxima cross&#8208;sections ~ 2000 GM), and large ESA cross&#8208;sections ~ 10  &#8208;20  m  2  of these new aza&#8208;BODIPY derivatives  1  &#8208;  4  along with their measured high photostability reveal their potential for photonic applications in general and optical limiting in particular.</dc:description>

         <title>Evidence of Kinetically Relevant Consistency in Thermal and Photo&#8208;thermal HCOOH Decomposition over Pd/LaCrO3/C3N4 Composite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photo&#8208;thermal catalysis has been an attractive alternative strategy to promote chemical reactions for years, however, how light cooperates with thermal energy is still unclear. We meet this demand by exploring reaction mechanism via pressure dependency studies as well as H/D exchange experiments with HCOOH decomposition as a probe over a palladium nanoparticle (Pd  n  ) and isolated Pd (Pd  1  ) decorated LaCrO  3  /C  3  N  4  composite catalyst, in which the H  2  formation rate shows a first&#8208;order dependence on HCOOH and inverse first&#8208;order dependence on CO partial pressures no matter the reaction was driven by thermal or photo&#8208;thermal energy. Additionally, negligible kinetic isotopic effects (KIEs: k  H  /k  D  ) were determined under both dark and light conditions at 1.04 and 1.18 when the HCOOH was replaced by HCOOD. Besides, when the reactant HCOOH was further replaced by DCOOD, the KIE values of 1.55 (dark) and 1.92 (light) was obtained, which indicates that the HCOOH decomposition follows kinetically relevant (KR) of C&#8208;H bond rupture within HCOOH molecule under both thermal and photo&#8208;thermal reactions and the catalytic surface was found to be densely covered by CO based on the pressure dependency studies as well as  in&#8208;situ  Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis. Clearly, the HCOOH decomposition driven by thermal and photo&#8208;thermal energy follows the same reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Explorations of New SHG Materials in Mercury Iodate Sulfate System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Through systematic experiments, two novel mercury iodate sulfates, namely, Hg  2  (IO  3  )  2  (SO  4  )(H  2  O) and Hg  2  (IO  3  )  2  (SO  4  ) have been obtained. They crystallize in monoclinic space group  C  2 and  C  2/  c  , respectively. Hg  2  (IO  3  )  2  (SO  4  )(H  2  O) exhibits the [Hg(IO  3  )]  +  polar cationic layer inherited from Hg(IO  3  )  2  and the threedimensional (3D) framework inherited from HgSO  4  . This enables Hg  2  (IO  3  )  2  (SO  4  )(H  2  O) to generate a strong second harmonic generation (SHG) response of 6 times that of KH  2  PO  4  (KDP). The structure of Hg  2  (IO  3  )  2  (SO  4  ) is very similar to that of Hg  2  (IO  3  )  2  (SO  4  )(H  2  O), and it features a 3D network composed of [Hg(IO  3  )]  +  cationic layers linked by bridging SO  4  2&#8208;  anions. Hg  2  (IO  3  )  2  (SO  4  )(H  2  O) shows a large optical band gap of 3.98 eV and a high dehydration temperature of 250&#176;C. This study indicates that by reasonable design, the introduction of multiple functional groups into a compound may combine their advantages to achieve good overall optical performance.</dc:description>

         <title>A Highly Stable Yttrium Organic Framework as a Host for Optical Thermometry and D2O Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The yttrium&#8208;organic framework (Y 0.89 Tb 0.10 Eu 0.01 ) 6 (BDC) 7 (OH) 4 (H 2 O) 4 (BDC = benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylate) is hydrothermally stable up to at least 513 K and thermally stable in air in excess of 673 K. The relative intensities of luminescence of Tb 3+ and Eu 3+ are governed by Tb 3+ &#8208;to&#8208;Eu 3+ phonon&#8208;assisted energy transfer and Tb 3+ &#8208;to&#8208;ligand back transfer and are responsible for the differing temperature&#8208;dependent luminescence of the two ions. This provides a ratiometric luminescent thermometer in the 288 &#8211; 573 K temperature range, not previously seen for MOF materials, with a high sensitivity, 1.69&#177;0.04% K &#8208;1 at 523 K. In aqueous conditions, loosely bound H 2 O can be replaced by D 2 O in the same material, which modifies decay lifetimes to yield a quantitative luminescent D 2 O sensor with a useful sensitivity for practical application</dc:description>

         <title>Control of Crystallinity of Vinylene&#8208;Linked Two&#8208;Dimensional Conjugated Polymers by Rational Monomer Design</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interest in two&#8208;dimensional conjugated polymers (2D CPs) has increased significantly in recent years. In particular, vinylene&#8208;linked 2D CPs with fully in&#8208;plane sp2&#8208;carbon&#8208;conjugated structures, high thermal and chemical stability, have become the focus of attention. Although the Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons (HWE) reaction has been recently demonstrated in synthesizing vinylene&#8208;linked 2D CPs, it remains largely unexplored due to the challenge in synthesis. In this work, we reveal the control of crystallinity of 2D CPs during the solvothermal synthesis of 2D&#8208;poly(phenylene&#8208;quinoxaline&#8208;vinylene)s (2D&#8208;PPQVs) and 2D&#8208;poly(phenylene&#8208;vinylene)s  via  the HWE polycondensation. The employment of fluorinated phosphonates and rigid aldehyde building blocks is demonstrated as crucial factors in enhancing the crystallinity of the obtained 2D CPs. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the critical role of the fluorinated phosphonate in enhancing the reversibility of the (semi)reversible C&#8208;C single bond formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Crystallization of Diamine Radical Cations: Carbon&#8208;Nitrogen Bond Formation from the Reaction of Triphenylamine with TiCl4, TiBr4, or SnCl4 vs Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Formation with SbCl5&#8224;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: We report the direct synthesis of diamine radical cations in crystalline form proceeding through oxidation of triphenylamine followed by the formation of a novel C&#8208;N bond. While the oxidative coupling of triphenylamine is well studied, diamine products are rarely captured in their radical cation state. The neutral diamine most frequently obtained from this reaction pathway is N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetraphenylbenzidine. Here, we have demonstrated the capture of radical cations of diamines in crystalline form in one step starting with neutral triphenylamine, and observed the formation of two products (the radical cations of N,N,N',N'&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzenediamine or N,N,N',N'&#8208;tetraphenylbenzidine) depending on the oxidizing agent used. The radical species are characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208; Ray diffraction, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and optical spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Road Toward More Efficient Biocompatible Two&#8208;Photon Excitable Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;photon absorption is a widely use process for bioimaging, as it allows to go deeper in tissue than conventional absorption and also limit photodamages. Unfortunately, classical dyes possess poor two&#8208;photon cross&#8208;sections. In this work, we developed a series of quadrupolar dyes and showed that these biocompatible probes exhibit high two&#8208;photon cross&#8208;sections (up to 3650&#8197;GM) and are therefore good candidates for two&#8208;photon bioimaging.







Abstract
Red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR absorption and emission wavelengths are key requirements for intravital bioimaging. One of the way to reach such excitation wavelengths is to use two&#8208;photon excitation. Unfortunately, there is still a lack of two&#8208;photon excitable fluorophores that are both efficient and biocompatible. Thus, we design a series of biocompatible quadrupolar dyes in order to study their ability to be used for live&#8208;cell imaging, and in particular for two&#8208;photon microscopy. Hence, we report the synthesis of 5 probes based on different donor cores (phenoxazine, acridane, phenazasiline and phenothiazine) and the study of their linear and non&#8208;linear photophysical properties. TD&#8208;DFT calculations were performed and were able to highlight the structure&#8208;property relationship of this series. All these studies highlight the great potential of three of these biocompatible dyes for two&#8208;photon microscopy, as they both exhibit high two&#8208;photon cross&#8208;sections (up to 3650&#8197;GM) and emit orange to red light. This potential was confirmed through live&#8208;cell two&#8208;photon microscopy experiments, leading to images with very high brightness and contrast.

         <title>S&#8208;(Trifluoromethyl)Benzothioate (TFBT): A KF&#8208;Based Reagent for Nucleophilic Trifluoromethylthiolation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
No need for HF: S&#8208;(Trifluoromethyl)benzothioate (TFBT), which is easily synthesized by using KF as the only fluorine source, has been developed as an inexpensive, bench&#8208;stable and user&#8208;friendly trifluoromethylthiolation reagent. TFBT reagent can readily release SCF3&#8722; with various counterions. The synthetic application of TFBT is demonstrated by trifluoromethylthiolation&#8208;halogenation of arynes, bis(trifluoromethylthiolation)&#8208;halogenation of 1,2&#8208;benzdiynes, nucleophilic substitution of alkyl halides, deoxytrifluoromethylthiolation of alcohols, and cross&#8208;coupling with aryl and vinyl boronic acids.

         <title>The Spin Modulation Stimulated Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction over LaCoO3 Perovskite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spin modulation strategy is proposed to improve the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction activity for perovskite oxide LaCoO3 (LCO), which was realized by adjusting the high temperature thermal reduction time. The prepared catalyst with optimized high temperature thermal reduction time of 60&#8197;min (LCO&#8208;60) exhibits more appropriate eg orbital occupation and shows significantly enhanced electrocatalytic oxygen evolution activity under an external magnetic field.







Abstract
Perovskite is a promising non&#8208;noble catalyst and has been widely investigated for the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, there is still serious lack of valid approaches to further enhance their catalytic performance. Herein, we propose a spin state modulation strategy to improve the OER electrocatalytic activity of typical perovskite material of LaCoO3. Specifically, the electronic configuration transition was realized by a simple high temperature thermal reduction process. M&#8208;H hysteresis loop results reveal that the reduction treatment can produce more unpaired electrons in 3d orbit by promoting the electron transitions of Co from low spin state to high spin state, and thus lead to the increase of the spin polarization. Electrochemical measurements show that the catalytic performance of LaCoO3 is strongly dependent on its electronic configuration. With the optimized reduction treatment, the overpotential for the OER process in 0.5&#8197;M KOH electrolyte solution at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 current density was 396&#8197;mV, significantly lower than that of the original state. Furthermore, it can mediate efficient OER with an overpotential of 383&#8197;mV under an external magnetic field, which is attributed to the appropriate electron filling. Our results show that electron spin state regulation is a new way to boost the OER electrocatalytic activity.

         <title>Effect of gem&#8208;difluorination on the key physicochemical properties relevant to medicinal chemistry: the case of functionalized cycloalkanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Physico&#8208;chemical properties important to drug discovery (pKa  , LogP, and aqueous solubility), as well as metabolic stability, were studied for a series of functionalized  gem&#8208;difluorinated cycloalkanes and compared to those of non&#8208;fluorinated and acyclic counterparts to evaluate the impact of the fluorination. It was found that the influence of the CF2&#160;moiety on the acidity/basicity of the corresponding carboxylic acids and amines was defined by inductive the effect of the fluorine atoms and was nearly the same for acyclic and cyclic aliphatic compounds. Lipophilicity and aqueous solubility followed more complex trends and were affected by the position of the fluorine atoms, ring size, and even the nature of the functional group present; also, significant differences were found for the acyclic and cyclic series. Also,  gem&#8208;difluorination either did not affect or slightly improved the metabolic stability of the corresponding model derivatives. The presented results can be used as a guide for rational drug design employing fluorine and establish the first chapter in a catalog of the key  in vitro  properties of fluorinated cycloalkanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Strengthening of the C&#8722;F Bond in Fumaryl Fluoride with Superacids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
F plus: The reaction of fumaryl fluoride with the superacids XF/MF5 (X=H, D; M=As, Sb) results in monoprotonated and diprotonated species: the first examples of a protonated acyl fluoride moiety. Surprisingly, the C&#8722;F bond lengths in the protonated cations are considerably shortened.







Abstract
The reaction of fumaryl fluoride with the superacidic solutions XF/MF5 (X=H, D; M=As, Sb) results in the formation of the monoprotonated and diprotonated species, dependent on the stoichiometric ratio of the Lewis acid to fumaryl fluoride. The salts [C4H3F2O2]+[MF6]&#8722; (M=As, Sb) and [C4H2X2F2O2]2+([MF6]&#8722;)2 (X=H, D; M=As, Sb) are the first examples with a protonated acyl fluoride moiety. They were characterized by low&#8208;temperature vibrational spectroscopy. Low&#8208;temperature NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure analyses were carried out for [C4H3F2O2]+[SbF6]&#8722; as well as for [C4H4F2O2]2+([MF6]&#8722;)2 (M=As, Sb). The experimental results are discussed together with quantum chemical calculations of the cations [C4H4F2O2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2&#8201;HF]2+ and [C4H3F2O2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HF]+ at the B3LYP/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ level of theory. In addition, electrostatic potential (ESP) maps combined with natural population analysis (NPA) charges were calculated in order to investigate the electron distribution and the charge&#8208;related properties of the diprotonated species. The C&#8722;F bond lengths in the protonated dication are considerably reduced on account of the +R effect.

         <title>Chiral Ligand&#8208;Driven Systematic Synthesis of Coordination Polymers with Non&#8208;centrosymmetric Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this Concept article, a systematic method to synthesize coordination polymers with macroscopic non&#8208;centrosymmetric structures by using chiral organic ligands as structure directing agents is provided. Our survey and analysis contain material design strategies, structure&#8208;driven SHG properties, and structure&#8208;property relationships. The importance of hyperpolarizability formed by intermolecular hydrogen boding interactions to SHG is emphasized. The topic could provide new insight into the target design and systematic synthesis of new functional materials with intriguing chemical and physical properties.







Abstract
Chirality is an important concept in chemistry revealing intriguing optical properties such as circular dichroism (CD), circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), etc. As one of the non&#8208;centrosymmetric (NCS) classes, chiral materials with extended structures may exhibit unique nonlinear optical (NLO) properties, such as second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG). In this Concept article, a series of recently discovered NCS coordination polymers (CPs) from use of carefully designed chiral organic ligands are reviewed. Combining several metal cations such as lanthanides, lead, zinc, and cadmium with rigid chiral ligands has resulted in interesting CPs with both polar and nonpolar structures. Detailed structures, SHG properties, and structure&#8208;property relationships are provided. The importance of hyperpolarizability formed by intermolecular hydrogen boding interactions to SHG is emphasized.

The intermediate incommensurate modulated structure of &#923;&#8208;cobalt (III) sepulchrate trinitrate is ordered yet retains amplitude of molecular rotations common to high temperature disordered as well as low temperature high Z&#8242; structure. Contributions from bifurcated N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O bonds as well as very short H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H contacts in addition to C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O bonds leads to severe frustrations in crystal packing than that in the lock&#8208;in phase.







Abstract
Phase transitions in molecular crystals are often determined by intermolecular interactions. The cage complex of [Co(C12H30N8)]3+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3&#8201;NO3&#8722; is reported to undergo a disorder&#8208;order phase transition at Tc1 &#8776;133&#8197;K upon cooling. Temperature&#8208;dependent neutron and synchrotron diffraction experiments revealed satellite reflections in addition to main reflections in the diffraction patterns below Tc1. The modulation wave vector varies as function of temperature and locks in at Tc3&#8776;98&#8197;K. Here, we demonstrate that the crystal symmetry lowers from hexagonal to monoclinic in the incommensurately modulated phases in Tc1&lt;T&lt;Tc3. Distinctive levels of competitions: trade&#8208;off between longer N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O and shorter C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bonds; steric constraints to dense C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O bonds give rise to pronounced modulation of the basic structure.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The intermediate incommensurate modulated structure&lt;/b&gt; of &#923;-cobalt (III) sepulchrate trinitrate is ordered yet retains amplitude of molecular rotations common to high temperature disordered as well as low temperature high &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;&#8242; structure. Contributions from bifurcated N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O bonds as well as very short H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H contacts in addition to C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O bonds leads to severe frustrations in crystal packing than that in the lock-in phase.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phase transitions in molecular crystals are often determined by intermolecular interactions. The cage complex of [Co(C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3&#8201;NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; is reported to undergo a disorder-order phase transition at &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;c1&lt;/sub&gt; &#8776;133&#8197;K upon cooling. Temperature-dependent neutron and synchrotron diffraction experiments revealed satellite reflections in addition to main reflections in the diffraction patterns below &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;c1&lt;/sub&gt;. The modulation wave vector varies as function of temperature and locks in at &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;c3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8776;98&#8197;K. Here, we demonstrate that the crystal symmetry lowers from hexagonal to monoclinic in the incommensurately modulated phases in &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;c1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;c3&lt;/sub&gt;. Distinctive levels of competitions: trade-off between longer N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O and shorter C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bonds; steric constraints to dense C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O bonds give rise to pronounced modulation of the basic structure. Severely frustrated crystal packing in the incommensurate phase is precursor to optimal balance of intermolecular interactions in the lock-in phase.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Catalysis on wheels: The beneficial effects of phosphine oxide additives on cobalt&#8208;catalysed reductive etherification enable the cobalt catalyst to &#8220;skate&#8221; from substrates (left) to products (right). The promoting effect further enables a milder and more general reaction, allowing a lower temperature and syngas (H2/CO) pressure as well as a broader scope.

         <title>Exploring the Association of Electron&#8208;Donating Corroles with Phthalocyanines as Electron Acceptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;covalent corrole&#8208;(Zn)phthalocyanine conjugates were afforded by mixing electron&#8208;donating 10&#8208;meso&#8208;pyridine corroles with an electron&#8208;accepting phthalocyanine. Investigation of the complexation by NMR, absorption, and fluorescence essays revealed binding constants as high as 106&#8201;m&#8722;1. Introducing non&#8208;covalent corrole&#8208;phthalocyanine linkages induces sizeable differences in the context of light harvesting and charge&#8208;transfer when compared to covalently linked equivalents.







Abstract
Electron&#8208;donating corroles (Cor) were integrated with electron&#8208;accepting phthalocyanines (Pc) to afford two different non&#8208;covalent Cor&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Pc systems. At the forefront was the coordination between a 10&#8208;meso&#8208;pyridine Cor and a ZnPc. The complexation was corroborated in a combination of NMR, absorption, and fluorescence assays, and revealed association with binding constants as high as 106&#8197;m&#8722;1. Steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopies evidenced that regardless of exciting Cor or Pc, the charge&#8208;separated state evolved efficiently in both cases, followed by a slow charge&#8208;recombination to reinstate the ground state. The introduction of non&#8208;covalent linkages between Cor and Pc induces sizeable differences in the context of light harvesting and transfer of charges when compared with covalently linked Cor&#8208;Pc conjugates.

Ferritin protein cages self&#8208;assemble electrostatically with cationic pillararenes into porous crystalline framework structures. The frameworks can simultaneously host inorganic and organic pollutants&#8212;the protein cage shows uptake of heavy metals such as CdII and AsV. In contrast, the pillar[5]arene shows selective recognition of methyl orange, a common organic dye. More information can be found in the Research Article by M.&#8197;A. Kostiainen et&#8197;al.

         <title>Disordered low molecular weight spiropyran exhibiting photoregulated adhesion ability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The functions of the materials composed of small molecules are highly dependent on their ordered molecular arrangements in both natural and artificial systems. Without ordered structure, small molecules hardly gain complicated functions, due to the absence of intermolecular covalent bond connection or strong network. Here, a low molecular weight spiropyran that could exhibit attractive photochromism and powerful adhesion property in disordered solid state is demonstrated. With maximum up to ~8 MPa, the adhesion strength could be photoregulated in multiple levels, which also shows one&#8208;to&#8208;one correspondence to the specific color state. The working mechanism analysis on the photoregulated adhesion reveals that the isomer ratio of merocyanine form and the molecular packing density of spiropyran are the determining factors for the adhesion ability. The discovery of photoregulated adhesion from pure spiropyran provides a new strategy for developing functional materials by employing low molecular weight compounds.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein a heterogeneous carbonyl alkylative amination has been developed that proceeds via photoredox catalysis. The use of nano titanium dioxide (TiO2, 25 nm) as photocatalyst allows for efficient synthesis of diverse amines in good to excellent yields.

         <title>Tuning Diradical Properties of Boron&#8208;Containing &#960;&#8208;Systems by Structural Isomerism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tuning diradical character is an important topic for organic diradicaloids. Herein, we report the precise borylation enabling structural isomerism as an effective strategy to modulate diradical character and thereby properties of organic diradicaloids. We synthesized a new B&#8208;containing polycyclic hydrocarbon that has the indeno[1,2&#8208;  b  ]fluorene &#960;&#8208;skeleton with the &#946;&#8208;carbons bonding to two boron atoms. Detailed theoretical and experimental results show that this bonding pattern leads to its distinctive electronic structures and properties in comparison to that of its isomeric molecule. This molecule has the efficient conjugation between boron atoms and &#960;&#8208;skeleton, resulting in downshifted LUMO and HOMO levels. Moreover, it exhibits smaller diradical character and thereby inhibited diradical properties, such as significantly blue&#8208;shifted light absorption, larger energy bandgap and weak para&#8208;magnetic resonance. Notably, this B&#8208;containing polycyclic hydrocarbon possesses much stronger Lewis acidity and its Lewis acid&#8208;base adducts display enhanced diradical character, demonstrating the positive effects of Lewis coordination on modulating diradical performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigating a Boronate&#8208;Affinity Guided Acylation Reaction for Labelling Native Antibodies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The excellent molecular recognition capabilities of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have opened up exciting opportunities for biotherapeutic discovery. Taking advantage of the full potential of this tool necessitates execution of affinity ligands capable of conjugating directly with small molecules to a defined degree of biorthogonality, especially when modifying natural Abs. Herein, a bioorthogonal boronate&#8208;affinity&#8208;based Ab ligand featuring a 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)pyridine and an S&#8208;aryl thioester to label full&#8208;length Abs is reported. The photoactivatable linker in the acyl donor facilitated purification of azide&#8208;labeled Ab (N  3  &#8208;Ab) quantitatively cleaved upon brief exposure to UV light while retaining the original Ab activity. Click reactions enabled precise addition of biotin, fluorophore, and a pharmacological agent to the purified N  3  &#8208;Abs. The resulting immunoconjugate showed effective cytotoxicity against targeted cells. Bioorthogonal traceless design and reagentless purification allow for this strategy to be a powerful tool to engineer native antibodies amenable to therapeutic intervention.</dc:description>

         <title>Helical chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands in enantioselective gold catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first chiral helicene&#8208;NHC gold(I) complexes efficient in enantioselective catalysis were prepared. The L&#8208;shaped chiral ligand is composed of an imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;ylidene (IPy) scaffold laterally&#8208;substituted by a configurationally stable [5]&#8208;helicenoid unit. The chiral information was introduced in a key post&#8208;functionalization step of a NHC&#8208;gold(I) complex bearing a symmetrical anionic fluoreno[5]helicene substituent, leading to a racemic mixture of complexes featuring three correlated elements of chirality, namely central, axial and helical chirality. After HPLC enantiomeric resolution, X&#8208;ray crystallography and theoretical calculations enabled structural and stereochemical characterization of these configurationally stable NHC&#8208;gold(I) complexes. The high potential in asymmetric catalysis is demonstrated in the benchmark cycloisomerization of N&#8208;tethered 1,6&#8208;enynes with up to 95:5 er.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequential visible light&#8208;induced reactions using different photocatalysts: Transformation of furans into 2&#8208;pyridones via &#947;&#8208;lactams using a new ring expansion reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new photocatalytic ring expansion reaction that transforms &#947;&#8208;lactams into 2&#8208;pyridones is described. The reaction is radical&#8208;triggered and was inspired by a late stage oxidation commonly observed in fungal metabolism. The reaction is particularly powerful because it can be included in a one pot process which converts readily accessible furans directly into 2&#8208;pyridones through sequential photo&#8208;induced reactions (energy transfer &amp; electron transfer). The study also unveiled unprecedented reactivity for the mild and metal&#8208;free photocatalyst eosin, wherein it is used to cleave a C&#8208;I bond activated only by an electron donor on the neighbouring carbon.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkali Metal Based Triimidosulfite Cages as Versatile Precursors for Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potassium and sodium cages [{S(tBuN)2(tBuNH)}2K3(tmeda)K3{(HNtBu)(NtBu)2S}2] (1), [S(tBuN)3(thf)3Na3SNa3(thf)3(NtBu)3S] (2) and [S(tBuN)3(thf)3Na3{(HNtBu)(NtBu)2S}] (3) serve as precursors to give f&#8208;metal single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMM). Especially, the sodium precursor 2 represents an ideal candidate and the subsequent dysprosium SMM [ClDy{Na(thf)}2{(NtBu)3S}2] (6) displays an energy barrier Ueff of 513&#8197;cm&#8722;1, a frequency dependency of the dynamic out&#8208;of&#8208;phase susceptibility up to 60&#8197;K and a butterfly hysteresis up to 7&#8197;K.







Abstract
Based on the potassium [{S(tBuN)2(tBuNH)}2K3(tmeda)&#8208;K3{(HNtBu)(NtBu)2S}2] (1) and sodium precursors [S(tBuN)3(thf)3&#8208;Na3SNa3(thf)3(NtBu)3S] (2), [S(tBuN)3(thf)3Na3{(HNtBu)(NtBu)2S}] (3) and [(tmeda)3S&#8208;{Na3(NtBu)3S}2] (4) the syntheses and magnetic properties of three mixed metal triimidosulfite based alkali&#8208;lanthanide&#8208;metal&#8208;cages [(tBuNH)Dy{K(0.5tmeda)}2{(NtBu)3S}2]n (5) and [ClLn{Na(thf)}2{(NtBu)3S}2] with Ln=Dy (6), Er (7) are reported. The corresponding potassium (1) and sodium (2&#8211;4) based cages are characterized through XRD and NMR experiments. Preventing lithium chloride co&#8208;complexation led to a significant increase of SMM performance to previously reported sulfur&#8208;nitrogen ligands. The subsequent DyIII&#8208;complexes 5 and 6 display slow relaxation of magnetization at zero field, with relaxation barriers U=77.0&#8197;cm&#8722;1 for 5, 512.9 and 316.3&#8197;cm&#8722;1 for 6, respectively. Significantly, the latter complex 6 also exhibits a butterfly&#8208;shaped hysteresis up to 7&#8197;K.

         <title>Capture of Gaseous Iodine in Isoreticular Zirconium&#8208;Based UiO&#8208;n Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Influence of Amino Functionalization, DFT Calculations, Raman and EPR Spectroscopic Investigation</title>

Conversion of I2 into I3&#8722; species trapped within UiO&#8208;n. The adsorption of gaseous iodine in UiO&#8208;n MOF&#8208;like materials has been systematically studied by analyzing kinetic curves. They show the conversion of trapped I2 into anionic species I3&#8722;, which is enhanced by the existence of amino groups functionalizing the organic linkers.







Abstract
A series of Zr&#8208;based UiO&#8208;n MOF materials (n=66, 67, 68) have been studied for iodine capture. Gaseous iodine adsorption was collected kinetically from a home&#8208;made set&#8208;up allowing the continuous measurement of iodine content trapped within UiO&#8208;n compounds, with organic functionalities (&#8722;H, &#8722;CH3, &#8722;Cl, &#8722;Br, &#8722;(OH)2, &#8722;NO2, &#8722;NH2, (&#8722;NH2)2, &#8722;CH2 NH2) by in&#8208;situ UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy. This study emphasizes the role of the amino groups attached to the aromatic rings of the ligands connecting the {Zr6O4(OH)4} brick. In particular, the preferential interaction of iodine with lone&#8208;pair groups, such as amino functions, has been experimentally observed and is also based on DFT calculations. Indeed, higher iodine contents were systematically measured for amino&#8208;functionalized UiO&#8208;66 or UiO&#8208;67, compared to the pristine material (up to 1211&#8197;mg/g for UiO&#8208;67&#8208;(NH2)2). However, DFT calculations revealed the highest computed interaction energies for alkylamine groups (&#8722;CH2NH2) in UiO&#8208;67 (&#8722;128.5&#8197;kJ/mol for the octahedral cavity), and pointed out the influence of this specific functionality compared with that of an aromatic amine. The encapsulation of iodine within the pore system of UiO&#8208;n materials and their amino&#8208;derivatives has been analyzed by UV&#8208;Vis and Raman spectroscopy. We showed that a systematic conversion of molecular iodine (I2) species into anionic I&#8722; ones, stabilized as I&#8722;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I2 or I3&#8722; complexes within the MOF cavities, occurs when I2@UiO&#8208;n samples are left in ambient light.

         <title>Directed Synthesis and Chemistry of Unsymmetric Dicationic Diboranes and Their Use in Frustrated Lewis Pair&#8208;like Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several new unsymmetric dicationic diboranes were synthesized and characterized by substitution reactions of two triflato groups by a phosphino&#8208;pyridine double Lewis base. The intermediate of one of these substitution reactions, in which only the pyridine base of the phosphino&#8208;pyridine is bound to the diboron unit, displays frustrated Lewis pair (FLP)&#8208;like chemistry. On the basis of the results, a new type of FLP chemistry is proposed, using for the first time dicationic diboranes as Lewis acidic component.







Abstract
The chemistry of dicationic diboranes with two BII atoms that are engaged in direct B&#8722;B bonding is by enlarge unexplored, although these molecules have intriguing properties due to their combined Lewis acidic and electron&#8208;donor properties. Unsymmetric dicationic diboranes are extremely rare, but especially attractive due to their polarized B&#8722;B bond. In this work we report the directed synthesis of several stable unsymmetric dicationic diboranes by reaction between the electron&#8208;rich ditriflato&#8208;diborane B2(hpp)2(OTf)2 (hpp=1,3,4,6,7,8&#8208;hexahydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrimido[1,2&#8208;&#945;]pyrimidinate) and phosphino&#8208;pyridines, establishing B&#8722;N and B&#8722;P bonds with the diborane concomitant with triflate elimination. In the case of 2&#8208;((ditertbutylphosphino)methyl)pyridine, the B&#8722;N bond is formed instantly, but the B&#8722;P bond formation requires (due to steric constraints) several days at ambient conditions for completion, creating an intermediate that could be used for frustrated Lewis pair (FLP)&#8208;like chemistry. Here we test its reaction with an aldehyde, and propose a new type of FLP&#8208;like chemistry.

         <title>Peroxidase&#8208;Mimetic Copper&#8208;Doped Carbon&#8208;Dots for Oxidative Stress&#8208;Mediated Broad&#8208;Spectrum and Efficient Antibacterial Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;sized, mono&#8208;dispersible, hydrophilic, and peroxidase&#8208;mimetic Cu&#8208;doped carbon dots (Cu&#8208;CDs) were prepared via one&#8208;pot hydrothermal carbonization. The harvested Cu&#8208;CDs permeated the cytomembrane and greatly promoted the catalytic oxidization of endogenous H2O2 into .OH and glutathione (GSH) depletion by oxidizing GSH into glutathione disulfide (GS&#8208;SG), resulting in the occurrence of oxidative stress and finally, death of bacteria.







Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) have recently emerged as antibacterial agents and have attracted considerable attention owing to their fascinating merits of small size, facile fabrication, and surface functionalization. Most of them are involved in external light activation or hybridization with other functional nanomaterials. Herein, we present peroxidase&#8208;like Cu&#8208;doped CDs (Cu&#8208;CDs) for in vitro antibacterial applications. The unique peroxidase&#8208;mimicking property of the Cu&#8208;CDs was demonstrated by tetramethylbenzidine chromogenic assay, electron paramagnetic resonance spectra, and hydroxy radical probe. Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were chosen as representative gram&#8208;negative/positive models against which Cu&#8208;CDs exhibited superior antimicrobial activity even at a dosage down to 5&#8197;&#956;g/mL. A possible mechanism of action was that the Cu&#8208;CDs triggered a catalytic redox reaction of endogenous H2O2 and glutathione depletion in the bacteria cells, with subsequent oxidative stress and membrane disruption. This work provides a new strategy for the design of microenvironment&#8208;responsive antimicrobial nano&#8208;agents.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Small-sized&lt;/b&gt;, mono-dispersible, hydrophilic, and peroxidase-mimetic Cu-doped carbon dots (Cu-CDs) were prepared via one-pot hydrothermal carbonization. The harvested Cu-CDs permeated the cytomembrane and greatly promoted the catalytic oxidization of endogenous H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into &lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;OH and glutathione (GSH) depletion by oxidizing GSH into glutathione disulfide (GS-SG), resulting in the occurrence of oxidative stress and finally, death of bacteria.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon dots (CDs) have recently emerged as antibacterial agents and have attracted considerable attention owing to their fascinating merits of small size, facile fabrication, and surface functionalization. Most of them are involved in external light activation or hybridization with other functional nanomaterials. Herein, we present peroxidase-like Cu-doped CDs (Cu-CDs) for in vitro antibacterial applications. The unique peroxidase-mimicking property of the Cu-CDs was demonstrated by tetramethylbenzidine chromogenic assay, electron paramagnetic resonance spectra, and hydroxy radical probe. &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; were chosen as representative gram-negative/positive models against which Cu-CDs exhibited superior antimicrobial activity even at a dosage down to 5&#8197;&#956;g/mL. A possible mechanism of action was that the Cu-CDs triggered a catalytic redox reaction of endogenous H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and glutathione depletion in the bacteria cells, with subsequent oxidative stress and membrane disruption. This work provides a new strategy for the design of microenvironment-responsive antimicrobial nano-agents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Isoxazolines: Method and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isoxazolines without the [3+2]: An electrochemical method for the synthesis of isoxazoline cores is presented. Both aryl and more challenging alkyl aldoximes are converted to the desired isoxazoline through an electrochemically enabled regio&#8208; and diastereoselective reaction with electron&#8208;deficient alkenes. Supporting analyses from kinetic (time&#8208;course) modelling and density functional theory support a stepwise, radical&#8208;mediated mechanism, and discount hypothesised involvement of closed&#8208;shell [3+2] cycloaddition pathways.







Abstract
An electrochemical method for the green and practical synthesis of a broad range of substituted isoxazoline cores is presented. Both aryl and more challenging alkyl aldoximes are converted to the desired isoxazoline in an electrochemically enabled regio&#8208; and diastereoselective reaction with electron&#8208;deficient alkenes. Additionally, in&#8208;situ reaction monitoring methods compatible with electrochemistry equipment have been developed in order to probe the reaction pathway. Supporting analyses from kinetic (time&#8208;course) modelling and density functional theory support a stepwise, radical&#8208;mediated mechanism, and discounts hypothesised involvement of closed shell [3+2] cycloaddition pathways.

         <title>Quadrupolar Ultrafast Charge Transfer in Diaminoazobenzene&#8208;Bridged Perylenediimide Triads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient quadrupolar charge transfer in diaminoazobenzene&#8208;bridged perylenediimide triads resulted in wide&#8208;band light capture. Charge&#8208;transfer emission was also possible to observe, and by fluorescence&#8208;spectroelectrochemistry it was possible to revert this phenomenon. Ultrafast quadrupolar charge transfer was confirmed by computational and femtosecond pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy in these triads.







Abstract
Strong push&#8208;pull interactions between electron donor, diaminoazobenzene (azo), and an electron acceptor, perylenediimide (PDI), entities in the newly synthesized A&#8722;D&#8722;A type triads (A=electron acceptor and D=electron donor) and the corresponding A&#8722;D dyads are shown to reveal wide&#8208;band absorption covering the entire visible spectrum. Electrochemical studies revealed the facile reduction of PDI and relatively easier oxidation of diaminoazobenzene in the dyads and triads. Charge transfer reversal using fluorescence&#8208;spectroelectrochemistry wherein the PDI fluorescence recovery upon one&#8208;electron oxidation, deterring the charge&#8208;transfer interactions, was possible to accomplish. The charge transfer state density difference and the frontier orbitals from the DFT calculations established the electron&#8208;deficient PDI to be an electron acceptor and diaminoazobenzene to be an electron donor resulting in energetically closely positioned PDI&#948;&#8722;&#8208;Azo&#948;+&#8208;PDI&#948;&#8722; quadrupolar charge&#8208;transfer states in the case of triads and Azo&#948;+&#8208;PDI&#948;&#8722; dipolar charge&#8208;transfer states in the case of dyads. Subsequent femtosecond transient absorption spectral studies unequivocally proved the occurrence of excited&#8208;state charge transfer in these dyads and triads in benzonitrile wherein the calculated forward charge transfer rate constants, kf, were limited to instrument response factor, meaning &gt;1012&#8197;s&#8722;1 revealing the occurrence of ultrafast photo&#8208;events. The charge recombination rate constant, kr, was found to depend on the type of donor&#8208;acceptor conjugates, that is, it was possible to establish faster kr in the case of triads (&#8764;1011&#8197;s&#8722;1) compared to dyads (&#8764;1010&#8197;s&#8722;1). Modulating both ground and excited&#8208;state properties of PDI with the help of strong quadrupolar and dipolar charge transfer and witnessing ultrafast charge transfer events in the studied triads and dyads is borne out from the present study.

         <title>Nanosized Carbon Macrocycles Based on a Planar Chiral Pseudo Meta&#8208;[2.2]Paracyclophane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of planar chiral pseudo meta&#8208; [2.2]paracyclophane with cycloparaphenylenes backbone leads to necklace&#8208;shaped chiral macrocycles, which exhibit unique photophysical properties with high fluorescence quantum yield of up to 82&#8201;%. In addition, size&#8208;dependent chiroptical properties with moderately large |glum| and CPL brightness BCPL value originating from the planar chirality of [2.2]paracyclophane were observed.







Abstract
Structural designs combining cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) backbone with planar chiral [2.2]paracyclophane ([2.2]PCP) lead to optical&#8208;active chiral macrocycles with intriguing properties. X&#8208;ray crystal analysis revealed aesthetic necklace&#8208;shaped structures and size&#8208;dependent packages with long&#8208;range channels. The macrocycles exhibit unique photophysical properties with high fluorescence quantum yield of up to 82&#8201;%, and the fluorescent color varies with ring size. In addition, size&#8208;dependent chiroptical properties with moderately large CPL dissymmetry factor of 10&#8722;3 and CPL brightness in the range of 30&#8211;40&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 were observed.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalysed Reductive Etherification Using Phosphine Oxide Promoters under Hydroformylation Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
No noble metal needed: The cobalt&#8208;catalysed reductive etherification of aldehydes with alcohols under syngas conditions has been investigated and proved to be efficient for a broad range of coupling partners. The promoting effect of phosphine oxides allows for a milder and more general reaction: the methodology presented a good functional group tolerance and could be applied to natural alcohols.







Abstract
A phosphine&#8208;oxide&#8208;promoted, cobalt&#8208;catalysed reductive etherification using syngas as a reductant is reported. This novel methodology was successfully used to prepare a broad range of unsymmetrical ethers from various aldehydes and alcohols containing diverse functional groups, and was scaled&#8208;up to multigram scale under comparably mild conditions. Mechanistic experiments support an acetalization&#8211;hydrogenation sequence.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework (MOF) Morphology Control by Design</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exerting morphological control over metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is critical for determining their catalytic performance and to optimize their packing behavior in areas from separations to fuel gas storage. A mechanism&#8208;based approach to tailor the morphology of MOFs is introduced and experimentally demonstrated for five cubic Zn  4  O&#8208;based MOFs. This methodology provides three key features: 1) computational screening for selection of appropriate additives to change crystal morphology based on knowledge of the crystal structure alone; 2) use of additive to metal cluster geometric relationships to achieve morphologies expressing desired crystallographic facets; 3) potential for suppression of interpenetration for certain phases.</dc:description>

         <title>Random Occupation of Multimetal Sites in Transition Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Boosting the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Less order, more action: Compared to single metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), the random occupation of multi&#8208;metal nodes in transitional MOFs builds a high&#8208;entropy state. Furthermore, this high&#8208;entropy&#8208;state MOFs caused a partial crystal distortion that can break up the catalytic atom&#8216;s saturated coordination environment to produce a highly active unsaturated state, optimizing the adsorption energies between oxygen intermediates and catalytic centres.







Abstract
Developing robust oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts with excellent performance is essential for the conversion of renewable electricity to clean fuel. Herein, we present a facile concept for the synthesis of efficient high&#8208;entropy metal&#8208;organic frameworks (HEMOFs) as electrocatalysts in a one&#8208;step solvothermal synthesis. This strategy allows control of the microstructure and corresponding lattice distortion by tuning the metal ion composition. As a result, the OER activity was improved by optimizing the coordination environment of the metal catalytic center. The optimized Co&#8208;rich HEMOFs exhibited a low overpotential of 310&#8197;mV at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, better than a RuO2 catalyst tested under the same conditions. The finding of lattice distortion of the HEMOFs provides a new strategy for developing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for energy conversion.

Gold&#8208;catalyzed 5&#8208;exo cyclization/oxidation and silver&#8208;promoted 6&#8208;endo cyclization of 2&#8208;(1&#8208;alkynyl)benzaldimines have been developed to synthesize 3&#8208;methyleneisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones and isoquinolinium salts, respectively. The two kinds of cyclization products could be transformed into isoindolinone&#8208;based benzocyclobutenes, isoquinolinones, 4&#8208;iodo&#8208;isoquinolin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;one, oxazatricycle, and tetrahydroisoquinoline.







Abstract
Coinage metal&#8208;promoted 5&#8208;exo and 6&#8208;endo selective cyclization of 2&#8208;(1&#8208;alkynyl)benzaldimines has been studied. It was found that, under gold catalysis, 2&#8208;(1&#8208;alkynyl)benzaldimines exclusively underwent 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization processes, followed by oxidation to form N&#8208;aryl 3&#8208;methyleneisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones. In contrast, in the presence of base and under activation of AgOTf, switching of 5&#8208;exo to 6&#8208;endo cyclizations of 2&#8208;(1&#8208;alkynyl)benzaldimines was observed, exclusively giving N&#8208;aryl or N&#8208;alkyl substituted isoquinolinium salts. The two key reaction intermediates, exocyclic vinyl&#8208;Au and the endocyclic vinyl&#8208;Ag species have been isolated and characterized, and a study of their reactivities confirms the plausible mechanisms. Reactions of the resultant 3&#8208;methyleneisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones with benzyne afforded structurally important isoindolinone&#8208;based benzocyclobutenes. Additionally, several interesting transformations of the resultant isoquinolinium salts have been investigated.

         <title>Activation by Glutathione in Hypoxic Environment of an Azo&#8208;based Rhodamine Activatable Photosensitizer. A Computational Elucidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mediated reduction: The mechanism of glutathione (GHS)&#8208;mediated reduction of the activatable photosensitizer azoSeRho to the active drug SeRho has been computationally elucidated and requires four GSH molecules to take place. The SeRho formation is favoured in hypoxic environment. The exploration of the SeRho photophysical properties have allowed to highlight its intrinsic properties that make is suitable to trigger type II photoreactions in photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
In the present paper, density functional theory (DFT) has been applied to the study of the activation mechanism of a new selenium azo&#8208;rhodamine (azoSeRho) in presence of the tripeptide thiol, glutathione (GSH), as potent activatable photosensitizer to be employed in photodynamic therapy. The introduction of the azo group into the conjugated system of the seleno&#8208;rhodamine dye and its reaction with GSH allow the selective formation of the active photosensitizer, SeRho. Furthermore, DFT calculations have allowed to shed light on the activation mechanism of the azoSeRho photosensitizer when molecular oxygen is present and hydrogen peroxide is formed. This study is the first theoretical investigation revealing how the reductive cleavage of the azo moiety by GSH occurs. Time&#8208;dependent DFT approach has been used to evaluate the chalcogen&#8208;substitution effect on the structures and photophysical properties of the azo derivatives and, then, on the activated photosensitizers.

         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis of Variediene Analogs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Five DMAPP analogs with additional carbon atoms or with changed methylation patterns were converted with IPP and the bifunctional variediene synthase from Aspergillus brasiliensis AbVS to yield diterpene analogs with unusual skeletons. The DMAPP analogs opened new reaction pathways through the stabilisation of cationic charges at alternative carbon atoms that are naturally not observed.







Abstract
Five analogs of dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) with additional or shifted Me groups were converted with isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and the fungal variediene synthase from Aspergillus brasiliensis (AbVS). These enzymatic reactions resulted in the formation of several new terpene analogs that were isolated and structurally characterised by NMR spectroscopy. Several DMAPP analogs showed a changed reactivity giving access to compounds with unusual skeletons. Their formation is mechanistically rationalised and the absolute configurations of all obtained compounds were determined through a stereoselective deuteration strategy, revealing absolute configurations that are analogous to that of the natural enzyme product variediene.

         <title>Synthesis, Reactivity and Structural Properties of Trifluoromethylphosphoranides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different trifluoromethylated phosphoranides are accessible upon treatment of trifluoromethylated phosphanes, such as P(CF3)3, with a source of F&#8722; or CF3&#8722; in presence of a stabilizing counterion. The hypervalent compounds have been investigated by NMR spectroscopic as well as X&#8208;ray crystallographic methods, gaining insights into their stability and structural behavior. In addition, the phosphoranides have revealed fluorinating and trifluoromethylating properties towards electrophiles.







Abstract
Phosphoranides are interesting hypervalent species which serve as model compounds for intermediates or transition states in nucleophilic substitution reactions at trivalent phosphorus substrates. Herein, the syntheses and properties of stable trifluoromethylphosphoranide salts are reported. [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][P(CF3)4], [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][P(CF3)3F], and [NMe4][P(CF3)2F2] were obtained by treatment of trivalent precursors with sources of CF3&#8722; or F&#8722; units. These [P(CF3)4&#8208;nFn]&#8722; (n=0&#8211;2) salts exhibit fluorinating (n=1&#8211;2) or trifluoromethylating (n=0) properties, which is disclosed by studying their reactivity towards selected electrophiles. The solid&#8208;state structures of [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][P(CF3)4] and [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][P(CF3)3F] are ascertained by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The dynamics of these compounds are investigated by variable temperature NMR spectroscopy.

         <title>Kinase Sensing Based on Protein Interactions at the Catalytic Site</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical biosensor, based on the interaction between the catalytic site of the kinase and the phosphorylation site of its substrate for detection, is described. The phosphorylation site peptide of HDGF, a substrate of ERK2, was absorbed on gold electrodes to electrochemically sense ERK2 without ATP. Surface chemistry analysis showed that ERK2 was bound to the peptide monolayer, which changed the packing of the layer, resulting in increased permeability of redox&#8208;active species through the layer and electrochemical sensing.







Abstract
The role kinases play in regulating cellular processes makes them potential biomarkers for detecting the onset and prognosis of various diseases, including many types of cancer. Current kinase biosensors, including electrochemical and radiometric methods, rely on sensing the ATP&#8208;dependant enzymatic phosphorylation reaction. Here we introduce a new type of interaction&#8208;based electrochemical kinase biosensor that does not require any chemical labelling or modification. The basis for sensing is the interactions between the catalytic site of the kinase and the phosphorylation site of its substrate rather than the phosphorylation reaction. We demonstrated this concept with the ERK2 kinase and its substrate protein HDGF, which is involved in lung cancer. A peptide monolayer derived from the HDGF phosphorylation site was adsorbed onto a gold electrode and was used to sense ERK2 without ATP. The sensitivity of the assay was down to 10&#8197;nM of ERK2, corresponding with the range of its cellular concentrations. Surface chemistry analysis confirmed that ERK2 was bound to the HDGF peptide monolayer. This increased the permeability of redox&#8208;active species through the monolayer and resulted in ERK2 electrochemical sensing. Since our detection approach is based on protein&#8208;protein interactions and not on the enzymatic reaction, it can be further utilized for more selective detection of different types of enzymes.

         <title>Dielectric and Magnetic Relaxations Exhibited in 2D Parallel Interpenetrating Frustrated Star Net</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing multiple functional geometric frustration magnets is a hot topic in solid state chemistry and material science. Herein, a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) parallel interpenetrating &#8220;star&#8221; net complex [HDMPDA][Fe  6  (  &#956;  3  &#8208;O)  2  (  &#956;  &#8208;O  2  CH)  15  ] (  1  ) was obtained successfully with HDMPDA (DMPDA = N, N&#8217;&#8208; dimethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;propanediamine) as charge balancer. The dipole reorientation of the rotator [HDMPDA]  +  in the complex brings a structure transition which leads dielectric relaxation close to room temperature. Despite strong antiferromagnetic coupling existing between ions in the net, long&#8208;range order temperature T  N  of the complex is suppressed to 4.2 K by geometric frustration. Interestingly, below T  N  , a canted antiferromagnetic state, accompanied with slow magnetic relaxation, is detected due to the lack of enough magnetic coupling between 2D layers. Thus,  1  is a particular multifunctional magnetic frustration material containing two different types of relaxations.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The silver&#8208;promoted reaction of tertiary cyclobutanols with  N  &#8208;methoxypyridinium salts enables the efficient synthesis of a range of C2&#8208;substituted pyridines. The overall process likely occurs by ring&#8208;opening (via  &#946;  &#8208;scission) of the tertiary cyclobutanol to generate the corresponding  &#947;  &#8208;keto alkyl radical that itself adds to the pyridinium salt. A wide range of tertiary cyclobutanols and  N  &#8208;methoxypyridinium salts are compatible with these reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>A Unified Mechanism for the PhCOCOOH&#8208;mediated Photochemical Reactions: Revisiting its Action and Comparison to Known Photoinitiators</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since 2014, we have introduced in literature the use of phenylglyoxylic acid (PhCOCOOH), a small and commercially available organic molecule, as a potent promoter in a variety of photochemical processes. Although PhCOCOOH has a broad scope of photochemical reactions that can promote, the understanding of its mode of action in our early contributions was moderate. Herein, we are restudying and revisiting the mechanism of action of PhCOCOOH in most of these early contributions, providing a unified mechanism of action. Furthermore, the understanding of its action as a photoinitiator opened a new comparison study with known and commercially available photoinitiators.</dc:description>

         <title>Glyoxal&#8208;Linked Nucleotides and DNA for Bioconjugations and Crosslinking with Arginine&#8208;Containing Peptides and Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Protein probes: Phenylglyoxal&#8208;linked dNTPs have been designed and synthesized by using two different approaches &#8211; CuAAC and Sonogashira reactions &#8211; that are compatible with the highly reactive glyoxal moiety. These nucleotides were shown to be good substrates for the enzymatic construction of DNA probes for crosslinking with Arg&#8208;containing peptides or proteins.







Abstract
Glyoxal&#8208;linked 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyuridine 5&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;mono&#8208; and triphosphates were synthesized through a CuAAC click reaction of 4&#8208;azidophenylglyoxal or a Sonogashira reaction of 4&#8208;bromophenylglyoxal with 5&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;dUMP or &#8208;dUTP. The triphosphates were used as substrates for enzymatic synthesis of modified DNA probes with KOD XL DNA polymerase. The glyoxal&#8208;linked nucleotides reacted with arginine&#8208;containing peptides to form stable imizadolone&#8208;linked conjugates. This reactive glyoxal modification in DNA was used for efficient bioconjugations and crosslinking with Arg&#8208;containing peptides or proteins (e.&#8201;g., histones) and was found to be more reactive than previously reported 1,3&#8208;diketone&#8208;linked DNA probes.

         <title>Acetylene Derivatives of Cationic Diazaoxatriangulenes and Diaza [4]Helicenes &#8208; Access to Red Emitters and Planar Chiral Stereochemical Traits</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cationic diazaoxa triangulene and [4]helicene cores were functionalized with alkynyl substituents to form effective dyes and fluorophores with red&#8208;shifted absorptions (&#916;&#955;abs up to 25&#8197;nm) and emissions (&#916;&#955;em up to 73&#8197;nm, &#934;PL up to 51&#8201;%). It is further shown that compounds made of achiral DAOTA skeletons present an original dynamic stereoisomerism with a barrier of &#8764;12&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for the propyl rotation between planar chiral conformations (VT&#8197;NMR, DFT studies).







Abstract
Cationic triangulenes, and related helicenes, constitute a rich class of dyes and fluorophores, usually absorbing and emitting light at low energy, in the orange to red domains. Recently, to broaden the scope of applications, regioselective late&#8208;stage functionalizations on these core moieties have been developed. For instance, with the introduction of electron&#8208;donating groups (EDGs), important bathochromic shifts are observed pushing absorptions towards or in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectral domain while emissive properties disappear essentially completely. Herein, to upset this drawback, acetylene derivatives of cationic diazaoxa triangulenes (DAOTA) and [4]helicenes are prepared (16 examples). Contrary to other EDG&#8208;functionalized derivatives, C&#8801;C&#8722; functionalized products remain broadly fluorescent, with red&#8208;shifted absorptions (&#916;&#955;abs up to 25&#8197;nm) and emissions (&#916;&#955;em up to 73&#8197;nm, &#934;PL up to 51&#8201;%). Quite interestingly, a general dynamic stereoisomerism phenomenon is evidenced for the compounds derived from achiral DAOTA cores. At low temperature in 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy (218&#8197;K), N&#8722;CH2 protons become diastereotopic with chemical shifts differences (&#916;&#948;) as high as +1.64&#8197;ppm. The signal coalescence occurs around 273&#8197;K with a barrier of &#8764;12&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. This phenomenon is due to planar chiral conformations (Sp and Rp configurations), induced by the geometry of the alkyl (n&#8208;propyl) side&#8208;chains next to the acetylenic substituents. Ion pairing studies with &#916;&#8208;TRISPHAT anion not only confirm the occurrence of the chiral conformations but evidence a moderate but definite asymmetric induction from the chiral anion onto the cations. Finally, DFT calculations offer a valuable insight on the geometries, the corresponding stereodynamics and also on the very large difference in NMR for some of the diastereotopic protons.

         <title>Structure&#8208; and Interaction&#8208;Based Design of Anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Aptamers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Applying computational methods together with experimental procedures can speed up aptamer design. By using a new iterative design procedure, structure and interaction&#8208;based drug design (SIBDD), a highly specific aptamer to the receptor&#8208;binding domain of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein, was designed and validated. The approach combines molecular dynamics with quantum chemistry to estimate binding affinity in silico with in&#8197;vitro verification.







Abstract
Aptamer selection against novel infections is a complicated and time&#8208;consuming approach. Synergy can be achieved by using computational methods together with experimental procedures. This study aims to develop a reliable methodology for a rational aptamer in silico et vitro design. The new approach combines multiple steps: (1) Molecular design, based on screening in a DNA aptamer library and directed mutagenesis to fit the protein tertiary structure; (2) 3D molecular modeling of the target; (3) Molecular docking of an aptamer with the protein; (4) Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the complexes; (5) Quantum&#8208;mechanical (QM) evaluation of the interactions between aptamer and target with further analysis; (6) Experimental verification at each cycle for structure and binding affinity by using small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, cytometry, and fluorescence polarization. By using a new iterative design procedure, structure&#8208; and interaction&#8208;based drug design (SIBDD), a highly specific aptamer to the receptor&#8208;binding domain of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein, was developed and validated. The SIBDD approach enhances speed of the high&#8208;affinity aptamers development from scratch, using a target protein structure. The method could be used to improve existing aptamers for stronger binding. This approach brings to an advanced level the development of novel affinity probes, functional nucleic acids. It offers a blueprint for the straightforward design of targeting molecules for new pathogen agents and emerging variants.

         <title>Strain&#8208;induced Ring Expansion Reactions of Calix[3]pyrrole&#8208;related Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recent discovery of calix[3]pyrrole, a porphyrinogen&#8208;like tripyrrolic macrocycle, has provided an unprecedented strain&#8208;induced ring expansion reaction into calix[6]pyrrole. Here, we synthesized calix[n]furan[3&#8211;n]pyrrole (n = 1~3) macrocycles to investigate the reaction scope and mechanism of the ring expansion. Single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis and theoretical calculations revealed that macrocyclic ring strain increases as the number of inner NH sites increases. While calix[1]furan[2]pyrrole exhibited almost quantitative conversion into calix[2]furan[4]pyrrole within 5 minutes, less&#8208;strained calix[2]furan[1]pyrrole and calix[3]furan were inert. However, N&#8208;methylation of calix[2]furan[1]pyrrole induced a ring&#8208;expansion reaction that enabled the isolation of a linear reaction intermediate. The mechanism analysis revealed that the ring expansion consists of regioselective ring cleavage and subsequent cyclodimerization. This reaction was further utilized for synthesis of calix[6]&#8208;type macrocycles.</dc:description>

An unprecedented catalytic protocol for the asymmetric decarbonylative transformation: The cover art depicts how the asymmetric reaction of the Ir/S&#8722;Me&#8208;BIPAM complex takes precedence over the decarbonylation. The picture of the balance shows that the competing decarbonylation side reaction will not happen, as well as highlighting the asymmetry. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Shirai et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104347).

         <title>The recent progress of prelithiation reagents and strategies on high energy Lithium&#8208;ion batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) have been widely employed in energy storage applications owing to the relatively higher energy density and longer cycling life, while on the other hand, they still need further improvement especially on the energy density to satisfy the increasing demands on the market. In this respect, the irreversible capacity loss (ICL) in the initial cycle is a critical challenge due to the lithium loss during the formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the anode surface. The strategy of prelithiation was then proposed to compensate for the ICL in anode and recover the energy density. Here, various methods of the prelithiation are summarized and classified according to the basic working mechanism. Further, considering the critical importance and promising progress of prelithiation in both fundamental research and real applications, this review is intended to discuss the considerations on the selection of prelithiation reagents/strategies and the electrochemical performance in full&#8208;cells. Moreover, insights are provided regarding the practical application prospects and the challenges that still need to be addressed.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition Metal Catalyst free Synthesis of Olefins from Organoboron Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stereoselective preparation of highly substituted olefins is still a severe challenge that requires well defined elimination precursors. Organoboron chemistry is particularly suited for the preparation of molecules with adjacent stereocenters. As organo boron substrates with leaving groups in b&#8208;position can undergo stereospecific  syn  &#8208; or  anti  &#8208;elimination, this chemistry harbors great potential for the synthesis of complex olefins. In recent years three main strategies emerged, which differ in their approach to the b&#8208;functionalized organoboron elimination precursor. (i) Stereoselective preparation of such elimination precursor can be achieved by addition of a boron&#8208;stabilized anion (d  1  ) to an aldehyde or ketone (a  1  ) or diastereoselective 1,3&#8208;rearrangement of suitable boron&#8208;ate&#8208;complexes. Stereospecific methods rely either on (ii)&#160;diastereospecific 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangement of boron&#8208;ate&#8208;complexes that involve opening of appropriate heterocycles or (iii) addition of chiral carbenoids (d  1  *) to chiral boronates (a  1  *) with a leaving group in a&#8208;position.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards Nitrogen Rich N&#8208;Heteropolycycles: Synthesis of Octaazaperopyrenes (OAPP)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ortho  substituted octaazaperopyrenes (OAPPs) are a new class of functional dyes characterized by their strong electron accepting behavior. Here, the synthesis as well as the electrochemical and photo physical properties of an OAPP dye is reported. The OAPP target was prepared via selective nucleophilic substitution at the  peri  position of a  bay  chlorinated tetraazaperylene by introduction of four amino&#8208;substituents. The resulting tetraminoperylene was reacted with different acyl chlorides and anhydrides to give the twisted  bay  chlorinated OAPP derivatives which were isolated in their reduced dihydro&#8208;form. The OAPP target could be obtained via a palladium catalyzed dehalogenation and a subsequent oxidation. The eightfold isosteric [CH&#8594;N] replacement within the peropyrene core structure results in a large decrease of the frontier orbital energies, rendering the target compound a potent oxidant while preserving the planarity of the aromatic core. The radical anion was obtained by reduction of the OAPP with KC  8  and characterized via EPR&#8208;spectroscopy. A general discussion of the number and location of [CH&#8594;N] replacements in peropyrene structures and their frontier orbital energies is provided.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A methodology for the C&#8208;H azidation of N &#8208;terminal proline&#8208;containing peptides was developed employing only commercially available reagents. Peptides bearing a broad range of functionalities and containing up to 6 amino acids were selectively azidated at the carbamate&#8208;protected N &#8208;terminal residue in presence of the numerous other functional groups present on the molecules. Post&#8208;functionalizations of the obtained aminal compounds were achieved: Cycloaddition reactions or C&#8208;C bond formations via a sequence of imine formation/nucleophilic addition were performed, offering an easy access to diversified peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>Ene&#8208;Reductase: A Multifaceted Biocatalyst in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biocatalysis integrate microbiologists, enzymologists, and organic chemists to access the repertoire of pharmaceutical and agrochemicals with high chemoselectivity, regioselectivity, and enantioselectivity. The saturation of carbon&#8208;carbon double bonds by biocatalysts challenge the conventional chemical methodology as it bypasses the use of precious metals (in combination with chiral ligands and molecular hydrogen) or organocatalysts. In this line, Ene&#8208;reductases (ERs) from the Old Yellow Enzymes (OYEs) family are found to be a prominent asymmetric biocatalyst that is increasingly used in academia and industries towards unparalleled stereoselective  trans  &#8208;hydrogenations of activated C=C bonds. ERs gained prominence as they were used as individual catalysts, multi&#8208;enzyme cascades, and in conjugation with chemical reagents (chemoenzymatic approach). Besides, ERs&#8217; participation in the photoelectrochemical and radical&#8208;mediated process helps to unlock many scopes outside traditional biocatalysis. These up&#8208;and&#8208;coming methodologies entice the enzymologists and chemists to explore, expand and harness the chemistries displayed by ERs for industrial settings. Herein, we reviewed the last five year&#8217;s exploration of organic transformations using ERs.</dc:description>

         <title>An alternate [2&#215;2] grid constructed around TiO4N2 units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of a tetranuclear self&#8208;assembled species constructed around a TiO  4  N  2  motif is reported. This aggregate is generated from Ti(O  i  Pr)  4  , 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyrimidine (bpym) and a bisbiphenol strand (L  2  H  4  ) where two 2,2&#8217;&#8208;biphenol units are connected with a biphenyl spacer. The solid&#8208;state structure of the [Ti  4  (L  2  )  4  (bpym)  4  ] architecture reveals the formation of an unprecedented chiral alternate [2&#215;2] grid. In addition to the structural characterization of the [Ti  4  (L  2  )  4  (bpym)  4  ] architecture, geometry optimisation on various possible isomeric tetrameric assemblies ([2&#215;2] grid, alternate [2x2] grid, circular helicate or cyclic hemihelicate) is performed using DFT calculations. These results confirm the higher stability of the alternate [2x2] grid over the other possible tetranuclear isomers and allow examining the replacement of the bpym ligands by two novel diimine chelates within the tetranuclear assembly (2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine = bipy and 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyrazine = bipyraz). From this initial theoretical investigation, the competition between these three nitrogen ligands in the course of the selfassembly process is next evaluated. Overall, this investigation shows that the exclusive formation of the alternate [2x2] grid is driven by CH&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;N interactions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Light&#8208;emitting systems using an RNA aptamer&#8722;dye pair, such as Spinach RNA, are an attractive method for imaging and tracing RNA expression  in vitro  and  in vivo  . We present an alternative Spinach method by genetic alphabet expansion using an unnatural base pair system, in which a dye&#8208;conjugated unnatural base substrate is site&#8208;specifically incorporated at a specific position in Spinach RNA by transcription involving the third base pair. The incorporation position was predicted by molecular dynamics simulations. This dye&#8208;conjugated Spinach RNA increased the thermal stability of the fluorescence, the robustness against ion sensitivity, and the resistance against photobleaching. Furthermore, we applied our method to Baby Spinach, a shorter version of Spinach, for dye conjugation toward the visible detection of transcripts. This is the first demonstration of an alternative RNA imaging method for a detection system using genetic alphabet expansion.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the (Chir)Optical Properties and Squeezing out the Inherent Chirality in Polyphenylene&#8208;Locked Helical Carbon Nanorings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports the precise synthesis and tuning size&#8208;dependent (chir)optical properties of chiral distorted acenes ([n]CPPAn2,6; n=6&#8211;8). Efficient resolutions for chiral enantiomers with (P)/(M)&#8208;helicity were achieved only when the size is small. These enantiomers showed strong chiroptical properties and dissymmetry factors (|gabs| and |glum|&#8764;0.01 for an enantiomer of [6]CPPAn2,6).







Abstract
Distorting linear polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) out of planarity affects their physical properties and breaks their symmetry to induce inherent chirality. However, the chirality cannot be achieved in large distorted PAHs&#8208;based macrocycles due to a low racemization barrier for isomerization. Herein, we report the precise synthesis and tuning size&#8208;dependent (chir)optical properties of a new class of chiral PAHs&#8208;containing conjugated macrocycles (cyclo[n]paraphenylene&#8208;2,6&#8208;anthrylene, [n]CPPAn2,6; n=6&#8211;8). Their inherent chiralities were squeezed out in small anthrylene&#8208;based macrocycles. Efficient resolutions for chiral enantiomers with (P)/(M)&#8208;helicity of small [6&#8208;7]CPPAns were achieved by HPLC. Interestingly, these macrocycles showed enriched size&#8208;dependent physical, chiral, and (chir)optical properties. Theoretical calculations indicate that these macrocycles have high strain energy (Estrain=60.8 to 73.4&#8197;kcal/mol) and very small Egap (&#8764;3.0&#8197;eV). Notably, these enantiomers showed strong chiroptical properties and dissymmetry factors (|gabs| and |glum|&#8764;0.01 for an enantiomer of [6]CPPAn2,6), which can give them potential applications in optically active materials.

         <title>Binding Interactions in Copper, Silver and Gold &#960;&#8208;Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The binding between coinage metal complexes and alkenes or alkynes is affected in a non&#8208;intuitive way by electron withdrawing substituents at the ancillary ligands. Investigation in solution, solid&#8208;state, and gas&#8208;phase gives an insight into the nature of these interactions. Metal&#8208;alkene/alkyne binding energies increase in the order Ag&lt;Cu&lt;Au and they are slightly higher for alkynes than for alkenes. The &#960;&#8208;back bonding interaction is particularly dominant in the gold complexes. Accordingly, the electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents at the ancillary ligands weaken the gold&#8208;alkene/alkyne bonding.







Abstract
The copper(I), silver(I), and gold(I) metals bind &#960;&#8208;ligands by &#963;&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;back bonding interactions. These interactions were investigated using bidentate ancillary ligands with electron donating and withdrawing substituents. The &#960;&#8208;ligands span from ethylene to larger terminal and internal alkenes and alkynes. Results of X&#8208;ray crystallography, NMR, and IR spectroscopy and gas phase experiments show that the binding energies increase in the order Ag&lt;Cu&lt;Au and the binding energies are slightly higher for alkynes than for alkenes. Modulation of the electron density at the metal using substituents on the ancillary ligands shows that the &#960;&#8208;back bonding interaction plays a dominant role for the binding in the copper and gold complexes.

         <title>Carbodiimide&#8208;Driven Dimerization and Self&#8208;Assembly of Artificial, Ribose&#8208;Based Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two types of artificial ribose&#8208;based amphiphiles have been prepared and self&#8208;assembled into various supramolecular structures, exhibiting aggregation&#8208;induced emission. The molecularly dissolved amphiphiles can be converted selectively into dimeric pyrophosphates in the presence of carbodiimide EDC, giving rise to helical fibers with lengths at the micrometer scale.







Abstract
The aqueous self&#8208;assembly of amphiphiles into aggregates such as micelles and vesicles has been widely investigated over the past decades with applications ranging from materials science to drug delivery. The combination of characteristic properties of nucleic acids and amphiphiles is of substantial interest to mimic biological self&#8208;organization and compartmentalization. Herein, we present ribose&#8208; and ribonucleotide&#8208;based amphiphiles and investigate their self&#8208;assembly as well as their fundamental reactivity. We found that various types of aggregates are formed, ranging in size from nanometers to micrometers and all amphiphiles exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) in solution as well as in the solid state. We also observed that the addition of 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;(3&#8208;dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) leads to rapid and selective dimerization of the amphiphiles into pyrophosphates, which decreases the critical aggregation concentration (CAC) by a factor of 25 when compared to the monomers. Since the propensity for amphiphile dimerization is correlated with their tendency to self&#8208;assemble, our results may be relevant for the formation of rudimentary compartments under prebiotic conditions.

         <title>Asymmetric synthesis of heterocyclic chloroamines and aziridines by enantioselective protonation of catalytically generated enamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a method for the synthesis of chiral vicinal chloroamines via asymmetric protonation of catalytically generated prochiral chloroenamines using chiral Br&#248;nsted acids. The process is highly enantioselective, with the origin of asymmetry and catalyst substituent effects elucidated by DFT calculations. We show the utility of the method as an approach to the synthesis of a broad range of heterocycle&#8208;substituted aziridines by treatment of the chloroamines with base in a one&#8208;pot process, as well as the utility of the process to allow access to vicinal diamines.</dc:description>

         <title>Vinylcyclopropane [3+2] Cycloaddition with Acetylenic Sulfones Based on Visible Light Photocatalysis**</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the first intermolecular visible light [3+2] cycloaddition reaction performed on a  meta  photocycloadduct employing acetylenic sulfones. The developed methodology exploits the advantages of combining UV and visible&#8208;light in a two&#8208;step sequence that provides a photogenerated cyclopropane which, through a strain&#8208;release process, generates a new cyclopentane ring while significantly increasing the molecular complexity. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations indicate an energy transfer pathway for the visible light&#8208;driven reaction step. This strategy could be extended to simpler vinylcyclopropanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Induced Near&#8208;Infrared Emission and Controlled Photooxidation Based on Sulfonated Crown Ether in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulation of physio&#8208;chemical properties and reaction activities via noncovalent methodology has become one of increasingly significant topics in supramolecular chemistry, and showed inventive applications in miscellaneous fields. Herein, we demonstrate that sulfonated crown ether can form very stable host&#8211;guest complexes with a series of push&#8211;pull&#8208;type photosensitizers, eventually leading to the dramatic fluorescence enhancement in visible and near&#8208;infrared regions. Meanwhile, severe suppression in singlet oxygen (  1  O  2  ) production is found, mainly due to the higher energy barriers between the excited single and triple states upon host&#8211;guest complexation. Moreover, such complexation&#8208;induced tunable  1  O  2  generation systems has been utilized in adjusting the photochemical oxidation reactions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (anthracene) and sulfides ((methylthio)benzene) in water. This supramolecularly controlled photooxidation based on the selective molecular binding of crown ether with photosensitizers may provide a feasible and applicable strategy for monitoring and modulating many photocatalysis processes in aqueous phase.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Insights on the Mechanosynthesis of Phenytoin, a WHO Essential Medicine**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ monitoring by Raman spectroscopy of the mechanosynthesis of phenytoin, a World Health Organization Essential Medicine, is reported. This study enabled the observation, isolation and characterization of key molecular&#8208;migration intermediates involved in the transformation of benzil (1), urea (2), and KOH into phenytoin (3). The depth of this investigation answers scientifically interesting questions, which might be helpful for the propulsion of mechanosynthetic protocols among mainstream methodologies for synthesis.







Abstract
In recent years, mechanochemistry has enriched the toolbox of synthetic chemists, enabling faster and more sustainable access to new materials and existing products, including active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). However, molecular&#8208;level understanding of most mechanochemical reactions remains limited, delaying the implementation of mechanochemistry in industrial applications. Herein, we have applied in&#8197;situ monitoring by Raman spectroscopy to the mechanosynthesis of phenytoin, a World Health Organization (WHO) Essential Medicine, enabling the observation, isolation, and characterization of key molecular&#8208;migration intermediates involved in the single&#8208;step transformation of benzil, urea, and KOH into phenytoin. This work contributes to the elucidation of a reaction mechanism that has been subjected to a number of interpretations over time and paints a clear picture of how mechanosynthesis can be applied and optimized for the preparation of added&#8208;value molecules.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring new catalytic strategies for achieving efficient CO  2  hydrogenation under mild conditions is of great significance for environmental remediation. Herein, a composite photocatalyst Zr&#8208;based MOF encapsulated plasmonic AuPt alloy nanoparticles (AuPt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  ) was successfully constructed for the efficient photothermal catalysis of CO  2  hydrogenation.

The outstanding performances of AuPt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  were attributed to the synergetic effect originating from the plasmonic metal Au NPs, doped active metal Pt, and encapsulation structure of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  shell.

         <dc:description>
The triptycene scaffold has been ring&#8208;opened in a retro&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;type reaction under acidic conditions to give its corresponding anthrone product. 9&#8208;Hydroxytriptycenes and unsubstituted triptycene undergo ring&#8208;opening reaction under strongly acidic conditions, such as with TfOH. An investigation of the substitution effect has revealed that the electron&#8208;donating group on the arene moiety allows the reaction to proceed in the presence of a weaker acid, such as TFA. In addition, the reaction has been successfully applied toward the synthesis of tetracene.

         <title>Unlocking the Hydrolytic Mechanism of GH92 &#945;&#8208;1,2&#8208;Mannosidases: Computation Inspires the use of C&#8208;Glycosides as Michaelis Complex Mimics</title>

         <dc:description>
Glycoside hydrolase 92 enzymes catalyze the degradation of N&#8208;glycans containing chains of &#945;&#8208;mannose. Since experiments with S&#8208;glycosides did not shed light about the conformation of the Michaelis complex (MC), we present a multidisciplinary work where computation and experiments demonstrate the reactive conformation adopted by the sugar in the MC. In addition, we demonstrate the power of C&#8208;glycosides as MC mimics.







Abstract
The conformational changes in a sugar moiety along the hydrolytic pathway are key to understand the mechanism of glycoside hydrolases (GHs) and to design new inhibitors. The two predominant itineraries for mannosidases go via OS2&#8594;B2,5&#8594;1S5 and 3S1&#8594;3H4&#8594;1C4. For the CAZy family 92, the conformational itinerary was unknown. Published complexes of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron GH92 catalyst with a S&#8208;glycoside and mannoimidazole indicate a 4C1&#8594;4H5/1S5&#8594;1S5 mechanism. However, as observed with the GH125 family, S&#8208;glycosides may not act always as good mimics of GH's natural substrate. Here we present a cooperative study between computations and experiments where our results predict the E5&#8594;B2,5/1S5&#8594;1S5 pathway for GH92 enzymes. Furthermore, we demonstrate the Michaelis complex mimicry of a new kind of C&#8208;disaccharides, whose biochemical applicability was still a chimera.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Degradable Protein&#8208;Polymer Hybrid Shells for Caging Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy towards the remote control of cell functions is reported. Photo&#8208;degradable protein&#8208;polymer hybrid shells for protecting the whole cell surface were developed by the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly of polymers and polymer micelles through protein&#8208;ligand binding. These shells can be used to photo&#8208;regulate cellular functions by steric hinderance against the interaction between cell surfaces and substrates.







Abstract
There is growing demand for the precise remote control of cellular functions in various fields. Herein, a method for caging mammalian cells by coating with photodegradable protein&#8208;polymer hybrid shells to photo&#8208;control their functions without genetic engineering is reported. A layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly of photocleavable synthetic materials through biotin&#8208;streptavidin (SA) binding was employed for cell coating. The cell surfaces were first biotinylated with photocleavable biotinylated poly(ethylene glycol)(PEG)&#8208;lipid and then coated by repeatedly layering SA and micelles of the PEG&#8208;lipid and photocleavable biotinylated four&#8208;arm PEG. The cell extension and adhesion were suppressed with the shells and then triggered with the degradation of the shells by light exposure. Macrophage phagocytosis was also stopped by caging with the shells and restarted by light&#8208;guided uncaging. This study provides the first proof of principle that cellular functions can be remotely controlled by steric hinderance of cell surfaces with photodegradable materials.

         <title>Remote Oxidative Activation of a [Cp*Rh] Monohydride**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox chemistry: [Cp*Rh] complexes supported by chelating diphosphine ligands can support generation of isolable metal monohydrides, but prior work has shown that the reduction potentials required to promote cleavage of Rh&#8722;H moieties in these complexes are quite negative. Herein, ligand&#8208;centered oxidation of a [Cp*Rh] monohydride is demonstrated to result in dramatic acidification of a Rh&#8722;H by 23 pKa units. Ligand&#8208;promoted redox chemistry could thus be a useful tool for promoting reactivity in metal&#8211;hydride systems.







Abstract
Half&#8208;sandwich rhodium monohydrides are often proposed as intermediates in catalysis, but little is known regarding the redox&#8208;induced reactivity accessible to these species. Herein, the bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene (dppf) ligand has been used to explore the reactivity that can be induced when a [Cp*Rh] monohydride undergoes remote (dppf&#8208;centered) oxidation by 1e&#8722;. Chemical and electrochemical studies show that one&#8208;electron redox chemistry is accessible to Cp*Rh(dppf), including a unique quasi&#8208;reversible RhII/I process at &#8722;0.96&#8197;V vs. ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fc+/0). This redox manifold was confirmed by isolation of an uncommon RhII species, [Cp*Rh(dppf)]+, that was characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Protonation of Cp*Rh(dppf) with anilinium triflate yielded an isolable and inert monohydride, [Cp*Rh(dppf)H]+, and this species was found to undergo a quasireversible electrochemical oxidation at +0.41&#8197;V vs. Fc+/0 that corresponds to iron&#8208;centered oxidation in the dppf backbone. Thermochemical analysis predicts that this dppf&#8208;centered oxidation drives a dramatic increase in acidity of the Rh&#8722;H moiety by 23 pKa units, a reactivity pattern confirmed by in situ 1H NMR studies. Taken together, these results show that remote oxidation can effectively induce M&#8722;H activation and suggest that ligand&#8208;centered redox activity could be an attractive feature for the design of new systems relying on hydride intermediates.

Boron&#8208;, sulfur&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emitters are designed and synthesized to combine high photoluminescent quantum efficiency and rapid reverse intersystem crossing in one multiple resonance system for efficient narrow&#8208;band blue emission with full width at half maximum of 29&#8197;nm, which provides an avenue to expand the structure library for PAH skeletons with multiple resonance effect and narrow&#8208;band emission.

         <title>Nonaqueous Emulsion Polycondensation Enabled by a Self&#8208;Assembled Cage&#8208;like Surfactant</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cationic self&#8208;assembled coordination cage was decorated with cholesterol groups attached via ethoxy chains, giving it a pronounced amphiphilic character. The nanosized cage acts as a surfactant for a variety of nonaqueous emulsions. These were employed in mini&#8208;emulsion polymerization reactions to produce polyurethane and polyurea materials with different particle sizes and morphologies.







Abstract
Nonaqueous emulsions are crucial for a range of applications based on water&#8208;sensitive systems such as controlled polymerizations requiring anhydrous reaction conditions and the stabilization of readily hydrolyzable reagents or pharmacologically active components. However, defined molecular surfactants to stabilize such nonaqueous emulsions are scarce. We introduce a self&#8208;assembled coordination cage, decorated with cholesterol functionalities, to serve as a molecular surfactant for various oil&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsions of immiscible organic solvents. While the positively charged cage forms the amphiphile's polar moiety, the non&#8208;polar cholesterol appendices can bend in a common direction to stabilize the emulsion. Templated by the droplets, polycondensation reactions were carried out to produce microstructured polyurethane and polyurea materials of different particle sizes and morphologies. Further, the amphiphilic cage can encapsulate a guest molecule and the resulting host&#8208;guest assembly was also examined as a surfactant. In addition, the aggregation behavior of the amphiphilic cage in an aqueous medium was examined.

         <title>A Semiconductor&#8208;Mediator&#8208;Catalyst Artificial Photosynthetic System for Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid semiconductor&#8208;mediator&#8208;catalyst photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell mimicking the PSII is proposed for efficient water oxidation. Addition of carbazole mediator results in a significant enhancement in PEC water oxidation performance as it promotes interfacial hole transfer from the Fe2O3 light absorber to the Ru(carbene) catalyst, a function similar to the tyrosine residue in photosystem II. Such a semiconductor&#8208;mediator&#8208;catalyst assembly greatly inspires the rational design of high&#8208;performance artificial photosynthesis systems.







Abstract
In fabricating an artificial photosynthesis (AP) electrode for water oxidation, we have devised a semiconductor&#8208;mediator&#8208;catalyst structure that mimics photosystem II (PSII). It is based on a surface layer of vertically grown nanorods of Fe2O3 on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) electrodes with a carbazole mediator base and a Ru(II) carbene complex on a nanolayer of TiO2 as a water oxidation co&#8208;catalyst. The resulting hybrid assembly, FTO|Fe2O3|&#8722;carbazole|TiO2|&#8722;Ru(carbene), demonstrates an enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation performance compared to an electrode without the added carbaozle base with an increase in photocurrent density of 2.2&#8208;fold at 0.95&#8197;V vs. NHE and a negatively shifted onset potential of 500&#8197;mV. The enhanced PEC performance is attributable to carbazole mediator accelerated interfacial hole transfer from Fe2O3 to the Ru(II) carbene co&#8208;catalyst, with an improved effective surface area for the water oxidation reaction and reduced charge transfer resistance.

         <title>Parasitic light absorption, rate laws and heterojunctions in the photocatalytic oxidation of arsenic(III) using composite TiO2/Fe2O3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Composite photocatalyst&#8208;adsorbents such as TiO2/Fe2O3  are promising materials for the one&#8208;step treatment of arsenite contaminated water. However, no previous study has investigated how coupling TiO2  with Fe2O3  influences the photocatalytic oxidation of arsenic(III). Herein, we develop new hybrid experiment/modelling approaches to study light absorption, charge carrier behaviour and changes in the rate law of the TiO2/Fe2O3  system, using UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS), and kinetic analysis.  Whilst coupling TiO2  with Fe2O3  improves total arsenic removal by adsorption, oxidation rates significantly decrease (up to a factor of 60), primarily due to the parasitic absorption of light by Fe2O3  (88% of photons at 368 nm) and secondly due to changes in the rate law from disguised zero&#8208;order kinetics to first&#8208;order kinetics. Charge transfer across this TiO2&#8208;Fe2O3  heterojunction is not observed.  Our study demonstrates the first application of a multi&#8208;adsorbate surface complexation model (SCM)  towards describing As(III) oxidation kinetics which, unlike Langmuir&#8208;Hinshelwood kinetics, includes the competitive adsorption of As(V), and we further highlight the importance of parasitic light absorption and catalyst fouling when designing heterogeneous photocatalysts for As(III) remediation.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermodynamically Favourable States in the Reaction of Nitrogenase without Dissociation of any Sulfide Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction mechanism of nitrogenase from N2H2 to 2&#8201;NH3 without any dissociated sulfide ligands has been studied by QM/MM methods. The calculations suggest an alternating mechanism in which the substrate binds to Fe6. Homocitrate functions as a proton buffer, stabilising H2NNH2 and NH3 intermediates. The two NH3 products dissociate at the E7 and E8 levels. His&#8208;195 prefers protonation on the NE2 atom and proton transfer from this residue is favourable for all steps.







Abstract
We have used combined quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations to study the reaction mechanism of nitrogenase, assuming that none of the sulfide ligands dissociates. To avoid the problem that there is no consensus regarding the structure and protonation of the E4 state, we start from a state where N2 is bound to the cluster and is protonated to N2H2, after dissociation of H2. We show that the reaction follows an alternating mechanism with HNNH (possibly protonated to HNNH2) and H2NNH2 as intermediates and the two NH3 products dissociate at the E7 and E8 levels. For all intermediates, coordination to Fe6 is preferred, but for the E4 and E8 intermediates, binding to Fe2 is competitive. For the E4, E5 and E7 intermediates we find that the substrate may abstract a proton from the hydroxy group of the homocitrate ligand of the FeMo cluster, thereby forming HNNH2, H2NNH2 and NH3 intermediates. This may explain why homocitrate is a mandatory component of nitrogenase. All steps in the suggested reaction mechanism are thermodynamically favourable compared to protonation of the nearby His&#8208;195 group and in all cases, protonation of the NE2 atom of the latter group is preferred.

         <title>Characterizing Enzyme Cooperativity with Imaging SAMDI&#8208;MS</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;throughput and label&#8208;free method is established for to characterize the degree of cooperativity and K0.5 of a cooperative metal&#8208;enzyme binding interaction using microfluidics and imaging self&#8208;assembled monolayers for matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (iSAMDI). Numerical calculations were used to build a finite element model to describe the spatiotemporal pattern of reaction yields for each channel within the microfluidic device.







Abstract
This paper describes a method that combines a microfluidic device and self&#8208;assembled monolayers for matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (SAMDI) mass spectrometry to calculate the cooperativity in binding of calcium ions to peptidylarginine deiminase type 2 (PAD2). This example uses only 120&#8197;&#956;L of enzyme solution and three fluidic inputs. This microfluidic device incorporates a self&#8208;assembled monolayer that is functionalized with a peptide substrate for PAD2. The enzyme and different concentrations of calcium ions are flowed through each of eight channels, where the position along the channel corresponds to reaction time and position across the channel corresponds to the concentration of Ca2+. Imaging SAMDI (iSAMDI) is then used to determine the yield for the enzyme reaction at each 200&#8197;&#956;m pixel on the monolayer, providing a time course for the reactions. Analysis of the peptide conversion as a function of position and time gives the degree of cooperativity (n) and the concentration of ligand required for half maximal activity (K0.5) for the Ca2+ &#8211; dependent activation of PAD2. This work establishes a high&#8208;throughput and label&#8208;free method for studying enzyme&#8208;ligand binding interactions and widens the applicability of microfluidics and matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI) imaging mass spectrometry.

         <title>Redox Replacement of Silver on MOF&#8208;Derived Cu/C Nanoparticles on Gas Diffusion Electrodes for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From CO2 to C2+: A novel Cu/C&#8722;Ag nanostructured catalyst has been synthesized by electroless redox replacement directly on gas&#8208;diffusion electrodes. An optimum Cu/Ag composition with similar&#8208;sized nanoparticles showed the highest conversion of CO2 to C2+ products compared to only Cu&#8208;modified gas diffusion electrodes. In&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy and gas chromatography measurements suggest two parallel CO2 reduction mechanisms to produce HCO2H and C2+ products on the bimetallic Cu/Ag surface.







Abstract
Bimetallic tandem catalysts have emerged as a promising strategy to locally increase the CO flux during electrochemical CO2 reduction, so as to maximize the rate of conversion to C&#8722;C&#8208;coupled products. Considering this, a novel Cu/C&#8722;Ag nanostructured catalyst has been prepared by a redox replacement process, in which the ratio of the two metals can be tuned by the replacement time. An optimum Cu/Ag composition with similarly sized particles showed the highest CO2 conversion to C2+ products compared to non&#8208;Ag&#8208;modified gas&#8208;diffusion electrodes. Gas chromatography and in&#8208;situ Raman measurements in a CO2 gas diffusion cell suggest the formation of top&#8208;bound linear adsorbed *CO followed by consumption of CO in the successive cascade steps, as evidenced by the increasing&#957;C&#8722;H bands. These findings suggest that two mechanisms operate simultaneously towards the production of HCO2H and C&#8722;C&#8208;coupled products on the Cu/Ag bimetallic surface.

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of meta&#8208;Bromo&#8208; and meta&#8208;Trifluoromethylanilines from Cyclopentanones by a Cascade Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fully regioselective synthesis of meta&#8208;bromo&#8208; and meta&#8208;trifluoromethylanilines through a cascade reaction from bench&#8208;stable non&#8208;aromatic precursors is reported. The convenient reaction setup requires only heating of the desired amine and the bench&#8208;stable reagents in sulfolane. The method is compatible with a broad range of primary, secondary and aromatic amines and proceeds in 20&#8211;81&#8201;% yields.







Abstract
Anilines are key constituents in biologically active compounds and often obtained from transition metal&#8208;catalyzed coupling of an aryl halide with an amine. In this work, we report a transition metal&#8208;free method for the synthesis of meta&#8208;bromo&#8208; and meta&#8208;trifluoromethylanilines starting from 3&#8208;tribromomethylcyclopentanone or 3&#8208;(2&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;chloro&#8208;1,1,1&#8208;trifluoroethyl)cyclopentanone, respectively. The scope of the transformation is shown by application of primary, secondary and aromatic amines. The reaction proceeds in acceptable to high yields (20&#8211;81&#8201;%), and allows for the synthesis of anilines with substitution patterns otherwise difficult to access.

         <title>Four Dibenzofuran&#8208;Terminated High&#8208;Triplet&#8208;Energy Hole Transporters for High&#8208;Efficiency and Long&#8208;Life Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Devices</title>

         <dc:description>
Four dibenzofuran&#8208;terminated hole&#8208;transporters exhibit superior thermal and electrical stability, thus realizing highly efficient and long lifetime thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) and phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs). A TADF OLED achieves an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 23&#8201;% and operation lifetime (LT50) of over 20&#8201;000&#8197;h at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. Moreover, a phosphorescent OLED achieves an EQE of 21&#8201;% and LT50 of over 30&#8201;000&#8197;h at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.







Abstract
The weak stability of a hole&#8208;transporter upon approaching the anion state is one of the major bottlenecks for developing long&#8208;life organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs). Therefore, in this study, we developed a series of thermally and electrically stable hole&#8208;transporters that are end&#8208;capped with four dibenzofuran units. These materials exhibit i)&#8197;high bond dissociation energy (BDE) toward the anion state, ii)&#8197;a high glass transition temperature (Tg&gt;130&#8201;&#176;C), and iii)&#8197;high triplet energy (ET&gt;2.7&#8197;eV), thereby enabling approximately 20&#8201;% high external quantum efficiency (EQE) and significantly prolonging the stability of both thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) and phosphorescent OLEDs with an operation lifetime at 50&#8201;% (LT50) of 20&#8201;000&#8211;30&#8201;000&#8197;h at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. In addition, investigating their structure&#8208;property relationship revealed that ionization potential (IP), BDE, and Tg are critical prerequisites for the hole&#8208;transporter to prolong lifetime in OLEDs.

         <title>Benchmarking of density functionals for the description of optical properties of newly synthesized &#960;&#8208;conjugated TADF blue emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Computational modeling of the optical characteristics of organic molecules with potential for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) may assist markedly the development of more efficient emitting materials for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. Recent theoretical studies in this area employ mostly methods from density functional theory (DFT). In order to obtain accurate predictions within this approach, the choice of a proper functional is crucial. In the current study, we focus on testing the performance of a set of DFT functionals for estimation of the excitation and emission energy and the excited singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap of three newly synthesized compounds with capacity for TADF. The emitters are designed specifically to enable charge transfer via &#960;&#8208;electron conjugation, at the same time possessing high&#8208;energy excited triplet states. The functionals chosen for testing are from various groups ranging from gradient&#8208;corrected through global hybrids to range&#8208;separated ones. The results show that the monitored optical properties are especially sensitive to how the long&#8208;range part of the exchange energy is treated within the functional. The accurate functional should also be able to provide well balanced distribution of the &#960;&#8208;electrons among the molecular fragments. Global hybrids with moderate (less than 0.4) share of exact exchange (B3LYP, PBE0) and the meta&#8208;GGA HSE06 are outlined as the best performing methods for the systems under study. They are able to predict all important optical parameters correctly, both qualitatively and quantitatively.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning of the C/N ratio of C&#8208;rich graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) materials by the melamine/carboxylic acid adduct route</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CC&#8208;rich graphitic carbonitride materials (CNx) with a large range of composition have been prepared thanks to the self&#8208;assembly, in different ratios, of melamine (M) and a panel of polycarboxylic acid (A) such as oxalic, tartaric and citric acid. The thermal conversion of the formed adducts (MAy), led to CNx phases with x ranging from 0.66 to 1.4 (x=1.33 for g&#8208;C3N4  for comparison). The properties of these materials were followed by different techniques (XRD, Raman, TEM, TGA, XPS and DRIFT). It appears that the increase of the C content is associated to a disappearance of the long&#8208;range order of heptazine units and to an increase of the subnanometric carbon&#8211;rich cluster size within the graphitic g&#8208;C3N4  structure. This trend is followed by a significant increase of the interlayer spacing and a lower proportion of the N=C&#8208;N bonds compared to C=C bonds. The thermal stability in inert atmosphere of these phases and their UV&#8208;Visible absorbance properties were also investigated.</dc:description>

         <title>Properties of Bromine Fused Salts based on Quaternary Ammonium Molecules and their Relevance for Use in a Hydrogen Bromine Redox Flow Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bromine complexing agents (BCA) in aqueous electrolytes for hydrogen bromine flow batteries are used to reduce bromine's vapor pressure, while an insoluble and liquid fused salt is formed. The properties (concentrations, composition, conductivity and viscosity) of this fused salt are investigated in this study systematically ex situ by using 7 BCAs at different state of charge in HBr/Br  2  /H  2  O electrolytes with a theoretical capacity of 179.6 Ah L  &#8208;1  . Bromine is stored in the fused salt at concentrations up to 13.6 M, reaching theoretical volumetrical capacities up to 730 Ah L  &#8208;1  in fused salts. The fused salt consists of a pure, bromine&#8208; and waterfree ionic liquid of organic [BCA]  +  cations and polybromides, and its conductivity bases on a hopping mechanism among the polybromides. Alkyl side chain length of the BCAs and distribution of polybromides influence strongly the conductivity and viscosity of the fused salts. 1&#8208;ethylpyridin&#8208;1&#8208;iumbromide results to be favoured BCA for application.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Chemical Protein Synthesis Utilizing Fmoc&#8208;Masked Selenazolidine to address the Redox Functionality of Human Selenoprotein F</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Human SELENOF is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) selenoprotein that contains the redox active motif CXU (C is cysteine and U is selenocysteine), resembling the redox motif of thiol&#8208;disulfide oxidoreductases (CXXC). Like other selenoproteins, the challenge in accessing SELENOF has somewhat limited its full biological characterization thus far. Here we present the one&#8208;pot chemical synthesis of the thioredoxin&#8208;like domain of SELENOF, highlighted by the use of Fmoc&#8208;protected selenazolidine, native chemical ligations and deselenization reactions. The redox potential of the CXU motif, together with insulin turbidimetric assay suggested that SELENOF may catalyze the reduction of disulfides in misfolded proteins. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SELENOF is not a protein disulfide isomerase (PDI)&#8208;like enzyme, as it did not enhance the folding of the two protein models; bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor and hirudin. These studies suggest that SELENOF may be responsible for reducing the non&#8208;native disulfide bonds of misfolded glycoproteins as part of the quality control system in the ER.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic antibody&#8208;rhamnose cluster conjugates show potent complement&#8208;dependent cell killing by recruiting natural antibodies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are one of the most rapidly growing drug classes used for the treatment of cancer, infectious and autoimmune diseases. Complement&#8208;dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) is one of the effector functions for antibodies to deplete target cells. We report here an efficient chemoenzymatic synthesis of structurally well&#8208;defined conjugates of a monoclonal antibody with a rhamnose&#8208; and an &#945;Gal trisaccharide&#8208;cluster to recruit natural anti&#8208;rhamnose and anti&#8208;&#945;Gal antibodies, respectively, to enhance the CDC&#8208;dependent targeted cell killing. The synthesis was achieved by using a modular antibody Fc&#8208;glycan remodeling method that includes site&#8208;specific chemoenzymatic Fc&#8208;glycan functionalization and subsequent click conjugation of synthetic rhamnose&#8208; and &#945;Gal trisaccharide&#8208;cluster to provide the respective homogeneous antibody conjugates. Cell&#8208;based assays indicated that the antibody&#8208;rhamnose cluster conjugates could mediate potent CDC activity for targeted cancer cell killing and showed much more potent efficacy than the antibody&#8208;&#945;Gal trisaccharide cluster conjugates for CDC effects.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A spin&#8208;selective tribo&#8208;chemical reaction using a dinuclear lanthanide complex is demonstrated for the first time. The dinuclear complex is composed of two Eu  III  ions, hexafluoroacetylacetonato ligands, and anthracene&#8208;based phosphine oxide bridges. Single crystal analysis revealed a face&#8208;to&#8208;face type anthracene dimer structure in the dinuclear Eu  III  complex. Mechanical stimulus on the dinuclear Eu  III  complex induced selective formation of oxidized anthracene. The tribo&#8208;chemical reaction is based on a characteristic energy transfer pathway for the selective formation of an excited triplet state.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereochemical Behavior of Pairs of P&#8208;stereogenic Phosphanyl Groups at the Dimethylxanthene Backbone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The P&#8208;stereogenic bis(phosphanes) 7 and 9, featuring pairs of P(Mes)&#8208;ethynyl or vinyl substituents at the dimethyl xanthene backbone show rather low barriers of stereochemical inversion at phosphorus. &#960;&#8208;conjugative effects are probably causing these low inversion barriers. Compound 7 reacted with B(C6F5)3 to form the nine&#8208;membered heterocyclic product 10, featuring a [P]&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;B(C6F5)3 substituent. Compound 7 was converted to the bis[P(Mes)vinyl] xanthene derivative 9, which gave the zwitterionic P(H)(Mes)&#8208;CH=CH&#8208;B(C6F5)3 containing product 16 upon treatment with B(C6F5)3. Thermally induced epimerization barriers at phosphorus of ca. 20 to 26 kcal mol&#8208;1 were calculated by DFT for the alkenyl&#8208;and alkynyl&#8208;P derived systems 6 to 9, 15 and 16 and experimentally determined for the examples 7 and 16.</dc:description>

         <title>Developing Flexible Quinacridone Derivatives&#8208;Based Photothermal Evaporaters for Solar Steam and Thermoelectric Power Generation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar&#8208;driven interfacial vaporization by localizing solar&#8208;thermal energy conversion to the air&#8208;water interface has attracted tremendous attention. In the process of converting solar energy into heat energy, photothermal materials play an essential role.&#160;Herein, a flexible solar&#8208;thermal material di&#8208;cyan substituted 5,12&#8208;dibutylquinacridone (DCN&#8208;4CQA)@Paper was developed via coating photothermal quinacridone derivatives on the cellulose paper. The DCN&#8208;4CQA@Paper combines&#160;desired chemical and physical properties, broadband light&#8208;absorbing,&#160;and shape&#8208;conforming abilities that render efficient photothermic vaporization. Notably, synergetic coupling of solar&#8208;steam and solar&#8208;electricity technologies via integrating DCN&#8208;4CQA@Paper and the thermoelectric&#160;devices&#160;is realized without trade&#8208;offs, highlighting the practical consideration toward more impactful solar heat exploitation. Such solar distillation and low&#8208;grade heat&#8208;to&#8208;electricity generation functions can provide potential opportunities for fresh water and electricity supply in off&#8208;grid or remote areas.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;light switching of metallosupramolecular assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A photoswitchable ligand and palladium(II) ions form a dynamic mixture of self&#8208;assembled metallosupramolecular structures. The photoswitching ligand is an ortho&#8208;fluoroazobenzene with appended pyridyl groups. Combining the  E  &#8208;isomer with palladium(II) salts affords a double&#8208;walled triangle with composition [Pd  3  L  6  ]  6+  and a distorted tetrahedron [Pd  4  L  8  ]  8+  (1:2 ratio at 298 K). Irradiation with 410&#160;nm light generates a photostationary state with ~80% of the  E&#8208;  isomer of the ligand and results in the selective disassembly of the tetrahedron, the more thermodynamically stable structure, and the formation of the triangle, the more kinetically inert product. The triangle is then slowly transformed back into the tetrahedron over 2 days at 333 K. The  Z  &#8208;isomer of the ligand does not form any well&#8208;defined structures and has a thermal half&#8208;life of 25 days at 298K. This approach shows how a thermodynamically preferred self&#8208;assembled structure can be reversibly pumped to a kinetic trap by small perturbations of the isomer distribution using non&#8208;destructive visible light.</dc:description>
