         <title>A Blue Light and Two&#8208;Photon Activatable Rhodamine Fluorophore</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoactivatable fluorophores (PAFs) are powerful tools for biological imaging applications because they provide spatiotemporal control of fluorescence distribution. Many of the existing PAFs can only be activated by UV irradiation. In our study, we present a blue light (1P) and NIR light (2P) activatable rhodamine fluorophore. Next to the description of the synthesis and the investigation of the photoreaction, we demonstrate the use of our PAF in the context of laser scanning microscopy. By immobilization of our PAF in a hydrogel, we were able to write and read spatially resolved illumination patterns with excellent contrast after both one&#8208;photon and two&#8208;photon excitation.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Protonation as a Switch of the Twisted Excited States with &#960;&#960;* or n&#960;* Character and Correlation with the &#960;&#8208;electrons Characteristic of Rotatable Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;protonation for numerous fluorophores is widely known as an efficient switch for the fluorescence turn&#8208;on/off in acidic conditions, which has been applied in various scenarios that involve pH monitoring. Yet the universal mechanism for fluorescence regulation through N&#8208;protonation is still elusive. Herein, we systematically investigated the excited state deactivation processes for a series of nitrogen&#8208;containing fluorescent probes through theoretical approaches. We concluded two types of mechanisms for the complex fluorescent phenomena by N&#8208;protonation: one is through the regulation for the transition to a &#960;&#960;* twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) state; the other one applies for the case when nonradiative decay pathway is predominant by a dark n&#960;* state, which is also accompanied by an evident structural twisting and can be regarded as another kind of TICT state. More generally, we found that the formation of the TICT state is closely related to the conjugated &#960;&#8208;electrons on the single bond that links the acceptor and donor part of fluorophores, which provides a simple strategy for evaluating the occurrence of the TICT process. We anticipate that the current contributions can bring novel insights for the rational design of functional fluorophores that involve TICT process in the excited states.</dc:description>

         <title>Caffeine Biodegradation by Cytochrome P450 1A2. What Determines the Product Distributions?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations on large P450 enzyme models reproduce experimental product distributions excellently and highlight the second coordination sphere interactions in the protein.







Abstract
Caffeine is a natural compound found in plant seeds that after consumption by humans effects the central nervous system as well as the cardiovascular system. In general, the cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver are involved in the biodegradation of caffeine, which gives paraxanthine, theobromine and theophylline products. There has been debate for many years why multiple products are obtained and how their distributions are determined. To this end we performed a high&#8208;level computational study using a combination of molecular dynamics and quantum mechanical approaches. A series of quantum chemical cluster models on the mechanism of caffeine activation by P450 model complexes give hydrogen atom abstraction barriers that predicts the correct ordering and statistical distribution of products. Our studies highlight that second&#8208;coordination sphere effects and thermochemical properties of the substrate determine the product distributions.

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding (ChB) as a Robust Supramolecular Recognition Motif of Benzisothiazolinone Antibacterials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
BenzIsothiazolinones are commonly used antibacterial and antifungal agents. In these heterocycles, the propensity of sulfur to form N&#8722;S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O chalcogen bonds is robust enough to allow for the interaction to act as a general and reliable recognition motif in chemical environments suggesting that this may be the case also in biological environment.







Abstract
1,2&#8208;benzisothiazol&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;one derivatives are highly active against a broad spectrum of fungi as well as Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. For this reason they are extensively used, for example, as additives in detergents, leather products, paper coatings, and antifouling paintings. In this paper experimental findings are reported proving that the sulfur atom of benzisothiazolinones have a remarkable tendency to form short and directional chalcogen bondings on the extension of the covalent N&#8722;S bond and, to a lesser extent, of the C&#8722;S bond. Analyses of the Cambridge Structural Database confirm the interaction as a primary recognition motif of these systems. The electrophilicity of sulfur is crucial in the chemical reactions initiating the cascade of events resulting in the biopharmacological activities of benzisothiazolinones. The reported results suggest that the electrophility of sulfur may play a role also at earlier stages than the reactive ones, namely it may pin the compounds at the active site of target enzymes via chalcogen bondings that preorganize the system in the conformation required for the bonds formation/cleavage determining the biopharmacological activity

         <title>Dynamic Approach to Synthetic Lectin for Glucose with Boosted Binding Affinity through C&#8722;H Hydrogen Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic receptor for glucose has been developed by using dynamic imine chemistry followed by imine&#8208;to&#8208;amide oxidation. The design of the receptor features two parallel durene panels forming a hydrophobic pocket. The incorporation of two pyridinium residues enhances water solubility and improves substrate binding by establishing more hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
A biomimetic receptor for glucose has been developed with high affinity and selectivity. The receptor was efficiently synthesized in three steps through dynamic imine chemistry followed by imine&#8208;to&#8208;amide oxidation. The receptor features two parallel durene panels, forming a hydrophobic pocket for [CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;] interactions, and two pyridinium residues directing four amide bonds towards the pocket. These pyridinium residues not only improve solubility but also provide polarized C&#8722;H bonds for hydrogen bonding. Experimental data and DFT calculations show that these polarized C&#8722;H bonds significantly enhance substrate binding. These findings demonstrate the power of dynamic covalent chemistry for creating molecular receptors and using polarized C&#8722;H bonds for boosted carbohydrate recognition in water, providing a foundation for developing glucose&#8208;responsive materials and sensors.

         <title>Intermetallic Compound TiM (M=Co, Fe) with a Layered Structure Prepared by Deoxidizing Ilmenite&#8208;type Oxides in Molten LiCl&#8208;CaH2 Mixtures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ilmenite&#8208;type oxides MTiO3 (M=Co, Fe) with layered structures perpendicular to the c axis of the trigonal structure were mildly deoxidized by CaH2 in molten LiCl at 600&#8201;&#176;C to obtain intermetallic compounds TiM with layered structures after the deoxidation time of 15&#8211;120&#8197;min. During 1&#8211;5&#8197;min, Li2TiO3&#8208;like compounds were observed as an intermediate to maintain the MTiO3&#8208;originated layered structure.







Abstract
CsCl&#8208;type intermetallic compounds TiM (M=Co, Fe) were obtained by deoxidizing trigonal ilmenite&#8208;type MTiO3 with a reducing agent CaH2 in molten LiCl at 600&#8201;&#176;C. X&#8208;ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy with energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray, and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses revealed the formation of nanoscale layered structures, which enhanced specific surface areas (approximately 20&#8197;m2/g) in the intermetallic compounds. In the initial deoxidation stage, Li2TiO3&#8208;like compounds were observed as an intermediate, suggesting the substitution of M in MTiO3 by Li from the molten LiCl. Compound MTiO3 has a layered structure perpendicular to the c axis of the trigonal structure, suggesting that the layered structures may originate from the crystal structure of the precursors. Formation of the Li2TiO3&#8208;like intermediate may help maintain the original layered structure during deoxidation and the subsequent alloying at temperatures as low as 600&#8201;&#176;C.

Putting the contortion back into the truxene fragments. Substitution of the methylene fragments by strongly electron accepting phosphaalkene or arsaalkenes provides new tuning opportunities for twisted PAHs.







Abstract
We report the functionalization and deplanarization of truxenes using pnictaalkene fragments. Selective introduction of one, two, or three Mes*&#8208;Pn fragments provides up to three fully reversible reductions based on the Pn=C fragments. The incorporation of the unsaturated heteroelement fragment as well as the contortion of the truxene core result in significantly red&#8208;shifted absorption spectra and interesting opto&#8208;electronic properties which are studied by electrochemistry and spectro&#8208;electrochemistry. Incorporation of arsaalkene (As=C) motifs gives significantly milder reduction potentials and red&#8208;shifted absorption, while phosphaalkene decorated truxene P3 can be functionalized using Au(I)Cl coordination. Furthermore, solubility is markedly increased upon incorporation of the Pn&#8208;Mes* fragments which renders these materials suitable for solution processing.

         <title>Porous Metal&#8208;Organic Cages Based on Rigid Bicyclo[2.2.2]oct&#8208;7&#8208;ene Type Ligands: Synthesis, Structure, and Gas Uptake Properties</title>

         <dc:description>
Ligands derived from bicyclo[2.2.2]oct&#8208;7&#8208;ene&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetracarboxydiimide units are found to provide a suitably rigid backbone for the synthesis of porous metal&#8208;organic cages. Crystallographic studies show that the cages display a degree of flexibility in the solid state, while the activation protocols followed are a determining factor in the gas uptake capacity of the cages.







Abstract
Three new ligands containing a bicyclo[2.2.2]oct&#8208;7&#8208;ene&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetracarboxydiimide unit have been used to assemble lantern&#8208;type metal&#8208;organic cages with the general formula [Cu4L4]. Functionalisation of the backbone of the ligands leads to distinct crystal packing motifs between the three cages, as observed with single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The three cages vary in their gas sorption behaviour, and the capacity of the materials for CO2 is found to depend on the activation conditions: softer activation conditions lead to superior uptake, and one of the cages displays the highest BET surface area found for lantern&#8208;type cages so far.

         <title>Helical Anatase Titanium Nanotubes through a Protected Crystallization Strategy for Enhanced Photocatalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Helical structure in catalysts has attached attention and been recently investigated for various catalytic reactions. However, helical transition metal oxides suffer from uncontrollable crystallization processes at high temperatures when being transformed from an amorphous phase into the crystalline structure. Herein, we report a helical anatase TiO2 nanotube for the first time, which has been prepared using a protected crystallization strategy in the confined space of silica. &#160;A single chirality of helical TiO2 has been used to track the ordering of the twisted structure. The twisted structure in helical anatase TiO2 nanotube is maintained after a vigorous crystallization process. Helical anatase TiO2 nanotube possesses more accessible active sites and abundant defects of oxygen vacancy and Ti3+ species owing to the twisted structure.&#160;The obtained helical anatase TiO2 nanotube exhibits superior photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production without adding any co&#8208;catalysts. This work provides new insights into the role of helical structure in transition metal&#8208;based catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Superoxide Dismutase&#8208;like Activity of Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework Nanoparticles Comprising Biomimetic Imidazolato&#8208;bridged CuZn Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoparticles exhibiting enzymatic functions have garnered considerable attention due to their structural robustness and the profusion of active sites that can be introduced to a single nanosized particle. Here we report that nanosized mix&#8208;metal zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) show a superoxide dismutase (SOD)&#8208;like catalytic activity. We chose a ZIF composed of copper and zinc ions and 2&#8208;methylimidazole, CuZn&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8, in which the Cu and Zn ions are bridged by an imidazolato ligand. This coordination geometry closely mimics the active site of CuZn superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD). The CuZn&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticles exhibit potent SOD&#8208;like activity, attributed to their porous nature and numerous copper active sites, and also possess exceptional recyclability.</dc:description>

         <title>New Hypothesis Insight of Structural Properties on Four Tau Peptide Fragments in Alzheimer's Disease: Origin from the Histidine Behaviors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>During protein folding and misfolding, structural properties and aggregation tendency can be significantly influenced by histidine behaviors (tautomeric behaviors and protonation behaviors). The original reasons were derived from the net charge changes and the various N/N&#8208;H orientation on imidazole rings. In the current study, total 18 independent REMD simulations were performed to investigate the histidine behaviors on four Tau peptide fragments (MBD, including R1, R2, R3, and R4 fragments). We found that, compared to R1, R2, R3 except (&#949;&#948;), and R4 systems with flexible structural features, only R3(&#949;&#948;) has dominating conformational structure (possibility of 81.3%) with three &#946;&#8208;strand structures in parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet structures at I4&#8208;K6&#160;and I24&#8208;H26, as well as antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet structure at G19&#8208;L21. Importantly, the H25 and H26 residues (in R3(&#949;&#948;) system) are directly involved in the sheet structure formations and strong H&#8208;bonded interactions (possibility range of 31.3%&#8208;44.7%). Furthermore, the donors and acceptors analysis confirmed that only R3(&#949;&#948;) shows faraway amino acids interaction features in both H25 and H26 residues, and such cooperation effects of two histidine residues contribute to current structural features. The current study will be helpful to further enrichment of the histidine behavior hypothesis, it provides new insight for understanding protein folding and misfolding.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Liesegang patterns that develop&#160;as a result of reaction&#8208;diffusion can simultaneously form products with slightly different sizes spatially separated in a single medium. We show here a reaction&#8208;diffusion method using a dormant reagent (citrate) for developing Liesegang patterns of cobalt hexacyanoferrate Prussian Blue analog (PBA) particle libraries. This method slows the precipitation reaction and produces different&#8208;sized particles in a gel medium at different locations. The gel&#8208;embedded particles are still catalytically active. The applicability of the new method to other PBAs and 2D systems is presented. The method proves promising for obtaining similar inorganic framework libraries with catalytic abilities.</dc:description>

         <title>Wettability&#8208;Regulated Synthesis of Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Array with Subnanochannels Enables Efficient Separation of Mono&#8208;/Multi&#8208;valent Metal Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficient separation of mono&#8208;/multi&#8208;valent metal ions is essential in various fields but is still a great challenge. In this work, we present a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) array with subnanochannels for sieving of mono&#8208;/multi&#8208;valent metal ion with high selectivity and ion permeability. The MOF (i.e., HKUST&#8208;1) array inside the micrometer through&#8208;pores of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) membrane was synthesized by confined interfacial reaction at room temperature, through which the location of the oil/water interface was adjusted by regulating the surface wettability of the PET membrane. By taking advantage of size sieving effect of the subnanochannels of HKUST&#8208;1 crystals, mono&#8208;valent metal ions can be effectively separated from multi&#8208;valent metal ions with selectivity up to 3930 (e.g., Li+/Zr4+). The fluxes of Li+ ions can be up to 1.97 mol h&#8208;1 m&#8208;2. The MOF array&#8208;based membrane with subnanochannels developed in this work has promising applications in wastewater treatment, lithium extraction from salt&#8208;lake brines, and other related aspects.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Fluorescent Carbon Dots (CDs) for the Selective detection of Metal&#8208;Containing Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon dots are widely applied for fluorescent&#8208;based sensors. The interplay between dynamic and static quenching is essential to design specific sensors.







Abstract
The pollution caused by heavy metals (HMs) may occur through both natural processes and anthropogenic activities and is found in complex media. The purpose of this review is to summarize the state&#8208;of&#8208;art of fluorescent CDs and the sensing applications in a systematic manner. This review intends to provide clues on the origin on the observed selectivity in chemiluminiscence sensors, which was until now a stated but unaddressed question, and still remains open for debate. Indeed, it is tempting to think that CDs possessing functional groups with soft bases at the surface are able to detect soft metal acids, while the opposite is to be suspected for hard acid&#8208;base pairs. However, the literature shows several examples where this trend does not hold. We found that such observation is explained by the involvement of dynamic quenching, which does not involve the formation of a non&#8208;fluorescent complex, as in the case of static quenching. We have provided an interpretation of published data that was not provided by the original authors and offer guidelines to enable the design of CDs to target ions in solution.

         <title>Radiation&#8208;Responsive Benzothiazolines as Potential Cleavable Fluorogenic Linkers for Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzothiazolines in aqueous solutions are cleaved under irradiation with &#947;&#8208;rays in a dose&#8208;dependent manner, leading to the formation of fluorescent products. The study paves the way for the future use of benzothiazolines as radiation sensors or as prodrugs in the context of radiotherapy.







Abstract
Radiosensitive compounds can be useful for the detection of radiations and also as prodrugs that can be activated during a radiotherapy. Herein we describe the use of benzothiazolines, which upon treatment with 137Cs produced &#947;&#8208;irradiation in water give rise to fluorescent benzothiazoles and concomitant release of amines or carboxylic acids. In a proof of concept study, we showed that benzothiazolines may be used as new cleavable linkers that can be triggered upon irradiation.

         <title>Ruthenium Complexes of Polyfluorocarbon Substituted Terpyridine and Mesoionic Carbene Ligands: An Interplay in CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ruthenium(II) complexes of PFC substituted terpyridines and MIC ligands are presented as molecular electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction. The MIC ligand is used to tune the kinetics of CO2 electrocatalysis and the terpyridine ligands are used for controlling the overpotential.







Abstract
In recent years terpyridines (tpy) and mesoionic carbenes (MIC) have been widely used in metal complexes. With the right combination with a metal center, both of these ligands are individually known to generate excellent catalysts for CO2 reduction. In this study, we combine the potentials of PFC (PFC=polyfluorocarbon) substituted tpy and MIC ligands within the same platform to obtain a new class of complexes, which we investigated with respect to their structural, electrochemical and UV/Vis/NIR spectroelectrochemical properties. We further show that the resulting metal complexes are potent electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction in which CO is exclusively formed with a faradaic efficiency of 92&#8201;%.

&lt;p&gt;Ruthenium(II) complexes of PFC substituted terpyridines and MIC ligands are presented as molecular electrocatalysts for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. The MIC ligand is used to tune the kinetics of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrocatalysis and the terpyridine ligands are used for controlling the overpotential.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years terpyridines (tpy) and mesoionic carbenes (MIC) have been widely used in metal complexes. With the right combination with a metal center, both of these ligands are individually known to generate excellent catalysts for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. In this study, we combine the potentials of PFC (PFC=polyfluorocarbon) substituted tpy and MIC ligands within the same platform to obtain a new class of complexes, which we investigated with respect to their structural, electrochemical and UV/Vis/NIR spectroelectrochemical properties. We further show that the resulting metal complexes are potent electrocatalysts for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction in which CO is exclusively formed with a faradaic efficiency of 92&#8201;%. A preliminary mechanistic study, including the isolation and characterization of a key intermediate is also reported.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Peracid Oxidation of Unactivated sp3 C&#8722;H Bonds: An Important Solvent Effect</title>

The solvent effect: The peracid oxidation of unactivated alkanes in fluorinated alcohol solvents leads to the corresponding alcohol in high yield and with excellent levels of selectivity.







Abstract
The peracid oxidation of hydrocarbons in chlorinated solvents is a low yielding and poorly selective process. Through a combination of DFT calculations, spectroscopic studies, and kinetic measurement it is shown that the origin of this is electronic in nature and can be influenced through the addition of hydrogen bond donors (HBD) and hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA). Performing the reaction of a cycloalkane with mCPBA in a fluorinated alcohol solvent such as nonafluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butanol (NFTB) or hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), which act as strong HBD and poor HBA, leads to significantly higher yields and selectivities being observed for the alcohol product. Application of the optimised reaction conditions allows for the selective oxidation of both cyclic and linear alkane substrates delivering the corresponding alcohol in up to 86&#8201;% yield. The transformation shows selectivity for tertiary centres over secondary centres and the oxidation of secondary centres is strongly influenced by stereoelectronic effects. Primary centres are not oxidised by this method. A simple computational model developed to understand this transformation provides a powerful tool to reliably predict the influence of substitution and functionality on reaction outcome.

         <title>Graphene Oxide&#8208;BODIPY Conjugates as Highly Fluorescent Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shine bright: Graphene oxide chemically functionalized with BODIPY via a dynamic covalent bond evidences an equilibrium between GO&#8208;PBA&#8208;BODIPY and free PBA&#8208;BODIPY. While for GO&#8208;PBA&#8208;BODIPY an ultrafast energy transfer from BODIPY toward GO occurs, free BODIPY simply emits light.







Abstract
Covalent functionalization of graphene oxide (GO) with boron dipyrromethenes (BODIPYs) was achieved through a facile synthesis, affording two different GO&#8208;BODIPY conjugates where the main difference lies in the nature of the spacer and the type of bonds between the two components. The use of a long but flexible spacer afforded strong electronic GO&#8208;BODIPY interactions in the ground state. This drastically altered the light absorption of the BODIPY structure and impeded its selective excitation. In contrast, the utilisation of a short, but rigid spacer based on boronic esters resulted in a perpendicular geometry of the phenyl boronic acid BODIPY (PBA&#8208;BODIPY) with respect to the GO plane, which enables only minor electronic GO&#8208;BODIPY interactions in the ground state. In this case, selective excitation of PBA&#8208;BODIPY was easily achieved, allowing to investigate the excited state interactions. A quantitative ultrafast energy transfer from PBA&#8208;BODIPY to GO was observed. Furthermore, due to the reversible dynamic nature of the covalent GO&#8208;PBA&#8208;BODIPY linkage, some PBA&#8208;BODIPY is free in solution and, hence, not quenched from GO. This resulted in a weak, but detectable fluorescence from the PBA&#8208;BODIPY that will allow to exploit GO&#8208;PBA&#8208;BODIPY for slow release and imaging purposes.

         <title>Transformation of the cyclo&#8208;P5 Middle Deck in [(Cp*Fe)(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)(&#956;,&#951;5:&#951;4&#8208;P5)] upon Functionalization &#8211; A Comprehensive Study of Reactivity</title>

         <dc:description>
Various transformations of the initial cyclo&#8208;P5 ligand in the triple&#8208;decker complex [(Cp*Fe)(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)(&#956;,&#951;5&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;4&#8208;P5)] show that the reaction with main group nucleophiles yields different products depending on the steric demand of the nucleophile used. Subsequent oxidation/electrophilic quenching provides a plethora of P5R2 and P6R3 organophosphorus ligand complexes in unique 1,3 or 1,4 substitution pattern as opposed to the parent complex [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)].







Abstract
The heterobimetallic triple&#8208;decker complex [(Cp*Fe)(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)(&#956;,&#951;5&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;4&#8208;P5)] (1) was functionalized by main group nucleophiles and subsequently electrophilically quenched or oxidized. Reacting 1 with group&#8197;14 nucleophiles revealed different organo&#8208;substituted P5R middle&#8208;decks depending on the steric and electronic effects of the used alkali metal organyls (2: R=tBu; 3: R=Me). Further, with group&#8197;15 nucleophiles, the first structural characterized monosubstituted complexes with phosphanides could be obtained as P5 ligands containing exocyclic {PR2} units (4: R=Cy, H; 5: R=Ph). These monoanionic complexes 2&#8211;5 were isolated and subsequent electrophilic quenching revealed novel types of neutral functionalized polyphosphorus complexes. These complexes bear formal chains of P5R'R&#8217;&#8217; (6: R&#8217;=tBu, R&#8217;=Me) in a 1,3&#8208;disubstitution pattern or P6R'R&#8217;&#8217;R&#8217;&#8217;&#8217; units (7: R&#8217;=Cy, R&#8217;&#8217;=H, R&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;=Me; 8: R&#8217;=Me, R&#8217;&#8217;=Ph, R&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;=Me) in a 1,1,3&#8208;substitution as middle&#8208;decks stabilized by one {Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co} and one {Cp*Fe} fragment. One&#8208;electron oxidation of 2, 3 or 5 by AgBF4 gave access to paramagnetic triple&#8208;decker complexes bearing P5R middle&#8208;decks in various coordination fashions (R=tBu (10), R=PPh2 (12)). Interestingly, for R=Me (11), a dimerization is observed revealing a diamagnetic tetranuclear cluster containing a unique dihydrofulvalene&#8208;type P10R2 ligand. All complexes were characterized by crystallographic and spectroscopic methods (EPR, multinuclear NMR and mass spectrometry) and their electronic structures were elucidated by DFT calculations.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Deoxynitrogenation of Carboxylic Acids with Cyanamides to Access Nitriles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron&#8208;catalyzed deoxynitrogenation strategy to convert carboxylic acids into nitriles is reported. This method utilizes a cyanamide as the recyclable nitrogen donor and deoxygenating reagent and features an easy&#8208;to&#8208;setup without inert gas protection. The synthetic value of this method is highlighted by the broad substrate scope and application in late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceuticals and scaleup reactions and derivatizations.







Abstract
Efficient strategies to access nitriles from common organic functionalities are highly important, given their significance in synthetic and medicinal chemistry. Although the direct transformation of carboxylic acids to nitriles have been explored for decades, there is few general and practical protocol to access nitriles from carboxylic acid precursors. Herein, an iron&#8208;catalyzed deoxynitrogenaton strategy to convert carboxylic acids into nitriles is described. This method utilizes a cyanamide as the recyclable nitrogen donor and deoxygenating reagent, operates broadly across aryl, alkenyl, and alkyl carboxylic acids, and features an easy setup without inert gas protection. The synthetic value of this method is demonstrated by application in late&#8208;stage modification of drug molecules, synthesis of a pharmaceutical structure, and scaleup reactions and downstream derivatizations.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An iron-catalyzed deoxynitrogenation strategy&lt;/b&gt; to convert carboxylic acids into nitriles is reported. This method utilizes a cyanamide as the recyclable nitrogen donor and deoxygenating reagent and features an easy-to-setup without inert gas protection. The synthetic value of this method is highlighted by the broad substrate scope and application in late-stage modification of pharmaceuticals and scaleup reactions and derivatizations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efficient strategies to access nitriles from common organic functionalities are highly important, given their significance in synthetic and medicinal chemistry. Although the direct transformation of carboxylic acids to nitriles have been explored for decades, there is few general and practical protocol to access nitriles from carboxylic acid precursors. Herein, an iron-catalyzed deoxynitrogenaton strategy to convert carboxylic acids into nitriles is described. This method utilizes a cyanamide as the recyclable nitrogen donor and deoxygenating reagent, operates broadly across aryl, alkenyl, and alkyl carboxylic acids, and features an easy setup without inert gas protection. The synthetic value of this method is demonstrated by application in late-stage modification of drug molecules, synthesis of a pharmaceutical structure, and scaleup reactions and downstream derivatizations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pd&#8722;Bi Bimetallic Nanochains for Electroreduction of CO2 to Syngas in Ionic Liquid&#8208;Based Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PdxBi bimetallic nanochains can electrochemically reduce CO2 to syngas with adjustable CO/H2 ratios from 1/7 to 9/1. The outstanding electrocatalytic performance of Pd3Bi bimetallic nanochains could be ascribed to the incorporation of moderate Bi into Pd lattice, which brought about strong adsorption capacity of CO2, abundant active sites, and fast electron transfer rate.







Abstract
The electroreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) is a sustainable method for generating valuable chemicals; however, avoiding unwanted hydrogen (H2) production during the electrolysis is a major challenge. Coproduction of carbon monoxide (CO) and H2 to produce syngas is an effective strategy for solving this problem, and syngas with a desired CO/H2 ratio can be employed to produce methanol or other valuable chemicals. Herein, a series of palladium&#8208;bismuth (Pd&#8722;Bi) bimetallic nanochains with different Pd/Bi atomic ratios were prepared and used in the electroreduction of CO2 to syngas in ionic liquid&#8208;based electrolytes. The ratio of CO/H2 in syngas was regulated in a wide range from 1&#8201;:&#8201;7 to 9&#8201;:&#8201;1 by controlling the applied potentials, Pd/Bi atomic ratios and composition of the electrolytes. In particular, the current density reached 19.3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 on Pd3Bi bimetallic nanochains at an applied potential of &#8722;2.3&#8197;V versus Ag/Ag+ when the CO/H2 ratio was approximately 1&#8201;:&#8201;1. Moreover, the maximum CO Faradaic efficiency was 87.7&#8201;% for these electrocatalysts at an applied potential of &#8722;2.0&#8197;V versus Ag/Ag+. The synergistic effect of Pd and Bi in the ionic liquid&#8208;based electrolyte was the primary reason for the distinct electrocatalytic efficiency of the Pd3Bi bimetallic nanochains. The incorporation of moderate amounts of Bi into the Pd lattice resulted in a stronger CO2 adsorption capacity, more active sites and faster electron transfer rate, which are conducive to improving the electrocatalytic activity.

         <title>Quantitative Electromerism of a Well&#8208;defined Mononuclear Copper Complex Through Reversible Intramolecular Metal&#8208;Ligand Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electromerism in coordination chemistry allows to control the electron distribution and thereby the physical properties and reactivity. Here the first example for quantitative temperature&#8208;dependent electromerism of a mononuclear copper complex is reported, and the factors responsible for this behaviour are analysed.







Abstract
Copper amine oxidases are enzymes that exhibit in their active site a mononuclear copper complex and a 2,4,5&#8208;trihydroxyphenylalanine quinone (TPQ) cofactor; in the oxidative half of the catalytic cycle, the enzymes regulate their activity by a temperature&#8208;dependent electron transfer equilibrium between the CuII complex with the reduced, aminoquinol form of the cofactor and the reactive CuI complex with the corresponding oxidized, semiquinone form of the cofactor. Here, we report the first mononuclear copper complex with redox&#8208;active ligands showing quantitative, reversible electromerism between a CuII eletromer with reduced, neutral ligand and a CuI electromer with an oxidized, radical monocationic ligand. The CuII form, being exclusively present at low temperature, exhibits a lower enthalpy (like the enzymes), but the CuI complex exhibits a higher entropy and is exclusively present at room temperature in CH2Cl2 solution. Further analysis, based on six different copper complexes, discloses a large solvent effect on electromerism.

         <title>Biomimetic Synthesis of Organic Molecular&#8208;Doped Fluorescent Guanine Crystals with Pearlescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent guanine microplatelets exposing the high refractive index (1&#8201;0&#8201;0) face are synthesized by incorporating Nile red (NR) or fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) molecule in guanine crystals in the presence of P(VP&#8208;co&#8208;VA). The synthesized NR&#8208; and FITC&#8208;doped guanine crystals show red and green fluorescence. Aqueous suspensions with NR&#8208; and FITC&#8208;doped guanine crystals exhibit distinct pearlescence.







Abstract
Biomimetic synthesis of guanine crystals has been focused on in the last years. However, multi&#8208;functional guanine crystals occluded with fluorescent molecules have not been realized in the laboratory. Here, the controllable synthesis of guanine crystal microplatelets with fluorescence and pearlescence was achieved for the first time by incorporating Nile red (NR) or fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) molecules into guanine crystals. The synthesized fluorescent guanine crystals are pure &#946;&#8208;phase anhydrous guanine single crystals. Aqueous suspensions with NR&#8208; and FITC&#8208;doped guanine crystals exhibit distinct pearlescence. The fluorescence intensities of NR and FITC were greatly enhanced after being doped into guanine crystals due to the inhibition of aggregation&#8208;caused quenching. Moreover, films composed of fluorescent guanine microplatelets exhibit high diffuse reflection intensity (70&#8201;%). This work provides a strategy to synthesize multifunctional materials composed of organic crystals occluded with dyes.

         <title>Stereochemical Control of Secondary Benzamide&#8208;based BODIPY Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The benzamide group adopts the trans geometry in the fluorescent target compounds, thereby reducing conformational heterogeneity and opening the way to develop sophisticated nanophotonic materials. The main translational motion with these secondary benzamides concerns inversion of the aryl ring, evidenced by NMR spectroscopy and quantified by quantum chemical calculation.







Abstract
Aromatic amides can be used to construct light&#8208;harvesting materials with valuable optical properties. The amide bond is formed using well&#8208;known coupling agents in near quantitative yield, as illustrated here through the synthesis of two boron dipyrromethene derivatives bearing an amide linkage. The primary concern with acyl amides is rotation around the C&#8722;N bond, leading to cis and trans isomers. Using NMR spectroscopy, quantum chemical calculations and critical comparison to simpler benzamides, the stereochemistry of the target compounds has been addressed. The N&#8208;cyclohexyl derivative gave diffraction quality crystals that established a trans geometry for the amide bond. Quantum chemical calculations support the trans geometry as being the lowest&#8208;energy structure in solution but indicate that inversion of the aryl ring is an important structural feature. Indeed, rotation around the C(sp2)&#8722;C(aryl) bond has a strong influence on the solution&#8208;phase NMR spectra. The amide connection has minimal effect on the photophysical properties.

         <title>Exploring Zr&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks as Smart Electrochromic Sensors by Coordination&#8208;Driven Surface Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By coordination&#8208;driven surface engineering, an electrochromic Zr&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework incorporating a viologen&#8208;like electron&#8208;deficient moiety achieved modulated interface electron transfer, thus providing a favorable paradigm for visual analysis such as phosphoprotein detection and aptamer&#8208;directed target recognition.







Abstract
As emerging stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, electrochromic metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are still not utilized in sensing applications due to difficulties in water stability, facile synthesis and functionalization, and efficient translation of specific recognition events. Here, we firstly find that a Zr&#8208;based MOF furnished with postsynthetically created viologen&#8208;like electron&#8208;deficient moiety was electrochromic active. With a coordination&#8208;driven surface engineering strategy where phosphate&#8208;containing biomolecules are tethered to Zr nodes of the MOF, fine tuning the interface electron transfer was readily achieved, thus benefitting for constructing smart electrochromic sensors through the combination of the sensitivity of electrochemistry with the visuality of colorimetry. Particularly, MOF&#8208;coated conductive films enabled label&#8208;free detection of phosphoproteins, and aptamer&#8208;functionalized ones responded specifically to the target. In two cases distinct color changes allow for visual quantification. This study represents the first example of MOF&#8208;based electrochromic sensors developed by an efficient strategy, indicating the generality to electrochromic counterparts for various sensing applications.

         <title>Structural Interconversion Based on Intramolecular Boroxine Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel structural interconversion unit based on intramolecular boroxine formation is developed. A macrocyclic triboronic acid consisting of three phenylboronic acid units linked via covalent linkers preferentially underwent intramolecular boroxine formation rather than intermolecular boroxine formation, resulting in a quantitative formation of tricyclic boroxine. This structural transformation was accompanied with changes in the polarity, flexibility, and size of the molecule. Dynamic interconversion between the macrocyclic triboronic acid and the tricyclic boroxine was achieved via simple heating/cooling, while no boroxine formation occurred upon heating when three boronic acid units were not connected via linkers. Thermodynamic analysis revealed that the entropic advantage of the intramolecular boroxine formation process resulted in these unique features. The entropically stabilized tricyclic boroxine also shows high stability with respect to hydrolysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Racemic Benzenesulfonohydrazide Enantioconvergent Tertiary C(sp3)&#8211;H Amination Catalyzed by Copper and Chiral Phosphoric Acid: Mechanistic Insights and Computational Prediction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Density functional theory computations reveal mechanistic insights into Cu and chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalyzed enantioconvergent amination of racemic benzenesulfonohydrazide. The O&#8211;O bond homolysis of tert&#8208;butyl 4&#8208;phenylbutaneperoxoate was found to be the turnover&#8208;limiting step with a total free energy barrier of 19.1 kcal/mol. The enantioconvergent amination is realized to obtain the same intermediate through prochiral carbon atom. The order and mode of hydrogen atom transferred by CPA and tert&#8208;butyloxy have a significant influence on the enantioselectivity and energy barriers. The olefinic side product generated by &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination is 9.9 kcal/mol thermodynamically less favourable. A series of phosphoric acids are predicted as promising co&#8208;catalysts with lower barriers for O&#8211;O bond homolysis.</dc:description>

         <title>In Vitro Selection and Characterization of a DNAzyme Probe for Diverse Pathogenic Strains of Clostridium difficile</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Clostridium difficile frequently causes an infectious disease known as Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and there are urgent needs for the development of more effective rapid diagnostic tests for CDI. Previously we have developed an RNA&#8208;cleaving fluorogenic DNAzyme (RFD) probe named RFD&#8208;CD1, which is capable of detecting a specific strain of C. difficile but is too specific to recognize other pathogenic C. difficile strains. To overcome this issue, herein we report RFD&#8208;CD2, another RFD that is not only highly specific to C. difficile but also capable of recognizing diverse pathogenic C. difficile strains. Extensive sequence and structure characterization establishes a pseudoknot structure and a significantly minimized sequence for RFD&#8208;CD2. As a fluorescence sensor, RFD&#8208;CD2 can detect C. difficile at a concentration as low as 100 CFU/mL, making this DNAzyme an attractive molecular probe for rapid diagnosis of CDI caused by diverse strains of C. difficile.</dc:description>

         <title>Protocell self&#8208;assembly driven by sodium trimetaphosphate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The co&#8208;evolution of peptide formation and membrane self&#8208;assembly is considered an essential step in the origin of life. In this study, we systematically investigated the sodium trimetaphosphate (P3m)&#8208;activated peptide formation reaction of Phe in an alkaline decanoic acid&#8208;decanol vesicle system. The experimental results showed that the peptide formation could competitively occur with N&#8208;acyl amino acid (NAA) formation. NAA formation did not follow the traditional P3m&#8208;activated peptide formation reaction involving the intermediate cyclic acylphosphoramidate (CAPA), but a phosphoric acid&#8208; decanoic acid mixed anhydride intermediate. NAA can form vesicles independently and reduce the critical vesicle concentration of the fatty&#8208;acid vesicles. 11 other representative amino acids, namely Ala, Asp, Glu, Gly, Ile, Leu, Pro, Ser, Thr, Val, and Arg, were selected for investigation. All of them reacted with decanoic acid to form NAA via the activation effect of P3m. Our experimental results indicate that the P3m activation effect can provide diversified raw membrane materials to form and stabilize protocell membranes; moreover, the small peptides, such as Phe&#8208;Leu, formed in the same reaction system can induce the amplification of primitive cells. This implies that synergistic symbiosis between membrane and peptide can be realized via the P3m activation effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Assembly and Gelating Behavior of (L)&#8208;Alanine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we designed and synthesized a low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight organogelator derived&#160;from (l)&#8208;amino acids. We performed gelation assays using (l)&#8208;amino acid derivatives to confirm the gelation ability, which was found to be high in several compounds. The (l)&#8208;alanine derivatives were determined to be excellent gelators, forming good gels even when smaller amounts were added. These results led to a library of amino acid&#8208;derived organogelators. In addition, the thermal properties of the (l)&#8208;alanine&#160;derivatives with high gelation performance were measured. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements revealed that the thermal stability of the gels could be controlled by changing the gelator concentration. The surface states of the obtained gels were observed by field&#8208;emission scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy measurements, which confirmed the structure of the self&#8208;molecular aggregates. Self&#8208;molecular aggregates were observed to be helical or sheet&#8208;like, and the gels were constructed by forming aggregates via self&#8208;molecular recognition.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing Clickable Acylated Glycerol Probes as Chemical Tools for Tracking Glycerolipid Metabolism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the use of clickable monoacylglycerol (MAG) analogs as probes for the general labeling of glycerolipids during lipid metabolism. Incorporation of azide tags onto the glycerol region was pursued to develop probes that would generally label glycerolipids, in which the click tag would not be removed through processes including acyl chain and headgroup remodeling. Analysis of clickable MAG probes containing acyl chains of different length resulted in widely variable cell imaging and cytotoxicity profiles.&#160; Based on these results, we focused on a probe bearing a short acyl chain (C4&#8208;MAG&#8208;N3) that was found to infiltrate natural lipid biosynthetic pathways to produce click&#8208;tagged versions of both neutral and phospholipid products. Alternatively, strategic blocking of the glycerol sn&#8208;3 position in probe C4&#8208;MEG&#8208;N3 served to deactivate phospholipid tagging and focus labeling on neutral lipids. This work shows that lipid metabolic labeling profiles can be tuned based on probe structures and provides valuable tools for evaluating alterations to general lipid metabolism in cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrating Regioselective E&#8594;Z Isomerization of Trienones with Cascade Sequences under Photosensitizer&#8208;Free Direct Irradiation at 390&#8197;nm</title>

Isomerization&#8208;enabled cascade: Conjugated polyenes undergo photosensitizer&#8208;free direct irradiation at 390&#8197;nm for the highly regioselective E&#8594;Z alkene isomerization and subsequent cascade sequences to stereoselectively provide bridged bicyclic products. The directionality results from the stabilizing n&#8594;&#960;* interactions.







Abstract
The regioselective E&#8594;Z isomerization of a target olefin unit embedded in a conjugated polyene is challenging. Examples are limited to retinal and its derivatives only. The problem is further amplified when such an isomerization is integrated into cascade sequences, among which the regioselectivity and subsequent directionality are the major bottlenecks. Indeed, there are no reports till date for such a transformation. Herein, it is reported that such a controlled isomerization and subsequent cyclization cascade can be enabled by photosensitizer&#8208;free direct irradiation of linearly conjugated acyclic polyenes in dichloromethane solvent using a 390&#8197;nm LED. The directionality results from deconjugation of the extended &#960;&#8208;system in the transient Z&#8208;isomer due to stabilizing n&#8594;&#960;* interactions between 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyls (C=O&#8594;C=O) or 1,4&#8208;carbonyl/&#8208;aryl (C=O&#8594;aryl) groups. The involvement of such noncovalent interactions has been supported by X&#8208;ray crystallography and control experiments. Thus, conjugated trienones can be stereoselectively converted into oxabicyclo[3.2.1]octadienes in an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economic manner, including the first example by regioselective isomerization of a tetrasubstituted alkene. The reaction conditions are very general (&gt;46 examples). The reaction can be conducted under open air atmosphere at ambient temperature. Such a cascade cyclization can also be realized in solid state.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Ring Opening of 3,4&#8208;Epoxy Amides and Esters with Aromatic Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbonyl&#8208;directed regio&#8208; and enantioselective ring opening reaction of 2,3&#8208;epoxy amides and esters has been developed by use of a chiral nickel/bipyridine complex as the catalyst.







Abstract
Herein we present a nickel&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and enantioselective ring opening reaction of 3,4&#8208;epoxy amides and esters with aromatic amines as nucleophiles. This method features high regiocontrol, diastereospecific SN2 reaction pathway, broad substrate scope, and mild reaction conditions, furnishing a wide range of &#947;&#8208;amino acid derivatives in a highly enantioselective manner. Notably, the selective nucleophilic attack to the C&#8208;4 position of epoxides is controlled by the directing effect of the pendant carbonyl group.

         <title>Site&#8208;selective Hydrogenation/Deuteration of Benzylic Olefins Enabled by Electroreduction Using Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electroreduction of benzylic olefins has been applied to site&#8208;selectively hydrogenate such double bonds while other functions that react under regular hydrogenation conditions are present. By the use of water as proton source this protocol also allows deuteration by simply switching to D2O. The applicability of this method was shown by the use of a commercially available electrolysis setup and a broad substrate scope.







Abstract
We describe an operationally simple and user&#8208;friendly protocol that allows the site&#8208;selective hydrogenation and deuteration of di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted benzylic olefins by electroreduction while other groups prone to hydrogenation are present. The radical anionic intermediates react with the most inexpensive hydrogen/deuterium source H2O/D2O. Our method overcomes many limitations that arise from previously reported electroreductive hydrogenations. The applicability of this reaction is demonstrated by a broad substrate scope (&gt;50 examples) that focuses on functional group tolerance and sites that are affected by metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation (alkenes, alkynes, protecting groups).

         <title>A BF2 Chelate Exhibiting Excimer&#8208;like Fluorescence with an Unusually Large Stokes Shift in the Crystalline Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excimer emission: Crystals of the target compound exhibit bright emission in the red region for which the spectral profile is broad and well separated from absorption transitions. The solid&#8208;state structure comprises tightly grouped molecular pairs that assemble into highly ordered columns while facilitating excimer formation at ambient temperature.







Abstract
The target mono&#8208;BF2 complex is weakly emissive in fluid solution because radiationless decay of the excited&#8208;singlet state is promoted through an intramolecular N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;N hydrogen bond. The lack of mirror symmetry for this compound is attributed to vibronic effects, as reported previously for the bis&#8208;BF2 complex (BOPHY). Red&#8208;shifted fluorescence is observed from single crystals, the emission quantum yield approaching 30&#8201;% with a fluorescence lifetime of 2&#8197;ns. The large Stokes shift of 5,700&#8197;cm&#8722;1 helps minimize self&#8208;absorption. Crystallography indicates that the internal fold and twist angles are increased substantially in the crystal, but the hydrogen bond is weakened relative to solution. The crystal structure is compiled from pairs of head&#8208;to&#8208;tail molecules having a shift of ca. 4.1&#8197;&#197; and closest approach of ca. 3.5&#8197;&#197;. These molecular pairs are arranged in columns, which, in turn, assemble into sheets. The proximity favors excitonic coupling between individual molecules, with the coupling strength obtained by analysis of the absorption spectrum reaching ca. 1,000&#8197;cm&#8722;1. Both the ideal dipole approximation and the extended dipole methodology seriously overestimate the coupling strength, but the atomic transition charge density procedure leads to good agreement with experiment. Emission is attributed to the closely coupled molecular pair functioning in an excimer&#8208;like manner with the exciton trapped in a local minimum. Increasing temperature causes a slight blue shift and loss of fluorescence.

         <title>Highly Efficient Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Semi&#8208;hydrogenation of Urea Derivatives to Formamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We discovered a new pathway (the urea derivatives underwent catalytic pyrolysis at first, followed by fast hydrogenation of the isocyanates) that enables rapid hydrogenation of urea derivatives to formamides even at lower H2 pressures (&lt;5&#8197;bar). This enables a two&#8208;step process of high&#8208;value CO2 utilization under mild pressures, including CO2 to urea derivatives and ureas hydrogenation.







Abstract
The utilization of CO2 as a non&#8208;toxic and cheap feedstock for C1 is a desirable route to achieve high value&#8208;added chemicals. In this context, we report a highly efficient ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed semi&#8208;hydrogenation reaction of CO2&#8208;derived ureas. Various alkyl and aryl urea derivatives were successfully hydrogenated to obtain the corresponding recyclable amines and formamides (up to 97&#8201;% yield), highlighting the good substrate applicability of this method, which makes this method a sustainable alternative for the hydrogenation of CO2 to formamides in the presence of amines. In the meantime, we have discovered a new pathway that enables rapid hydrogenation of urea derivatives even at lower H2 pressure (&lt;5&#8197;bar). This methodology might provide a new insight into the reduction functionalization of CO2 under mild pressure to form new C&#8722;N bond. Based on the control experiments and the observed intermediate products, we clarify the mechanism for selective semi&#8208;hydrogenation of ureas.

In the meantime, we have discovered a new pathway that enables rapid hydrogenation of urea derivatives even at lower H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pressure (&amp;lt;5&#8197;bar). This methodology might provide a new insight into the reduction functionalization of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under mild pressure to form new C&#8722;N bond. Based on the control experiments and the observed intermediate products, we clarify the mechanism for selective semi-hydrogenation of ureas.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phase&#8208;Dependent Long Persistent Phosphorescence in Coumarin&#8208;Phosphine&#8208;Based Coinage Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Improving the shining hour: Coumarin&#8208;functionalized aminodiphosphine and its copper and silver complexes of different nuclearities have been synthesized. The complexes exhibit unusual persistent phosphorescence with a lifetime as long as 1.5&#8197;s in solution at 77&#8197;K that is strongly dependent on phase and temperature.







Abstract
A coumarin functionalized aminodiphosphine has been introduced as a bidentate ligand in coinage metal chemistry. Mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and trimetallic copper and silver complexes were synthesized with this ligand. The hybrid character of the ligand led to compounds with rich luminescence properties. These include coumarin&#8208;based blue fluorescence, observed as a sole emission in solution at room temperature, and green phosphorescence, which is efficient at low temperatures and dominates the spectra of the metal complexes. In the rigid environment of frozen solutions, the green phosphorescence shows an unusually long (for metal complexes) decay on the seconds timescale in high quantum yield. In addition, a red phosphorescence, which may be assigned to the triplet state localized in the phosphine&#8208;M3Cl2 (M=Cu, Ag), is observed for the trinuclear complexes at low temperature. Neither the second&#8208;long phosphorescence nor the red emission is observed for the coumarin ligand, thus they must be a result of the coordination to coinage metal clusters. The excited states in these compounds were also investigated by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations.

         <title>Spin in Organic Cocrystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this Review, we highlight the recent advancement of the spin effect in organic cocrystals. Besides the magnetic and multiferroic properties in binary/ternary cocrystals and radical cocrystals, other spin phenomena (spin multiplicity, mechanoresponsive spin, chiral orbit and spin&#8208;crossover) and the mobility on spin transport are discussed. The better comprehension of current achievements and challenges could offer guidance for the further development of organic spintronics.







Abstract
Organic spintronics has caused a huge revolution in creating highly efficient low&#8208;power circuits. Spin manipulation in organic cocrystals has become a promising strategy to uncover more chemicophysical properties for diverse applications. In this Minireview, we summarize the recent advancements of spin properties in organic charge&#8208;transfer cocrystals, and briefly describe the possible mechanisms behind them. Beside the known spin properties (spin multiplicity, mechanoresponsive spin, chiral orbit and spin&#8208;crossover) in binary/ternary cocrystals, other spin phenomena in radical cocrystals and spin transport are also summarized and discussed. Hopefully, deep understanding of current achievements, challenges and perspectives will offer the clear direction for the introduction of spin in organic cocrystals.

         <title>Better Peptides via Chemical Glycosylation: Somatostatin Analogues Having a Human Complex&#8208;Type N&#8208;Glycan with Improved Drug Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A haloacetamidyl glycan with no protecting group on the hydroxy and carboxy groups can be readily used in combination with Cys&#8208;scanning performed across any peptide and protein sequences to produce glycosylated analogues having a native complex&#8208;type glycan. Chemical glycosylation represents a powerful tool for the development of peptide and protein analogues superior to the original molecules with enhanced drug properties.







Abstract
Somatostatin (somatotropin release&#8208;inhibiting factor, SRIF) is a growth hormone inhibitory factor in the form of a 14&#8208; or 28&#8208;amino acid peptide. SRIF affects several physiological functions through its action on five distinct SRIF receptor subtypes (sst1&#8211;5). Native SRIF has only limited clinical applications due to its rapid degradation in plasma. To overcome this obstacle, we have developed glycosylated SRIF analogues that possess not only metabolic stability but also high affinity to all five receptor subtypes by attaching human complex&#8208;type oligosaccharides. Such glycosylated SRIF analogues with improved pharmacokinetic profiles could be potent and novel therapeutic drugs for SRIF&#8208;related diseases in which several SRIF receptor subtypes are closely involved, and also shed light on new indications. Our results show that chemical glycosylation can be a powerful tool for the development of peptide and protein analogues superior to the original molecules with enhanced drug properties.

         <title>Extended q&#8208;Range X&#8208;Ray Scattering Reveals High&#8208;Resolution Structural Details of Biomacromolecules in Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detailed atomic structural information of biomacromolecules in their native solution statues over several magnitude length scales was revealed by extended q&#8208;range X&#8208;ray scattering data and pair distribution function analysis.







Abstract
We communicate a feasibility study for high&#8208;resolution structural characterization of biomacromolecules in aqueous solution from X&#8208;ray scattering experiments measured over a range of scattering vectors (q) that is approximately two orders of magnitude wider than used previously for such systems. Scattering data with such an extended q&#8208;range enables the recovery of the underlying real&#8208;space atomic pair distribution function, which facilitates structure determination. We demonstrate the potential of this method for biomacromolecules using several types of cyclodextrins (CD) as model systems. We successfully identified deviations of the tilting angles for the glycosidic units in CDs in aqueous solutions relative to their values in the crystalline forms of these molecules. Such level of structural detail is inaccessible from standard small angle scattering measurements. Our results call for further exploration of ultra&#8208;wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering measurements for biomacromolecules.

         <title>Entangled, Hofmeister effect&#8208;enhanced macromolecular adhesives for effective bonding in dynamic seawater</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deployment of adhesives in natural seawater to in situ bond is urgently needed in engineering fields. However, stable adhesion in natural seawater remains a challenge due to the dynamic environment and high ion concentration. Herein, we reported an entangled, Hofmeister effect&#8208;enhanced macromolecular underwater adhesive (EHUA) for practical application in dynamic seawater. EHUA was synthesized via a facile one&#8208;step copolymerization. After transferred into seawater, the solvent of EHUA was exchanged to seawater, and thereby hydrogen bonds inside the adhesive were activated and enhanced by Hofmeister effect. We demonstrated EHUA can adhere on the surface in dynamic seawater, and the adhesive strength could reach 1.691 MPa. In addition, the adhesives also exhibited long&#8208;term storage stability and convenient recyclability. These fascinating properties enable adhesives to seal leaky pipelines, repair damaged ship and construct buildings in dynamic seawater. This work may open an avenue for the design of adhesives for natural seawater environment.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A single amino acid in a peptide sequence can play an important role to tune the self&#8208;assembly and hydrogelation behaviour. Here, a C&#8208;terminal cysteine&#8208;containing ultrashort peptide hydrogelator forms hydrogel through non&#8208;covalent and covalent interactions. Interestingly, the hydrogel is insoluble in water and buffer solutions at different pH values (1&#8208;13) and is thixotropic and injectable. In recent years, removing dyes from contaminated water has become a significant concern because of the shortage of freshwater resources. Therefore, the adsorption of dyes through a reliable, straightforward, nontoxic, cheap, and environmentally friendly adsorbent has become a popular topic. Hence, the hydrogelator was exploited to remove organic dyes from wastewater, harnessing its applicability in the gel phase and solid supports (filter paper and cotton).</dc:description>

         <title>Effects of Central Elements on the Properties of Group 13 Dialdiminate Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The series of luminescent complexes with the dialdimine ligand were prepared by changing the central atom in the group 13 elements. In the solution states, their absorption wavelengths and responses to Lewis bases apparently depended on the central atom. The aluminum complexes exhibited the blue&#8208;shift of the absorption maxima compared to the gallium and indium congeners. It is probably because the aluminum complex has lower&#8208;lying highest&#8208;occupied molecular orbital than other complexes. Additionally, the emission intensity was clearly changed in response to a Lewis base, especially in the case of the aluminum complex. Quantum chemical calculations suggested that these element&#8208;dependent optical properties could be originated from the difference in the electric charges on the central elements. Interestingly, the ligand exchange reactions were observed in the indium complexes together with the changes in the optical properties and controlled by the addition of InCl3 and InMe3. Furthermore, all the complexes showed the aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) and crystallization&#8208;induced emission enhancement (CIEE) properties. These results lead to proposing a practical strategy for manipulating the optoelectronic properties coupled with the reactivities of complexes by choosing the central elements in the same group.</dc:description>

         <title>Interaction Modes between SF4 and Ketones; Study of Intermediates in Deoxofluorination Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interactions between ketones and SF4 are studied for the simplest ketone, acetone, and the bulky polycyclic 2&#8208;adamantanone. Acetone forms the 1:2 adduct SF4&#183;[O=C(CH&#173;3)2]2, as well as the dimeric 1:1 adducts [SF4&#183;O=C(CH&#173;3)2]2 as identified by low&#8208;temperature Raman spectroscopy and, for the latter, X&#8208;ray crystallography. In both adducts, SF4 acts as a double chalcogen&#8208;bond donor to two keto groups. In contrast 2&#8208;adamantanone does not form an isolable solid adduct with SF4; in the presence of HF, however, it forms SF4&#183;O=C10H14O&#183;HF, which comprises chains with weak S&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;O and S&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;FH chalcogen bonds in the crystal structure. Sulfur tetrafluoride in this compound is readily lost at &#8211;85 &#176;C, leading to the isolation of C10H14O&#183;HF at low temperature. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations aid in vibrational assignments and serve to describe the interactions of the keto group with SF4 and HF, as well as interactions between SF4 with HF. It is found that separate and combined CO&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;HF and CO&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;SF4 chalcogen bonds do not polarize the C=O group to any significant degree.</dc:description>

         <title>Stimuli responsive features of organic RTP materials: an intriguing carbazole&#8208;cyclic triimidazole derivative</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimuli responsive luminescent materials possessing room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are extremely desirable for various applications. The here investigated derivative of cyclic triimidazole (TT) functionalized with carbazole (Cz), namely TT&#8208;Ph&#8208;Cz, belongs to this class. TT&#8208;Ph&#8208;Cz possesses high conformational freedom resulting in rigidochromic and multi&#8208;stimuli responsive emissive behavior. It has been isolated as MeOH&#8208;solvated and de&#8208;solvated forms characterized by distinctive emissive features. In particular, the solvated form, in which hydrogen bonds with MeOH inhibit competitive non&#8208;radiative deactivation channels, possesses a higher quantum yield associated with a strong phosphorescence contribution which is preserved in DMSO/water solutions.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Transition between Discrete and 1D Infinite Architectures: a Temperature&#8208;Responsive Cu(I) Complex with a Flexible Disilane&#8208;bridged Bis(pyridine) Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thermoresponsive molecular structure based on a disilane&#8208;bridged bis(pyridine) ligand and CuI is reported. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis revealed that there are two polymorphs in the Cu(I) complex: octanuclear copper(I) complex at 20 &#176;C and 1D staircase copper(I) polymer complex at &#8722;196 &#176;C. The formation of these polymorphs is due to the flexibility of ligand. Cu&#8210;I bond formation is observed upon cooling the sample from &#8210;10 &#176;C to &#8210;170 &#176;C. The temperature&#8208;induced phase transition progression was clarified by DSC, VT&#8208;PXRD, and VT&#8208;photoluminescence measurements and indicated a reversible temperature&#8208;controlled crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal phase transition. Observation on a VT&#8208;stage using a high&#8208;speed camera showed crystal cracking during single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal transitions between these polymorphic forms.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of ternary bismuth&#8208;based heterojunction using (BiO)2CO3 as electron bridge for highly efficient degradation of phenol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by nature, it has been considered an effective approach to design artificial photosynthetic system by fabricating Z&#8208;scheme photocatalyst to eliminate environmental issues and alleviate the global energy crisis. However, the development of low cost, environment&#8208;friendly, and high&#8208;efficient photocatalysts by utilizing solar energy still confronts huge challenge. Herein, we constructed Bi2O3/(BiO)2CO3/Bi2MoO6ternary heterojunction via a facile solvothermal method and calcination approach and used it as a photocatalyst for the degradation of phenol. The optimized Bi2O3/(BiO)2CO3/Bi2MoO6 heterojunction delivers a considerable activity for phenol photodegradation with an impressive removal efficiency of 98.8% and about total organic carbon (TOC) of 68% within 180 min under visible light irradiation. The excellent photocatalytic activity was ascribed to the formation of a Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction, more importantly, the presence of (BiO)2CO3 as an electron bridge greatly shortens the migration distance of photogenerated electron from ECB of Bi2O3 to EVB of Bi2MoO6, thus prolonging the lifetime of photogenerated electrons, which is verified by trapping experiments, electron spin&#8208;resonance spectroscopy (ESR) results, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work provides a potential strategy to fabricate highly efficient Bi&#8208;based Z&#8208;scheme photocatalysts with wide application prospects in solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion and environmental protection.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Inspired by nature, it has been considered an effective approach to design artificial photosynthetic system by fabricating Z-scheme photocatalyst to eliminate environmental issues and alleviate the global energy crisis. However, the development of low cost, environment-friendly, and high-efficient photocatalysts by utilizing solar energy still confronts huge challenge. Herein, we constructed Bi2O3/(BiO)2CO3/Bi2MoO6ternary heterojunction via a facile solvothermal method and calcination approach and used it as a photocatalyst for the degradation of phenol. The optimized Bi2O3/(BiO)2CO3/Bi2MoO6 heterojunction delivers a considerable activity for phenol photodegradation with an impressive removal efficiency of 98.8% and about total organic carbon (TOC) of 68% within 180 min under visible light irradiation.

This work provides a potential strategy to fabricate highly efficient Bi-based Z-scheme photocatalysts with wide application prospects in solar-to-fuel conversion and environmental protection.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Preparation of UFM1&#8208;Derived Probes through Highly Optimized Total Chemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ufmylation is involved in various cellular processes and associated with many human diseases. The understanding of this modification relies on the use of customized UFM1&#8208;derived probes for activity&#8208;based profiling of its related enzymes. Herein we present a highly optimized total chemical synthesis for the generation of diverse UFM1&#8208;derived probes including UFM1&#8208;PA, Biotin&#8208;UFM1&#8208;PA and UFM1&#8208;AMC, in which a UFM1 C&#8208;terminal valine hydrazide was readily prepared by hydrazide&#8208;based ligation and used as a versatile handle for the installation of enzyme&#8208;sensitive warheads and fluorescent reporters. The resulting probes display high reactivity and selectivity for UFM1&#8208;specific enzymes in cell lysates. This strategy facilitates the generation and diversity of the UFM1&#8208;derived toolkit that can be employed to profile UFM1&#8208;specific enzymes, thereby shining insights into the dynamics of ufmylation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A fluorenyl&#8208;tethered N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene LH (LH = [(Flu)H&#8208;(CH2)2&#8208;NHCDipp]) and its monoanionic version L&#8208; are explored in complexation with zinc towards the hydroboration of N&#8208;heteroarenes, carbonyl, ester, amide, and nitrile under ambient condition. The N&#8208;heteroarenes exhibit high 1,2&#8208;regioselectivity which is justified by computational analyses. The relative hydroboration rates of differently p&#8208;substituted (electron donating vs. withdrawing) pyridines are also addressed. The monodentate LH offers a better catalytic activity than the chelating L&#8208; for steric reasons despite both giving three&#8208;coordinate zinc complexes. The mechanism involves a Zn&#8208;H species at the heart of these catalytic processes which is trapped by Ph2CO. Computational studies suggest that the barrier to form the hydride complex is comparable to the barrier required for the following hydride transfer to pyridine.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Pyrimidine&#8208;Based Iridium Complexes with Bulky Charge&#8208;Carrier Groups as Dopants for Highly Efficient Green Polymer Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel pyrimidine&#8208;based iridium complexes ((TPAPr)2IrAcac and (TPSPr)2IrAcac) with triphenylamine and tetraphenylsilane were fully synthesized and characterized. (TPSPr)2IrAcac with bulky tetraphenylsilane group, which can efficiently suppress the concentration quenching, achieved its highest current efficiency (CE) at higher dopant concentration. Highly efficient green phosphorescent polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) are achieved by using (TPAPr)2IrAcac and (TPSPr)2IrAcac as dopants.







Abstract
Two new pyrimidine&#8208;based iridium complexes with triphenylamine and tetraphenylsilane, namely (TPAPr)2IrAcac and (TPSPr)2IrAcac, were fully synthesized and characterized. Both of the targeted iridium complexes exhibit excellent thermal stability and high photoluminescence quantum yields. Compared to (TPAPr)2IrAcac, (TPSPr)2IrAcac achieved its highest PLQY and current efficiency (CE) at higher dopant concentration probably because of its bulky tetraphenylsilane group, which can effectively suppress the concentration quenching. However, according to DFT studies, (TPSPr)2IrAcac shows faster non&#8208;radiative transitions due to the presence of more excited&#8208;state distortions than (TPAPr)2IrAcac. As a result, Green phosphorescent polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) containing (TPAPr)2IrAcac and (TPSPr)2IrAcac as dopants exhibit exceptional device performance with peak CE values of 38.24 and 36.06&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1, respectively. (TPAPr)2IrAcac exhibited a superior efficiency than (TPSPr)2IrAcac because of its high &#934;p, low RMSD value, and efficient energy transfer from the host to the guest. More importantly, the PLEDs based on (TPAPr)2IrAcac and (TPSPr)2IrAcac show stable phosphorescent emission with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.313, 0.497) and (0.299, 0.483), respectively. This work points out a viable method for creating phosphorescent iridium complexes based on pyrimidine for high&#8208;efficiency organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs).

         <title>Functional Characterisation of Highly Conserved and Structurally Prominent Residues of 2&#8208;Methylisoborneol Synthase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new 2&#8208;methylisoborneol synthases phylogenetically unrelated to the known enzyme from Streptomyces coelicolor (ScMIBS) were functionally characterised. ScMIBS was extensively investigated by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis in 31 positions that were selected based on the enzyme structure and their high conservation, revealing several structural motifs that are important for catalysis.







Abstract
2&#8208;Methylisoborneol is a widespread musty odourant that is produced by many bacteria including actinomycetes, cyanobacteria and myxobacteria. Two 2&#8208;methylisoborneol synthases (MIBS) that are phylogenetically distant to the known enzyme from Streptomyces coelicolor were found to be highly active for 2&#8208;methylisoborneol biosynthesis. Based on the enzyme structure and on an amino acid sequence alignment, the MIBS from S. coelicolor was extensively studied through site&#8208;directed mutagenesis.

         <title>Divergent Reaction of Indoline&#8208;derived Azadienes with &#945;&#8208;Bromohydroxamates: Synthesis of Spiro&#8208;indolinepyrrolidinones and Indoline&#8208;fused Diazepinones</title>

         <dc:description>
Spiro&#8208;indolinepyrrolidinones and indoline&#8208;fused diazepinones were synthesized through Cs2CO3&#8208;promoted formal [2+3] and [4+3] cycloadditions of indoline&#8208;derived azadienes and &#945;&#8208;bromohydroxamates. Thirty&#8208;six examples of the target compounds were obtained in up to 89&#8201;% yield. This work expands the scope of products that are available through annulation reactions of indoline&#8208;derived azadienes, thus expanding the toolbox to access valuable indole derivatives for diverse applications.







Abstract
A divergent reaction of indoline&#8208;derived azadienes with &#945;&#8208;bromohydroxamates for the selective synthesis of spiro&#8208;indolinepyrrolidinones and indoline&#8208;fused diazepinones was disclosed. This reaction sequence involved an initial formation of five&#8208;membered spirocyclic products followed by an intramolecular ring&#8208;opening and ring expansion to produce seven&#8208;membered diazepinones. We demonstrated that controlling the reaction time could modulate the reaction pathway for formation of different molecular frameworks for the same set of substrates. Based on the experimental results, the reaction mechanism was also discussed and proposed to explain the phenomena observed in the process.

         <title>Trapping of a Transient Base&#8208;Stabilised Alumylene and Alumylene&#8208;Type Reactivity of a Self&#8208;Stabilising Dialumene towards Organic Azides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An NHC&#8208;stabilised aluminium(III) terphenyl dihalide was reduced in the presence of alkynes to trap the in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed alumylene [NHC(Ter)Al:]. In the absence of an alkyne the reduction yielded a self&#8208;stabilised dialumene, which showed alumylene&#8208;like reactivity towards organic azides.







Abstract
The reduction of a carbene&#8208;coordinated, sterically encumbered terphenyl&#8208;substituted aluminium diiodide, (LRAlI2), yielded a &#8220;masked&#8221; dialumene (LRAl=AlRL), self&#8208;stabilised through [2+2] cycloaddition with a peripheral aromatic group. During the course of the reaction, a carbene&#8208;stabilised arylalumylene (LRAl:) was generated in&#8197;situ, which was trapped using an alkyne, generating an aluminacyclopropene or a C&#8722;H activated product thereof, depending on the steric bulk of the alkyne. The masked dialumene also underwent intramolecular cycloreversion and dissociation into alumylene fragments, which reacted with various organic azides to yield monomeric or dimeric iminoalanes depending on the sterics of the azide substituent. The thermodynamics of monomeric and dimeric iminoalane formation were probed by theoretical calculations.

         <title>Exchange Interactions and Magnetic Properties of a Molecular Mn18&#8208;Ring Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and characterization of the compound [Mn3O(OAc)7(HOAc)]6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;x&#8201;AcOH (x=6&#8211;9) is reported. It contains molecular Mn18&#8208;rings which are built from six [Mn3(&#956;3&#8208;O)(&#956;2&#8208;OAc)6(AcOH)]&#8208;units interconnected by acetate anions. Field and temperature dependent magnetic susceptibility measurements on the compound show weak ferromagnetic interactions between these Mn18&#8208;units in the solid. DFT and ab&#8208;initio multi reference methods (CASSCF/NEVPT2) allowed to simulate the magnetic susceptibility versus temperature dependence of the compound in terms of basically uncoupled magnetic moments of each Mn3&#8208;subunit within the Mn18&#8208;ring.







Abstract
[Mn3O(OAc)7(HOAc)]6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;x&#8201;AcOH (x=6&#8211;9) represents a rare example of a compound containing molecular Mn18&#8208;rings. These are formed by Mn3(&#956;3&#8208;O) subunits in which the high&#8208;spin Mn(III) centers are bridged by three pairs of acetate anions (AcO&#8722;). An AcOH molecule coordinates to one of the Mn atoms leading to [Mn3(&#956;3&#8208;O)(&#956;2&#8208;OAc)6(AcOH)]&#8208;units, designated in short as Mn3&#8208;units, that are interconnected by acetate anions via the other two Mn atoms to form Mn18&#8208;rings. Magnetic measurements show weak ferromagnetic interactions between them that are suppressed in strong magnetic field. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations on Mn3 model complexes using independently DFT and ab&#8208;initio multi reference methods (CASSCF/NEVPT2) show a correlation between the orientation of the pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8208;Teller axes of pairs of Mn(III) magnetic centers and corresponding exchange coupling energies. Weak coupling between Mn3&#8208;units within the Mn18&#8208;ring allowed to simulate the magnetic susceptibility versus temperature dependence in terms of basically uncoupled magnetic moments of each Mn3&#8208;unit within the ring.

         <title>Inverting the Electronic Structure of Diylidylgermylenes by Backbone Modification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Germylenes with two ylide&#8208;substituents are usually highly nucleophilic species. Herein, we demonstrate that introduction of a cyano moiety into the ylide backbone decreases the LUMO energy and thus significantly enhances the electrophilic nature of these species. This is reflected in the reactivity but also in the molecular structure of the diylidylgermylene.







Abstract
Owing to the strong electron&#8208;donating ability of ylide substituents, diylidyltetrylenes are usually highly nucleophilic species with strong donor capacities. Here, we demonstrate that their electronic properties are in fact highly flexible and can be effectively tuned through variation of the substituent in the ylide backbone. Initial density functional theory studies showed that cyano groups are particularly capable in lowering the LUMO energy of diylidyl germylenes thus turning these usually highly nucleophilic species into electrophilic compounds. This was confirmed by experimental studies. Attempts to synthesize the germylene (YCN)2Ge [with YCN=Ph3P&#8208;(C)&#8208;CN] from the corresponding metalated ylide YCNK selectively led to germanide [(YCN)3Ge)K]2 thus reflecting the electrophilic nature of the intermediate formed germylene. XRD analysis of single crystals of (YCN)2Ge &#8211; serendipitously obtained through protonative cleavage of one ylide from the germanide &#8211; revealed a monomeric structure with rather long Ge&#8208;ylide linkages, which corroborates well with a pure single bond and no stabilization of the empty p&#960; orbital at germanium through &#960; bonding. The germanide exhibits methanide&#8208;like reactivity towards chalcogens but a likewise weak Ge&#8722;C bond as demonstrated by the insertion of carbon dioxide.

         <title>Substituent and Solvent Effect Studies of N&#8208;Alkenylnitrone 4&#960; Electrocyclizations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>

         <title>Diverse Roles of ScSERF in Modifying the Fibril Growth of Amyloidogenic Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ScSERF shows distinct effects on the fibril formation of FUS&#8208;Core, FUS&#8208;LC and &#945;&#8208;Synuclein. The positively charged N&#8208;terminus of ScSERF competes to bind with the negatively charged C&#8208;terminus of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein accelerating its amyloid fibril formation. The interaction of ScSERF with monomeric FUS&#8208;Core and FUS&#8208;LC inhibits both the primary nucleation formation and later the elongation of fibrils.







Abstract
The aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins is often related to the occurrence of neurodegenerative diseases, including fused in sarcoma protein (FUS) in frontotemporal lobar degeneration and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis diseases. Recently, the SERF protein family has been reported to have a significant regulatory effect on amyloid formation, but it is still unclear about the detailed mechanisms of SERF acting on different amyloidogenic proteins. Herein, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy were used to explore interactions of ScSERF with three amyloidogenic proteins FUS&#8208;LC, FUS&#8208;Core, and &#945;&#8208;Synuclein. NMR chemical shift perturbations reveal them sharing similar interaction sites on the N&#8208;terminal region of ScSERF. However, the amyloid formation of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein protein is accelerated by ScSERF, while ScSERF inhibits fibrosis of FUS&#8208;Core and FUS&#8208;LC proteins. Both the primary nucleation and the total amount of fibrils produced are detained. Our results suggest a diverse role of ScSERF in regulating the fibril growth of amyloidogenic proteins.

         <title>Coexistence of Three Different Spin States in a Cyanido&#8208;Bridged Trinuclear Iron(III) Complex with an Unusual FeIII to Ligand Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A trinuclear iron(III) complex trans&#8208;[CpMe3FeIII(dppe)(CN)]2[FeIII(LN4)][PF6]4 with the innocent ligand (LOxN4)&#8722; exhibits an unusual coexistence of one S=3/2 and two S=1/2 spin states and an uncommon MLCT from FeIII to the ligand LOxN4.







Abstract
We report a trinuclear iron(III) cyanido&#8208;bridged complex trans&#8208;[CpMe3FeIII(dppe)(CN)]2[FeIII(LN4)][PF6]4 (2[PF6]4) as the oxidation product of binuclear complex [CpMe3(dppe)FeIICN&#8208;FeIII(LN4)][PF6] (1[PF6]) (CpMe3=1, 2, 4&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;cyclo&#8208;pentadienyl, dppe=1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane, LN4=pentane&#8208;2,4&#8208;dione&#8208;bis(S&#8208;methylisothiosemicarbazonato). Complex 1[PF6] possesses an intermediate&#8208;spin five&#8208;coordinated FeIII (S=3/2) which couples antiferromagnetically to the &#960;&#8208;radical ligand (L&#8901;N4)2&#8722; and shows a LMCT (ligand to metal charge transfer) transition from (L&#8901;N4)2&#8722; to FeIII and the FeII&#8594;FeIII MMCT transition. Upon oxidation of 1[PF6], (L&#8901;N4)2&#8722; loses one electron to be the strong electron&#8208;attracting ligand (LOxN4)&#8722; and the intermediate&#8208;spin five&#8208;coordinated FeIII (S=3/2) becomes a low&#8208;spin six&#8208;coordinated FeIII (S=1/2) in 2[PF6]4. Also interestingly, 2[PF6]4 presents the coexistence of three different spin states (one S=3/2 and two S=1/2) and an uncommon FeIII&#8594;(LOxN4)&#8722; MLCT transition, confirmed by the experimental results and supported by the TDDFT calculations.

         <title>Electronic Structure and Aromaticity of an Unusual Cyclo[18]carbon Precursor, C18Br6
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigation of an uncommon cyclo[18]carbon precursor: The analyses of the electronic structure, bonding character, electron delocalization, and response to an external magnetic field indicate that C18Br6 is a globally aromatic species with lower aromaticity than cyclo[18]carbon (C18), and the blocking of in&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208;conjugation by the presence of &#8208;Br substituents in it is the underlying cause for the weakening of molecular aromaticity.







Abstract
Herein, the electronic structure and bonding character of the stable cyclo[18]carbon (C18) precursor, C18Br6, are thoroughly characterized by molecular orbital (MO), density of states (DOS), bond order (BO), and interaction region indicator (IRI) analyses. The delocalization characters of out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208;electrons (labeled as &#960;out&#8208; and &#960;in&#8208;electrons, respectively) in bonding regions were examined using localized orbital locator (LOL) and electron localization function (ELF). The aromaticity was investigated, studying the molecular magnetic response to external magnetic field by computing the magnetically induced current density (Jind), iso&#8208;chemical shielding surface (ICSS), anisotropy of the induced current density (AICD), and the induced magnetic field (Bind). All these analyses indicate that C18Br6 is a globally aromatic species with lower aromaticity than C18, and the blocking of in&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208;conjugation (labeled as &#960;in&#8208;conjugation) by the presence of &#8208;Br substituents in it is the underlying cause for the weakening of molecular aromaticity.

         <title>Traceless N&#8208;Polyfluoroalkylation of Weakly Nucleophilic Nitrogen Containing Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;polyfluoroalkylation reactions are challenging due to the high cost, toxicity or environmental impact of commonly used polyfluoroalkylation reagents. We report the sulfuryl fluoride (SO2F2)&#8208;mediated N&#8208;polyfluoroalkylation of weakly nucleophilic nitrogen compounds from readily available fluorinated alcohols. This method opens access to a variety of N&#8208;polyfluoroalkylated building blocks that are highly valuable for life science applications.







Abstract
Here we report an efficient access to high&#8208;value N&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl anilines, primary polyfluoroalkylamines and N,N&#8208;bis(polyfluoroalkyl)amines, via N&#8208;polyfluoroalkylation of sulfonamides and phthalimide derivatives using sulfuryl fluoride (SO2F2). The in&#8197;situ formation of polyfluoroalkyl fluorosulfonates from commercially available fluorinated alcohols and economical sulfuryl fluoride is highly advantageous given that some polyfluoroalkyl halides are ozone&#8208;depleting substances (ODS) regulated by the Montreal protocol. This general method is applied to the polyfluoroalkylation of a variety of sulfonamides, N&#8208;sulfonyl carbamates and phthalimide with a wide tolerance of functional groups. The process thus provides viable access for industry to N&#8208;(polyfluoroalkyl)anilines as well as primary and secondary N&#8208;(polyfluoroalkyl)amines, which are very valuable but not easily accessible building blocks for life science applications.

   &lt;b&gt;N&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-polyfluoroalkylation reactions&lt;/b&gt; are challenging due to the high cost, toxicity or environmental impact of commonly used polyfluoroalkylation reagents. We report the sulfuryl fluoride (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)-mediated &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-polyfluoroalkylation of weakly nucleophilic nitrogen compounds from readily available fluorinated alcohols. This method opens access to a variety of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-polyfluoroalkylated building blocks that are highly valuable for life science applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we report an efficient access to high-value &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-polyfluoroalkyl anilines, primary polyfluoroalkylamines and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-bis(polyfluoroalkyl)amines, via &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-polyfluoroalkylation of sulfonamides and phthalimide derivatives using sulfuryl fluoride (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The in&#8197;situ formation of polyfluoroalkyl fluorosulfonates from commercially available fluorinated alcohols and economical sulfuryl fluoride is highly advantageous given that some polyfluoroalkyl halides are ozone-depleting substances (ODS) regulated by the Montreal protocol. This general method is applied to the polyfluoroalkylation of a variety of sulfonamides, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-sulfonyl carbamates and phthalimide with a wide tolerance of functional groups. The process thus provides viable access for industry to &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-(polyfluoroalkyl)anilines as well as primary and secondary &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-(polyfluoroalkyl)amines, which are very valuable but not easily accessible building blocks for life science applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metallic and Dimensional Optimization of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystallographic dimensions and metallic categories of MOFs are optimized in controlling polysulfides and catalyzing conversion. S supported on 2D&#8208;Ni&#8208;MOF/CNTs exhibits longer lifetime and superior rate capability, due to the highly exposed Ni nuclei. This work pioneered the avenue of sieving decent LSBs cathodes through optimizing the dimensions and metals of MOFs synergistically.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs) have been considered as one of the most promising energy storage systems owing to their high theoretical energy density and abundant sulfuric resources. However, their commercial application is limited by rapid capacity decline and low Coulombic efficiency. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) made of metallic nodes and organic ligands can suppress polysulfide shuttling and promote redox kinetics. In this paper, the effects of crystallographic dimensions and metallic categories on chemical performance of LSBs have been meticulously explored electrochemical performance. As a result, exposed Ni active sites in a lamellar Ni&#8208;MOF was found to deliver a superior electrochemical performance. The as&#8208;assembled LSBs with 2D&#8208;Ni&#8208;MOF/CNTs cathode deliver a much superior initial discharge capacity, (820&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;C), and exhibit excellent cycling stability over 550&#8197;cycles than those analogues of 3D stereoscopic Ni&#8208;MOF and 2D lamellar Co&#8208;MOF. This work proposed a perspective in elevating LSBs performance through synergistic optimization of the MOFs dimensions and the metallic nuclei in the cathodes.

         <title>Insight into the Evolution Track for the Metathesis of Alkenes within Hierarchical Zeolite&#8208;Based Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Evolution track within hierarchical zeolite: A new functionality of mesoporosity is disclosed as the intrazeolitic interface boundary with alumina phase, which enables the creation of evolution track for the active metathesis catalysts. The working track requires the indispensable engagements from intracrystalline mesoporous surface, alumina slices, and zeolitic Br&#248;nsted acid sites.







Abstract
The usage of hierarchical MFI zeolite enables a boost of the catalytic performance of Mo&#8208;based catalysts for the olefin&#8208;metathesis reaction. The harvest of active catalysts roots in a segmental evolution track between hierarchical zeolite and Al2O3 slices for the fabrication of active sites. The working evolution track requires the indispensable engagements from intracrystalline mesoporous surface, Al2O3 slices, and zeolitic Br&#248;nsted acid sites. The infilling of disaggregated Al2O3 slices into the intracrystalline mesopores triggers the creation of localized intrazeolite&#8722;Al2O3 interfaces, which enables the subsequent migration and trapping of surface molybdates into the micropores. The insulation of intrazeolite&#8722;Al2O3 interface or shielding of zeolitic Br&#248;nsted acid sites leads to the break of the evolution track. Our findings disclose the hidden functionality of mesoporosity as intrazeolite interface boundary for the fabrication of active sites and supply a new strategy for the rational design of zeolite catalysts.

         <title>Waxberry&#8208;Like MnS/Ni3S4 as High&#8208;Efficiency Bi&#8208;Functional Catalyst for Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Waxberry&#8208;like MnS/Ni3S4 was successful prepared through a sulfuration process. MnS/Ni3S4 catalysts showed good oxygen evolution reactions (Ej=10=1.55&#8197;V) and oxygen reduction reactions (E1/2=0.81&#8197;V). When the catalyst was used in Zn&#8211;air batteries as the cathode, it showed excellent cycle stability (308&#8197;h) and small voltage gap (0.83&#8197;V &amp; 0.86&#8197;V) at 5&#8197;mA cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
In this paper, a waxberry&#8208;like MnS/Ni3S4 composite catalyst was designed and synthesized. In this coating structure, MnS is located inside and Ni3S4 is wrapped on the surface to form a spherical structure. This structure makes the material show excellent stability in the electrocatalytic process. The diffusion staggered region structure formed at the two&#8208;phase interface greatly enhances the synergistic interaction between MnS and Ni3S4. At the same time, the defects and vacancies formed by the diffusion mechanism at the interface of the two phases increase the active site and improve the interfacial electron transfer kinetics. Therefore, MnS/Ni3S4 composites showed good catalytic performance for ORR/OER. At 10&#8197;mA cm&#8722;2, the overpotential of it is only 320&#8197;mV, and the half&#8208;wave potential can reach 0.81&#8197;V. The catalyst also exhibited extraordinary cycle stability and small voltage gap when used as cathode of Zn&#8208;air batteries. When the current density is 3&#8197;mA cm&#8722;2, the cyclic discharge can be stable for 400&#8197;h and the voltage difference between the front and back does not increase more than. When the current density increases to 5&#8197;mA cm&#8722;2, the cyclic charge and discharge can be stable for more than 300&#8197;h.

         <title>Tetraphenylethene&#8208;Based cis/trans Isomers for Targeted Fluorescence Sensing and Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetraphenylethene derivatives with adjustable molecular geometry emerge as an attractive paradigm for the development of smart and versatile chemical probes. In this review, the configuration&#8208;dependent molecular recognition, aggregation&#8208;induced emission and bioactivities of cis/trans tetraphenylethene&#8208;based isomers are summarized. Facilitated by the unique properties, their applications in fluorescence detection, bioimaging and targeted therapy are discussed.







Abstract
Molecular probes which can be modulated, functionalized and used to visualize the processes are highly desirable for understanding and manipulating biological systems. Geometric cis and trans isomers of tetraphenylethene (TPE) emerge as attractive candidates to fulfill these tasks thanks to the unique aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties, tailorable structures, and responsiveness to external stimuli. This minireview focuses on cis and trans isomers of TPE derivatives that are functionalized with molecular recognition units for fluorescence detection, bioimaging and cancer therapy. The effects of molecular geometry on fluorescence property, target binding ability and biological activity are summarized. The feasibility to in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo switch molecular configuration and thus bio&#8208;activity is discussed. Finally, the future development and challenges are discussed in view of TPE&#8208;based stereoisomers for targeted sensing and imaging&#8208;guided modulation of biological processes.

         <title>Four&#8208;Membered Bimetallic Carbon Complex [(MCp*)2(&#956;&#8208;NPh)(&#956;&#8722;C)] (M = Fe, Ru, Os) &#8211; An Ambiphilic Carbene with Lone Pair and &#963;&#8208;Hole Reactivity</title>

         <dc:description>Singlet carbenes are extensively studied compounds capable of electrophilic, nucleophilic or ambiphillic behaviour. The ambiphilic reactivity of singlet carbenes have been conventionally observed in orthogonal planes. Here, we report a detailed bonding and reactivity study of a homobimetallic carbon complex [(MCp*)2(&#956;&#8208;NPh)(&#956;&#8208;C)] (1M, M = Fe, Ru, Os) that shows ambiphilicity in the same direction. The structure of this complex can be considered as two fused three&#8208;membered M&#8208;C&#8208;M and M&#8208;N&#8208;M rings. The bonding analysis suggests that these 17VE homobimetallic complexes have one formal M&#8208;M bond with a bridging carbene centre featuring a high lying spn&#8208;hybridised lone pair. Accordingly, the carbene centre shows high proton affinity and act as a good 2e&#8208; donor to Lewis acids and transition metal fragment. Apart from the transition metal non&#8208;bonding electrons, the &#960;&#8208;framework of M&#8208;C&#8208;M and M&#8208;N&#8208;M arms can be best described as 3c&#8208;2e&#8208; bonds. The two transition metals in the four&#8208;membered skeleton generate many low&#8208;lying, virtual orbitals. These low&#8208;lying virtual orbitals induces electron excitation from the spn&#8208;hybrid orbital in presence of H&#8208; and other 2e&#8208; donor ligands such as PMe3, NHC and CO. Hence, the spn&#8208;hybrid lone pair orbital shows &#963;&#8208;hole reactivity in presence of Lewis bases.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of a Rhenanaphthalene Isomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Exploration of organometallic metallacycles has led to the development of various polycyclic compouds with fascinating structures, which could be used as functional materials. In this work, a new rhenanaphthalene isomer was isolated from the reaction of ReH5(PMe2Ph)3 with o&#8208;ethynylphenyl alkyne in the presence of excess HCl. Its structure was then identified using the single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy. DFT studies suggest that its formation involves two protonation reactions and two migration reactions. This new rhenanaphthalene isomer enriches the family of metallacycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Small molecular fluorescent probes for Alzheimer's disease associated active species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and is the main cause of dementia worldwide. As the pathogenesis of AD is quite complicated, there is continuous attention to AD&#8208;associated active species, such as amyloid&#8208;&#946; plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, metal ions, reactive oxygen/nitrogen/sulphurspecies, cholinesterase, viscosity, formaldehyde and so on. To this end, a series of small molecular fluorescent probes for these active species have been explored for early diagnosis and even remedy of AD. Herein, we systematacially summarize the versatile fluorescent probes mainly in recent three years, including the relationship between the structure and properties as well as the targeted diagnosis and imaging application of all these fluorescent probes. Moreover, the challenges and perspectives of the AD&#8208;related fluorescent probes are briefly explicated. We firmly expect this review may provide guidance for constructing new AD&#8208;relevant fluorescent probes and promote the clinical study of AD.</dc:description>

         <title>From Proton to Boron: The Lewis Analogs of Protonated Br&#248;nsted Super Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isolation and characterization of highly reactive intermediates are crucial to understand the nature of chemical reactivity. Accordingly, the reactivity of weakly coordinating anions (WCA), usually used to stabilized cationic super electrophiles are of fundamental interest. When a variety of WCA are known to form stable &#963;&#8208;complexes with a proton, inducing Br&#248;nsted super acidity, bis&#8208;coordinated weak&#8208;coordinated anions are much more elusive and considered as long&#8208;sought reactive species. In this work, the chemistry of borylated sulfate, triflimidate and triflate anions where scouted in details with the aim of synthetizing the unique analogs of protonated Br&#248;nsted superacids. Those complexes were formed by successive borylation with a 9&#8208;boratriptycene derived Lewis super acid paired with a weak coordinated anion, characterized in solution and in the solid state and exhibit unique structures and reactivities.</dc:description>

         <title>The Origin of Catalysis and Regioselectivity of Lewis Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions with Tropone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have studied the uncatalyzed and Lewis acid (LA)&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition reaction between tropone and 1,1&#8208;dimethoxyethene using dispersion&#8208;corrected relativistic density functional theory (DFT). The LA catalysts BF3, B(C6H5)3, and B(C6F5)3 efficiently accelerate both the competing [4+2] and [8+2] cycloaddition reactions by lowering the activation barrier up to 12 kcal mol&#8211;1 compared to the uncatalyzed reaction. Our study reveals that the LA catalyst promotes both cycloaddition reaction pathways by LUMO&#8208;lowering catalysis and demonstrates that Pauli&#8208;lowering catalysis is not always the operative catalytic mechanism in cycloaddition reactions. Judicious choice of the LA catalyst can effectively impart regiocontrol of the cycloaddition: B(C6H5)3 furnishes the [8+2] adduct while B(C6F5)3 yields the [4+2] adduct. We discovered that the regioselectivity shift finds its origin in the ability of the LA to absorb distortion by adopting a trigonal pyramidal geometry around the boron atom.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Stereochemistry of the NH Bond Activation of Ammonia or Amines by Disilenes: Predictability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stereochemistry of the addition of NH3 to the stereoisomers of 1,2&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylphenyl)disilene (Z&#8208;5 or E&#8208;5) is 100 % stereospecific giving two isomeric disilylamines 6 and 7, respectively, derived from syn&#8208;addition to the stereoisomeric disilenes. Variable Time Normalization Analysis studies of the reaction of tetramesityldisilene (3) with isopropylamine (iPrNH2) revealed that the order in both amine and disilene is 1. The kinetic isotope effect for the addition of iPrNH2/iPrND2 to tetramesityldisilene was determined to be 3.04 &#177; 0.06 at 298 K, a primary KIE, indicating that the proton is transferred in the rate determining step. Competition studies between the addition of PrNH2 and iPrNH2 to tetramesityldisilene resulted in the exclusive formation of the PrNH2 adduct consistent with a nucleophilic addition. Computational studies of the mechanism of the addition of ammonia to E&#8208;5 revealed the lowest energy pathway involves the formation of the donor adduct derived from syn&#8208;addition, followed by intramolecular syn&#8208;transfer of the proton. The results of this study&#160;allow for a refinement of our understanding of the mechanism of this important fundamental reaction in disilene chemistry, and allow us to understand our ability to reliably predict the stereochemical outcomes of future NH &#963;&#8208;bond activation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>De Novo Design of pre&#8208;miR&#8208;21 Maturation Inhibitors: Synthesis and Activity Assessment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeting RNA with small molecules is a major challenge of current medicinal chemistry, and the identification and design of original scaffolds able to selectively interact with an RNA target remains difficult. Various approaches have been developed based on classical medicinal chemistry strategies (fragment&#8208;based drug design, dynamic combinatorial chemistry, HTS or DNA&#8208;encoded libraries) as well as on advanced structural biology and biochemistry methodologies (such as X&#8208;ray, cryo&#8208;EM, NMR, or SHAPE). Here, we report the de novo design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of RNA ligands using a straightforward and sustainable chemistry combined with molecular docking and biochemical and biophysical studies that allowed us to identify a novel pharmacophore for RNA binding. Specifically, we focused on the targeting of biogenesis of microRNA&#8208;21, the re&#8208;known oncogene. This led us not only to promising inhibitors but also to a better understanding of the interactions formed between the small molecule compounds and the RNA target paving the way for the rational design of efficient inhibitors with potential anticancer activity.</dc:description>

         <title>A Massively Parallel Double&#8208;Selection Workflow for the Evolution of Molecular Switches Based on Surface&#8208;Display in Escherichia coli</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microbial surface display of proteins is a versatile method for a wide range of biotechnological applications. Here, we present the use of a surface display system in E. coli for the evolution of a riboswitch from an RNA aptamer. To this end a streptavidin&#8208;binding peptide (SBP) is displayed at the bacterial surface, which can be used for massively parallel selection using a magnetic separation system. Coupling gene expression from a riboswitch library to the display of SBP hence allows selection of library members that express strongly in the presence of a ligand. As excessive SBP expression leads to bacterial growth inhibition, it can be used to negatively select against leaky riboswitches expressing in the absence of ligand. Based on this principle, we devise a double selection workflow that enables quick selection of functional riboswitches with a comparatively low screening workload. We demonstrate the efficiency of our protocol by re&#8208;discovering a previously isolated theophylline riboswitch from a library as well as a novel riboswitch that is similar in performance, but slightly more responsive at low theophylline concentrations. Our workflow is massively parallel and can be applied to the screening or pre&#8208;screening of large molecular libraries.</dc:description>

         <title>Matched Ligands for Small, Stable Colloidal Nanoparticles of Copper, Cuprous Oxide and Cuprous Sulfide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work applies organometallic routes to copper(0/I) nanoparticles and describes how to match ligand chemistries with different material compositions. The syntheses involve reacting an organo&#8208;copper precursor, copper(I)mesityl [CuMes]z (z = 4, 5), at low temperatures and in organic solvents, with hydrogen, air or hydrogen sulfide to deliver Cu, Cu2O or Cu2S nanoparticles. Use of sub&#8208;stoichiometric quantities of protonated ligand (pro&#8208;ligand; 0.1&#8208;0.2 equivalents vs. [CuMes]z) allows saturation of surface coordination sites but avoids excess pro&#8208;ligand contaminating the nanoparticle solutions. The pro&#8208;ligands are nonanoic acid (HO2CR1), 2&#8208;[2&#8208;(2&#8208;methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid (HO2CR2) or di(thio)nonanoic acid, (HS2CR1), and are matched to the metallic, oxide or sulfide nanoparticles. Ligand exchange reactions reveal that copper(0) nanoparticles may be coordinated by carboxylate or di(thio)carboxylate ligands, but Cu2O is preferentially coordinated by carboxylate ligands and Cu2S by di(thio)carboxylate ligands. This work highlights the opportunities for organometallic routes to well&#8208;defined nanoparticles and the need for appropriate ligand selection.</dc:description>

         <title>Studies on Structural Changes of Modified MWCNTs: Material for Electrochemical Monitoring of Antiviral Drug in Human Serum Samples</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functionalized electrochemical material (Hg/KR&#8208;1@MWCNT) is a potentially selective material for real&#8208;time electrochemical monitoring of harmful antiviral drug 5&#8208;iodo&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;iododeoxyuridine (IUdR) levels in human serum samples with LOD 13.6&#8197;nM.







Abstract
The development of a universal approach for precisely tuning the electrochemical characteristics of conducting carbon nanotubes for tracking harmful agents in the human body with high selectivity and sensitivity remains a challenge. Herein, we describe a simplistic, versatile, and general approach to the construction of functionalized electrochemical material. The design of electrochemical material consists of (i) modification of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) with dipodal naphthyl&#8208;based dipodal urea (KR&#8208;1) through non&#8208;covalent functionalization (KR&#8208;1@MWCNT) which enhances the dispersibility of MWCNT and hence conductivity, (ii) complexation of KR&#8208;1@MWCNT with Hg2+ accelerate the electron transfer in the material which amplify the detection response of functionalized material (i.&#8201;e., Hg/KR&#8208;1@MWCNT) towards various thymidine analogues. Further, the application of functionalized electrochemical material (Hg/KR&#8208;1@MWCNT) achieves real&#8208;time electrochemical monitoring of harmful antiviral drug 5&#8208;iodo&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;iododeoxyuridine (IUdR) levels in human serum for the first time.

         <title>The Adsorptive Separation of Ethylene from C2 Hydrocarbons by Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have evoked much attention in gas storage and separation. In this review, recent advances in the adsorptive separation of ethylene from C2 hydrocarbons by metal&#8211;organic frameworks are summarized from the aspects of removing C2H2 from the C2H4, obtaining C2H4 from C2H4 and C2H6 mixtures, and separation of multi&#8208;component mixtures, respectively. In addition, some perceptions toward their development and challenge are introduced.







Abstract
Separating ethylene (C2H4) from the C2 hydrocarbons is of prime industrial importance for the process of high&#8208;purity C2H4 as an essential raw material in the petrochemical industry. Due to their similar physicochemical properties, the separation of C2H4 from the C2 hydrocarbons typically entails high&#8208;energy separation technologies such as cryogenic distillation and extraction. Alternatively, adsorption separation using metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are low&#8208;energy separation technologies that manufacture high&#8208;purity gas under mild conditions. In this review, we summarized the recent advances in MOFs for the separation and purification of C2H4 from the C2 hydrocarbons. The mechanisms underlying separating C2H4 from the C2 hydrocarbons using MOFs are also highlighted. This review also discussed the major challenges and developments of MOFs to separate C2H4 from the C2 hydrocarbons.

         <title>Chiral and Structural Polymorphism of Fibril Architectures of Homologous Lysozymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multimodal approach involving chiroptical spectroscopies (VCD, ECD) and microscopic methods, in particular cryo&#8208;EM, was used to characterize chirality and structure of lysozyme amyloid fibrils. Rich polymorphism was observed for fibrils of hen egg white and human lysozymes with variations in the secondary structures, protofilament handedness and mesoscopic structures.







Abstract
Amyloid fibrils are fascinating and complex structures with the multilayered chiral organization. Using the multimodal methodology, including VCD, ECD, cryo&#8208;EM, and TEM, we characterized in detail different levels of organization (secondary structure/protofilament/mesoscopic structure) of amyloid fibrils prepared from proteins highly homologous in the structure (hen egg white and human lysozymes). Our results demonstrate that small changes in the native protein structure or preparation conditions translate into significant differences in the handedness and architecture of the formed fibrils at various levels of their complexity. In particular, fibrils of hen egg white and human lysozymes obtained in&#8197;vitro at the same preparation conditions, possess different secondary structure, protofilament twist and ultrastructure. Yet, formed fibrils adopted a relatively similar mesoscopic structure, as observed in high&#8208;resolution 3D cryo&#8208;EM, scarcely used up to now for fibrils obtained in&#8197;vitro in denaturing condition. Our results add to other puzzling experiments implicating the indeterministic nature of fibril formation.

Using the multimodal methodology, including VCD, ECD, cryo-EM, and TEM, we characterized in detail different levels of organization (secondary structure/protofilament/mesoscopic structure) of amyloid fibrils prepared from proteins highly homologous in the structure (hen egg white and human lysozymes). Our results demonstrate that small changes in the native protein structure or preparation conditions translate into significant differences in the handedness and architecture of the formed fibrils at various levels of their complexity. In particular, fibrils of hen egg white and human lysozymes obtained &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt; at the same preparation conditions, possess different secondary structure, protofilament twist and ultrastructure. Yet, formed fibrils adopted a relatively similar mesoscopic structure, as observed in high-resolution 3D cryo-EM, scarcely used up to now for fibrils obtained &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt; in denaturing condition. Our results add to other puzzling experiments implicating the indeterministic nature of fibril formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Autonomous and Programmable Reorganization of DNA&#8208;Based Polymers Using Redox Chemistry

Programmable DNA assembly: Here we have rationally re&#8208;engineered DNA tiles that can co&#8208;assemble into tubular structures and can be orthogonally deactivated/re&#8208;activated with redox&#8208;controlled DNA fuel strands. By controlling the relative rate of re&#8208;assembly of each tile, we can regulate the tiles distribution in the final co&#8208;polymer. The approach can be coupled with enzymatic fuel&#8208;degradation reactions and responds to external stimuli (i.&#8201;e., pH) providing an additional level of control in the reconfiguration of DNA&#8208;polymers.







Abstract
We demonstrate here a strategy that allows the programmable and autonomous reorganization of self&#8208;assembled DNA polymers using redox chemistry. We have rationally designed different DNA monomers (tiles) that can co&#8208;assemble into tubular structures. The tiles can be orthogonally activated/deactivated with disulfide&#8208;linked DNA fuel strands that are degraded over time upon reduction because of the presence of a reducing agent in the system. The concentration of the disulfide fuels determines the activation kinetics of each DNA tile, which controls the degree of order/disorder in the formed co&#8208;polymer. The disulfide&#8208;reduction pathway can be employed together with enzymatic fuel&#8208;degradation pathways providing an additional level of control in the re&#8208;organization of DNA structures. Taking advantage of the different pH&#8208;sensitivities of disulfide&#8208;thiol and enzymatic reactions, we show that we can control the order in DNA&#8208;based co&#8208;polymers as a function of pH.

         <title>N&#8208;Doped Carbon Confined NiCo Alloy Hollow Spheres as an Efficient and Durable Oxygen Electrocatalyst for Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiCo@NC HS electrocatalyst with hollow structure have been constructed as a cost&#8208;efficient/durability bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts for Zn&#8208;air batteries. The synergistic effect in NiCo@NC HS can promote the activation of O2* and OH* intermediates by modulating the electronic structure, and resulting enhanced OER/ORR activities.







Abstract
Exploring cost&#8208;efficient/durability bifunctional electrocatalysts are of upmost importance for the practical application of metal&#8211;air batteries. However, preparing bifunctional electrocatalysts with the above three advantages remains conceptually challenging. This work reports the preparation of N&#8208;doped carbon confined NiCo alloy hollow spheres (NiCo@N&#8722;C HS) as bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst for Zn&#8208;air battery with a higher energy density (788.7&#8197;mWh&#8201;gZn&#8722;1) and outstanding cycling stability (over 200&#8197;h), which are more durable than the commercialized Pt/C+RuO2&#8208;based device. Electrochemical results and theoretical calculation demonstrate that the synergy in the NiCo@N&#8722;C accelerates the electronic transmission for improving activation of O2* and OH* intermediates and optimizing reacted free energy pathways, while the hollow structures exposure more active sites for improving the reaction kinetics and enhancing the activity of ORR/OER reaction. This work provides crucial understanding for constructing low&#8208;cost transition metal&#8208;based catalyst to overcome the efficiency and durability barriers of metal&#8208;air batteries for widespread applications.

         <title>Quest of Quadruple Bonding Between Two Main&#8208;Group Atoms in AeB&#8722; and AeC (Ae=Ca, Sr, Ba) and the Role of d Orbitals of Heavier Alkaline&#8208;Earth Atoms in Covalent Interactions</title>

The chemical bonds in the electronic triplet (3&#931;&#8722;) ground state of the alkaline earth boride anions AeB&#8722; (Ae=Ca, Sr, Ba) have four strongly polarized bonding orbitals, namely two doubly occupied &#963; orbitals HOMO and HOMO&#8208;1 and a pair of singly occupied degenerate &#960; orbitals SOMO and SOMO&#8217; with sd hybridized atomic orbitals of the atoms Ae.







Abstract
Quantum chemical calculations using ab initio methods at the MRCI+Q(6,8)/def2&#8208;QZVPP and CCSD(T)/def2&#8208;QZVPP levels as well as density functional theory are reported for the diatomic molecules AeB&#8722; and isoelectronic AeC (Ae=Ca, Sr, Ba). The boride anions AeB&#8722; have an electronic triplet (3&#931;&#8722;) ground state. The quintet (5&#931;&#8722;) state is 5.8&#8211;12.3&#8197;kcal/mol higher in energy and the singlet (1&#916;) state is 13.1&#8211;15.3&#8197;kcal/mol above the triplet. The isoelectronic AeC molecules are also predicted to have a low&#8208;lying triplet (3&#931;&#8722;) state but the quintet (5&#931;&#8722;) state is only 2.2&#8197;kcal/mol (SrC) and 2.9&#8197;kcal/mol (CaC) above the triplet state. The triplet (3&#931;&#8722;) and quintet (5&#931;&#8722;) states of BaC are nearly isoenergetic. All systems have rather strong bonds. The calculated bond dissociation energies of the triplet (3&#931;&#8722;) state are between De=38.3&#8211;41.7&#8197;kcal/mol for AeB&#8722; and De=49.4&#8211;57.5&#8197;kcal/mol for AeC. The barium species have always the strongest bonds whereas the calcium and strontium compounds have similar BDEs. The bonding analysis indicates that there is little charge migration in AeB&#8722; in the direction Ae&#8594;B&#8722; where the alkaline earth atoms carry positive charges between 0.09&#8197;e&#8211;0.22&#8197;e. The positive charges at the Ae atoms are much larger in AeC where the charge migration Ae&#8594;C is between 0.90&#8197;e&#8211;0.91&#8197;e. A detailed analysis of the interatomic interactions with the EDA&#8208;NOCV method shows that all diatomic species AeB&#8722; and AeC are built from dative interactions between Ae (1S, ns2) and B&#8722; or C (3P, 2&#8197;s22p&#960;12p&#960;&#8242;1). The eventually formed bonds in AeC are better described in terms of interactions between the ions Ae+ (2S, ns1)+C&#8722; (4S, 2&#8197;s22p&#960;12p&#960;&#8242;12p&#963;1). Inspection of the orbital interactions suggests that the alkaline earth atoms Ca, Sr, Ba use mainly their (n&#8208;1)d AOs besides the (n)s AOs for the covalent bonds. This creates a second energetically low&#8208;lying &#963;&#8208;bonding MO in the molecules, which feature valence orbitals with the order &#981;1 (&#963;&#8208;bonding)&lt;&#981;2 (&#963;&#8208;bonding)&lt;&#981;3 (degenerate &#960;&#8208;bonding). All four occupied valence MOs of AeB&#8722; and AeC are bonding orbitals. Since the degenerate &#960; orbitals &#981;3 are only singly occupied, the formal bond order is three.

Trisubstituted E&#8208;2&#8208;amidoacrylonitriles are produced by direct hydrocyanation of ynamides. Z isomers can be obtained selectively using a thermo&#8208;neutral catalyst&#8208;free photoisomerization.







Abstract
The fully regio&#8208; and stereoselective Zn&#8208;catalyzed hydrocyanation of ynamides is reported and represents a general access to various trisubstituted E&#8208;&#945;&#8208;enamidonitriles. The catalyst&#8208;free photoisomerization selectively yields the energetically comparable Z&#8208;stereoisomer. Finally, the synthetic potential of these new &#945;&#8208;enamidonitriles was evaluated through the synthesis of original heterocycles.

         <title>Organic&#8208;Inorganic Phenolic/POSS Hybrids Provide Highly Ordered Mesoporous Structures Templated by High Thermal Stability of PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP Diblock Copolymer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mesoporous PDDSQ hybrids were prepared by using PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP as a template by mediated the hydrogen bonding interaction through the hydroxyl (OH) groups of PDDSQ hybrid with the pyridine group of the P4VP block. The highly ordered structures reveal the high surface area and high pore volume that could be used in supercapacitor application.







Abstract
Anionic living polymerization was used to prepare a diblock copolymer of poly(styrene&#8208;b&#8208;4&#8208;vinyl pyridine) (PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP), and a phenolic resin with a double&#8208;decker silsesquioxane (DDSQ) cage structure was used to form a phenolic/DDSQ hybrid (PDDSQ&#8208;30 with 30&#8197;wt.% DDSQ). Strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding could be confirmed through the hydroxyl (OH) groups of PDDSQ hybrid with the pyridine group of the P4VP block in PDDSQ&#8208;30/PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP blends based on Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyses, where increasing PDDSQ concentrations resulted in a higher proportion of hydrogen&#8208;bonded pyridine groups. After thermal polymerization at 180&#8201;&#176;C, the self&#8208;assembled structures of these PDDSQ/PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP blends were revealed by data from small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), where the d&#8208;spacing increased with raising PDDSQ concentration. Because relatively higher thermal stability of the PDDSQ hybrid than pure phenolic resin and PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP template, we can obtain the long ranger order of mesoporous PDDSQ hybrids after removing the PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP template, which reveals the high surface area and high pore volume with cylindrical and spherical structures corresponding to the PDDSQ compositions that are rarely observed by using pure phenolic resin as the matrix and could be used in supercapacitor application.

         <title>Synthesis of Unprecedented &#945;/&#946;&#8208;Alternate (1&#8594;4)&#8208;Glucans via Stereoselective Iterative Glycosylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

A robust glycosylation protocol for the stereoselective construction of either 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;&#945;&#8208; or 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glucosidic linkage is disclosed, employing same donors (glycosyl N&#8208;phenyltrifluoroacetimidates) and single promoter (TMSNTf2) in different solvents (CH2Cl2/nitrile vs. CH2Cl2/THF), which enables the efficient synthesis of &#945;/&#946;&#8208;alternate (1&#8594;4)&#8208;glucans, an unprecedented hybrid of amylose and cellulose.







Abstract
Glucans are major biomaterials on the earth, with &#945;&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;glucans (i.&#8201;e., amylose) and &#946;&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;glucans (i.&#8201;e., cellulose) being the most abundant ones, which are relevant to energy storage and structural function, respectively. Interestingly, (1&#8594;4)&#8208;glucans with alternate &#945;/&#946;&#8208;linkages, namely herewith amycellulose, have never been disclosed in nature. Here we report a robust glycosylation protocol for the stereoselective construction of the 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;&#945;&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glucosidic linkages, which employs an optimal combination of glycosyl N&#8208;phenyltrifluoroacetimidates as donors, TMSNTf2 as promoter, CH2Cl2/nitrile or CH2Cl2/THF as solvents. A broad substrate scope has been demonstrated by coupling five imidate donors with eight glycosyl acceptors, in which most of the glycosylations lead to high yield and exclusively 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;&#945;&#8208; or 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;selectivity. Applying this glycosylation protocol and with an iterative manner, the unprecedented &#945;/&#946;&#8208;alternate (1&#8594;4)&#8208;glucans up to a 16&#8208;mer have been synthesized. Differently from amylose, that adopts a compact helicoidal arrangement, the synthetic amycellulose features an extended ribbon&#8208;like conformation, comparable to the extended shape of cellulose.

         <title>Oxidation State Tuning of Room Temperature Phosphorescence and Delayed Fluorescence in Phenothiazine and Phenothiazine&#8208;5,5&#8208;dioxide Dimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Relationships between prompt fluorescence, room temperature phosphorescence and thermally activated delayed fluorescence are established in a series of dimers of phenothiazine and its chemically oxidized congener phenothiazine&#8208;5.5&#8208;dioxide. This provides detailed insights into the interplay between the singlet and triplet manifolds of these heterocycles and emphasizes the complex functional electronic structure of phenothiazines.







Abstract
Heterocyclic dimers consisting of combinations of butterfly&#8208;shaped phenothiazine (PTZ) and its chemically oxidized form phenothiazine&#8208;5,5&#8208;dioxide (PTZ(SO2)) have been synthesized. A twist is imposed across the dimers by ortho&#8208;substituents including methyl ethers, sulfides and sulfones. X&#8208;ray crystallography, cyclic voltammetry and optical spectroscopy, underpinned by computational studies, have been employed to study the interplay between the oxidation state, conformational restriction, and emission mechanisms including thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP). While the PTZ(SO2) dimers are simple fluorophores, the presence of PTZ induces triplet&#8208;mediated emission with a mixed PTZ&#8208;PTZ(SO2) dimer displaying concentration dependent hallmarks of both TADF and RTP.

         <title>Towards a Rational Design of Antibody&#8208;Recruiting Molecules through a Computational Microscopy View of their Interactions with the Target Antibody</title>

Computational modelling of the interaction between antibody and hapten predict ternary complex formation by hapten&#8208;based chimeric antibody recruiting molecules.







Abstract
Antibody recruiting molecules (ARMs) are an innovative class of chimeric molecules, consisting of an antibody&#8208;binding ligand (ABL) and a target&#8208;binding ligand (TBL). ARMs mediate ternary complex formation between a target cell of interest for elimination and endogenous antibodies that are present in human serum. Clustering of fragment crystallizable (Fc) domains on the surface of antibody&#8208;bound cells mediate destruction of the target cell by innate immune effector mechanisms. ARMs are typically designed by conjugating small molecule haptens to a (macro)molecular scaffold, without considering the structure of the respective anti&#8208;hapten antibody. Here we report on a computational molecular modeling methodology that allows for studying the close contacts between ARMs and the anti&#8208;hapten antibody, considering (1) the spacer length between ABL and TBL; (2) the number of ABL and TBL, and (3) the molecular scaffold onto which these are positioned. Our model predicts the difference in binding modes of the ternary complex and predicts which ARMs are optimal recruiters. Avidity measurements of the ARM&#8208;antibody complex and ARM&#8208;mediated antibody recruitment to cell surfaces in&#8197;vitro confirmed these computational modeling predictions. This kind of multiscale molecular modelling holds potential for design of drug molecules that rely on antibody binding for their mechanism of action.

ARMs mediate ternary complex formation between a target cell of interest for elimination and endogenous antibodies that are present in human serum. Clustering of fragment crystallizable (Fc) domains on the surface of antibody-bound cells mediate destruction of the target cell by innate immune effector mechanisms. ARMs are typically designed by conjugating small molecule haptens to a (macro)molecular scaffold, without considering the structure of the respective anti-hapten antibody. Here we report on a computational molecular modeling methodology that allows for studying the close contacts between ARMs and the anti-hapten antibody, considering (1) the spacer length between ABL and TBL; (2) the number of ABL and TBL, and (3) the molecular scaffold onto which these are positioned. Our model predicts the difference in binding modes of the ternary complex and predicts which ARMs are optimal recruiters. Avidity measurements of the ARM-antibody complex and ARM-mediated antibody recruitment to cell surfaces in&#8197;vitro confirmed these computational modeling predictions. This kind of multiscale molecular modelling holds potential for design of drug molecules that rely on antibody binding for their mechanism of action.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photomodulation on Active Sites of Adsorbents: Controllable Adsorption Processes with Improved Efficiency</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photomodulation on adsorptive sites is an emerging strategy to achieve selective adsorption and efficient desorption. Compared with traditional adsorption techniques, active sites of photoresponsive adsorbents can be flexibly regulated by light irradiation based on the demands of adsorption process. This concept summarizes recent advances in this field and highlights the exquisite strategies of photoregulation on active sites.







Abstract
Adsorption is a widely applied technique in producing high&#8208;purity chemicals with advantages of low energy consumption, high selectivity, and mild operating conditions. However, traditional adsorbents have inflexible properties and suffer from the trade&#8208;off between selective adsorption and efficient desorption. Recently, the emerging photoresponsive adsorbents have provided new avenues for adsorption techniques. Active sites of photoresponsive adsorbents can be regulated through steric hindrance or tunable adsorbent&#8208;adsorbate interactions. Therefore, variation in adsorptive capacity is able to readily achieve through photomodulation, and the corresponding adsorption/desorption cycles are energy&#8208;saving. This concept mainly summarizes recent efforts on the fabrication and application of photoresponsive adsorbents with tunable active sites. Also, the future opportunities and critical challenges of photoregulation on adsorptive sites are presented.

         <title>Pyridone&#8208;Doped Acenes with Improved Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of monopyridone&#8208;doped acenes from anthracene to heptacene with improved stability have been synthesized. The pyridone unit demonstrates different nature in the doped acenes depending on the molecular length. The capacity of electron transport between the face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacked acene planes is preserved.







Abstract
Besides the peripheral modification, the introduction of heteroatoms to modulate the property of longer acenes with improved chemical stability has been extensively studied for their potential applications in organic electronics. However, the utilization of 4&#8208;pyridone, a common unit in the air&#8208; and photo&#8208;stable acridone and quinacridone, to decorate higher acenes with increased stability has not been realized yet. Here we present the synthesis of a series of monopyridone&#8208;doped acenes up to heptacene via the palladium&#8208;catalyzed Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination of aniline and dibromo&#8208;ketone. The effect of pyridone on the property of doped acenes were investigated experimentally and computationally. With the &#960;&#8208;extension of doped acenes, the pyridone ring shows the weakened conjugation and gradual loss of aromaticity. The doped acenes demonstrate enhanced stability in solution and maintain the electronic communication between the acene planes.

         <title>Engineering the BASHY Dye Platform toward Architectures with Responsive Fluorescence</title>

The structural and electronic extension of the boronic&#8208;acid&#8208;derived salicylidenehydrazone (BASHY) dye platform yields stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorophores with applications in fluorescence lifetime imaging of live cells.







Abstract
A set of nine boronic&#8208;acid&#8208;derived salicylidenehydrazone (BASHY) complexes has been synthesized in good to very good chemical yields in a versatile three&#8208;component reaction. In an extension to previous reports on this dye platform, the focus was put on the electronic modification of the &#8220;vertical&#8221; positions of the salicylidenehydrazone backbone. This enabled the observation of fluorescence quenching by photoinduced electron transfer (PeT), which can be reverted by the addition of acid in organic solvent (OFF&#8208;ON fluorescence switching). The resulting emission is observed in the green&#8208;to&#8208;orange spectral region (maxima at 520&#8211;590&#8197;nm). In contrast, under physiological pH conditions in water, the PeT process is inherently decativated, thereby enabling the observation of fluorescence in the red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR region (maxima at 650&#8211;680&#8197;nm) with appreciable quantum yields and lifetimes. The latter characteristic supported the application of the dyes in fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) of live A549 cells.

         <title>Rationalizing the Optimization of Detergents for Membrane Protein Purification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailored detergents. Guidelines are introduced based on the hydrophilic&#8208;lipophilic balance (HLB) concept, which was established by Griffin in 1949, to enable the directed structural optimization of detergents for the in&#8197;vitro investigation of membrane protein&#8208;lipid interactions.







Abstract
Membrane protein purification by means of detergents is key to isolating membrane&#8208;bound therapeutic targets. The role of the detergent structure in this process, however, is not well understood. Detergents are optimized empirically, leading to failed preparations, and thereby raising costs. Here we evaluate the utility of the hydrophilic&#8208;lipophilic balance (HLB) concept, which was introduced by Griffin in 1949, for guiding the optimization of the hydrophobic tail in first&#8208;generation, dendritic oligoglycerol detergents ([G1] OGDs). Our findings deliver qualitative HLB guidelines for rationalizing the optimization of detergents. Moreover, [G1] OGDs exhibit strongly delipidating properties, regardless of the structure of the hydrophobic tail, which delivers a methodological enabling step for investigating binding strengths of endogenous lipids and their role for membrane protein oligomerization. Our findings will facilitate the analysis of challenging drug targets in the future.

Like an octopus trapping its prey with wriggling arms, a palladium catalyst binds its quinoline substrate through multiple conformations en route to selective activation of a particular C&#8722;H bond.

         <title>Selective Valorization of Bio&#8208;derived Levulinic Acid and Its Derivatives into Hydrocarbons and Biochemicals by Using Hydrosilylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designing a new methodology for the valorization of biomass is of the utmost importance for creating a sustainable future. In this work, we report an efficient hydrosilylation&#8208;based strategy for the selective valorization of biomass&#8208;derived levulinic acid and its derivatives into value&#8208;added chemicals such as pentane&#8208;1,4&#8208;diol, pentan&#8208;2&#8208;ol, 2&#8208;MTHF and even C5 hydrocarbons by using cost&#8208;effective and nontoxic silanes and the commercially available catalyst B(C6F5)3 at room temperature.







Abstract
Herein we report an efficient hydrosilylation strategy to selectively defunctionalize biomass&#8208;derived levulinic acid into value&#8208;added chemicals such as pentane&#8208;1,4&#8208;diol, pentan&#8208;2&#8208;ol, 2&#8208;MTHF and C5 hydrocarbons by using cost&#8208;effective silanes and the commercially available catalyst B(C6F5)3 at room temperature. All reactions work well in chlorinated solvents but, as a greener alternative, most reactions can be run in toluene or solvent&#8208;less.

         <title>Deoxygenative Radical Boration of Inert Amides via a Combination of Relay and Cooperative Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One of the most challenging tasks in organic synthesis is to develop novel methodologies for rapid construction of complex molecules starting from easily available yet inert raw materials. In this context, multi&#8208;catalysis strategies have attracted great attention in the discovery of new reactivity profiles that may allow access to many difficult or unattainable transformations. So far the deoxygenative functionalization of ubiquitous amides is usually achieved by nucleophilic attack on the imine or iminium ion intermediate formed via activation of the C=O bond, these functionalization reagents were often confined to C&#8208;based nucleophiles, which largely limited the diversity of the resultant amines. Herein, we disclose a combined strategy of relay and cooperative catalysis with a triple iridium&#8208;photoredox&#8208;organocatalysis system to achieve an unprecedented reductive boration of amides, affording valuable &#945;&#8208;amino boron products which are viable building blocks. In this transformation, the Ir&#8208;catalyzed semi&#8208;reduction of amides is successfully incorporated with photo&#8208;organic catalyzed nucleophilic boryl radical addition, thus delivering the corresponding &#945;&#8208;boryl amines in high efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Intermolecular Dearomative 1,2&#8208;Amination/Carbonylation via Nucleophilic Addition of Simple Amines to Arene &#960;&#8208;Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of the privileged amino functionality is of paramount importance in organic synthesis. In contrast to the well&#8208;developed amination methods for alkenes, the dearomative amination of arenes is largely underexplored due to the inherently inert reactivity of arene &#960;&#8208;bonds and selectivity challenges. Herein, we report an intermolecular dearomative aminofunctionalization via direct nucleophilic addition of simple amines to chromium&#8208;bound arenes. This multicomponent 1,2&#8208;amination/carbonylation reaction enables rapid access to complicated alicyclic compounds containing amino and amide functionalities from benzene derivatives under CO&#8208;gas&#8208;free conditions, which also represents the first application of nitrogen&#8208;based nucleophiles in &#951;6&#8208;coordination&#8208;induced arene dearomatizations.</dc:description>

         <title>Dichotomy of Delocalization/Localization and Charge&#8208;Shift Bonding in Germanazene and Its Heavier Group 14 Analogues: A Valence Bond Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:&#160;We present here a valence bond analysis of structure and &#960;&#8208;delocalization in Ge3(NH)3, which models germanazene that was prepared by Power et al. To get a broader perspective, we explore the entire E3(NH)3 series (E=C, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb). Thus, while (4n+2)&#960; systems of carbon rings are aromatic with cyclic &#960;&#8208;delocalization, the E3(NH)3 rings are dominated by a nonbonded structure, wherein &#960;&#8208;lone pairs are localized on the N atoms. Nevertheless, these molecules enjoy large covalent&#8208;ionic resonance energies of 153.0, 86.6, 74.2, 61.2, and 58.9 kcal/mol, respectively, for E= C, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb. The covalent&#8208;ionic mixing in E3(NH)3 creates &#960;&#8208;systems, which are stabilized by charge&#8208;shift bonding. Thus, unlike in benzene, in Ge3(NH)3 delocalization of &#960;&#8208;electron pairs of the N atoms is primarily confined to the domains of their adjacent Ge atoms. These features carry over to the substituted germanazene, Ge3(NAr)3 (Ar = Ph).</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gels formed using a perylene bisimide (PBI) as a low molecular weight gelator can show the photothermal effect. Formation of the PBI radical anion results in new absorption bands forming, meaning that subsequent irradiation with a wavelength of light overlapping with the new absorption band leads to heating of the gel. This approach can be used to heat the gel, as well as the surrounding milieu. We show how we can use electrochemical methods as well as multicomponent systems to form the radical anion without the need for UV light, and how we can use the photothermal effect to induce phase transitions in the solutions above the gels by exploiting photothermal behavior.</dc:description>

         <title>Base&#8208;Triggered Oxidative Addition to Gold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The coordination of secondary phosphine oxides (SPO) was shown to efficiently promote the activation of C(sp2)&#8211;I bonds by gold, as long as a base is added (NEt3, K2CO3). These transformations stand as a new type of chelation&#8208;assisted oxidative addition to gold. The role of the base and the influence of the electronic properties of the P&#8208;ligand were analyzed computationally. Accordingly, the oxidative addition was found to be dominated by Au&#8594;(Ar&#8211;I) backdonation. In this case, gold behaves similarly to palladium, suggesting that the inverse electron flow reported previously (with prevailing (Ar&#8211;I)&#8594;Au donation, resulting in faster reactions of electron&#8208;enriched substrates) is a specific feature of electron&#8208;deficient cationic gold(I) complexes. The reaction gives straightforward access to (P=O,C)&#8208;cyclometallated Au(III) complexes. The possibility to chemically derivatize the SPO moiety at Au(III) was substantiated by protonation and silylation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Polysubstituted Enamides by Hydrogen Atom Transfer Alkene Isomerization Using Dual Cobalt/Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>M&#8208;HAT isomerization is a highly reliable method to access thermodynamically stable alkenes with high functional group tolerance. However, synthesis of heteroatom&#8208;substituted alkenes by M&#8208;HAT isomerization reaction is still underdeveloped. Herein, we report an enamide synthesis using M&#8208;HAT via a combination of cobalt and photoredox catalysis. This method tolerates a variety of functional groups including haloarenes, heteroarenes, free hydroxy groups, non&#8208;protected indoles, and drug derivatives. Furthermore, this method can isomerize styrene derivatives in good yield and E/Z selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>A brick&#8208;wall topological 2D covalent organic framework constructed from an H&#8208;shaped &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; monomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As an emerging porous crystalline material, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have received considerable research interests in terms of exploring new architectures and functions. Herein, we developed an unprecedented &#8220;H&#8208;shaped&#8221; monomer, upon self&#8208;polycondensation, which facilely produced a benzoimidazole&#8208;based COF (H&#8208;BIm&#8208;COF) with a rarely reported &#8220;brick&#8208;wall&#8221; topology. H&#8208;BIm&#8208;COF displayed high crystallinity, nano&#8208;sized porosity, large BET surface area of 507 m2 g&#8208;1, and high thermal and chemical stabilities. Interestingly, H&#8208;BIm&#8208;COF based membranes showed selective permeability towards different solvents related to the size and polarity of the guest molecule. Additionally, initial study suggested the COF displayed excellent rejection efficiency towards ionic dyes, e.g. chromium black T (99.7%) and rhodamine B (97.3%). This work provides insights into developing new topological COFs by designing monomers with new configuration.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium Catalyzed, Annulative Multiple C&#8208;H Bond Activations of BODIPYs to Access &#960;&#8208;Extended Polycyclic Heteroaromatic Molecules with Deep Red Emissions and self&#8208;aggregation Behaviors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aromatic ring fusion on BODIPY core can effectively tune its electronic property, and red&#8208;shift the absorption and emission wavelength. In this work, we report that a one&#8208;pot Pd(II) catalyzed multiple C&#8208;H activation to access acenaphtho[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs though the reaction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsubstituted&#8208;BODIPYs and 1,8&#8208;dibromonaphthalenes. These newly synthesized acenaphtho[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs revealed intensified deep red absorptions (639 &#8208; 669 nm) and emissions (643 &#8208; 683 nm), with high fluorescence quantum yields (0.53 &#8208; 0.84) in dichloromethane. Notably, these acenaphtho[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs exhibited well&#8208;defined self&#8208;aggregation behavior in water/THF mixture, and for instance, the absorption of 3a was red&#8208;shifted by 53 to 693 nm after forming&#160;aggregates.</dc:description>

         <title>Elucidating Conformational Dynamics and Thermostability of Designed Aromatic Clusters Using Protein Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aromatic residues form clusters in proteins and play essential roles in biological systems. However, the stabilization mechanism and dynamic behavior of aromatic clusters remain unclear. Here, we describe designed aromatic interactions confined within a protein cage to reveal how aromatic clusters affect protein stability. The crystal structures and calorimetric measurements indicate that the formation of inter&#8208;subunit phenylalanine clusters enhance the interactions of inter&#8208;helices and increase the melting temperature. Theoretical calculations suggest that this is caused by the transformation of the T&#8208;shaped geometry into &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking at high temperatures, and the hydration entropic gain. Thus, the isolated nano&#8208;environment in a protein cage allows reconstruction and detailed analysis of multiple clustering residues for elucidating the mechanisms of various biomolecular interactions in nature which can be applied to design of bionanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition Metal Vacancy in Layered Cathode Materials for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept focuses on the formation of transition metal (TM) vacancy, vacancy contained configurations for triggering oxygen redox, advanced characterization techniques for detecting TM vacancy and viable strategies to improve the reversibility of vacancy&#8208;induced oxygen redox for layered cathode materials of sodium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Anionic redox has been considered as a promising strategy to break the capacity limitation of cathode materials that solely relies on the intrinsic cationic redox in secondary batteries. Vacancy, as a kind of defect, can be introduced into transition metal layer to trigger oxygen redox, thus enhancing the energy density of layer&#8208;structured cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, the formation process, recent progress in working mechanisms of triggering oxygen redox, as well as advanced characterization techniques for transition metal (TM) vacancy were overviewed and discussed. Strategies applied to stabilize the vacancy contained structures and harness the reversible oxygen redox were summarized. Furthermore, the challenges and prospects for further understanding TM vacancy were particularly emphasized.

         <title>Ultrafast Electron Transfer Dynamics of Organic Polymer Nanoparticles with Graphene Oxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>

Poly&#8208;3&#8208;hexylthiophene nanoparticles with graphene oxide (p3ht NPs&#8208;GO &amp; p3ht NPs&#8208;RGO) were prepared, and revealed the properties of charge transfer complexes. Notably, ultrafast electron transfer in those composites was reported for the first time, and faster electron transfer in p3ht NPs&#8208;RGO implied that p3ht NPs&#8208;RGO might have higher application values for organic polymer solar cells.







Abstract
We prepared organic polymer poly&#8208;3&#8208;hexylthiophene (p3ht) nanoparticles (NPs) and graphene oxide (GO)/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) composites p3ht NPs&#8208;GO/RGO by using the reprecipitation method. We demonstrated that GO/RGO could improve the ordering and planarity of p3ht chains as well as the formation of p3ht NPs, and confirmed the effects of GO/RGO on the fluorescence and carrier transport dynamics of p3ht NPs by using femtosecond fluorescence upconversion and transient absorption (TA) techniques. Ultrafast electron transfer (&#8764;1&#8197;ps) between GO/RGO and p3ht NPs quenched the fluorescence of p3ht NPs, indicating excellent properties of p3ht NPs&#8208;GO/RGO as the charge transfer complexes. Efficient electron transfer may promote the applications of p3ht NPs&#8208;GO/RGO composites in organic polymer solar cells and photocatalysis. Moreover, RGO had stronger interfacial interactions and more matched conduction band energy levels with p3ht NPs than GO did, which implied that p3ht NPs&#8208;RGO might have greater application values than p3ht NPs&#8208;GO.

         <title>Tris(boranil) Columnar Liquid Crystalline Fluorophores: pseudo&#8208;Triphenylene Boron(III) Complexes with Peripheral N&#8722;B&#8722;O Linkages</title>

Photoluminescent tris(boranil) discotics derived from tris&#8208;anils exhibit room temperature columnar mesomorphism, and redox behavior.







Abstract
The borate complexes derived from salicylaldimine ligands, called boranils, possess a wide range of photophysical and electronic characteristics intrinsically. The unique combination of molecular rigidity, rendered by four&#8208;coordinate boron bridges, and extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation enable them to serve as technically feasible fluorescent materials (dyes). The incorporation of liquid crystallinity in these boron(III) complexes, especially the columnar (Col) mesomorphism, which is overlooked hitherto, would provide a new dimension to these complexes. Herein, we report the first examples of tris(boranil) discotic liquid crystal (LC) dyes that have been readily synthesized by treating tris(N&#8208;salicylideneaniline)s, (TSAN)s, with BF3.Et2O in the presence of an acid quencher. These C3&#8208;symmetric borate complexes self&#8208;assemble into the Col phase, existing over a wide thermal span including room temperature. The 2D periodic order of the Col phases shows dependence on the length of the peripheral tails. The photophysical measurements reveal the fluorescence emission in their two condensed states viz., solid and Col phase, and in solution. Their electrochemical, two&#8208;step oxidation process coupled with the aforesaid features upholds their significance in applied research.

         <title>The Aldol&#8208;Tishchenko Reaction of Butanone, Cyclobutanone and a 3&#8208;Pentanone Derived Sulfinylimine and DFT Calculations of the Stereo&#8208;determining Step</title>

Enantio&#8208; and diastereoenriched 1,3&#8208;aminoalcohols are a highly versatile class of molecules in organic synthesis. However, most of the current syntheses involve a multi&#8208;step approach and the stepwise introduction of the chiral centres. Herein, we describe a one&#8208;step, highly diastereoselective method to furnish derivatives of these compounds via a double&#8208;aldol&#8208;Tishchenko reaction of cyclic and acyclic chiral sulfinylimines.







Abstract
Herein, we present a highly diastereoselective method to furnish acyclic 3&#8208;amino&#8208;1,5&#8208;diol derivatives using a tandem double&#8208;aldol&#8208;Tishchenko protocol (dr up to &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1) using a butanone derived sulfinylimine. In most cases only 1 diastereomer predominates, from a possible 16. The reaction is also regioselective. In addition, the highly challenging cyclobutanone and 3&#8208;pentanone derivatives are also amenable to a double&#8208;aldol&#8208;Tishchenko reaction, although the dr values are modest. Despite that, clean single diastereomers can be isolated, which should prove very useful in medicinal chemistry and other areas. Detailed DFT calculations support the observed stereoselectivities in all cases, providing a rationale for the excellent dr values in the butanone series and the moderate values for the 3&#8208;pentanone class.

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Exploration of ESIPT in a Systematically Constructed Series of Benzimidazole Based Schiff Base Probes: Application as Chemosensors</title>

Chemosensors: The combined effect of ESIPT and C=N isomerization in benzimidazole and the substituted aminobenzoic acids bearing Schiff base probes is responsible for different spectral output in solid and solution states. Furthermore, these ESIPT active chemosensors can sense Cu2+ through the inhibition of keto&#8208;enol tautomerisation.







Abstract
Herein, we have utilized 2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)benzimidazole (HBI) to synthesize 3&#8208;(1H&#8208;benzoimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;5&#8208;methyl&#8208;benzaldehyde (HBIA) followed by three Schiff bases by using &#8211;ortho (H2BIo), &#8208;meta (H3BIdm) and &#8208;para (H2BIp) substituted amino benzoic acids and studied their photophysical properties. We have successfully derived molecular structures of HBI, HBIA and H3BIdm which reveals that in HBI and HBIA, the phenolic &#8722;OH is intramolecularly hydrogen bonded with sp2 N of benzimidazole group whereas in H3BIdm, it is hydrogen bonded with imine C=N of Schiff base moiety, which is responsible for different solid state emission properties of the reported compounds. Extensive experimental and theoretical studies show that for all three Schiff bases, in solution due to activation of C=N isomerization, ESIPT operates through benzimidazole site and displays different emission from the solid state. Furthermore, H2BIo, H3BIdm and H2BIp selectively sense Cu2+ in semi aqueous medium with nano&#8208;molar detection limit and in HuH&#8208;7 cells through the inhibition of ESIPT of process.

         <title>Cooperativity&#8208;Driven Reactivity of a Dinuclear Copper Dimethylglyoxime Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
First check your solvent: In a dinuclear dimethylglyoxime copper(II) complex, hydrolysis of one ligand is facilitated by the cooperative effect of both CuII ions. Hydrolysis yields butane&#8208;2,3&#8208;dione monoxime and NH2OH; depending on the solvent used, the latter is either oxidized to N2O (in CH3CN) or reduced to NH4+ (in ethanol). A combined approach of experimental, theoretical, and spectroscopic methods allowed the reaction mechanism to be suggested.







Abstract
In this report, we present the dinuclear copper(II) dimethylglyoxime (H2dmg) complex [Cu2(H2dmg)(Hdmg)(dmg)]+ (1), which, in contrast to its mononuclear analogue [Cu(Hdmg)2] (2), is subject to a cooperativity&#8208;driven hydrolysis. The combined Lewis acidity of both copper centers increases the electrophilicity of the carbon atom in the bridging &#956;2&#8208;O&#8722;N=C&#8208;group of H2dmg and thus, facilitates the nucleophilic attack of H2O. This hydrolysis yields butane&#8208;2,3&#8208;dione monoxime (3) and NH2OH that, depending on the solvent, is then either oxidized or reduced. In ethanol, NH2OH is reduced to NH4+, yielding acetaldehyde as the oxidation product. In contrast, in CH3CN, NH2OH is oxidized by CuII to form N2O and [Cu(CH3CN)4]+. Herein are presented the combined synthetic, theoretical, spectroscopic and spectrometric methods that indicate and establish the reaction pathway of this solvent&#8208;dependent reaction.

         <title>A Multiresponsive Calix[6]arene Pseudorotaxane Empowered by Fluorophoric Dansyl Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multiresponsive pseudorotaxane, composed by a dansyl calix[6]arene and a bipyridinium axle, is presented. The disassembly of this complex can be triggered by: i) protonation of the dansyl units (chemical stimulus); ii) electrochemical reduction of the bipyridinium unit (electrochemical stimulus); iii) photochemical reduction of the bipyridinium unit, enabled by photoinduced electron transfer from the dansyl units (light stimulus). Overall, three orthogonal and reversible stimuli can be employed to control the stability of this novel pseudorotaxane.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and characterization, by means of NMR and UV&#8208;visible spectroscopy and electrochemical techniques, of a dansyl calix[6]arene derivative and of its pseudorotaxane complex with a bipyridinium&#8208;based axle. This novel macrocycle shows remarkable complexation ability, in analogy with parent compounds, while the dansyl moieties impart valuable features to the system. Indeed, these units: i) signal the state of the system by fluorescence; ii) can be reversibly protonated, enabling the modulation of the complexation abilities of the macrocycle; iii) participate in photoinduced electron transfer processes, which may be exploited to tune the stability of the supramolecular complex. Therefore, in this multiresponsive pseudorotaxane, the threading and de&#8208;threading motions of the molecular components can be modulated either by protonation of the calixarene host or by reduction of the bipyridinium guest, which can be accomplished both by electrochemical reduction and via photoinduced electron transfer. Overall, three orthogonal and reversible stimuli can be used to induce molecular movements of the pseudorotaxane components.

From diquat to dye&#8208;cat. A series of push&#8211;pull dyes using diquat as the electron&#8208;acceptor moiety have been synthesized. Their photocatalytic abilities were tested in the aerobic thiocyanation of indoles and pyrroles, giving yields of up to 97&#8201;%.







Abstract
A series of new organic donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor dyes incorporating a diquat moiety as a novel electron&#8208;acceptor unit have been synthesized and characterized. The analytical data were supported by DFT calculations. These dyes were explored in the aerobic thiocyanation of indoles and pyrroles. Here they showed a high photocatalytic activity under visible light, giving isolated yields of up to 97&#8201;%. In addition, the photocatalytic activity of standalone diquat and methyl viologen through formation of an electron donor acceptor complex is presented.

         <title>Aqueous Binders Compatible with Ionic Liquid Electrolyte for High&#8208;Performance Aluminum&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The suitability of aqueous binders for aluminum ion batteries (AIBs), especially the compatibility with ionic liquids and the distribution on the cathode surface, is systematically investigated. Typically, AIBs with sodium alginate (Na&#8722;Alg) as binder exhibit outstanding electrochemical performance in terms of specific capacity, rate capability, and cycling stability.







Abstract
The incompatibility of poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) with acidic ionic liquid electrolytes and the use of toxic and high&#8208;cost N&#8208;methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) solvents hinder the wide application of aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs). In this work, sodium alginate (Na&#8722;Alg) is developed as an aqueous binder for the fabrication of graphite positive electrodes in AIBs. The compatibility of various binders with the ionic liquid electrolyte is evaluated, and interaction between various binders and graphite particles before and after cycling is compared and discussed. The results demonstrate that the well compatibility of Na&#8722;Alg in ionic liquids and its reasonable distribution on the graphite surface facilitate fast charge transfer and ion diffusion, reduce electrode polarization, and thus contributing to significantly improved cycling stability and rate capability of AIBs. This work provides a new insight into the development of low&#8208;cost, eco&#8208;friendly, and high&#8208;performance binders for AIBs.

         <title>C versus O Protonation in Zincate Anions: A Simple Gas&#8208;Phase Model for the Surprising Kinetic Stability of Organometallics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Why do organozinc reagents survive instantaneous protolysis in protic media? A gas&#8208;phase model shows that the protonation of the organyl group, although thermodynamically strongly favored, is outcompeted by the protonation of a hydroxy ligand.







Abstract
For better understanding the intrinsic reactivity of organozinc reagents, we have examined the protolysis of the isolated zincate ions Et3Zn&#8722;, Et2Zn(OH)&#8722;, and Et2Zn(OH)2Li&#8722; by 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethanol in the gas phase. The protonation of the hydroxy groups and the release of water proceed much more efficiently than the protonation of the ethyl groups and the liberation of ethane. Quantum&#8208;chemical computations and statistical&#8208;rate theory calculations fully reproduce the experimental findings and attribute the lower reactivity of the more basic ethyl moiety to higher intrinsic barriers, which override the thermodynamic preference for its protonation. Thus, our minimalistic gas&#8208;phase model provides evidence for the intrinsically low reactivity of organozinc reagents toward proton donors and helps to explain their remarkable kinetic stability against moisture and even protic media.

         <title>C&#8722;H Bond Activation Relay (CHAR) of Proline Ester Derivatives Promoted by In Situ Triarylamine Radical Cation: Selective Synthesis of 4&#8208;Bromopyrrole Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A C&#8722;H activation relay (CHAR) of proline esters was realized by the in&#8197;situ generated tris(4&#8208;bromophenyl)amine radical cation, selectively constructing the skeleton of 4&#8208;bromopyrrole under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
Using the in&#8197;situ generated triarylamine radical cation as an initiator, the sp3 C&#8722;H bond of proline esters was smoothly oxidized and brominated through C&#8722;H activation relay (CHAR), giving a series of 4&#8208;bromopyrroles in good yields with high regioselectivity. The mechanistic study revealed that the oxidation of the active C&#8722;H bond initiated the followed 1,5&#8208;HAT and bromination, which provides a new method to realize the functionalization of the remote C&#8722;H bond.

         <title>Manipulation of Organic Afterglow in Fluoranthene&#8208;Containing Dopant&#8208;Matrix Systems: From Conventional Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence to Efficient Red TADF&#8208;Type Organic Afterglow</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the transformation from conventional room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence to efficient red TADF&#8208;type organic afterglow in fluoranthene&#8208;containing dopant&#8208;matrix systems. Red TADF&#8208;type afterglow materials with afterglow efficiency up to 13.1&#8201;% and afterglow lifetime of 0.1&#8197;s have been achieved, which paves the way for afterglow materials&#8217; applications in diverse areas.







Abstract
It remains challenging to fabricate highly&#8208;efficient and long&#8208;lived organic afterglow materials, especially in the case of red afterglow systems. Here we develop advanced charge transfer (CT) technology to boost afterglow efficiency and lifetimes in fluoranthene&#8208;containing dopant&#8208;matrix systems. First, organic CT molecules possess singlet&#8208;triplet splitting energy (&#916;EST) of around 0.5&#8197;eV, much smaller than localized excitation systems. Second, upon doping into suitable organic matrices, dipole&#8208;dipole interactions between 1CT states and organic matrices reduce 1CT levels with less effect on 3CT levels, and thus further narrow &#916;EST and enhance intersystem crossing. Third, the rigid planar structure of fluoranthene groups and the rigid microenvironment provided by organic matrices can suppress phosphorescence quenching. Forth, the multiple donor design enables spectral red&#8208;shifts to red region and switches on TADF mechanism to improve afterglow efficiency to 13.1&#8201;% and maintain afterglow lifetime of 0.1&#8197;s. Such high&#8208;performance afterglow materials have been rarely explored in reported studies.

         <title>Cooperative Rare&#8208;Earth/Lithium&#8208;Mediated Conversion of White Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>

Two heterometal polyphosphorus compounds with cyclo&#8208;P3 and norborane&#8208;P7 skeletons were formed by intramolecular cooperative yttrium hydride/LiPPh2 mediated activation of P4, while a pyramid&#8208;like P(PH)3 moiety was constructed from P4 functionalization using single metal specie (LY&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF)2(&#956;&#8208;H)2.







Abstract
The rare&#8208;earth/lithium cooperative effect on functionalization of white phosphorus has been investigated. The reaction of diazabutadiene&#8208;supported yttrium hydride chelated a LiPPh2 molecule (LY&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF)2(&#956;&#8208;H)2[&#956;&#8208;PPh2(Li)] (1, L=N,N&#8217;&#8208;di(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabutadiene) with P4 gave two novel mixed Y/Li multinuclear polyphosphorus complexes (LY&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF)2[cyclo&#8208;P3]Li(THF)3 (2) and [Li(THF)4]+[(LY&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF)3(norborane&#8208;P7)Li(THF)]&#8722; (3), accompanied with the elimination of diphosphorus compound Ph2PPPh2 (4) and H2. However, the comparative reaction of yttrium hydride (LY&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF)2(&#956;&#8208;H)2 with P4 afforded a trinuclear yttrium pyramid&#8208;P4 complex (LY&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF)3(&#956;3&#8208;P(PH)3) (5). Further investigations show that 5 cannot continuously react with LiPPh2 to form 2 and 3, and LiPPh2 reacted with P4 to form a Zintl&#8208;P7 lithium complex (TMEDA&#8901;Li)3(Zintl&#8208;P7) (6) and 4. These results indicated that the cooperation of Y/Li for activation of P4 is a key for the formation of 2 and 3. All new compounds have been characterized by NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies.

         <title>Zinc Substituted Myoglobin&#8722;Albumin Fusion Protein: A Photosensitizer for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Myoglobin combined with human serum albumin, Mb&#8208;HSA, was prepared using a yeast host cell with secretion into the culture medium. The heme of Mb&#8208;HSA was replaced with a zinc protoporphyrin IX, yielding ZnMb&#8208;HSA. This fluorescent fusion protein showed a superior activity of photodynamic cancer therapy in&#8197;vitro. Its blood circulation half&#8208;life was 11&#8208;fold longer than free ZnMb in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Myoglobin combined with human serum albumin (Mb&#8208;HSA) can be produced using yeast Pichia pastoris as a host strain, with secretion into the culture medium. This Mb&#8208;HSA fusion protein possesses identical O2 binding affinity to that of naked Mb. The Mb unit is reconstituted with a zinc(II) protoporphyrin IX, yielding (zinc substituted Mb)&#8208;HSA, ZnMb&#8208;HSA. The photophysical property and singlet O2 generation ability of ZnMb&#8208;HSA are equivalent to those of ZnMb. In vitro cell experiments revealed that ZnMb&#8208;HSA acts as a superior photosensitizer for photodynamic cancer therapy. It is noteworthy that ZnMb&#8208;HSA shows long circulation lifetime in&#8197;vivo.

Indirect oxidative dehydrogenation: Introduction of appropriate amount of Zn onto ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite resulted in highly dispersed and active site for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (C2H6) using CO2 as a milder oxidant (CO2&#8208;ODH), structure&#8208;performance relationship and reaction network were systematically investigated.







Abstract
Ethylene (C2H4) is a major chemical for the modern society, and new technologies for its production are of strategic importance globally. Recently, oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (C2H6) using CO2 as a milder oxidant (CO2&#8208;ODH) is proposed as a potential way for C2H4 production, and development of effective catalysts for the process is drawing wide attention. Here, we report on a facilely prepared ZSM&#8208;5 supported Zn system, i.&#8201;e., ZnZSM&#8208;5, which showed great promise in CO2&#8208;ODH. Samples with different Zn loadings were prepared and evaluated, and the highest performance was obtained over 0.05ZnZSM&#8208;5 at 700&#8201;&#176;C and a CO2:C2H6 feeding ratio of 5&#8201;:&#8201;1. During 340&#8197;min TOS, the C2H6 conversion decreased moderately from 36.2&#8201;% to 23.1&#8201;%, and the C2H4 yield stabilized at 21.9&#8201;% to 27.9&#8201;%. Based on systematic characterization and investigation of reaction conditions, the structure&#8208;performance relationship and reaction network were discussed in detail.

Recently, oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) using CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a milder oxidant (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-ODH) is proposed as a potential way for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; production, and development of effective catalysts for the process is drawing wide attention. Here, we report on a facilely prepared ZSM-5 supported Zn system, i.&#8201;e., ZnZSM-5, which showed great promise in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-ODH. Samples with different Zn loadings were prepared and evaluated, and the highest performance was obtained over 0.05ZnZSM-5 at 700&#8201;&#176;C and a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; feeding ratio of 5&#8201;:&#8201;1. During 340&#8197;min TOS, the C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; conversion decreased moderately from 36.2&#8201;% to 23.1&#8201;%, and the C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; yield stabilized at 21.9&#8201;% to 27.9&#8201;%. Based on systematic characterization and investigation of reaction conditions, the structure-performance relationship and reaction network were discussed in detail.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Across the Dimensions: A Three&#8208;Component Self&#8208;Assembly of Pentaphosphaferrocene&#8208;based Coordination Polymers</title>

Coordination polymers: The combination of the rigid, aromatic dinitrile isomers ortho/meta/para&#8208;(NC)2C6H4, the pentaphosphaferrocenes [CpRFe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (CpR=Cp*, Cp&#8217;&#8217;; Cp*=&#951;5&#8208;C5Me5; Cp&#8217;&#8217;=&#951;5&#8208;C5H3tBu2&#8208;1,3) with different steric demands and a silver salt with a non&#8208;coordinating anion SbF6&#8722; gives a unique view into how those building blocks can influence a three&#8208;component self&#8208;assembly system giving rise to various 1D/2D/3D&#8208;coordination polymers.







Abstract
Pentaphosphaferrocenes [CpRFe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (Cp*=&#951;5&#8208;C5Me5) (A), Cp&#8217;&#8217;=&#951;5&#8208;C5H3tBu2&#8208;1,3 (B)) are excellent building blocks for polymeric assemblies in supramolecular chemistry in combination with coinage metal salts of weakly coordinating anions such as AgSbF6. Adding rigid aromatic dinitriles ortho/meta/para&#8208;(NC)2C6H4 in a one&#8208;pot reaction between [CpRFe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] and AgSbF6 leads to various coordination polymers (CPs) by a three&#8208;component self&#8208;assembly. The sterical demand of the differently substituted cyclopentadiene ligands as well as the rigid constitution of the isomeric dinitriles (NC)2C6H4 play a key role in the formation of the isolated CPs. All CPs were characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

A modular synthetic strategy was developed to achieve zigzag&#8208;edged polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation from &#8220;U&#8208;shaped&#8221; benzo[m]tetraphene&#8208;based precursors. The experimental and theoretical investigations elucidated the edge&#8208; and size&#8208;dependent effect on the electronic structures and optical properties. Moreover, ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy disclosed the modulation of the photophysical properties upon &#960;&#8208;extension.







Abstract
A series of zigzag&#8208;edged polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (Z1&#8208;Z3) were synthesized from 2,12&#8208;dibromo&#8208;7,14&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;benzo[m]tetraphene (9) as a versatile building block. Their structures were unambiguously confirmed by laser desorption/ionization time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometry, 1H NMR, Raman, and Fourier&#8208;transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopies as well as scanning tunneling microscopy. The fingerprint vibrational modes were elucidated with theoretical support. The edge&#8208; and size&#8208;dependent optical properties were characterized by UV&#8208;Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Moreover, ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy revealed distinct modulation of the photophysical properties upon &#960;&#8208;extension from Z1 to Z2, the latter having a gulf edge.

         <title>Cyclic or Linear? Parameters Determining the Outcome of Glycine Polymerization in Silica Surface Prebiotic Scenarios</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic or linear? The parameters determining the outcome of glycine polymerization on silica surface are studied through monomers deposition from both gas and liquid phases. The results showed that the density of the nearly&#8208;free silanols NFS is a crucial parameter to predict the formation of linear or cyclic polymers when Gly is deposited from gas phase. For liquid phase deposition, Gly deposited in its zwitterionic form could isomerize to its neutral form and readsorb on the silanol&#8208;Gly esters to form linear peptides besides DKP.Please consider the following revised version of TOC







Abstract
The parameters that determine the formation of linear peptides and cyclic dimers (diketopiperazine, DKP) on silica surfaces of different surface area, silanol and siloxane ring populations, controlled by thermal treatments, are investigated upon glycine deposition from gas and liquid phases. The formed products were characterized by infrared and Raman spectroscopies, X&#8208;ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis. The results reveal the importance of &#8220;nearly&#8208;free&#8221; silanols to form ester centers as primers for the formation of linear peptides over DKP, on surfaces with medium silanol density (1.4 to 2.7&#8197;nm&#8722;2). Quenched reactivity is seen on isolated silanols (density&#8804;0.7&#8197;nm&#8722;2), while silanols involved in hydrogen bonding (density of 4.5&#8197;nm&#8722;2) weakly interact with Gly resulting in its cyclization to DKP. Deposition of glycine from liquid phase may also form both DKP and linear polymers, depending on its loading and silica surface. These conclusions demonstrate the complexity of glycine surface chemistry in the polymerization reaction and highlight the interest of a surface science approach to evaluate geochemical prebiotic scenarios.

         <title>Melt Castable Derivatives of Pentaerythritol Tetranitrate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Energetic materials: In this work, the pentaerythritol backbone was modified with amine, nitramine and tetrazole functionalities leading to powerful melt castable pentaerythritol tetranitrate derivatives that outperform TNT. Exciting insights into the influence of these functionalities on mechanical sensitivities and melting behavior are observed and discussed.







Abstract
In the search for high&#8208;performance and environmentally friendly energetic materials, the derivatization of known materials is an often&#8208;applied concept to fulfill modern&#8208;day demands. Surprisingly, the long know pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) has only been derivatized to a limited extent. PETN shows a brought application in energetic materials or pharmaceutics. In this work, the PETN backbone is modified by introducing nitramine, ionic nitramine, amine, ionic amine and tetrazole functionalities. The obtained and structurally similar compounds allow good comparability and insights into functional group effects on sensitivity, thermal behavior and performance. The functionalizations result in melting points in the range of 64 to 126&#8201;&#176;C. Some compounds are therefore potential candidates to replace toxic TNT.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Energetic materials&lt;/b&gt;: In this work, the pentaerythritol backbone was modified with amine, nitramine and tetrazole functionalities leading to powerful melt castable pentaerythritol tetranitrate derivatives that outperform TNT. Exciting insights into the influence of these functionalities on mechanical sensitivities and melting behavior are observed and discussed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the search for high-performance and environmentally friendly energetic materials, the derivatization of known materials is an often-applied concept to fulfill modern-day demands. Surprisingly, the long know pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) has only been derivatized to a limited extent. PETN shows a brought application in energetic materials or pharmaceutics. In this work, the PETN backbone is modified by introducing nitramine, ionic nitramine, amine, ionic amine and tetrazole functionalities. The obtained and structurally similar compounds allow good comparability and insights into functional group effects on sensitivity, thermal behavior and performance. The functionalizations result in melting points in the range of 64 to 126&#8201;&#176;C. Some compounds are therefore potential candidates to replace toxic TNT.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polarity&#8208;Evolution Control and Luminescence Regulation in Multiple&#8208;Site Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solvent&#8208;polarity effect on the framework/luminescence regulation was demonstrated based on the multiple&#8208;site hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks: distinct electrostatic forces controlled by solvent polarities (high/low) would benefit for the different framework (cage/channel) structures; the solvent polarity could further adjust the conformation of organic building unit to generate a broadband tunable luminescence.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) have shown great potential in separation, sensing and host&#8208;guest chemistry, however, the pre&#8208;design of HOFs remains challenging due to the uncertainty of solvents&#8242; participation in framework formation. Herein, the polarity&#8208;evolution&#8208;controlled framework/luminescence regulation is demonstrated based on multiple&#8208;site hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks. Several distinct HOFs were prepared by changing bonding modes of building units via the evolution of electrostatic forces induced by various solvent polarities. High&#8208;polar solvents with strong electrostatic attraction to surrounding units showed the tendency to form cage structures, while low&#8208;polar solvents with weak electrostatic attraction only occupy hydrogen&#8208;bond sites, conducive to the channel formation. Furthermore, the conformation of optical building unit can be adjusted by affecting the solvent polarity, generating different luminescence outputs. These results pave the way for the rational design of ideal HOFs with on&#8208;demand framework regulation and luminescence properties.

         <title>Enabling Long&#8208;Lived Polymeric Room Temperature Phosphorescence Material in Abominable Solvent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient long&#8208;lived polymeric room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent material was achieved based on the rigid structure provided by aromatic and piperidine rings of mBPipQ and the dense molecular arrangement of an epoxy resin, which stabilized triplet excitons. More importantly, these materials exhibit stable yellow&#8208;green phosphorescence emission after being immersed in strong acid or alkali solutions for 10&#8197;days.







Abstract
Long&#8208;lived polymeric room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have drawn more attention due to their convenient preparation process and equally efficient phosphorescence performance in recent years. As the polymer matrix is sensitive to air and humidity, some non&#8208;covalent interactions in the matrix are easily decomposed in water or air, which means that it is difficult for this material to be stored stably for a long time in the atmospheric environment or under harsh conditions. In this work, polymer powder mBPipQ contains aromatic and piperidine rings that are designed and synthesized successfully. Then the polymer is uniformly dispersed into epoxy resin matrix to form long&#8208;lived polymeric RTP material with efficient afterglow properties. The stiff backbone structure of mBPip and dense molecular arrangement of epoxy resin provide a rigid environment to stabilize triplet excitons, the RTP performance is greatly enhanced. The lifetime of mBPipQ in epoxy resin is 2&#8197;times higher than that of small molecule chromophore in that one. Interestingly, after soaking in strong acid or alkali solution for 10&#8197;days, the material can still emit stable and efficient long&#8208;lived phosphorescence. It is thanks to the hard matrix after full curing, which can provide a protective layer to prevent external quenchers from interfering with phosphorescence emission. Utilizing the efficient phosphorescence emission and excellent abominable&#8208;solvent resistance of this RTP material, multilevel information encryption has been successfully demonstrated. This work broadens the application scope of polymeric RTP materials in harsh environments and provides a new idea for achieving efficient RTP emission.

         <title>Facile One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Polysubstituted Pyridinium Salts by Annulation of Enamines with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and facile synthesis of highly substituted pyridinium salts through annulation of enamines with alkynes is reported. The keys to this advancement are: 1) one&#8208;pot, mild reaction conditions; 2) broad substrate scope; and 3) selective 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization.







Abstract
An efficient and facile synthesis of highly substituted pyridinium salts through the annulation of enamines with alkynes is reported herein. A Ag2CO3/HNTf2 synergistically acting catalyst system was developed and used in a condensation reaction between carbonyl substrates and propargylamine to afford structurally diverse pyridinium salts. A mechanistic investigation shows that this one&#8208;pot transformation proceeded via selective 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization of the in situ generated propargylenamine and protonolysis of the resulting vinyl&#8211;silver intermediate. The reaction conditions are mild, and the substrate scope is broad. During the cyclization, an unusual inversion of the normal reactivity of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl systems was observed.

         <title>Copper (I) Chloride&#8208;Catalyzed Photoredox Synthesis of Multifunctionalized Compounds at Room Temperature and Their Antifungal Activities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and highly efficient copper photoredox&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component coupling of BQ, alkyl/aryl alcohols, and alkyl/aryl terminal/internal alkynes forms highly functionalized products at room temperature. The late&#8208;stage functionalized compounds show good anti&#8208;Candida krusei and anti&#8208;Candida glabrata activities with lower cytotoxicities than that of fluconazole, the standard antifungal medicine.







Abstract
A simple visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced CuCl&#8208;catalyzed synthesis was developed for highly functionalized carbon&#8208;centered compounds (&#945;&#8208;alk/aryloxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diaryl/alkylaryl&#8208;acetaldehydes/ketones) at room temperature using benzoquinone, alkyl/aryl alcohol, and alkyl/aryl terminal/internal alkynes. Late&#8208;stage functionalized compounds show good antifungal activities, especially against Candida krusei fungal strain, in in&#8197;vitro experiments (the Broth microdilution method). Moreover, toxicity tests (zebrafish egg model experiments) indicated that these compounds had negligible cytotoxicity. The green chemistry metrics (E&#8208;factor value is 7.3) and eco&#8208;scale (eco&#8208;scale value is 58.8) evaluations show that the method is simple, mild, highly efficient, eco&#8208;friendly, and environmentally feasible.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cuprous (I) ions coordinated polymer was synthesized via the coordination of phenylthiourea grafted dendrimer with either cuprous&#8197;(I) ions or copper&#8197;(II) ions, since the copper&#8197;(II) ions in the coordination polymer was reduced to cuprous&#8197;(I) ions. The coordinated polymer facilitates the protein binding, cellular uptake and endosomal escape, and thus enables efficient protein delivery.







Abstract
Intracellular protein delivery has attracted considerable attention in the development of protein&#8208;based therapeutics, however, the design of highly efficient materials for robust delivery of native proteins remains challenging. This study proposes a Cu+ &#8208;based coordination polymer for cytosolic protein delivery with high efficacy and robustness. The phenylthiourea grafted dendrimer is coordinated with cuprous ions to prepare the polymeric carrier, which efficiently bind cargo proteins via a combination of coordination, ionic and hydrophobic interactions. The incorporation of Cu+ ions in the polymer greatly improves its cellular uptake and endosomal escape. The cuprous&#8208;based coordination polymer successfully delivered a variety of structurally diverse proteins into various cell lines with reserved bioactivities. This study provides a new type of coordination polymers for cytosolic delivery of biomacromolecules.

         <title>Divergent Construction of N&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons with Indole as the Nitrogen Source Building Block</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal catalyst&#8208;dependent divergent cascade reaction of alkyne&#8208;embedded diazoketones with indoles is reported, which offers expeditious access to benzo[i]phenanthridines and benzo[b]carbazoles in good yield under mild reaction conditions. N&#8208;embedded dienophiles are used rather than alkynes or olefins for cycloaddition with the isobenzopyrylium species, providing a concise and practical approach for the selective construction of N&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with structural diversity and broad functional group compatibility.







Abstract
An Ag/Au&#8208;catalyzed divergent cascade reaction of alkyne embedded diazoketones with indoles has been described. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction goes through a [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of an in&#8197;situ formed isobenzopyrylium intermediate with indole, followed by a sequential retro&#8208;Michael addition/carbene N&#8722;H insertion process to give the benzo[i]phenanthridines products with gold catalysis; whereas a dearomatization/rearomatization sequence occurs favourably when the reaction is catalyzed by a silver catalyst, delivering benzo[b]carbazoles in generally high to excellent yields. Notably, this is a rare example of using indole as the dienophile for cycloaddition with the isobenzopyrylium species, providing a concise and practical approach for the selective construction of N&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with structural diversity and broad functional&#8208;group compatibility.

         <title>Orientational Control of Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Pyrene Clusters by Using a DNA Scaffold</title>

Not just any which way: Circularly polarized luminescence from a pyrene cluster in DNA duplexes has been systematically investigated. CPL properties varied depending not only on the distance but also on the relative orientation between two pyrene dimers.







Abstract
We have investigated the chiroptical activities of pyrene clusters incorporated within a DNA duplex. Three pyrene derivatives were prepared on d&#8208;threoninol linkers to allow incorporation within a DNA strand. DNA scaffolds containing dimers, tetramers, and hexamers of the pyrene derivatives were prepared. The homodimers of 1&#8208; and of 4&#8208;pyrenecarboxylic acid, but not 2&#8208;pyrenecarboxylic acid, emitted intense circularly polarized luminescence signals. Although increasing the number of pyrene units weakened the signal, insertion of natural base pairs between two dimers enhanced its intensity. Interestingly, circularly polarized luminescence intensities varied non&#8208;monotonically depending on the number of intervening base pairs, thus indicating the importance of orientation between pyrene dimers. The results presented here could lead to the development of bright circularly polarized luminescence materials and probes.

Circularly polarized luminescent (CPL) depends on orientation. The DNA helix is depicted as a spiral staircase on which chromophore people stand. The CPL intensity, which is shown as helical light, varies depending not only on the distance between chromophores but also on their relative orientation. Helical structures of DNA duplexes are also illustrated. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Kashida, H. Asanuma, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300182).

From diquat to dye&#8208;cat: More than just a herbicide, the reversibly reducible diquat moiety now harnesses the power of the sun. Incorporated into donor&#8211;acceptor dyes we developed, as well as into charge&#8211;transfer complexes we observed, diquat is enabled to absorb visible light. This allowed the use of these systems in the photocatalytic thiocyanation of various indoles and pyrroles, with air as the oxidant. More information can be found in the Research Article by R.

         <dc:description>
Cooperativity at the crossroad: The two copper centers in the dinuclear copper(II) dimethylglyoxime complex work in concert to facilitate ligand hydrolysis that yields butane&#8208;2,3&#8208;dione monoxime and NH2OH. The fate of NH2OH depends on the solvent used, in CH3CN, for example, NH2OH is oxidized to N2O yielding [Cu(CH3CN)4]+ as reduced species. In ethanol, however, NH2OH is reduced to NH4+, which in turn yields acetaldehyde as oxidized species. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Becker and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203438).

The fate of NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH depends on the solvent used, in CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN, for example, NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH is &lt;i&gt;oxidized&lt;/i&gt; to N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O yielding [Cu(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; as reduced species. In ethanol, however, NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH is &lt;i&gt;reduced&lt;/i&gt; to NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, which in turn yields acetaldehyde as oxidized species. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Becker and co-workers (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202203438"&gt;10.1002/chem.202203438&lt;/a&gt;).

         <title>Frontispiece: Light&#8208;triggered Modulation of Supramolecular Chirality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular chirality triggered by unpolarized light and circularly polarized light is systematically discussed. The unpolarized light triggered systems were mainly assisted by various photoactive components. Besides, circularly polarized light can directly induce the supramolecular charity in organic and inorganic systems or their hybridized systems. It is anticipated that this review can advance the development of more responsive chiral functional nanomaterials. For more details, see the Review by F. Yang, B. Yue, and L. Zhu (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203794).

Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) has attracted much interest due to its potential applications on chiral photonic techniques and optoelectronic materials science. Chiral supramolecular assembly processes can be accompanied by chirality transfer and induction mechanism, which can promote the amplification effect on the induced CPL of achiral dyes. More information can be found in the Review article by W. Zheng, Y. Cheng and co&#8208;workers. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202204039).

Light&#8208;triggered supramolecular chiral assemblies have aroused great attention. According to the different interaction ways between light and system, we mainly summarized non&#8208;polarized light and circularly polarized light (CP light) triggered chiral assemblies. Non&#8208;polarized light triggered systems were mainly assisted by the introduction of photoactive components. As a chiral light source, CP light can directly induce the asymmetric assembly of organic molecules and asymmetric photosynthesis of inorganic metal nanostructures. Besides, photoexcitation induced assembly based physical approach was also explored recently to regulate supramolecular chirality beyond photochemical reactions. Furthermore, many relevant functional applications were also presented.







Abstract
Dynamically controlling the supramolecular chirality is of great significance in development of functional chiral materials, which is thus essential for the specific function implementation. As an external energy input, light is remote and accurate for modulating chiral assemblies. In non&#8208;polarized light control, some photochemically reactive units (e.&#8201;g., azobenzene, &#593;&#8208;cyanostilbene, spiropyran, anthracene) or photo&#8208;induced directionally rotating molecular motors were designed to drive chiral transfer or amplification. Besides, photoexcitation induced assembly based physical approach was also explored recently to regulate supramolecular chirality beyond photochemical reactions. In addition, circularly polarized light was applied to induce asymmetric arrangement of organic molecules and asymmetric photochemical synthesis of inorganic metallic nanostructures, in which both wavelength and handedness of circularly polarized light have effects on the induced supramolecular chirality. Although light&#8208;triggered chiral assemblies have been widely applied in photoelectric materials, biomedical fields, soft actuator, chiral catalysis and chiral sensing, there is a lack of systematic review on this topic. In this review, we summarized the recent studies and perspectives in the constructions and applications of light&#8208;responsive chiral assembled systems, aiming to provide better knowledge for the development of multifunctional chiral nanomaterials.

Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) has attracted much interest due to its potential applications on chiral photonic techniques and optoelectronic materials science. As known, dissymmetry factor (gem) of CPL is one essential factor for evaluating the features of CPL&#8208;active materials. Much attention has focused on how to increase the gem value, which is one of the most important issues for CPL practical applications. Recently, more and more works have demonstrated that chiral supramolecular could provide the significant strategy to improve the gem value through the orderly helical superstructure of chiral building blocks. Normally, this kind of chiral supramolecular assembly process can be accompanied by chirality transfer and induction mechanism, which can promote the amplification effect on the induced CPL of achiral dyes. In this review, we fully summarized recent advances on the induced CPL&#8208;active materials of chiral supramolecular co&#8208;assemblies, their applications in circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) and current challenges.

         <title>Reversible Pressure&#8208;Magnetic Modulation in a Tetrathiafulvalene&#8208;Based Dyad Piezochromic Dysprosium Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The extreme sensitivity of trivalent lanthanide ions to crystal field variations led to the emergence of single&#8208;molecule magnetic switching under various stimuli. The use of pressure as an external stimulus instead of classic light irradiation, oxidation or any chemical reactions allows a fine tuning of the magnetic modulation. Here the well&#8208;known pure isotopically enriched [162Dy(tta)3(L)]&#8901;C6H14 ( 162Dy) Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet (SMM) (tta&#8208; = 2&#8208;2&#8208;thenoyltrifluoroacetonate and L = 4,5&#8208;bis(propylthio)&#8208;tetrathiafulvalene&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)benzimidazole&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridine) was experimentally investigated by single&#8208;crystal diffraction and squid magnetometry under high applied pressures. Both reversible piezochromic properties and pressure modulation of the SMM behavior were demonstrated and supported by ab initio calculations. The magnetic study of the diluted sample [162Dy0.05Y0.95(tta)3(L)]&#8901;C6H14 ( 162Dy@Y) indicated that variations in the electronic structure have both intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;molecular origins. Quantitative magnetic interpretation concludes to a deterioration of the Orbach process for the benefit of both Raman and QTM mechanisms under applied pressure.</dc:description>

         <title>Bromobenzene transforms lanthanoid pseudo&#8208;Grignard chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Divalent lanthanoid pseudo&#8208;Grignard reagents PhLnBr (Ln = Sm, Eu and Yb) can be easily prepared by the oxidative addition of bromobenzene (PhBr) with lanthanoid metals in tetrahydrofuran (THF). PhLnBr reacts with bulky N,N&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;di&#8208;isopropylphenyl) formamidine (DippFormH) to generate LnII complexes, namely [Ln(DippForm)Br(thf)3]2&#215;6thf&#160; (1; Sm, 2; Eu), and [Yb(DippForm)Br(thf)2]2&#215;2thf (3; Yb). Samarium and europium (in 1 and 2) are seven coordinate, whereas ytterbium (in 3) is six coordinate, and all are bromine&#8208;bridged dimers. When PhLnBr reacts with 3,5&#8208;diphenylpyrazole (Ph2pzH), both divalent (5; [Eu(Ph2pz)2(thf)4]) and trivalent (4 a; [Sm(Ph2pz)3(thf)3]&#215;3thf, 4b; [Sm(Ph2pz)3(dme)2]&#215;dme) complexes are obtained. In the monomeric compounds 4(a, b), samarium is nine coordinate but europium is eight coordinate in 5. The use of PhLnBr in this work transforms the outcomes from earlier reactions of PhLnI.</dc:description>

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage functionalization for the divergent synthesis of novel podophyllotoxin derivatives by rhodium catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A divergent synthesis of novel podophyllotoxin derivatives was here reported from simple and readily available starting materials via Late&#8208;Stage functionalization strategy by rhodium catalysis. This strategy utilizes the ketone and oxime in substrates as internal direacting groups and requires no external ligand or removable directing group. 75 podophyllotoxin derivatives have been obtained without any erosion of the enantiopurity, indicating the broad substrate scope of this method. Additionally, by using the newly developed strategy, 9aa can be prepared via sequential transformation, which exhibited excellent anticancer activity against eight cancer cell lines. In particularly, 9aa suppressed Hela cells with IC50 values of 74.5 nM, which provides a promising lead compound for future drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Electroreductive Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling of Aziridines and Aryl Bromides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, a nickela&#8208;electrocatalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of readily available aryl aziridines and aryl bromides under mild and sustainable electrochemical conditions to access synthetic useful &#946;&#8209;arylethylamines is developed. This protocol is characterized by its exquisite chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity, broad substrate scope and good functional group compatibility. Mechanistic studies confirmed that the regioselectivity and reactivity observed are a result of electro&#8208;induced ring&#8208;opening of aziridines under electroreductive conditions to generate a benzyl radical intermediate as the active species. Furthermore, this strategy also enables cross&#8208;coupling with CO2 to access &#946;&#8209;amino acids under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterogeneous Photocatalytic Hydrogenative Reactions Using Liquid Hydrogen Donors: Mechanisms, Catalysts Design, and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterogeneous photocatalysis is a promising approach for a wide range of hydrogenative reactions owing to the mild reaction conditions and the possibility of employing liquid hydrogen donors. Currently, the major interest is focused on the development of high performance photocatalyst materials and the expansion of reaction scope. An overview from a perspective of hydrogen donor and thus the related mechanistic understanding of the light&#8208;induced hydrogenative reactions is rare. Here, we have categorized the photocatalytic hydrogenative reactions by the type of employed liquid hydrogen donors (hydrocarbons and water), discussed the basic criteria of hydrogen abstraction from these donors, and elaborated the design strategy of the photocatalyst materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Steric Effects on the Chelation of Mn2+ and Zn2+ by Hexadentate Polyimidazole Ligands: Modeling Metal Binding by Calprotectin Site 2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, there has been increasing interest in the design of ligands that bind Mn2+ with high affinity and selectivity, but this remains a difficult challenge. It has been proposed that the cavity size of the binding pocket is a critical factor in most synthetic and biological examples of selective Mn2+ binding. Here, we use a bioinspired approach adapted from the hexahistidine binding site of the manganese&#8208;sequestering protein calprotectin to systematically study the effect of cavity size on Mn2+ and Zn2+ binding. We have designed a hexadentate, trisimidazole ligand whose cavity size can be tuned through peripheral modification of the steric bulk of the imidazole substituents. Conformational dynamics and redox potentials of the complexes are dependent on ligand steric bulk. Stability constants are consistent with the hypothesis that larger ligand cavities are relatively favorable for Mn2+ over Zn2+, but this effect alone may not be sufficient to achieve Mn2+ selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>A pH&#8208; and Metal&#8208;Actuated Molecular Shuttle in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structure of the Viologen&#8208;Phenylene&#8208;Imidazole (VPI) guest, previously shown to be bound by cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) with binding modes depending on pH and silver ions, has been extended by adding hydrophobic groups on the two extremities of VPI before investigations of CB[7] binding by NMR, ITC, X&#8208;ray diffraction, UV&#8208;vis and fluorescence spectroscopies. With an imidazole station extended by a naphthalene group (VPI&#8208;N), binding modes of CB[7] are similar to those previously observed. However, with the viologen extended by a tolyl group (T&#8208;VPI), CB[7] preferentially sits on station T, shuttling between the T and P stations at acid pH or after Ag+ addition. The CB[7]&#8226;T&#8208;VPI complex thus behaves as a metal&#8208;actuated thermodynamic stop&#8208;and&#8208;go molecular shuttle featured by fast and autonomous ring translocation between two stations and a continuum for fractional station occupancy solely and easily controlled by Ag+ concentration.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antibacterial photodynamic therapy (APDT) has received considerable attention owing to its superiority. ZIF&#8208;8 was used to address the poor stability of the photosensitizer Rose Bengal (RB) encapsulation to synthesize RB@ZIF&#8208;8 NPs, which were doped into a composite film with poly (&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) (PCL) and polyvinyl alcohol&#8208;quaternary ammonium chitosan (PVA&#8208;QCS) as substrates to form composite films (PQZ). The composite films exhibited excellent photodynamic sterilization and good resistance to bacterial adhesion. The tensile strength of the film increased to 43.4 MPa, which was approximately 1.8 times that of the PCL film. With the addition of SiO2 and RB@ZIF&#8208;8 NPs, the film exhibited water repellency and UV&#8208;blocking properties. RAW264.7 cells were selected using the MTT method to confirm that the composite film had excellent biocompatibility and had no significant inhibitory effect on cell growth and reproduction. PQZ multifunctional composite films show potential as novel APDT antimicrobial materials for food packaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Defluorination of fluorophenols by a nonheme iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species: observation of a new intermediate along the reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;valent iron(IV)&#8208;oxo intermediates are versatile oxidants in the biotransformation of various substrates by metalloenzymes and catalyze essential reactions for human health but also in the biodegradation of toxic organic pollutants in the environment. Herein, we report a biomimetic system that efficiently reacts with fluorophenols through defluorination reactions and trap and characterize various short&#8208;lived intermediates along the reaction mechanism. We present the synthesis and characterization of a nonheme iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species and study its reactivity patterns with a series of trihalophenols (X = F, Cl, Br). A combined experimental and computational study reveals that the oxidative dehalogenation of 2,4,6&#8208;trifluorophenol is initiated with an H&#8208;atom abstraction from the phenolic group by the iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species resulting in the formation of a phenolate radical and an iron(III)&#8208;hydroxo species. This iron(III)&#8208;hydroxo species forms an adduct with the oxidized substrate with lmax at 558 nm which subsequently decays to give quinones as products.</dc:description>

         <title>Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Photochemical C&#8208;N Coupling of Amides with (Hetero)aryl  Chlorides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper reports a photochemical C&#8208;N coupling of abundant, but less reactive aryl chlorides, with structurally diverse primary and secondary amides by Ni&#8208;mediated without an external photocatalyst. Under the irradiation of light (390&#8208;395 nm) with a soluble organic amine as the base, the reaction allows for the successful transformation of (hetero)aryl chlorides to a wide range of N&#8208;aryl amides. More than 60 examples are shown, demonstrating the feasibility and applicability of this protocol in organic synthesis. Mechanic studies indicate that this amidation proceeds via a Ni(I)&#8208;Ni(III) catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>The Impact of the Solvent Dielectric Constant on A&#8592; NH3 Dative Bond Depends on the Nature of the Lewis Electron&#8208;Pair Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The present work aims to determine to what extent the value of the dielectric constant of the solvent can influence the dative bond in Lewis electron pair bonding systems. For this purpose, two different systems, namely H3B&#172;NH3 and {Zn&#172;(NH3)}2+, were studied in selected solvents with significantly different dielectric constants. Based on the results resulting from state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art computational methods using DFT, constrained DFT, energy decomposition analyses, solvent accessible surface area, and charge transfer calculations, we found that the stability of the neutral H3B&#172;NH3 system increases with increasing solvent polarity. In contrast, the opposite trend is observed for the positively charged {Zn&#172;(NH3)}2+. The observed changes are attributed to different charge redistributions in neutral and charged complexes, which are reflected by a different response to the solvent and are quantified by changes in solvation energies.</dc:description>

         <title>A Common C2&#8208;Symmetric 2,2&#8242;&#8208;Biphenol Building Block and its Application in the Synthesis of (+)&#8208;di&#8208;epi&#8208;Gonytolide A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A variety of biaryl polyketides exhibit remarkable bioactivities. However, their synthetic accessibility is often challenging. Herein, the enantioselective preparation and synthetic application of an axially chiral 2,2&#8242;&#8208;biphenol building block is outlined that represents a common motif of these intriguing natural products. Based on the highly regioselective and scalable bromination of a phenol precursor, a coupling process by Lipshutz cuprate oxidation was developed. A copper&#8208;mediated deracemization strategy proved to be superior to derivatization or kinetic resolution approaches. Key steps in the overall building block synthesis were rationalized through DFT&#8208;studies. Utilizing the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;biphenol, a highly diastereoselective five step synthesis of formerly unknown (+)&#8209;di&#8208;epi&#8208;gonytolide A was developed, thus showcasing the building block&#8217;s general potential for the synthesis of natural products and their derivatives. En route, the first enantioselective construction of a chromone dimer intermediate was established.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperative Supramolecular Polymerization of Triphenylamine bis&#8208;Urea Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we probe the hydrogen bond&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of a triphenylamine (TPA) bis&#8208;urea macrocycle in the presence and absence of guests. Comprised of methylene urea&#8208;bridged TPAs with exterior tridodecyloxy benzene solubilizing groups, the macrocycle exhibits concentration&#8208;dependent aggregate formation in THF and H2O/THF mixtures as characterized by&#160;1H NMR and DOSY experiments. Its assembly processes were further probed by temperature&#8208;dependent UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy. Upon heating, UV/Vis spectra exhibit a hypsochromic shift in the&#160;&#955;max, while fluorescence spectra show an increase in emission intensity. Conversely, the protected macrocycle that lacks hydrogen bond donors demonstrates no significant change. Thermodynamic analysis indicates a cooperative self&#8208;assembly pathway with distinct nucleation and elongation regimes. The morphology and structure of the aggregate were elucidated by dynamic light scattering, atomic force microscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Variable temperature emission spectra were utilized to monitor the impact of guests, such as diphenylacetylene, that can be bound in the columnar channels. The findings suggest that the elongation of assemblies is influenced by the presence of these guests. In comparison, diphenyl sulfoxide, likely functioning as a chain stopper, limited the assembly size.&#160;&#160;These studies suggest that judicious selection of (co)monomers may modulate the function and utility of these supramolecular systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating the Shape of Short Metal&#8208;Mediated Heteroleptic Tapes of Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In view of developing artificial light&#8208;responsive complex systems, the preparation of discrete and robust heteroleptic assemblies of different chromophores in precisely defined positions is of great value since they would allow to investigate directional processes unavailable in symmetrical architectures. Here we describe the preparation, through a modular stepwise approach, and characterization of four novel and robust metal&#8208;mediated heteroleptic 4+3 porphyrin tapes, labeled D4&#8208;T4&#8208;D4, D3&#8208;T4&#8208;D3, D4&#8208;T3&#8208;D4 , and D3&#8208;T3&#8208;D3, where a central meso&#8208;tetrapyridylporphyrin (either 3'&#8208;TPyP = T3or 4'&#8208;TPyP = T4) is connected to two equal cis&#8208;dipyridylporphyrins (either 3&#8242;cisDPyMP = D3 or 4&#8242;cisDPyMP = D4) through four {t,c,c&#8208;RuCl2(CO)2} fragments. Whereas D4&#8208;T4&#8208;D4 is flat, the tapes containing at least one 3&#8242;PyP, i.e. D3&#8208;T4&#8208;D3, D4&#8208;T3&#8208;D4, and D3&#8208;T3&#8208;D3, have unprecedented &#8211; and well defined &#8211; 3D geometries, and each exists in solution as a pair of stereoisomers in slow conformational equilibrium. The X&#8208;ray molecular structures of two such conformers, the C&#8208;shaped (D3&#8208;T4&#8208;D3)C and the z&#8208;shaped (D4&#8208;T3&#8208;D4)z, were determined and are fully consistent with the solution NMR findings.</dc:description>
