         <title>Coverage&#8208; and Temperature&#8208;Dependent Rates of Metalation, Ring Fusion and Polymerization of Benzoporphyrins on Cu(111)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using scanning&#8208;tunneling microscopy (STM), temperature&#8208;programmed desorption (TPD), X&#8208;ray photo&#173;electron spectroscopy (XPS) and density&#8208;functional theory (DFT), we have investigated metalation, ring fusion and polymerization of three different benzoporphyrins, tetraphenyl&#173;trans&#173;disbenzoporphyrin (2&#8208;Benzo), copper&#8208;tetraphenyltransdibenzo&#173;porphy&#173;rin (Cu 2&#8208;Benzo) and tetra&#173;phenyl&#173;&#173;tetra&#173;benzo&#173;porphyrin (4&#8208;Benzo), from 280 to 1000 K on Cu(111), and compare with previous data of tetraphenylporphyrin (0&#8208;Benzo) on Cu(111).
Using STM, we observe 2&#8208;Benzo to adsorb as individual, rather&#8208;immobile molecules at room tempe&#173;rature, which coalesce into elongated islands of metalated molecules at 373 K. N 1s XPS spectra confirm the metalation, and DFT&#8208;calculated structures and simulated STM images confirm the appearance in STM. Upon further heating to 398 K, the islands become rough and irregularly shaped, before completely dissolving at 423 K, most likely related to intramolecular ring fusion. Heating to 950 K leads to complete polymerization and a rough structure on the surface.
Using H2 TPD, we follow the coverage&#8208;dependent rates of metalation, ring fusion and polymerization for all four molecules. The metalation rate is found to correlate with, sometimes abrupt, changes in the adsorption structures, whereas the rates of ring fusion and polymerization decrease gradually with increasing coverage, for all molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Accessing Single&#8208;Molecule Properties of Heptacene Using a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acenes, classic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons composed of linearly fused benzene rings, represent a model system for exploring the physical properties of one&#8208;dimensional &#960;&#8208;conjugated structures. Isolating individual molecules at the single&#8208;molecule level provides a means to investigate their intrinsic properties, which is typically done by dissolving in solutions. However, this approach becomes increasingly difficult to apply for higher acenes owing to their high insolubility and instability. Thus, the electronic structure of higher acenes has long been a subject of intense discussion. This paper introduces a method to encapsulate heptacene within a metal&#8208;organic framework through in situ photochemical conversion of a precursor molecule. The transformation reaction of the precursor is significantly accelerated upon inclusion. This approach stabilizes otherwise unstable heptacene by suppressing undesirable side reactions through the spatial constraint. The bulk production of heptacene in an isolated state enables its exploration through various analytical techniques, providing insights into its single&#8208;molecule properties and leading to the first observation of its fluorescence. Moreover, experimental and theoretical studies reveal the electronic ground state of pristine heptacene.</dc:description>

         <title>Competition between Photoswitching and Fluorescence in Hemiindigos and Hemithioindigos</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of functionalized HIs and hemithioindigos (HTIs) were synthesized and studied for their potential applications as IFPSs. The investigation revealed that ortho&#8208;OH&#8208;substituted derivatives exhibit high fluorescence quantum yields while concurrently retaining significant photoswitching capabilities, high photostability, and fast recovery.








Abstract
Intrinsically fluorescent photoswitches (IFPSs) are crucial for super&#8208;resolution microscopy techniques. This study explores the impact of substituents on fluorescence and photoswitching efficiency in hemiindigos (HIs) and hemithioindigos. A series of functionalized derivatives &#160;was synthesized by one&#8208;step Knoevenagel condensations using a sustainable mechanochemical approach and characterized across various environments. Ortho&#8208;OH&#8208;substituted hemiindigo derivatives exhibited high fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;FL&#160;=&#160;0.65) while retaining significant photoswitching capabilities (&#934;Z&#8594;E&#160;=&#160;0.29 in THF) and fast recovery. These enhanced properties are attributed to the &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;donating characteristics of the OH substituents and the presence of intramolecular hydrogen bonds. The results of CC2 ab initio calculations revealed a detailed photoswitching mechanism: (1) initial population of the fluorescent &#960;&#960;* singlet excited state minimum, (2) subsequent elongation of the C&#9552;O bond leading to depopulation of the &#960;&#960;* state to the n&#960;* excited state minimum, (3) twisting of the double bond within the n&#960;* state, and (4) relaxation to the ground electronic state via a conical intersection. The analysis of the potential&#8208;energy surfaces modulated by EDG substituents, both in the &#960;&#960;* and n&#960;* excited states, provides insights into the structure&#8208;property relationships of IFPSs, guiding future rational design.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Photochemistry in Resonant Acoustic Mixers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bringing light to solid&#8208;state photochemistry &#8211; We introduce the first photochemical reaction using a resonant acoustic mixer (RAM), eliminating the need for milling media. This innovative, solvent&#8208;free approach enables scalable photochemistry under UVC light. Therefore, we designed and compared two custom&#8208;made photoreactors, paving the way for greener, more efficient photochemical reactions.








Abstract
Herein, we developed the first photochemical reaction set&#8208;up under solid&#8208;state conditions using a resonant acoustic mixer (RAM), a novel mechanochemical methodology that eliminates the need for milling media. This innovation outscores previous approaches in the ball mill under avoidance of milling balls and their related disadvantages. Further, it enables the facile performance and upscaling of photochemical reactions up to a factor of 10. We investigate the influences of liquid and solid additives on the rheology and performance of two model reactions and demonstrate and compare the efficiency and applicability of two custom&#8208;designed photoreactors.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Stabilized Bisacylgermylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a metal&#8208;free strategy for acyl group abstraction, enabling access to novel germenolates 2a,b, or NHC&#8208;stabilized bisacylgermylenes 4a,b. This novel class of germylenes exhibit nucleophilic reactivity toward iron and boron electrophiles, and can alternatively be prepared by the reaction of dichlorobisacylgermane and geminal bisgermenolate at low temperature.








Abstract
In this contribution, a metal&#8208;free synthetic approach toward isolable bisacylgermylenes, a novel class of germylenes, is described. Starting from tetra(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzoyl)germane 1 and bromo&#8208;tris(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzoyl)germane 3, we demonstrate that simple treatment with NHCs leads to two distinct types of reactivity: acyl abstraction and germylene stabilization. Reaction of 1 with NHCs produces imidazolium&#8208;substituted germenolates 2a,b via a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mechanism. In contrast, compound 3 undergoes stepwise substitution to afford isolable NHC&#8208;stabilized bisacylgermylenes 4a,b, which were structurally characterized by NMR and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The UV/Vis spectra of 4a,b show two absorption bands in the visible region of the light, which do not overlap and have different characters. Reactivity studies revealed its nucleophilic character and resulted in the formation of several germylene/iron and germylene/boron complexes. The removal of the NHC at room temperature with triphenylborane leads to a degradation, mainly based on the instability of the unstabilized bisacylgermylene. To determine its reactivity, an alternative synthetic strategy was developed based on the reaction of the geminal bisgermenolates 7 with the bischloro&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzoyl)&#8208;germane 9. Trapping reactions with NHCs results in the formation of 4a,b in near quantitative yields. This work expands the synthetic scope of main group low&#8208;valent chemistry and introduces germylenes with tunable reactivity.

&lt;p&gt;We developed a metal-free strategy for acyl group abstraction, enabling access to novel germenolates &lt;b&gt;2a&lt;/b&gt;,&lt;b&gt;b,&lt;/b&gt; or NHC-stabilized bisacylgermylenes &lt;b&gt;4a,b&lt;/b&gt;. This novel class of germylenes exhibit nucleophilic reactivity toward iron and boron electrophiles, and can alternatively be prepared by the reaction of dichlorobisacylgermane and geminal bisgermenolate at low temperature.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this contribution, a metal-free synthetic approach toward isolable bisacylgermylenes, a novel class of germylenes, is described. Starting from tetra(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)germane &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and bromo-tris(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)germane &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;, we demonstrate that simple treatment with NHCs leads to two distinct types of reactivity: acyl abstraction and germylene stabilization. Reaction of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; with NHCs produces imidazolium-substituted germenolates &lt;b&gt;2a&lt;/b&gt;,&lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt; via a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mechanism. In contrast, compound &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; undergoes stepwise substitution to afford isolable NHC-stabilized bisacylgermylenes &lt;b&gt;4a&lt;/b&gt;,&lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;, which were structurally characterized by NMR and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The UV/Vis spectra of &lt;b&gt;4a&lt;/b&gt;,&lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt; show two absorption bands in the visible region of the light, which do not overlap and have different characters.

         <title>A Shape&#8208;Complementarity Approach to Inducing Short Au(III)&#183;&#183;&#183;Au(III) Contacts in Tetracyanoaurate(III) Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a series of tetracyanoaurate(III) salts, careful consideration of cation shape &#8212; with the goal of shape&#8208;complementary crystal packing &#8212; can allow for the assembly of [Au(CN)4]&#8722; anions to be controlled, and in some cases Au(III)&#183;&#183;&#183;Au(III) aurophilic interactions to be rationally accessed.








Abstract
Six sets of tetracyanoaurate(III) salts were synthesized and structurally characterized using the metal&#8208;ligand complex cations [RE(bipyO2)4]3+ (RE&#160;=&#160;Sc, Y, La; bipyO2&#160;=&#160;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;N,N&#8217;&#8208;dioxide), [Fe(bipyO2)3]3+, [Ln(dmbipyO2)4]3+ (Ln&#160;=&#160;Ce, Eu, Yb; dmbipyO2&#160;=&#160;4,4&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;N,N&#8217;&#8208;dioxide), [Ca(tcmc)]2+ (tcmc&#160;=&#160;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetrakis&#8208;(carbamoylmethyl)&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane), and [Ca(12&#8208;crown&#8208;4)2]2+. Noncovalent assembly of the [Au(CN)4]&#8722; anions tended to occur via Au&#183;&#183;&#183;Ncyano interactions; however, rare Au(III)&#183;&#183;&#183;Au(III) contacts between the [Au(CN)4]&#8722; groups &#8212; suggesting aurophilicity &#8212; could be induced when certain cation shape requirements were met. Specifically, cations with shape, size, and symmetry that allowed for packing in a complementary fashion with Au(III)&#183;&#183;&#183;Au(III) aligned [Au(CN)4]&#8722; dimers or trimers &#8212; providing efficiently close&#8208;packed layers &#8212; were found to be sufficient for manifesting Au(III)&#183;&#183;&#183;Au(III) contacts. Modifying the [RE(bipyO2)4]3+ cation with peripheral methyl groups (the [Ln(dmbipyO2)4]3+ cation) caused isoreticular replacement of a {[Au(CN)4]3}3&#8722; trimer with a dumbbell&#8208;shaped {[Au(CN)4]2Cl}3&#8722; tri&#8208;anion featuring an unusual Au&#183;&#183;&#183;Cl&#183;&#183;&#183;Au bridge &#8212; illustrating that the assembly of the anionic groups will adapt to conserve the same close packing. Au(III) aurophilicity between the [Au(CN)4]&#8722; groups was studied using computational methods, crystal packing of the structures was probed using Hirshfeld surface analysis, and the emission properties of compounds containing the [Eu(dmbipyO2)4]3+ luminophore were investigated, showing high quantum yields of ca. 50%.

         <title>Fine&#8208;tuning the Photochemistry of Sulfur&#8208;Based Linkages with Ruthenium(II) Polypyridyl Complexes for Optimal PACT Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The thioether&#8208;based monodentate ligands are reported to be efficient photoreleased groups from Ru(II)&#8208;photocages designed for photoactivated chemotherapy (PACT). However, the direct comparison and systematic studies of the photochemical behavior of sulfur linkages of varied electronic/oxidation states, i.e., sulfoxides, thioethers, or thiols coordinated with Ru(II)&#8208;polypyridyls, remain unexplored. To delve into the intricate photophysics and photochemistry of Ru(II)&#8208;S linkages, two Ru(II)&#8208;polypyridyls: [Ru(ttpy)(phen)(DMSO)](PF6)2 [1](PF6)2, [Ru(ttpy)(phen)(DAS)](PF6)2 [2](PF6)2, [ttpy = 4&#8242;&#8208;tolyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8243;&#8208;terpyridine, phen = 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, DAS = diallyl sulfide, DMSO = dimethyl sulfoxide] were synthesized. Here, we used DMSO for the typical sulfoxide linkage, while DAS a biologically potent phytochemical, probed as a thioether linkage with Ru(II). The photosolvolysis monitored by UV&#8722;vis and 1H NMR studies with white LED in MeCN indicated slower substitution of DMSO than DAS. The water&#8208;soluble [1](NO3)2 and [2](NO3)2 exhibit facile photorelease of DAS than DMSO from {Ru(ttpy)(phen)}2+&#8208;photocages in water. The cytotoxicity and photocytotoxicity studies with HeLa and Caco2 cells show that [2](PF6)2 and [2](NO3)2 were more photocytotoxic with higher photoindices compared to [1](PF6)2 and [1](NO3)2. This apparently led to the conclusion that markedly facile photorelease of DAS resulted in higher photocytotoxicity of the DAS&#8208;based complexes. Therefore, thioether&#8208;based Ru(II)&#8208;polypyridyls portray better options for photocaging of prodrugs and PACT applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Phototherapies harness light&#8217;s spatial and temporal precision to noninvasively modulate biomolecular interactions, providing a powerful platform for precision oncology. This approach is particularly effective in targeting disease&#8208;associated molecular structures such as G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s), noncanonical nucleic acid conformations found in oncogene promoters and telomeres. These unique structures can impede DNA polymerase progression along the duplex, triggering DNA damage that ultimately compromises genomic stability. Stabilizing G4s with tailored ligands is currently being explored as a promising anticancer strategy, as it may induce toxic DNA damage specifically in rapidly dividing cancer cells. Unlike conventional G4 ligands, which remain continuously active, newly developed light&#8208;responsive molecules incorporate an OFF&#8211;ON switching mechanism that allows for spatiotemporal control over G4 dynamics and phototherapeutic effects. This concept article reviews a diverse array of light&#8208;responsive molecular tools, including photosensitizers (PSs), photocages, photochemically transformed ligands, and photoswitches, that selectively modulate G4&#8208;interactive binding properties, thereby laying the foundation for a versatile photopharmacological platform. Additionally, the article highlights recent advancements in this rapidly evolving field and discusses the challenges that remain for clinical translation, underscoring the significant potential of G4&#8208;targeted phototherapies to shape next&#8208;generation cancer treatments.</dc:description>

         <title>Cover Feature: Photocatalysis Enables Chemodivergent Radical Polar Crossover: Ritter&#8208;Type Amidation vs Heck&#8208;Type Olefin Carbofunctionalizations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 33, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature depicts a chemodivergent battle between a mounted knight (&#8220;Ritter&#8221; in German) wielding a mace and a foot soldier wielding a spear. Both warriors bear a shield inscribed with their respective radical polar crossover (RPC) intermediate following radical addition. The mace is phthalimide base from the redox active ester starting material that deprotonates diarylolefin&#8208;derived RPC intermediate to give a Heck product. The spear, reflecting a linear nitrile partner attacking styrene&#8208;derived RPC intermediate, is coated with acid that facilitates the Ritter process. More information can be found in the Research Article by J.&#160;P. Barham and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202500666). Image created by Sarah&#160;S. Coutts.

         <title>Cover Feature: Unlocking the Potential of Tris(Pentafluorophenyl)Borane in Reductive Desulfurization of Thioamides With Silane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 33, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A B(C&#8326;F&#8325;)&#8323;&#8208;catalyzed desulfurization of thioamides in the presence of phenyl silane has been investigated. Interestingly, thioamides can undergo reduction via two pathways, viz., desulfurization and deamination. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202500738), H.&#160;K. Kisan, A. Mukherjee and co&#8208;workers show that despite the possibilities of these two pathways, only one of them is operative selectively to provide the corresponding amines. In the same way, a car (thioamide) has the possibility to turn either right or left along the road; however, a policeman [B(C&#8326;F&#8325;)&#8323;] helps the car to go in the right directions (desulfurization) to avoid the closed road on the left side.

Abstract
Naphthalimide&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled materials have gained significant attention in recent years because of their exceptional versatility and wide range of applications, from sensors and electronics to biomedical. Naphthalimides derivatives, with ease of functionalization and robust photophysical properties, became an ideal platform for creating highly ordered self&#8208;assembled architectures with tailored functionalities. This review provides an overall understanding of the recent developments in the synthesis and self&#8208;assembly of naphthalimide&#8208;based materials, focusing on how self&#8208;assembly enhances their performance in various applications. The review examines the role of self&#8208;assembly in improving these materials&#8217; optical, mechanical, and electronic properties, highlighting their use in sensors for detecting gases, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and amines. Furthermore, the integration of self&#8208;assembled naphthalimides in light&#8208;emitting devices, energy&#8208;harvesting systems, and fluorescence&#8208;based imaging demonstrates their potential in both electronic and biological applications. By analyzing recent developments in molecular design, self&#8208;assembly strategies, and applications, this review aims to offer insights into how these materials can be optimized for future technological advancements.

         <title>Strategies for Developing Activity&#8208;Based Luminescent Probes for Imaging and Diagnosing Inflammatory Bowel Diseases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 33, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive analysis of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art molecular probes designed to target inflammatory bowel diseases&#8208;specific biomarkers, including oxidative stress mediators and enzymatic biomarkers. By elucidating these mechanisms, this review aims to enhance researchers' understanding and facilitate the future application of molecular probes for more effective IBD diagnosis and monitoring.








Abstract
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have experienced a concerning global increase in incidence over recent decades. The advent of molecular imaging probes has revolutionized real&#8208;time biomarker monitoring in IBD pathophysiology, enabling visualization of critical pathological processes. These probes provide dynamic insights into oxidative stress mediators (including reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species) and enzymatic biomarkers (e.g., caspase&#8208;1, pantetheinase, dipeptidyl peptidase IV, nitroreductase, elastase, myeloperoxidase, and carboxylesterase 2), which are crucial for understanding disease mechanisms. Despite significant technological advancements, there remains a lack of systematic analyses exploring the diagnostic potential and therapeutic monitoring applications of these molecular probes in IBD management. This review comprehensively analyzes the design of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art molecular probes targeting IBD&#8208;specific biomarkers, with particular focus on their detection mechanisms and biological applicability. Through a mechanistic elucidation of detection paradigms, this review aims to guide the development of future probes for diagnosing IBD.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Fixation of CO2 to Form N&#8208;Containing Heterocyclic Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 33, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the research progress of various typical N&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds in the past five years, detailing the catalytic performance and principles of promising catalysts. Finally, this pathway's development trends and characteristics are summarized and prospected.








Abstract
N&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds are common chemical structures in drugs, bioactive compounds, and natural products. Using CO2 as a C1 source for synthesizing N&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds aligns with the concepts of green chemistry and sustainability. In recent years, the synthesis of N&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds has been extensively and intensively studied. However, significant challenges remain, such as thermodynamic limitations, low catalytic efficiency, and harsh reaction conditions. Catalysts play an essential role in the catalytic activation of CO2 and/or substrates, thereby facilitating CO2 conversion. This review provides an overview of several typical N&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds converted from CO2, such as oxazolidinones, quinazoline&#8208;2,4(1H,3H)&#8208;diones, benzimidazoles, and benzimidazolones. The most recent catalysts used in these reactions are discussed, emphasizing their mechanistic roles in the reaction process.

&lt;p&gt;This review focuses on the research progress of various typical N-containing heterocyclic compounds in the past five years, detailing the catalytic performance and principles of promising catalysts. Finally, this pathway's development trends and characteristics are summarized and prospected.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N-containing heterocyclic compounds are common chemical structures in drugs, bioactive compounds, and natural products. Using CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a C1 source for synthesizing N-containing heterocyclic compounds aligns with the concepts of green chemistry and sustainability. In recent years, the synthesis of N-containing heterocyclic compounds has been extensively and intensively studied. However, significant challenges remain, such as thermodynamic limitations, low catalytic efficiency, and harsh reaction conditions. Catalysts play an essential role in the catalytic activation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and/or substrates, thereby facilitating CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion. This review provides an overview of several typical N-containing heterocyclic compounds converted from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, such as oxazolidinones, quinazoline-2,4(1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;,3&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;)-diones, benzimidazoles, and benzimidazolones. The most recent catalysts used in these reactions are discussed, emphasizing their mechanistic roles in the reaction process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strategy&#8208;Level Prodrug Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 33, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prodrug approaches can be expanded by increasing options for controlling site&#8208;selective functionalization, boosting the range of linking groups, and enhancing the chemoselectivity of reactive group incorporation. This Concept describes strategy&#8208;level prodrug synthesis, whereby these issues are addressed at an early stage of a sequence. New reactions that facilitate this approach and the biological results of the resulting products are highlighted.








Abstract
Organic synthesis uniquely provides opportunities to access molecules that serve defined purposes. Medicinal chemistry illustrates this attribute well with prodrug design, whereby a drug undergoes a late&#8208;stage conversion to a conditionally responsive active medicinal agent (AMA), being a notable example. Prodrugs are becoming increasingly important in medicinal chemistry but common approaches to introduce biologically responsive groups are limited in the chemoselectivity and scope of available functionalization reactions. This Concept article describes strategy&#8208;level prodrug synthesis, which is a powerful extension of classical prodrug formation that initiates sequences with the objective of introducing functionality early in a sequence to achieve greater scope, site&#8208;selectivity, and chemoselectivity for the incorporation of the biologically responsive group. Examples of functionalization using alkyne hydroamination, Curtius reaction, and alkene metathesis are highlighted along with the use of the prodrugs for biological applications.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Production Type Prussian Blue Analogues: A Family of Promising Hosts for High&#8208;Performance Multivalent&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 33, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, Wu and coworkers review the recent progress of entropy&#8208;enhanced Prussian blue analogues as one typical class of high&#8208;performance electrode for non&#8208;monovalent metal&#8208;ion batteries. The influence of introducing the entropy increase strategy in terms of structure and electrochemistry is introduced emphatically.








Abstract
The advancement of high&#8208;performance, safe, and cost&#8208;effective multivalent&#8208;ion batteries is pivotal for sustainable energy storage. Prussian blue analogs (PBAs), with their open framework and tunable redox&#8208;active sites, hold significant promise but face challenges in structural instability and sluggish ion diffusion. This review focuses on entropy production PBAs (EP&#8208;PBAs) for non&#8208;monovalent ion (Zn2+, Al3+, Mg2+, and Ca2+) battery systems. Incorporating multiple transition metals into PBAs leverages entropy production effects to stabilize crystal structures, enhance ion diffusion kinetics, and improve cycling stability. Synthesis methods such as coprecipitation, electrochemical deposition, and hydrothermal techniques are compared, with coprecipitation emerging as the most scalable approach. Entropy engineering mitigates lattice distortion, reduces defects, and suppresses phase transitions, enabling EP&#8208;PBAs to achieve high specific capacities and long&#8208;term stability. Challenges including interfacial instability and synthesis complexity are discussed, alongside future directions in material optimization, electrolyte compatibility, and scalable production. This work highlights the potential of entropy&#8208;stabilized PBAs as next&#8208;generation cathodes for multivalent&#8208;ion batteries, advancing sustainable energy storage technologies.

         <title>Hybrid Cyclopeptide&#8208;Based Chemical Models for Allosteric Disulfide and Amyloid Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 33, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present here designer water soluble triazolophanes as a platform for mimicking the allosteric disulfide conformation. The allosteric &#8208;LHHook disulfide conformation has been stabilized by a protein like intramolecular S&#183;&#183;&#183;O interaction and intramolecular hydrogen bonding. The striking similarity of the fibrils of the designer macrocycle with amyloids and its autofluorescence is a noteworthy finding.








Abstract
We present here a series of isomeric disulfide&#8208;based hybrid cyclic peptides with different ring sizes. The water soluble pseudopeptidic macrocycles display a high intrinsic tendency to self&#8208;assemble. Microscopic investigations revealed amyloid like fibrillar morphology with autofluorescence. X&#8208;ray crystal structure of 23&#8208;membered macrocycle showed the presence of intramolecular hydrogen bonding and a unique S&#183;&#183;&#183;O interaction. We delineate that the macrocyclic framework is an ideal platform to generate various classes of disulfide conformations. X&#8208;ray structure of the macrocycle further revealed the presence of an allosteric disulfide bond with &#8208;LHHook geometry.

We present high&#8208;frequency/high&#8208;field EPR spectroscopy studies on a series of pentagonal&#8208;bipyramidally coordinated ErIII(DAPMBH/H2DAPS)X complexes with different apical ligands (X&#160;=&#160;(H2O)Cl (1), (CH3OH)N3 (2), Cl2 (3)) to directly determine the electronic properties of the ground state and low&#8208;energy Kramers doublets, namely effective g&#8208;tensors and zero field splittings. Our findings are compared to the results of numerical studies and are used to rationalise the observed differences in magnetic relaxation behavior.








Abstract
High&#8208;frequency/high&#8208;field electron paramagnetic resonance studies on a series of seven&#8208;coordinate pentagonal&#8208;bipyramidal (PBP) erbium(III) complexes Er(DAPMBH/H2DAPS)X (H2DAPMBH&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;diacetylpyridine bis&#8208;4&#8208;methoxy benzoylhydrazone, H4DAPS&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;diacetylpyridine bis&#8208;(salicylhydrazone)) demonstrate the effects of different apical ligands (X&#160;=&#160;(H2O)Cl (1), (CH3OH)N3 (2), Cl2 (3)) on the local magnetic anisotropy of the central ErIII ions. In particular, we report direct experimental determination of the effective g&#8208;values and zero field splittings of the energetically low&#8208;lying Kramers doublets. Our quantitative determination of the magnetic anisotropy highlights the relevance of an axial g&#8208;tensor for SMM behavior and suggests that fast magnetic relaxation is mainly driven by a thermally assisted quantum tunnelling process via low&#8208;lying excited states.

         <title>Organocatalytic Switches of DNA Glycosylase OGG1 Catalyze a Highly Efficient AP&#8208;Lyase Function</title>

Organocatalytic switches are small molecules that combine active site affinity and a nitrogen&#8208;centered base for catalysis, effectively removing the rate&#8208;determining step of the OGG1 biochemical cascade. Here, we identify a minimal structure and modulate the active nitrogen pKa, enabling the catalysis of ultrafast AP site incisions in a range of pH environments. Importantly, improved compounds exhibit potent anti&#8208;fibrotic effects in a patient&#8208;derived model of MASH.








Abstract
8&#8208;oxoGuanine DNA glycosylase 1 (OGG1) is the first known target of organocatalytic switches (ORCAs), which rewrite the biochemical function of the enzyme through redirection of its preferred substrate from 8&#8208;oxoG to AP sites. Previously, different ORCA chemotypes were shown to enhance the operational pH window for OGG1, possibly through direct involvement in proton transfer events during DNA strand cleavage. Accordingly, compound pKa is a crucial and necessary consideration for the identification and application of future OGG1 ORCAs. Here, we identify a minimal structure of organocatalytic switches&#8211;4&#8208;anilino pyridines and 6&#8208;anilino pyrimidines&#8211;which are dimethyl&#8208;amino&#8208;pyridine (DMAP)&#8208;type Br&#248;nsted bases binding the active site of OGG1. Systematic interrogation of compound basicity through modulation of electron&#8208;withdrawing (EWG) and electron&#8208;donating (EDG) substituents reveals that a pKa less or equal to the assay pH is a viable parameter for prediction of compound activity. The lead structure (AC50 13&#160;nM, pKa 7.0) was then identified as a potent scaffold from a screen in a patient&#8208;derived 3D model of metabolic dysfunction&#8208;associated steatohepatitis (MASH), where it reduced hepatic fibrosis by 35%. Collectively, these findings deepen the knowledge of this novel modulator class, with important implications for future enzyme targets and probe development.

         <title>Hybrid pH Responsive Supramolecular Polymers Through the Combination of the Ureido&#8211;Pyrimidinone Motif with &#946;&#8208;Sheet Peptide Sequences</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 33, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of the ureido&#8211;pyrimidinone motif with two different &#946;&#8208;sheet peptide sequences yielded supramolecular structures with significantly different morphologies in water. The resulting supramolecular nanostructures showed structural stability between pH = 5 and 9, while precipitation occurred at pH = 3.0 and random coil formation at pH 12. This work poses the basis for the development of novel responsive supramolecular polymers.








Abstract
Supramolecular biomaterials based on 1D supramolecular polymers in water replicate the fibrous and dynamic structures of natural architectures. Peptides, valued for their biocompatibility, are commonly employed as building blocks for supramolecular biomaterials, often in combination with large aromatic or hydrogen&#8208;bonding groups at the N&#8208;terminus to improve their structural stability. Herein, the self&#8208;assembly properties of two &#946;&#8208;sheet peptides combined with the ureido&#8211;pyrimidinone self&#8208;dimerizing motif in aqueous solution are investigated in detail. The assembly of the resulting molecules is demonstrated to be intimately dependent on the &#946;&#8208;sheet sequence, while the incorporation of a hydrophobic spacer enhances the assembly of the monomers, irrespective of the peptide sequence employed. Furthermore, the assembly of each monomer is significantly enhanced at pH = 3.0 while being stable between pH = 5.0 and 9.0. Only at pH = 12, upon enolate formation, the transition to random coil conformation is observed for all the monomers. The supramolecular polymers developed hereby point to fundamental design principle toward the development of UPy&#8208;peptide based materials with tuneable properties and potential applications in the biomedical fields of research.

         <title>2D MOF Nanozyme&#8208;Enhanced Impedance Detector for Synergistic Biofilm Detection and Removal in Bioelectrochemical Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 33, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a dual&#8208;functional 2D Cu&#8208;BDC nanozyme&#8208;based impedance detector for simultaneous biofilm detection and elimination. The detector achieves sensitive impedance response for biofilm monitoring and enables efficient biofilm clearance via peroxidase&#8208;like activity. This approach offers a novel strategy for improving MFCs efficiency through integrated biofilm real&#8208;time detection and elimination.








Abstract
The formation of biofilm has become a significant influencing factor to microbial fuel cells (MFCs). Developing effective biofilm detection means are highly imperative for improving the efficiency of MFCs. In this study, we propose a 2D metal&#8208;organic framework (2D Cu&#8208;BDC) nanozyme&#8208;based impedance detector for the simultaneous detection and removal of bacterial biofilms. The promising induction interface features good electron transfer and biofilm attachment properties, realizing sensitive biofilm detection. The impedance response change on the functionalized 2D Cu&#8208;BDC detector was 3.5 times higher for Gram&#8208;positive bacteria biofilm and 2.7 times higher for Gram&#8208;negative bacteria biofilm compared to bare electrodes. In addition, the 2D Cu&#8208;BDC nanozyme demonstrates robust peroxidase&#8208;like activity, enabling efficient biofilm degradation&#160;at low H2O2 concentration, and further allowing for real&#8208;time monitoring of the biofilm elimination process. This study provides a novel approach to using MOF&#8208;based biosensors for the simultaneous detection and removal of biofilm in MFCs.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Talented Bismuthinidenes: Double C(sp3)&#9472;I Bond Activation Using Single or Two Bi Centers.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 33, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A study illustrating a tunable reactivity for bismuthinidene complexes toward dihalomethanes is presented. Two types of double activation of C(sp3)&#9472;I bonds of diiodomethane were observed depending on the structure of the ligand. When a Dipp group was present on the nitrogen, the first C&#9472;I bond underwent oxidative addition (OA) toward the bismuth followed by alkylation of the imine function in cooperation with the ligand, whereas a double OA of two C&#9472;I bonds toward two bismuthinidene centers was observed for the tBu analogue.








Abstract
The reaction of [2,6&#8208;(DippN = CH)2C6H3]Bi (1Dipp, Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPrC6H3) with CH2I2 proceeded via double C&#9472;I bond activation yielding [2,6&#8208;(DippN = CH)2C6H3]Bi(&#956;&#8208;(Bi,N)&#9472;CH2)I2 (3). By contrast, the reaction of 1Dipp with 1,2&#8208;diiodoethane provided [2,6&#8208;(DippN&#9552;CH)2C6H3]BiI2 (1DippI2) and ethene. The tert&#8208;butyl analogue [2,6&#8208;(tBuN&#9552;CH)2C6H3]Bi (1tBu) reacted with CH2ClX to give [2,6&#8208;(tBuN&#9552;CH)2C6H3]Bi(CH2Cl)X (X&#9552;I (4) or Cl (5)). Further, its reactivity with CH2I2 was sensitive towards the stoichiometry since using a 1:1 ratio gave a mixture of dinuclear complex {[2,6&#8208;(tBuN&#9552;CH)2C6H3]Bi(I)}2(&#956;&#8208;(Bi,Bi)&#9472;CH2) (6) and [2,6&#8208;(tBuN&#9552;CH)2C6H3]Bi(CH2I)I (7). The reaction could be shifted in favor of 7 using an excess of CH2I2, but with 0.45 eq. of CH2I2 compound 6, as a product of double C&#9472;I bond activation mediated by two Bi atoms was isolated as the main product.

Further, its reactivity with CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was sensitive towards the stoichiometry since using a 1:1 ratio gave a mixture of dinuclear complex {[2,6-(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;BuN&#9552;CH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]Bi(I)}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;-(&lt;i&gt;Bi,Bi&lt;/i&gt;)&#9472;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) (&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;) and [2,6-(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;BuN&#9552;CH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]Bi(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I)I (&lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;). The reaction could be shifted in favor of &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt; using an excess of CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but with 0.45 eq. of CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; compound &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;, as a product of double C&#9472;I bond activation mediated by two Bi atoms was isolated as the main product.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photocatalysis Enables Chemodivergent Radical Polar Crossover: Ritter&#8208;Type Amidation vs Heck&#8208;Type Olefin Carbofunctionalizations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 33, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
One aryl makes the difference: switching styrenes with 1,1&#8208;diaryl olefins as radical acceptors, the benzylic cation intermediate fate changes from Ritter&#8208;type carboamidation to Heck&#8208;type reaction. The decarboxylative photocatalytic chemodivergent methodology enabled broad scope and efficient scalability in both batch and flow. Mechanistic and computational studies demonstrated both radical generation pathways and the origin of product switchability. 








Abstract
Three&#8208;component alkene difunctionalization reactions constitute an ideal platform to rapidly build molecular complexity, enabling the simultaneous introduction of two distinct, orthogonal functional groups into the C&#9552;C bond in a single step. Herein, a photoredox catalyzed Ritter&#8208;type carboamidation of electronically diverse styrenes harnessing non&#8208;stabilized, nucleophilic primary radicals generated from readily&#8208;accessible carboxylic acid&#8208;derived redox active esters is reported. Furthermore, it is found that Heck&#8208;type products are chemoselectively obtained by simply switching aryl olefin acceptors with 1,1&#8208;diarylolefins. In the context of photocatalytic chemodivergent radical polar crossover, the synthesis of various trisubstituted alkenes was achieved, simultaneously revealing a divergence in the activation of redox&#8208;active esters toward reduction. In&#8208;depth mechanistic studies demonstrated both transformation pathways, while DFT calculations indicated the origin of product switchability. Both Ritter&#8208;type and Heck&#8208;type olefin carbofunctionalizations are scalable up to 4&#160;mmol scale in batch and continuous flow, proving the synthetic utility of the methodology.

         <title>Direct Transformation of Bio&#8208;Based Furfural into &#947;&#8208;Valerolactone over SO3H&#8208;Functionalized P&#9472;O&#9472;Hf Hybrid Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 33, June 12, 2025. </description>

SO3H&#8208;functionalized P&#8208;O&#8208;Hf hybrid catalyst GPCS&#8208;Hf(1:1.5) was constructed to be highly efficient for the direct upgrading of furfural (FF) to &#947;&#8208;valerolactone (GVL) in a high yield of 71%, involving multiple reaction steps, mainly attributed to an appropriate amount/distribution of Lewis acid&#8208;base (Hf4+&#8208;O2&#8722;) and Br&#248;nsted acid (H+) sites and favorable texture structure. Moreover, GPCS&#8208;Hf(1:1.5) was highly recyclable with intact multi&#8208;functional motifs.








Abstract
&#947;&#8208;Valerolactone (GVL) has great application potential in organic synthesis and biofuels, while its high&#8208;efficiency production from easily available bio&#8208;based feedstock is challenging. In this work, SO3H&#8208;functionalized P&#8208;O&#8208;Hf hybrid catalysts GPCS&#8208;Hf(n:m) were facilely prepared by solvothermal treatment of glucose&#8208;containing organic precursors (GPC) and Hf4+ in a mass ratio of n:m. The acid strength and Lewis/Br&#248;nsted acid sites of GPCS&#8208;Hf(n:m) could be modulated by tuning the GPC/Hf4+ ratio. Among them, GPCS&#8208;Hf(1:1.5) with appropriate acid&#8208;base properties delivered prominent catalytic activity in the direct upgrading of a bio&#8208;based bulk chemical furfural (FF) to GVL with a good yield of 71%, as optimized by response surface methodology. Especially, the suitable distribution of Lewis acid (Hf4+), Lewis base (O2&#8722;), and Br&#248;nsted acid (H+) sites played a synergistic role in cascade transfer hydrogenation, furan ring opening, second hydrogenation, and lactonization. Moreover, the GPCS&#8208;Hf(1:1.5) catalyst was unveiled to have a uniform elemental dispersion, relatively large specific surface area, and amorphous structure, which might also contribute to its superior efficiency. Recycling experiments showed that GPCS&#8208;Hf(1:1.5) could be reused at least six&#160;times with almost no decline in activity. The overall bio&#8208;derived catalytic conversion system offers a more sustainable manner for biomass valorization.

Abstract
Selective conversion of a functional group to a high&#8208;value product, namely defunctionalization, is an important procedure in synthetic chemistry. Herein, we report the first transition metal&#8208;free desulfurization of thioamides under relatively mild reaction conditions. The catalytic reaction proceeds with the selective cleavage of the C&#9552;S bonds of thioamides to furnish the corresponding amines in good to excellent yields with B(C6F5)3 and PhSiH3. The protocol is simple, does not require any additives, and encompasses a broad substrate scope with chemoselective reduction of vulnerable functional groups. To understand the mechanism, several control studies and detailed computational calculations were performed.

         <title>Alkyl&#8208;&#960; Liquids as Condensed&#8208;State Singlet Oxygen Photosensitizers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 33, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquids are non&#8208;volatile single&#8208;component condensed&#8208;state functional materials that generate singlet oxygen (1O2) at an alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquid&#8208;water interface. Chromophores can be incorporated into alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquids that produce 1O2 and membrane impregnated systems can be fabricated to generate 1O2 that migrates across a membrane&#8208;water interface to destroy small organic molecules, demonstrating the potential for water decontamination.








Abstract
Functional materials capable of generating singlet oxygen (1O2), a highly reactive but short&#8208;lived species used to destroy organic materials, including chemical pollutants and biological entities, typically incorporate a chromophore that acts as a photosensitizer into a tertiary scaffold. Current functional materials that produce 1O2 include metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs), polymeric nanoparticles, modified glasses, and supramolecular assemblies. Whilst multi&#8208;component functional materials have been widely reported, producing functional materials using a single small molecule in a condensed state has hardly been reported. Herein, we report the first use of functional molecular liquids (alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquids), non&#8208;volatile single&#8208;component condensed&#8208;state fluidic materials, as photosensitizers for the generation of 1O2 at an alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquid&#8208;water interface. We investigate the incorporation of various chromophores into alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquids that are suitable for 1O2 production and analyze the molecular structure required to produce efficient alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquid photosensitizers. The alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquids were studied, impregnated into porous membranes, and as thin films on quartz and Si wafers, the limitations of 1O2 production were investigated. A system was successfully fabricated that can generate 1O2 within an alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquid impregnated membrane and migrate across a membrane&#8208;water interface to destroy small organic molecules, demonstrating the potential of these systems for water decontamination.

Chromophores can be incorporated into alkyl-&#960; liquids that produce &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and membrane impregnated systems can be fabricated to generate &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that migrates across a membrane-water interface to destroy small organic molecules, demonstrating the potential for water decontamination.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functional materials capable of generating singlet oxygen (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), a highly reactive but short-lived species used to destroy organic materials, including chemical pollutants and biological entities, typically incorporate a chromophore that acts as a photosensitizer into a tertiary scaffold. Current functional materials that produce &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; include metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent-organic frameworks (COFs), polymeric nanoparticles, modified glasses, and supramolecular assemblies. Whilst multi-component functional materials have been widely reported, producing functional materials using a single small molecule in a condensed state has hardly been reported. Herein, we report the first use of functional molecular liquids (alkyl-&#960; liquids), non-volatile single-component condensed-state fluidic materials, as photosensitizers for the generation of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at an alkyl-&#960; liquid-water interface. We investigate the incorporation of various chromophores into alkyl-&#960; liquids that are suitable for &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production and analyze the molecular structure required to produce efficient alkyl-&#960; liquid photosensitizers. The alkyl-&#960; liquids were studied, impregnated into porous membranes, and as thin films on quartz and Si wafers, the limitations of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production were investigated. A system was successfully fabricated that can generate &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; within an alkyl-&#960; liquid impregnated membrane and migrate across a membrane-water interface to destroy small organic molecules, demonstrating the potential of these systems for water decontamination.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Peripheral Designed Indigo Bola&#8208;Amphiphiles for Supramolecular Assembled Nanoarchitectonics in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 33, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indigo as a biodegradable motif is considerable for constructing a sustainable supramolecular polymer. Considering sustainability prospects, indigo bola&#8208;amphiphiles (IBAs) are designed for which supramolecular assemble as high aspect ratio nanostructures. Instead of using uncommon scandium, bio&#8208;abundant calcium cations can assist in constructing macroscopic materials from IBAs nanostructures with structural packing characterizations.








Abstract
Indigo, an ancient natural dye, featured excellent biodegradability to advance in sustainable polymer. Indigo amphiphiles can pave a way for sustainable supramolecular polymers in aqueous media for potential biomedical functional materials. However, contemporary indigo amphiphiles supramolecular commonly assemble into low aspect ratio nanostructures, which hampers the macroscopic soft scaffolds fabrications and smart functional material applications. In this study, we report a novel peripheral designed indigo bola&#8208;amphiphiles (IBAs), which assemble into high aspect ratio supramolecular nanofibers in aqueous media. By employing a shear&#8208;flow assembly technique with bio&#8208;abundant calcium ions, IBAs assemble across multiple length scales into supramolecular macroscopic scaffolds. The structural characterizations of IBAs macroscopic soft scaffolds show different supramolecular structural packing information by scanning electron microscope and X&#8208;ray scattering/diffraction techniques. Our supramolecular nanoarchitectonic approach indicates the feasibility of using IBAs molecular design to construct supramolecular macroscopic materials with higher structural order for the future smart biofunctional materials and sustainable supramolecular polymer under more environmentally friendly conditions.

         <title>The Energetics of Electron Transfer in Redox&#8208;DNA Layers Mimics That of Redox Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 33, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electron transfer in ferrocene&#8208;labeled DNA (Fc&#8208;DNA) layers mimics that of redox proteins, featuring a low reorganization energy (&#955;). The origin of the low &#955; in Fc&#8208;DNA was unveiled by high&#8208;scan&#8208;rate cyclic voltammetry and molecular dynamics simulations, implying Fc&#8208;DNA as a versatile tool to open new avenues in understanding the ET in biological systems and optimizing the electrochemical applications in biosensing and energy conversion.








Abstract
Redox&#8208;DNA layers have recently shown unique properties, such as tunable reorganization energy of electron transfer that can be modulated by DNA length or hybridization state and completely suppressed under nanoconfinement. These discoveries, attributed to the changes in the solvation of the redox marker and/or fast chain dynamics, provide a unique opportunity to use electrochemical measurements as a tool to address open questions in ion solvation. Moreover, they offer a pathway to clarify the origin of the largely unsolved problem of establishing low activation barriers for biological electron transfer. Here, high&#8208;scan&#8208;rate, variable&#8208;temperature cyclic voltammetry analyzed using the Marcus formalism and molecular dynamics simulations, reveals that the total free energy barrier of electron transfer consists of two additive elements: the reorganization energy of the partially desolvated redox marker and the energy cost for solvation changes of the redox marker at the solid/liquid interface. These results may have profound implications for our understanding of electron transfer and solvation effects in redox proteins, providing opportunities for better design of artificial photosynthetic systems, biosensing, and energy conversion devices.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Prussian Blue Analogs via a Solid&#8208;Solution Storage Mechanism for Long Cycle Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries Cathodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 33, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates a method for synthesizing high&#8208;entropy solid&#8208;solution by incorporating multiple metallic elements into Prussian blue analogs (PBAs). The resulting solid&#8208;solution storage mechanism exhibits not only inhibited phase transitions but also preserved crystalline structure integrity, leading to enhanced electrochemical performance.








Abstract
The open&#8208;framework characteristics of Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) have been recognized as advantages for cathode application in Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Nevertheless, lattice distortions during charge&#8208;discharge cycles critically compromise their cyclability. Recent advancements in high&#8208;entropy design strategies have significantly improved structural stability and energy storage efficiency within functional materials. In this study, we developed the high&#8208;entropy PBAs, K1.68 Mn0.21 Cu0.20 Ni0.20 Co0.19 Fe0.20[Fe(CN)6]0.87&#9633;0.13&#183;0.66H2O, via a cost&#8208;effective aqueous co&#8208;precipitation method. Notably, this approach facilitates the concurrent incorporation of five transition metals (Mn, Cu, Ni, Co, and Fe), thereby establishing a stable crystalline framework. Electrochemical characterization demonstrates that the cathode achieves a specific capacity of 124.9 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.025 A g&#8722;1. At various current densities (0.025&#8211;1 A g&#8722;1), the cathode maintains a particular capacity retention of 62.1% during rate testing. Furthermore, the cathode exhibits exceptional cyclability preserving 78.7% capacity at 1 A g&#8722;1 after 3000 cycles. Operando X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirms the formation of a reversible solid&#8208;solution intercalation/extraction mechanism process, which prevents phase transitions and enhances cyclability. This high&#8208;entropy material holds significant potential as a cathode for SIBs, offering high specific capacity and outstanding long&#8208;term cycling stability. These superior properties position it as a competitive candidate for advanced energy storage systems.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Enabled Pathway Complexity in Supramolecular Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 33, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, we report a unique pathway complexity in supramolecular hydrogels. We demonstrate that chemical reduction followed by oxidation creates a kinetically trapped state, which evolves into various network structures, morphologies, and macroscopic stiffness.








Abstract
Pathway complexity in supramolecular assemblies presents a unique opportunity for a single, relatively simple system to exhibit a wide range of properties allowing for multifunctionality. In this study, we report redox&#8208;enabled pathway complexity in amino acid&#8208;functionalized perylene diimides (PDIs) and its consequence for the macroscopic hydrogel network. We show that chemical reduction and subsequent oxidation enable a kinetically trapped state which transforms into different network morphologies in response to heat and time. Our finding that pathway complexity in supramolecular systems can alter bulk material properties suggests the potential for future development of dynamic materials that achieve multiple macroscopic functions with a single building block.

         <title>Ir/Ni Metallaphotoredox Catalysis for the C(sp3)&#9472;H Bond &#945;&#8208;Arylation and Alkylation of N&#8208;Alkyl N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>

Ir/Ni metallaphotoredox system enables the regioselective &#945;&#8208;arylation and alkylation of N&#8208;alkyl heterocycles via C(sp3)&#9472;H bond functionalization. This method bypasses traditional Sn2 pathways and offers complementary regioselectivity to transition metal catalysis. The approach shows good substrate scope and high yields, with mechanistic studies supporting the arylation of carbon&#8208;centered radicals generated through single&#8208;electron transfer (SET).








Abstract
In this work, we report a regioselective C(sp3)&#9472;H bond &#945;&#8208;arylation and alkylation of N&#8208;alkyl heterocycles (carbazoles, indoles and indazoles) using a Ir/Ni metallaphotoredox catalysis. This approach enables the direct functionalization of unactivated C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds at the &#945;&#8208;position of nitrogen heterocycles, offering an efficient alternative to traditional Sn2 methods and providing complementary regioselectivity to transition metal catalysis, which often results in C(sp2)&#9472;H bond arylation. The reaction employs [Ir(dF(CF3)ppy)2(dtbbpy)][PF6] as the photocatalyst and NiCl2(dtbbpy) as the nickel source, facilitating single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) to promote radical generation and organometallic elementary cross&#8208;coupling steps. The methodology allows the use of diverse aryl chlorides and alkenes demonstrating broad substrate scope and high functional group tolerance. Mechanistic investigations, including radical trapping and and Stern&#8211;Volmer experiments, support a photocatalytic radical pathway. This metallaphotoredox protocol presents a robust and atom&#8208;economical route to synthesizing valuable N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;N&#8208;aryl heterocycles.

         <title>Salt or Cocrystal Puzzle Solved by Mechanochemistry: The Role of Solvent in the Pamoic Acid Case Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 33, June 12, 2025. </description>

Pamoic acid:quinoline cocrystal and pamoate:quinolinium salts can be synthetized by mechanochemistry tuning the reaction conditions. Computational analysis of the crystal packing reveals the main factors driving the formation of either forms. This approach and subsequent rationalization pave the way to the synthesis of pharmaceutically active multicomponent systems with tunable properties.








Abstract
Many drugs are nowadays marketed as salts. Cocrystallization is also emerging as a convenient tool to modify in vivo activity of pharmacologically active compounds. Given the marked difference in physicochemical properties between salts and cocrystals, the possibility of obtaining crystalline systems composed of the same building blocks in their neutral or charged form is desirable. Pamoic acid (PAM) is widely used in pharmaceutical formulation as pamoate salt, and we here propose a unique synthetic strategy to obtain a cocrystal of PAM rather than a salt by tuning mechanochemical conditions. Our findings have been corroborated by means of computational analyses, relating to the noncovalent interactions in the crystal structure with the formation of the different crystalline forms. A detailed analysis of the structure containing PAM in its neutral, anionic or dianionic form present in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) helped generalizing our results.

Three novel and multifunctional heterometallic [LnIII2CoII5] clusters have been reported. Notably, these heterometallic clusters show well magnetic behaviors and can effectively catalyze CO2 with epoxides and amines under mild conditions simultaneously.








Abstract
Three heterometallic [LnIII2CoII5] clusters with the formulas [LnIII2CoII5(L1)2(L2)2(L3)2(OAc)4(NO3)2]&#183;4CH3CN (LnIII&#160;=&#160;Gd (1), Tb (2), and Dy (3); HL1 = (E)&#8208;1&#8208;((2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;methoxybenzylidene)amino)naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ol, HL2&#160;=&#160;1&#8208;aminonaphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ol, and HL3&#160;=&#160;trimethylopropane) have been obtained via self&#8208;assembly of mixed ligands strategy. Significantly, cluster 1 displays a larger magnetocaloric effect (MCE) (&#8722;&#916;Sm&#160;=&#160;36.83&#160;J kg&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 at 2.0&#160;K and 7.0 T), while cluster 3 shows slow magnetic relaxation behavior under zero dc field. Moreover, clusters 1&#8211;3 as heterogeneous catalysts can effectively convert CO2 with epoxides and benzylamine to form oxazolidinones under mild conditions. To our knowledge, it is the first reported bifunctional heterometallic heptanuclear clusters which show well magnetic behaviors and can effectively catalyze CO2 with epoxides and amines under mild conditions simultaneously.

This study focuses on the development of a Pt&#8208;decorated NiMo&#8208;based carbon&#8208;supported catalyst (Pt&#8208;NiMo/C) through a solvent evaporation and high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis method, which shows excellent performance in the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction with low overpotentials, high stability, and great potential for industrial&#8208;scale water electrolysis and energy conversion applications.








Abstract
In response to the urgent demand for sustainable hydrogen production under industrial high&#8208;current&#8208;density conditions, this study presents the development of a Pt&#8208;decorated NiMo&#8208;based carbon&#8208;supported catalyst (Pt&#8208;NiMo/C) for efficient alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The catalyst was synthesized via a solvent evaporation method followed by high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis, achieving uniform dispersion of Pt&#8208;NiMo nanoparticles on conductive carbon. Electrochemical evaluations revealed exceptional HER performance with ultralow overpotentials of 20 and 170&#160;mV versus RHE at current densities of 10 and 100&#160;mA cm&#8315;2, respectively, surpassing commercial Pt/C benchmarks. The Pt&#8208;NiMo catalyst demonstrated robust stability over 120 hours at 100&#160;mA cm&#8315;2, attributed to its hierarchical structure and synergistic electronic interactions between Pt and NiMo. The MEA configuration showcased stable electrochemical performance with a current density of 100&#160;mA cm&#8315;2 at a cell voltage of 1.53&#160;V versus RHE, highlighting its potential for efficient energy conversion applications such as water electrolysis or fuel cells. These results underscore the catalyst's potential for industrial&#8208;scale water electrolysis, offering a cost&#8208;effective and durable solution for green hydrogen production.

         <title>Copper (II) Triflate/ Vitamin&#8208;C Promoted Modified Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman Annulation: A Facile Route to Fluorescent Cyclopentene Derivatives</title>

         <dc:description>
Herein, a copper triflate (Cu(OTf)2) promoted Intramolecular Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman(IMBH) annulation protocol is reported for the synthesis of fused cyclopentenoids which in turn act as molecular sensors for hazardous amine detection. A characteristic interconversion via 1,5&#8208;H shift between two non&#8208;separable isomeric mixtures of cyclopentene derivatives, and a solvent&#8208;free organic acid mediated version of the protocol, provide exciting dimensions to this work.








Abstract
Herein we report a rapid and efficient method for the synthesis of fused cyclopentenoids via Intramolecular Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (IMBH) annulation. In this approach, copper triflate (Cu(OTf)2) serves as the promoter, favoring cyclization and aromatization over the conventional MBH addition product. A characteristic feature among most of the cyclized product contain two non&#8208;separable isomeric mixture of cyclopentene derivatives which has been readily interconverted via 1,5&#8208;H shift. This sigmatropic shift has been proved via deuterium labelling experiment using the first synthesized 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;6&#8208;methoxy&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydronaphthalene&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehyde&#8208;d. The equilibration of two cyclopentadiene ring via sigmatropic shift has also been characterized by 2D NMR experiment. The scale&#8208;up experiment in the modified IMBH reaction also flourish our protocol significantly. Additionally, the same compounds have also been synthesized in solvent&#8208;free conditions using organic acids, which reduces the use of hazardous substances, providing an alternate pathway for the IMBH reaction avoiding conventional aqueous work&#8208;up. Moreover, this novel IMBH reaction has been thoroughly investigated and elucidated using Density Functional Theory (DFT). The construction of such fluorescent derivatives and the evaluation of their unique photophysical properties revealed acid&#8208;base interactions with active methylene groups, facilitating their use as sensors of hazardous amine derivatives via fluorescence quenching mechanism.

         <title>Impacts of Chalcogen Bonding on the Stability and Reactivity of 5&#8208;Iminothianthrene Platform: Toward Electrophilic Nitrogen Sources</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 33, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
5&#8208;Iminothianthrene reacted with various electrophiles, such as acid chlorides, protons, and iso(thio)cyanates, to afford the corresponding adducts. Intramolecular chalcogen bonding (ChB) was identified through natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis based on their X&#8208;ray crystal structures. The potential of these adducts as electrophilic aminating reagents was demonstrated.








Abstract
The thianthrene scaffold has recently attracted significant attention in various coupling reactions. Although 5&#8208;iminothianthrene and its derivatives are expected to function as electrophilic aminating reagents, their properties and reactivity have not been fully investigated. In this work, it was found that 5&#8208;iminothianthrene reacted with various electrophiles, such as acid chlorides, protons, and isothiocyanates to give the corresponding adducts. In addition, intramolecular chalcogen bonding (ChB) was identified in those adducts, and this interaction was found to contribute to their stability and reactivity. Finally, the potential of N&#8208;acyliminothianthrenes as N&#8208;acylnitrene equivalents was demonstrated.

         <title>Transition Metal/Metal Sulfide Heterostructures Boost Energy Saving Hydrogen Production Coupled with Sulfion Degradation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 33, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We constructed a bifunctional electrode with an inner Cr layer and outer components of Co, Mo, and the Co9S8 phase (NiFe&#8208;CrCoMo&#8208;S) through stepwise electrodeposition and hydrothermal sulfurization. Benefiting from the hydrophilic and sulfur&#8208;repellent surface and rich metal/metal sulfide heterostructures, the coupled electrolysis system demonstrates excellent performance for energy saving hydrogen production and sulfur recovery.








Abstract
Hydrogen production through the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) provides a promising pathway for sustainable and green energy. Coupling HER with the thermodynamically favorable sulfion oxidation reaction (SOR) can reduce energy consumption and recycle industrial by&#8208;product S2&#8722;. However, the development and practical application are hindered by the lack of cost&#8208;effective and robust catalysts. Herein, we constructed a bifunctional electrode with rich metal/metal sulfide heterostructures using NiFe foam through stepwise electrodeposition and hydrothermal sulfurization (NiFe&#8208;CrCoMo&#8208;S). Benefiting from the hydrophilic and sulfur&#8208;repellent surface and rich metal/metal sulfide heterostructures, it delivers outstanding SOR and HER performance. The integrated cell, utilizing the NiFe&#8208;CrCoMo&#8208;S electrode for both the cathode and anode, achieves a remarkable cell voltage of 0.75 V at a current density of 200 mA cm&#8722;2, which is 1.43 V lower than conventional water electrolysis. It demonstrates extraordinary long&#8208;term durability over 1100 hours without significant decay, achieving high Faradaic efficiencies (&#8805;99%) and low electricity consumption (1.79 kWh m&#8722;3 H2) for hydrogen production. This work paves the way for environmentally friendly strategies, combining cost&#8208;effective hydrogen production with value&#8208;added sulfur recovery, offering a reliable option for bifunctional catalyst design.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Intermolecular O&#8208;Peptidylation Protocol Enabled by Sequential Acyl Transfer on Thiol&#8208;Incorporated Threonine Followed by Desulfurization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 33, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The late&#8208;stage intermolecular O&#8208;acylation of the threonine (Thr) side chain was accomplished by reacting thiol&#8208;incorporated Thr with a peptide thioester in open air. The thioester, which contained the volatile trifluoroethanethiol, facilitated the formation of S,O&#8208;diacyl peptides. These were subsequently converted into the desired O&#8208;acyl threonine isopeptide through silver&#8208;mediated thioester selective activation followed by desulfurization.








Abstract
The thiol functionality on the methyl group of a threonine derivative [Thr(SH)] facilitates O&#8208;acylation of the Thr hydroxy group with a thioester. We previously showed that a Thr(SH)&#8208;incorporated peptide thioester can be converted to the corresponding Thr&#8208;containing cyclic depsipeptide through intramolecular thioester exchange (S&#9472;S acyl transfer) and subsequent desulfurization of the O&#8208;acyl peptide resulting from intramolecular S&#9472;O acyl transfer. Based on our success in depsipeptide synthesis, we applied the Thr(SH)&#8208;facilitated protocol to the synthesis of branched O&#8208;acyl isopeptides. Initial attempts identified two issues. First, the S&#8208;acylation step with a thioester proceeds in an entropically preferential manner in cyclic depsipeptide synthesis, but not in the case of branched isopeptides. Using a highly volatile thiol component in the thioester solved this issue. Second, the intermolecular thioester change step was accompanied by the formation of an S,O&#8208;diacyl intermediate as a major component; this issue was solved by using thioester&#8208;selective activation of the diacyl species with silver(I) salt followed by desulfurization. Ultimately, the optimized Thr(SH)&#8208;mediated protocol facilitated the late&#8208;stage O&#8208;acylation of a Thr residue in peptide sequences. We show that the protocol has wide substrate scope and demonstrate its application to ubiquitination of the Thr residue of HOIL&#8208;1 peptide.

         <title>Combination of Arsines and Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane Toward Frustrated Lewis Pair</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 33, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study systematically investigates the reactivity of arsine&#8211;borane Lewis pairs, which had not been explored previously. Using tertiary arsines with different steric and electronic properties, the formation of classical Lewis adducts, FLP&#8208;type encounter complexes, and arsonium borate adducts with B(C6F5)3 was demonstrated. Their reactivity toward small molecules and detailed structural characterization were also reported.








Abstract
Various combinations of Lewis acids and bases, particularly frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs), have been investigated for their distinctive reactivities. Nevertheless, to date, no systematic study of arsine&#8211;borane Lewis pairs has been reported. In this study, tertiary arsines with different degrees of steric hindrance and electron&#8208;donating abilities were used. Depending on their steric and electronic properties, arsines form classical Lewis adducts, FLPs, or arsonium borate adducts with tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (B(C6F5)3). Experimental and computational analyzes revealed that trimesitylarsine and B(C6F5)3 form an encounter complex in solution, which is referred to as an FLP adduct. Furthermore, the arsine&#8211;borane pairs react with phenylacetylene and diphenyl disulfide to afford the corresponding arsonium borate adduct and thioarsonium thioborate salt, respectively. The structures of the products were characterized using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Affinity&#8208;Based Protein Profiling Reveals IDH2 as a Mitochondrial Target of Cannabinol in Receptor&#8208;Independent Neuroprotection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 33, June 12, 2025. </description>

A chemical probe CBN&#8208;P based on the neuroprotective cannabinoid cannabinol (CBN) was developed and synthesized. CNB&#8208;P was found to have a similar mechanism of action as the parent compound and was used in click&#8208;CLEM microscopy studies and affinity&#8208;based protein profiling to identify the mitochondrial protein isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) as one target of CBN.








Abstract
Phytocannabinoids are attracting growing attention because of their potential for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Among them, the &#8220;minor&#8221; cannabinoid, cannabinol (CBN), has emerged as a promising neuroprotective agent, acting independently of classical cannabinoid receptors through as&#8208;yet unidentified mitochondrial targets. To uncover the molecular basis of its neuroprotective effects, we designed and synthesized a chemical probe based on CBN, incorporating a minimalist diazirine linker. Functional assays confirmed that the probe retains CBN's mitochondrial activity and exhibits strong mitochondrial enrichment, as demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy and click&#8208;correlative light and electron microscopy (click&#8208;CLEM). By affinity&#8208;based protein profiling (AfBPP), we identified isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) as a key mitochondrial target of CBN. This finding was further substantiated by siRNA knockdown studies, which revealed that the absence of IDH2 partially phenocopies CBN's effects, validating its role as a critical mediator of CBN's neuroprotective activity.

For the first time, the bench&#8208;stable N&#8208;sulfonyl imidazoliums prepared by us were used as the highly efficient coupling reagents and sulfonating reagents, and they were successfully applied in synthesis of amides, dipeptides, solid phase polypeptide, carboxylic esters, carboxylic thioesters, phosphamides, phosphoesters, glycosides, sulfonamides, and sulfonates in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields.








Abstract
Here, we report a novel strategy for the first time: bench&#8208;stable N&#8208;sulfonyl imidazoliums were used as the robust and versatile coupling reagents and sulfonating reagents. Fast reactions of N&#8208;sulfonyl imidazoliums with carboxylic acids or phosphodiesters formed carboxylic acid&#8208;sulfonic acid mixed anhydrides and phospho&#8208;sulfonic acid mixed anhydrides, respectively, and the subsequent treatments of the highly active intermediates with the corresponding nucleophilic partners in the presence of imidazoles at room temperature provided amides, dipeptides, carboxylic esters, carboxylic thioesters (almost without racemization during the formation of amides, dipeptides, esters, thioesters), phosphamides, and phosphoesters in high to excellent yields. This kind of N&#8208;sulfonyl imidazolium as the coupling reagent was successfully applied in solid phase synthesis of a polypeptide containing 32 amino acid residues. This strategy was effectively extended to the construction of glycosides, and high steroselectivity and good yields were provided. In addition, reactions of N&#8208;sulfonyl imidazoliums with amines or alcohols afforded the corresponding sulfonamides and sulfonates in excellent yields. This study should provide a highly efficient, economical, and practical strategy for construction of diverse molecules.

         <title>An Asymmetric Reductive Amination Synthesis of Ritlecitinib Using (S)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Methylbenzylamine as Chiral Auxiliary</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 33, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free synthesis of ritlecitinib employs asymmetric reductive amination via a chiral auxiliary with titanium(IV) ethoxide/sodium tetrahydroborate (Ti(OEt)&#8324;/NaBH&#8324;). This one&#8208;pot process couples a ketone&#8208;amino acid with (S)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methylbenzylamine (85% yield, 86:14 dr). Cyclization affords a &#948;&#8208;lactam (60%), transformed into ritlecitinib via a five&#8208;step sequence (62% overall yield), avoiding precious metals and hazardous reagents in chiral piperidine assembly.








Abstract
We present a new synthesis of ritlecitinib, employing asymmetric reductive amination via a chiral auxiliary group combined with intramolecular amide formation. This method employs a titanium(IV) ethoxide/sodium tetrahydroborate (Ti(OEt)&#8324;/NaBH&#8324;) reductive system to achieve a one&#8208;pot condensation&#8208;reduction of the ketone&#8208;amino acid derivative with (S)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methylbenzylamine, resulting in an 85% yield of the di&#8208;amino acid derivative with a diastereomeric ratio of 86:14. The incorporation of a chiral auxiliary substantially enhances the diastereopurity. Subsequently, acetic acid&#8208;mediated cyclization then forms the &#948;&#8208;lactam in 60% yield. This lactam is converted to ritlecitinib via a five&#8208;step sequence in 62% overall yield. This approach effectively circumvents the use of precious metal catalysts or hazardous reagents for constructing the chiral piperidine moiety, which were essential components in prior synthetic route.

     alt="An Asymmetric Reductive Amination Synthesis of Ritlecitinib Using (S)-&#945;-Methylbenzylamine as Chiral Auxiliary"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A metal-free synthesis of ritlecitinib employs asymmetric reductive amination via a chiral auxiliary with titanium(IV) ethoxide/sodium tetrahydroborate (Ti(OEt)&#8324;/NaBH&#8324;). This one-pot process couples a ketone-amino acid with (S)-&#945;-methylbenzylamine (85% yield, 86:14 dr). Cyclization affords a &#948;-lactam (60%), transformed into ritlecitinib via a five-step sequence (62% overall yield), avoiding precious metals and hazardous reagents in chiral piperidine assembly.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present a new synthesis of ritlecitinib, employing asymmetric reductive amination via a chiral auxiliary group combined with intramolecular amide formation. This method employs a titanium(IV) ethoxide/sodium tetrahydroborate (Ti(OEt)&#8324;/NaBH&#8324;) reductive system to achieve a one-pot condensation-reduction of the ketone-amino acid derivative with (S)-&#945;-methylbenzylamine, resulting in an 85% yield of the di-amino acid derivative with a diastereomeric ratio of 86:14. The incorporation of a chiral auxiliary substantially enhances the diastereopurity. Subsequently, acetic acid-mediated cyclization then forms the &#948;-lactam in 60% yield. This lactam is converted to ritlecitinib via a five-step sequence in 62% overall yield.

         <title>The Role of Asparagine as a Gatekeeper Residue in the Selective Binding of Rare Earth Elements by Lanthanide&#8208;Binding Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 33, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lanthanide binding tags (LBTs) have been utilized as a green extractant to selectively separate rare earth elements (REEs). We reveal up from the molecular level how the N5 asparagine residue is indispensable in imparting selective complexation between lighter and heavier lanthanides by conformationally functioning as a gate. We demonstrate that for the smaller Ln3+ cations&#160;like Lu3+ the gate remains locked by an inter&#8208;arm hydrogen bond between N5 and E14 residues, locking the binding pocket. In contrast, for larger Ln3+ cations like La3+, the gate is open, allowing water to infiltrate inside the pocket.








Abstract
Lanthanide&#8208;binding tag (LBT) peptides selectively complex lanthanide cations (Ln3+) in their binding pockets and are promising for lanthanide separation. However, designing LBTs that selectively target specific Ln3+ cations remains a challenge due to limited molecular&#8208;level understanding and control of interactions within the lanthanide&#8208;binding pocket. In this study, we reveal that the N5 asparagine residue acts as a gatekeeper in the binding pocket, resulting in a 100&#8208;fold selectivity for smaller Lu3+ over larger La3+ cations. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations show that the N5 residue weakly binds to the larger La3+ cation, permitting H2O molecules inside the pocket. For the smaller Lu3+ cations, the N5 residue forms an inter&#8208;arm hydrogen bond with the E14 glutamic acid residue, locking the Lu3+ cation in the pocket and preventing H2O infiltration. Mutating the N5 asparagine to a D5 aspartic acid prevents such a hydrogen bond, eliminating the gatekeeping mechanism and precipitously reducing selectivity. The resulting binding affinity to Ln3+ cations is non&#8208;monotonic but generally increases with cation size. These results suggest a molecular design paradigm: the reduced affinity for larger lanthanides is due to open pocket conformations, while the selectivity of smaller Ln3+ cations over larger ones is due to the gatekeeping hydrogen bond.

         <title>Synthesis of a Station&#8208;Less Molecular Daisy Chain</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 33, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A daisy chain compound lacking intercomponent recognition motifs is synthesized and analyzed. As a result of the absence of intercomponent recognition motifs there was also no preferred conformation of the interlocked components observed.








Abstract
A daisy chain architecture without a preferred low energy arrangement of the mechanically linked components is presented. The molecular design combines a rigid&#8208;rod type oligophenylene ethynylene subunit with an oligoethylene glycol macrocycle that features a bipyridine coordination site. The daisy chain dimer was synthesized via kinetic trapping of the interlocked structure using a Cadiot&#8211;Chodkiewicz active metal template reaction. Comparison of the isolated interlocked dimer with its monomeric analogue indicates the presence of a variety of different geometries for the molecular daisy chain. The dynamic sliding motion in the daisy chain is studied by variable temperature UV&#8211;vis and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy experiments, which point to a highly mobile system even at low temperatures.

         <title>Oxidative Thiolated Aromatization of Terpenes for Divergent Construction of Organosulfur Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 33, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convergent and divergent strategy has been developed for the construction of sulfur&#8208;containing terpenoid derivatives using various terpenes with different oxidation states. It is expected that this protocol may be of broad interest in chemistry community pursuing the transformation of terpenes and constitutes a practical alternative to the synthesis of natural products and pharmaceuticals.








Abstract
Synthetic transformation of terpenoids represents a long&#8208;standing research topic in organic synthesis. Due to the presence of multiple oxidation states and isomers in naturally abundant terpenoids, their separation and efficient utilization pose challenges. Convergent transformations of various terpenes can circumvent these issues. We herein developed a convergent and divergent strategy for control of oxidation states, enabling the construction of sulfur&#8208;containing terpenoid derivatives using various terpenes. This protocol features broad substrate scope, good functional compatibility, and high redox&#8208;selectivity. Convergent synthesis strategy was implemented smoothly by using drug and plant extracts. The synthesis of sulfoxide and sulfone products was further achieved by modulating the oxidation conditions, respectively. Additionally, the products can undergo an array of elaborate transformations, which highlight the potential applications of this strategy.

         <title>Stannylenes Bearing an Amino&#8208;Linked NHC Ligand as Efficient Catalysts for Hydroboration of Carbonyls and Imines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 33, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a series of three&#8208;coordinate stannylenes featuring an amino&#8208;linked NHC ligand. The bis(trimethylsilyl)amino derivative showed excellent catalytic efficiency in hydroboration of aldehydes, ketones, and imines under mild conditions. These findings demonstrate the promise of NHC&#8208;supported stannylenes as versatile tin(II) catalysts, for efficient and selective hydroboration using main group elements.








Abstract
We designed and synthesized a series of three&#8208;coordinated stannylenes featuring an amino&#8208;linked NHC ligand, specifically tailored for the hydroboration of carbonyl compounds and imines. To fine&#8208;tune the catalytic performance both sterically and electronically, various substituents (chloro, triflate, and bis(trimethylsilyl)amino groups) were introduced at the tin center, generating structurally diverse stannylenes. The molecular structures of these stannylenes were confirmed by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The hydroboration of carbonyl compounds catalyzed by these stannylenes proceeded under mild reaction conditions, affording the corresponding boryl esters in excellent yields with high chemoselectivity. Notably, bis(trimethylsilyl)aminostannylene exhibited outstanding catalytic efficiency, enabling hydroboration with a minimal catalyst loading of 0.01 mol% for aldehydes and 0.1 mol% for ketones, and was tolerant of a wide range of substrates, including sterically hindered and electronically diverse carbonyl compounds. Furthermore, in the hydroboration of imines, the reaction proceeded efficiently with just 5 mol% catalyst, furnishing the corresponding borylamines in high yields. Based on stoichiometric experiments, we propose a plausible catalytic cycle for stannylene&#8208;mediated hydroboration.

         <title>Interesting Aromaticity of Franck&#8211;Condon Excited States of Cyclo[16]Carbon</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 33, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic structure and aromaticity of Franck&#8211;Condon excited states of cyclo[16]carbon (C16) have been investigated. The results show that at the ground&#8208;state (S0 state) geometry, C16 exhibits aromaticity not only in triplet states (T1(in&#8594;out), T2(out&#8594;out), and T3(in&#8594;in)), but also more pronounced in the quintet&#160;state (Q1 state). Quantitatively, C16 is about three times more aromatic in the quintet&#160;state than in the triplet states.








Abstract
Inspired by the realization of cyclo[16]carbon (C16) and driven by curiosity about its properties in excited states, a comprehensive theoretical study was conducted on the aromatic characteristics in the Franck&#8211;Condon states of C16. This work demonstrates that at the ground&#8208;state (S0 state) geometry, C16 exhibits aromaticity not only in the triplet states (T1(in&#8594;out), T2(out&#8594;out), and T3(in&#8594;in)), but also more prominently in the quintet&#160;state (Q1 state), and different electronic transition modes result in different essential sources of aromaticity for each excited state. Quantitatively, C16 is about three times more aromatic in the quintet&#160;state than in the triplet states.&#160;These conclusions are supported by multiple robust indicators such as atomic force, induced current, and magnetic shielding, from qualitative, quantitative, and graphical perspectives.

         <title>Fluorenyl Cations: Synthesis and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review covers the history of fluorenyl cations from Deno&#8217;s first report in 1954 on the parent fluorenyl cation to the present. The parent cation and most derivatives have only been observed as a fleeting species by mass spectrometry, UV/Vis spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, or NMR spectroscopy. The most common synthetic routes to fluorenyl cations are by dihydroxylation and halide abstraction of substituted fluorenyl precursors. Over the 71 year history, many advancements have been made with recent developments leading to isolable species including two characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction. The scope of this review covers the field of fluorenyl cations in addition to related species with different aromatic groups in place of benzene fused to the cycopentadienyl core.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamics of Ligand and Guest in 1D Hg(II)&#8208;Bispidine Coordination Polymers with Different Topologies Investigated by Solid&#8208;State NMR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1D coordination polymers (CPs) made of parallel, weakly interacting chains have been recently proposed for the selective adsorption of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), one of the main sources of air and water pollution. Since the efficiency of adsorption for VOC removal strongly depends on the specific and stable interactions between the volatile species and the CP framework, the characterization at the atomic level of host&#8208;guest interactions and guest dynamics is of particular interest. Here, low&#8208; and high&#8208;resolution solid&#8208;state NMR experiments were applied to acquire information on ligand and guest dynamics for two 1D CPs (1&#8208;ClBz and 2&#8208;ClBz), both containing a bispidine organic ligand, Hg(II) as metal center, and chlorobenzene trapped within the framework, but featuring different topologies. By combining analyses of on resonance 1H free induction decays, 1H and 13C longitudinal relaxation times, and 2H quadrupole echo spectra, it was found that chlorobenzene undergoes fast dynamics, mainly isotropic, in 1&#8208;ClBz, while it shows slower anisotropic motions in 2&#8208;ClBz, indicating stronger interactions between framework and adsorbate in the latter associated to the lower available free volume. Ligands are quite rigid for both CPs in the investigated frequency scale, apart from methyl groups, which undergo fast motions about their ternary symmetry axes.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Engineering of 1D Porphyrin&#8208;Crbazole Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with one&#8208;dimensional (1D) architectures hold great potential for photocatalysis but face challenges in rational structural design and charge transfer optimization. Herein, we report a series of 1D porphyrin&#8208;carbazole&#8208;based COFs (MPor&#8208;Phn&#8208;CZ; M = H2, Zn; n = 0, 1) constructed via symmetry&#8208;guided Schiff&#8208;base condensation. The integration of a phenyl spacer (Ph) and metal&#8208;free porphyrin knots in H2Por&#8208;Ph&#8208;CZ enabled an eclipsed AA stacking mode, yielding enhanced crystallinity, a high specific surface area, and optimal donor&#8208;acceptor interactions. Systematic optoelectronic characterization revealed that H2Por&#8208;Ph&#8208;CZ exhibited superior visible&#8208;light absorption, minimized charge recombination, and directional electron transfer from carbazole donors to porphyrin acceptors, as validated by DFT calculations. These attributes endowed H2Por&#8208;Ph&#8208;CZ with exceptional photocatalytic activity in both oxidative coupling of amines and reductive dehalogenation of &#945;&#8208;bromoacetophenone derivatives, outperforming Zn&#8208;incorporated and spacer&#8208;free analogs. This work establishes a design paradigm for 1D COFs through synergistic topology control and electronic modulation, advancing their application in sustainable organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>The Molecular Properties of Honey Bee Acetylcholinesterase Reveal Opportunities to Avoid Off&#8208;Target Effects in Insecticide Discovery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) regulates nerve signalling and is a well&#8208;validated target for insect control in both agriculture and the prevention of mosquito&#8208;borne diseases. However, current AChE&#8208;targeting insecticides are non&#8208;specific and thus also affect other organisms such as honey bees. The synaptic AChE of honey bees (AChE2) is encoded by the ace&#8208;2 gene, thought to have originated from a gene duplication of ace&#8208;1. Here, we analyse the structure, dynamics, and kinetics of AChE2 enzymes from the honey bee, Apis mellifera (AmAChE2), and the malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae (AgAChE2), and compare them to the more extensively studied type 1 mosquito AChE (AgAChE1) and mammalian AChEs. Important differences between these AChE subtypes were identified. Profiling with selected non&#8208;covalent AChE inhibitors revealed strong AChE2 inhibitors, but the inhibition profiles of AChE2 differed substantially from those for AgAChE1 and human AChE. Modelling of AChE2&#8226;inhibitor complexes revealed two tyrosines unique to AChE2 that are responsible for these differences in inhibitor sensitivity. These results highlight the importance of considering molecular properties of AChE2 when developing AChE1 inhibitors for pest control. Furthermore, the results also suggest that including AChE2 in computer&#8208;aided molecular design efforts during the discovery process could be very valuable for reducing risks of off&#8208;target effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Supercritical CO2&#8208;Induced Ferromagnetism in 2D C3N4 for Catalysis in Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exploration of high&#8208;efficient catalysts has been an essential challenge for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) amorphous carbon nitride (a&#8208;C3N4) with obvious ferromagnetism was achieved through a typical supercritical CO2 (SC CO2) treatment process. The experimental results revealed the structural and chemical transformations during the formation of a&#8208;C3N4. Subsequently, a&#8208;C3N4 anchored with Ru nanoparticles (Ru/a&#8208;C3N4) was successfully synthesized and employed as a catalyst for the electrocatalytic HER, exhibiting a significantly enhanced catalytic performance compared to Ru nanoparticles anchored on 2D graphitized carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) without SC CO2 treatment.

         <title>Vinylene&#8208;Linked Fully Conjugated 3D Covalent Organic Polymers for Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic polymers (COPs), featuring conjugated architectures, high porosity, and structural tenability, have emerged as promising candidates for photocatalytic applications. However, the design and synthesis of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) sp2&#8208;carbon&#8208;conjugated COPs, along with their photocatalytic performances, remain underexplored. Here, we synthesized two novel vinylene&#8208;linked fully conjugated 3D COPs (BUCT&#8208;COP&#8208;50 and BUCT&#8208;COP&#8208;51) through the saddle&#8208;shaped building blocks. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation, both materials demonstrated efficient hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation, with BUCT&#8208;COP&#8208;51 (thiophene&#8208;enriched) achieving a remarkable production rate of 3.21 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 in pure water, higher than BUCT&#8208;COP&#8208;50 (benzene&#8208;modified, 2.16 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1). Mechanistic investigations revealed that the H2O2 generation predominantly proceeded via the indirect two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction pathway. The superior performance for BUCT&#8208;COP&#8208;51 could attributed to its narrower bandgap, broader light absorption range, and higher conductivity. This work illustrates that vinylene&#8208;linked fully conjugated 3D COPs could be as promising semiconductors in environmental and energy&#8208;related fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Progress and Development Trends in the Research and Application of Anti&#8208;Icing Coatings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the anti&#8208;icing capabilities and mechanisms of superhydrophobic coatings, super&#8208;slippery coatings (SLIPS), and energy conversion coatings based on their chemical nature. It also encapsulates the development of both monofunctional and multifunctional coatings in anti&#8208;icing applications, evaluates their respective advantages and disadvantages, and delves into the future outlook as well as potential problem&#8208;solving approaches.








Abstract
Annual global economic losses from equipment icing exceed USD 180 billion, with indirect losses being even harder to quantify. Coatings are a highly effective method for preventing equipment from freezing. This paper reviews the research progress of anti&#8208;icing coatings and analyzes future development trends. It evaluates the anti&#8208;icing capabilities of superhydrophobic coatings, slippery liquid&#8208;infused porous surfaces (SLIPS), and energy&#8208;conversion coatings based on their material characteristics and anti&#8208;icing mechanisms. Furthermore, the paper examines the anti&#8208;icing applications of single&#8208;and multifunctional coatings, assesses the advantages and disadvantages of their preparation technologies and material properties, and identifies the main problems in practical applications of current anti&#8208;icing coatings. Finally, it highlights the potential of active anti&#8208;icing functional coatings, particularly energy&#8208;conversion coatings. Through interdisciplinary material innovation and technological exploration, these coatings could enable all&#8208;weather and sustainable anti&#8208;icing solutions.

         <title>Dual Organic Solvents Enable Stable Zn Anodes via Simultaneous Electrolyte Structure and Interface Chemistry Regulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable Zn plating/stripping process can be achieved by simultaneous optimization of bulk electrolyte structures and anode&#8208;electrolyte interfacial chemistry in a hydrous dual organic electrolyte system, using Zn(OTf)2 dissolved in DME and DX.








Abstract
Metallic Zn is an exceptionally promising anode material for aqueous batteries due to its inherent safety, low cost, and high theoretical capacity. However, its widespread application has been severely limited by persistent challenges, including water&#8208;induced parasitic reactions and uncontrolled dendritic growth. Herein, a hydrous dual organic electrolyte system with modulated bulk electrolyte structures and anode&#8208;electrolyte interfacial chemistry has been developed to address the above obstacles, featuring Zn trifluoromethanesulfonate (Zn(OTf)2) dissolved in 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME) and 1,4&#8208;dioxane (DX). In such a system, DME can effectively disrupt the hydrogen bond network of water molecules through its electron&#8208;donating properties, thereby significantly suppressing water activity and associated side reactions, while DX preferentially adsorbs at the anode/electrolyte interface to facilitate Zn2+ desolvation and promote the preferential growth of (002)&#8208;oriented Zn crystals. The optimized electrolyte system endows Zn anodes with exceptional electrochemical performance, demonstrating unprecedented cycling stability (4000 hours at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/1 mAh cm&#8722;2) in the Zn//Zn cell and outstanding Coulombic efficiency (CE) (99.8% over 2000 cycles) in the Zn//Cu cell. Moreover, the full battery paired with Na2V6O16 (NVO)demonstrates excellent cycling stability with 79.0% capacity retention at 5 A g&#8722;1 after 2000 cycles.

         <title>In Situ Construction of RuS2&#8208;MoO3/MoS2 Heterostructure for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution in Alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The RuS2&#8208;MoO3/MoS2 material with enriched heterostructures was successfully prepared through simple hydrothermal and sulfidation approach. This heterostructure enhances the activity of RuS2 for alkaline HER to charged interactions between RuS2 and MoO3/MoS2 with accelerating the rate of water dissociation. It achieves 51 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and Tafel slope of 46 mV dec&#8722;1.








Abstract
The investigation of an electrocatalyst that integrates both high activity and cost&#8208;effectiveness to enhance the sluggish kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) during water reduction constitutes a significant scientific challenge. Herein, we present an electrocatalyst that RuS2 nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed onto MoO3/MoS2 nanosheets support to obtain abundant heterojunction interfaces of RuS2&#8208;MoO3/MoS2 for efficient HER. It enhanced the activity of RuS2 for alkaline HER to charged interactions between RuS2 and MoO3/MoS2 with accelerating the rate of water dissociation and optimizing the reaction kinetics. RuS2&#8208;MoO3/MoS2 heterostructure exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for alkaline HER, showing a low overpotential of only 51&#160;mV at current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a low Tafel slope of 46&#160;mV dec&#8722;1, outperforming commercial Pt/C and most previously reported alkaline HER electrocatalysts. Moreover, it also has outstanding long&#8208;term stability, capable of maintaining current densities of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for durations exceeding 500 hours and 100 hours under the chronoamperometric method, respectively. This research offers novel insights and clear guidance for the development of high&#8208;performance, cost&#8208;effective RuS2 electrocatalysts.

         <title>Selective and Waste&#8208;Free Isolation of High Purity Primary Amines from Amine and Reaction Mixtures by Selective Ammonium Carbamate Crystallization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesizing primary amines either leads to a challenging separation from secondary and tertiary amine side products or a separation of the desired product from a selective homogeneous catalyst. This work presents an efficient isolation strategy based on CO2&#8208;induced waste&#8208;free and reversible salt formation combined with selective crystallization.








Abstract
The isolation of primary amines from secondary and tertiary amines presents a significant challenge in their sustainable production, and existing strategies are either multistep, energy&#8208;demanding, or waste&#8208;intensive. We present an efficient process that utilizes the distinct solubility profiles of ammonium carbamate species formed through waste&#8208;free and reversible salt formation of primary amines and CO2. This selective ammonium carbamate crystallization (SACC) enables the purification of challenging amine mixtures. Starting from 35% initial primary amine purity, SACC achieves very high isolated yields of up to 94% and excellent purities exceeding 99%. Additionally, the separation of secondary from tertiary amines with 86% yield and 91% purity and the fractional crystallization of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines with yields ranging from 83% to 94% and purities from 90% to&#160;&gt;&#160;99% were successfully achieved. SACC was also successfully employed in the alcohol amination with ammonia/ammonia alkylation to isolate primary amines with high yields of up to 84% and excellent purities exceeding 99% using a homogeneous Ru/xantphos catalyst system. The observed average metal and phosphorus losses were at a minimal level of&#160;&lt;&#160;1&#160;wt% of the initial amounts. Based on this high catalyst retention, the additional potential of SACC for recycling the homogeneous catalyst was demonstrated.

         <title>Computational Study on the Relationship between Charge Localization and Second Hyperpolarizability in Mixed&#8208;Valence Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular systems with symmetric resonance structures with invertible polarization (SRIP) have been reported to exhibit negative second hyperpolarizability, which is unusual for ordinal molecular systems. We herein report that mixed&#8208;valance systems can also be recognized as SRIP systems showing negative second hyperpolarizability. Since electronic structures of MV systems are often represented by the Robin&#8211;Day classification, we theoretically investigated the correlation between the Robin&#8211;Day class and second hyperpolarizability &#947; in simple MV systems such as He2&#183;+ and biaryl derivatives. We found that the absolute value of &#947; increases and its sign reverses near the boundary of the Robin&#8211;Day class&#8208;III and II, where the charge begins to localize. The significant validation of &#947; was rationalized by the context of the intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) transitions, which are unique to MV systems. The calculated &#947; for MV systems is more than 100 times larger in absolute value than in the neutral state near the charge localization boundary, and the sign of &#947; switches at the class&#8208;II/III boundary. These results suggest that the nonlinear optical response of materials can be significantly switched by redox stimuli.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid and&#160;Efficient&#160;Solid&#8208;state Mechanosynthesis of Bipyridine Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2,2'&#8208;bipyridine is considered to be the most widely used&#160;ligand and it has been extensively studied especially in the areas of coordination chemistry, medicine, materials and catalysis. A mechanochemical reaction is a process that involves the application of mechanical energy and it provides a high yield in a shorter reaction time and eliminates the need for bulk solvents, typically request in solvothermal reaction.
Notwithstanding the importance of the synthesis of bipyridine&#8208;metal compounds for several decades and recent advancements in the mechanochemical synthesis the development of a mechanochemical protocol for the synthesis of metal complexes bearing bipyridine remains unexplored.
In this work, we extensively studied the mechanochemistry reaction of more than ten metallic precursors of Ru, Ir, Pt, Pd, Fe, and Co with 2,2'&#8208;bipyridine in different stoichiometric ratio without utilization of bulk solvents, under ambient conditions and without air&#8208;sensitive procedures. A comparison of the yield, reaction time, temperature, frequency, green metrics (E&#8208;factor and the Effective Mass Yield (EMY)) of conventional solvothermal methodologies and mechanochemical synthesis clearly indicates that the mechanochemical approach is more sustainable and efficient. Mechanochemistry approach can be complementary to common solvothermal approach, and in the future, it will be required greater attention in the field of organometallic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategies Toward Synthesis and Conversion of Lignin Model Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conversion of lignin toward value&#8208;added products relies on the cleavage of C&#9472;C and C&#9472;O bonding patterns, which has proven to be a difficult task previously, with numerous factors at play. The employment of model compounds which are fashioned on the structure and linkages found within lignin aids in the development of catalytic processes which can then be applied for the scission of linkages within native lignin. This review focuses on the strategies which have been used for the synthesis and conversion of key model compounds of lignin and the products obtained following their breakdown studies.








Abstract
The push toward a renewable society where the chemicals being used on a daily basis come from sources which are not going to be depleted within the next few decades is highly sought after. Biomass is one of the most promising opportunities to establish self&#8208;sustainability for the human race. This review article takes a look at some of the key methods which have been employed for the synthesis of important lignin model compounds, and the synthetic techniques are discussed throughout the first section. The second section of this review is focused on some of the major strategies for the conversion of lignin model compounds throughout the literature. This review serves as a good starting point for someone who is relatively new to the field of lignin model synthesis and valorization.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Planar Chiral Pillar[5]arenes via Dynamic Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric catalytic synthesis via DKR has proven to serve as a powerful tool for the efficient preparation of planar chiral pillar[5]arenes, which allows for achieving high levels of enantioinduction while producing a series of functionalized planar chiral pillar[5]arenes.








Abstract
Pillar[n]arenes are a class of emerging supramolecular macrocyclic hosts that have attracted significant attention due to their intriguing dynamic planar chirality and unique cavity structures. In particular, the conformation of pillar[5]arenes can be locked by the introduction of bulky substituents or &#960;&#8208;conjugated units at both rims, resulting in stable planar chirality. This strategy paves the way for the application of planar chiral pillar[5]arenes as versatile chiral molecular platforms. In recent years, planar chiral pillar[5]arenes have been widely applied in various research fields, such as chiral porous materials, chiral luminescent materials, and molecular machines. However, obtaining planar chiral pillar[5]arenes in enantiomeric forms remains a significant challenge. Recently, asymmetric catalytic synthesis via dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) has proven to serve as a powerful tool for the efficient preparation of planar chiral pillar[5]arenes, which allows for achieving high levels of enantioinduction while producing a series of functionalized planar chiral pillar[5]arenes. This concept summarizes these achievements and highlights the design principles and key challenges, aiming to provide valuable insights for future research.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly Methods Induce Different Individual&#8208;Polymer&#8208;Block Solvation Responses</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different processing methods of the otherwise same block copolymer produce materials that respond distinctly to solvent stimuli. FLIM, which reveals changes in the tightness or looseness of individual blocks, pinpoints these distinct responses to individual&#8208;block behaviors.








Abstract
An understanding of block&#8208;specific responses to stimuli in self&#8208;assembled copolymers is essential for the effective design of responsive materials. Here, materials formed from different post&#8208;reaction processing methods of the same ROMP block copolymer exhibit different block&#8208;specific solvent responses, as characterized in situ by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). FLIM data were acquired by tagging the polar or nonpolar block separately with a covalently incorporated viscosity&#8208;sensitive fluorescent molecular rotor to measure the changing tightness or looseness of assembly upon changes in solvent composition. Rapid precipitation from an insoluble solvent to form a film results in tighter assembly and less difference in tightness/looseness between the two blocks. Further, it interrupts individual block&#8208;solvent response behavior. Both results indicate an apparent disruption of the core&#8211;shell assembly. This model from FLIM is further supported by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) data from isolated solids, which show tighter long&#8208;range interactions and more long&#8208;range order in these kinetically trapped states. The experiments develop FLIM as a method for pinpointing stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviors from different processing methods to individual blocks. Together these outcomes provide a future handle for tailoring solvent&#8208;triggered assembly/disassembly behavior.

The experiments develop FLIM as a method for pinpointing stimuli-responsive behaviors from different processing methods to individual blocks. Together these outcomes provide a future handle for tailoring solvent-triggered assembly/disassembly behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Study on Phosphorus Compound/Catechol&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydrative Amidation and Its Database Development for Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel phosphorus&#8208;based catalytic system for the direct amidation of carboxylic acids with amines has been developed. The efficiency of the phosphorus catalysis is substantially enhanced using catechol derivatives as additives. A vault of experimental data obtained this time was complemented with ML models, which allowed capturing the intricate catalytic behavior in the amidation system.








Abstract
Herein, we report that the catalytic activity of phosphorus compounds with a P&#9472;H bond in dehydrative amidation reactions is substantially enhanced when using catechol derivatives as additives. A systematic investigation into the catalytic activity of four phosphorus compounds and 17 catechol derivatives allowed identifying several effective combinations, for example, dimethyl phosphite and 2,3&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene, for the catalytic amidation of carboxylic acids with amines. The developed catalytic system enables the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and facilitates the amidation of anilines, which are typically considered poor substrates with low reactivity. In addition, machine&#8208;learning (ML) models were constructed to validate the effectiveness of the database generated from the above&#8208;mentioned investigation. Multilayer perceptron (MLP) models incorporating descriptors derived from both quantum chemical calculations and RDKit provided accurate predictions while maintaining chemical interpretability, which was underscored by a visual analysis using SHAP.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Polymer Networks of Silicone Elastomers via Organoborane Lewis&#8208;Pairs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DCPNs with reversible Lewis pair bonds are reported. Nitrogen&#8208;borane adducts impart dynamic mechanical properties, such as self&#8208;healing and recyclability, to polydimethylsiloxane elastomers.








Abstract
Dynamic covalent polymer networks (DCPNs) have been developed in recent years to offer distinctive mechanical properties and shape responsiveness in covalently cured polymer materials, thereby bestowing them with desirable characteristics such as self&#8208;healing and recyclability. To achieve these desirable properties, dynamic polymers incorporate reversible covalent bonds that enable shape morphing without causing irreversible chemical degradation of the network structure. Lewis pairs (LP), forming coordinate covalent bonds, sometimes referred to as dative covalent bonds, exhibit a broad range of bond dissociation rates and energies, making them inherently interesting for designing DCPNs. However, LPs have been relatively unexplored as polymer building blocks. Here, we present a straightforward approach to prepare LP&#8208;based polymers based on archetypical nitrogen&#8208;borane adducts with an organoborane&#8208;functionalized polydimethylsiloxane combined with commercially available Lewis base (LB) polymers. The dynamic behavior of the organoborane&#8208;functionalized system and LB polymers is investigated, demonstrating tunable reversibility in cured elastomers. The excess of LB facilitates rapid recapture and reformation of the covalent network, contributing to the system's reversible and self&#8208;healing nature. Notably, the system allows easy mixing of different LB polymers, enabling the creation of tuning the system, and hence organoborane&#8208;based LPs are demonstrated to be a promising building block for tunable DCPNs.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) represents a promising modality for cancer treatment; however, its clinical application is hindered by challenges such as glutathione (GSH)&#8208;mediated quenching of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and autofluorescence interference during visible light imaging. This study introduces Cy&#8208;NBD&#8208;5F, a photosensitizer engineered to address these limitations. Upon activation by GSH, Cy&#8208;NBD&#8208;5F exhibits 5.5&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement at 701 nm, producing its reduced form, Cy&#8208;OH&#8208;5F, which demonstrates enhanced ROS generation, including a 1.4&#8208;fold increase in singlet oxygen and 1.2&#8208;fold increase in superoxide anion radicals. Under light irradiation, Cy&#8208;OH&#8208;5F induces significant cytotoxicity (IC50 &lt; 3 &#956;M). Additionally, the molecule predominantly localizes within lysosomes and the endoplasmic reticulum, showing organelle&#8208;specific effects to improve therapeutic efficacy. These findings show the potential of Cy&#8208;NBD&#8208;5F as a precise and effective tool for cancer theranostics.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon nanothread (CNTh) is a sp3&#8208;bonded one&#8208;dimensional nanomaterial that was predicted to combine the extreme strength with excellent flexibility. However, the reported CNTh usually has a non&#8208;uniform intrathread structure, and the synthesis of structure&#8208;specific CNTh is still a big challenge. Here, we selecte 1,2,3&#8208;trifluorobenzene (1,2,3&#8208;TFB) with strong dipole as precursor. By compressing 1,2,3&#8208;TFB to 20.1 GPa, a CNTh with a &#8220;zipper polymer&#8221; structure is obtained. Under applied pressure, 1,2,3&#8208;TFB are anti&#8208;parallelly stacked in column, and polymerize via selective sequential [4+2] polymerization between H&#8208;carbon dienophile / F&#8208;carbon dienophile and F, H&#8208;carbon diene within the column, followed by the &#8220;zippered&#8221; bonding of the rest atoms. The obtained CNTh is highly hydrophobic with contact angle of 124.6 &#176;. The excellent columnar anti&#8208;parallel &#960;&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;&#960; stacking and distinct reactivities of carbon atoms introduced by the F&#8208;substitution are responsible for the high reaction selectivity, which provides new insight for the precise synthesis of atom&#8208;level ordered CNThs.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Assemblies of Unsymmetric Pt Complexes with Ag Ions: Two Types of Assembly Modes Depending on the Remote Ancillary Groups in the Bridging Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stepwise clusterization reactions of the (SP&#8208;4&#8208;3) and (SP&#8208;4&#8208;4) Pt complexes with Ag ions are reported. The small structural difference between the two types of Pt complexes was amplified by the hierarchical assembly process, producing different types of &#8220;cluster&#8208;of&#8208;cluster&#8221; aggregates in the crystalline state. The cluster&#8208;of&#8208;cluster complexes exhibited photoluminescence corresponding to the interaction between the Pt2Ag3 unit and Ag ions, whereas each molecular component had similar photophysical properties.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly via noncovalent interactions can amplify small structural differences in small molecular units, producing large supramolecular architectures with structure&#8208;dependent complexity and characteristics. In this paper, the unique self&#8208;assembly behaviors of mononuclear Pt(II) complex units accommodating Ag(I) ions are reported. The Pt complex with the N^C chelating ligand and two different kinds of pyrazole ligands gave two regioisomers, whose structural difference was only the position of the N and C donor atoms in the N^C chelating ligands. This small structural difference influences the assembled structures with Ag ions, producing two different types of heteropolynuclear complexes with different clustering motifs. This was further amplified via a hierarchical assembly process incorporating additional Ag ions to afford two different types of Pt&#8208;Ag cluster&#8208;of&#8208;cluster complexes. This study proves that the self&#8208;assembly of unsymmetrical fragments can endow significant complexity and perturbation in molecular systems, enabling the observation of unique molecular behaviors.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Wheel Movement in a [2]Rotaxane Using a Competing Kinetic Pathway</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In high&#8208;polarity solvent, a [2]rotaxane formed kinetic aggregates showing blue&#8211;purple locally excited emission. The kinetic aggregates gradually transformed into thermodynamic aggregates. During the transformation, the [2]rotaxane was exposed to the aqueous conditions, thus the location of the hydrophilic pillar[5]arene wheel changed, resulting in real&#8208;time monitoring of fluorescence color change from blue&#8211;purple locally excited emission to light&#8208;blue charge&#8211;transfer emission.








Abstract
The wheel movement of rotaxanes is typically fast in solution. Therefore, real&#8208;time monitoring of such movement is one of the challenging topics. Herein, we report real&#8208;time monitoring of wheel movement in a [2]rotaxane (comprising hydrophilic pillar[5]arene as a wheel and hydrophobic &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety with hydrophilic tetra(ethylene oxide) ends as an axle) via a competing kinetic pathway, i.e., aggregation/dissociation equilibrium. In non&#8208;aqueous solvent, the [2]rotaxane shows blue&#8211;purple locally excited emission from the &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety because the pillar[5]arene wheel shuttles over the whole axle. In aqueous solvent, the [2]rotaxane forms aggregates owing to its amphiphilic nature. Because the [2]rotaxane forms the kinetically stable aggregates, the location of the pillar[5]arene wheel on the axle is maintained, resulting in the locally excited emission even in the aqueous conditions. Surprisingly, the emission color gradually changes from blue&#8211;purple to light blue over 720&#160;h because exposure of the monomeric [2]rotaxane generated by dissociation of the kinetically stable aggregates, to the aqueouspola environment triggers movement of the hydrophilic wheel to the hydrophobic &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety by the hydrophobic effect. After this movement, the monomeric [2]rotaxane forms the thermodynamically stable aggregates, which exhibit light&#8208;blue emission from the charge&#8208;transfer complex between the electron&#8208;donating pillar[5]arene wheel and the electron&#8208;accepting &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety.

         <title>From Nanoparticles to Single Crystals of Al&#8208;MOFs: Synergistic Coordination and pH Modulation, and Rapid Sorption Kinetics Assessment by Optical Calorimetry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;throughput studies were carried out to elucidate the synergistic effects of coordination modulation and pH modulation on the crystal size of different Al&#8208;MOFs, resulting in nanoparticles as well as large crystals (dmax&#160;&#8776;&#160;0.1&#160;&#181;m&#160;&#8211;&#160;800&#160;&#181;m). In addition, the influence of particle size on CO2 sorption properties was investigated, showing increasing adsorption and desorption rates with decreasing particle size.








Abstract
The properties of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), such as sorption kinetics or mechanical and chemical stability, not only depend on their composition and chemical structure, but also on their crystal size and morphology. However, the tunability of the crystallite size of aluminum&#8208;based MOFs (Al&#8208;MOFs) is still a long&#8208;standing challenge. In this study, we present systematic high&#8208;throughput investigations elucidating the synergistic effects of different mono&#8208; and dicarboxylic acids (acetic acid, malonic acid, and oxalic acid) as coordination modulators and NaOH as a pH modulator on the crystal size of various Al&#8208;MOFs, with a focus on Al&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;NO2. By varying the type and amount of coordination modulators, we successfully extended the range of achievable particle sizes to nanoparticles as well as large crystals (dmax&#160;&#8776;&#160;100&#160;nm&#160;&#8211;&#160;800&#160;&#181;m) compared to traditional synthesis methods using only coordination modulators. Thus, large crystals as well as nanoparticles of different Al&#8208;MOFs could be obtained by simply varying the molar ratio of the different modulators. Additionally, we explored the influence of particle size on CO2 sorption properties using InfraSORP technology (optical calorimetry), revealing the increase in adsorption rates with decreasing particle size.

         <title>A Tour in the Chemistry of a Tricoordinate Rh(&#8208;I) Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The finding of the unprecedented 16&#8208;e tricoordinate planar rhodium(&#8208;I) complex, K[Rh(IPr)(dvtms)] (K[1]) (IPr = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolyl&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene, dvtms = divinyltretramethyldisiloxane) prompted us to explore its reactivity. K[1] reacts as a nucleophile with methyliodide to give [Rh(IPr)(dvtms)Me], a Rh(I) compound with an exceptional trigonal&#8208;pyramidal structure. Other haloalkanes abstract one electron from K[1] to give the previously reported [Rh0(IPr)(dvtms)] complex. K[1] reacts also with protonic acids and weak proton sources such as water and ketones to give eventually the rare tricoordinate 14&#8208;electron complex [RhI(IPr)(SiMe2OSiMe2CH=CH2)] with a Rh&#8208;Si bond. The 16&#8208;electron complex [RhI(IPr)(SiMe2OSiMe2CH=CH2)(H2C=CH2)] was characterized as an intermediate in this reaction. Furthermore, K[1] runs up to five cycles of catalytic condensation of non&#8208;enolizable aldehydes to esters, such as p&#8208;tolylaldehyde, before being fully converted into the inactive complex Rh(IPr)(&#951;3&#8208;C3H4ptolyl)(C2H4)] with fragmentation of the diolefin dvtms. Computational studies have provided valuable insights into the reactivity patterns and behavior of this complex, including those of the rhodium(&#8208;I)/rhodium(I) catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Orthogonal Photoswitching in Nematic Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoresponsive materials capable of orthogonal and path&#8208;independent switching are crucial for developing adaptive materials and smart technologies. In this work, we showcase a dual light&#8208;responsive nematic liquid crystalline system based on peri&#8208;anthracenethioindigo (PAT) and arylazopyrazole (AAP) doped into the liquid crystal 4&#8208;cyano&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;pentylbiphenyl (5CB). The co&#8208;assembled supramolecular material exhibits a reversible phase transition between the nematic liquid crystalline and isotropic liquid state upon irradiation with different wavelengths of light ranging from ultraviolet to near infrared. These transformations are clearly visible using polarized optical microscopy, displaying either bright or completely dark images depending on the phase state. A key feature of this system is its ability to achieve independent and highly efficient photoisomerization of both photoswitches, ensuring orthogonality and path independence in solution as well as in the liquid crystalline phase. This orthogonal switching capability enables precise and reversible modulation of material properties, allowing sequential interconversion between multiple distinct states. Such a system represents an important proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for future multifunctional materials that leverage light as a non&#8208;invasive external stimulus.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability to control the self&#8208;assembly behavior of functional molecules offers pathways for optimizing their properties and structures for targeted applications. Asymmetric perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives, bearing similar oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) chains and increasing numbers of hydrophobic alkyl chains were used to investigate the effects of hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups on the properties of the resulting supramolecular polymers (SMPs). Tetrahydrofuran/water (THF/H2O) mixtures were found to be an optimal system to induce the self&#8208;assembly behavior of these asymmetric PDI derivatives; the behavior of these new systems was monitored by recording ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV/Vis) spectra and analyzing changes in absorbance intensity. Temperature&#8208;dependent UV/Vis studies yielded thermodynamic parameters for the self&#8208;assembly processes and showed a transition from an isodesmic to a cooperative assembly mechanism with an increase in the number of hydrophobic alkyl chains. Detailed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) investigations revealed the formation of nanofiber&#8208;based supramolecular structures that exhibit a coiling tendency during their assembly process accompanied by the increase in the number (and total volume) of hydrophobic alkyl chains. Exploring these carefully tuned asymmetric PDI systems provides new opportunities to tune not only self&#8208;assembled structures, but also mechanisms of assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of the Substitution Pattern of Terpene&#8208;Based Seven&#8208;Membered Lactones on Yttrium&#8208;Mediated Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization: A Kinetic and Mechanistic Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Terpenes exhibit a wide range of structures, thus enabling diverse applications. Herein, (&#8208;)&#8208;menthide and trans (+)&#8208;carvomenthide were synthesized from terpenoids (&#8208;)&#8208;menthone and (+)&#8208;dihydrocarvone, differing solely in their substitution pattern. (&#8208;)&#8208;Menthide features a methyl group at position 4 and an isopropyl group at position 7, whereas (+)&#8208;carvomenthide shows the inverse arrangement. Both lactones were transformed into polyesters via ring&#8208;opening polymerization using an amino&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;bis(phenolate) yttrium catalyst. Polymerization kinetics revealed first&#8208;order behavior, with (+)&#8208;carvomenthide polymerizing significantly faster than (&#8208;)&#8208;menthide, while (&#8208;)&#8208;menthide demonstrated a more controlled polymerization. Activation energies were 36.3 kJ mol&#8208;1 for (+)&#8208;carvomenthide and 40.8 kJ mol&#8208;1 for (&#8208;)&#8208;menthide. The Gibbs free energy of activation confirmed the lower energy barrier for (+)&#8208;carvomenthide polymerization, with experimental values of 81.9 kJ mol&#8208;1 compared to 89.1 kJ mol&#8208;1 for (&#8208;)&#8208;menthide. DFT calculations supported the experimental results, with computed Gibbs free energy barriers of 84.5 kJ mol&#8208;1 for trans (+)&#8208;carvomenthide and 82.3 kJ mol&#8208;1 for (&#8208;)&#8208;menthide and mechanistic differences. Refined free energy barriers were determined to be 102.1 kJ mol&#8315;1 for (&#8208;)&#8208;menthide and 84.9 kJ mol&#8315;1 for trans (+)&#8208;carvomenthide, agreeing with the experimental trend. These findings highlight the critical role of molecular structure and substituent position on polymerization kinetics and energy barriers in metal&#8208;catalyzed polymerization</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Terpenes exhibit a wide range of structures, thus enabling diverse applications. Herein, (-)-menthide and trans (+)-carvomenthide were synthesized from terpenoids (-)-menthone and (+)-dihydrocarvone, differing solely in their substitution pattern. (-)-Menthide features a methyl group at position 4 and an isopropyl group at position 7, whereas (+)-carvomenthide shows the inverse arrangement. Both lactones were transformed into polyesters via ring-opening polymerization using an amino-alkoxy-bis(phenolate) yttrium catalyst. Polymerization kinetics revealed first-order behavior, with (+)-carvomenthide polymerizing significantly faster than (-)-menthide, while (-)-menthide demonstrated a more controlled polymerization. Activation energies were 36.3 kJ mol-1 for (+)-carvomenthide and 40.8 kJ mol-1 for (-)-menthide.

         <title>BICAAC Supported Germylenes and Stannylenes: Isolation of BICAAC Stabilized Germylone and a Digermanium Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we have disclosed the successful isolation and spectroscopic characterization of a series of bicyclic (alkyl)(amino) carbene (Me/iPrBICAAC) complexes of GeCl2 and SnX2; [MeBICAAC&#8208;GeCl2 (1); iPrBICAAC&#8208;GeCl2 (2); MeBICAAC&#8208;SnX2 (X = Cl (3); X = Br, (4))]. The in&#8208;situ KC8 reduction of GeCl2&#183;dioxane in the presence of MeBICAAC led to the isolation of a zero&#8208;valent di&#8208;coordinated germylone [(MeBICAAC)2Ge] (5), whereas the reduction of adduct 2 afforded a trans&#8208;bent digermanium complex, [iPrBICAAC&#8594;GeGe&#8592;iPrBICAAC] (6), having a GeGe (2.3652(5) &#197; ) double bond. Additionally, complexes 3 and 4 were reacted with diironnonacarbonyl Fe2(CO)9 to produce the corresponding Sn&#8594;Fe adducts 7 and 8, respectively. Further, attempts were made to convert the MeBICAAC&#8208;Sn adducts 3 and 4 to the corresponding tin&#8208;hydride complex, by treatment with LiBH4, however, in both the attempts, uncontrolled hydrogenation occurred to give the dihydrogented MeBICAAC complex, MeBICAAC(H2) (9). The solid&#8208;state structures of compounds 1&#8208;8 have also been elucidated using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction technique. Further, computational investigations were performed to explain the bonding situation in 3&#8208;8 that establishes the ylidone character of 5, and supports the formation of 7&#8208;8 via donation of the lone pair at Sn to the Fe center.</dc:description>

         <title>Mono&#8208; IrIII&#160;versus heterobimetallic IrIII&#8208;AuI&#160;complexes for circularly polarized luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fundamental rationalization of the structural&#8211;circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity relationship is a challenging task. Herein, a pair of enantiopure, heterobimetallic IrIII&#8211;AuI&#160;complexes&#160;IrAu&#8208;4&#160;featuring chirality&#8208;at&#8208;metal is thoroughly investigated by means of spectroscopical and computational techniques, also including spin&#8208;orbital coupling (SOC) effects. Upon resolution of the racemic mixture of the starting chloro&#8208;bridged dimer via a chiral auxiliary ligand, the complexes IrIII&#8211;AuI&#160;are straightforwardly prepared in a stepwise procedure with retention of configuration in good yields. The&#160;IrAu&#8208;4&#160;complexes display moderate orange phosphorescence arising from an admixed metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand and ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MLCT/3LLCT) excited state and good chiroptical activity, as shown by both electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and CPL spectroscopy. A comparison between the parental mononuclear pairs&#160;&#916;&#8208;Ir(ppy)2(acac)&#160;and&#160;&#923;&#8208;Ir(ppy)2(acac)&#160;and the binuclear&#160;IrAu&#8208;4&#160;counterparts also provides interesting insights. The latter possess higher dissymmetry factor (glum) values despite the very similar ECD activity of the lower&#8208;lying&#160;1MLCT band with enantiospecific polarization bias of the light dictated by the chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal configuration. The different nature of the emissive excited state between the two families of complexes and its implication onto the radiative rate constant and the dipolar force is tentatively accounted for the increased CPL&#8208;activity observed in&#160;IrAu&#8208;4.</dc:description>

         <title>Epoxy Resin Patterns Prepared Based on the Photochromism of a Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Mixture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cholesteric liquid crystal polymer network (CLCN) patterns based on polyacrylate have attracted much attention for the applications in decoration and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Although epoxy resin&#8208;based CLCN patterns can be prepared using themochromic cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs), it is hard to prepare them in a large scale on coating lines. Herein, a photochromic CLC mixture was prepared using a reactive epoxy liquid crystal and a photoisomerizable chiral dopant. Driven by the photoisomerization of the chiral dopant, the selective Bragg reflection band of the CLC mixture redshifted with increasing the 365&#8208;nm UV light irradiation time. Due to the high viscosity of the CLC mixture, the reflection band of the irradiated CLC mixture was both time&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent. After photopolymerization, the structural color was fixed. By precisely controlling the annealing time after the photoisomerization of the chiral dopant or the irradiation time for photoisomerization, colorful epoxy resin patterns were prepared, which have potential applications in decoration and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.</dc:description>

         <title>Aryl Shift Rearrangement in Scholl&#8208;Type Reaction Toward Nanographene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Scholl&#8208;type reaction involving both 1,4&#8208;aryl&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;aryl shift rearrangements was discovered, converting a Z&#8208;shaped precursor into nanographene. We establish the principle of the rearrangement mechanism through thermodynamic and kinetic studies using DFT. Our findings indicate that the selection of arenium cation&#8208; or radical cation mechanisms depends on the sizes and positions of the shifting aryl groups.








Abstract
Oxidative dehydrogenation, known as Scholl reaction, is a powerful method for synthesizing many polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Sometimes, unexpected rearrangements can lead to the formation of new structures that are usually difficult to obtain. Here, we discover a novel Scholl&#8208;type reaction involving both 1,4&#8208;aryl&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;aryl shift rearrangements, resulting in the production of armchair nanographene. Additionally, we establish the principle of the rearrangement mechanism through thermodynamic and kinetic studies using density functional theory (DFT). Theoretical studies indicate that the rearrangement reaction involves both arenium cation&#8208; and radical cation mechanisms. The selection of arenium cation&#8208; or radical cation mechanisms depends on the sizes and positions of the shifting aryl groups. Large biphenyl or triphenylenyl groups undergo the arenium cation mechanism, while a small monophenyl group favors the radical cation mechanism. Our findings offer new insights into the controllable rearrangements in Scholl reaction and provide new synthetic methods for obtaining a variety of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are typically challenging to design.

1a and 1f are potent inhibitors of ketolacid reductoisomerase (KARI). 1f has good antituberculosis activity and 1a has herbicidal activity against Brassica campestris and Amaranthus retroflexus.








Abstract
Ketol&#8208;acid reductoisomerase (KARI) is a target for the development of new biocidal agents. This is based on its essential role in branched chain amino acid biosynthesis in plants and microorganisms, and its absence in animals. The lack of success in developing KARI inhibitors as biocides may be because the inhibitors assessed to date compete directly with the substrate, 2&#8208;acetolactate (AL). As a result, effectiveness diminishes when AL accumulates in cells. Furthermore, as these inhibitors are slow binding, an organism could avoid growth slowdown by increasing KARI production. Here, we show a pyrimidinedione, 1f is a competitive but time&#8208;dependent inhibitor of AL and NADPH for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mt) KARI (Ki = 23.3&#160;nM). A crystal structure of this compound bound to the MtKARI homolog from Staphylococcus aureus (Sa), SaKARI, illustrates this dual competition. In contrast, for Oryza sativa KARI, no time&#8208;dependent inhibition by 1f is observed, though it inhibits AL competitively (146&#160;nM) and NADPH uncompetitively. Despite differences in inhibition properties, 1f has an MIC of 12.7&#160;&#181;m for MtH37Rv and inhibits Brassica campestris growth by 63% at 10&#160;mg mL&#8722;1. Therefore, KARI inhibitors that are competitive for NADPH and show no time&#8208;dependent inhibition have excellent potential as biocides.

         <title>Olefin&#8208;Catalyzed Aromatic Bromination toward Biocompatible Tyrosine Modification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocompatible catalysis for aromatic bromination was attained via olefin&#8208;to&#8208;aromatic ring transfer of Br+. Bifunctional cyclooctenes catalyzed the bromination of phenol derivatives, which was applicable in tyrosine modification, and realized light&#8208;gated catalysis. Such olefin catalysis was compatible with aqueous conditions, enabling the bromination of peptides, and the Lewis&#8208;base catalysis of the olefins proceeded even under acidic conditions.








Abstract
The chemical modification of biomolecules is an emerging technique for studying and manipulating biological mechanisms. Among these methods, catalysis offers advantages over stoichiometric strategies due to its ability to enhance selectivity, for example, spatiotemporal control, via catalytic turnover, and the modification of tyrosine recently attracts considerable attention due to its significant biological functions. However, catalyst&#8208;controlled aromatic halogenation is challenging under near&#8208;physiological conditions due to the lack of biocompatible catalysts, despite the potential of tyrosine bromination as an attractive biomolecular labeling technique. In this study, inspired by the bioorthogonal reactivity of cyclic olefins, we developed catalytic aromatic bromination via the transfer of a bromenium ion from olefins to aromatic substrates based on the in&#8208;situ generation of bromiranium ions as active species. Bifunctional cyclooctenes bearing a hydroxybenzyl group efficiently catalyzed the bromination of phenol derivatives, which was applicable in tyrosine modification. The substituent effects of the catalysts primarily affected the rate of the generation of bromiranium ions, which provided the kinetics enabling light&#8208;gated catalysis that could be activated in situ via the photochemical deprotection of the hydroxybenzyl group. Such olefin catalysis was compatible with aqueous conditions, enabling the bromination of peptides, and the Lewis&#8208;base catalysis of the olefins proceeded even under acidic conditions.

         <title>Pulsed Electrolysis Promotes CO2 reduction on Tin Oxide Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The performance of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is determined by multiple factors, including the optimization of catalysts and electrolyser, along with the electrolysis technique. Recently, pulsed electrolysis has been found to tailor the selectivity and prolong the stability of CO2RR on a variety of catalysts, with the most focus on Cu&#8208;based materials. The investigation of pulsed electrolysis on Sn&#8208;based materials remains at early stage. Herein we evaluate the CO2 reduction selectivity of tin oxide electrocatalyst under constant potential electrolysis (CPE) and pulsed potential electrolysis (PPE). Tin oxide achieves higher selectivity toward formate under PPE condition in comparison with CPE. Induced by applied potential, tin oxide catalyst undergoes obvious reconstruction and transform into the composite of Sn&#8208;SnO2 in the process of CO2 reduction under both PPE and CPE conditions. The high selectivity under PPE condition is ascribed to the formation of SnOx on the catalyst surface due to the applied anodic potential.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerating or Slowing: Fine Tuning the De&#8208;threading Kinetics of a T&#8208;Shaped Benzimidazolium Pumping Cassette</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial molecular machines (AMMs) rely on precise control of molecular motion, often enabled by mechanically interpenetrated architectures such as pseudorotaxanes. Here, we systematically investigated a library of [2]pseudorotaxanes formed by the combination of T&#8208;shaped benzimidazolium threads featuring variable stopper sizes and crown ether wheels (24C6, B24C6, and 23C6), to elucidate how structural parameters govern [2]pseudorotaxane stability and de&#8208;threading kinetics. Using ring&#8208;closing metathesis and subsequent hydrogenation, we synthesized ten neutral [2]pseudorotaxanes in high yields (76&#8211;87%). Kinetic studies in DMSO&#8208;d&#8326; at 338 K revealed that de&#8208;threading half&#8208;lives (t&#8321;/&#8322;) span five orders of magnitude, from 0.237 h (3a&#8315;, &#916;G&#8225; = 24.63 kcal/mol) to 436 h (5c&#8315;, &#916;G&#8225; = 31.87 kcal/mol). Notably, stopper enlargement and macrocycle rigidification (e.g., via B24C6) significantly suppressed de&#8208;threading rates; 4d&#8315;, bearing a benzylic phenyl stopper and B24C6, showed a &#916;G&#8225; of 29.04 kcal/mol and a t&#8321;/&#8322; of 168 h. Gas&#8208;phase modeling and NMR analyses further elucidated the roles of stopper geometry and host&#8211;guest interactions in modulating energy barriers. These findings provide design principles for the construction of pseudorotaxane&#8208;based modules, paving the way for programmable molecular pumps and advanced AMMs.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Protein Photo&#8208;Stability Analysis Using SRCD in the Presence of Phospholipid SUVs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of lipid presence on the photostability of proteins was assessed using a synchrotron radiation circular dichroism UV&#8208;denaturation experiment at Diamond B23 beamline. The presence of SUVs preserves the native structure in proteins, particularly in those with a high helical content, suggesting that lipids may play a protective role against light&#8208;induced damage to proteins.








Abstract
The interaction between lipids and proteins impacts a multitude of cellular processes and may contribute to the onset of several pathologies and aging. Such processes are frequently linked to oxidative stress, whereby polyunsaturated fatty acids act as substrates for in vivo lipoxidation. The subsequent lipid peroxidation and/or isomerization is known to affect membrane organization, as well as to modify proteins and DNA, leading to functional alterations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the capacity of UV&#8208;denaturation experiments to induce lipid modification and to investigate the influence of lipid presence on the conformational stability of selected soluble model proteins. The high photon flux and brilliance of the incident beam light of Diamond Light Source B23 for sinchrotron radiation circular dichroism (SRCD) was used to induce protein denaturation. This was acheived by scanning 30 repeated consecutive SRCD spectra in the far&#8208;UV region that, being diagnostic of protein folding, enabled the estimation of the protein photostability. Our findings show that the presence of lipid vesicles (SUVs) significantly impacts the UV denaturation of proteins, preserving the native structure in proteins with a high helical content.

     alt="Enhanced Protein Photo-Stability Analysis Using SRCD in the Presence of Phospholipid SUVs"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The influence of lipid presence on the photostability of proteins was assessed using a synchrotron radiation circular dichroism UV-denaturation experiment at Diamond B23 beamline. The presence of SUVs preserves the native structure in proteins, particularly in those with a high helical content, suggesting that lipids may play a protective role against light-induced damage to proteins.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interaction between lipids and proteins impacts a multitude of cellular processes and may contribute to the onset of several pathologies and aging. Such processes are frequently linked to oxidative stress, whereby polyunsaturated fatty acids act as substrates for in vivo lipoxidation. The subsequent lipid peroxidation and/or isomerization is known to affect membrane organization, as well as to modify proteins and DNA, leading to functional alterations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the capacity of UV-denaturation experiments to induce lipid modification and to investigate the influence of lipid presence on the conformational stability of selected soluble model proteins. The high photon flux and brilliance of the incident beam light of Diamond Light Source B23 for sinchrotron radiation circular dichroism (SRCD) was used to induce protein denaturation. This was acheived by scanning 30 repeated consecutive SRCD spectra in the far-UV region that, being diagnostic of protein folding, enabled the estimation of the protein photostability. Our findings show that the presence of lipid vesicles (SUVs) significantly impacts the UV denaturation of proteins, preserving the native structure in proteins with a high helical content. This suggests that lipids may play a protective role against light-induced damage to proteins.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spectroscopic Interrogation of Thiolate Hydrogen Bonding in the CO Sensor Protein CooA: Implications for Thiolate Ligation Stability and Cytochrome P450 Function</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heme proteins are important biomolecules. Proximal cysteine thiolate ligation is found both in heme enzymes such as cytochromes P450 (CYP) and regulatory proteins such as CooA, a CO sensor. The role of H&#8208;bonding to this cysteine is explored in CooA, including variants, and CYP119 using optical and paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies, which highlight key differences between these two heme systems.









Abstract
Cysteine (Cys) thiolate coordination in hemoproteins is a unique ligation motif found in enzymes and small molecule sensors. It is posited that divergence between these two functional classes of heme thiolate proteins is a result of distinct hydrogen bonding (H&#8208;bonding) interactions with the axial Cys(thiolate) ligand. To further test this hypothesis, we report a spectroscopic analysis of thiolate H&#8208;bonding in CooA, a carbon monoxide&#8208;sensing heme protein from Rhodospirillum rubrum that is known to switch between Cys75(thiolate) and histidine coordination upon reduction. We generated CooA variants with alterations at two residues, Asn42 and His77, which are postulated to influence H&#8208;bonding to Cys75 on the basis of an Fe(II) CooA structure. Using a combination of electronic absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopies, we identified several CooA variants that exhibit changes in thiolate donor strength and propose an H&#8208;bonding model in which Asn42 orients His77 for optimal H&#8208;bonding with Cys75 in Fe(III) CooA. Further, we spectroscopically characterize pyrrolidine&#8208;bound CYP119, a cytochrome P450, to mimic the first coordination sphere of Fe(III) CooA. Our data unequivocally show that CooA contains a stronger thiolate&#8208;Fe bond than the pyrrolidine&#8208;bound CYP119, suggesting that Cys(thiolate) H&#8208;bonding interactions in CooA are significantly weaker. These results support the hypothesis that thiolate H&#8208;bonding is a significant differentiator between the two classes of heme thiolate proteins.

         <title>Exploring the Impact of Phenanthroline&#8208;Based Glycoconjugated Ru(II) Polypyridyl Photosensitizers on Metastasis&#8208;Related Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel family of water&#8208;soluble, nontoxic, and phosphorescent N&#8208;glycosylated Ru(II) phenanthroline&#8208;based complexes are reported. They exhibit photoselectivity indexes ranging from 10 to 44 in PC&#8208;3 cells, while impacting cell migration and resistance to detachment after irradiation with blue light.








Abstract
Novel water&#8208;soluble, phosphorescent ruthenium(II) polypyridyl&#8208;glycoconjugates of general formula [Ru{N&#8208;(1,10&#8208;phenanthroline)}2{N&#8208;(1,10&#8208;phenanthrolin&#8208;5&#8208;yl)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glycopyranosylamine}][Cl]2 (glycopyranosyl&#160;=&#160;D&#8208;glucopyranosyl (1), D&#8208;mannopyranosyl (2), L&#8208;rhamnopyranosyl (3), L&#8208;xylopyranosyl (4), and 2,3,4&#8208;tri&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl&#8208;L&#8208;xylopyranosyl (5)) and corresponding aglycone [Ru{N&#8208;(1,10&#8208;phenanthroline)}2{N&#8208;(1,10&#8208;phenanthrolin&#8208;5&#8208;amine)}][Cl]2 (6) have been synthesized and fully characterized. Their stability and behavior in physiological media have been assessed using ultraviolet visible spectroscopy (UV&#8208;Vis) and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (&#185;H&#8208;NMR), revealing minor N&#8208;glycosidic cleavage and high photostability. The photocytotoxicity of the complexes has been evaluated in two different cancer (PC&#8208;3 and MCF&#8208;7) and one nontumorigenic (HFF&#8208;1) cell lines. While exhibiting no toxicity in the dark, some glycoconjugates achieve photoselectivity indexes of up to 40 upon blue&#8208;light irradiation. Remarkably, complexes 1&#8211;6 potently affect the metastatic phenotype of PC&#8208;3 cells, evidenced by the inhibition of migration in the wound healing assay and the increased resistance to trypsin detachment following photoactivation.

         <dc:description>
The luminescence properties of Sb3+/Er3+&#8208;doped chloride double perovskites Cs2Ag0.4Na0.6InCl6 have been investigated across 250&#8208;1600&#160;nm. Structural and spectroscopic analyses have been performed using XRD, SEM, Raman, XPS, and ToF&#8208;SIMS methods. Energy transfer from Sb3+ to Er3+ enables emission at 525, 552, 665, 805 and&#160;1540&#160;nm.

Abstract
The luminescence properties of stable chloride double perovskites Cs2BIInCl6, where BI is 4 at.% Ag, 6 at.% Na, doped with Sb3+ and Er3+ &#160;were investigated for the first time in the 250&#8208;1600 nm region and revealed significant potential for advanced application. We employed XPS and ToF&#8208;SIMS for chemical analyses, while SEM, XRD, and Raman spectroscopy provided insights into the morphology, crystal structure, and vibrational characteristics of the samples. The crystal structures of Cs2Ag0.292Na0.708InCl6, Cs2Ag0.285Na0.715In0.971Er0.029Cl6, Cs2Ag0.16Na0.84In0.893Er0.017Sb0.09Cl6 were examined using single&#8208;crystal methods. The excited Sb3&#8314; ions emitted blue light at 450&#160;nm due to electronic absorption at sub&#8208;band gap levels, facilitating energy transfer to Er3&#8314; ions. Notably, the Er3&#8314; emitted radiation at 1540&#160;nm, a wavelength particularly useful for optical communication applications. Additionally, emissions at 525&#160;nm, 552&#160;nm, 665&#160;nm, and 805&#160;nm were observed, corresponding to f&#8208;f transitions of Er3&#8314; ions. These compelling results were supported with calculations based on the Modified Crystal Field Theory, explaining the effects of varying concentrations of Sb3&#8314; and Er3&#8314; on the crystal structure and luminescent properties. By using the synthesized materials, we successfully developed an LED prototype that utilized a UV chip (320&#160;nm) combined with the Cs2Ag0.4Na0.6In0.9Er0.01Sb0.09Cl6 powder as a stable and effective luminophore for possible application in optoelectronics.

Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of tris(N,N&#8217;&#8208;di&#8208;isopropyl&#8208;2&#8208;dimethylamido&#8208;guanidinate)molybdenum(III), Mo(iPr&#8208;GND)3 is reported. This complex expands the known scope of tris(guanidinate)M(III) complexes to include Mo, and adds to the very limited knowledge of homoleptic mononuclear Mo(III) coordination complexes. Volatility of Mo(iPr&#8208;GND)3 is demonstrated via thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), hinting at potential applications as a molecular precursor for chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD). Proof of concept aerosol&#8208;assisted CVD growth with Mo(iPr&#8208;GND)3 as a single&#8208;source precursor yielded MoCxNy films. The results indicate a potential utility for Mo(iPr&#8208;GND)3 as a volatile precursor for ALD and CVD, with prospective use as a single&#8208;source precursor for growth of molybdenum nitrides and carbonitrides.

         <title>Engineering of the Thiamine Diphosphate&#8208;Dependent JanthE for the Synthesis of Tertiary Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of chiral tertiary alcohols is in high demand. Here we investigate in detail the aldehyde&#8211;ketone cross&#8208;coupling reactions catalyzed by the promising thiamine diphosphate&#8208;dependent lyase JanthE. Focusing on both reaction parameters and engineering, we rationally develop JanthE to improve its applicability and demonstrate its evolvability and versatility for the enantioselective synthesis of sterically hindered tertiary alcohols.








Abstract
The development of (bio)catalytic methods to chiral tertiary alcohols is in demand, yet the enantioselective synthesis of tertiary alcohols with sterically hindered moieties is problematic. JanthE is a novel thiamine diphosphate&#8208;dependent enzyme that catalyzes aldehyde&#8208;ketone cross&#8208;coupling reactions with a wide range of donor and acceptor substrates. However, product formation is low and precludes large&#8208;scale production. We investigated the conversion of 2&#8208;oxobutanoate and the bulky ketone phenoxy&#8208;2&#8208;propanone to the product 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8208;phenoxypentan&#8208;3&#8208;one as a model reaction for the synthetic capabilities of JanthE. As the reaction design did not significantly improve the yield, we proceeded to rational protein engineering. Docking experiments identified V121, Y268, P293, Y297, and K567 in the active site as important residues for catalysis. Remarkably, the single&#8208;point variant JanthE K567S led to a fivefold increase in product formation (90% ee) compared to the wild type enzyme (93% ee). The reaction was performed at preparative scale proving the direct possibility of application. Additionally, when the reaction was extended to longer 2&#8208;oxopentanoate, the double variant Y297P_K567S showed a 5&#8208;fold increase in product formation compared to the wild type. Our results demonstrate the evolvability and versatility of JanthE for the enantioselective synthesis of sterically hindered tertiary alcohols.

         <title>Non&#8208;C2&#8208;Symmetric Complexant for Minor Actinide Separation of Actinides from Lanthanides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Since initial employment in liquid&#8211;liquid separations for minor actinides (An) from lanthanides (Ln) contained within used nuclear fuel, all previously reported examples of bis&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazinylpyridine (BTP) complexants have been C2 symmetric about the pyridine N axis. Symmetry is postulated to limit solvent access to the polar surface area of complexant topography potentially resulting in low solubility in nonpolar diluents. In this work the unsymmetric BTP, 3&#8208;(6&#8208;(5,6&#8208;bis(3&#8208;butoxyphenyl)&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;5,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazine, a polar molecule, was found to have good solubility in 1&#8208;octanol:kerosene, rapid complexation, high chemoselectivity for 241Am3+ over 154&#8211;152Eu3+, efficient decomplexation without additives, and was recyclable through multiple extractions. Liquid&#8211;liquid extraction, decomplexation, spectroscopic, and DFT calculations are presented.








Abstract
Advancements in the separation of the minor actinides (An) from the neutron&#8208;poisoning post fission lanthanides (Ln) via the partitioning and transmutation strategy are vital toward closure of the nuclear fuel cycle, decreasing dependence on fossil fuels, and minimizing the environmental impact of energy production. Recent advancements in complexant&#8208;based separations strategies have realized substantive gains in ease of synthetic access, process&#8208;relevant diluent solubility, in addition to stability in strongly acidic environments. As purposeful exploration of chemoselective chelating agents moves forward, rapid, selective, and reversible actinide binding are at the forefront. In this work, the utility of a non&#8208;C2&#8208;symmetric, bis&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazinylpyridine (BTP)&#8208;type complexant for the selective extraction of 241Am3+ over 154&#8211;152Eu3+ from simulated high&#8208;level waste is reported. High separation factors (SFs) in 1&#8208;octanol:kerosene 50:50 (v/v), equilibration within 15 minutes of contact time, decomplexation with dilute acid only, and recyclability of a discrete complexant for additional extractions were achieved. Separations, spectroscopic, and DFT calculation data supporting the observed experimental results are disclosed herein.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two new imidazolium&#8208;functionalized resorcinol&#8208;formaldehyde resins RFs were synthesized, using butyl&#8208;methyl imidazolium resorcinate [C1C4Im][Res] as a new precursor or using a post&#8208;functionalization method. During its synthesis, [C1C4Im][Res] spontenaously co&#8208;crystallizes with resorcinol (in a 1 : 1 stoechiometry): the crystal structure shows H&#8208;bonds between resorcinol and resorcinate, and rarely observed &#960;+&#8208;&#960;&#8208; and C&#8208;H&#8208;&#960; interactions between imidazolium ring and resorcinate. New RFs presented substantial decreases of the band gap compared to unmodified RF (from 2.0 eV to 1.72 eV). The use of [C1C4Im][Res] significantly improves particle size uniformity compared to unmodified RF, whereas the post&#8208;functionalization method partially degrades their structure. As RF, the two new resins efficiently catalyse the photodegradation of the methylene blue cation, and the post&#8208;functionalised resin has excellent adsorption properties for this dye.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Insights into Direct Electron Transfer Between FDX1 and Elesclomol&#8208;Cu2+ complex in Cuproptosis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper&#8208;induced cell death, known as cuproptosis, is distinct from other forms of apoptosis. Previous studies have proposed Elesclomol (ES) as a potent cuproptosis inducer, with the mitochondrial ferredoxin protein FDX1 postulated as its primary target. However, the mechanistic details of electron transfer (ET) between Elesclomol&#8208;Cu2+ (ES&#8208;Cu2+) and FDX1 remain elusive, particularly lacking direct spectroscopic evidence. Here, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was employed to characterize the direct ET process between FDX1 and ES&#8208;Cu2+ complexes. Comprehensive low&#8208;temperature EPR measurements validated the efficient ET from reduced FDX1 (FDX1red) to oxidized ES&#8208;Cu2+ complex both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, ES&#8208;Cu2+ complex exhibited a greater propensity for accepting electrons from FDX1 compared to free copper ions (Cu2+), demonstrating the high efficiency of ES&#8208;Cu2+ as a primary electron scavenger for FDX1 in cells.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Copper-induced cell death, known as cuproptosis, is distinct from other forms of apoptosis. Previous studies have proposed Elesclomol (ES) as a potent cuproptosis inducer, with the mitochondrial ferredoxin protein FDX1 postulated as its primary target. However, the mechanistic details of electron transfer (ET) between Elesclomol-Cu2+ (ES-Cu2+) and FDX1 remain elusive, particularly lacking direct spectroscopic evidence. Here, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was employed to characterize the direct ET process between FDX1 and ES-Cu2+ complexes. Comprehensive low-temperature EPR measurements validated the efficient ET from reduced FDX1 (FDX1red) to oxidized ES-Cu2+ complex both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, ES-Cu2+ complex exhibited a greater propensity for accepting electrons from FDX1 compared to free copper ions (Cu2+), demonstrating the high efficiency of ES-Cu2+ as a primary electron scavenger for FDX1 in cells. In addition, EPR power saturation experiments and molecular docking analysis indicated that FDX1 has a much higher binding affinity for ES-Cu2+ than its homologue FDX2, providing crucial insights into the functional specificity between FDX1 and FDX2. This work advances our understanding of ET processes in cuproptosis and underscores the significant potential of EPR spectroscopy in the study of important redox events in cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing Proton Reaction Chemistry of Aqueous Zn&#8211;MnO2 Battery by Phosphate Proton Reservoir</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous rechargeable Zn&#8211;MnO&#8322; batteries have emerged as promising candidates for grid&#8208;scale energy storage due to their low cost, high safety, natural abundance, and high working potential. However, their widespread application is hindered by rapidly capacity degradation and sluggish reaction kinetics. In this study, we introduce Zn&#8323;(PO&#8324;)&#8322;&#183;4H&#8322;O (ZPH) as a proton reservoir to significantly enhance the electrochemical performance of MnO&#8322; by optimizing proton reaction chemistry. Specifically, ZPH stores protons during charging and releases them during discharging, creating a localized H&#8314;&#8208;rich environment that facilitates proton intercalation of Mn&#8308;&#8314;/Mn3&#8314; and the two&#8208;electron transfer reaction of Mn&#8308;+/Mn&#178;&#8314;. Leveraging the proton storage capability of ZPH, the layered MnO&#8322; cathode demonstrates exceptional rate performance (219.2 mA h g&#8722;&#185; at 3 A g&#8722;&#185;), high specific capacity (347.3 mA h g&#8722;&#185; at 0.1 A g&#8722;&#185;), and remarkable cycling performance (1500 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;&#185;). This work provides a scalable and electrolyte&#8208;compatible pathway to optimize proton&#8208;involved reaction dynamics in aqueous Zn&#8211;MnO&#8322; batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;mediated IL&#8208;8 binding to heparan sulfate evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heparan sulfate (HS) interactions with interleukin 8 (IL&#8208;8) are crucial for immune system response. The structural features of the HS and the environmental entities, such as metal ions, can regulate these interactions. However, it is challenging to evaluate the effect of each parameter on the interactions because of low accessibility to well&#8208;defined saccharides and the lack of characteristic features to be determined by analytical tools. We evaluated the effect of the HS structural features on IL&#8208;8 binding affinity utilizing electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. We showed that the metal Ions Ca2+ and Mg2+ dissimilarly mediate the interactions of HS and IL&#8208;8 in structure structure&#8208;dependent manner of the HS. We showed that in all glycans, a positive synergistic effect on IL&#8208;8 binding was observed. For several glycans, the presence of ions resulted in a dramatic increase in the affinity to IL&#8208;8, while for other glycans, a milder effect was observed. This demonstrated that both structural motifs and environmental features are crucial for maintaining the interactions between the HS and IL&#8208;8.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Induced Structural Rearrangement in an M8L2 Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the reversible nature of the metal&#8211;ligand bond, coordination cages are inherently dynamic architectures which can undergo structural transformations upon appropriate external stimulations. This adaptability has been widely explored in various fields. Herein, we report the preparation of a redox&#8208;responsive discrete (Ru2)4L2 architecture through a coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly approach, where Ru2 is a bis(ruthenium(II)) complex and L a tetrapyridyl ligand. Importantly, ligand L is designed around the &#960;&#8208;extended tetrathiafulvalene framework (exTTF), whose geometry is highly sensitive to its redox state. The resulting (Ru2)4L2 assembly was fully characterized revealing a twisted configuration with two orthogonally oriented L units in close spatial proximity. Remarkably, this assembly undergoes an oxidation&#8208;induced transformation into a (Ru2)4Lox2 structure, in which the two dicationic ligands are now spatially separated and aligned according to a face&#8208;to&#8208;face arrangement, affording a cage&#8208;like structure. This reorganization is driven by the redox&#8208;induced geometric and electronic changes of the exTTF cores and the resulting electrostatic repulsions occurring between both oxidized ligands. The process is fully reversible upon chemical reduction, restoring the original (Ru2)4L2 structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Macrocyclic Arenes with Expanded Cavities from Seven&#8208;Membered Ring&#8208;Fused Monomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Numerous macrocyclic arenes have been synthesized from various types of aromatic monomers. However, the rotation of monomer units often reduces the internal cavity volume. To address this issue, seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring&#8208;fused monomers were employed for the synthesis of macrocyclic arenes. The fusion of aromatic units via seven&#8208;membered rings introduces a bent geometry into the macrocyclic framework, which reduces conformational flexibility and helps preserve a stable and expanded internal cavity in both solution and solid states.</dc:description>

We report a Pd/Xantphos&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#9472;P cross&#8208;coupling reaction of aryl thianthrenium salts with a range of organophosphorus compounds, including H&#8208;phosphonate diesters, H&#8208;phosphinate esters, and secondary phosphine oxides.

         <title>Push and Pull: the Impact of Amino and Nitro Substituents on Heteroleptic Cu(I) Photosensitizers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Giving or stealing: Four new heteroleptic Cu(I) complexes containing a nitro or amino group at the 5&#8208;position of the phenanthroline backbone were prepared and systematically studied. The different mesomeric and inductive effects of these substituents have a strong influence on the electrochemical and excited&#8208;state behavior as well as on the photocatalytic activity.








Abstract
This study presents the synthesis and characterization of four novel heteroleptic Cu(I) complexes incorporating nitro&#8208; and amino&#8208;substituted phenanthroline ligands. Their molecular structures, featuring a substituent at the 5&#8208;position of the phenanthroline backbone, were elucidated by X&#8208;ray crystallography and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Spectroscopic and electrochemical investigations revealed distinct mesomeric (M) and inductive (I) effects of the NO&#8322; and NH&#8322; substituents on the photophysical and electronic properties. The electron&#8208;withdrawing NO&#8322; group (&#8208;M, &#8208;I) stabilizes the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), shifts the reduction potential by&#160;+0.9&#160;V and completely quenches emission via nonradiative processes. In contrast, the electron&#8208;donating NH&#8322; group (+M, &#8208;I) induces a moderate redshift (&#8776; 25&#160;nm) in absorption and leads to long&#8208;lived, nonemissive excited states, particularly in CunNH&#8322; (29.1 &#181;s). Photocatalytic tests revealed no hydrogen evolution, but NH&#8322;&#8208;substituted complexes efficiently generated singlet oxygen (&#185;O&#8322;) with quantum yields of up to 39.8%.

     alt="Push and Pull: the Impact of Amino and Nitro Substituents on Heteroleptic Cu(I) Photosensitizers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving or stealing: Four new heteroleptic Cu(I) complexes containing a nitro or amino group at the 5-position of the phenanthroline backbone were prepared and systematically studied. The different mesomeric and inductive effects of these substituents have a strong influence on the electrochemical and excited-state behavior as well as on the photocatalytic activity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study presents the synthesis and characterization of four novel heteroleptic Cu(I) complexes incorporating nitro- and amino-substituted phenanthroline ligands. Their molecular structures, featuring a substituent at the 5-position of the phenanthroline backbone, were elucidated by X-ray crystallography and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Spectroscopic and electrochemical investigations revealed distinct mesomeric (M) and inductive (I) effects of the NO&#8322; and NH&#8322; substituents on the photophysical and electronic properties. The electron-withdrawing NO&#8322; group (-M, -I) stabilizes the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), shifts the reduction potential by&#160;+0.9&#160;V and completely quenches emission via nonradiative processes. In contrast, the electron-donating NH&#8322; group (+M, -I) induces a moderate redshift (&#8776; 25&#160;nm) in absorption and leads to long-lived, nonemissive excited states, particularly in CunNH&#8322; (29.1 &#181;s). Photocatalytic tests revealed no hydrogen evolution, but NH&#8322;-substituted complexes efficiently generated singlet oxygen (&#185;O&#8322;) with quantum yields of up to 39.8%. These findings demonstrate how small structural modifications can fundamentally alter the photophysics and catalytic behavior of Cu(I) complexes, providing valuable design principles for next-generation photosensitizers (PSs).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Investigation of the Degree of Functionalization and Colloidal Stability of Shell&#8208;by&#8208;Shell Functionalized TiO2 Nanoparticles as a Function of Different Phosphonic Acid Chain Lengths</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Shell&#8208;by&#8208;Shell structures of TiO2 nanoparticles, phosphonic acids (PAs) and sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) in their solid and colloidal state were studied by thermogravimetric analysis and analytical ultracentrifugation. This combination showed that agglomerates were formed whose size depended on the PA chain length. This allowed conclusions to be drawn about the efficiency of the overlap between the PA and SDBS.








Abstract
In this work, a series of Shell&#8208;by&#8208;Shell (SbS)&#8208;functionalized colloidal systems consisting of 6&#160;nm TiO2 anatase nanoparticles (NPs), one of the phosphonic acids (PAs) propylphosphonic acid (PAC3), hexylphosphonic acid (PAC6), dodecylphosphonic acid (PAC12), tetradecylphosphonic acid (PAC14), hexadecylphosphonic acid (PAC16), octadecylphosphonic acid (PAC18) and the amphiphile sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) were prepared, resulting in TiO2&#8208;PACX@SDBS (X&#160;=&#160;3, 6, 12, 14, 16, or 18) NPs dispersed in deionized water (DIW). During the whole functionalization process, the NPs were subjected to thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to gain insights into their degree of functionalization and respective thermal stability. In addition, the colloidal stability of the NPs as a function of PA chain length was analyzed by analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC). By combining both TGA and AUC, it was found that the resulting hierarchical NP architectures form agglomerates, with the degree of agglomeration depending on the length of the PA used for the first&#8208;shell functionalization. This allows conclusions to be drawn about the efficiency of the overlap between the PA and the SDBS carbon chains.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Ethylene Methoxycarbonylation Using Bidentate Phosphines: How the Stereochemistry of the Ligand Affects the Catalyst's Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Within the first 50 minutes in Pd&#8208;catalyzed ethylene methoxycarbonylation, racemic pytbpx (B) outperformed meso pytbpx (B) by hindering CO coordination on the Pd&#9472;H complex producing a higher yield (99 vs. 8%), highlighting the enhanced diastereomeric effect, while dtbpx (A) exhibited the highest methanolysis energy barrier and the lowest activity (2%), emphasizing the significant built&#8208;in base effect in pytbpx (B).








Abstract
To elucidate the diastereomeric control of bidentate P&#8208;ligands in the ethylene methoxycarbonylation, a comparative and systematic experimental and computational investigation was conducted on the catalytic activity of the Pd&#8208;complexes of the racemic, meso, and epimerized LIKATphos ligands (pytbpx, B) as well as the Lucite ligand (dtbpx, A). The experimental study revealed that the racemic ligand (pytbpx, B) exhibited the highest catalytic activity, while the Lucite ligand (dtbpx, A) exhibited the lowest activity, and the meso ligand (pytbpx, B) exhibited moderate activity. This activity order follows the same trend as the CO coordination energy to the palladium hydride complex for B, while the methanolysis is the rate&#8208;limiting step with A. The enhanced catalytic activity exhibited by the chiral pytbpx (B) is attributed to the higher stability of the hydride complex and lower stability of the CO complex compared to the meso pytbpx (B). The higher activity of the Pd&#8208;complexes of pytbpx (B) over the Pd&#8208;complexes of dtbpx (A) is attributed to the built&#8208;in base effect.

         <title>Reversible Photocyclization of Imidazoleisoindole&#8208;Based Stilbene Derivative Apparently over NonTriene Form</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imidazoleisoindole&#8208;based stilbene analogue undergoes E&#8211;Z photoisomerization and unusual photocyclization over a formal nontriene C&#9552;C&#9472;C&#9552;C&#9472;C&#9472;N structure, which is rationally supported by X&#8208;ray and DFT&#8208;based analyses. The photochemical quantum yields over 0.3 is observed for the cyclization reaction. While the hexatriene structure is assumed as a minor mesomeric form, the ground state HOMO/LUMO symmetry resembles usual diarylethenes and satisfies Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann rules for photocyclization.








Abstract
Diarylethene is one of the most extensively studied photochromic compounds due to its remarkable properties. Recently, nitrogen&#8208;based diarylethenes (DAEs) have been reported to exhibit unusual photochromic behavior. In this study, we synthesized an imidazoleisoindole&#8208;based stilbene analogue, which involves a neutral C&#9552;C&#9472;C&#9552;C&#9472;C&#9472;N framework, along with a C&#9552;C&#9472;C&#9552;C&#9472;C&#9552;N form as a minor mesomeric form. Crystal structural analysis supported the major contribution of the former form. Surprisingly, the molecule exhibited not only E&#8211;Z photoisomerization but also the photocyclization reaction with a quantum yield of 0.3. The orbital symmetry of the HOMO and LUMO around the reactive center closely resembled to that of typical DAEs and satisfied the Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann rules. Imidazolium analogue is also studied for comparison. The imidazoleisoindole&#8208;based stilbene analogue represents a novel and unusual example of photocyclization in DAEs, uncovering the importance of the symmetric feature of LUMO and HOMO around the reactive center for the photocyclization.

         <title>Oligomeric Protein Complexes Formed by Beta Amyloid Peptides and Their Molecular Associates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
RMs stabilize oligomeric A&#946; and facilitate protein complex formation with Zn2&#8314; and TDP&#8208;43. In contrast to bulk solution, where homotypic interactions dominate, the confined environment promotes prolonged interactions of A&#946; with molecular associates, enabling structural investigations using solid&#8208;state NMR.








Abstract
The aggregation and dysregulation of &#946;&#8208;amyloid (A&#946;) peptides are critical factors in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study investigates the use of reverse micelles (RMs) as a nanoscale environment to encapsulate A&#946; peptides and explore their interactions with zinc ions (Zn2&#8314;) and a TDP&#8208;43 variant, both of which are important binding partners of A&#946; peptides closely associated with neurodegenerative diseases. We demonstrate that RMs stabilize A&#946; peptides in their oligomeric form, promoting &#946;&#8208;sheet formation and enabling detailed structural studies using solid&#8208;state NMR. Our findings reveal that Zn2&#8314; induces specific conformational changes in residues E11 and E22 of A&#946; oligomers but not E3, and that the TDP&#8208;43 variant can form stable protein complex with A&#946;40, that persists even after extended incubation and sonication. A systematic comparison of the site&#8208;specific 13C chemical shifts of the A&#946;40 oligomers modulated by the interactions with Zn2&#8314;, A&#946;42, and a TDP&#8208;43 variant, revealed that A&#946;40 predominantly adopts a &#946;1&#8208;loop&#8208;&#946;2 motif. Notably, chemical state changes were mainly observed in the residues within the loop region and the charged residues of the &#946;1 region.

&lt;p&gt;RMs stabilize oligomeric A&#946; and facilitate protein complex formation with Zn&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314; and TDP-43. In contrast to bulk solution, where homotypic interactions dominate, the confined environment promotes prolonged interactions of A&#946; with molecular associates, enabling structural investigations using solid-state NMR.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aggregation and dysregulation of &#946;-amyloid (A&#946;) peptides are critical factors in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study investigates the use of reverse micelles (RMs) as a nanoscale environment to encapsulate A&#946; peptides and explore their interactions with zinc ions (Zn&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314;) and a TDP-43 variant, both of which are important binding partners of A&#946; peptides closely associated with neurodegenerative diseases. We demonstrate that RMs stabilize A&#946; peptides in their oligomeric form, promoting &#946;-sheet formation and enabling detailed structural studies using solid-state NMR. Our findings reveal that Zn&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314; induces specific conformational changes in residues E11 and E22 of A&#946; oligomers but not E3, and that the TDP-43 variant can form stable protein complex with A&#946;&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;, that persists even after extended incubation and sonication. A systematic comparison of the site-specific &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C chemical shifts of the A&#946;&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; oligomers modulated by the interactions with Zn&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314;, A&#946;&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;, and a TDP-43 variant, revealed that A&#946;&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; predominantly adopts a &#946;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-loop-&#946;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; motif. Notably, chemical state changes were mainly observed in the residues within the loop region and the charged residues of the &#946;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; region. In contrast, the hydrophobic residues of the &#946;-sheet regions were structurally unaltered upon protein complex formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>S&#8208;Containing Double Helicenes Featuring Robust Radical Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces two S&#8208;containing double helicenes with robust radical cations. X&#8208;ray crystallography shows twisted conformations matching DFT&#8208;calculated minima. Chemical oxidation of these double helicenes produced &#960;&#8208;conjugated radical cations, which remained stable in solution for weeks. Remarkably, one radical cation salt achieves a room&#8208;temperature electrical conductivity as high as 0.16 S cm&#8722;1 due to the significant &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions.








Abstract
This study introduces two S&#8208;containing double helicenes capable of forming robust radical cations. These compounds were synthesized via the Scholl reaction, which was modulated to an intermediate stage by reducing the amount of oxidant, resulting in a sulfur&#8208;containing [7]helicene. X&#8208;ray crystallography analysis reveals that both S&#8208;containing double helicenes exhibit twisted conformations consistent with the global minima identified through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Upon chemical oxidation with nitrosonium, these double helicenes produced &#960;&#8208;conjugated radical cations, whose radical nature was confirmed using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. These radical cations remained stable in solution when exposed to air for several weeks, as monitored with absorption spectroscopy. One of the double helicenes forms &#960;&#8208;stacked columns in the crystals of both neutral molecule and radical cation salt. The radical cation hexafluoroantimonate salt exhibits a room&#8208;temperature conductivity of up to 0.16 S cm&#8722;1, attributed to the significant &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions observed in its crystal structure. This study indicates the potential of double helical &#960;&#8208;skeletons as a versatile platform for developing resilient &#960;&#8208;conjugated radical cations without compromising &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, with potential applications in organic electronics.

         <title>Balancing Antigen Loading on Gold Nanoparticles: Implications for Future Cancer Vaccine Strategies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of multicomponent cancer vaccines on AuNP carriers could be rationalized by the simultaneous functionalization of the antigen and immunomodulator components on the same particles. Immunization with a &#8220;diluted&#8221; amount of MUC1&#8208;functionalized AuNPs is still capable of eliciting a strong immune response. Immunohistochemical studies of breast cancer tissue showed that the elicited antibodies were specifically directed against tumour&#8208;associated MUC1&#8208;expressing cells and promoted antibody&#8208;dependent cell&#8208;mediated cytotoxicity.








Abstract
Mucin 1 (MUC1) is a promising antigen for cancer vaccine development, but its low immunogenicity poses a major challenge. In this study, we have investigated the effect of varying the surface density of an artificial MUC1 glycopeptide on gold nanoparticles by co&#8208;loading them with an ovalbumin&#8208;derived peptide. Our results show that reducing the density of the MUC1 antigen on the nanoparticles does not affect the elicited immune response, as high IgG antibody levels were observed in the immunized mice, which were comparable to those obtained with higher antigen loading. These antibodies effectively reacted with natural MUC1 expressed on breast cancer cells, promoted antibody&#8208;dependent cell&#8208;mediated cytotoxicity and specifically recognized cancer tissue in immunohistochemical assays. This work could form the basis for the development of AuNP&#8208;based multicomponent vaccines that will allow the incorporation of additional immunostimulatory or complementary antigens in the future without compromising the efficacy of the MUC1 antigen.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The difluoromethylene (CF&#8322;) group, valued for its unique electronic and steric properties, plays a critical role in pharmaceutical and agrochemical design, as exemplified by drugs like Lubiprostone, which requires ethyl 2,2&#8208;difluorohexanoate as a key intermediate for its synthesis. Consequently, developing efficient methods to incorporate the ethoxycarbonyldifluoromethyl group into alkanes is highly desirable. Herein, we describe a mild, versatile, and efficient radical hydro&#8208;ethoxycarbonyldifluoromethylation of alkenes with BrCF2CO2Et. This process is applicable to both unactivated alkyl alkenes and active aryl alkenes. The protocol is characterized by mild reaction conditions, the absence of expensive reagents, and the elimination of transition metals.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Helical Metallocryptand for Size&#8208;Selective Recognition of Amino Acid Derivatives with Aliphatic Side Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel tris(salen)&#8208;type metallocryptand, LNi3, was synthesized, which was found to exist as a pair of P/M helical enantiomers. This LNi3 selectively recognized various amino acid derivatives via non&#8208;covalent interactions, showing a selectivity to those bearing an aliphatic side chain. The LNi3 metallocryptand also exhibited unique P/M helix inversion preferences depending on the guest side chains, offering potential applications in biochemical sensing and enantioselective detection.








Abstract
The novel tris(salen)&#8208;type metallocryptand, LNi3, was designed and synthesized. Its crystallographic analysis revealed the presence as a helical enantiomeric pair, right&#8208;handed (P) and left&#8208;handed (M) forms, rather than the meso form, which was energetically supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This LNi3 host was capable of recognizing amino acid derivatives by several non&#8208;covalent interactions, showing a selectivity to those bearing an aliphatic side chain. Its shape&#8208;persistent nature of the cryptand facilitated the size&#8208;based discrimination, which was clearly demonstrated by 1H NMR spectroscopic titration studies. Recognition of some of the guests caused the emergence of CD signals, indicating the biased P/M helix inversion equilibrium of LNi3. Three aliphatic side&#8208;chain guests, Val, Ile, and Leu, caused an M&#8208;favored shifting, while two &#960;&#8208;containing side&#8208;chain guests, Arg and Trp, showed a preference to the P form. This metallocryptand, LNi3, overcomes the limitation in recognition of less polar amino acids having an alkyl side chain and provides future applications in molecular recognition, biochemical sensing, and enantiomeric sensing.

AlH3&#183;(NMP)x complexes with varying coordination numbers were synthesized. AlH3&#183;(NMP)1.0 single crystals were isolated from AlH3&#183;(NMP)x mixtures, and successfully elucidated the structure of AlH3&#183;(NMP)1.0 through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The coordination number of AlH3&#183;(NMP)x modulates the morphology of Al nanoparticles. AlH3&#183;(NMP)1.0 exhibited the fastest decomposition rate, yielding highly monodisperse Aluminum nanoparticles (Al NPs) with well&#8208;defined shapes and the narrowest size distribution.








Abstract
The controlled chemical synthesis of aluminum nanocrystals (Al NCs) is crucial for their applications in plasmonics, photocatalysis, and optoelectronics. However, there is still a lack of correlation between the precursor of Al hydride N&#8208;methylpyrrolidine (AlH3&#183;(NMP)x) and the Al NC synthesis outcomes. Here, we report the synthesis of AlH3&#183;(NMP)x complexes with different coordination numbers (x from 1.0 to 2.0) and their characterization as precursors regulating the morphology of Al NCs. We isolated AlH3&#183;(NMP)1.0 single crystals from AlH3&#183;(NMP)x mixtures and successfully elucidated the structure of AlH3&#183;(NMP)1.0 through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Importantly, AlH3&#183;(NMP)1.0 exhibited the fastest decomposition rate, yielding highly monodisperse Al NCs with well&#8208;defined shapes and the narrowest size distribution, while higher coordination numbers led to increased dispersity in size and irregular morphologies. Additionally, we observed distinct multipole plasmonic resonances in Al NCs synthesized from lower coordination number precursors, highlighting their superior optical properties. This work establishes a direct correlation between precursor coordination chemistry and Al NC synthesis outcomes, providing a foundation for optimizing nanoparticle production for advanced material applications.

         <title>Enhanced Polysulfide Regulation in Rechargeable Li&#8211;S Batteries with ZnS as Electrocatalyst: Experimental Validation and Interfacial Insights from Simulations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ZnS&#8208;decorated reduced graphene oxide (rGO@ZnS) composite has been developed as a multifunctional host for the sulfur cathode in rechargeable Li&#8211;S batteries. The host exhibits excellent polysulfides adsorption and catalytic conversion during the battery cycling. The experimental results are verified with molecular dynamics simulations, revealing the role of ZnS in accelerating polysulfide conversion kinetics.








Abstract
We present a high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery cathode based on a reduced graphene oxide (rGO)&#8208;decorated ZnS nanosphere structure, which serves as a multifunctional sulfur host. The rGO framework provides a high&#8208;surface&#8208;area conductive network for enhanced sulfur loading, while ZnS acts as an electrocatalyst to accelerate polysulfide conversion. Fabricated via a one&#8208;step hydrothermal method, the composite achieves a high sulfur content (&#8764;80%) with efficient polysulfide confinement and catalytic conversion as an Li&#8211;S battery cathode. As a result, it delivers an initial capacity of 1014 mAh/g at 0.1 C and retains 592 mAh/g at 1C, demonstrating excellent rate capability and cycling stability (479 mAh/g over 200 cycles at 1C). To further understand the interfacial interactions, molecular dynamics simulations were conducted, revealing the role of ZnS in accelerating lithium polysulfide (LiPS) conversion, particularly from Li&#8322;S&#8324; to Li&#8322;S. The study analyzed LiPS diffusion coefficients and potential energy across different sulfur species, confirming the superior efficiency of the rGO@ZnS host. These findings highlight the potential of ZnS&#8208;decorated rGO structures as a promising approach to improving Li&#8211;S battery performance through enhanced sulfur utilization and polysulfide regulation.

         <title>Modulating Peptide Self&#8208;Assembly via Triblock Chiral Patterning</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral block patterning influences peptide self&#8208;assembly by directing molecular orientation, which results in distinct morphologies and packing configurations. This alters the gel's mechanical properties, thereby impacting its applications in tissue engineering and drug delivery. Our research shows that integrating chiral motifs can modify peptide nanostructures, providing flexible strategies for tailoring functional biomaterials.








Abstract
The suprastructural integrity of peptide self&#8208;assemblies is driven by an intricate array of cohesive interactions that guide and maintain a hierarchical order. Seemingly minor alterations to atomic arrangement, such as substitution with D&#8208;amino acids, can dramatically affect assembly potential and resultant architecture. When a primary sequence is comprised of consecutive identical motifs, &#8220;block heterochiral&#8221; peptides can be generated by partitioning chiral inversions according to these underlying elementary units. In this work, we present a combinatorial exploration of all triblock chiral patterns for the model &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;forming peptide KFE12 (Ac&#8208;(FKFE)3&#8208;NH2). Analysis of the four resulting enantiomer pairs reveals that each produces a unique morphology, ranging from minimal 4&#8208;nm&#8208;wide fibrils to micron&#8208;scale semi&#8208;structured aggregates. Our investigation of these variants illustrates a combination of conserved and divergent hierarchical features, reflecting complex interplay between persistent fundamental forces and the unique spatial implications of blockwise intramolecular chiral interfaces.

         <title>Reactivity of &#948;&#8208;Functionalized para&#8208;Quinone Methides in Nucleophilic Addition Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrophilic reactivities of para&#8208;quinone methides (pQMs) with functional groups at the exocyclic polarized carbon&#8208;carbon double bond were determined by photometrical monitoring the kinetics of their reactions with carbanions in DMSO at 20&#176;C. The experimental second&#8208;order rate constants k2 were evaluated by the Mayr&#8208;Patz equation, that is, the linear free energy relationship lg k2 = sN(N + E), which was leveraged to determine the electrophilicity descriptors E of the pQMs. These electrophilicity parameters E were subsequently used to successfully predict the scope of the pQM reactions with C&#8208;, H&#8208;, N&#8208;, O&#8208; and S&#8208;centered nucleophiles. Moreover, the electrophilicity parameters E correlate linearly with a linear combination of quantum&#8208;chemically calculated methyl anion affinities (MAAs) and buried volumes (%Vbur). While MAA values mainly reflect the thermodynamic driving force of the carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation, %Vbur values take account of the variable steric effects of substituents at the electrophilic &#948;&#8208;position of the pQMs. Knowledge of MAA and %Vbur thus enables chemists to tailor novel pQMs with predictable reactivity properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrodeposition of PTCTA/ZnO Composite Films for Acetic Acid Vapor Detection at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents PTCTA/ZnO composite films for efficient room&#8208;temperature acetic acid sensing. The enhanced sensing capability was attributed to the synergistic effects of the formation of p&#8208;n heterojunction effect and the porous structure of PTCTA/ZnO composite.








Abstract
Metal oxide semiconductor sensors based on zinc oxide (ZnO) and its composites are found to be very sensitive in detecting acetic acid vapor. However, its operating temperatures usually exceed 200&#160;&#176;C. In this work, an environmentally friendly and controllable electrochemical approach for constructing poly(4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;&#8208;Tris(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;triphenylamine) (PTCTA) and ZnO composite films was successfully obtained for acetic acid sensing at room temperature. The conjugated microporous polymer (CMP) films of PTCTA were synthesized via an electropolymerization (EP) method using 4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;&#8208;Tris(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;triphenylamine (TCTA) molecule as a precursor. Subsequently, ZnO was deposited in situ to fabricate homogeneous PTCTA/ZnO composite films. The resulting PTCTA/ZnO composite films achieved a response value of 2.42 for 200&#160;ppm acetic acid vapor at room temperature, which was significantly outperforming standalone PTCTA or ZnO films. This enhanced sensing capability was attributed to the porous structure, the synergistic effects of the p&#8208;n heterojunction at the PTCTA/ZnO interface and the oxygen adsorption/desorption occurring on the ZnO surface. What's more, PTCTA/ZnO composite films demonstrated structural stability and flexibility. The results suggested that the developed novel PTCTA/ZnO composite films showed great potential for acetic acid determination.

         <title>Convergent approach towards ADP&#8208;ribosylated&#8208;peptides via a chemoselective phosphate condensation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The preparation of well&#8208;defined ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides is essential for studying the functional implications of this post&#8208;translational modification. While methodologies exist for the chemical synthesis of short oligo&#8208;ADPr fragments and mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides separately, combining the two distinct chemistries, required to assemble them, has remained challenging. In this research, we employ a methodology for the regio&#8208; and chemoselective condensation of two phosphomonoesters to convergently install the pyrophosphate bond in ADP&#8208;ribosylated constructs. A diverse set of phosphoribosylated peptides, varying in the amino acid acceptor, were prepared and condensed with adenosine monophosphate to yield mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides. Furthermore, a solid&#8208;phase approach was developed to access a phosphoadenosyl&#8208;ADPr fragment, which was used to prepare a di&#8208;ADPr&#8208;peptide as the first example of a synthetic oligo&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptide. Overall, the work presented here extends synthetic methodology for the preparation of well&#8208;defined ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Importance of Balancing the pKa of the Additive in &#946;&#8208;Ketoenamine COF Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the irreversible tautomerization of imine linkages to their corresponding ketoenamines, &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) are a stable type of COF that displays high surface areas. In the solvothermal synthesis of such COFs, the use of (acetic) acid is ubiquitous. However, the effect of the added acid on the COF properties (notably their surface area) has never been investigated. Building on an extensive literature overview, we systematically studied the effect of the pKa of several added acids on COF performance characteristics, and extended the investigation by including a series of (organo&#8208;)bases with varying pKa. Interestingly, the highest BET surface areas, above 1400 m2/g, were found in the alkaline region of the pKa window, with a maximum near pKa ~10.8 for triethylamine and N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine. Considering the pKa values related to the three phenolic hydroxyl groups of 2,4,6&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol, one of the COF building blocks, these organobases fully deprotonate two of these hydroxyl groups and partly deprotonate the third one, which will optimize the reaction rate of the &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine bond formation, explaining the improved COF crystallinity and associated microporosity. The largely overlooked use of organobases in the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked COFs thus offers a promising approach to improve the COF performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Aggregation, Photoluminescence, and Cytotoxicity of Pt(II) and Re(I) Complexes Bearing Multimodal&#8208;Coordinating Luminophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polydentate ligand with multiple coordination patterns (bidentate N*N&#8208;mode for Pt(II) and Re(I) centers, tridentate C^N*N&#8208;motive for Pt(II)&#8208;based complexes) is herein presented. The attained coordination&#8208;chemical versatility in combination with different co&#8208;ligands was employed to achieve sophisticated structural features and tunable photophysical properties, including&#160;aggregation and cytotoxicity.








Abstract
In this study, a polydentate ligand capable of adopting multiple coordination modes (N*N, C^N*N, and C^N*N^C) was established. Depending on the chelation conditions and the co&#8208;ligand used in the subsequent steps, nine complexes became accessible. The four Pt(II)&#8208;based species with N*N&#8208;coordination motif show tunable emission and cytotoxicity. Two Pt(II) complexes with C^N*N&#8208;type coordination were also obtained, and the exchange of the co&#8208;ligand from chlorido to cyanido led to an enhancement in the photoluminescence quantum yield from &lt;0.02 to 0.55. These compounds exhibit distinct solid&#8208;state characteristics associated with Pt&#8943;Pt&#8208;interactions. Interestingly, the tetradentate C^N*N^C&#8208;coordination mode was not accessible, most likely due to kinetic reasons and insolubility&#8208;related purification hurdles. However, the use of a N*N&#8208;coordination mode for a Re(I) center yielded non&#8208;cytotoxic 3MLCT&#8208;state emitters. The multifaceted coordination modes available with the luminophoric ligand enable the design and realization of diverse metal complexes with tailored cytotoxicity and tendency towards intermolecular coupling, both in solution and in crystalline phases.

         <title>Effect of the Entanglement of Microporous Pillared MOFs on the Uptake and Release Profiles of Essential Oil Components</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two differently entangled pillared MOFs with similar chemical compositions but different flexibility were compared for their guest uptake/release capacity. The flexible interpenetrated MOF shows superior host&#8208;guest propensity with respect to the polycatenated one.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of coordination polymers known for their intrinsic porosity. This property, combined with their ability to exhibit some degree of flexibility, makes them ideal materials for various innovative applications, like the inclusion and controlled release of active compounds for active packaging and agricultural applications. This study aimed to characterize the uptake and release behavior of an equimolar mixture of two phenolic essential oils (EOs), that is, carvacrol (CAR) and thymol (THY), encapsulated in two microporous Zn&#8208;based MOFs with different entanglement motifs: PUM168 is threefold interpenetrated and flexible, while PUM210 is fourfold polycatenated and rigid (PUM = Parma University Materials). The guest uptake was calculated using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) analysis, whereas the release profiles were investigated via headspace gas chromatography&#8208;mass spectrometry (HS&#8208;GC&#8208;MS) (Headspace&#8208;Gas Chromatography coupled with Mass&#8208;Spectrometry) analysis over a period of 15 days at room temperature. The monitoring revealed the superior ability of the flexible PUM168 for a stable and prolonged release of the volatile components, while the release from the rigid PUM210 was completed within 24 hours.

         <title>Small Molecule Donor/Polymer Acceptor Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency of 13.65% Enabled by Film Formation Kinetics and Phase Separation Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on small molecular donor and polymer acceptor (SD/PA&#8208;type) show low photovoltaic performance due to the unideal morphology. However, previous work mainly focus on the aspects of donors, but how the polymer acceptor influences its morphology and device performances is lack of study. In this work, we apply three polymerized non&#8208;fullerene small molecules as acceptors, combining film forming kinetics and microstructure characterization to investigate the efficient SD/PA&#8208;type OSCs requirements on polymers. We found the following two results: Strong miscibility between donor and acceptor would facilitate the acceptor induce the donor to adopt a face&#8208;on packing; under the similar miscibility, the inferior crystallinity of acceptor facilitates a more proper phase separation. Hence, the DTBDT&#8208;C3&#8208;D6:PY2S&#8208;F&#8208;based SD/PA&#8208;type OSCs with the best miscibility achieves an impressive PCE of 13.65% with both high short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) of 20.73 mA cm&#8208;2&#160;and fill factor (FF) of 72.93%, which are among the highest values in the reported binary SD/PA&#8208;type OSCs so far. Our work provides a new perspective for the development of highly efficient SD/PA&#8208;type OSCs with polymer acceptor matched to small molecule donor.</dc:description>

         <title>Secondary Donor Engineering for High&#8208;Efficiency Orange&#8208;Red Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Secondary donor positional engineering at the C2 and C3 positions of a NAI&#8211;DMAc core yields efficient orange&#8209;red TADF emitters. The C3&#8209;isomer ND37DBT exhibits enhanced spin orbit coupling and RISC processes, achieving 70% PLQY. and 22.1% EQE in solution&#8209;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs).








Abstract
Achieving efficient orange&#8208;red emission in thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters remains challenging due to the hard to achieve great balance between a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap and high radiative decay rates. In this study, a modification site engineering strategy for secondary donors to optimize excited&#8208;state properties for orange&#8208;red emitters is proposed. Two isomeric emitters, ND28DBT and ND37DBT, were synthesized by introducing dibenzothiophene (DBT) units at different positions of a naphthalimide&#8211;dimethylacridine (NAI&#8211;DMAc) core. The theoretical analysis indicates that ND37DBT possesses a more favorable excited&#8208;state configuration, which facilitates an efficient reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process and accelerates the radiative decay rate. As a result, ND37DBT showed a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) (70%), a fast RISC rate (6.25&#160;&#215;&#160;105 s&#8722;1), and an excellent external quantum efficiency (EQE) (22.1%) with minimal roll&#8208;off in 100 cd m&#8722;2. This work demonstrates that precise control of secondary donor modification sites offers a powerful molecular design strategy for developing high&#8208;efficiency orange&#8208;red TADF materials.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of Triphosphaallyl Cation Stabilized by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>

Imidazoliumyl&#8208;substituted triphosphaallyl cations undergo selective P&#8211;C bond cleavage and form unprecedented bicyclic P&#8323;&#8208;Ga scaffolds with unique reactivity.









Abstract
Reduction of the triphosphaallyl species 6[GaCl4] with GaI[Ga2Cl7] affords the imidazoliumyl&#8208;substituted (L) bicyclo[2.1.1]&#8208;triphosphane 10[Ga2Cl7], featuring an unprecedented Ga2Cl5&#8208;bridged P3 scaffold. Reactions of 10[Ga2Cl7] with nucleophiles (Cl&#8722; or NHC) result in rare, selective P&#8211;C bond cleavages, affording Ga2Cly&#8208;substituted triphosphiranes (LP3Ga2Cly, y = &#160;5, 6) via an intramolecular ring closure mechanism. Protonation of 6[GaCl4] gives rise to a similar ring closure, but without P&#8211;C bond cleavage, to afford the L2P3H+ salt 8[OTfGaCl3]2. Additionally, the palladium complex 26[GaCl4], formed through the reaction of 10[Ga2Cl7] with [Pd(PPh3)4], presents a novel bicyclic P3Pd moiety (LP3Pd(PPh3)2[GaCl4]). Comprehensive DFT calculations have been conducted to elucidate the bonding situation in 26[GaCl4], uncovering significant metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand &#960;&#8208;back&#8208;donation and a distinctive 3&#8208;center&#8208;4&#8208;electron hyperbonding phenomenon in the P&#8323;Pd framework. These findings offer valuable insights into chemistry of cyclic polyphosphorus compounds and, in particular, the reactivity, structural flexibility, and the coordination properties of cationic triphosphorus species.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Vibration and Liquefaction of Flexible and Naturally Bent Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single crystals obtained by cocrystallization of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;azopyridine and long&#8208;chain fatty acids exhibit versatile stimuli&#8208;responsive properties: UV&#8208;induced rapid vibration, temporary photoliquefaction, and mechanical deformation. These remarkable photo&#8208;responsive properties arise from photoisomerization and photothermal effects, whereas flexible molecular packing enabled by long alkyl chains imparts deformability.








Abstract
Single crystals obtained by cocrystallization of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;azopyridine with long&#8208;chain fatty acids, viz. lauric acid, myristic acid, and palmitic acid, exhibit a variety of light&#8208;responsive properties. The molecular arrangement of the cocrystal components in the crystal structure, coupled with the flexibility of the long alkyl chains and the presence of the azo group, enables the elastic and plastically deformable crystals to demonstrate light responsiveness, which manifests as bending, vibration, and liquefaction. The photoresponses arise from two primary mechanisms: the photoisomerization of azopyridine groups within the crystal lattice and the photothermal effect that generates localized heat under UV light. Consequently, the single crystals display reversible bending and vibrational motion in response to on/off light cycles, as well as temporary liquefaction of the crystalline materials when exposed to higher&#8208;intensity UV light. The arrangement of the long alkyl chains and the presence of weak interactions within the crystal structure impart deformability to the single crystals while lowering melting points. This work illustrates how adaptive crystalline materials can be developed by modulating the crystal structure of light&#8208;sensitive molecular components through non&#8208;covalent synthesis.

         <title>Oxidative Dehydrogenation of N&#8208;Heteroaromatic Alkyl Alcohols and Amines Facilitated by Dearomative Tautomerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;heteroaromatic alkyl alcohols and amines are inherently unstable in acidic and/or basic solution due to an irreversible dehydrogenation that proceeds from a minority tautomer. In many cases, this reaction results in quantitative oxidation to the corresponding aldehyde, providing a simple, convenient, and green approach for preparing versatile synthetic building blocks.








Abstract
The oxidation of alcohols, amines, and halides is a fundamental transformation in organic chemistry with significant applications in the synthesis of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and natural products. Here we show that a broad variety of N&#8208;heteroarenes bearing hydroxymethyl, aminomethyl, or halomethyl groups are oxidatively dehydrogenated to their respective aldehydes by simply heating them in acidic or basic aqueous solution under ambient atmosphere. The quantitative oxidation of 9&#8208;acridinemethanol to 9&#8208;acridinecarboxaldehyde serves as an illustrative example, proceeding to completion within 3&#160;hours in refluxing 5% aqueous acetic acid or even household vinegar. Quinoline derivatives may be similarly oxidized but require higher temperatures and longer reaction times, while indole derivatives are oxidized under basic conditions. Based on comprehensive regioselectivity screens, internal kinetic isotope competition, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we propose a mechanism in which migration of a methylene hydrogen to the pyridinic nitrogen by acid&#8208;catalyzed dearomative tautomerization yields an unstable enol or enamine intermediate that then irreversibly loses two hydrogen atoms to atmospheric oxygen. In addition to the simplicity and environmentally benign nature of our method, we observe no indication of any over&#8208;oxidation to carboxylic acids. Finally, we demonstrate the synthetic utility of this reaction through two different one&#8208;pot formylations of acridine.

Here we show that a broad variety of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heteroarenes bearing hydroxymethyl, aminomethyl, or halomethyl groups are oxidatively dehydrogenated to their respective aldehydes by simply heating them in acidic or basic aqueous solution under ambient atmosphere. The quantitative oxidation of 9-acridinemethanol to 9-acridinecarboxaldehyde serves as an illustrative example, proceeding to completion within 3&#160;hours in refluxing 5% aqueous acetic acid or even household vinegar. Quinoline derivatives may be similarly oxidized but require higher temperatures and longer reaction times, while indole derivatives are oxidized under basic conditions. Based on comprehensive regioselectivity screens, internal kinetic isotope competition, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we propose a mechanism in which migration of a methylene hydrogen to the pyridinic nitrogen by acid-catalyzed dearomative tautomerization yields an unstable enol or enamine intermediate that then irreversibly loses two hydrogen atoms to atmospheric oxygen. In addition to the simplicity and environmentally benign nature of our method, we observe no indication of any over-oxidation to carboxylic acids. Finally, we demonstrate the synthetic utility of this reaction through two different one-pot formylations of acridine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Divergent Responses of Carbon Nitride Dot&#8208;Based Amorphous Species and Small Molecule Hybrids to Trace Level Analytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a bottom&#8208;up synthesis method using hydrothermal reaction of CA and U to produce CNDs with controllable properties. The approach yields two distinct fractions: polycrystalline small&#8208;molecule hybrids and amorphous CNDs. The research investigates how these different species affect explosive detection capabilities, providing insights for optimizing sensing applications through controlled synthesis conditions.








Abstract
Bottom&#8208;up synthesis of carbon nitride dots (CNDs) offers a versatile platform for the creation of diverse nanomaterials with tunable properties. Here, we report a facile hydrothermal approach using citric acid (CA) and urea (U) as precursors to synthesize CNDs with varying degrees of condensation and crystallinity. By carefully controlling reaction conditions and post&#8208;synthetic treatments, we obtained two distinct fractions: a polycrystalline fraction composed of small&#8208;molecule hybrids and an amorphous fraction containing CNDs. We then sought to understand how the dominant species in these fractions impact sensing abilities using trace&#8208;level explosive exemplars. The results have important implications for sensing and related applications where understanding the complex interplay between synthetic conditions and post&#8208;synthetic processing play vital roles in determining the final properties of CND materials.

         <title>Review of Metal Nitrides for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries: Design, Mechanisms, and Prospects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The article explores the performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries enhanced by metal nitrides, detailing the synthesis methods, morphological characteristics, and size&#8208;dependent effects. It also discusses underlying design principles for metal nitrides and outlines future directions for their application in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSB) emerge as the next generation battery technology owing to their high theoretical capacity and energy density. However, sluggish redox reactions coupled with severe volume alterations result in underachievement of the merits. Additionally, the atrocious shuttle effect prompts premature failure, thereby limiting life cycle count. Transition metal nitrides with excellent properties, including good electrical conductivity and catalytic effects, have been investigated as functional materials to address the challenges of LSB. Mainly, transition metal nitrides as well as their composites have been employed as hosts and interlayers to boost reaction kinetics and enhance the cycle life. This review focuses on the fundamental mechanisms of metal nitrides toward the capture and catalysis of polysulfides. The article highlights battery performance attained with key metal nitrides with the inclusion of the synthesis procedures, morphology, and size effects. Further, the possible principles for the design of metal nitrides, along with future directions, are discussed.

         <title>Cyanomethylation of Aldehydes on an Electrochemical Microflow System and Utility of Machine Learning&#8208;Assisted Examination of the Reaction Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical cyanomethylation reaction was developed. Using the electrochemical microflow reactor enables the reaction to yield almost exclusively products. To find the best reaction conditions, we used the Gaussian process regression (GPR), and the flow rates and the current values were explored. Our cyanomethylation was completed with a semi&#8208;catalytic electrical input, and the mechanism was discussed based on cyclic voltammetry (CV) and DFT calculations.








Abstract
Cyanomethylation of carbonyl compounds affords a &#946;&#8208;hydroxy nitrile, which is very useful in the field of synthetic organic chemistry. Although several electrochemical methods have also been reported to achieve cyanomethylation of carbonyl compounds, dehydration as a major side reaction is a significant issue that needs to be prevented. An electrochemical flow reactor, free from side reactions through rapid removal of the reaction solution from the electrode surface, enables the electrochemical cyanomethylation of aldehydes in acetonitrile without any dehydrated side products. To find the &#8220;best&#8221; reaction conditions for each starting material, we used machine learning (ML) models. In addition, comparing the ML models constructed using various molecular descriptors contributed to understanding the critical molecular properties to proceed the electrochemical cyanomethylation. Our cyanomethylation using a flow system went to completion with a semi&#8208;catalytic amount of electrical input, which is not consistent with the conventional basic mechanism, and DFT calculations suggest a radical mechanism.

         <dc:description>Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have shown significant promise in the realm of photocatalysis due to their distinctive optical and electrical properties. In this Perspective, we review the latest advancements in MHPs for photocatalysis, summarizing common modification methods aimed at enhancing photocatalytic efficiency and stability. We then highlight the changes in lattice and band structures exhibited by MHPs before and after photoexcitation, with a particular focus on the intricate and varied transformations observed in LFPMs. By emphasizing the importance of these lattice and band changes, we demonstrate how they can be leveraged to construct effective heterostructures and rationally design and synthesize novel perovskite materials with robust photocatalytic capabilities. We hope that this Perspective can offer researchers new insights into MHPs photocatalysis and advance the application of LFPMs in the field of photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of Chalcogen Interaction on the Structure of Methine&#8208;Bridged Trichalcogenophenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stereochemistry of methine&#8208;bridged trichalcogenophenes was elucidated through comprehensive structural analyses. Trithiophene showed a strong preference for the ZZ configuration, whereas its trifuran analog exhibited a near&#8208;statistical distribution of geometric isomers. X&#8208;ray crystallography and computational studies revealed that intramolecular S&#183;&#183;&#183;S chalcogen bonding stabilizes the ZZ configuration.








Abstract
Polythienylenemethylidenes (PTMs) are promising conjugated polymers for organic electronics owing to their narrow bandgaps and extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation. However, their stereochemistry remains unexplored. In this study, methine&#8208;bridged trithiophene and trifuran analogs were synthesized to investigate stereochemistry and chalcogen bonding effects. The compounds were obtained as mixtures of ZZ, EZ(= ZE), and EE geometric isomers, established through detailed NMR analyses. At thermal equilibrium, the ZZ isomer predominated in trithiophene (ZZ:(EZ&#160;+&#160;ZE):EE&#160;=&#160;58:35:6), whereas trifuran showed a near&#8208;statistical distribution.

     alt="Effect of Chalcogen Interaction on the Structure of Methine-Bridged Trichalcogenophenes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stereochemistry of methine-bridged trichalcogenophenes was elucidated through comprehensive structural analyses. Trithiophene showed a strong preference for the &lt;i&gt;ZZ&lt;/i&gt; configuration, whereas its trifuran analog exhibited a near-statistical distribution of geometric isomers. X-ray crystallography and computational studies revealed that intramolecular S&#183;&#183;&#183;S chalcogen bonding stabilizes the &lt;i&gt;ZZ&lt;/i&gt; configuration.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polythienylenemethylidenes (PTMs) are promising conjugated polymers for organic electronics owing to their narrow bandgaps and extended &#960;-conjugation. However, their stereochemistry remains unexplored. In this study, methine-bridged trithiophene and trifuran analogs were synthesized to investigate stereochemistry and chalcogen bonding effects. The compounds were obtained as mixtures of &lt;i&gt;ZZ&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;EZ&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;= ZE&lt;/i&gt;), and &lt;i&gt;EE&lt;/i&gt; geometric isomers, established through detailed NMR analyses. At thermal equilibrium, the &lt;i&gt;ZZ&lt;/i&gt; isomer predominated in trithiophene (&lt;i&gt;ZZ&lt;/i&gt;:(&lt;i&gt;EZ&#160;+&#160;ZE&lt;/i&gt;):&lt;i&gt;EE&#160;=&lt;/i&gt;&#160;58:35:6), whereas trifuran showed a near-statistical distribution. X-ray crystallography revealed intramolecular S&#183;&#183;&#183;S chalcogen bonding in trithiophene with S&#183;&#183;&#183;S distances (&#8776;3.04 &#197;) shorter than van der Waals radii and C&#8211;S&#183;&#183;&#183;S angles of 171&#176;. Comprehensive conformer searches and DFT calculations not only validated the higher stability of the &lt;i&gt;ZZ&lt;/i&gt; isomer in trithiophene but also provided calculated isomer distributions that closely matched the experimental values. Multi-faceted computational analysis (electron localization function (ELF), noncovalent interaction (NCI), quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM), and natural bond orbital (NBO))&#160;confirmed the presence of these chalcogen-centered interactions and quantified their strength through lone pair (LP)(S)&#8594;&#963;*(S&#8211;C) donor-acceptor orbital interactions.

         <dc:description>Photosynthetic water splitting catalyzed by the Mn4CaO5/6 cluster in the oxygen&#8208;evolving complex (OEC) of photosystem II (PSII) is crucial for sustaining the supply of oxygen on Earth. A recent serial femtosecond X&#8208;ray crystallography (XFEL) study has provided unprecedented insights into the structural dynamics of the OEC during the S&#8323; &#8594; [S&#8324;] &#8594; S&#8320; transition, revealing that this process involves a peroxide intermediate formed via oxo&#8208;oxyl radical coupling between O5 and Ox. However, computational models based on the high oxidation state (HOS) paradigm have failed to explain key XFEL observations, including the apparent loss of Ox upon peroxide formation and the largely unchanged Mn4&#8211;O5 distance from S&#8324; to the peroxide intermediate. Here, we apply density functional theory to remodel the S4 &#8594; S0 transition within the low oxidation state (LOS) paradigm and show that this model yields results more consistent with the XFEL observations. Notably, this study demonstrates that the LOS paradigm can support the formation of an oxyl species essential for O&#8208;O coupling and subsequent O2 generation, a capability previously thought to be exclusive to the HOS model. &#160;Our findings offer an alternative explanation that complements existing models and broadens our understanding of the OEC mechanism</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
A radical cyclization reaction of 1,6&#8208;enynes using Cu(I) as the catalyst and 4&#8208;methylbenzoic acid as the cocatalyst has been used to access 1&#8208;Indanone derivatives. There are some advantages to the reaction such as available materials, simple operation, and compatibility with a wide range of substituents. Notably, in the absence of 4&#8208;methylbenzoic acid, the reaction undergoes a dramatic shift in product selectivity, yielding 1H&#8209;cyclopropa[b] naphthalene&#8208;2,7&#8208;diones exclusively under the same conditions, with Cu(I) acting as the sole catalyst.








Abstract
1&#8208;Indanone derivatives are efficiently synthesized via a radical cyclization reaction of 1,6&#8208;enynes, using TBHP as both oxidant and reactant, in the presence of Cu(I) as the catalyst and 4&#8208;methyl benzoic acid as the cocatalyst. Notably, in the absence of 4&#8208;methyl benzoic acid, the reaction undergoes a dramatic shift in product selectivity, yielding 1H&#8209;cyclopropa[b]naphthalene&#8208;2,7&#8208;diones exclusively under the same conditions, with Cu(I) acting as the sole catalyst. This transformation offers key advantages, including operational simplicity, cost&#8208;effective and readily available materials, scalability to gram quantities, and compatibility with a wide range of functional groups. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations confirmed that the reaction proceeds through a radical pathway, highlighting the pivotal role of 4&#8208;methylbenzoic acid as the cocatalyst in altering product selectivity.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Grafting a linear disulfide&#8208;bridged polymer to a supporting polymer backbone achieved heterogeneous thiyl radical photocatalysis. The polyvinyl backbone ensures recyclability while enabling thiyl radical generation for organic transformations. Achieving &#8764;99% conversion for diarylalkyne photooxidation, the design strategy combines robustness, solubility, and reusability, advancing thiyl radical catalysis for sustainable applications.








Abstract
Dynamic disulfide bonds offer a promising avenue for developing robust and reversible photocatalysts. This study introduces a novel polymer, Poly&#8208;SS, designed for heterogeneous thiyl radical photocatalysis, leveraging the dynamic nature of disulfide linkages. Poly&#8208;SS features linear disulfide&#8208;containing polymers grafted onto a polyvinyl backbone, combining the photoactivity of disulfide with the structural integrity of polyvinyl. This design facilitates efficient thiyl radical generation upon photoirradiation, enabling challenging organic transformations. Poly&#8208;SS demonstrates exceptional photocatalytic efficiency for the aerobic oxidation of diarylalkynes to 1,2&#8208;diketones, achieving&#160;&gt;99% conversion. The polyvinyl backbone plays a crucial role in maintaining polymer recyclability by promoting thiyl radical recombination and preserving disulfide linkages, addressing the inherent lability of molecular thiyl radicals. Furthermore, copolymerization with soluble monomer enhances the solubility of Poly&#8208;SS, enabling facile thin&#8208;film fabrication for diverse photoreactor designs. This work highlights a significant advancement in heterogeneous thiyl radical photocatalysis, showcasing the potential of carefully designed disulfide&#8208;linked polymers to overcome limitations associated with traditional molecular catalysts by integrating dynamic covalent chemistry with a robust polymer architecture.

         <dc:description>
2D inorganic nanomaterials, including transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), MXenes, black phosphorus (BP) and hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN), have transformed biosensing. Their superior conductivity, extensive surface area and biocompatibility facilitates disease detection and diagnosis. This review underscores recent advancements, focusing on their physicochemical characteristics and biosensing potential in healthcare.








Abstract
With the growing need for rapid, sensitive and accurate point&#8208;of&#8208;care biosensors, 2D nanomaterials have gained significant attention, establishing them as versatile candidates for advanced biomedical applications. Biosensors utilizing 2D nanomaterials enable real&#8208;time disease monitoring, allowing for prompt intervention and therapy, tracking of physiological activities and enhancing the understanding of the human biosystem. Since they are cost&#8208;effective and user&#8208;friendly, 2D nanomaterials have been utilized in commercial biosensors. Over the past decade, graphene and its derivatives have been the most studied 2D nanomaterials, due to their large surface area and tuneable electronic and optical properties, which significantly enhance their sensitivity and specificity. Nevertheless, recently discovered 2D nanomaterials, including MXenes, black phosphorus and hexagonal boron nitride, remain largely unexplored. Despite their numerous applications, the broader potential of these materials in biosensing remains insufficiently explored in current literature. This review offers a comprehensive perspective by specifically focusing on inorganic 2D nanomaterials, an area that remains underrepresented in the literature. It provides an in&#8208;depth overview of their unique physicochemical properties and how these features contribute toward enhancing the performance of biosensors, thereby offering new and valuable insights into their emerging role in advanced biomedical diagnostics.

         <title>Dinuclear Copper Complex with a Pyridazine&#8208;Bridged Octadentate Ligand: Monooxygenase Activity and Characterization of Copper&#8208;Oxygen Intermediates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Access to various copper&#8208;oxygen intermediates: Depending on the reaction conditions, different copper&#8208;oxygen intermediates can be obtained with our new dinuclear complex. Whereas low&#8208;temperature oxygenation leads to a &#956;&#8208;1,1 hydroperoxo complex, oxygenation at room temperature generates a &#8220;green species&#8221; that looks like a mono &#956;&#8208;oxo complex but rather corresponds to a dihydroxo complex. The reactivities of all of these intermediates as well as the &#956;&#8208;hydroxo complex toward hydrocarbons are investigated.








Abstract
Copper&#8208;containing enzymes catalyze the mono&#8208;oxygenation of aromatic and aliphatic substrates in nature. Herein, we report on the synthesis of a new dinuclear copper complex supported by an octadentate ligand with a pyridazine backbone. Low&#8208;temperature oxygenation leads to a &#956;&#8208;1,1&#8208;hydroperoxo dicopper(II) (Cu2OOH) complex, which in turn stoichiometrically converts anthrone (AT) to anthraquinone (AQ). Oxygenation at room temperature, by contrast, leads to a new species that mediates the conversion of AT to AQ in a catalytic fashion, but neither corresponds to a &#956;&#8208;peroxo nor a mono &#956;&#8208;oxo dicopper complex. For further analysis, a &#956;&#8208;hydroxo dicopper(II) (Cu2OH) complex is synthesized by oxidation of the copper(I) complex with AgOTf. The electronic and geometric structures of the Cu2OOH and Cu2OH intermediates, as well as the structure of the room&#8208;temperature oxygenation product are elucidated by UV/Vis, Raman, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and mass spectrometry, coupled to DFT.

         <title>Ligand Mediated Metal&#8208;Metal and Metal&#8208;Ligand Cooperativity in Cesium Coordination Polymers and its Beneficial Role in the ROP of Cyclic Esters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique cesium coordination polymeric networks, a 2D sheet, an infinite ladder chain, and a well&#8208;connected 3D cage were developed by tuning the substituent on iminopyrrolyl architecture. The 2D sheet of cesium polymer was efficiently fragmented into a monomeric complex by employing 18&#8208;Crown&#8208;6. Subsequently, cesium complexes were found to be competent catalysts in the ROP of rac&#8208;lactide and &#949;&#8208;caprolactone.








Abstract
Designing a multimetallic catalyst based on the principle of metalloenzymes has emerged as a promising route to enhance catalytic performance owing to the combined action of different metal centers in a cooperative fashion. The cooperativity of metal centers with the surrounding ligand environment in metalloenzymes plays a crucial role in driving efficient catalysis. However, the replication of such cooperativity in a synthetic system is very challenging. In this work, we report the synthesis and characterization of diverse cesium coordination polymeric networks, a 2D sheet, [Cs{&#954;2&#8208;C4H3N&#8208;2(CH&#160;=&#160;N(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3))}]&#8734; (1), an infinite ladder chain, [Cs{&#954;3&#8208;C4H3N&#8208;2(CH&#160;=&#160;N(CHPh2))}]&#8734; (2), and a 3D cage [Cs2{&#954;3&#8208;(C4H3N&#8208;2(CH&#160;=&#160;NCH2CH2N(CH2CH2)2O))}]&#8734; (3). This was accomplished by a variation of the substituent on the iminopyrrolyl ligand. Moreover, we studied a breakdown of the 2D sheet coordination polymer (1) into contact pair monomeric cesium complex [(18&#8208;Cr&#8208;6)Cs(&#954;2&#8208;C4H3N&#8208;2(CH&#160;=&#160;N(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3)))] (4). In the coordination polymers, multiple Cs centers are held together within a proximal distance (3.5&#8211;6&#160;&#197;) via an iminopyrrolyl ligand. The Cs coordination polymer 2 displays the highest catalytic efficiency in ring opening polymerization of rac&#8208;lactide (ROP), giving a turnover frequency (TOF) value of 49.5 h&#8722;1 compared to 15.7 h&#8722;1 and 24.0 h&#8722;1 for 1 and 3. The higher reactivity of 2 in comparison to 1 and 3 is due to the metal&#8208;metal cooperativity in cesium coordination polymeric networks.

         <title>A Very Readily Prepared Ligand for Rhodium Catalyzed Propene Hydroformylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent developments aimed at switching the selectivity of rhodium catalyzed hydroformylation from a linear&#8208;selective to a branched selective reaction feature ligands that are relatively complicated to prepare. A new ligand, EasyDiPhos, can be made in just one synthetic step and gives unusually low n:iso ratios, i.e., favoring the branched aldehyde, iso&#8208;butanal, in propene hydroformylation.








Abstract
In the search for an easy&#8208;to&#8208;make ligand that would enable Rh catalyzed hydroformylation of propene to favor the branched aldehydes, iso&#8208;butanal, bis&#8208;phosphonites and bis&#8208;phosphoramidites were designed. Catalysts derived from bis&#8208;phosphonites gave the desired low n:iso ratios, but were unstable to hydrolysis. A bis&#8208;phosphoramidite ligand (EasyDiPhos) that can be made in just one synthetic step has been discovered that enables Rh&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylations to proceed with unusually low n:iso ratios. They were also found to have significant stability to moisture, air, and to relatively high temperatures during hydroformylation conditions. The latter was studied using a combination of high pressure infra&#8208;red (HPIR) spectroscopy and NMR analysis of the catalyst resting state after 1 week under relevant conditions. Propene hydroformylation with n:iso ratios well below 1 was carried out and with turnover numbers around 1000&#160;mol/mol in 1 hour reaction time. One of the ligands, whilst not being the most iso&#8208;selective example, had a partially flexible n:iso ratio depending on temperature and pressure. Two Pt(II) complexes were prepared and their X&#8208;ray crystal structures determined. The most&#160;iso&#8208;selective catalyst was examined at low temperature (prioritizing iso&#8208;selectivity over rates) in hydroformylation of some other terminal alkenes with significant branched selectivity.

         <title>Carboxyltin&#8208;Functionalized Tungstobismuthate/TiO2 Photoanodes for Enhanced Energy Storage Effect in Metal Photoelectrochemical Cathodic Protection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, POMs are introduced into the PECCP system. The carboxyltin functionalized Bi&#8208;POMs can tightly composite with TiO2, and the Bi&#8208;POM/TiO2 photoanodes can provide PECCP for 304 stainless steel in seawater, which is expected to be a promising photoanode for in real seawater.








Abstract
Photoelectrochemical cathodic protection (PECCP) is a novel and environment&#8208;friendly metal anti&#8208;corrosion technology, and constructing photoelectronic materials that can provide sustained protection under both illumination and dark is a key challenge. Herein, four cases of transition metal (TM) and carboxyltin&#8208;modified polyoxometalates (POMs) based on trivacant Keggin&#8208;type tungstobismuthate subunits, denoted as Bi&#8208;POMs, were designed and synthesized in aqueous solutions. The introduced carboxyl groups can anchor TiO2, and the export of electrons from POM clusters occurred, making these POM&#8208;based materials useable in the PECCP field for the first time. Under illumination, the Bi&#8208;POM/TiO2 photoanodes were capable of cathodically polarizing 304 stainless steel (304SS) by 440&#8211;465&#160;mV. In darkness, their coupled potentials of &#8722;197 to &#8722;175&#160;mV were significantly lower than that of TiO2 (&#8722;97&#160;mV), indicating the obviously enhanced dark cathodic protection effect. Precisely, the interdependence between Bi, POM, and TiO2 ensures Bi&#8208;POMs to protect 304SS in seawater and provide stable and sustainable cathodic protection under intermittent light. The underlying mechanisms of PECCP were explored by a variety of experimental techniques including the femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The integration of POMs into the PECCP system represents a new insight in the development of green metal protection technologies.

Herein, four cases of transition metal (TM) and carboxyltin-modified polyoxometalates (POMs) based on trivacant Keggin-type tungstobismuthate subunits, denoted as Bi-POMs, were designed and synthesized in aqueous solutions. The introduced carboxyl groups can anchor TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and the export of electrons from POM clusters occurred, making these POM-based materials useable in the PECCP field for the first time. Under illumination, the Bi-POM/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoanodes were capable of cathodically polarizing 304 stainless steel (304SS) by 440&#8211;465&#160;mV. In darkness, their coupled potentials of &#8722;197 to &#8722;175&#160;mV were significantly lower than that of TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&#8722;97&#160;mV), indicating the obviously enhanced dark cathodic protection effect. Precisely, the interdependence between Bi, POM, and TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ensures Bi-POMs to protect 304SS in seawater and provide stable and sustainable cathodic protection under intermittent light. The underlying mechanisms of PECCP were explored by a variety of experimental techniques including the femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The integration of POMs into the PECCP system represents a new insight in the development of green metal protection technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bottom&#8208;up construction of leaf&#8208;like materials capable of using visible light and water to produce oxygen and chemical energy&#160;is a major goal of artificial photosynthesis. In this work, we show that robust artificial cells (protocells) prepared by&#160;the membranization of polymer/nucleotide coacervate droplets with a&#160;bio&#8208;inspired Ru&#8208;based polyoxometalate catalytic oxygen evolving center&#160;are capable of continuous&#160;light&#8208;assisted water&#160;oxidation at room temperature. We then&#160;present&#160;a method to electrostatically assemble millions of the&#160;photocatalytic protocells into tissue&#8208;like protocellular sheets and spheroids, and demonstrate that the protocellular assemblies exhibit enhanced rates of photocatalytic water oxidation compared with individual protocells. Our results highlight opportunities for synergistically integrating key aspects of photocatalysis, cytomimetics and bottom&#8208;up engineering towards the development of modular photosynthetic active matter and applications in artificial photosynthesis and energy capture.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantum Chemistry based Simulation of Enantioseparation on Cyclodextrin&#8208; and Polysaccharide&#8208;based Chiral Stationary Phases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We assess the capability of modern quantum chemical methods to simulate enantioseparation on chiral stationary phases (CSPs) in high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) by comparing calculated and experimental elution orders (EEOs). Compared to previous studies, this work utilizes more accurate state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art density functional theory (DFT) methods combined with automated computational workflows. The proposed approach employs molecular docking, conformer sampling, and DFT refinement for final ensemble&#8208;based association free energy calculations of two diastereomeric complexes. Ten drug&#8208;type molecules were considered on two common CSPs for which various molecular models were investigated. While the association free energies of the strongest binding motifs were rather system&#8208;depended ranging from about &#8722;9 kcal/mol to 29 kcal/mol, the differences between the two enantiomers were always only a few kcal/mol, sometimes even below 1 kcal/mol. Despite these small differences, correct determination of EEOs for all tested cyclodextrin&#8208;based CSP systems was achieved. Even for more flexible polysaccharide&#8208;based CSPs, the workflow yielded correct EEO results in 90% of the tested cases provided that a sufficiently large cut&#8208;out of the CSP material consisting of about 150 atoms was considered as model. Due to the latter constraint, the method remains computationally expensive, requiring further research for improving practical application in, e.g., screening studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Photoredox/Palladium Catalysis Enabled Enantioselective Heck/Reductive Allylic Homocoupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochemical palladium&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective reductive coupling reaction of conjugated dienes was developed. This transformation provides a platform for synthesizing optically pure chiral 1,5&#8208;dienes bearing 1,8&#8208;stereocenters.








Abstract
The merger of palladium&#8208;catalyzed Tsuji&#8211;Trost reactions with photochemical radical chemistry represents a cutting&#8208;edge field in transition metal catalysis. We report a photochemical palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Heck/reductive allylic homocoupling reaction of 1,3&#8208;dienes. The transformation has a wide substrate scope and good functional group tolerance, providing a platform to synthesize optically pure chiral 1,5&#8208;dienes bearing 1,8&#8208;stereocenters. The reaction initiates with a Heck&#8208;type addition to generate a &#960;&#8208;allyl&#8208;PdII species, followed by a photoredox process or ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) to generate an allylic radical, which undergoes homocoupling to give the final product.

         <title>Photocatalytic Oxidation of Alcohols with Organic Dyes: From Homogeneous Systems to Sensitized Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We discuss the developments in the light&#8208;driven oxidation of alcohols with PC. We report cases where the homogeneous systems can be interfaced with electrochemical tools or adapted in flow and where the PC are integrated in sensitized materials.








Abstract
The oxidation of alcohols retains an enormous importance in industry and in synthetic organic chemistry. The renaissance in photocatalysis is offering new routes to conduct this class of transformations under benign and sustainable conditions. In this concept article, we highlight the efforts that have been conducted in light&#8208;driven oxidation of alcohols using organic photocatalysts (PC). After an overview of relevant industrial processes, we will discuss relevant examples of PC employed in solution or when integrated in photosynthetic schemes within semiconductor slides or nanoparticles. The combination of the photochemical systems with electrochemical routes or their engineering in flow will be considered. Where possible, we highlight also mechanistic aspects that reveal the key steps involved and contribute to improve the performance of the process. We finally present an outlook on the future perspectives and developments in the field.

         <title>DNA Tetrahedron&#8208;Enhanced Catalytic Hairpin Assembly for in Situ Monitoring of Viral RNA in Host Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional system based on tetrahedral DNA nanostructures (TDN) for detecting and monitoring the release and replication of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) genomic RNA in host cells. The system responds to the presence of viral RNA, utilizing a highly efficient TDN&#8208;based hyperbranched catalytic hairpin assembly to produce specific fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) signals corresponding to the level of the target viral RNA.








Abstract
Viruses pose significant threats to global public health and have substantial socio&#8208;economic impacts. Developing rapid, sensitive, and specific in situ virus&#8208;detection technologies is crucial for tracking viral genome release, replication in host cells, and intercellular transmission, thus holding great promise in understanding viral infection mechanisms, enabling early diagnosis, screening antiviral drugs, and formulating prevention and treatment strategies. In this study, we present a multifunctional tetrahedral DNA nanostructure (TDN)&#8208;based system designed to monitor viral RNA levels in host cells in situ. The system employs a TDN&#8208;based hyperbranched catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) reaction to achieve rapid and powerful signal amplification, generating specific fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) signals in response to target viral RNA. Using Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) as a model, we developed the THA@JEV system responding to JEV&#8208;RNA. This system demonstrated rapid and sensitive detection of JEV&#8208;RNA within 12 minutes in a cell&#8208;free environment, enabling real&#8208;time imaging of JEV&#8208;RNA in situ within host cells. The integrated TDN structure enhanced the biological stability of the probes and ensured their reliability under various stress conditions and microenvironments. This TDN&#8208;based sensor system shows significant potential for elucidating viral infection pathways and advancing related virology research, as well as for screening antiviral drugs.

The system employs a TDN-based hyperbranched catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) reaction to achieve rapid and powerful signal amplification, generating specific fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) signals in response to target viral RNA. Using Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) as a model, we developed the &lt;b&gt;THA@JEV&lt;/b&gt; system responding to JEV-RNA. This system demonstrated rapid and sensitive detection of JEV-RNA within 12 minutes in a cell-free environment, enabling real-time imaging of JEV-RNA in situ within host cells. The integrated TDN structure enhanced the biological stability of the probes and ensured their reliability under various stress conditions and microenvironments. This TDN-based sensor system shows significant potential for elucidating viral infection pathways and advancing related virology research, as well as for screening antiviral drugs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>N,N&#8208;Bis(trifluoromethyl)aminoacetonitrile&#160;(CF3)2NCH2CN (1) that is accessible via a simple single&#8208;step protocol is establish&#173;ed as building block for the introduction of the (CF3)2N group. The two reaction sites of&#160;1, the methylene unit and the nitrile (cyano) group, provide access to different organic substance classes. This in&#173;cludes alkenes via Knoevenagel conden&#173;sations, and&#160;N&#8208;hetero&#173;cycles and acid derivatives obtained by addition reactions to the nitrile unit. These new (CF3)2N derivatives are potential buil&#173;ding blocks containing the bis(trifluoromethyl)amino group. Deprotonation of&#160;1&#160;at the methyl&#173;ene group highlights the electron&#8208;with&#173;drawing nature of the (CF3)2N group. The {(CF3)2NCHCN}&#8211;&#160;anion (1&#8211;) is characterized by NMR spec&#173;tros&#173;copy and its reaction with [Ph3PAuCl] results in [Ph3PAuCH{N(CF3)2}&#173;(CN)] (Au1) and [(Ph3PAu)2C{N(CF3)2}(CN)] (Au21). Crystal structure analysis of (CF3)2NCH2CN (1),&#160;Au21, and almost all alkenes,&#160;N&#8208;hetero&#173;&#173;cycles, and acid derivatives with a (CF3)2N group combined with spectroscopic data and results from DFT calculations provide insight into properties of the highly fluorinated (CF3)2N substituent. Especially the ability of the amino nitrogen atom to participate in weak hydrogen bonding, albeit its low basicity, is of relevance.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd[B(S2O7)2]2 and Pd[B(SO4)(S2O7)]2: Two Borosulfates with Pd2+ in Cctahedral and one with Pd2+ in Square Planar Oxygen Coordination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of elemental palladium with B2O3 and SO3 at elevated temperature results in the formation of blue crystals of Pd[B(S2O7)2]2. Dependent on the reaction conditions, the compound crystallizes in two different polymorphs obtained as bulk samples. In both structures the Pd2+ cations are coordinated by six oxygen atoms in form of an almost perfect octahedron. All oxygen atoms belong to the borosulfate anions [B(S2O7)2]&#8211; and link via Pd2+ cations to an extended network structure. Within the uncommon octahedral oxygen coordination, the Pd2+ cations reveal a d8 high&#8208;spin configuration, which leads to paramagnetism. Occasionally, red crystals are formed during the reaction next to the major fraction of blue crystals of Pd[B(S2O7)2]2. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis on the red crystals reveals the sum formula Pd[B(SO4)(S2O7)]2 with Pd2+ in square&#8208;planar coordination.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Properties of an Aryloxenium Cation with a Triplet Electronic Ground State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryloxenium cations contain a formally positively&#8208;charged, monovalent oxygen atom with an incomplete electron shell. In spite of this unusual structural element, they are key intermediates in many important processes, such as biological oxidation reactions and the industrial generation of thermoplastics. However, the development of new applications is hindered by the lack of knowledge on their fundamental chemical properties. While most past studies have focused on aryloxenium cations with singlet electronic ground states, minor structural modifications can produce aryloxenium cations that have a triplet ground state. Unfortunately, examination of the reactivity of triplet aryloxenium cations is limited to just two studies that reported the detection of H atom abstraction from solvents. A detailed kinetic reactivity study involving cyclohexane, allyl iodide and dimethyl disulfide reagents is reported here for an aryloxenium cation with a triplet electronic ground state, the 2&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;pyridyloxenium cation.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitroreductase&#8208;Responsive Bioorthogonal Tetrazine Conjugations in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prodrugs in response to tumor overexpressed enzymes offer a targeted approach for cancer therapy. However, this strategy faces several challenges, including poor water solubility, off&#8208;target effects, and tumor heterogeneity. To address these limitations, this study developed a novel class of nitroreductase&#8208;responsive tetrazine precursors by employing nitrobenzyl as a masking group for dihydrotetrazines (NBdTz), which can be further functionalized with targeting peptides. Furthermore, we have demonstrated a dual tumor&#8208;selective on demand bioorthogonal prodrug activation enabled by RGD&#8208;NBdTz. RGD promotes tumor cellular uptake by interacting with tumor&#8208;associated integrin &#945;v&#946;3, and subsequent enzymatic reduction of aromatic nitro group of NBdTz by overexpressed NTR among hypoxic tumor microenvironment leads to the liberation of the bioorthogonal handle tetrazine, resulting in the anticipated bioorthogonal activation of trans&#8208;cyclooctene caged payloads through "click&#8208;to&#8208;release" reactions. We envision the presented NBdTz enabled tumor&#8208;selective on demand tetrazine ligation offers new opportunities for cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic and Magnetic Properties of Ferrous Iron in a True Square&#8208;Planar Molecular Environment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electronic and magnetic properties of ferrous iron in the substituted iron phthalocyanine, FePcOAr, exhibiting a true square&#8208;planar molecular environment, are investigated. Inhibition of intermolecular interactions by steric substituents, allows detailed investigation of the electronic structure arising from the planar geometry of the d6 electron configuration. Complementary magnetometry, M&#246;ssbauer, FD&#8208;FT THz&#8208;EPR and paramagnetic NMR spectroscopies show that FePcOAr has an S = 1 ground state with large positive, axial zero&#8208;field splitting and a strongly anisotropic g&#8208;tensor, with two g&#8208;values much larger than the free electron g&#8208;value and one smaller. Correlation between the magnetic properties and the electronic structure is provided by high&#8208;level quantum chemical calculations. The calculations indicate a nearly triply degenerate ground level, in which spin&#8208;orbit coupling mixes the isolated 3A2g ground state with two excited 3Eg states, whose energy gaps to the ground state are almost identical. These findings provide valuable insights in the electronic structure of phthalocyanines and the long standing discussion on their true electronic ground level, which has important implications for the application of this important class of complexes in catalysis and magnetic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Thermo&#8208;Mechanochemical Syntheses of Metal Phthalocyanines and Polyphthalocyanines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a thermo&#8208;mechanochemical synthesis of metal phthalocyanines with varying metal centers and building blocks. The reactions were performed using a Retsch Mixer Mill 400 equipped with heating jackets, achieving quantitative yields at 120 &#176;C within 2 hours. A systematic screening of reaction parameters, including temperature, reaction time, frequency, and liquid&#8208;assisted grinding (LAG), revealed that temperature and time significantly influence the reaction outcome, as well as the use of LAG compared to neat grinding, which further enhances the yield. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of the obtained metal phthalocyanines confirmed the presence of different polymorphs, suggesting a correlation between reaction conditions and crystallinity. Furthermore, the crystalline cobalt polyphthalocyanine (CoPPc) was successfully synthesized with a yield of &gt;99%.</dc:description>

Furthermore, the crystalline cobalt polyphthalocyanine (CoPPc) was successfully synthesized with a yield of &amp;gt;99%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Bistricyclic Aromatic Enes Containing Bifluorenylidene Units via Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Tandem Suzuki Coupling/Heck Cyclization Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A variety of bifluorenylidene&#8208;based bistricyclic aromatic enes (BAEs) and their derivatives have been prepared via the palladium&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki coupling/Heck cyclization tandem reaction in one pot. In the new scheme 2&#8208;bromophenyl trifluoromethanesulfonate and similar derivatives were chosen as one of reaction substrates, which could undergo tandem Suzuki coupling/Heck cyclization reaction with suitable arylboronic acid ester substrates to afford the expected BAEs and their derivatives. In the newly designed scheme, the raw materials are easier to obtain and can be applied to the synthesis of more BAEs and their derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Ligand Cooperativity via &#928;&#8208;&#928; Interactions Supporting Outer&#8208;Sphere Hydride Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A set of phosphine&#8208;free Ru(II)&#8208;CNC pincer complexes with benzimidazolylidene&#8208;based CNC&#8208;ligands have been synthesized and characterized which show excellent catalytic activity towards &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones using primary alcohols. DFT investigations revealed that these seemingly non&#8208;bifunctional complexes can operate via inner&#8208;sphere and outer&#8208;sphere mechanisms for the alcohol dehydrogenation step; however, the outer&#8208;sphere path is favored for the subsequent steps. The outer&#8208;sphere path is found to be supported by &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction between the extended aromatic ring system of the benzimidazolylidene&#8208;based CNC&#8208;ligand and aromatic rings of the substrates in a new, unprecedented case of metal&#8208;ligand cooperativity.</dc:description>

         <title>Titanium cis&#8208;DACH Salan Catalyst for the Efficient Epoxidation of Non&#8208;Activated Olefins with Hydrogen Peroxide &#8208; Terminal&#8208;Selective Epoxidation of Multiply &#160;Unsaturated Terpenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a new generation of highly active and readily available homogeneous titanium catalysts for the epoxidation of non&#8208;activated olefins with aqueous hydrogen peroxide. Key feature is the introduction of pentafluorophenyl substituents into a salan ligand derived from cis&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane (cis&#8208;DACH). Our novel salan ligand is accessible in one single step by reductive alkylation of cis&#8208;DACH with 3&#8208;(pentafluorophenyl)salicylic aldehyde. In situ com&#173;plexation with Ti(OiPr)4 of the cis&#8208;DACH salan provides the titanium catalyst which, in the presence of aqueous hydrogen peroxide, smoothly epoxidizes a broad spectrum of olefins with up to 95% yield, at a catalyst loading of 0.5 mol&#8208;% only. The achiral cis&#8208;DACH salan catalyst showed syn&#8208;selectivity (4.7:1) in the epoxidation of a chiral, racemic terminal allylic alcohol. This catalyst furthermore allows the regioselective (up to 49:1) epoxidation of the terminal double bond in multiply unsaturated terpenes such as myrcene, (S)&#8208;citronellene, and (R)&#8208;linalool. For the latter two substrates, syn/anti&#8208;selectivity of up to 9:1 was observed. Augmented syn/anti&#8208;selectivity (up to 50:1 syn, or 25:1 anti) can be induced in the epoxidation of the chiral substrates (S)&#8208;citronellene and (R)&#8208;linalool when the "matched" enantiomer of the chiral "Berkessel salalen ligand" is employed.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvatochromism and Redox Multi&#8208;Switch in a Trinuclear Cobalt(II) Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A trinuclear cobalt(II) complex incorporating the redox&#8208;active hexahydroxytriphenylene (H6HHTP) ligand was prepared and isolated in two different redox states: [CoII3(sq&#8208;sq&#8208;sq)]3+ (1) and [CoII3(cat&#8208;sq&#8208;sq)]2+ (2) (sq = semiquinone; cat = catecholate), enabled by its remarkable solvatochromic behavior. The ligand field tuning of the Co(II) centers through the ancillary ligand Me3TPA (tris(6&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine) allowed accessing six reversible one&#8208;electron processes instead of only three with the parent TPA ligand, therefore increasing the range of redox&#8208;coupled magnetic and optical switching in this system. Upon reduction, the three redox processes are ligand&#8208;centered and involve the three sq&#8226;&#8208;/cat2&#8208; couples of HHTP, while we hypothesize that some of the oxidation processes may involve the Co(II) metallic species.</dc:description>

         <title>1,3&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;Zwitterionic Complexes of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes in Reactions with Arylallenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of 2&#8208;arylcyclopropane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylates (ACDC) with GaCl3 and other Lewis acids in the presence of 3&#8208;arylbuta&#8208;1,2&#8208;dienes, which acts as a trapping agent for the 1,2&#8208; or 1,3&#8208;zwitterionic intermediates being generated, has been studied. The reaction of 1,2&#8208;zwitterionic gallium complexes at low temperature has been found to give products of annulation at the phenyl substituent in the allene, 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;(inden&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethylmalonates, as the main products. Only in the case of naphthylcyclopropanedicarboxylate, the formation of a polycyclic frame by annulation at both aromatic moieties occurred upon an increase in temperature to 0&#176;C. Trapping of 1,3&#8208;zwitterions, the primary intermediates of cyclopropane ring opening, by the indicated allene was most successful if catalytic amounts of GaCl3 were added directly to the reaction mixture. In this case, the reaction followed the pathway of the usual formal (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition of 1,3&#8208;zwitterions at each of the double bonds of the allene to give the corresponding exo&#8208;methylenecyclopentane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylates in up to 93% yields. This process occurred with the highest efficiency at the unsubstituted double bond of 3&#8208;arylbuta&#8208;1,2&#8208;diene.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetically arrested SERS&#8208;Active aggregates for biosensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is a demand for biosensors capable of long&#8208;term, non&#8208;invasive monitoring of low analyte concentrations in various biofluids for diagnostics, personalized healthcare, and disease monitoring. Biofluids present challenges to biosensor sensing and stability on account of their complex composition and dynamic nature. Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) offers ultra&#8208;high sensitivity, non&#8208;destructive, real&#8208;time monitoring and non&#8208;invasive detection, ideal for sensing in complex media. Plasmonic gold nanoparticle (AuNP) SERS&#8208;active assemblies have been widely explored owning to their biocompatibility and tuneable sensitivity based on AuNP morphology. Controlled aggregation of AuNPs has been achieved by incorporating a &#8216;molecular&#8208;glue&#8217;, cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]), to produce AuNP:CB[7] aggregates containing robust nanogaps (ca. 1 nm) and displaying strong, reproducible SERS signals at low concentrations, but eventually leads to irreversible precipitation. Here we employ thiolated poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG&#8208;SH) to produce kinetically trapped metastable AuNP:CB[7]:PEG aggregates. The aggregates maintain SERS&#8208;activity, are highly tuneable through facile modification of the PEG chain length and grafting density, and possess improved stability. Moreover, the AuNP:CB[7]:PEG aggregates demonstrate low concentration detection of a common Raman reporter alongside a bioanalyte in a range of biofluids highlighting the potential application of these aggregates for non&#8208;invasive in vivo long&#8208;term monitoring alongside future customized SERS biosensing applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Practical Electrochemical Hydroxynitration and Chloronitration Bifunctionalization of Alkenes with NaNO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein developed a novel method for generating nitro radicals using sodium nitrite under electrocatalytic conditions for the first time. A series of vicinal hydroxynitro or chloronitro compounds was generated in good yields. This methodology features simple reaction setup, mild reaction conditions, and cheap electrodes, and simultaneously shows excellent functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope, enabling efficient gram&#8208;scale reactions with good to excellent yields. Besides, the EIS and CV results provided deeper insights into the reaction mechanism. Further extensions of the method have also confirmed the practicality of the strategy developed.</dc:description>

         <title>3,4,5&#8208;Trifluorophenyldiazonium &#8211; a unique radical source for the visible light induced, catalyst&#8208;free arylation of tyrosine residues in peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct radical arylation of tyrosine residues in peptides has been achieved under highly attractive conditions, requiring only the peptide substrate, a 3,4,5&#8208;trifluorophenyldiazonium salt and irradiation with visible light. Being well&#8208;balanced in its reactivity to form strong charge transfer complexes with the phenolic side chain, which are required for initiation and aryl radical formation, the trifluoro substitution still shows sufficient stability towards nucleophilic aromatic substitution in aqueous solution. Besides allowing selective arylation, the introduction of the 3,4,5&#8208;trifluorophenyl unit enables further functionalization as well as potential applications in NMR and MRT studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Seawater Oxygen Evolution with Improved Electronic Environment of NiCoPS through Fluorine Doping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing economical and robust electrocatalysts to prevent chlorine ions corrosion and improve seawater splitting efficiency is essential for seawater electrolysis. Herein, fluorine&#8208;doped nickel cobalt phospho&#8208;sulfide nanowires (F&#8208;NiCoPS NWs) were synthesized as high&#8208;performance catalysts for overall seawater splitting. The strongly electronegative F anion is favorable to build weak metal fluorine bonds, which easily break to generate highly active species of Ni/Co&#8208;hydroxides/oxyhydroxides protective layer on the electrode surface. This process effectively avoids chlorine evolution reaction (ClER)&#8208;induced dissolution, and enhances the stability of catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the electronegative fluorine affects the electronic structure of the catalyst&#8217; surface, further enhancing the adsorption energy and electronic conductivity of the reaction intermediates. F&#8208;NiCoPS with appropriate F doping significantly decreased the overpotential (228 (303) mV at 10 (100) mA cm&#8208;2) and the Tafel slope (44 mV dec&#8208;1) in alkaline seawater, and exhibited a long stability of 100 h. This work provides new insights for constructing effective, cost&#8208;efficient and non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalyst for alkaline seawater splitting.</dc:description>
