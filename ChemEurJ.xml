         <title>Geometrically Mismatched Hydrogen&#8208;bonded Framework Composed of Tetratopic Carboxylic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous organic frameworks possessing interactive free sites in the pore have attracted much attention due to their potential to show the site&#8208;originated specific functionalities. Herein, we demonstrate that such a framework could be constructed using a concept of geometrically mismatched frameworks composed of phenanthroline&#8208;based tetratopic carboxylic acid  CP&#8208;Phen  . Simple recrystallization of  CP&#8208;Phen  yielded a solvent included porous framework  CP&#8208;Phen&#8208;1  , in which three of four carboxy groups form hydrogen&#8208;bonded dimer to form a ladder&#8208;shaped framework, while the remained one does not participate in framework formation due to geometrical mismatch and interacts with solvent molecules through weak hydrogen&#8208;bonding. This result implies that our proposed strategy is effective to provide free interactive sites in porous frameworks. Although  CP&#8208;Phen&#8208;1  undergoes two&#8208;step structural transformation accompanied by hydrogen&#8208;bond rearrangements upon loss of solvent molecules, the activate framework shows good thermal stability up to 360 &#176;C and selective CO  2  adsorption.</dc:description>

         <title>Four&#8208;Step Spin Crossover in a New Cyano&#8208;Bridged Iron&#8208;Silver Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new guest&#8208;free Hofmann clathrate analogue Fe(2&#8208;ethoxypyrazine)2{Ag(CN)2}2 which undergoes a four&#8208;step spin crossover during the transition from the low&#8208;spin to the high&#8208;spin state is reported. At the first step 1/3 of centers become high spin, at the second step another 1/3 of centres become high spin, at the third step spin mixed crystallographic centres are observed, and after the fourth step all centers are high spin.







Abstract
Spin&#8208;crossover complexes with multistep transitions attract much attention due to their potential applications as multi&#8208;switches and for data storage. A four&#8208;step spin crossover is observed in the new iron(II)&#8208;based cyanometallic guest&#8208;free framework compound Fe(2&#8208;ethoxypyrazine)2{Ag(CN)2}2 during the transition from the low&#8208;spin to the high&#8208;spin state. A reverse process occurs in three steps. Crystallographic studies reveal an associated stepwise evolution of the crystal structures. Multiple transitions in the reported complex originate from distinct FeII sites which exist due to the packing of the ligand with a bulky substituent.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis and Biological Applications of Peptidoglycan Fragments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptidoglycan, the material comprising the cell wall of bacteria, remains an attractive but complex synthetic target for enzymologists and immunologists. This review encompasses the various modern synthetic organic and chemoenzymatic routes for the formation of molecular peptidoglycan and the derivatives thereof: muramyl dipeptides, Park nucleotides, peptidoglycan lipids, and peptidoglycan fragments.







Abstract
The biosynthesis, breakdown, and modification of peptidoglycan (PG) play vital roles in both bacterial viability and in the response of human physiology to bacterial infection. Studies on PG biochemistry are hampered by the fact that PG is an inhomogeneous insoluble macromolecule. Chemical synthesis is therefore an important means to obtain PG fragments that may serve as enzyme substrates and elicitors of the human immune response. This review outlines the recent advances in the synthesis and biochemical studies of PG fragments, PG biosynthetic intermediates (such as Park's nucleotides and PG lipids), and PG breakdown products (such as muramyl dipeptides and anhydro&#8208;muramic acid&#8208;containing fragments). A rich variety of synthetic approaches has been applied to preparing such compounds since carbohydrate, peptide, and phospholipid chemical methodologies must all be applied.

         <title>A Catalyst and Solvent Free Route for the Synthesis of N&#8208;Substituted Pyrrolidones from Levulinic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work offers a simple methodolgy to avoid solvents and added catalysts for the synthesis of different kinds of N&#8208;substituted pyrrolidones. Different aniline derivatives with varying steric and electronic demands, aliphatic amines and benzyl amines were responsive to this methodology. The method was also modified for the synthesis of industrially important &#947;&#8208;valerolactone. Control experiments and DFT studies have also been carried out to find out the possible mechanistic pathway.







Abstract
An efficient, metal&#8208;free, catalyst&#8208;free and solvent&#8208;free methodology for the reductive amination of levulinic acid with different anilines has been developed using HBpin as the reducing reagent. This protocol offers an excellent method to avoid solvents and added catalysts on the synthesis of different kinds of N&#8208;substituted pyrrolidones under metal free conditions. It is also the first report for the synthesis of different pyrrolidones by solvent&#8208;free as well as catalyst&#8208;free methods. The proposed mechanism for the formation of pyrrolidone has been supported by DFT calculations and control experiments.

         <title>Dihydroxy&#8208;Acid Dehydratases From Pathogenic Bacteria: Emerging Drug Targets to Combat Antibiotic Resistance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The FeS cluster&#8208;dependent dihydroxy&#8208;acid dehydratases (DHADs) from Staphylococcus aureus and Campylobacter jejuni (SaDHAD and CjDHAD) are emerging targets for biocides. They are virtually inactive after extraction, but a functional [4Fe&#8722;4S] cluster can be reconstituted in vitro boosting the activity up to &#8764;19,000&#8208;fold.







Abstract
There is an urgent global need for the development of novel therapeutics to combat the rise of various antibiotic&#8208;resistant superbugs. Enzymes of the branched&#8208;chain amino acid (BCAA) biosynthesis pathway are an attractive target for novel anti&#8208;microbial drug development. Dihydroxy&#8208;acid dehydratase (DHAD) is the third enzyme in the BCAA biosynthesis pathway. It relies on an Fe&#8722;S cluster for catalytic activity and has recently also gained attention as a catalyst in cell&#8208;free enzyme cascades. Two types of Fe&#8722;S clusters have been identified in DHADs, i.e. [2Fe&#8722;2S] and [4Fe&#8722;4S], with the latter being more prone to degradation in the presence of oxygen. Here, we characterise two DHADs from bacterial human pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus and Campylobacter jejuni (SaDHAD and CjDHAD). Purified SaDHAD and CjDHAD are virtually inactive, but activity could be reversibly reconstituted in vitro (up to &#8764;19,000&#8208;fold increase with kcat as high as &#8764;6.7&#8197;s&#8722;1). Inductively&#8208;coupled plasma&#8208;optical emission spectroscopy (ICP&#8208;OES) measurements are consistent with the presence of [4Fe&#8722;4S] clusters in both enzymes. N&#8208;isopropyloxalyl hydroxamate (IpOHA) and aspterric acid are both potent inhibitors for both SaDHAD (Ki=7.8 and 51.6&#8197;&#956;M, respectively) and CjDHAD (Ki=32.9 and 35.1&#8197;&#956;M, respectively). These compounds thus present suitable starting points for the development of novel anti&#8208;microbial chemotherapeutics.

Here, we characterise two DHADs from bacterial human pathogens, &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter jejuni&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Sa&lt;/i&gt;DHAD and &lt;i&gt;Cj&lt;/i&gt;DHAD). Purified &lt;i&gt;Sa&lt;/i&gt;DHAD and &lt;i&gt;Cj&lt;/i&gt;DHAD are virtually inactive, but activity could be reversibly reconstituted in vitro (up to &#8764;19,000-fold increase with &lt;i&gt;k&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; as high as &#8764;6.7&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Inductively-coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) measurements are consistent with the presence of [4Fe&#8722;4S] clusters in both enzymes. N-isopropyloxalyl hydroxamate (IpOHA) and aspterric acid are both potent inhibitors for both &lt;i&gt;Sa&lt;/i&gt;DHAD (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;=7.8 and 51.6&#8197;&#956;M, respectively) and &lt;i&gt;Cj&lt;/i&gt;DHAD (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;=32.9 and 35.1&#8197;&#956;M, respectively). These compounds thus present suitable starting points for the development of novel anti-microbial chemotherapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>C&#8722;X Bond Activation by Palladium: Steric Shielding versus Steric Attraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulk up! Our computational study shows how increasing steric bulk at the C&#8722;X bond systematically decreases the bond strength along the series C(0&#176;)&#8722;X to C(1&#176;)&#8722;X to C(2&#176;)&#8722;X to C(3&#176;)&#8722;X. These weaker C&#8722;H and C&#8722;C bonds are not always more reactive in oxidative addition reactions with palladium catalysts. Instead, we illustrate the interplay between steric repulsion across the C&#8722;X bond versus that of the catalyst and substrate.







Abstract
The C&#8722;X bond activation (X = H, C) of a series of substituted C(n&#176;)&#8722;H and C(n&#176;)&#8722;C(m&#176;) bonds with C(n&#176;) and C(m&#176;) = H3C&#8722; (methyl, 0&#176;), CH3H2C&#8722; (primary, 1&#176;), (CH3)2HC&#8722; (secondary, 2&#176;), (CH3)3C&#8722; (tertiary, 3&#176;) by palladium were investigated using relativistic dispersion&#8208;corrected density functional theory at ZORA&#8208;BLYP&#8208;D3(BJ)/TZ2P. The effect of the stepwise introduction of substituents was pinpointed at the C&#8722;X bond on the bond activation process. The C(n&#176;)&#8722;X bonds become substantially weaker going from C(0&#176;)&#8722;X, to C(1&#176;)&#8722;X, to C(2&#176;)&#8722;X, to C(3&#176;)&#8722;X because of the increasing steric repulsion between the C(n&#176;)&#8208; and X&#8208;group. Interestingly, this often does not lead to a lower barrier for the C(n&#176;)&#8722;X bond activation. The C&#8722;H activation barrier, for example, decreases from C(0&#176;)&#8722;X, to C(1&#176;)&#8722;X, to C(2&#176;)&#8722;X and then increases again for the very crowded C(3&#176;)&#8722;X bond. For the more congested C&#8722;C bond, in contrast, the activation barrier always increases as the degree of substitution is increased. Our activation strain and matching energy decomposition analyses reveal that these differences in C&#8722;H and C&#8722;C bond activation can be traced back to the opposing interplay between steric repulsion across the C&#8722;X bond versus that between the catalyst and substrate.

         <title>Dibenzophenazine&#8208;Based TADF Emitters as Dual Electrochromic and Electroluminescence Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The change of donors in CT&#8208;based molecules significantly influences the charge carrier generation and follow&#8208;up reactions that affect the TADF emitter&#8216;s stability. The TADF emitters can be easily electropolymerised, forming stable conjugated polymers. Electrochemically active TADF emitters possess significant electrochromic properties and can be used as both electrochromic and electroluminescence materials. The dual behaviour of the TADF emitters allows use in both OLED and Electrochromic Windows applications.







Abstract
Previous work has reported the synthesis of donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor molecules based on dibenzophenazine acceptor group, presenting thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) properties and their application in the assembly of highly efficient electroluminescent devices. Herein, we focus on the characterisation of charge carrier species through UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR spectroelectrochemical and potentiostatic EPR techniques, in addition to the investigation of electropolymerisation properties of some compounds depicted in this study. The promising electrochromic features of both small molecules and conjugated polymers led to the assembly and investigation of electrochromic devices, evidencing the materials&#8217; versatility, applied in such different approaches as electrochromic windows and electroluminescent devices. Furthermore, the assembled OLEDs provided high efficiencies, with small roll&#8208;off, EQEs up to 20.5&#8201;% and luminance values up to 85 000 cd/m2.

         <title>Electrochemical Behaviour and Chemical Species of Sm(II) in AlCl3&#8208;NaCl with Different Lewis Acidity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sm(II) diffuses faster with the increase of Lewis acidity of AlCl3&#8208;NaCl, which is due to the different coordination circumstance of Sm(II). With the Lewis acidity increase, the anions involved in Sm(II) complexation gradually range from Cl&#8722; to AlCl4&#8722; and Al2Cl7&#8722;. The difference of complex structure is also reflected in the in&#8197;situ UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectrum.







Abstract
AlCl3&#8208;NaCl was utilized as an electrolyte in this work due to its low melting point and Lewis acidity, in which samarium exists in two oxidation states, Sm(III) and Sm(II), resulting in unique electrochemical behaviours. Sm metal dissolves in AlCl3&#8208;NaCl melt to form SmCl2, which is verified by electrochemical and spectroscopic techniques. As the Lewis acidity of the melt increases, the diffusion coefficient of Sm(II) gradually increases, and the activation energy of diffusion decreases. Moreover, an additional co&#8208;reduction peak of Sm3+ and AlCl4&#8722; is observed to be more positive than that of Al(0)/Al(III) in Lewis basic melt, which may be tightly correlated with the variation of Sm(II) coordination in AlCl3&#8208;NaCl melt and ligand variation from Cl&#8722; to AlCl4&#8722; and Al2Cl7&#8722; as the Lewis acidity of the AlCl3&#8208;NaCl melt increases, according to the in&#8197;situ electronic absorption spectra of Sm in this melt.

         <title>Rh(III)&#8208;Catalyzed One&#8208;Step Synthesis of ortho&#8208;Alkynylated Perylene Imide Dyes: Optical and Electrochemical Properties of New Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the first one&#8208;step synthesis of alkynylated perylene diimides, monoimides and alkynylated naphthalene monoimides through a Rh&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;selective ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H alkynylation. This not only increases the step economy of the ortho&#8208;functionalization on these dyes but also provides a quick access route towards highly functionalized dyes that have potential optoelectronic applications. Additionally, we have also explored optical properties of ortho&#8208;functionalized perylene diimide (PDI) and perylene monoimide (PMI) and compared the results obtained from the steady&#8208;state, time&#8208;resolved and circular voltammetry in both solution and solid&#8208;state. We also estimated the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PDI, PMI and their derivatives using cyclic voltammetry and UV&#8208;onset, respectively. The highly electron&#8208;deficient character (lower LUMO energy level) along with their significant quantum yield in the solid&#8208;state, make these PDI and PMI derivatives very strong and potential candidates for applications in optoelectronic devices like solar cells.







Abstract
A one&#8208;step Rh&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;selective ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H alkynylation of perylene as well as naphthalene mono&#8208; and diimides is reported. A single step regioselective access to ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H alkynylated derivatives of these ryleneimides not only increases the step economy of the ortho&#8208;functionalization on these dyes but also provides a quick access route towards highly functionalized dyes that have potential optoelectronic applications.

     alt="Rh(III)-Catalyzed One-Step Synthesis of ortho-Alkynylated Perylene Imide Dyes: Optical and Electrochemical Properties of New Derivatives"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work reports the first one-step synthesis of alkynylated perylene diimides, monoimides and alkynylated naphthalene monoimides through a Rh-catalyzed site-selective &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-C&#8722;H alkynylation. This not only increases the step economy of the &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-functionalization on these dyes but also provides a quick access route towards highly functionalized dyes that have potential optoelectronic applications. Additionally, we have also explored optical properties of &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-functionalized perylene diimide (PDI) and perylene monoimide (PMI) and compared the results obtained from the steady-state, time-resolved and circular voltammetry in both solution and solid-state. We also estimated the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PDI, PMI and their derivatives using cyclic voltammetry and UV-onset, respectively. The highly electron-deficient character (lower LUMO energy level) along with their significant quantum yield in the solid-state, make these PDI and PMI derivatives very strong and potential candidates for applications in optoelectronic devices like solar cells.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A one-step Rh-catalyzed site-selective &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-C&#8722;H alkynylation of perylene as well as naphthalene mono- and diimides is reported. A single step regioselective access to &lt;i&gt;ortho-&lt;/i&gt;C&#8722;H alkynylated derivatives of these ryleneimides not only increases the step economy of the &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-functionalization on these dyes but also provides a quick access route towards highly functionalized dyes that have potential optoelectronic applications. Increased solubility of tetra(triisopropylsilyl)acetylenyl PDIs in organic solvents greatly enhances their utility for further derivatization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design Concepts of Transition Metal Dichalcogenides for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are widely investigated as cathodes for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) due to their facile 2D Zn&#8208;ion transport channels and weak electrostatic interactions with Zn2+. This concept article discusses the latest design strategies of TMDs cathodes for high&#8208;performance AZIBs from the aspects of Zn&#8208;storage mechanism optimization, interlayer expansion, phase transition, and structure defects creation.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are considered as promising large&#8208;scale energy storage devices due to their high safety and low cost. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) as the potential aqueous Zn&#8208;storage cathode materials are under the research spotlight because of their facile 2D ion&#8208;transport channels and weak electrostatic interactions with Zn2+. In this concept article, we summarize the intrinsic structural features and aqueous Zn&#8208;storage mechanisms of the TMDs&#8208;based electrodes. More significantly, the latest design concepts of TMDs materials for high&#8208;performance AZIBs are discussed in detail from three aspects of interlayer expansion engineering, phase transition engineering, and structure defects engineering. Finally, the current challenges facing TMDs cathodes and possible remedies are outlined for future developments towards efficient, rapid, and stable aqueous Zn&#8208;ion storage.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Switchable Complexes Based on Nanographene&#8208;NHCs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanographene&#8208;functionalized NHC ligand was prepared and coordinated to rhodium an iridium. The presence of a perylene&#8208;diimide moiety in the ligand allows that the resulting complexes show redox&#8208;switching properties in the [3+2] cycloaddition of diphenylcyclopropenone and methylphenylacetylene.







Abstract
A series of rhodium and iridium complexes with a N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand decorated with a perylene&#8208;diimide&#8208;pyrene moiety are described. Electrochemical studies reveal that the complexes can undergo two successive one&#8208;electron reduction events, associated to the reduction of the PDI moiety attached to the NHC ligand. The reduction of the ligand produces a significant increase on its electron&#8208;donating character, as observed from the infrared spectroelectrochemical studies. The rhodium complex was tested in the [3+2] cycloaddition of diphenylcyclopropenone and methylphenylacetylene, where it displayed a redox&#8208;switchable behavior. The neutral complex showed moderate activity, which was suppressed when the catalyst was reduced.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Sensing of Acidic Catecholamine Metabolites Using a Programmable Nanopore</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three acidic catecholamine metabolites, including 3,4&#8208;dihydroxymandelic acid (DHMA), 3&#8208;methoxy&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxymandetic acid (VMA) and 3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) were investigated by PNRSS. DHMA, which contains an &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylate moiety (red shade, marked as 1) and an adjacent cis&#8208;hydroxyl groups on the benzene ring (blue shade, marked as 2), reports two binding modes (PBA&#8208;1 and PBA&#8208;2) simultaneously resolvable by PNRSS, demonstrating a high resolution of PNRSS. A custom machine learning algorithm was also developed to achieve automatic event classification.







Abstract
Acidic catecholamine metabolites, which could serve as diagnostic markers for many diseases, demonstrate an importance of accurate sensing. However, they share a highly similar chemical structure, which is a challenge in the design of sensing strategies. A nanopore may be engineered to sense these metabolites in a single molecule manner. To achieve this, a recently developed programmable nano&#8208;reactor for stochastic sensing (PNRSS) technique adapted with a phenylboronic acid (PBA) adaptor was applied. Three acidic catecholamine metabolites, including 3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), 3,4&#8208;dihydroxymandelic acid (DHMA) and 3&#8208;methoxy&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxymandetic acid (VMA) were investigated by PNRSS. Specifically, DHMA, which contains an &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylate moiety and an adjacent cis&#8208;hydroxyl groups on its benzene ring, reports two binding modes simultaneously resolvable by PNRSS. Assisted with the high resolution of PNRSS, direct regulation of these two binding modes by pH can also be observed. A custom machine learning algorithm was also developed to achieve automatic event classification.

         <title>Layered Uranyl Phosphonates Encapsulating Co(II)/Mn(II)/Zn(II) Ions: Exfoliation into Nanosheets and Its Impact on Magnetic and Luminescent Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered heterometallic uranyl phosphonates [(UO2)3M(2&#8208;pmbH)4(H2O)4]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O [MU, M=Co(II), CoU; Mn(II), MnU; Zn(II), ZnU] can be exfoliated into nanosheets with single/two&#8208;layer thickness (MU&#8208;ns). Comparing to the bulk crystalline samples, the aggregates of nanosheets exhibited significant differences in magnetic dynamics (for CoU) and photoluminescence (for ZnU).







Abstract
Layered heterometallic 5f&#8211;3d uranyl phosphonates can exhibit unique luminescent and/or magnetic properties, but the fabrication and properties of their 2D counterparts have not been investigated. Herein we report three heterobimetallic uranyl phosphonates, namely, [(UO2)3M(2&#8208;pmbH)4(H2O)4]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O [MU, M=Co(II), CoU; Mn(II), MnU; Zn(II), ZnU; 2&#8208;pmbH3=2&#8208;(phosphonomethyl)benzoic acid]. They are isostructural and display two&#8208;dimensional layered structures where the M(II) centers are encapsulated inside the windows generated by the diamagnetic uranyl phosphonate layer. Each M(II) has an octahedral geometry filled with four water molecules in the equatorial positions and two phosphonate oxygen atoms in the axial positions. The uranium atoms adopt UO7 pentagonal bipyramidal and UO6 square bipyramidal geometries. The lattice and coordination water molecules can be released by thermal treatment and reabsorbed in a reversible manner, accompanied with changes of magnetic dynamics. Interestingly, the bulk samples of MU can be exfoliated in acetone via freezing and thawing processes forming nanosheets with single&#8208;layer or two&#8208;layer thickness (MU&#8208;ns). Magnetic studies revealed that the CoU and MnU systems exhibited field&#8208;induced slow magnetization relaxation at low temperature. Compared with crystalline CoU, the magnetic relaxation of the CoU&#8208;ns aggregates is significantly accelerated. Moreover, photoluminescence measured at 77&#8197;K showed slight red&#8208;shift of the five characteristic uranyl emission bands for ZnU&#8208;ns in comparison with those of the crystalline ZnU. This work gives the first examples of 2D materials based on 5f&#8211;3d heterometallic uranyl phosphonates and illustrates the impact of dimension reduction on their magnetic/optical properties.

Compared with crystalline &lt;b&gt;CoU&lt;/b&gt;, the magnetic relaxation of the &lt;b&gt;CoU-ns&lt;/b&gt; aggregates is significantly accelerated. Moreover, photoluminescence measured at 77&#8197;K showed slight red-shift of the five characteristic uranyl emission bands for &lt;b&gt;ZnU-ns&lt;/b&gt; in comparison with those of the crystalline &lt;b&gt;ZnU&lt;/b&gt;. This work gives the first examples of 2D materials based on 5f&#8211;3d heterometallic uranyl phosphonates and illustrates the impact of dimension reduction on their magnetic/optical properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Improvement of Visible&#8208;Light H2 Evolution Activity of Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 Photocatalyst by Coloading of Rh and Pd Cocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced H2 evolution activity of a Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 photocatalyst was found to be sensitive to the loaded metal cocatalyst. Although Rh was the most effective single&#8208;metal cocatalyst among the tested metals, the activity of Rh/Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 was further improved by coloading of Pd because it reinforced the ability of Rh to capture photogenerated electrons from Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2.







Abstract
Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 modified with various metal cocatalysts was studied as a photocatalyst for visible&#8208;light H2 evolution. Although unmodified Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 showed negligible activity, modification of its surface with Rh led to the best observed promotional effect among the Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 samples modified with a single metal cocatalyst. The H2 evolution activity was further enhanced by coloading with Pd; the Rh&#8722;Pd/Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 photocatalyst showed 3.2 times greater activity than the previously reported Pt/Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2. X&#8208;ray absorption fine&#8208;structure spectroscopy, photoelectrochemical, and transient absorption spectroscopy measurements indicated that the coloaded Rh and Pd species, which were partially alloyed on the Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 surface, improved the electron&#8208;capturing ability, thereby explaining the high activity of the coloaded Rh&#8722;Pd/Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 catalyst toward H2 evolution.

The compound  1  exhibited highly sensitive photoreactivity with a large molar absorption coefficient of 8.2 &#215; 10  4  M  &#8211;1  cm  &#8211;1  and practically photon&#8208;quantitative photocyclization. On the other hands, terarylene derivatives with a planar aromatic phenanthrene, 9,10&#8208;bis(2,4&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;phenylthiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)phenanthrene (  4  ) showed no photoreactivity.

         <title>When Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Meets Perovskites: Efficient Defect&#8208;Passivation and Charge&#8208;Transfer for Ambient Fabrication of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
In this work, incorporating donor&#8208;acceptor structured AIE molecule (TPE&#8208;TCF) into the perovskite precursor solution can improve the morphology of perovskite film and suppress nonradiative carrier recombination, leading to perovskite solar cells with reduced trap density and negligible hysteresis. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of TPE&#8208;TCF&#8208;treated PSCs achieved a remarkably enhanced from 15.63 to 19.66&#8201;% with high charge transport and defects passivation under air condition without a glovebox.







Abstract
The intrinsic defects in perovskite film can serve as non&#8208;radiative recombination center to limit the performance and stability of metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The additive engineering in perovskite film is always applied to produce high&#8208;efficiency PSCs in recent years. Here, a typical donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) structured aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) molecule tetraphenylethene&#8208;2&#8208;dicyano&#8208;methylene&#8208;3&#8208;cyano&#8208;4,5,5&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;dihydrofuran (TPE&#8208;TCF) was introduced into perovskite film. The D&#8722;A structure of TPE&#8208;TCF molecule provided additional charge transfer channels, contributing to transporting electron of TPE&#8208;TCF&#8208;based device. The cyano (C&#8801;N) of TPE&#8208;TCF can interact with the uncoordinated Pb to from a relatively stable intermediate, PbI2&#8901;TPE&#8208;TCF, resulting in the slower crystal growth, reduced the defects at the grain boundaries and suppressed carrier recombination. As a consequence, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of TPE&#8208;TCF&#8208;modified PSCs achieved a remarkably enhanced from 15.63 to 19.66&#8201;% with negligible hysteresis, which was prominent in methylammonium lead iodide&#8208;based devices fabricated under ambient condition. Furthermore, the PSCs modified by AIE molecule possessed an outstanding stability and maintain about 86&#8201;% of the initial PCE after 300&#8197;h storage in air at 25&#8211;35&#8201;&#176;C with a high relative humidity (RH) of &#8776;85&#8201;%. This work suggests that incorporating AIE molecule into perovskite is a promising strategy for facilitating high&#8208;performance PSCs commercialization in ambient environment without glovebox.

         <title>Mechanistic and Kinetic Investigations of ON/OFF (photo)switchable Binding of Carbon Monoxide by Chromium(0), Molybdenum(0) and Tungsten(0) Carbonyl Complexes with a Pyridyl&#8208;Mesoionic Carbene Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work tackles the photochemistry of a series of mononuclear Cr(0), Mo(0) and W(0) carbonyl complexes containing a bidentate mesoionic carbene ligand of the 1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;5&#8208;ylidene type. FTIR spectroscopy, combined with density functional theory calculations, reveals a clean photo&#8208;induced reaction in organic solvents (acetonitrile, pyridine, valeronitrile) to mainly one photoproduct with monosubstitution of a carbonyl ligand for a solvent molecule. The highest photodissociation quantum yields are reached for the Cr(0) complex under UV irradiation (266 nm). Based on previous investigations, the kinetics of the dark reverse reactions are now determined, with reaction times of up to several hours in pyridine. Photochemical studies in solid state (KBr matrix, frozen solution) also show light&#8208;induced reactivity with stabilization of the metastable intermediate with a free coordination site at very low temperature. The identified reactive species emphasizes a mechanism without ligand&#8208;sphere reorganization.</dc:description>

         <title>Layered Oxide Cathodes Promoted by Crystal Regulation Strategies for Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layered oxide cathodes have demonstrated great potential for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) on account of high reversible capacity, appropriate diffusion paths, and low cost. However, their electrochemical performance in PIBs is generally worse than that in lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to large structural changes and deformations during charging and discharging. To improve their potassium storage performance, a series of strategies have been developed in recent studies. In this review, we summarize the latest advancements in layered oxide cathodes for PIBs through different crystal regulation strategies, including transition metal layer doping, potassium content optimization, oxygen partial substitution, functional morphology construction and air stability improvement. Meanwhile, the relationship between the electrochemical properties and structural evolution of these modified cathodes is also investigated. In addition, the challenges and prospects of these layered oxide cathodes in PIBs are analyzed in detail, providing constructive insights for future applications of PIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Activation of Imines by Chalcogen Bond Donors in a&#160;Povarov [4+2] Cycloaddition Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, chalcogen bonding has been investigated in more detail in organocatalysis and the scope of activated functionalities continues to increase. Herein, the activation of imines in a Povarov [4+2] cycloaddition reaction with bidentate cationic chalcogen bond donors is presented. Tellurium&#8208;based Lewis acids show superior properties compared to selenium&#8208;based catalysts and inactive sulfur&#8208;based analogues. The catalytic activity of the chalcogen bonding donors increases with weaker binding anions. Triflate, however, is not suitable due to its participation in the catalytic pathway. A solvent screening revealed a more efficient activation in less polar solvents and a pronounced effect of solvent (and catalyst) on  endo:exo  diastereomeric ratio. Finally, new chiral chalcogen bonding catalysts were applied but provided only racemic mixtures of the product.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks: Functionalized Construction Strategy by Nitrogen&#8208;Containing Functional Group</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strategies and applications of nitrogen&#8208;containing functional groups to construct hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) materials: selectivity of pore modification effects of nitrogen&#8208;containing functional groups in gas adsorption separation and guest recognition applications, nitrogen&#8208;modification of framework to promote HOFs for sensing applications in optics, and biocompatibility of nitrogen&#8208;containing functional groups to advance the biomedical field of HOF materials.







Abstract
The construction of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework materials by intermolecular hydrogen bonding forces has been rapidly developed in the last decade, among which, the strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding and functional binding sites exhibited by nitrogen&#8208;containing functional groups have made them favorites for designing organic components to customize functionalized porous materials. This review systematically introduces the types of nitrogen&#8208;containing monomers used to prepare porous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic backbones and the principles of their construction, summarizes the design advantages of crystalline materials from an elemental perspective, and presents the applications of such HOFs in the fields of gas adsorption/separation, molecular recognition, plasmonic conductivity, biomedical, and luminescent materials, etc. Finally, the prospects for the development of such materials are discussed and potential directions for future work are analyzed.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Detergent Expansion Strategy for Membrane Protein Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
T&#8208;PADs for membrane proteins: A library of 1,2,3&#8208;triazole preassembled detergents (T&#8208;PADs) was constructed two&#8208;dimensionally by click chemistry, exhibiting high diversity with systematic tuning of properties for accommodating distinct membrane proteins. High throughput screening of this detergent library was carried out to explore best matches between detergents and membrane proteins. Among them, structurally unique and unprecedented detergents 14M8G and 14M9G were identified for the EM and NMR study of individual membrane proteins, respectively.







Abstract
Detergents are the most frequently applied reagents in membrane protein (MP) studies. The limited diversity of one&#8208;head&#8208;one&#8208;tailed traditional detergents, however, is far from sufficient for structurally distinct MPs. Expansion of detergent repertoire has a continuous momentum. In line with the speculation that detergent pre&#8208;assembly exerts superiority, herein we report for the first time cross&#8208;conjugation of two series of monomeric detergents for constructing a two&#8208;dimensional library of dimeric detergents. Optimum detergents stood out with unique preferences in the systematic evaluation of individual MPs. Furthermore, unprecedented hybrid detergents 14M8G and 14M9G enabled high&#8208;quality EM study of transporter MsbA and NMR study of G protein&#8208;coupled receptor A2AAR, respectively. Given the abundance of cross&#8208;coupling chemistries, comprehensive diversity could be readily covered that would facilitate the finding of new detergents for the manipulation of thorny MPs and innovation of the functional and structural study in future.

         <title>Reductive Elimination at Pb(II) Center of an (Amino)plumbylene&#8208;Substituted Phosphaketene: New Pathway for Phosphinidene Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable (amino)plumbylene&#8208;substituted phosphaketene was synthesized by the successive reactions of PbCl2 with two anionic reagents (lithium amidophosphine and NaPCO). Of particular interest, its thermal evolution, initiated at 80&#8201;&#176;C, starts with reductive elimination at the PbII center to form a new N&#8722;P bond and leads to the generation of a transient (amino)phosphaketene, which is the precursor of a new cyclic (amino)phosphanylidene phosphorane. This result provides a new synthetic route to phosphinidenes, extending and facilitating further their access.







Abstract
A stable (amino)plumbylene&#8208;substituted phosphaketene 3 was synthesized by the successive reactions of PbCl2 with two anionic reagents (lithium amidophosphine and NaPCO). Of particular interest, the thermal evolution of 3, at 80&#8201;&#176;C, leads to the transient formation of corresponding amino&#8208; and phosphanylidene&#8208;phosphaketenes (6 and 7), via a reductive elimination at the PbII center forming new N&#8722;P and P&#8722;P bonds. Further evolution of 6 gives a new cyclic (amino)phosphanylidene phosphorane 4, which shows a unique reactivity as a phosphinidene. This result provides a new synthetic route to phosphinidenes, extending and facilitating further their access.

This result provides a new synthetic route to phosphinidenes, extending and facilitating further their access.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Color&#8208;Tunable Multifunctional Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer Emitter: Stimulated Emission of a Single Dye</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single 2&#8208;(2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)benzothiazole derivative is capable of precisely tunable triple&#8208;emission, covering the whole visible spectrum (red&#8208;green&#8208;blue). Excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) phenomenon was utilized to fabricate multifunctional active material for lasing action both in solutions and in thin polymeric films. For the first time, light amplification in deprotonated ESIPT species was observed, enabling real&#8208;time shifting of the stimulated emission by almost 100&#8197;nm (from orange to green).







Abstract
The excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer chromophores were regarded as good materials for laser action generation due to their inherent four&#8208;level photocycle. The excitation&#8208;dependent properties of these compounds enable light amplification from two distinct forms: both enol and keto, making it possible to obtain dual fluorescence emission. Herein, we report that a third option is possible for the first time stimulated emission was realized with a deprotonated ESIPT molecule based on a novel rigidified 2&#8208;(2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)benzothiazole derivative, triggering the possibility to fabricate real&#8208;time tunable active material. Through the rational engineering of the ratio of each emissive species, a red&#8208;green&#8208;blue device was fabricated with the possibility of white light generation. The degenerated two&#8208;wave mixing setup was applied to construct a continuously tunable distributed feedback laser.

         <title>Tailoring the NIR&#8208;II Photoluminescence of Single Thiolated Au25 Nanoclusters by Selective Binding to Proteins
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sometimes what glisters is gold: We have succeeded in incorporating a single atomically precise gold nanocluster (Au25) inside bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein. A striking increase in Au25&#8208;BSA NIR&#8208;II photoluminescence is observed compared to that from Au25. The results reveal an intricate role of protein rigidification and the involvement of the surface state in the generation of NIR&#8208;II emissions.







Abstract
Atomically precise gold nanoclusters are a fascinating class of nanomaterials that exhibit molecule&#8208;like properties and have outstanding photoluminescence (PL). Their ultrasmall size, molecular chemistry, and biocompatibility make them extremely appealing for selective biomolecule labeling in investigations of biological mechanisms at the cellular and anatomical levels. In this work, we report a simple route to incorporate a preformed Au25 nanocluster into a model bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein. A new approach combining small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and molecular modeling provides a clear localization of a single Au25 within the protein to a cysteine residue on the gold nanocluster surface. Attaching Au25 to BSA strikingly modifies the PL properties with enhancement and a redshift in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window. This study paves the way to conrol the design of selective sensitive probes in biomolecules through a ligand&#8208;based strategy to enable the optical detection of biomolecules in a cellular environment by live imaging.

You can&#8242;t separate this couple: One of the azo&#8208;substituted tripycenes synthesized in this work is highlighted in front of its UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectrum. Even though the azobenzenes are separated by a sp3 center, they experience excitonic coupling, as illustrated by the lightning. More information can be found in the Research Article by H.&#8197;A.

         <title>Cucurbit[7]uril Inhibits Islet Amyloid Polypeptide Aggregation by Targeting N&#8197;Terminus Hot Segments and Attenuates Cytotoxicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) self&#8208;assembly is responsible for the decline of pancreatic &#946;&#8208;cells, which is implicated in type II diabetes. The macrocyclic host, cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]), effectively inhibits IAPP aggregation through ion&#8211;dipole and hydrophobic interactions with different residues of the monomeric peptide in its primary random&#8208;coil conformation. Most importantly, CB[7] rescues rat insulinoma cells (a robust pancreatic &#946;&#8208;cell model) from IAPP&#8208;assembly&#8208;associated cytotoxicity. More information can be found in the Research Article by D. Maity, A.&#8197;D. Hamilton, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200456).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work we report the first cycloaddition reactions between a diazido diborane(4) and terminal alkynes, providing unique access to bis&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles connected by a B&#8208;B bridge. The catalyst&#8208;free reactions are highly selective, yielding exclusively the thermodynamically disfavored bis&#8208;1,4&#8208;triazoles. The reactions are enabled by the high thermal stability of the diazido&#8208;diborane [B(hpp)(N  3  )]  2  (hpp = 1,3,4,6,7,8&#8209;hexahydro&#8208;2  H  &#8208;pyrimido[1,2&#8208;&#945;]pyrimidinate). Due to the tetra&#8208;coordinate boron atoms in this reagent, the reactions are tolerant with respect to the introduction of Lewis&#8208;basic groups at the alkyne. The scope and limitations of the new reactions are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Striking Size and Doping Effects of Ti&#8208;Si&#8208;O Clusters on Methane Conversion Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The size and doping effects in methane activation by Ti&#8208;Si&#8208;O clusters have been explored by using a combination of gas&#8208;phase experiments and quantum chemical calculations. All      [Ti  m  Si  n  O  2(m+n)  ]  &#8226;+    (m + n = 2, 3, 8, 10, 12, 14)   clusters can extract a hydrogen from methane. The associated energies and structures have been revealed in detail. Moreover, the doping and size effects have been discussed involving Generalized Kohn&#8208;Sham energy decomposition analysis, Natural Population Analysis, Wiberg bond indexes (WBI), molecular polarity index (MPI) and ionization potential (IP). It suggested that Ti&#8208;Si&#8208;O clusters with a low Ti:Si ratio is beneficial to adsorbing methane and inclination to the Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT) process, while the clusters with a high Ti:Si ratio favors the generation of a terminal oxygen radical and results in high reactivity and turnover frequency. On the other hand, a cluster size of m + n= 12 is recommended considering both the ionization potential and the turnover frequency of the reaction. Hopefully, these finding will be instructive for the design of high&#8208;performance Ti&#8208;Si&#8208;O catalyst toward methane conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>The key role of a&#8208;top CO on terrace sites of metallic Pd clusters for CO oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pd&#8208;based catalysts are the most widely used for CO oxidation because of their outstanding catalytic activity and thermal stability. However, the fundamental understanding of the detailed catalytic processes on Pd&#8208;based catalysts under realistic conditions is still not fully understood. In this study, we investigated CO oxidation on metallic Pd clusters supported on Al  2  O  3  and SiO  2  . High&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy revealed a similar average size of Pd clusters on Al  2  O  3  and SiO  2  . In contrast, CO chemisorption exhibits gradual changes in dispersion (0.79 to 0.2) on Pd/Al  2  O  3  and a marginal change in dispersion (0.4 to 0.24) for Pd/SiO  2  as the Pd loading increases from 0.27 to 5.5 wt%, which is attributed to the difference in the metal&#8208;support interaction. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier&#8208;transform spectroscopy experiments revealed that Pd supported on Al  2  O  3  exhibited a relatively lower a&#8208;top CO than Pd supported on SiO  2  , which is related to the morphological differences in metallic Pd clusters between these two supports. Despite the different dispersion profiles and surface characteristics of Pd, O  2  titration on CO&#8208;saturated Pd on Al  2  O  3  and SiO  2  demonstrated that linearly bound CO at 2090 cm  &#8208;1  reacted first with oxygen, which suggests that this a&#8208;top CO on terrace site plays an important role in CO oxidation. This experimental observation was elucidated by periodic density functional calculations, which confirmed that CO oxidation is most plausible both kinetically and thermodynamically on terrace (111) sites compared to edge or corner sites. We believe the finding in this work will helps the fundamental understanding of the effect of Pd on CO oxidation under the reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular, Interrupted Homo&#8208;Nazarov Cascade Biscyclizations to Angular (Hetero)Aryl&#8208;Fused Polycycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, a SnCl4 &#8208;catalyzed intramolecular, interrupted homo&#8208;Nazarov cascade biscyclization to access angular (hetero)aryl&#8208;fused polycycles is reported. Subsequent decarboxylation of the readily enolizable products afforded the angular products in up to 71% yield over two steps, with the trans&#8208;diastereomers as the major products. The cyclopropyl homo&#8208;Nazarov cyclization precursors were formed using a scalable and modular synthetic route that, ultimately, offers access to 6,6,6&#8208;, 6,6,5&#8208;, 6,5,6&#8208;, 6,6,5,6&#8208;, and 6,6,6,5&#8208;fused angular polycyclic products. To showcase the rigor and utility of the method, an 8&#8208;step total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;1&#8208;oxoferruginol, an antibacterial aromatic abietane diterpenoid, was disclosed.</dc:description>

         <title>General Designing Strategy of Anti&#8208;aromatic Porphyrinoids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A systematic investigation to arrange the typical anti&#8208;aromatic porphyrinoids in sequence was performed. Based on density functional theory calculations, six rules are summarized to obtain the high&#8208;performance anti&#8208;aromatic porphyrinoids: (1) when two atoms are deleted/added on the 18p electron current ring flowing pipe, we will immediately obtain a 16p/20p electron anti&#8208;aromatic system; (2) it is a good idea to increase the number of pyrrol/thiophen/furan units on the p electron current ring flowing pipe; (3) the hetroatom selecting order is &#8208;O&#8208; (optimal choice), &#8208;NH&#8208; (second choice), and &#8208;S&#8208; (last choice); (4) it is worth noting that the C&#8208;C=C&#8208;C unit is not beneficial for the anti&#8208;aromatic properties; (5) it is very significant to avoid the crowded environment in the core space of an anti&#8208;aromatic molecule. In this view, &#8208;O&#8208; is much better than &#8208;S&#8208; and &#8208;NH&#8208;; (6) the &#8220;circular&#8221; skeleton is much better than an &#8220;ellipse&#8208;like&#8221;, &#8220;rectangular&#8221;, or &#8220;parallelogram&#8208;like&#8221; one.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclic Disulfide Liposomes for Membrane Functionalization and Cellular Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liposomes are effective therapeutic delivery nanocarriers due to their ability to encapsulate and enhance the pharmacokinetic properties of wide&#8208;ranging therapeutics. Two primary areas in which improvement is needed for liposomal drug delivery is to enhance the ability to infiltrate cells and to easily functionalize the liposome surface. Herein, we report a liposome platform incorporating a cyclic disulfide lipid (CDL) for the dual purpose of enhancing cell entry and functionalizing the liposome membrane through thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange. In order to accomplish this,  CDL&#8208;1  and  CDL&#8208;2  , composed of lipoic acid (LA) or asparagusic acid (AA) appended to a lipid scaffold, were designed and synthesized. A fluorescence&#8208;based microplate immobilization assay was implemented to show that these compounds enable convenient membrane decoration through reaction with thiol&#8208;functionalized small molecules. Additionally, fluorescence microscopy experiments indicated dramatic enhancements in cellular delivery when CDLs were incorporated within liposomes. These results demonstrate that multifunctional CDLs serve as an exciting liposome system for surface decoration and enhanced cellular delivery.</dc:description>

Herein, we report a liposome platform incorporating a cyclic disulfide lipid (CDL) for the dual purpose of enhancing cell entry and functionalizing the liposome membrane through thiol-disulfide exchange. In order to accomplish this,  CDL-1  and  CDL-2  , composed of lipoic acid (LA) or asparagusic acid (AA) appended to a lipid scaffold, were designed and synthesized. A fluorescence-based microplate immobilization assay was implemented to show that these compounds enable convenient membrane decoration through reaction with thiol-functionalized small molecules. Additionally, fluorescence microscopy experiments indicated dramatic enhancements in cellular delivery when CDLs were incorporated within liposomes. These results demonstrate that multifunctional CDLs serve as an exciting liposome system for surface decoration and enhanced cellular delivery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Impact of Fluoroalkyl Substituents on Physicochemical Properties of Saturated Heterocyclic Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Profiling of the physicochemical properties (p  K  a  ,  log  P  , and aqueous solubility) of fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted heterocyclic amines was done to facilitate their rational application in medicinal chemistry research. The corresponding features of fluorine&#8208;containing compounds were compared to the parent non&#8208;fluorinated hetero&#173;cycles and the corresponding fluorinated  n  &#8208;alkylamines. Amine basicity was observed to change in a monotonic fashion depending on the fluorination pattern. Although the introduction of fluoroalkyl groups had complex effects on lipophilicity and aqueous solubility of the compounds, possible contributions of the fluorination pattern, ring size, and conformational fixation of the substituent in the ring were addressed for a series of derivatives. The summarized data provides a useful guideline for application of fluorinated motifs for fine&#8208;tuning the compound&#8217;s properties related to drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Perfluoroalkylation of C&#8722;H Bonds in (Hetero)arenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perfluoroalkylated (hetero)arenes represent an extremely important family of molecules. Among all methods available for their preparation, the direct perfluoroalkylation of C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds in (hetero)arenes is the most attractive and straightforward one, provided that it proceeds with high levels of regioselectivity. In this review article, a comprehensive overview of advances in this field is presented, with a special focus on the reaction mechanisms involved in these transformations and their regioselectivity.







Abstract
Perfluoroalkylated (hetero)arenes represent an extremely important family of molecules commonly utilized in many areas such as medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry and material sciences. Due to their unique properties, they have attracted significant interest from synthetic chemists and various methods have been developed for their synthesis. Among them, the direct perfluoroalkylation of C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds in (hetero)arenes is one of the most attractive and straightforward ones, provided that it proceeds with high levels of regioselectivity. In this review article, a comprehensive overview of advances in this field is presented, with a special focus on the reaction mechanisms involved in these transformations and their regioselectivity. All methods available have been classified according to the nature of the perfluoroalkyl chain introduced, trifluoromethylation reactions being overviewed in a separate section, and to the nature of the reagents/catalysts required.

         <title>Halogenation and Nucleophilic Quenching: Two Routes to E&#8722;X Bond Formation in Cobalt Triple&#8208;Decker Complexes (E=As, P; X=F, Cl, Br, I)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rooting out new routes: Halogenation of the neutral compound [(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)2(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;As2)2] leads to cationic species containing a cyclic As4X ligand (X=I, Br, Cl). The same cation can be obtained when a nucleophilic halide source such as KI is used to &#8221;quench&#8220; the Lewis acidity of an oxidised starting material, the dication [(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)2(&#956;,&#951;4&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;4&#8208;As4)]2+. Extended to Pn ligand complexes, this new approach allows the formation of products containing P&#8722;F bonds without the use of stronger fluorinating reagents such as XeF2.







Abstract
The oxidation of [(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)2(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;E2)2] (E=As (1), P (2); Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;=1,2,4&#8208;tri(tert&#8208;butyl)cyclopentadienyl) with halogens or halogen sources (I2, PBr5, PCl5) was investigated. For the arsenic derivative, the ionic compounds [(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)2(&#956;,&#951;4&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;4&#8722;As4X)][Y] (X=I, Y=[As6I8]0.5 (3&#8201;a), Y=[Co2Cl6&#8208;nIn]0.5 (n=0, 2, 4; 3&#8201;b); X=Br, Y=[Co2Br6]0.5 (4); X=Cl, Y=[Co2Cl6]0.5 (5)) were isolated. The oxidation of the phosphorus analogue 2 with bromine and chlorine sources yielded the ionic complexes [(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)2(&#956;&#8208;PBr2)2(&#956;&#8208;Br)][Co2Br6]0.5 (6&#8201;a), [(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)2(&#956;&#8208;PCl2)2(&#956;&#8208;Cl)][Co2Cl6]0.5 (6&#8201;b) and the neutral species [(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)2(&#956;&#8208;PCl2)(&#956;&#8208;PCl)(&#956;,&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;1&#8208;P2Cl3] (7), respectively. As an alternative approach, quenching of the dications [(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)2(&#956;,&#951;4&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;4&#8208;E4)][TEF]2 (TEF=[Al{OC(CF3)3}4]&#8722;, E=As (8), P (9)) with KI yielded [(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)2(&#956;,&#951;4&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;4&#8208;As4I)][I] (10), representing the homologue of 3, and the neutral complex [(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;CoI2)(&#956;,&#951;4&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;1&#8208;P4)] (11), respectively. The use of [(CH3)4N]F instead of KI leads to the formation of [(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)2(&#956;&#8208;PF2)(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;1&#8208;P3F2)] (12) and 2, thereby revealing synthetic access to polyphosphorus compounds bearing P&#8722;F groups and avoiding the use of very strong fluorinating reagents, such as XeF2, that are difficult to control.

         <title>Asymmetric 1,2&#8208;Carbamoyl Rearrangement of Lithiated Chiral Oxazolidine Carbamates and Diastereoselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Amides</title>

         <dc:description>
Asymmetric 1,2&#8208;carbamoyl rearrangement of chiral 2&#8208;alkenyl oxazolidine carbamates were investigated. These rearrangements provided &#945;&#8208;hydroxy amide derivatives with excellent diastereoselectivity and in good to excellent isolated yields. The substrate scope of the reaction was examined with a variety of 2&#8208;alkenyl and benzyl oxazolidine carbamates. The observed high degree of diastereoselectivity was rationalized using a stereochemical model.







Abstract
Asymmetric 1,2&#8208;carbamoyl rearrangement of lithiated 2&#8208;alkenyl carbamates has been investigated. Deprotonation of chiral 2&#8208;alkenyl oxazolidine carbamates with sec&#8208;butyllithium in ether at &#8722;78&#8201;&#176;C followed by warming of the resulting 1&#8208;lithio&#8208;2&#8208;alkenyl derivatives to room temperature resulted in 1,2&#8208;carbamoyl rearrangement to provide &#945;&#8208;hydroxy amides. The rearrangement proceeded with excellent diastereoselectivity and in good to excellent isolated yield of the &#945;&#8208;hydroxy amide derivatives. The substrate scope of the reaction was investigated with a variety of 2&#8208;alkenyl and benzyl oxazolidine carbamates. A stereochemical model is provided to explain the stereochemical outcome associated with the rearrangement. Acid&#8208;catalyzed removal of the chiral oxazolidine afforded &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acid in high optical purity.

         <title>Pressure Effects on 3dn (n=4, 9) Insulating Compounds: Long Axis Switch in Na3MnF6 not Due to the Jahn&#8208;Teller Effect</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By means of first principles calculations, this work shows that the usual explanation for the long axis switch induced by pressure in low symmetry compounds containing 3dn (n=4, 9) ions, i.&#8201;e., the Jahn&#8208;Teller effect, cannot be considered since in the parent phase the symmetry constraints are not fulfilled. However, the reported results for Na3MnF6 reveal that the pressure&#8208;induced switch arises from the anisotropic response of the low symmetry lattice to hydrostatic pressure, leading to a change of the electronic wavefunction.







Abstract
The pressure&#8208;induced switch of the long axis of MnF63&#8722; units in the monoclinic Na3MnF6 compound and Mn3+&#8208;doped Na3FeF6 is explored with the help of first principles calculations. Although the switch phenomenon is usually related to the Jahn&#8208;Teller effect, we show that, due to symmetry reasons, it cannot take place in 3dn (n=4, 9) systems displaying a static Jahn&#8208;Teller effect. By contrast, we prove that in Na3MnF6 the switch arises from the anisotropic response of the low symmetry lattice to hydrostatic pressure. Indeed, while the long axis of a MnF63&#8722; unit at ambient pressure corresponds to the Mn3+&#8722;F3&#8722; direction, close to the crystal c axis, at 2.79&#8197;GPa the c axis is reduced by 0.29&#8197;&#197; while b is unmodified. This fact is shown to force a change of the HOMO wavefunction favoring that the long axis becomes the Mn3+&#8722;F2&#8722; direction, not far from crystal b axis, after the subsequent relaxation process. The origin of the different d&#8208;d transitions observed for Na3MnF6 and CrF2 at ambient pressure is also discussed together with changes induced by pressure in Na3MnF6. The present work opens a window for understanding the pressure effects upon low symmetry insulating compounds containing d4 or d9 ions.

         <title>Muon Spin Rotation/Resonance (&#181;SR) for Studying Radical Reactivity of Unsaturated Organophosphorus Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The positive muon (  &#181;  +  ) can be regarded as a light isotope of proton and has been an important tool to study radical reactions of organic compounds. Recently, muons have been applied to produce short&#8208;lived paramagnetic species from the heavier unsaturated organic molecules including the p&#8208;block elements. This article overviews recent muon spin resonance/rotation (&#181;SR) studies on the phosphorus analogs of alkenes, anthracenes, and cyclobutane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyls together with the fundamentals of &#181;SR. The acyclic phosphaalkene of P=C and phosphasilenes of P=Si can accept muonium (Mu = [  &#181;  +  e  &#8211;  ]) at the heavier double bonds, and the corresponding radicals have been characterized. The phosphorus atom in 9&#8208;phosphaanthracene, whose P=C double bond is stabilized by the  peri  &#8208;substituted CF  3  groups, predominantly captures muonium to provide the corresponding paramagnetic fused heterocyclic system. The  peri&#8208;  trifluoromethyl groups are functional to promote the unprecedented light isotope effect of muon providing the planar three&#8208;cyclic molecular structure to consume the increased zero&#8208;point energy. The formally open&#8208;shell singlet 1,3&#8208;diphosphacyclobutane&#8208;2,4&#8208;diyl unit can accept muonium at the (ylidic) phosphorus or the skeletal radicalic carbon, and the corresponding paramagnetic phosphorus heterocycles can be characterized by &#181;SR. The findings on these muoniation processes to the unsaturated phosphorus&#8208;containing compounds will contribute not only to development of novel paramagnetic functional species but also to progress on muon science.</dc:description>

         <title>[2+3] Amide Cages by Oxidation of [2+3] Imine Cages &#8208; Revisiting Molecular Hosts for Highly Efficient Nitrate Binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pollution of groundwater with nitrate is a serious issue because nitrate can cause several diseases such as methemoglobinemia or cancer. Therefore, selective removal of nitrate by efficient binding to supramolecular hosts is highly desired. Here we describe how to make [2+3] amide cages in very high to quantitative yields by applying an optimized Pinnick oxidation protocol for the conversion of corresponding imine cages. By NMR titration experiments of the eight different [2+3] amide cages with nitrate, chloride and hydrogen sulfate we identified one cage with an unprecedented high selectivity towards nitrate binding vs chloride (  S  = 705) or hydrogensulfate (  S  &gt;13500) in CD  2  Cl  2  /CH  3  CN (1:3). NMR experiments as well as single&#8208;crystal structure comparison of host&#8208;guest complexes give insight into structure&#8208;property&#8208;relationships.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New N &#8208;heterocyclic compounds for organic functional materials and their efficient syntheses are highly demanded. A surprising entropy&#8208;induced selectivity switch in the gold&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular hydroarylation of 2&#8208;ethynyl N &#8208;aryl indoles was found and its exploitation led to straightforward syntheses of indolo[1,2&#8208; a ]quinolines. Experimental and computational mechanistic investigations gave insight into this uncommon selectivity phenomenon and into the special reactivity of the indolo[1,2&#8208; a ]quinolines. The high functional group tolerance of this methodology enabled access to a diverse scope in high yields. In addition, bidirectional approaches, post&#8208;functionalizations, and &#960;&#8208;extension of the core structure were feasible. An in&#8208;depth study of the photophysical properties explored the structure&#8208;effect relationship for different derivatives and revealed a high potential of these compounds for future applications as functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Iron Catalyzed Synthesis of N&#8208;alkylated Indolines and Indoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Whereas iron catalysts usually promote catalyzed C3&#8208;alkylation of indole derivatives  via  borrowing&#8208;hydrogen methodology using alcohols as the electrophilic partners, this contribution shows how to switch the selectivity towards N&#8208;alkylation. Thus starting from indoline derivatives, N&#8208;alkylation was efficiently performed using a tricarbonyl(cyclopentadienone) iron complex as the catalyst in trifluoroethanol in the presence of alcohols leading to the corresponding N&#8208;alkylated indoline derivatives in 31&#8208;99% yields (28 examples). It is then shown a one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step strategy, for the selective N&#8208;alkylation of indolines then their oxidations, leading to the corresponding N&#8208;alkylated indoles in 31&#8208;90% yields (15 examples). This unprecedented oxidation methodology involves an iron salt catalyst associated to TEMPO and a stoichiometric amount of  t&#8208;  BuOOH at RT.</dc:description>

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization of Peptides on the Solid Phase by an Iodination&#8208;Substitution Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The functionalization of peptides at the late synthesis stage holds great potential, for example for the synthesis of peptide pharmaceutica, fluorescent biosensors or peptidomimetics among others. Here we describe an on&#8208;resin iodination&#8208;substitution reaction sequence on homoserine that is also suitable for peptide modification in a combinatorial format. The reaction sequence is accessible to a wide range of sulfur nucleophiles with various functional groups including boronic acids, hydroxyl groups or aromatic amines. In this way, methionine&#8208;like thioethers or thioesters and thiosulfonates are accessible. Next to sulfur nucleophiles, selenols, pyridines and carboxylic acids were successfully used as nucleophiles, whereas phenols did not react. The late&#8208;stage iodination&#8208;substitution approach is not only applicable to short peptides but also to the more complex 34 amino acid WW domains. We applied this strategy to introduce 7&#8208;mercapto&#8208;4&#8208;methylcoumarin into a switchable Zn(II) responsive WW domain to design an iFRETbased Zn(II) sensor.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Photo&#8208;thermo catalysis utilizing light has been a promising strategy to improve the conventional thermal catalytic activity and attracts great attention nowadays. However, how heat works in synergy with light radiation is still unclear. This  &#8220;concept&#8221;  is  trying to clarify the specific contents via summarizing the kinetic studies including (  &#8560;) proposing elementary steps through pressure dependence studies, (&#8561;) estimating reaction barriers through measuring the apparent activation energies and (&#8562;) assigning the kinetically relevant step(s) with kinetic isotope effects (KIE) as well as (&#8563;) exploring the relationship of the reaction rate with the light excitation wavelength and light intensity. The challenges in kinetic studies such as describing the light&#8208;induced carrier transfer process, the surface temperature under light illumination as well as reaction intermediates were discussed at the same time. Finally, an outlook about kinetic studies in clarifying the photo&#8208;thermo catalysis reaction mechanism was proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Bench&#8208;Stable Dinuclear Mn(I) Catalysts in E&#8208;Selective Alkyne Semihydrogenation: A Mechanistic Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dinuclear manganese hydride complexes of the form [Mn 2 (CO) 8 ( &#181; &#8208;H)( &#181; &#8208;PR 2 )] (R = Ph, 1 ; R = i Pr, 2 ) were used in E &#8208;selective alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation ( E &#8208;SASH) catalysis. Catalyst speciation studies revealed rich coordination chemistry and the complexes thus formed were isolated and in turn tested as catalysts; the results underscoring the importance of dinuclearity in engendering the observed E &#8208;selectivity and provide insights into the nature of the active catalyst. The insertion product obtained from treating 2 with (cyclopropylethynyl)benzene contains a cis &#8208;alkenyl bridging ligand with cyclopropyl ring intact. Treatment of this complex with H 2 affords exclusively trans &#8208;(2&#8208;cyclopropylvinyl)benzene. These results, in addition to other control experiments, indicate a non&#8208;radical mechanism for E &#8208;SASH, which is highly unusual for Mn&#8211;H catalysts. The catalytically actives species are virtually inactive towards cis to trans alkene isomerization indicating that the E &#8208;selective process is intrinsic and dinuclear complexes play a critical role. A reaction mechanism is proposed accounting for the observed reactivity which is fully consistent with a kinetic analysis of the rate limiting step and is further supported by DFT computations.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) have attracted extensive attention owing to their high theoretical capacity. However, the uncontrolled volume changes and serious Li dendrites growth of Li metal anode have hindered their commercialization. Herein, a three&#8208;dimensional Cu foam decorated with Au nanoparticles and conformal graphene layer was designed to tune the Li plating/stripping behaviors by electroless deposition and chemical vapor deposition. The 3D&#8208;Cu conductive hosts anchored by lithiophilic Au nanoparticles can effectively alleviate the volume expansion caused by the continuous plating/stripping of Li and reduce the nucleation energy barrier. Notably, the conductive graphene not only facilitates the transfer of electrons, but also acts as an ionic rectifier, thereby avoiding the aggregation of local current density and Li  +  ions around Au nanoparticles and enabling the uniform Li  +  flux. As a result, the G&#8208;Au@3D&#8208;Cu/Li anode ensures the non&#8208;dendritic and homogeneous Li  +  plating/stripping. Electrochemical results show that the symmetric G&#8208;Au@3D&#8208;Cu/Li cell delivers a low voltage hysteresis of 110 mV after 1000 h at 1 mA cm  &#8722;2  . Matched with a layered LiNi  0.6  Co  0.2  Mn  0.2  O  2  cathode, the NCM622&#9553;G&#8208;Au@3D&#8208;Cu/Li full cell exhibits a long cycle life of 2000 cycles and an ultra&#8208;low capacity decay rate (0.01% per cycle).</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Borylation of Acyl Chlorides with an Alkoxy Diboron Reagent: A Facile Route to Acylboron Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper&#8208;catalyzed borylation of acyl chlorides with B2pin2 in the presence of LiOt&#8208;Bu at room temperature provides a convenient synthetic approach to various acylboron compounds with good functional group tolerance. The synthetic utility is demonstrated by the late&#8208;stage derivatization of drug molecules and the ease of scale&#8208;up. A catalytic mechanism is proposed based on in&#8197;situ reaction monitoring and the structural characterization of a key acylboronate intermediate and a novel Cu complex byproduct.







Abstract
Herein, the copper&#8208;catalyzed borylation of readily available acyl chlorides with bis(pinacolato)diboron, (B2pin2) or bis(neopentane glycolato)diboron (B2neop2) is reported, which provides stable potassium acyltrifluoroborates (KATs) in good yields from the acylboronate esters. A variety of functional groups are tolerated under the mild reaction conditions (room temperature) and substrates containing different carbon&#8208;skeletons, such as aryl, heteroaryl and primary, secondary, tertiary alkyl are applicable. Acyl N&#8208;methyliminodiacetic acid (MIDA) boronates can also been accessed by modification of the workup procedures. This process is scalable and also amenable to the late&#8208;stage conversion of carboxylic acid&#8208;containing drugs into their acylboron analogues, which have been challenging to prepare previously. A catalytic mechanism is proposed based on in&#8197;situ monitoring of the reaction between p&#8208;toluoyl chloride and an NHC&#8208;copper(I) boryl complex as well as the isolation of an unusual lithium acylBpinOBpin compound as a key intermediate.

The synthetic utility is demonstrated by the late-stage derivatization of drug molecules and the ease of scale-up. A catalytic mechanism is proposed based on in&#8197;situ reaction monitoring and the structural characterization of a key acylboronate intermediate and a novel Cu complex byproduct.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, the copper-catalyzed borylation of readily available acyl chlorides with bis(pinacolato)diboron, (B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;pin&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) or bis(neopentane glycolato)diboron (B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;neop&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is reported, which provides stable potassium acyltrifluoroborates (KATs) in good yields from the acylboronate esters. A variety of functional groups are tolerated under the mild reaction conditions (room temperature) and substrates containing different carbon-skeletons, such as aryl, heteroaryl and primary, secondary, tertiary alkyl are applicable. Acyl &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methyliminodiacetic acid (MIDA) boronates can also been accessed by modification of the workup procedures. This process is scalable and also amenable to the late-stage conversion of carboxylic acid-containing drugs into their acylboron analogues, which have been challenging to prepare previously. A catalytic mechanism is proposed based on in&#8197;situ monitoring of the reaction between &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-toluoyl chloride and an NHC-copper(I) boryl complex as well as the isolation of an unusual lithium acylBpinOBpin compound as a key intermediate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Neutron Diffraction Study of Indole Solvation in Deep Eutectic Systems of Choline Chloride, Malic Acid, and Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solvation of indole in choline chloride:malic acid deep eutectic solvents is shown by neutron diffraction with isotopic substitution and atomistic modelling to vary with water content. Latent water does little, whereas adding 2&#8197;mole of equivalents of water causes interactions, not with the &#960;&#8208;system of indole, but via hydrophobic hydration and H&#8208;bonding in&#8208;plane with the heterocyclic rings. These results may therefore explain trends in heterocycle reactivity and selectivity.







Abstract
Deep eutectic systems are currently under intense investigation to replace traditional organic solvents in a range of syntheses. Here, indole in choline chloride&#8208;malic acid deep eutectic solvent (DES) was studied as a function of water content, to identify solute interactions with the DES which affect heterocycle reactivity and selectivity, and as a proxy for biomolecule solvation. Empirical Potential Structure Refinement models of neutron diffraction data showed [Cholinium]+ cations associate strongly with the indole &#960;&#8208;system due to electrostatics, whereas malic acid is only weakly associated. Trace water is sequestered into the DES and does not interact strongly with indole. When water is added to the DES, it does not interact with the indole &#960;&#8208;system but is exclusively in&#8208;plane with the heterocyclic rings, forming strong H&#8208;bonds with the &#8208;NH group, and also weak H&#8208;bonds and thus prominent hydrophobic hydration of the indole aromatic region, which could direct selectivity in reactions.

A gem of a reaction: The first examples of stepwise (Pd) or direct (Ni) metal&#8208;promoted double geminal activation of C
&#8722;H bonds leading to imidazole&#8208;type N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene metal pincer complexes under mild conditions are presented.







Abstract
We report the first examples of metal&#8208;promoted double geminal activation of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds of the N&#8722;CH2&#8722;N moiety in an imidazole&#8208;type heterocycle, leading to nickel and palladium N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complexes under mild conditions. Reaction of the new electron&#8208;rich diphosphine 1,3&#8208;bis((di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphaneyl)methyl)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole (1) with [PdCl2(cod)] occurred in a stepwise fashion, first by single C&#8722;H bond activation yielding the alkyl pincer complex [PdCl(PC
HP)] (3) with two trans phosphane donors and a covalent Pd&#8722;C
 bond. Activation of the C&#8722;H bond of the resulting &#945;&#8208;methine C
H&#8722;M group occurred subsequently when 3 was treated with HCl to yield the NHC pincer complex [PdCl(PCNHCP)]Cl (2). Treatment of 1 with [NiBr2(dme)] also afforded a NHC pincer complex, [NiBr(PCNHCP)]Br (6), but the reactions leading to the double geminal C&#8722;H bond activation of the N&#8722;CH2&#8722;N group were too fast to allow identification or isolation of an intermediate analogous to 3. The determination of six crystal structures, the isolation of reaction intermediates and DFT calculations provided the basis for suggesting the mechanism of the stepwise transformation of a N&#8722;CH2&#8722;N moiety in the N&#8722;CNHC&#8722;N unit of NHC pincer complexes and explain the key differences observed between the Pd and Ni chemistries.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Halogen&#8208;Atom Transfer: Generation of Halide Radicals for Selective Hydrohalogenation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first photo&#8208;mediated process enabling the generation of halide radicals by halogen&#8208;atom transfer (XAT) is described. This novel reactivity pattern relies on the use of 1,2&#8208;dihaloethanes for the generation of unstable carbon radicals by XAT, which after &#946;&#8208;scission, release halide radicals that have been used in selective hydrohalogenations of unsaturated hydrocarbons.







Abstract
The first photo&#8208;mediated process enabling the generation of halide radicals by Halogen&#8208;Atom Transfer (XAT) is described. Contrary to radical transformations involving XAT reactivity, which exploit stable carbon radicals, this unique approach uses 1,2&#8208;dihaloethanes for the generation of unstable carbon radicals by XAT. These transient radicals then undergo &#946;&#8208;scission with release of ethylene and formation of more stable halide radicals which have been used in selective hydrohalogenations of a large number of unsaturated hydrocarbons, including Michael acceptors, unactivated alkenes and alkynes. This hydrohalogenation is tolerant of a broad range of functionalities and is believed to proceed through a radical&#8208;chain manifold that propagates by the use of silane derivatives.

         <title>Intense Photoinduced Intervalence Charge Transfer in High&#8208;Valent Iron Mixed Phenolate/Carbene Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The usefulness of high&#8208;valent iron(NHC) chromophores is based on long&#8208;lived, ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) states. However, short&#8208;lived, metal&#8208;centered states may be populated if the ligands are not strong enough donors. We show that, thanks to metal&#8208;ligand covalency, iron ions can bridge ligand&#8211;ligand electronic communication, promoting ligand&#8208;based photoinduced intervalence charge transfer (PIIVCT) bands: spectroscopic markers in the usually silent NIR region that allow the interconversion between LMCT&#8208; and metal&#8208;centered states to be monitored.







Abstract
We report high&#8208;valent iron complexes supported by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;anchored, bis&#8208;phenolate pincer ligands that undergo ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) upon photoexcitation. The resulting excited states &#8211; with a lifetime in the picosecond range &#8211; feature a ligand&#8208;based, mixed&#8208;valence system and intense intervalence charge transfer bands in the near&#8208;infrared region. Upon oxidation of the complex, corresponding intervalence charge transfer absorptions are also observed in the ground state. We suggest that the spectroscopic hallmarks of such LMCT states provide useful tools to decipher excited&#8208;state decay mechanisms in high&#8208;valent NHC complexes. Our observations further indicate that NHC&#8208;anchored, bis&#8208;phenolate pincer ligands are not sufficiently strong donors to prevent the population of excited metal&#8208;centered states in high&#8208;valent iron complexes.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Augmented Lithium Storage Capacity in a Ruthenium(II) Photosensitizer Conjugated with a Dione&#8208;Catechol Redox Couple</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New strategies to address climate change are more urgent than ever. A molecular metallo&#8208;organic bifunctional material with covalently attached photo&#8208;active and redox units led to synchronous light harvesting and energy storage functions. As cathode material in a two&#8208;electrode Li photo&#8208;battery configuration, the storage capacity increased by 100&#8201;%, under 470&#8197;nm illumination with output power of 4.0&#8197;mW/cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Controlling redox activity of judiciously appended redox units on a photo&#8208;sensitive molecular core is an effective strategy for visible light energy harvesting and storage. The first example of a photosensitizer &#8208; electron donor coordination compound in which the photoinduced electron transfer step is used for light to electrical energy conversion and storage is reported. A photo&#8208;responsive Ru&#8208;diimine module conjugated with redox&#8208;active catechol groups in [Ru(II)(phenanthroline&#8208;5,6&#8208;diolate)3]4&#8722; photosensitizer can mediate photoinduced catechol to dione oxidation in the presence of a sacrificial electron acceptor or at the surface of an electrode. Under potentiostatic condition, visible light triggered current density enhancement confirmed the light harvesting ability of this photosensitizer. Upon implementation in galvanostatic charge&#8208;discharge of a Li battery configuration, the storage capacity was found to be increased by 100&#8201;%, under 470&#8197;nm illumination with output power of 4.0&#8197;mW/cm&#8722;2. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept molecular system marks an important milestone towards a new generation of molecular photo&#8208;rechargeable materials.

         <title>Intramolecular (4+3) Cycloadditions of Oxidopyridinium Ions: Towards Daphnicyclidin A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
No strain, no gain: Studies of the intramolecular (4+3) cycloaddition reaction of oxidopyridinium ions led to the idea that the reaction might be applicable to daphnicyclidin A and related alkaloids. It was demonstrated that despite an increase in strain relative to cycloadducts we had been studying, the ABC ring system of daphnicyclidin A, including a quaternary center, could be synthesized in 6 steps in 36.5&#8201;% overall yield from commercially available 4&#8208;hydroxybutanone.







Abstract
N&#8208;alkylation of 5&#8208;hydroxynicotinic acid esters with electrophiles containing diene functionality produces salts that undergo intramolecular (4+3) cycloaddition reactions upon heating in the presence of base. Initial studies used a three&#8208;carbon tether to join the pyridinium ion and diene, revealing some aspects of the inherent selectivity of the reaction with such substrates. Much more challenging was the synthesis of related species possessing only a two&#8208;carbon tether. Nevertheless, the cycloaddition of such compounds was successful, leading directly to the ABC ring system of the alkaloid daphnicyclidin A.

         <title>Sequential Nucleophilic Substitution of Phosphorus Trichloride with Alcohols in a Continuous&#8208;Flow Reactor and Consideration of a Mechanism for Reduced Over&#8208;reaction through the Addition of Imidazole</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sequential nucleophilic substitution of phosphorus trichloride with alcohols has been achieved. Over&#8208;reaction was suppressed by rapid mixing through micro&#8208;flow technology, and asymmetric phosphotriesters containing acid&#8208; and/or base&#8208;labile functional groups were synthesized in good to high yields. Moreover, a mechanistic study by using DFT calculations suggested interesting reaction pathways. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Fuse and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200932).

         <title>Phosphorescence Induction by Host&#8208;Guest Complexation with Cyclodextrins &#8211; The Role of Regioisomerism and Affinity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present an in&#8208;depth investigation of cyclodextrin complexes with guest compounds featuring complexation&#8208;induced room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in aqueous solution. Very interestingly, only the complexed regioisomers bearing lateral substituents on meta&#8208;position are showing RTP, whereas the stronger host&#8208;guest systems with para&#8208;substituted dyes show no RTP features. The reported systems were investigated regarding their complexation behavior in water using isothermal titration calorimetry and mass spectrometry. In the case of &#947;&#8208;CD very strong 1:1 inclusion complexes (K  a  up to 5.13 x 10  5  M  &#8208;1  ) were unexpectedly observed. It was found that not only a strong binding to the cyclodextrin cavity is needed to restrict motion, inducing the emission, but also the conformation inside the cavity plays a pivotal role &#8211; as supported by an extensive NMR study and MD simulations.</dc:description>

The four&#8208;membered ring in [{M(dmpe)}  4  ]  4+  is slightly puckered for M = Ga and almost square planar for M = In. Yet, although structurally similar, only the gallium cluster is prevalent in solution, while the indium cluster forms temperature dependent equilibria that include even the monomeric cation [In(dmpe)]  +  . This system is the first report of one and the same ligand inducing formation of isoelectronic and isostructural gallium / indium cluster cations. The system allows to study systematically analogies and differences with thermodynamic considerations and bonding analyses, but also to outline perspectives for bond activation using cationic, subvalent group 13 clusters.</dc:description>

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Characterization of a New Visible Light&#8208;Sensitive Molecular Switch and its PEGylation Towards a Self&#8208;Assembling Molecule</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>HBDI&#8208;like chromophores represent a novel set of biomimetic switches mimicking the fluophore of the green fluorescent protein that are currently studied with the hope to expand the molecular switch/motor toolbox. However, until now members capable of absorbing visible light in their neutral (i.e. non&#8208;anionic) form have not been reported. In this contribution we report the preparation of a HBDI&#8208;like chromophore based on a 3&#8208;phenyl benzofulvene scaffold capable to absorb blue light and photoisomerize in the picosecond time scale. More specifically, we show that double bond photoisomerization occurs in both the E&#8208;to&#8208;Z and Z&#8208;to&#8208;E directions and that these can be controlled by irradiating with blue&#8208;light and UV light respectively. Finally, as a preliminary applicative result, we report the incorporation of the chromophore in an amphiphilic molecule and demonstrate the formation of a visible light&#8208;sensitive nanoaggregated state in water.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;HBDI-like chromophores represent a novel set of biomimetic switches mimicking the fluophore of the green fluorescent protein that are currently studied with the hope to expand the molecular switch/motor toolbox. However, until now members capable of absorbing visible light in their neutral (i.e. non-anionic) form have not been reported. In this contribution we report the preparation of a HBDI-like chromophore based on a 3-phenyl benzofulvene scaffold capable to absorb blue light and photoisomerize in the picosecond time scale. More specifically, we show that double bond photoisomerization occurs in both the E-to-Z and Z-to-E directions and that these can be controlled by irradiating with blue-light and UV light respectively. Finally, as a preliminary applicative result, we report the incorporation of the chromophore in an amphiphilic molecule and demonstrate the formation of a visible light-sensitive nanoaggregated state in water.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemically laminated 2D bis(terpyridine)metal polymer films: Formation mechanism at the liquid&#8208;liquid interface and redox rectification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent studies on molecular 2D materials with high tunability of structures and functions have focused mostly on discovery of new precursors. Here, we demonstrate a facile one&#8208;pot synthesis of laminated 2D coordination polymer films comprising bis(terpyridine)&#8208;iron and &#8208;cobalt at a water/dichloromethane interface. Cross&#8208;sectional elemental mapping unveils a stratum&#8208;like structure of the film and reveals that the second layer grows to the dichloromethane side below the first layer. A cyclic voltammogram clarifies that the bottom layer mediates charge transfer between the top layer and the substrate in a narrow potential region of mixed&#8208;valence states. Furthermore, the bilayer film sandwiched by electrodes in a dry condition shows stable rectification character and the barrier voltage corresponds to the redox potential difference of the two layers. The present study introduces a new strategy of polymer design to explore material science of molecular 2D materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Cephem&#8208;Pyrazinoic Acid Conjugates: Circumventing Resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading source of infectious disease mortality globally. Antibiotic&#8208;resistant strains comprise an estimated 10% of new TB cases and present an urgent need for novel therapeutics. &#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotics have traditionally been ineffective against M. tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of TB, due to the organism&#8217;s inherent expression of &#946;&#8208;lactamases that destroy the electrophilic &#946;&#8208;lactam warhead. We have developed novel &#946;&#8208;lactam conjugates, which exploit this inherent &#946;&#8208;lactamase activity to achieve selective release of pyrazinoic acid (POA), the active form of a first&#8208;line TB drug. These conjugates are selectively active against M. tuberculosis and related mycobacteria, and activity is retained or even potentiated in multiple resistant strains and models. Preliminary mechanistic investigations suggest that both the POA &#8220;warhead&#8221; as well as the &#946;&#8208;lactam &#8220;promoiety&#8221; contribute to the observed activity, demonstrating a codrug strategy with important implications for future TB therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Superacid&#8208;Mediated Late&#8208;Stage Aromatic Polydeuteration of Pharmaceuticals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The field of medicinal chemistry is currently witnessing a  deuterium rush  owing to the remarkable properties of this element as bioisoster of hydrogen atom. Aromatic hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) is one of the most studied strategies nowadays as it promises to access deuterium&#8208;modified drugs directly from their non&#8208;labeled parents. While most of the recent studies focus on metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H activation strategy, the use of superacidic conditions has been largely overlooked. Here, we show that the use of TfOD as reaction medium allows the late&#8208;stage polydeuteration of a broad library of pharmaceuticals bearing a wide array of functional groups, complementing existing procedures.</dc:description>

         <title>Facet Engineering on WO3 Mono&#8208;Particle&#8208;Layer Electrode for Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance of WO3 photoanode for water splitting is heavily influenced by the orientation of crystal facets. In this work, mono&#8208;particle&#8208;layer electrodes, assembled by particulate WO3 square plates with highly uniform alignment along (002) facet, improved PEC water oxidation kinetics and stability. Photo&#8208;deposition of Au along the cracks formed on the surface of the plates, which are the edges of {110} facets, was found to further enhance electron collection efficiency. Combination of these two strategies allowed the facet engineered WO3 electrode to produce significantly higher efficiencies in charge separation and transfer than the electrode prepared without facet orientation. This work has provided a facile route for fabricating structurally designed WO3 photoelectrode, which is also applicable to other regularly&#8208;shaped semiconductor photocatalysts with anisotropic charge migration.</dc:description>

Chemical economics! Highly substituted five&#8208;membered heterocyclic compounds were synthesized from unactivated 1,6&#8208;enynes and sulfonyl halides under metal, additive&#8208;free reaction conditions. These transformations can minimize chemical waste, save time, and simplify practical aspects compared to exiting protocols.







Abstract
We developed time&#8208;atom economic regio&#8208; and chemoselective sulfonyl radical triggered 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization of unactivated 1,6&#8208;enynes with sulfonyl halides under metal, additive&#8208;free reaction conditions to achieve highly substituted five&#8208;membered heterocyclic compounds. This transformation creates three new bonds, such as C&#8722;SO2, C&#8722;C, and active C&#8722;I/Br bonds. Importantly, one&#8208;pot protocols produce desired products directly from sodium sulfinates and have an additional advantage such as minimising chemical waste, saving time, and simplifying practical aspects compared to existing protocols.

         <title>Significant Effect of the Flexibility of Bridging Alkyl Chains on the Proximity of Stacked Porphyrin and Phthalocyanine Conjugated with a Fourfold Rotaxane Linkage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The flexibility of the bridging alkyl chains is important for proximity in the stacking of porphyrin and phthalocyanine conjugated through a fourfold rotaxane linkage. This picture shows a chochin, a Japanese lantern made with paper and thin strips of bamboo that can be expanded and contracted flexibly. This foldability recalls the induced molecular interaction in the flexible molecular conjugate. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Tanaka et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200819).

         <title>Mapping Catalyst&#8211;Solvent Interplay in Competing Carboamination/Cyclopropanation Reactions</title>

What will my product be? Selectivity and activity maps can be used to predict and rationalize reaction outcomes based on catalyst and solvent choice. Here, there utility is demonstrated by examining competing carboamination/cyclopropanation reactions catalyzed by Group 9 catalysts featuring cyclopentadienyl ligands, which reveals an interesting energetic interplay involving the role of the solvent and of the catalyst.







Abstract
Group 9 metals, in particular RhIII complexes with cyclopentadienyl ligands, are competent C&#8722;H activation catalysts. Recently, a Cp*RhIII&#8208;catalyzed reaction of alkenes with N&#8208;enoxyphthalimides showed divergent outcome based on the solvent, with carboamination favored in methanol and cyclopropanation in 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethanol (TFE). Here, we create selectivity and activity maps capable of unravelling the catalyst&#8208;solvent interplay on the outcome of these competing reactions by analyzing 42 cyclopentadienyl metal catalysts, CpXMIII (M=Co, Rh, Ir). These maps not only can be used to rationalize previously reported experimental results, but also capably predict the behavior of untested catalyst/solvent combinations as well as aid in identifying experimental protocols that simultaneously optimize both catalytic activity and selectivity (solutions in the Pareto front). In this regard, we demonstrate how and why the experimentally employed Cp*RhIII catalyst represents an ideal choice to invoke a solvent&#8208;induced change in reactivity. Additionally, the maps reveal the degree to which even perceived minor changes in the solvent (e.&#8201;g., replacing methanol with ethanol) influence the ratio of carboamination and cyclopropanation products. Overall, the selectivity and activity maps presented here provide a generalizable tool to create global pictures of anticipated reaction outcome that can be used to develop new experimental protocols spanning metal, ligand, and solvent space.

         <title>Chemically Modified Poly(A) Analogs Targeting PABP: Structure Activity Relationship and Translation Inhibitory Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oligonucleotide mRNA poly(A) tail analogs containing various nucleotide modifications were evaluated as binders for poly(A) binding protein (PABP) using a microscale thermophoresis&#8208;based assay. Their susceptibility to specific degradation by CNOT7 deadenylase was also examined in order to identify best stabilizing modifications. Analogs exhibiting highest affinity and stability were tested in rabbit reticulocyte lysate system and proved to act as efficient translational inhibitors with potential applications in mRNA&#8208;related research.







Abstract
Poly(A)&#8208;binding protein (PABP) is an essential element of cellular translational machinery. Recent studies have revealed that poly(A) tail modifications can modulate mRNA stability and translational potential, and that oligoadenylate&#8208;derived PABP ligands can act as effective translational inhibitors with potential applications in pain management. Although extensive research has focused on protein&#8208;RNA and protein&#8208;protein interactions involving PABPs, further studies are required to examine the ligand specificity of PABP. In this study, we developed a microscale thermophoresis&#8208;based assay to probe the interactions between PABP and oligoadenylate analogs containing different chemical modifications. Using this method, we evaluated oligoadenylate analogs modified with nucleobase, ribose, and phosphate moieties to identify modification hotspots. In addition, we determined the susceptibility of the modified oligos to CNOT7 to identify those with the potential for increased cellular stability. Consequently, we selected two enzymatically stable oligoadenylate analogs that inhibit translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysates with a higher potency than a previously reported PABP ligand. We believe that the results presented in this study and the implemented methodology can be capitalized upon in the future development of RNA&#8208;based biological tools.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Initiated Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;coupling by PPh3 Uncaging from an Azobenzene Ruthenium&#8211;Arene Complex</title>

Tuning by timing: The photo&#8208;initiation of Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling was achieved using a simple white LED combined with a triphenylphosphine ruthenium&#8211;arene complex bearing an azobenzene ligand. The strategy developed in this work involves the photo&#8208;controlled release of metal catalyst activator (PPh3) through Z&#8208;to&#8208;E azobenzene isomerization, thus generating competent Pd0 active species, and allows fine tuning of reaction kinetics according to irradiation time.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;release of triphenylphosphine from a sulfonamide azobenzene ruthenium&#8211;arene complex was exploited to activate PdIICl2 into Pd0 catalyst, for the photo&#8208;initiation of Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling. The transformation was initiated on demand &#8211; by using simple white LED strip lights &#8211; with a high temporal response and the ability to control reaction rate by changing the irradiation time. Various substrates were successfully applied to this photo&#8208;initiated cross&#8208;coupling, thus illustrating the wide functional&#8208;group tolerance of our photo&#8208;caged catalyst activator, without any need for sophisticated photochemistry apparatus.

         <title>Assembly of &#1013;&#8208;Keggin Polyoxometalate from Molecular Crystal to Zeolitic Octahedral Metal Oxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Investigating the formation process of zeolitic octahedral metal oxides (ZOMOs) shows that controlling Ni content, reducing agent, and synthesis time &#1013;&#8208;Keggin nickel molybdate&#8208;based ZOMOs or molecules. The zeolitic nickel molybdates are effective for C2 hydrocarbon separation.







Abstract
Zeolitic octahedral metal oxides are inorganic crystalline microporous materials with adsorption and redox properties. New &#1013;&#8208;Keggin nickel molybdate&#8211;based zeolitic octahedral metal oxides have been synthesized. 31P NMR spectroscopy shows that reduction of MoVI&#8208;based molybdates forms an &#1013;&#8208;Keggin polyoxometalate that immediately transfers to the solid phase. Investigation of the formation process indicates that a low Ni concentration, insoluble reducing agent, and long synthesis time are the critical factors for obtaining the zeolite octahedral metal oxides rather than the &#1013;&#8208;Keggin polyoxometalate molecule. The synthesized zeolitic nickel molybdate with Na+ is used as the adsorbent, which effectively separates C2 hydrocarbon mixtures.

         <title>The Significant Role of the Atomic Surface Structure of Support in Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
General strategies for tailoring SMSI, including classical SMSI, oxidative SMSI, and various SMSIs after complex treatments are summarized in this concept. Moreover, a new proposal, considering both the exposed facets of support and the interaction with gas, is presented to alter the property of the support to tune SMSI. With this strategy, the same support can vary its property to reducible, oxidative, or other complex properties.







Abstract
Supported metal catalysts are important in many industrial reactions. It is reported that support materials are not always inert, and in some cases could even interact with metal nanoparticles (NPs) actively via various ways. In particular, the strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI), referring to metal NPs covered by support materials, affects catalysis at the active sites on the metal NP surface, which can serve as a very effective method in tuning and improving catalytic performance. By tailoring the support materials or controlling the treatment processes, different kinds of SMSI, such as classical SMSI, oxidative SMSI, wet&#8208;chemistry SMSI, and adsorbate&#8208;mediated SMSI, can be achieved. This concept summarizes the general strategies to tune SMSI and discusses the key results. Moreover, a new proposal is presented to tailor SMSI by combining both the exposed facets of the support materials and external environments. Furthermore, the challenges faced at present are discussed and useful insights for future research concerning this topic are provided.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;General strategies&lt;/b&gt; for tailoring SMSI, including classical SMSI, oxidative SMSI, and various SMSIs after complex treatments are summarized in this concept. Moreover, a new proposal, considering both the exposed facets of support and the interaction with gas, is presented to alter the property of the support to tune SMSI. With this strategy, the same support can vary its property to reducible, oxidative, or other complex properties.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supported metal catalysts are important in many industrial reactions. It is reported that support materials are not always inert, and in some cases could even interact with metal nanoparticles (NPs) actively via various ways. In particular, the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI), referring to metal NPs covered by support materials, affects catalysis at the active sites on the metal NP surface, which can serve as a very effective method in tuning and improving catalytic performance. By tailoring the support materials or controlling the treatment processes, different kinds of SMSI, such as classical SMSI, oxidative SMSI, wet-chemistry SMSI, and adsorbate-mediated SMSI, can be achieved. This concept summarizes the general strategies to tune SMSI and discusses the key results. Moreover, a new proposal is presented to tailor SMSI by combining both the exposed facets of the support materials and external environments. Furthermore, the challenges faced at present are discussed and useful insights for future research concerning this topic are provided.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrathin Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanosheets Based on a Halogen&#8208;Substituted Porphyrin Ligand: Synthesis and Catalytic Application in CO2 Reductive Amination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of ultrathin porphyrinic metal&#8211;organic framework (X&#8208;PMOF, X=F, Cl, Br) nanosheets with a thickness of down to 4.5&#8197;nm was prepared from the self&#8208;assembly of unsymmetrical halogen&#8208;based porphyrin ligands and ZrCl4. With the introduction of iridium(III) atoms into the porphyrin rings, the resultant Br&#8208;PMOF(Ir) nanosheets were efficient for CO2 reduction and aminolysis, giving rise to formamides in high yields under room temperature and atmospheric pressure.







Abstract
Ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheets have emerged as a promising kind of heterogeneous catalysts. Herein, we report a series of 2D porphyrinic metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheets (X&#8208;PMOF, X=F, Cl, Br), which was prepared from the self&#8208;assembly of a halogen&#8208;based porphyrin ligand X&#8208;TCPP (X&#8208;TCPP=5&#8208;(4&#8208;halogenatedphenyl)&#8208;10,15,20&#8208;tris(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)&#8208;porphyrin) and ZrCl4 in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid as the modulating reagent. The framework of X&#8208;PMOF possessed the ftw topology as in MOF&#8208;525. The lamellar X&#8208;PMOF nanosheets with the thickness of down to 4.5&#8197;nm were assembled and aggregated into a flower&#8208;like morphology. With the introduction of iridium(III) atoms into the porphyrin rings, the resultant X&#8208;PMOF(Ir) nanosheets were prepared by a similar method. Catalytic results show that Br&#8208;PMOF(Ir) nanosheets were efficient for CO2 reduction and aminolysis, giving rise to formamides in high yields under room temperature and atmospheric pressure, and can be recycled and reused for 3 runs. The total turnover number of Br&#8208;PMOF(Ir) after 3 runs was 1644 based on Ir. Mechanistic studies disclose that the high efficiency of Br&#8208;PMOF(Ir) nanosheets was ascribed to three factors, including the superior activation capability of iridium(III) porphyrin for Si&#8722;H bonds, more active sites on the external surfaces of Br&#8208;PMOF(Ir) nanosheets, and the defects caused by unsymmetrical porphyrin ligand that increased the framework's affinity towards CO2.

A carp (alkyne) swimming up a waterfall falling from a legendary mountain (energy gap that is hard to jump without photoexcitation) accepts a pearl (alkyl radical) prepared by an oyster (Ir photoredox catalyst) under sunlight irradiation and becomes a dragon with a pearl in its mouth (Markovnikov&#8208;type product) or in its claws (anti&#8208;Markovnikov&#8208;type product) after going through different longmen or dragon gates (different Ni catalysts).

         <title>Triangular Arrangement of Ferromagnetic Iron Chains in the High&#8208;TC Ferromagnet TiFe1&#8722;xOs2+xB2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stacks of alternating (Fe/Os)3 triangles induce ferromagnetic ordering at elevated temperatures in the new transition metal boride TiFe1&#8722;xOs2+xB2. The Curie temperature TC=523(2)&#8197;K and the Weiss constant of 554(3)&#8197;K reflect the strong ferromagnetic exchange interactions within and between the Fe3 triangles as found by DFT calculations.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal borides (TMBs) containing Bn&#8208;fragment (n&gt;3) have recently gained interest for their ability to enable exciting magnetic materials. Herein, we show that the B4&#8208;containing TiFe0.64(1)Os2.36(1)B2 is a new ferromagnetic TMB with a Curie temperature of 523(2)&#8197;K and a Weiss constant of 554(3)&#8197;K, originating from the chain of M3&#8208;triangles (M=64&#8201;%Fe+36&#8201;%Os). The new phase was synthesized from the elements by arc&#8208;melting, and its structure was elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. It belongs to the Ti1+xOs2&#8722;xRuB2&#8208;type structure (space group P
2&#8197;m, no. 189) and contains trigonal&#8208;planar B4 boron fragments [B&#8722;B distance of 1.87(4)&#8197;&#197;] interacting with M3&#8208;triangles [M&#8211;M distances of 2.637(8)&#8197;&#197; and 3.0199(2)&#8197;&#197;]. The experimental results were supported by computational calculations based on the ideal TiFeOs2B2 composition, which revealed strong ferromagnetic interactions within and between the Fe3&#8208;triangles. This discovery represents the first magnetically ordered Os&#8208;rich TMB, thus it will help expand our knowledge of the role of Os in low&#8208;dimensional magnetism of intermetallics and enable the design of such materials in the future.

         <title>Electrochemistry and Reactivity of Chelation&#8208;stabilized Hypervalent Bromine(III) Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite their promising properties, hypervalent bromine(III) reagents remain underexplored due to their low stability and difficult preparation. A fresh approach involves chelation&#8208;stabilized bromine(III) species which are conveniently prepared by electro&#8208;oxidation of parent bromoarenes. The intrinsic Br(III) reactivity can be unlocked in the presence of acids. In this mechanistic study, electrochemical synthesis, redox properties, and chemical reactivity aspects of chelation&#8208;stabilized hypervalent bromine(III) species are disclosed.







Abstract
Hypervalent bromine(III) reagents possess a higher electrophilicity and a stronger oxidizing power compared to their iodine(III) counterparts. Despite the superior reactivity, bromine(III) reagents have a reputation of hard&#8208;to&#8208;control and difficult&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize compounds. This is partly due to their low stability, and partly because their synthesis typically relies on the use of the toxic and highly reactive BrF3 as a precursor. Recently, we proposed chelation&#8208;stabilized hypervalent bromine(III) compounds as a possible solution to both problems. First, they can be conveniently prepared by electro&#8208;oxidation of the corresponding bromoarenes. Second, the chelation endows bromine(III) species with increased stability while retaining sufficient reactivity, comparable to that of iodine(III) counterparts. Finally, their intrinsic reactivity can be unlocked in the presence of acids. Herein, an in&#8208;depth mechanistic study of both the electrochemical generation and the reactivity of the bromine(III) compounds is disclosed, with implications for known applications and future developments in the field.

&lt;p&gt;Hypervalent bromine(III) reagents possess a higher electrophilicity and a stronger oxidizing power compared to their iodine(III) counterparts. Despite the superior reactivity, bromine(III) reagents have a reputation of hard-to-control and difficult-to-synthesize compounds. This is partly due to their low stability, and partly because their synthesis typically relies on the use of the toxic and highly reactive BrF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as a precursor. Recently, we proposed chelation-stabilized hypervalent bromine(III) compounds as a possible solution to both problems. First, they can be conveniently prepared by electro-oxidation of the corresponding bromoarenes. Second, the chelation endows bromine(III) species with increased stability while retaining sufficient reactivity, comparable to that of iodine(III) counterparts. Finally, their intrinsic reactivity can be unlocked in the presence of acids. Herein, an in-depth mechanistic study of both the electrochemical generation and the reactivity of the bromine(III) compounds is disclosed, with implications for known applications and future developments in the field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Relevance of Palladium to Radiopharmaceutical Development Considering Enhanced Coordination Properties of TE1PA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radiopharmaceuticals: Since the macrocyclic gold standards used in nuclear medicine are not suitable to Pd(II) coordination, its radioisotopes remain understated for radiopharmaceutical applications. The monopicolinate cyclam TE1PA presented here is a highly relevant chelator for natural and radioactive Pd, opening avenues to enrich the current palette of radiopharmaceuticals for targeted radiotherapy.







Abstract
The limited use of palladium&#8208;103 and &#8208;109 radionuclides for molecular radiotherapy is surely due to the lack of appropriate ligands capable of fulfilling all criteria required for application in nuclear medicine. Furthermore, the thermodynamic properties of these complexes in solution remain difficult to establish. The challenge is compounded when considering that radiolabeling of compounds for translation to clinical trials requires fast complexation. Thus, the coordination of Pd(II) and 103/109Pd&#8208;nuclides is a huge challenge in terms of molecular design and physicochemical characterization. Herein, we report a comprehensive study highlighting TE1PA, a monopicolinate cyclam &#8211; already established in nuclear imaging with 64Cu&#8208;PET (positron emission tomography) imaging tracers &#8211; as a highly relevant chelator for natural Pd and subsequently 109Pd&#8208;nuclide. The structural, thermodynamic, kinetic and radiolabeling studies of Pd(II) with TE1PA, as well as the comparison of this complex with three structurally related derivatives, support palladium&#8208;TE1PA radiopharmaceuticals as leading candidates for targeted nuclear medicine.

The catalytic enantioselective protonation of &#945;&#8208;oxygenated (2&#8208;azaaryl)methyl anions generated through the formal umpolung addition of the anion of dialkyl phosphites to 2&#8208;azaaryl ketones utilizing the [1,2]&#8208;phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement was demonstrated with chiral bis(guanidino)iminophosphorane organosuperbase. This is a rare example of the catalytic enantioselective protonation of transient carbanions other than enolates, constructing a trisubstituted stereogenic center &#945; to 2&#8208;azaarenes.







Abstract
The formal enantioselective umpolung addition of dialkyl phosphites to 2&#8208;azaaryl ketones was developed under Br&#248;nsted base catalysis. The reaction involves the enantioselective protonation of the transient &#945;&#8208;oxygenated (2&#8208;azaaryl)methyl anion generated through the 1,2&#8208;addition of the anion of dialkyl phosphite to the 2&#8208;azaaryl ketone and the subsequent [1,2]&#8208;phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement. A chiral bis(guanidino)iminophosphorane organosuperbase efficiently catalyzed the reaction to provide enantio&#8208;enriched phosphates in high yields with good to high enantioselectivities. This is a rare example of the catalytic enantioselective protonation of transient carbanions other than enolates, constructing a trisubstituted stereogenic center &#945; to 2&#8208;azaarenes.

         <dc:description>
A last piece of the puzzle? A method that significantly expands the diversity of molecules built in crystals by using principles of supramolecular chemistry is introduced. The approach relies on post&#8208;modification of aryl nitriles, which serve a dual role as hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptors to support intermolecular photodimerization and as organic functional groups that can undergo a variety of chemical transformations (e.&#8201;g., click reactivity).

         <title>An Orthogonal Dynamic Covalent Chemistry Tool for Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Cyclic Oligochalcogenides on Detachable Helical Peptide Templates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 33, June 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recyclable with orthogonal dynamic covalent semicarbazone chemistry, 310 helical peptide templates are introduced as a general chemistry tool to enable and tame unfavorable ring&#8208;opening polymerizations by dynamic covalent disulfide and diselenide exchange cascades.







Abstract
A model system is introduced as a general tool to elaborate on orthogonal templation of dynamic covalent ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ODC&#8208;TROP). The tool consists of 310 helical peptides as unprecedented templates and semicarbazones as orthogonal dynamic covalent linkers. With difficult&#8208;to&#8208;control 1,2&#8208;dithiolanes, ODC&#8208;TROP on the level of short model oligomers occurs with high templation efficiency, increasing and diminishing upon helix stabilization and denaturation, respectively. Further, an anti&#8208;templated conjugate with mispositioned monomers gave reduced templation upon helix twisting. Even with the &#8220;unpolymerizable&#8221; 1,2&#8208;diselenolanes, initial studies already afford mild templation efficiency. These proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle results promise that the here introduced tool, recyclable and enabling late&#8208;stage side chain modification, will be useful to realize ODC&#8208;TROP of intractable or unknown cyclic dynamic covalent monomers for dynamer materials as well as cellular uptake and signaling applications.

These proof-of-principle results promise that the here introduced tool, recyclable and enabling late-stage side chain modification, will be useful to realize ODC-TROP of intractable or unknown cyclic dynamic covalent monomers for dynamer materials as well as cellular uptake and signaling applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Development of a Fully Continuous&#8208;Flow Approach Towards Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Tetrahydroprotoberberine Natural Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 33, June 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully continuous flow approach towards asymmetric total synthesis of four natural tetrahydroprotoberberine alkaloids, was developed through a concise linear sequence involving four chemical transformations and three on&#8208;line work&#8208;up processes without any intermediate purification. The overall yields and enantioselectivities obtained in this novel integrated flow platform were up to 50&#8201;% and 92&#8201;%ee, respectively, in a total residence time of 32.5&#8197;min.







Abstract
Continuous flow synthetic technologies had been widely applied in the total synthesis in the past few decades. Fully continuous flow synthesis is still extremely focused on multi&#8208;step synthesis of complex natural pharmaceutical molecules. Thus, the development of fully continuous flow total synthesis of natural products is in demand but challenging. Herein, we demonstrated the first fully continuous flow approach towards asymmetric total synthesis of natural tetrahydroprotoberberine alkaloids, (&#8722;)&#8208;isocanadine, (&#8722;)&#8208;tetrahydropseudocoptisine, (&#8722;)&#8208;stylopine and (&#8722;)&#8208;nandinine. This method features a concise linear sequence involving four chemical transformations and three on&#8208;line work&#8208;up processing in an integrated flow platform, without any intermediate purification. The overall yield and enantioselectivity of this four&#8208;step continuous flow chemistry were up to 50&#8201;% and 92&#8201;%ee, respectively, in a total residence time of 32.5&#8197;min, corresponding to a throughput of 145&#8197;mg/h.

Radical hydrazinium: A highly labile hydrazinium&#8208;yl radical cation, [(Me3Si)2N&#8722;N(H)SiMe3]&#729;+, formed by a one&#8208;electron oxidation of tris(trimethylsilyl) hydrazine, (Me3Si)2N&#8722;N(H)SiMe3, with silver salts is presented. The structural and electronic parameters of the hydrazinium&#8208;yl radical cation were elucidated, revealing that the spin density in the isolated radical is mainly localized along the N&#8722;N unit of the hydrazine moiety.







Abstract
The oxidation of silylated hydrazine, (Me3Si)2N&#8722;N(H)SiMe3, with silver salts led to the formation of a highly labile hydrazinium&#8208;yl radical cation, [(Me3Si)2N&#8722;N(H)SiMe3].+, at very low temperatures (decomposition &gt; &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C). EPR, NMR, DFT and Raman studies revealed the formation of a nitrogen&#8208;centered radical cation along the N&#8722;N unit of the hydrazine. In the presence of the weakly coordinating anion [Al{OCH(CF3)2}4]&#8722;, crystallization and structural characterization in the solid state were achieved. The hydrazinium&#8208;yl radical cation has a significantly shortened N&#8722;N bond and a nearly planar N2Si3 framework, in contrast to the starting material. According to DFT calculations, the shortened N&#8722;N bond has a total bond order of 1.5 with a &#960;&#8208;bond order of 0.5. The &#960; bond can be regarded as a three&#8208;&#960;&#8208;electron, two&#8208;center bond.

         <title>Reliable Functionalization of 5,6&#8208;Fused Bicyclic N&#8208;Heterocycles Pyrazolopyrimidines and Imidazopyridazines via Zinc and Magnesium Organometallics</title>

N&#8208;heterocycles, pyrazolopyrimidines and imidazopyridazines were reliably functionalized with the support of DFT &#8208; calculations using Grignard reagents as nucleophilic partners and TMPZn&#8208;mediated zincations for 5&#8208;chloropyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidine. Successive regioselective magnesiations with TMPMgCl&#8901;LiCl or TMP2Zn&#8901;MgCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2&#8201;LiCl in the presence or absence of BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2 for the 6&#8208;chloroimidazo[1,2&#8208;b]pyridazine scaffold provided a range of highly functionalized new N&#8208;heterocycles of pharmaceutical interest.







Abstract
DFT&#8208;calculations allow prediction of the reactivity of uncommon N&#8208;heterocyclic scaffolds of pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidines and imidazo[1,2&#8208;b]pyridazines and considerably facilitate their functionalization. The derivatization of these N&#8208;heterocycles was realized using Grignard reagents for nucleophilic additions to 5&#8208;chloropyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidines and TMP2Zn&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2&#8201;MgCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2&#8201;LiCl allowed regioselective zincations. In the case of 6&#8208;chloroimidazo[1,2&#8208;b]pyridazine, bases such as TMP2Zn&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;MgCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2&#8201;LiCl, in the presence or absence of BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2, led to regioselective metalations at positions 3 or 8. Subsequent functionalizations were achieved with TMPMgCl&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;LiCl, producing various polysubstituted derivatives (up to penta&#8208;substitution). X&#8208;ray analysis confirmed the regioselectivity for key functional heterocycles.

         <title>Renaissance of Topotactic Ion&#8208;Exchange for Functional Solids with Close Packed Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 33, June 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topotactic cation exchange on close&#8208;packed structures has recently emerged as a potent synthetic tactic for the preparation of many new functional solids. A synergistic blending of new functionality to an underlying three&#8208;dimensional structure can be achieved that, in many cases, yields a unique pathway to metastable solids with new and/or enhanced properties, such as for visible&#8208;light photocatalysts. For example, shown is the new semiconductor photocatalyst SZT (SnZr1/2Ti1/2O3) as a nano&#8208;shell on BZT (BaZr1/2Ti1/2O3).







Abstract
Recently, many new, complex, functional oxides have been discovered with the surprising use of topotactic ion&#8208;exchange reactions on close&#8208;packed structures, such as found for wurtzite, rutile, perovskite, and other structure types. Despite a lack of apparent cation&#8208;diffusion pathways in these structure types, synthetic low&#8208;temperature transformations are possible with the interdiffusion and exchange of functional cations possessing ns2 stereoactive lone pairs (e.&#8201;g., Sn(II)) or unpaired ndx electrons (e.&#8201;g., Co(II)), targeting new and favorable modulations of their electronic, magnetic, or catalytic properties. This enables a synergistic blending of new functionality to an underlying three&#8208;dimensional connectivity, i.&#8201;e., [&#8208;M&#8722;O&#8208;M&#8208;O&#8208;]n, that is maintained during the transformation.

     alt="Renaissance of Topotactic Ion-Exchange for Functional Solids with Close Packed Structures"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Topotactic cation exchange&lt;/b&gt; on close-packed structures has recently emerged as a potent synthetic tactic for the preparation of many new functional solids. A synergistic blending of new functionality to an underlying three-dimensional structure can be achieved that, in many cases, yields a unique pathway to metastable solids with new and/or enhanced properties, such as for visible-light photocatalysts. For example, shown is the new semiconductor photocatalyst SZT (SnZr&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) as a nano-shell on BZT (BaZr&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, many new, complex, functional oxides have been discovered with the surprising use of topotactic ion-exchange reactions on close-packed structures, such as found for wurtzite, rutile, perovskite, and other structure types. Despite a lack of apparent cation-diffusion pathways in these structure types, synthetic low-temperature transformations are possible with the interdiffusion and exchange of functional cations possessing n&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; stereoactive lone pairs (e.&#8201;g., Sn(II)) or unpaired n&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; electrons (e.&#8201;g., Co(II)), targeting new and favorable modulations of their electronic, magnetic, or catalytic properties. This enables a synergistic blending of new functionality to an underlying three-dimensional connectivity, i.&#8201;e., [-M&#8722;O-M-O-]&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;, that is maintained during the transformation. In many cases, this tactic represents the only known pathway to prepare thermodynamically unstable solids that otherwise would commonly decompose by phase segregation, such as that recently applied to the discovery of many new small bandgap semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Remote Effect from Boron Cluster: Tunable Photophysical Properties of o&#8208;Carborane&#8208;Based Luminogens</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 33, June 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new molecular design strategy that attaches the o&#8208;carborane group to the remote side of luminogens was proposed. The remote effect from the o&#8208;carboranyl unit on the end of luminogens could significantly modulate the photophysical properties in both solution and the solid state. The carborane&#8208;substituted luminogens show lower luminescence efficiency in solution and longer emission wavelength in the solid state in contrast to those of model compounds.







Abstract
We proposed a new molecular design strategy that the o&#8208;carboranyl group is attached as &#8220;an innocent unit&#8221; to the remote side of luminogens to tune photophysical properties. To verify this strategy, two o&#8208;carborane&#8208;based compounds with asymmetric molecular geometry were designed and synthesized. Photophysical properties of o&#8208;carborane&#8208;based luminogens were investigated on the basis of UV&#8208;Vis spectra, photoluminescence spectra, crystal structure analysis and theoretical calculations. The results indicate that the o&#8208;carboranyl group has a slight effect on the energy gap between the ground state (S0) and the first excited state (S1) in the solution state but a significant effect on the energy gap between S0 and S1 in the solid state. Besides, the radiative and non&#8208;radiative transition processes are modulated by the o&#8208;carboranyl unit. This leads to emission quenching in the solution state but an enhanced luminous efficiency in the aggregate state with a typical aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) property.

         <title>Four&#8208;Component Ugi Reaction for Optical Chirality Sensing and Surface Nanoengineering of Chiral Self&#8208;Assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 33, June 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The four&#8208;component Ugi reaction was successfully utilized in the optical ee% sensing of chiral amines. An intramolecular folded structure was employed to boost the CD signal. Optical sensing of amines was applicable in a general and precise manner to a variety of substrates, from synthetic to natural amines. In aqueous media, conjugation of amine&#8208;bearing dyes enables fluorescent visualization yet without changing the pristine morphology, providing a promising strategy for surface engineering of soft assemblies.







Abstract
Using green chemistry to control chirality at hierarchical levels as well as chiroptical activities endows with new opportunities to the development of multiple functions. Here, the four&#8208;component Ugi reaction is introduced for the general and precise optical chirality sensing of amines as well as the surface nanoengineering of chiral soft self&#8208;assemblies. To overcome the relatively weak Cotton effects, direct synthesis of a folded peptide structure on a rotatable ferrocene core with axial chirality was accomplished from chiral amine, 1,1&#8217;&#8208;ferrocenyl dicarboxylic acid, formaldehyde and isocyanide. Enhanced Cotton effects benefiting from the folded structure allow for the precise and quantitative sensing of natural and synthetic chiral amines covering alkyl, aromatic amines and amino acid derivatives. In addition, aqueous reaction enables the modification of amine&#8208;bearing dye to microfibers self&#8208;assembled from &#960;&#8208;conjugated amino acids. Surface dye&#8208;modification via Ugi reaction barely changes the pristine morphology, showing non&#8208;invasive properties in contrast to dye staining, which is applicable in soft nano/microarchitectures from self&#8208;assembly. This work which combines the four&#8208;component Ugi reaction to enable precise ee% detection and surface nanoengineering of soft chiral assemblies sheds light on the advanced application of green chemistry to chirality science.

         <title>Efficient Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting from a Discrete Hybrid Bismuth Bromide Ferroelectric Templated by Phosphonium Cation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 33, June 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphonium perovskitoid harvesters: A hybrid bismuth halide salt, [Me(Ph)3P]3[Bi2Br9], stabilized by phosphonium cations was synthesized and shown to exhibit ferroelectric polarization as determined by P&#8722;E loop and piezoresponse force microscopy measurements. Flexible composite devices of it with polydimethylsiloxane were fabricated and utilized as piezoelectric nanogenerators with high output voltage and power density values. The obtained voltages were further employed for capacitor charging applications.







Abstract
Bismuth containing hybrid molecular ferroelectrics are receiving tremendous attention in recent years owing to their stable and non&#8208;toxic composition. However, these perovskite&#8208;like structures are primarily limited to ammonium cations. Herein, we report a new phosphonium based discrete perovskite&#8208;like hybrid ferroelectric with a formula [Me(Ph)3P]3[Bi2Br9] (MTPBB) and its mechanical energy harvesting capability. The Polarization&#8208;Electric field (P&#8208;E) measurements resulted in a well&#8208;defined ferroelectric hysteresis loop with a remnant polarization value of 2.1&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Piezoresponse force microscopy experiments enabled visualization of the ferroelectric domain structure and evaluation of the piezoelectric strain coefficient (d33) for an MTPBB single crystal and thin film sample. Furthermore, flexible devices incorporating MTPBB in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix at various concentrations were fabricated and explored for their mechanical energy harvesting properties. The champion device with 20&#8197;wt&#8201;% of MTPBB in PDMS rendered a maximum peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak open&#8208;circuit voltage of 22.9&#8197;V and a maximum power density of 7&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at an optimal load of 4&#8197;M&#937;. Moreover, the potential of MTPBB&#8208;based devices in low power electronics was demonstrated by storing the harvested energy in various electrolytic capacitors.

         <title>Cation&#8208;&#960; Interactions between a Noble Metal and a Polyfunctional Aromatic Ligand: Ag+(benzylamine)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 33, June 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
IR multiple photon dissociation spectroscopy unveils the structure of the Ag+(benzylamine) complex (Ag+(BA)), presenting a N&#8208;Ag+&#8208;&#960; chelate coordination involving both the amino nitrogen and the phenyl &#960;&#8208;system. The gas&#8208;phase reactivity of Ag+(BA) with neutral molecular ligands (L) confirms N&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;binding affinity and indicates an augmented silver coordination in the Ag+(BA)(L) adduct.







Abstract
The structure of an isolated Ag+(benzylamine) complex is investigated by infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy complemented with quantum chemical calculations of candidate geometries and their vibrational spectra, aiming to ascertain the role of competing cation&#8208;N and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions potentially offered by the polyfunctional ligand. The IRMPD spectrum has been recorded in the 800&#8211;1800&#8197;cm&#8722;1 fingerprint range using the IR free electron laser beamline coupled with an FT&#8208;ICR mass spectrometer at the Centre Laser Infrarouge d'Orsay (CLIO). The resulting IRMPD pattern points toward a chelate coordination (N&#8208;Ag+&#8208;&#960;) involving both the amino nitrogen atom and the aromatic &#960;&#8208;system of the phenyl ring. The gas&#8208;phase reactivity of Ag+(benzylamine) with a neutral molecular ligand (L) possessing either an amino/aza functionality or an aryl group confirms N&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;binding affinity and suggests an augmented silver coordination in the product adduct ion

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;IR multiple photon&lt;/b&gt; dissociation spectroscopy unveils the structure of the Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(benzylamine) complex (Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(BA)), presenting a N-Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-&#960; chelate coordination involving both the amino nitrogen and the phenyl &#960;-system. The gas-phase reactivity of Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(BA) with neutral molecular ligands (L) confirms N- and &#960;-binding affinity and indicates an augmented silver coordination in the Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(BA)(L) adduct.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structure of an isolated Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(benzylamine) complex is investigated by infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy complemented with quantum chemical calculations of candidate geometries and their vibrational spectra, aiming to ascertain the role of competing cation-N and cation-&#960; interactions potentially offered by the polyfunctional ligand. The IRMPD spectrum has been recorded in the 800&#8211;1800&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; fingerprint range using the IR free electron laser beamline coupled with an FT-ICR mass spectrometer at the Centre Laser Infrarouge d'Orsay (CLIO). The resulting IRMPD pattern points toward a chelate coordination (N-Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-&#960;) involving both the amino nitrogen atom and the aromatic &#960;-system of the phenyl ring. The gas-phase reactivity of Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(benzylamine) with a neutral molecular ligand (L) possessing either an amino/aza functionality or an aryl group confirms N- and &#960;-binding affinity and suggests an augmented silver coordination in the product adduct ion

The chiral cationic diphosphine ruthenium(II) complexes [RuX(CO)(PP)(phen)]Y (X, Y=carboxylates, thioacetate, PP=(R,R)&#8208; or (S,S)&#8208;Skewphos), isolated as single stereoisomers, inhibit cancer cell proliferation and colonization with EC50 values ranging from 2.8 to 0.04&#8197;&#956;M, the (R,R)&#8208;enantiomers being up to 14 times more active than the (S,S) ones. In water, the (S)&#8208;cysteine and GSH adducts are easily formed from the carboxylate derivatives via aquo complexes.







Abstract
The chiral cationic complex [Ru(&#951;1&#8208;OAc)(CO)((R,R)&#8208;Skewphos)(phen)]OAc (2R), isolated from reaction of [Ru(&#951;1&#8208;OAc)(&#951;2&#8208;OAc)(R,R)&#8208;Skewphos)(CO)] (1R) with phen, reacts with NaOPiv and KSAc affording [RuX(CO)((R,R)&#8208;Skewphos)(phen)]Y (X=Y=OPiv 3R; X=SAc, Y=OAc 4R). The corresponding enantiomers 2S&#8208;4S have been obtained from 1S containing (S,S)&#8208;Skewphos. Reaction of 2R and 2S with (S)&#8208;cysteine and NaPF6 at pH=9 gives the diastereoisomers [Ru((S)&#8208;Cys)(CO)(PP)(phen)]PF6 (PP=(R,R)&#8208;Skewphos 2R&#8208;Cys; (S,S)&#8208;Skewphos 2S&#8208;Cys). The DFT energetic profile for 2R with (S)&#8208;cysteine in H2O indicates that aquo and hydroxo species are involved in formation of 2R&#8208;Cys. The stability of the ruthenium complexes in 0.9&#8201;% w/v NaCl solution, PBS and complete DMEM medium, as well as their n&#8208;octanol/water partition coefficient (logP), have been evaluated. The chiral complexes show high cytotoxic activity against SW1736, 8505&#8197;C, HCT&#8208;116 and A549&#8197;cell lines with EC50 values of 2.8&#8211;0.04&#8197;&#956;M. The (R,R)&#8208;Skewphos derivatives show higher cytotoxicity compared to their enantiomers, 4R (EC50=0.04&#8197;&#956;M) being 14 times more cytotoxic than 4S against the anaplastic thyroid cancer 8505&#8197;C cell line.

         <title>Size Effects of the Anions in the Ionothermal Synthesis of Carbon Nitride Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 33, June 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Size effects: Ionothermal condensation of dicyandiamide in alkali halide salt melts leads to the formation of extended 2D, layered frameworks only in the presence of small halides such as chloride, and bromide. With increasing size of the alkali halide intercalate, stabilizing van der Waals interactions between extended, &#960;&#8208;conjugated triazine&#8208;based sheets are lost. The main, crystalline product from an alkali iodide eutectic was identified as melem hydrate, a heptazine (C6N7)&#8208;based, hydrogen&#8208;bonded, monoclinic solid.







Abstract
Semiconducting carbon nitride polymers are used in metal&#8208;free photocatalysts and in opto&#8208;electronic devices. Conventionally, they are obtained using thermal and ionothermal syntheses in inscrutable, closed systems and therefore, their condensation behavior is poorly understood. Here, the synthetic protocols and properties are compared for two types of carbon nitride materials &#8211; 2D layered poly(triazine imide) (PTI) and hydrogen&#8208;bonded melem hydrate &#8211; obtained from three low&#8208;melting salt eutectics taken from the systematic series of the alkali metal halides: LiCl/KCl, LiBr/KBr, and LiI/KI. The size of the anion plays a significant role in the formation process of the condensed carbon nitride polymers, and it suggests a strong templating effect. The smaller anions (chloride and bromide) become incorporated into triazine (C3N3)&#8208;based PTI frameworks. The larger iodide does not stabilize the formation of a triazine&#8208;based polymer, but instead it leads to the formation of the heptazine (C6N7)&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded melem hydrate as the main crystalline phase. Melem hydrate, obtained as single&#8208;crystalline powders, was compared with PTI in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water and in an OLED device. Further, the emergence of each carbon nitride species from its corresponding salt eutectic was rationalized via density functional theory calculations. This study highlights the possibilities to further tailor the properties of eutectic salt melts for ionothermal synthesis of organic functional materials.

         <title>Direct In Situ Vertical Growth of Interlaced Mesoporous NiO Nanosheets on Carbon Felt for Electrocatalytic Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 33, June 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel interlaced mesoporous NiO NSs@CF electrochemical catalyst was prepared using a direct in&#8197;situ vertical growth method, in which NiO formed mesoporous nanosheets with a pore size of 15&#8197;nm and a thickness of &#8764;30&#8197;nm. This binder&#8208;free electrode exhibited a superior NH3 yield of 71.3&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8197;mg&#8722;1cat. and a FE of 17.9&#8201;% at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. RHE.







Abstract
Metal oxide nanomaterials directly grown on conductive substrates are optimal electrode materials because their structures allow for rapid ion and electron transport and thereby reduce internal resistance in the electrode. The development of such binder&#8208;free, self&#8208;supporting electrodes is of great significance for applications in electrocatalysis. In this work, a simple hydrothermal in&#8197;situ self&#8208;assembly reaction and annealing process was developed to prepare three kinds of nickel oxide @ carbon felt (NiO@CF) nanocomposites with different morphologies. The influence of different precipitators (strong or weak bases) on the morphology of the resulting nano&#8208;sized nickel oxide nanocomposites was investigated. The microstructures of the NiO@CF samples were characterized with field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). When ammonia was used as the precipitator, NiO grew vertically on the surface of the carbon felt and formed a mesoporous nanosheet&#8208;like structure (NiO NSs@CF).

The good performance was attributed to the vertical interleaved mesoporous sheet&#8208;like structure (with the pore size of 15&#8197;nm and the thickness of &#8764;30&#8197;nm) and the relatively high concentration of oxygen vacancies. First&#8208;principles calculations with strong on&#8208;site Coulomb interactions demonstrated that the presence of oxygen vacancy on NiO sample leads to a significantly stronger N binding over the surface, benefiting for the nitrogen gas adsorption and reduction. The e&#8208;NRR performance of this binder&#8208;free, flexible electrode material is superior to that of other reported nickel&#8208;based nanomaterials. This study highlights the potential of such binder&#8208;free carbon felt electrodes for use in e&#8208;NRR that could meet the needs of industrial production.

     alt="Direct In Situ Vertical Growth of Interlaced Mesoporous NiO Nanosheets on Carbon Felt for Electrocatalytic Ammonia Synthesis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A novel interlaced&lt;/b&gt; mesoporous NiO NSs@CF electrochemical catalyst was prepared using a direct in&#8197;situ vertical growth method, in which NiO formed mesoporous nanosheets with a pore size of 15&#8197;nm and a thickness of &#8764;30&#8197;nm. This binder-free electrode exhibited a superior NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield of 71.3&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;cat. and a FE of 17.9&#8201;% at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. RHE.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal oxide nanomaterials directly grown on conductive substrates are optimal electrode materials because their structures allow for rapid ion and electron transport and thereby reduce internal resistance in the electrode. The development of such binder-free, self-supporting electrodes is of great significance for applications in electrocatalysis. In this work, a simple hydrothermal in&#8197;situ self-assembly reaction and annealing process was developed to prepare three kinds of nickel oxide @ carbon felt (NiO@CF) nanocomposites with different morphologies. The influence of different precipitators (strong or weak bases) on the morphology of the resulting nano-sized nickel oxide nanocomposites was investigated. The microstructures of the NiO@CF samples were characterized with field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). When ammonia was used as the precipitator, NiO grew vertically on the surface of the carbon felt and formed a mesoporous nanosheet-like structure (NiO NSs@CF). As an electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;-NRR) electrode, the NiO NSs@CF sample showed an excellent NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield (71.3&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;cat.&lt;/sub&gt;) and Faradaic efficiency (17.9&#8201;% at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. RHE) in 0.1&#8197;M Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The good performance was attributed to the vertical interleaved mesoporous sheet-like structure (with the pore size of 15&#8197;nm and the thickness of &#8764;30&#8197;nm) and the relatively high concentration of oxygen vacancies. First-principles calculations with strong on-site Coulomb interactions demonstrated that the presence of oxygen vacancy on NiO sample leads to a significantly stronger N binding over the surface, benefiting for the nitrogen gas adsorption and reduction. The &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;-NRR performance of this binder-free, flexible electrode material is superior to that of other reported nickel-based nanomaterials. This study highlights the potential of such binder-free carbon felt electrodes for use in &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;-NRR that could meet the needs of industrial production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Spiro[cyclobutene&#8208;1,9&#8242;&#8208;fluorene] framework is effectively constructed from easily available biaryl&#8208;alkynes through a two&#8208;step protocol including selective (2+2) cycloaddition with in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated Tf2C=CH2 and HFIP&#8208;promoted desulfinative spirocyclisation.







Abstract
A two&#8208;step synthesis of less accessible spiro[cyclobutene&#8208;1,9&#8242;&#8208;fluorene] compounds from biaryl&#8208;alkynes and 2&#8208;(2&#8208;fluoropyridin&#8208;1&#8208;ium&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,1&#8208;bis((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;ide, which serves as a potent precursor for outstandingly electrophilic Tf2C=CH2, has been developed. This synthetic methodology includes selective formation of gem&#8208;bis(triflyl)cyclobutenes from biaryl&#8208;alkynes and Tf2C=CH2 followed by desulfinative spirocyclisation mediated by 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol (HFIP). Besides, on the basis of the chameleonic reactivity of sulfone functionality, several derivatisations of triflylated spiro[cyclobutene&#8208;1,9&#8242;&#8208;fluorene] products have been successfully achieved.

         <title>Reactivity of Xantphos&#8208;Type Rhodium Complexes Towards SF4: SF3 Versus SF2 Complex Generation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 33, June 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
S&#8722;F bond activation: Treatment of the xantphos&#8208;type rhodium complex [Rh(Me)(tBuxanPOP)] with SF4 gave the &#955;4&#8208;trifluorosulfanyl complex [Rh(Me)(SF3)(tBuxanPOP)][SF5]. Its molecular structure in the solid state reveals a Rh&#8722;F interaction of the SF3 ligand with the metal center. Further reactions with Lewis acids and chlorine sources have been investigated.







Abstract
S&#8722;F&#8208;bond activation of sulfur tetrafluoride at [Rh(Cl)(tBuxanPOP)] (1; tBuxanPOP=9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;bis&#8208;(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphino)&#8208;xanthene) led to the formation of the cationic complex [Rh(F)(Cl)(SF2)(tBuxanPOP)][SF5] (2&#8201;a) together with trans&#8208;[Rh(Cl)(F)2(tBuxanPOP)] (3) and cis&#8208;[Rh(Cl)2(F)(tBuxanPOP)] (4) which both could also be obtained by the reaction of SF5Cl with 1. In contrast to that, the conversion of SF4 at the methyl complex [Rh(Me)(tBuxanPOP)] (5) gave the isolable and room&#8208;temperature stable cationic &#955;4&#8208;trifluorosulfanyl complex [Rh(Me)(SF3)(tBuxanPOP)][SF5] (6). Treatment of 6 with the Lewis acids BF3 or AsF5 produced the dicationic difluorosulfanyl complex [Rh(Me)(SF2)(tBuxanPOP)][BF4]2 (8&#8201;a) or [Rh(Me)(SF2)(tBuxanPOP)][AsF6]2 (8&#8201;b), respectively. Refluorination of 8&#8201;a was possible with the use of dimethylamine giving [Rh(Me)(SF3)(tBuxanPOP)][BF4] (9). A reaction of 6 with trichloroisocyanuric acid (TClCA) gave the fluorido complex [Rh(F)(Cl)(SF2)(tBuxanPOP)][Cl] (2&#8201;b) together with chloromethane and SF5Cl.

         <title>Enantioselective Organophotocatalytic Telescoped Synthesis of a Chiral Privileged Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 33, June 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient in&#8208;flow catalytic enantioselective organophotoredox alkylation of aldehydes has been successfully developed (up to 98&#8201;% e.e.) and applied to the fully telescoped synthesis of a chiral active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), consisting of four units of operation: in&#8208;flow asymmetric benzylation, inline continuous work&#8208;up, neutralisation and oxidative amidation. By using flow technologies, the productivity was increased by almost 200 times compared to the batch reaction.







Abstract
The continuous flow, enantioselective, organophotoredox catalytic asymmetric alkylation of aldehydes was studied, by using a homemade, custom&#8208;designed photoreactor for reactions under cryogenic conditions. Going from microfluidic conditions up to a 10&#8197;mL mesofluidic reactor, an increase of productivity by almost 18000&#8201;% compared to the batch reaction was demonstrated. Finally, for the first time, a stereoselective photoredox organocatalytic continuous flow reaction in a fully telescoped process for an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API)synthesis was successfully achieved. The final process consists of four units of operation: visible light&#8208;driven asymmetric catalytic benzylation under continuous flow, inline continuous work&#8208;up, neutralisation and a final oxidative amidation step afforded the pharmaceutically active molecule in 95&#8201;% e.e.

         <title>The Unexpected Helical Supramolecular Assembly of a Simple Achiral Acetamide Tecton Generates Selective Water Channels</title>

Water wire transfer: A simple achiral hydrated acetamide self&#8208;organizes into a chiral channel with highly mobile water molecules. The crystalline architecture displays breathing behavior near room temperature with fully reversible release and re&#8208;uptake of water molecules. The water transport is very efficient compared to that with previously reported artificial water channels and has a very good selectivity against NaCl; it could therefore be an efficient candidate for desalination processes.







Abstract
Achiral 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;N&#8208;(diphenylmethyl)acetamide (HNDPA) crystallizes in the P61 chiral space group as a hydrate, building up permeable chiral crystalline helical water channels. The crystallization&#8208;driven chiral self&#8208;resolution process is highly robust, with the same air&#8208;stable crystalline form readily obtained under a variety of conditions. Interestingly, the HNDPA supramolecular helix inner pore is filled by a helical water wire. The whole edifice is mainly stabilized by robust hydrogen bonds involving the HNDPA amide bonds and CH&#8230;&#960; interactions between the HNDPA phenyl groups. The crystalline structure shows breathing behavior, with completely reversible release and re&#8208;uptake of water inside the chiral channel under ambient conditions. Importantly, the HNDPA channel is able to transport water very efficiently and selectively under biomimetic conditions. With a permeability per channel of 3.3 million water molecules per second in large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) and total selectivity against NaCl, the HNDPA channel is a very promising functional nanomaterial for future applications.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Water wire transfer&lt;/b&gt;: A simple achiral hydrated acetamide self-organizes into a chiral channel with highly mobile water molecules. The crystalline architecture displays breathing behavior near room temperature with fully reversible release and re-uptake of water molecules. The water transport is very efficient compared to that with previously reported artificial water channels and has a very good selectivity against NaCl; it could therefore be an efficient candidate for desalination processes.

&lt;p&gt;Achiral 2-hydroxy-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-(diphenylmethyl)acetamide (HNDPA) crystallizes in the &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;6&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; chiral space group as a hydrate, building up permeable chiral crystalline helical water channels. The crystallization-driven chiral self-resolution process is highly robust, with the same air-stable crystalline form readily obtained under a variety of conditions. Interestingly, the HNDPA supramolecular helix inner pore is filled by a helical water wire. The whole edifice is mainly stabilized by robust hydrogen bonds involving the HNDPA amide bonds and CH&lt;sup&gt;&#8230;&lt;/sup&gt;&#960; interactions between the HNDPA phenyl groups. The crystalline structure shows breathing behavior, with completely reversible release and re-uptake of water inside the chiral channel under ambient conditions.

Chiral channels with highly mobile water molecules result from the robust self&#8208;organization of a simple achiral acetamide. Fully reversible release and re&#8208;uptake of water molecules takes place near ambient conditions, with efficient water transport and a good selectivity against NaCl suggesting it to be an efficient candidate for desalination processes. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. van&#8197;der&#8197;Lee and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200383).

An effective two&#8208;step synthesis for spiro[cyclobutene&#8208;1,9&#8242;&#8208;fluorene] has been developed that allows the arrangement of substituents on three mutually orthogonal axes (triaxes), represented as the right/left hand of Fleming's rules. This unique molecular scaffold leads to new designs of functional small molecules and macromolecules. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Hoshikawa, H. Yanai and T.

         <dc:description>
Synthetic transformations of close&#8208;packed structures have witnessed a budding renaissance with the use of topotactic ion&#8208;exchange reactions. Surprising pathways to many new multifunctional and metastable solids have been discovered by leveraging the ion mobilities within their underlying sublattices. Recent research has begun elucidating many of the key synthetic variables, such as highlighted in the article frontispiece.

         <title>Conversion of CH4 Catalyzed by Gas Phase Ions Containing Metals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 33, June 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review article discusses the significant progress that has been made for catalytic methane conversion in the gas phase, with focus on the coupling reactions of CH4 molecules and of CH4 with other substrates (O2, O3, N2O, CO2, and H2O) catalyzed by ions containing metals. The mechanistic details for generation of C&#8722;C coupling and C&#8208;O coupling products from methane have been provided at a strictly molecular level.







Abstract
Methane is an abundant and cheap feedstock to produce valuable chemicals. The catalytic reaction of methane conversion generally requires the participation of multiple molecules (such as two or three CH4 molecules, O2, CO2, etc.). Such complex process includes the cleavage of original chemical bonds, formation of new chemical bonds, and desorption of products. The gas phase study provides a unique arena to gain molecular&#8208;level insights into the detailed mechanisms of bond&#8208;breaking and bond&#8208;forming involved in complicated catalytic reactions. In this Review, we introduce the methane conversion catalyzed by gas phase ions containing metals and three topics will be discussed: (1) the direct coupling of methane molecules, (2) the conversion of CH4 with O2, O3 and N2O, and (3) the conversion of CH4 with CO2 and H2O. The obtained mechanistic aspects may provide new clues for rational design of better&#8208;performing catalysts for conversion of methane to value&#8208;added products.

         <title>The Unexpected Helical Supramolecular Assembly of a Simple Achiral Acetamide Tecton Generates Selective Water Channels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 33, June 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Hydrated HNDPA is a highly robust example of chiral symmetry breaking, which is an extremely rare phenomenon.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202200383).







Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue is the collaborative research team coordinated by Arie van&#8197;der&#8197;Lee at the University of Montpellier. The image depicts chiral channels with highly mobile water molecules resulting from the robust self&#8208;organization of a simple achiral acetamide. Fully reversible release and re&#8208;uptake of water molecules takes place near ambient conditions, with efficient water transport and a good selectivity against NaCl suggesting it to be an efficient candidate for desalination processes.

         <title>Fluorescent P&#8208;hydroxyphosphole for peptide labeling through P&#8208;N bond formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of fluorescent P&#8208;hydroxybinaphtylphosphole&#8208;oxide or &#8208;sulfide was achieved by trapping a binaphtyl dianion with methyl dichlorophosphite or P&#8208;(N,N&#8208;diethylamino)dichlorophosphine, followed by oxidation or sulfuration of the P&#8208;center. After saponification or acid hydrolysis, the P&#8208;hydroxyphospholes were coupled to peptides using the coupling agent BOP, under the conditions required for the synthesis in solution or on a solid support. This new method was illustrated by the labeling of the JMV2959, a potent antagonist of the Growth Hormone Secretagogue Receptor type 1a (GHS&#8208;R1a). The labeled conjugates were used to characterize GHSR ligands by competition assays, based on Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). Such P&#8208;hydroxyphosphole&#8208;oxide or &#8208;sulfide constitutes a promising new class of compact fluorophores with large Stokes shift, for labeling biomolecules by grafting through the phosphorus atom.</dc:description>

         <title>Different Enzyme Conformations Induce Different Mechanistic Traits on HIV&#8208;1 Protease</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The influence of the dynamical flexibility of enzymes in reaction mechanisms is a cornerstone in biological sciences. In this study we aim to: (1) study the convergence of the activation free energy, using the first step of the reaction catalysed by HIV&#8208;1 protease as a case study; and (2) provide further evidence for a mechanistic divergence in this enzyme, as two different reaction pathways were observed to contribute to this step. Here we used quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics molecular dynamics simulations, on four different initial conformations, which led to different barriers in a previous study. Despite the sampling, the four activation free energies still spanned a range of 5.0 kcal&#183;mol  &#8208;1  . Furthermore, the present simulations did confirm the occurrence of an unusual mechanistic divergence, with two different mechanistic pathways displaying equivalent barriers. An active site water molecule was proposed to influence the mechanistic pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Resolving atomic&#8208;scale defects in conjugated polymers on&#8208;surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomic scale defects significantly affect the mechanical, electronic, and optical properties of &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers. Here we deliberately introduce isolated atomic&#8208;scale defects into a prototypical anthracene&#8208;ethynylene &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer and carefully examine its local density of states on the atomic scale to show how individual defects modify the inherent electronic and magnetic properties of this one&#8208;dimensional systems. Our scanning tunneling and atomic force microscopy experiments, supplemented with density functional theory calculations, reveal the existence of a sharp electronic resonance at the Fermi energy around certain defects, which is associated with the formation of a local magnetic moment accompanied by substantial mitigation of the mobility of charge carriers. While defects in traditionally synthesized polymers lead to arbitrary conformations, our results clearly reflect the preferential formation of low dimensional defects at specific polymer sites, which may introduce the possibility of engineering macroscopic defects in surface&#8208;synthesized conjugated polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Adamantyl Side&#8208;Chains as Anti&#8208;aggregating Moieties in Dyes for Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing and evaluating novel dye concepts is crucial for the development of the field of dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). In our recent report, the novel concept of tethering the anti&#8208;aggregation additive chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) to dyes for DSSC was introduced. Based on the performance improvements seen for this modification, the aim of this study is to see if a simplified anti&#8208;aggregation unit could achieve similar results. The following study reports the synthesis and photovoltaic characterization of two novel dyes decorated with the steric ethyladamantyl moiety on the &#960;&#8208;spacer, and on the triarylamine donor. This modification is demonstrated to be successful in increasing the photovoltages in devices employing copper&#8208;based electrolytes compared to the non&#8208;modified reference dye. The best photovoltaic performance is achieved by a device prepared with the adamantyl decorated donor dye and CDCA, this device achieves a power conversion efficiency of 6.1% (Short&#8208;circuit current = 8.3 mA cm&#8208;2, Open&#8208;circuit voltage = 1054 mV, Fill factor = 0.69). The improved photovoltaic performance seen for the adamantyl decorated donor demonstrate the potential of ethyladamantyl side chains as a tool to ensure surface protection of TiO2.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;situ Grignard Metalation Method, Part I: Synthesis of Hauser Bases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The  in&#8208;situ Grignard  Metalation Method (  i  GMM) is a straightforward one&#8208;pot procedure to quickly produce multigram amounts of  Hauser  bases R  2  N&#8208;MgBr which are valuable and vastly used metalation reagents and novel electrolytes for magnesium batteries. During addition of bromoethane to a suspension of Mg metal and secondary amine at room temperature in an ethereal solvent, a smooth reaction yields R  2  N&#8208;MgBr under evolution of ethane within a few hours. A  Schlenk  equilibrium is operative, interconverting the  Hauser  bases into their solvated homoleptic congeners Mg(NR  2  )  2  and MgBr  2  depending on the solvent. Scope and preconditions are studied, and side reactions limiting the yield have been investigated. DOSY&#8208;NMR experiments and X&#8208;ray crystal structures of characteristic examples clarify aggregation in solution and the solid state.</dc:description>

         <title>Isopropenyl Esters (iPEs) in Green Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sustainability: This comprehensive review showcases the unique reactivity features of bifunctional isopropenyl esters (iPEs), such as sopropenyl acetate (iPAc), bearing an ester moiety, suitable for irreversible transesterification reactions, while the isopropenyl unsaturation reacts selectively in electrophilic and/or radical additions, as well as in metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Moreover, iPEs can be successfully employed for direct biomass modification (i.&#8201;e., lignin or cellulose) and in tandem esterification&#8208;acetalization reactions.







Abstract
The need for greener compounds able to replace conventional ones with similar reactivity is crucial for the development of sustainable chemistry. Isopropenyl esters (iPEs) represent one eco&#8208;friendly alternative to acyl halides and anhydrides. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the preparation methodologies and reported synthetic applications of iPEs and, in particular, of isopropenyl acetate (iPAc). Intriguingly, the presence of a C=C double bond adjacent to the ester functionality makes iPEs appealing in different chemoselective organic synthesis transformations. For instance, the acyl moiety is suitable for transesterification reactions in presence of different heteroatom&#8208;based nucleophiles (C&#8722;, O&#8722;, N&#8722;, S&#8722;, Se&#8722;); these reactions are irreversible thanks to the formation of acetone, obtained upon keto&#8208;enol tautomerization of the prop&#8208;1&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;ol (isopropenyl) leaving group. Similarly, the unsaturation contained in the isopropenyl synthon could be selectively exploited in organic synthesis for electrophilic and/or radical additions as well as in metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. To conclude, iPEs recently found major interest in the direct modification of biomass (i.e. lignin or cellulose) and in the implementation of tandem reactions of esterification&#8208;acetalization by exploiting the co&#8208;formation of acetone during the reaction.

         <title>Photothermal Catalytic Oxidation of Cinnamyl Alcohol with Hydrogen Peroxide by Gold Nanoparticle/Antimony&#8208;Doped Tin Oxide Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold nanoparticles with different mean sizes were formed on antimony&#8208;doped tin oxide nanocrystals by the temperature&#8208;varied deposition&#8208;precipitation method (Au/ATO NCs). Au/ATO NCs possess strong absorption of ATO NCs in the near&#8208;infrared region due to the Drude excitation in addition to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of Au NPs around 530 nm. Au/ATO NCs show thermally activated catalytic activity for the oxidation of cinnamyl alcohol to cinnamaldehyde by hydrogen peroxide. The catalytic activity increases with a decrease in the mean Au particle size (  d  Au  ) at 5.3 nm &#8804;  d  Au  &#8804; 8.2 nm. Light irradiation (  l  ex  &gt; 660 nm, ~0.5 sun) of Au/ATO NCs gives rise to an increase in the rate of reaction more than two times with ~95% selectivity. Kinetic analyses indicated that the striking enhancement of the reaction stems from the rise in the temperature near the catalyst surface of ~ 30 K due to the photothermal effect of the ATO NCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Reductive Amination of Ketones and Secondary Amines: Breaking the Aliphatic Wall</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;In this research article we bring a new methodology&#8230; that enables the so&#8208;far elusive DRA reaction between purely aliphatic ketones and amines.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202201078).







Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue are Matthieu Jouffroy from Discovery Process Research at Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V. and the group of Rafael Gramage&#8208;Doria at the University of Rennes. The image depicts an Ir&#8208;based catalytic system &#8220;fueled&#8221; by hydrogen for the direct reductive amination of ketones and secondary amines, allowing complex aliphatic tertiary amines to be prepared and, so, new chemical space to be reached.

         <title>Nonbonding/Bonding Molecular Orbital Regulation of Nitrogen&#8211;Boron&#8211; Oxygen&#8208;embedded Blue/Green Multiresonant TADF Emitters with High Efficiency and Color Purity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we synthesized and characterized multiresonant thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) materials embedded with nitrogen&#8211;boron&#8211;oxygen (N&#8211;B&#8211;O), exhibiting colortunability between blue and green, namely NBO , m&#8208;DiNBO , and p&#8208;DiNBO .

2&#8208;Diphenylphosphoryloxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes participate in three&#8208;component, BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2&#8208;promoted hetero&#8208;Diels Alder reactions with aldehydes and protected amines to produce functionalized piperidenes. The advantages of this method include the stability of the enol phosphate functional group in both the 1,3&#8208;diene starting material and in the cycloaddition product, its ease of use as no special solvent or atmosphere manipulations are required, and the synthetic usefulness of the enol phosphate functional group as an electrophilic cross&#8208;coupling partner after the cycloaddition.







Abstract
The utility of 2&#8208;diphenylphosphoryloxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes for the construction of substituted six&#8208;membered nitrogen heterocycles is presented. These dienes undergo boron trifluoride&#8208;promoted aza&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reactions when reacted with imines or related species formed in&#8197;situ using aldehydes and amine derivatives. The stability of the dienes allows this three&#8208;component reaction to be carried out with no special precautions to eliminate water or air. Thirty&#8208;one examples of this process are presented. The usefulness of the enol phosphate functional group is highlighted in further reactions after the cycloaddition step to generate functionalized piperidenes or pyridines.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a series of heterobimetallic Pt/Zn and Pt/Ca complexes to study the effect of proximity of a dicationic base metal on the organometallic Pt species. Varying degrees of Pt&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;Zn and Zn interaction with the bridging Me group are achieved, showcasing snapshots of a hypothetical process of retrotransmetalation from Pt to Zn. In contrast, only weak interactions were observed for Ca with a Pt&#8208;bound Me group. Activation of H 2  , B&#8211;H and Si&#8211;H bonds leads to the formation of hydride&#8208;bridged Pt&#8211;H&#8211;Zn complexes, which is not observed in the absence of Zn, pointing out the importance of metal&#8208;metal cooperation. Reactivity of PtMe 2  /M 2+  with terminal acetylene, water and methanol is also studied, leading to facile protonation of one of the Me group at the Pt center only when Zn is present. This study sheds light at various ways in which the presence of a 2+ metal cation significantly affects the reactivity of a common organoplatinum complex.</dc:description>

Small rings: The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of highly functionalized cyclopropanes from &#945;&#8208;substituted allyl sulfones is described.

Abstract
The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of highly functionalized cyclopropanes from &#945;&#8208;substituted allyl sulfones and silanes is reported. The reaction, using &#945;&#8208;aryl diazoacetates or diacceptor diazo reagents, catalyzed by a chiral rhodium complex (Rh2((S)&#8208;BTPCP)4), furnished the corresponding cyclopropanes in moderate to high yields (27&#8211;97&#8201;%), high diastereoselectivities (68&#8201;:&#8201;32 to 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 d.r.) and moderate to excellent ee (40&#8211;99&#8201;%). This methodology offers a privileged access to an underexplored class of enantioenriched cyclopropanes with a high level of functionality, an asset for further post&#8208;functionalization and their incorporation into more complex structure.

The reaction, using &#945;-aryl diazoacetates or diacceptor diazo reagents, catalyzed by a chiral rhodium complex (Rh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;((&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-BTPCP)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), furnished the corresponding cyclopropanes in moderate to high yields (27&#8211;97&#8201;%), high diastereoselectivities (68&#8201;:&#8201;32 to 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 d.r.) and moderate to excellent ee (40&#8211;99&#8201;%). This methodology offers a privileged access to an underexplored class of enantioenriched cyclopropanes with a high level of functionality, an asset for further post-functionalization and their incorporation into more complex structure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Binding of VIVO2+, VIVOL, VIVOL2 and VVO2L Moieties to Proteins: X&#8208;ray/Theoretical Characterization and Biological Implications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pharmacologically active VIVOL2 complexes (L=2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine, 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, picolinato) undergo hydrolysis, exchange of ligands, and redox processes to form VIVOL2/VIVOL/VVO2L/VIVO2+&#8722;protein adducts with lysozyme and trypsin, with the binding of Asp, Asn, and Ser residues, that might contribute to their biological activity. X&#8208;ray diffraction and computational studies suggest the critical role of hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds and microsolvation in the stabilization of these structures.







Abstract
Vanadium compounds have frequently been proposed as therapeutics, but their application has been hampered by the lack of information on the different V&#8208;containing species that may form and how these interact with blood and cell proteins, and with enzymes. Herein, we report several resolved crystal structures of lysozyme with bound VIVO2+ and VIVOL2+, where L=2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine or 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (phen), and of trypsin with VIVO(picolinato)2 and VVO2(phen)+ moieties. Computational studies complete the refinement and shed light on the relevant role of hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds, and microsolvation in stabilizating the structure. Noteworthy is that the trypsin&#8722;VVO2(phen) and trypsin&#8722;VIVO(OH)(phen) adducts correspond to similar energies, thus suggesting a possible interconversion under physiological/biological conditions. The obtained data support the relevance of hydrolysis of VIV and VV complexes in the several types of binding established with proteins and the formation of different adducts that might contribute to their pharmacological action, and significantly widen our knowledge of vanadium&#8211;protein interactions.

         <title>Driving the Active Site Incorporation in Zeolitic Materials via the Organic Structure&#8208;Directing Agent Through Development of H&#8208;Bonds with Hydroxyl Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(1S,2S)&#8208;N&#8208;methyl&#8208;pseudoephedrine used as organic structure&#8208;directing agent for the synthesis of Mg&#8208;doped aluminophosphates is able to control the spatial distribution of low&#8208;valent dopants through the development of H&#8208;bonds with MgO4 tetrahedra, providing a new strategy for controlling the active site spatial distribution in zeolite catalysts.







Abstract
(1S,2S)&#8208;N&#8208;methyl&#8208;pseudoephedrine (MPS) was used as organic structure&#8208;directing agent (OSDA) for the synthesis of Mg&#8208;doped nanoporous aluminophosphates. This molecule displays a particular conformational behavior, where the presence of H&#8208;bond donor and acceptor groups provide a rigid conformational space with one asymmetric conformation preferentially occurring. MPS drives the crystallization of Mg&#8208;containing AFI materials. Characterization of these materials shows that the OSDA incorporate as protonated species, arranged as head&#8208;to&#8208;tail monomers. Combination of three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction with high&#8208;resolution synchrotron powder X&#8208;ray diffraction allowed to locate both the Mg and the organic species. Interestingly, results showed that the spatial incorporation of Mg is driven by the hydroxyl groups of the organic cation through the development of H&#8208;bonds with negatively&#8208;charged MgO4 tetrahedra. This work demonstrates that H&#8208;bond forming groups can be used to drive the spatial incorporation of low&#8208;valent dopants within zeolitic frameworks, a highly desired aim in order to control their catalytic activity and selectivity.

         <title>Nickel and Copper Catalyzed ipso&#8208;Phosphonodifluoromethylation of Arylboronic Acids with BrCF2P(O)(OEt)2 for the Synthesis of Phosphonodifluoromethylarenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The presented method allows the preparation of ipso&#8208;phosphonodifluoromethylarenes utilizing a heterobimetallic catalytic system of nickel and copper. The protocol represents an advantage over traditional palladium catalysed Suzuki coupling due to the short reaction times and the use of earth&#8208;abundant metals.







Abstract
A convenient method for the direct ipso&#8208;phosphonodifluoromethylation of arylboronic acids via nickel&#8208;copper co&#8208;catalysis is disclosed. This work, which utilizes inexpensive first row transition metals, represents a facile alternative to the traditional palladium catalyzed approach. The method utilizes inexpensive commodity chemicals and substrates while tolerating a variety of biologically relevant functional groups. Structurally diverse phosphonodifluoromethylarenes are furnished in good yields under short reaction times. Control experiments to probe possible reaction pathways are also included.

         <title>Photochemical Synthesis of the Bioactive Fragment of Salbutamol and Derivatives in a Self&#8208;Optimizing Flow Chemistry Platform</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of a photochemical route towards an important &#946;&#8208;amino alcohol using a self&#8208;optimizing flow chemistry platform is reported in this work. The methodology enables rapid construction of 2&#8208;oxazolidinone. The key photochemical steps for the construction of the aryl vicinyl amino alcohol moiety consist of a C&#8722;C bond forming reaction followed by an unprecedented, high yielding (&gt;80&#8201;%), benzylic oxidative cyclization.







Abstract
The implementation of self&#8208;optimizing flow reactors has been mostly limited to model reactions or known synthesis routes. In this work, a self&#8208;optimizing flow photochemistry platform is used to develop an original synthesis of the bioactive fragment of Salbutamol and derivatives. The key photochemical steps for the construction of the aryl vicinyl amino alcohol moiety consist of a C&#8722;C bond forming reaction followed by an unprecedented, high yielding (&gt;80&#8201;%), benzylic oxidative cyclization.

         <title>Reactions of Mesityl Azide with Ferrocene&#8208;Based N&#8208;Heterocyclic Germylenes, Stannylenes and Plumbylenes, Including PPh2&#8208;Functionalised Congeners</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The active PbII/P Lewis pair nature of a PPh2&#8208;functionalised ferrocene&#8208;based N&#8208;heterocyclic plumbylene is demonstrated by its reaction with mesityl azide to afford a phosphazide, which is in contrast to the inertness of the unfunctionalised congener. The lighter analogues most likely react with MesN3 at their respective tetrel atom EII, leading to the formation of N2 and an EIV=NMes unit, followed by NMes transfer from the EIV to the PIII atom.

The reactivity of ferrocene&#8208;based N&#8208;heterocyclic tetrylenes [{Fe(&#951;5&#8722;C5H4&#8722;NSitBuMe2)2}E] (E=Ge, Sn, Pb) towards mesityl azide (MesN3) is compared with that of PPh2&#8208;functionalised congeners exhibiting two possible reaction sites, namely the EII and PIII atom. For E=Ge and Sn the reaction occurs at the EII atom, leading to the formation of N2 and an EIV=NMes unit. The germanimines are sufficiently stable for isolation. The stannanimines furnish follow&#8208;up products, either by [2+3] cycloaddition with MesN3 or, in the PPh2&#8208;substituted case, by NMes transfer from the SnIV to the PIII atom. Whereas [{Fe(&#951;5&#8722;C5H4&#8722;NSitBuMe2)2}Pb] and other diaminoplumbylenes studied are inert even under forcing conditions, the PPh2&#8208;substituted congener forms an addition product with MesN3, thus showing a behaviour similar to that of frustrated Lewis pairs. The germylenes of this study afford copper(I) complexes with CuCl, including the first structurally characterised linear dicoordinate halogenido complex [CuX(L)] with a heavier tetrylene ligand L.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The active Pb&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;/P Lewis pair nature&lt;/b&gt; of a PPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-functionalised ferrocene-based N-heterocyclic plumbylene is demonstrated by its reaction with mesityl azide to afford a phosphazide, which is in contrast to the inertness of the unfunctionalised congener. The lighter analogues most likely react with MesN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; at their respective tetrel atom E&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;, leading to the formation of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and an E&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;=NMes unit, followed by NMes transfer from the E&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; to the P&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; atom.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Reductive Amination of Ketones and Secondary Amines: Breaking the Aliphatic Wall</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iridium&#8208;catalyzed methodology leads to fully aliphatic tertiary amines starting from readily available ketones and amines. This direct reductive amination transformation, fueled by hydrogen similar to a space rocket, enables access to an unprecedented chemical space with a functional group relevance compatible with active pharmaceutical ingredients. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Jouffroy, R. Gramage&#8208;Doria et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201078).

         <title>Radical complexes of nickel(II)/copper(II) and redox non&#8208;innocent MB&#8208;DIPY ligands: unusual stability and strong near&#8208;infrared absorption at lmax ~1300 nm</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The preparation of radicals with intense and redox&#8208;switchable absorption beyond 1000 nm is a long&#8208;standing challenge in the chemistry of functional dyes. Here we report the preparation of a series of unprecedented stable neutral nickel(II) and copper(II) complexes of &#8220;Manitoba&#8208;dipyrromethenes&#8221; (MB&#8208;DIPYs) in which the organic chromophore is present in the anion&#8208;radical state. The new stable radicals have an intense absorption at l max ~ 1300 nm and can be either oxidized to a regular [M II (MB&#8208;DIPY)] + (M = Cu or Ni) or reduced to [M II (MB&#8208;DIPY)] &#8208; compounds. The radical nature of the stable [M II (MB&#8208;DIPY)] . radicals was confirmed by EPR spectroscopy with additional insight on their electronic structure obtained by UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, electro&#8208; and spectroelectrochemistry, magnetic measurements, and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The electronic structures and spectroscopic properties of the radical&#8208;based chromophores were also probed by the Density Functional Theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations. These nickel(II) and copper(II) complexes represent the first stable radical compounds with an MB&#8208;DIPY ligand.</dc:description>

         <title>Mass and Charge Transfer Enhancement during Carbon Dioxide Photoreduction by Enhanced Surface Hydrophobicity without Barrier Layer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The CO2  reduction reaction (CRR) represents a promising route for the clean utilization of renewable resources. But mass transfer limitations hinder the step forward seriously. Enhancing the surface hydrophobicity by polymers has been proved to be one of the most efficient strategies. However, as macromolecular organics, polymers on the surface hinder the transfer of charge carriers from catalysts to reactants. Herein, we describe an in&#8208;situ surface fluorination strategy to enhance the surface hydrophobicity of TiO2&#160;  without organics barrier layer, facilitating the mass transfer of CO2  to catalysts and the charge transfer. With less charge transfer obstruction, higher CO2  , and lower H+  surface concentration, the photocatalytic CRR generation rate of methanol (CH3OH) is greatly enhanced up to 247.15 &#956;mol g&#8208;1  h&#8208;1  . Furthermore, we investigate the mechanism of fluorination by experiment and theoretical calculation. Overall, enhancing the surface hydrophobicity of catalysts provides a general and reliable method to improve the competitiveness of CRR.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Observation of Hot Carrier Transfer at Plasmonic Au/Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) Interfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing heterostructures have been demonstrated as an ideal strategy for boosting charge separation on plasmonic photocatalysts, but the detailed interface charge transfer mechanism remains elusive. Herein, we fabricate plasmonic Au and metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs, NH 2 &#8208;MIL&#8208;125 and MIL&#8208;125 used in this work) heterostructures and explore the interface charge transfer mechanism by in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and electrochemical measurements. The plasmon&#8208;excited hot electrons on Au can transfer across the Au/MOF interface and be captured by the coordinatively unsaturated sites of secondary building units (Ti 8 O 8 (OH) 4 cluster) of the MOF structure, and the plasmon&#8208;excited hot holes on Au tend to transfer to and be trapped at the functionalized organic ligand (1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate&#8208;NH 2 ). The spatially separated hot electrons and holes exhibit boosted the photocatalytic activity for chromium (VI) reduction and selective benzyl alcohol oxidation. This work illustrates the advantage of the versatile functionalization of MOF structures enabling molecular&#8208;level manipulation of interface charge transfer on plasmonic photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Aggregation Modes of Chiral Diketopyrrolo[3,4&#8208;c]pyrrole Dyes in Solution and Thin Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chiroptical features of chiral diketopyrrolo[3,4&#8208;  c  ]pyrrole (DPP) derivatives have been only marginally investigated to date. In this regard, we have synthesized  ad hoc  four chiral DPP dyes, functionalized with enantiopure alkyl groups from natural sources either on the lactam moieties or on the terminal positions of &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone, to promote an efficient self&#8208;assembly into chiral supramolecular structures. For each of them, the aggregation modes has been investigated by absorbance and ECD spectroscopies in conditions of solution aggregation and thin films, considering the effects of deposition technique (drop casting  vs.  spin coating) and post&#8208;deposition operations (solvent and thermal annealing). The effect of the structure of lateral &#960;&#8208;conjugated units attached to the central DPP scaffold, as well as that of the position of the alkyl chiral group, has been assessed. ECD revealed superior capability, compared to absorbance spectroscopy, to provide information on the aggregation modes and to detect the possible co&#8208;existence of multiple aggregation pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselectivity is in the Details: Minor Changes Yield Major Improvements to the Synthesis of Bedaquiline</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bedaquiline is a crucial medicine in the global fight against tuberculosis, yet its high price places it out of reach for many patients. Herein, we describe improvements to the key industrial lithiation&#8208;addition sequence that enable a higher yielding and therefore more economical synthesis of bedaquiline. Prioritization of mechanistic understanding and multi&#8208;lab reproducibility led to optimized reaction conditions that feature an unusual base&#8211;salt pairing and afford a doubling of the yield of racemic bedaquiline. We anticipate that implementation of these improvements on manufacturing scale will be facile, thereby substantially increasing the accessibility of this essential medication.</dc:description>

Compounds  1  &#8208;  7  adopt a common 2D layered structure in which 1D silver&#8208;perfluorcarboxylate chains are crosslinked by ditopic quinoxaline ligands. Solid&#8208;state reaction upon heating, involving loss of one equivalent of quinoxaline, yielding new crystalline  4:4:3 phases  [Ag  4  (O  2  C(CF  2  )  n&#8208;1  CF  3  )  4  (quin)  3  ]  n  (  8  &#8208;  10  , n = 1 to 3), was followed  in situ  by PXRD and TGA studies.

The solid&#8208;state reaction converting  4:4:4  to  4:4:3 phase  materials involves cleavage and formation of Ag&#8211;N and Ag&#8211;O bonds to enable the structural rearrangement.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Installation of Dehydroamino Acid Motifs into Peptides Enabled by an N&#8208;Chloropeptide Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A N&#8208;chloropeptide strategy enables the rapid construction of &#916;AA&#8208;containing peptides. The quinuclidine (ABCO)&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;chlorination of peptide bonds and the subsequent &#946;&#8208;elimination of N&#8208;chloroamide efficiently provides &#916;AA&#8208;containing peptides in high yield. The strategy enables the late&#8208;stage installation of &#916;AA motifs into oligopeptides that have already been constructed, including into a macrocyclic peptide. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Nanjo, Y. Takemoto, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201120).

         <title>Do Antarafacial Cycloadditions Occur? Cycloaddition of Heptafulvalene with Tetracyanoethylene.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cycloaddition of heptafulvalene ( 1 ) with tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) was previously described as an example of an antarafacial cycloaddition, a [&#960; 14 a +&#960; 2 s ] process that afforded only the trans &#8208;cycloadduct by virtue of an edge&#8208;to&#8208;face approach of TCNE, facilitated by the S&#8208;shape of 1 . The reaction has been investigated in depth and found not to be a concerted antarafacial process. At low temperature, the reaction is observed to give a mixture of cis &#8208; and trans &#8208;cycloadducts as well as a [4+2] cycloadduct. The mixture of products is converted to the trans &#8208;cycloadduct by equilibration upon warming to room temperature. Studies with diethyl 2,3&#8208;dicyanofumarate and &#8208;maleate confirmed the formation of cis &#8208;cycloadducts. DFT studies at the M06&#8208;2X/6&#8208;311+G(2d,p),&#160;SCRF=acetone level of theory show that the originally proposed edge&#8208;to&#8208;face approach of TCNE to 1 is highly disfavored, while a stepwise mechanism involving addition of TCNE at C2 to form a zwitterion followed by collapse at either C2&#8217; or C7&#8217; is energetically accessible. The Diels&#8208;Alder adduct is also formed in a stepwise reaction by competitive addition of TCNE at C4 of 1 . These studies suggest that edge&#8208;to&#8208;face interactions are prohibitive in even the most favorable cases.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactions of diethylazo&#8208;dicarboxylate with Frustrated Lewis pairs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract : Reactions of PAr 3 /B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 (Ar = o &#8208;Tol, Mes, Ph) FLPs with diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD) afford the corresponding FLP addition products 1&#8208;3 in which P&#8208;N and B&#8208;O linkages are formed. In contrast, the reaction of BPh 3 , PPh 3 and DEAD gave the product 4 where P&#8208;N and N&#8208;B binding was confirmed. In all cases, other binding modes were computed to be both higher in energy and readily distinguishable by 31 P and 11 B NMR parameters. These data clarify the binding mode in previously reported FLP polymers and illustrate the influence of steric demands and electronic structures on the nature of the products of FLP reactions with DEAD.</dc:description>

These data clarify the binding mode in previously reported FLP polymers and illustrate the influence of steric demands and electronic structures on the nature of the products of FLP reactions with DEAD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We hereby disclose, a visible light mediated addition of sulfenyl radicals to trialkyl phosphites to access functionalized phosphorothioates. The use of cheap and readily available Eosin Y as a photocatalyst under mild energy efficient conditions bypassing the use of external oxidants forms the chief highlight of the work. The protocol is scalable and mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction proceeds through an ionic&#8208;Arbuzov like pathway from phosphoranyl radicals.</dc:description>

         <title>The mechanism of biochemical NO&#8208;sensing: insights from computational chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Binding of small gas molecules, such as NO and CO plays a major role in the signaling routes of the human body. The sole NO&#8208;receptor in humans is soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) &#8211; a histidine&#8208;ligated heme protein, which, upon NO binding, activates a downstream signaling cascade. Impairment of NO&#8208;signaling is linked, among others, to cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases. In the present work, we use a combination of theoretical tools such as MD simulations, high&#8208;level quantum chemical calculations and hybrid QM/MM methods to address various aspects of NO binding and to elucidate the most likely reaction paths and the potential intermediates of the reaction. As a model system, the H&#8208;NOX protein from  Shewanella oneidensis  (So H&#8208;NOX) homologous to the NO&#8208;binding domain of sGC is used. The signaling route is predicted to involve NO binding to form a six&#8208;coordinate intermediate heme&#8208;NO complex, followed by relatively facile His decoordination yielding a five&#8208;coordinate adduct with NO on the distal side with possible isomerization to the proximal side through binding of a second NO and release of the first one. MD simulations show that the His sidechain can quite easily rotate outward into solvent, with this motion being accompanied in our simulations by shifts in helix positions that are consistent with this decoordination leading to significant conformational change in the protein.</dc:description>

         <title>Noncovalent interactions involving group 6 in biological systems: The case of Molybdopterin and Tungstopterin cofactors.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study we propose to coin the term Wolfium bond (WfB) to refer to a net attractive force (noncovalent interaction) between any element of group 6 and electron donor atoms (neutral molecules or anions) and to differentiate it from a coordination bond (metal&#8211;ligand interaction). We provide evidence of the existence of this interaction by inspecting the X&#8208;ray crystal structure of proteins containing Molybdopterin and Tungstopterin cofactors from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The plausible biological role of the interaction as well as its physical nature (antibonding Wf&#8211;Ligand orbital involved) are also analyzed by means of  ab initio  calculations (RI&#8208;MP2/def2&#8208;TZVP level of theory), Atoms in Molecules (AIM), Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) and Noncovalent Interactions plot (NCIplot) analyses.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon Dots for Carbon Dummies: The Quantum and The Molecular Questions Among Some Others</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon Dots (CDs) are carbon nanoparticles which were discovered in 2004. Despite two decades of intensive work from the scientific community and a colossal amount of gathered experimental data, no definitive consensus exists to date on several key aspects such as the actual definition of CDs and the origin of their emissive properties. This review proposes a critical evaluation of these fundamental questions. Lay persons will also find here an alternative introduction to the CDs domain, including synthetic strategies, photophysical properties, as well as challenges and outlook of this exciting new area.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore zeolites have great application potential in various industrial fields, such as oil refinery, fine chemicals and biomass processing. Herein, we report the synthesis of an extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore germanosilicate zeolite (named NUD&#8208;13) by using an easily obtained aromatic organic cation 1,2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;3&#8208;propyl&#8208;benzimidazolium as organic structure&#8208;directing agents.&#160;NUD&#8208;13 possesses a rare 15&#8208;member ring extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore channel intersecting with two elliptical 12&#8208;member ring channels, which is isostructural to germanosilicate zeolite GeZA synthesized by using triphenylsulfonium. The germanium in NUD&#8208;13 can be partially substituted by acid treatment to obtain stable high silica zeolite. In addition, aluminium is added into the framework of NUD&#8208;13 during the post&#8208;synthesis treatment process, which provides a foundation for catalytic application.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A highly water&#8208; and air&#8208;stable Fe(II) complex with the quinol&#8208;containing macrocyclic ligand H  4  qp4 reacts with H  2  O  2  to yield Fe(III) complexes with less highly chelating forms of the ligand that have either one or two  para  &#8208;quinones. The reaction increases the  T  1  &#8208;weighted relaxivity over four&#8208;fold, enabling the complex to detect H  2  O  2  using clinical MRI technology. The iron&#8208;containing sensor differs from its recently characterized manganese analog, which also detects H  2  O  2  , in that it is the oxidation of the metal center, rather than the ligand, that primarily enhances the relaxivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic strategies in Aminocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synergistic catalysis offers the unique possibility of simultaneous activations of both the nucleophile and the electrophile in a reaction. A requirement for this strategy is the stability of the active species towards the reaction conditions and the two concerted catalytic cycles. Since the beginning of the century, aminocatalysis has been established as a platform for the stereoselective activation of carbonyl compounds  via  HOMO&#8208;raising or LUMO&#8208;lowering. The burgeoning era of aminocatalysis has been driven by the deep understanding of these activation and stereoinduction modes, thanks to the introduction of versatile and privileged chiral amines. The aim of the present review is to cover the recent developments of synergistic strategies involving aminocatalysis in combination with organo&#8208;, metal&#8208;, photo&#8208;, and electro&#8208;catalysis, focusing on the evolution of privileged aminocatalysts architectures.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Synergistic catalysis offers the unique possibility of simultaneous activations of both the nucleophile and the electrophile in a reaction. A requirement for this strategy is the stability of the active species towards the reaction conditions and the two concerted catalytic cycles. Since the beginning of the century, aminocatalysis has been established as a platform for the stereoselective activation of carbonyl compounds  via  HOMO-raising or LUMO-lowering. The burgeoning era of aminocatalysis has been driven by the deep understanding of these activation and stereoinduction modes, thanks to the introduction of versatile and privileged chiral amines. The aim of the present review is to cover the recent developments of synergistic strategies involving aminocatalysis in combination with organo-, metal-, photo-, and electro-catalysis, focusing on the evolution of privileged aminocatalysts architectures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Tetraaryl&#8208;21,23&#8208;dirhodaporphyrin and a series of related monorhodaporphyrins have been obtained via a tellurium&#8208;to&#8208;rhodium exchange in a reaction of tetraaryl&#8208;21,23&#8208;ditelluraporphyrin with [RhCl(CO)  2  ]  2  . These organometallic metallaporphyrins contain rhodium(III) centers embedded in rhodacyclopentadiene rings, incorporated within the porphyrin frames. The skeletons of 21,23&#8208;dirhodaporphyrin and 21&#8208;rhoda&#8208;23&#8208;telluraporphyrin are strongly in&#8208;plane deformed from the rectangular shape typical for porphyrins, due to rhodium(III) coordination preferences, the large size of two core atoms, and the porphyrin skeleton constrains. These two metallaporphyrins exhibit fluxional behavior, studied by  1  H NMR and DFT, involving the in&#8208;plane motion and the switch of the rhodium center(s) between two nitrogen donors. A side&#8208;product detected in the reaction mixture, 21&#8208;oxa&#8208;23&#8208;rhodaporphyrin, results from tellurium&#8208;to&#8208;oxygen exchange, occurring parallelly to the tellurium&#8208;to&#8208;rhodium exchange. The reaction paths and mechanisms are analysed. The title 21,23&#8208;dirhodaporphyrin contains a bridged bimetallic unit, Rh  2  Cl  2  , in the center of the macrocycle, with two rhodium(III) ions, lying approximately in&#8208;plane of the porphyrinoid skeleton. The geometry of the implanted Rh  2  Cl  2  unit is affected by macrocyclic constrains.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The synthesis of new morphinan opioids by the addition of photochemically generated carbon&#8208;centered radicals to substrates containing an enone in the morphinan C&#8208;ring, is described. Using tetrabutylammonium decatungstate (TBADT) as a hydrogen atom transfer photocatalyst, diverse radical donors can be used to prepare a variety of C8&#8208;functionalized morphinan opioids.

         <title>Infrared spectroscopy elucidates the inhibitor binding sites in a metal&#8208;dependent formate dehydrogenase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biological carbon dioxide (CO  2  ) reduction is an important step by which organisms form valuable energy&#8208;richer molecules required for further metabolic processes. The Mo&#8208;dependent formate dehydrogenase (FDH) from  Rhodobacter capsulatus  catalyzes reversible formate oxidation to CO  2  at a bis&#8208;molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide (bis&#8208;MGD) cofactor. To elucidate potential substrate binding sites we studied herein the interaction with the inhibitory molecules azide and cyanate, which are isoelectronic to CO  2  and charged as formate. We employed infrared (IR) spectroscopy in combination with density functional theory (DFT) and inhibition kinetics. One distinct inhibitory molecule was found to bind to either a non&#8208;competitive or a competitive binding site in the secondary coordination sphere of the active site. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis of key amino acid residues in the vicinity of the bis&#8208;MGD cofactor revealed changes in both non&#8208;competitive and competitive binding. The absence of the cofactor and the adjacent Arg587 hampers exclusively the competitive interaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural and ITC Characterization of Peptide&#8208;Protein Binding: Thermodynamic Consequences of Cyclization Constraints, a Case Study on Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocyclization constraints are widely used in the design of protein ligands to stabilize their bioactive conformation and increase their affinities. However, the resulting changes in binding entropy can be puzzling and uncorrelated to affinity gains. Here we report the thermodynamic (Isothermal Titration Calorimetry) and structural (X&#8208;ray, NMR and CD) analysis of a complete series of lactam&#8208;bridged peptide ligands of the vascular endothelial growth factor, and their unconstrained analogs. We show that differences in thermodynamics arise mainly from the folding energy of the peptide upon binding. The systematic reduction in conformational entropy penalty due to helix pre&#8208;organization can be counterbalanced by an unfavorable vibrational entropy change if the constraints are too rigid. The gain in configurational entropy partially escapes the enthalpy/entropy compensation and leads to an improvement in affinity. The precision of the analytical ITC method makes this study a possible benchmark for constrained peptides optimization.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding the reshaping of fluorinated polyester vitrimers by kinetic and DFT studies of the transesterification reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vitrimers are a third class of polymers gathering the mechanical properties and solvent resistance of 3D thermosets and the reprocessability of thermoplastics. This unique behaviour is due to the triggering of certain covalent exchange reactions that allow the network to rearrange upon application of a stimulus. The constitutive feature of vitrimers is the adoption of a glass&#8208;like viscosity during the rearrangement of the network, often due to an associative mechanism for the exchange reaction. Transesterification networks are one of the most studied type of vitrimers that usually require the incorporation of a catalyst, implying the associated drawbacks. Our group recently reported catalyst&#8208;free transesterification vitrimers in which the ester functions are particularly reactive thanks to the presence of fluorine atoms in a&#8208; or b&#8208;position. In the present contribution, we present parallel DFT calculations and an experimental kinetic study on model molecules in order to quantitatively assess the effect of neighbouring fluorinated groups on the transesterification reaction rate.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Electro&#8208;Synthesis Approach to Amaryllidaceae Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amaryllidaceae alkaloids appeal to organic chemists with their attractive structures and their impressive antitumor and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory properties. We demonstrate a highly versatile access to this family of natural products. A general protocol with high yields in a sustainable electro&#8208;organic key transformation on a metal&#8208;free anode to spirodienones facilitates functionalization to the alkaloids. The biomimetic syntheses start with the readily available, inexpensive biogenic starting materials methyl gallate, O&#8208;methyl tyramine, and vanillin derivatives. Through known dynamic resolutions, this technology provides access to both enantiomeric series of martidine, (epi&#8208;)crinine, siculine, and galantamine, clinically prescribed for the treatment of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease.</dc:description>
