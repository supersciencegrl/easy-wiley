         <title>Sulfone/Carbonyl&#8208;Based Donor&#8208;Acceptor Fluorescent Dyes: Synthesis, Structures, Photophysical Properties and Cell Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electron&#8208;accepting units play vital roles in constructing donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) conjugated organic optoelectronic materials, the electronic structures and functions of the acceptors are needed to carefully unveil to controllably tailor the optoelectronic properties. Herein, we synthesized two D&#8208;A conjugated organic fluorophores (named TPA&#8208;SO and TPA&#8208;CO) with similar molecular skeletons based on sulfone or carbonyl contained polycyclic aromatic acceptors. For strong intramolecular charge transfer processes, both TPA&#8208;SO and TPA&#8208;CO display obvious solvent polarity&#8208;dependent photophysical properties and large Stokes shift of over 100 nm. The experimental evidences indicate sulfone group in TPA&#8208;SO merely serves as a strong electron&#8208;withdrawing unit, and TPA&#8208;SO shows yellowish&#8208;green emission with an emission peak at 542 nm and absolute photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 98% in solution, while the carbonyl group in TPA&#8208;CO can act as both electron&#8208;withdrawing unit and spin transition convertor, so TPA&#8208;CO displays red emission with a low absolute PLQY of 0.32% in solution. Impressively, from solution to aggregate state, TPA&#8208;SO nanoparticles keep high PLQY of 9.5% and good biocompatibility, which are good nanoprobes for cellular fluorescence imaging. The results reveal that the inherent characteristic of acceptors acts as a crucial effect in the photophysical properties and applications of the organic fluorophores.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Living Supramolecular Polymerization: Improvement in Edge Roughness of Supramolecular Nanosheets by Using a Dummy Monomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymers are formed through nucleation (i.e., initiation) and polymerization processes, and kinetic control over the nucleation process has recently led to the realization of living supramolecular polymerization. Changing the viewpoint, herein we focus on controlling the polymerization process, which we expect to pave the way to further developments in controlled supramolecular polymerization. In our previous study, two&#8208;dimensional living supramolecular polymerization was used to produce supramolecular nanosheets with a controlled area; however, these had rough edges. In this study, the growth of the nanosheets was controlled by using a &#8216;dummy&#8217; monomer to produce supramolecular nanosheets with smoothed edges.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Phenothiazinone as Fluorophore and its Application in Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phenothiazinone is a promising yet underutilized fluorophore, possibly due to the lack of a general accessibility. Herein, we report a robust and scalable TEMPO&#8208;mediated electrochemical method to access a variety of phenothiazinones from 2&#8208;aminothiophenols and quinones. The electrosynthesis proceeds in a simple cell architecture under mild condition, and notably carbon&#8211;halogen bond in quinones remains compared to conventional methods, enabling orthogonal downstream functionalization. Mechanistic studies corroborate that TEMPO exert a protective effect in avoiding product decomposition at the cathode. In particular, benzophenothiazinones show intriguing luminescence in the states of both solid and solution, and thus their photophysical properties are scrutinized in detail. Further bio&#8208;imaging of the lipid droplets in living cells highlights the considerable promise of benzophenothiazinones as fluorescent dye in the biomedical fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Assembling Molecular Clips To Build &#960;&#8208;Stacks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nature utilizes an intimate stacking of aromatic motifs to construct functional structures, as demonstrated in protein folding and polynucleotide assembly. However, organized &#960;&#8208;stacks of artificial molecules are difficult to build, primarily due to the weak, non&#8208;directional, and context&#8208;sensitive nature of van der Waals forces. To overcome these challenges, chemists have invented ingenious architectural designs to construct &#960;&#8208;stacked supramolecular assemblies using clip&#8208;like molecules. This CONCEPT article focuses on molecular clips that offer precise spatial control over assembly patterns, beyond the scope of simple host&#8211;guest chemistry. We analyze and compare different design strategies that leverage non&#8208;covalent interactions to create multi&#8208;layer &#960;&#8208;stacks. Particular emphasis is placed on the choice of spine units as they play a crucial role in controlling the (i) spacing, (ii) orientation, and (iii) conformational pre&#8208;organization of linked aromatics to achieve long&#8208;range spatial ordering.</dc:description>

         <title>Regiocontrol via Electronics: Insights into a Ru&#8208;Catalyzed, Cu&#8208;Mediated Site&#8208;Selective Alkylation of Isoquinolones via a C&#8722;C Bond Activation of Cyclopropanols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ru&#8208;catalyzed, Cu&#8208;mediated site&#8208;selective, C3/C4&#8208;alkylation of N&#8208;pyridylisoquinolones is achieved. The reaction pathway is characterized by open&#8208;shell singlet and triplet energy pathways arising from the bimetallic complex. Regioselectivity arises from the energies of the two states. While the electron&#8208;donating groups primarily afford the unprecedented C(4)&#8208;isomer, electron&#8208;withdrawing groups show an inclination towards the C(3)&#8208;product.







Abstract
A site&#8208;selective C(3)/C(4)&#8208;alkylation of N&#8208;pyridylisoquinolones is achieved by employing C&#8722;C bond activation of cyclopropanols under Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed/Cu(II)&#8208;mediated conditions. The regioisomeric ratios of the products follow directly from the electronic nature of the cyclopropanols and isoquinolones used, with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups yielding predominantly the C(3)&#8208;alkylated products, whereas the electron&#8208;donating groups primarily generate the C(4)&#8208;alkylated isomers. Density functional theory calculations and detailed mechanistic investigations suggest the simultaneous existence of the singlet and triplet pathways for the C(3)&#8208; and C(4)&#8208;product formation. Further transformations of the products evolve the utility of the methodology thereby yielding scaffolds of synthetic relevance.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3&#8208;Benzylidene&#8208;indoline&#8208;2&#8208;ones are of great importance for the pharmaceutical industry. These compounds have been extensively reported for their biological properties, but have hardly been studied concerning their photochemical activity. Here, we present 3&#8208;benzylidene&#8208;indoline&#8208;2&#8208;ones as a promising class of photoswitches with high yields, robust photochemical switching, and quantum yields reaching up to 50&#8201;%.







Abstract
3&#8208;Benzylidene&#8208;indoline&#8208;2&#8208;ones play a prominent role in the pharmaceutical industry due to the diverse biomedical applications of oxindole heterocycles. Despite the extensive reports on their biological properties, these compounds have hardly been studied for their photochemical activity. Here, we present 3&#8208;benzylidene&#8208;indoline&#8208;2&#8208;ones as a promising class of photoswitches with high yields, robust photochemical switching with quantum yields reaching up to 50&#8201;% and potential for biological applications.

         <dc:description>
A novel route using Schreiner thiourea mediated organocatalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition reaction of nitroolefins with diverse azides is devised to furnish high yield of 1,5&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazolyl glycoconjugates. The method has some notable features including metal&#8208;free, straightforward, acid&#8208;free, excellent regioselectivity operationally simple, wide substrate scope and high yielding. The Schreiner thiourea organocatalysts enable the required activation of nitroolefins through double hydrogen bonding.







Abstract
A novel organocatalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition reaction of nitroolefins with glycosyl azides as well as organic azides has been developed for successful construction of 1,5&#8208;disubstituted triazolyl glycoconjugates. This metal&#8208;free and acid&#8208;free, regioselective synthetic protocol proceeds in the presence of only Schreiner thiourea organocatalysts, which enable the required activation of nitroolefins through double hydrogen bonding. The straightforward, operationally simple, and regioselectivity of this methodology, complementing to the classical RuAAC catalyzed synthesis of 1,5&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles. In the presence of catalytic amount of Schreiner thiourea organocatalyst, organic azides react with a broad array of nitroolefins producing a series of diverse 1,5&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208; triazoles in good yields with excellent regioselectivity.

Ag10hpbt, Ag12bpva and Ag12bpb exemplify the first luminescent silver cluster&#8208;based coordination polymers used in the sensing of nitrobenzene through fluorescence quenching.







Abstract
Nitrobenzene (NB) is a highly toxic chemical and a cause for concern to human health and the environment. Hence, it is worth designing new efficient and robust sensing platforms for NB. In this study, we present three newly synthesized luminescent silver cluster&#8208;based coordination polymers, {[Ag10(StBu)6(CF3COO)4(hpbt)] (DMAc)2(CH3CN)2}n (hpbt=N,N,N&#8217;,N'N&#8221;,N&#8221;&#8208;hexa(pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;yl)benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triamine), [Ag12(StBu)6(CF3COO)6(bpva)3]n (bpva=9,10&#8208;Bis(2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)vinyl)anthracene), and {[Ag12(StBu)6(CF3COO)6(bpb)(DMAc)2(H2O)2] (DMAc)2}n (bpb=1,4&#8208;Bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)benzene) composed of Ag10, Ag12 and Ag12 cluster cores, respectively, connected by multidentate pyridine linkers. In addition, two new luminescent polymorphic silver(I)&#8208;based coordination polymers, [Ag(CF3COO)(dpa)]n (dpa=9,10&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)anthracene) referred to as Agdpa (H) and Agdpa (R), where H and R denote hexagon&#8208; and rod&#8208;like crystal shapes, respectively, have been prepared. The coordination polymers exhibit highly sensitive luminescence quenching effects to NB, attributed to the &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking interactions between the polymers and NB as well as the electron&#8208;withdrawing character of NB.

         <title>Design, Synthesis, and Evaluation of Biological Activity of Ferrocene&#8208;Ispinesib Hybrids: Impact of a Ferrocenyl Group on the Antiproliferative and Kinesin Spindle Protein Inhibitory Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 49, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ferrocenyl&#8208; and adamantyl&#8208;ispinesib hybrids showing significantly higher anticancer activity than ispinesib were designed. The presence of an ispinesb core is responsible for KSP inhibitory activity, whereas bulky ferrocenyl and adamantyl substituents are responsible for increased ability to ROS generation and significantly increased G2/M phase cell arrest of the new compounds.







Abstract
With the aim to combine more than one biologically&#8208;active component in a single molecule, derivatives of ispinesib and its (S) analogue were prepared that featured ferrocenyl moieties or bulky organic substituents. Inspired by the strong kinesin spindle protein (KSP) inhibitory activity of ispinesib, the compounds were investigated for their antiproliferative activity. Among these compounds, several derivatives demonstrated significantly higher antiproliferative activity than ispinesib with nanomolar IC50 values against cell lines. Further evaluation indicated that the antiproliferative activity is not directly correlated with their KSP inhibitory activity while docking suggested that several of the derivatives may bind in a manner similar to ispinesib. In order to investigate the mode of action further, cell cycle analysis and reactive oxygen species formation were investigated. The improved antiproliferative activity of the most active compounds may be assigned to synergic effects of various factors such as KSP inhibitory activity due to the ispinesib core and ability to generate ROS and induce mitotic arrest.

         <title>Oriented External Electric&#8208;Field Effects on the Activation of Aryl CO Bond in Anisole using Rh(PEP) (E=Al, B, Ga) Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 49, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum chemical calculations with density functional theory (DFT) demonstrate the effect of Oriented External Electric Field (OEEF) on the heterolytic activation reactions of the C(sp2)&#8722;O bond in aryl ether compounds, such as anisole, catalysed by Rh&#8722;E (E= Al/B/Ga) complexes. New Rh&#8722;E catalyst complexes with improved activity has also been proposed.







Abstract
The present work reports a DFT&#8208;based mechanistic investigation of aryl C&#8722;O bond activation in anisole catalysed by a Rh&#8722;Al pincer&#8208;type complex at room temperature. The study is extended to analogues Rh&#8722;E complexes based on Group&#8197;13 elements (E=B/Ga). Our results show a preference for the heterolytic cleavage pathway over oxidative addition in the C&#8722;O bond activation. The calculated barriers range from 16 to 36&#8197;kcal/mol, following the order: E=Al&lt;E=Ga&lt;E=B. A strong correlation between the activation barriers and the local electric field (LEF) at the Rh metal centre for the studied Rh&#8722;E complexes was observed. Additionally, the ability of Oriented External Electric Field (OEEF) to lower the reaction barrier by applying the OEEF along the direction of electron reorganization, that is, &#8220;the reaction axis&#8221;, was examined. Our results demonstrate the significant effect of applied OEEF on the aryl C&#8722;O bond activation in Rh&#8722;E systems. Furthermore, the effect of OEEF on the C&#8722;O bond activation using modified Rh&#8722;E (E=B, Al, or Ga) complexes, in which electronic structure modifications enable a more efficient barrier control by the OEEF, was showcased. Notably, applying a moderate field strength reduces the high reaction barrier for the Rh&#8722;B system by approximately 13&#8197;kcal/mol.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Rubicene&#8208;Based Aromatic &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Compounds as Five&#8208;Membered Ring Embedded Planar Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 49, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic compounds having two and three rubicene substructures were synthesized by the Scholl reactions of oligoarene precursors. These nanographene&#8208;like compounds have planar aromatic frameworks, and its length along the long axis reaches 2.8&#8197;nm for the trimer. These compounds showed characteristic absorption and fluorescence bands in the long&#8208;wavelength region owing to small HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps by effective &#960;&#8208;conjugation.







Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons consisting of two or three rubicene substructures were designed as &#960;&#8208;conjugated compounds embedding five&#8208;membered rings. The target compounds with t&#8208;butyl groups were synthesized by the Scholl reaction of precursors consisting of 9,10&#8208;diphenylanthracene units, even though a partially precyclized precursor was required for the synthesis of the trimer. These compounds were isolated as stable and dark blue solids. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis and DFT calculations revealed the planar aromatic framework of these compounds. In the electronic spectra, the absorption and emission bands were considerably red&#8208;shifted compared with those of the reference rubicene compound. In particular, the emission band of the trimer extended to the near&#8208;IR region while retaining the emissive property. The narrowed HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap with the extension of the &#960;&#8208;conjugation was confirmed by cyclic voltammetry and DFT calculations.

New poly&#8208;substituted aza&#8208;bodipy NIR dyes: a combined photophysical, electrochemical and theoretical study.







Abstract
This study presents the synthesis, the spectroscopic and electrochemical properties of new bis&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted azaboron&#8208;dipyrromethene (aza&#8208;BODIPY) dyes substituted by different electron donating groups connected to the aza&#8208;BODIPY core through a thiophene unit. In line with theoretical calculations, experimental measurements point out the positive impact of the thiophene group that behave as a secondary donor group leading to an enhancement of the intramolecular charge transfer process in comparison to previously reported aza&#8208;BODIPY dyes. This heterocycle has also been found to tune the oxidative potential and to stabilize the electro&#8208;generated species.

         <title>Supramolecular Chirogenesis in a Sterically Hindered Porphyrin: A Critical Theoretical Analysis
</title>

How to rationalization the molecular mechanisms of chirogenesis? Using a sterically hindered porphyrin receptor, we provide a blue print for the comprehensive analysis of induced electronic circular dichroism with experimental and computational methods and identify critical geometric factors and possible problems, such as a lack of significant conformations and accidental agreement of experimental and simulated spectra.







Abstract
The determination of molecular stereochemistry and absolute configuration is an important part of modern chemistry, pharmacology, and biology. Electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectroscopy is a widely used tool for chirality assignment, especially with porphyrin macrocycles employed as reporter chromophores. However, the mechanisms of induced ECD in porphyrin complexes are yet to be comprehensively rationalized. In this work, the ECD spectra of a sterically hindered hexa&#8208;cationic porphyrin with two camphorsulfonic acids in dichloromethane and chloroform were experimentally measured and computationally analyzed. The influence of geometric factors such as the position of chiral guest molecules, distortion of the porphyrin macrocycle, and orientation of aromatic and non&#8208;aromatic peripheral substituents on the ECD spectra was theoretically studied. Various potential pitfalls, such as a lack of significant conformations and accidental agreement of experimental and simulated spectra, are considered and discussed.

         <title>Squaramide&#8208;Based Heteroditopic [2]Rotaxanes for Sodium Halide Ion&#8208;Pair Recognition</title>

Rotaxane! Utilizing the Lewis basic carbonyl moieties of the squaramide motif, a series of squaramide&#8208;containing heteroditopic [2]rotaxanes are synthesized via sodium&#8208;cation templation. 1H&#8197;NMR binding studies reveal the bromide and iodide recognition capabilities of these heteroditopic receptors are significantly enhanced by up to ca. 20&#8208;fold in the presence of co&#8208;bound sodium cations, highlighting the unique ambidentate ion&#8208;pair binding nature of squaramides.







Abstract
A series of squaramide&#8208;based heteroditopic [2]rotaxanes consisting of isophthalamide macrocycle and squaramide axle components are synthesized using an alkali metal cation template&#8208;directed stoppering methodology. This work highlights the unprecedented sodium cation template coordination of the Lewis basic squaramide carbonyls for interlocked structure synthesis. Extensive quantitative 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopic anion and ion&#8208;pair recognition studies reveal the [2]rotaxane hosts are capable of cooperative sodium halide ion&#8208;pair mechanical bond axle&#8208;macrocycle component recognition, eliciting up to 20&#8208;fold enhancements in binding strengths for bromide and iodide, wherein the Lewis basic carbonyls and Lewis acidic NH hydrogen bond donors of the squaramide axle motif operate as cation and anion receptive sites simultaneously in an ambidentate fashion. Notably, varying the length and nature of the polyether cation binding unit of the macrocycle component dramatically influences the ion&#8208;pair binding affinities of the [2]rotaxanes, even overcoming direct contact NaCl ion&#8208;pair binding modes in polar organic solvents. Furthermore, the cooperative ion&#8208;pair binding properties of the squaramide&#8208;based heteroditopic [2]rotaxanes are exploited to successfully extract solid sodium halide salts into organic media.

         <title>In Situ Formation of CoP/Co3O4 Heterojunction for Efficient Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 49, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CoP/Co3O4@TM (TM=titanium mesh) heterojunction exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and overall water splitting. OER requires an overpotential of 257&#8197;mV to reach 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and can work stably for more than 40&#8197;h, HER requires an overpotential of 98&#8197;mV to reach 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and overall water splitting only needs 1.590&#8197;V to reach 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Electrochemical water splitting is an environmentally friendly and effective energy storage method. However, it is still a huge challenge to prepare non&#8208;noble metal based electrocatalysts that possess high activity and long&#8208;term durability to realize efficient water splitting. Here, we present a novel method of low&#8208;temperature phosphating for preparing CoP/Co3O4 heterojunction nanowires catalyst on titanium mesh (TM) substrate that can be used for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and overall water splitting. CoP/Co3O4@TM heterojunction showed an excellent catalytic performance and long&#8208;term durability in 1.0&#8197;M KOH electrolyte. The overpotential of CoP/Co3O4@TM heterojunction was only 257&#8197;mV at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 during the OER process, and it could work stably more than 40&#8197;h at 1.52&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE). During the HER process, the overpotential of CoP/Co3O4@TM heterojunction was only 98&#8197;mV at &#8722;10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. More importantly, when used as anodic and cathodic electrocatalyst, they achieved 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.59&#8197;V. The Faradaic efficiencies of OER and HER were 98.4&#8201;% and 99.4&#8201;%, respectively, outperforming Ru/Ir&#8208;based noble metal electrocatalysts and other non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.

&lt;p&gt;A CoP/Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@TM (TM=titanium mesh) heterojunction exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and overall water splitting. OER requires an overpotential of 257&#8197;mV to reach 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and can work stably for more than 40&#8197;h, HER requires an overpotential of 98&#8197;mV to reach 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and overall water splitting only needs 1.590&#8197;V to reach 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical water splitting is an environmentally friendly and effective energy storage method. However, it is still a huge challenge to prepare non-noble metal based electrocatalysts that possess high activity and long-term durability to realize efficient water splitting. Here, we present a novel method of low-temperature phosphating for preparing CoP/Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; heterojunction nanowires catalyst on titanium mesh (TM) substrate that can be used for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and overall water splitting. CoP/Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@TM heterojunction showed an excellent catalytic performance and long-term durability in 1.0&#8197;M KOH electrolyte. The overpotential of CoP/Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@TM heterojunction was only 257&#8197;mV at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; during the OER process, and it could work stably more than 40&#8197;h at 1.52&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE). During the HER process, the overpotential of CoP/Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@TM heterojunction was only 98&#8197;mV at &#8722;10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. More importantly, when used as anodic and cathodic electrocatalyst, they achieved 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.59&#8197;V. The Faradaic efficiencies of OER and HER were 98.4&#8201;% and 99.4&#8201;%, respectively, outperforming Ru/Ir-based noble metal electrocatalysts and other non-noble metal electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>2&#8208;Benzamide Tellurenyl Iodides: Synthesis and Their Catalytic Role in CO2 Mitigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 49, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insertion of tellurium into carbon&#8208;iodine bond has been achieved for the first time by a base&#8208;free copper&#8208;catalyzed method for the construction of aryl 2&#8208;benzamide tellurenyl iodides. Furthermore, synthesized tellurenyl iodides were explored for CO2 mitigation to synthesize cyclic carbonates and 1,3&#8208;diaryl ureas, using epoxides and anilines, respectively. In addition, for the first time, the ebtellur intermediate is isolated and characterized by SC&#8208;XRD.







Abstract
Benzamide&#8208;derived organochalcogens (chalcogen=S, Se, and Te) have shown promising interest in biological and synthetic chemistry. Ebselen molecule derived from benzamide moiety is the most studied organoselenium. However, its heavier congener organotellurium is under&#8208;explored. Here, an efficient copper&#8208;catalyzed atom economical synthetic method has been developed to synthesize 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;benzamide tellurenyl iodides by inserting a tellurium atom into carbon&#8208;iodine bond of 2&#8208;iodobenzamides in one pot with 78&#8211;95&#8201;% yields. Further, the Lewis acidic nature of Te center and Lewis basic nature of nitrogen of the synthesized 2&#8208;Iodo&#8208;N&#8208;(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)benzamide tellurenyl iodides enabled them as pre&#8208;catalyst for the activation of epoxide with CO2 at 1&#8197;atm for the preparation of cyclic carbonates with TOF and TON values of 1447&#8197;h&#8722;1 and 4343, respectively, under solvent&#8208;free conditions. In addition, 2&#8208;iodo&#8208;N&#8208;(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)benzamide tellurenyl iodides have also been used as pre&#8208;catalyst for activating anilines and CO2 to form a variety of 1,3&#8208;diaryl ureas up to 95&#8201;% yield. The mechanistic investigation for CO2 mitigation is done by 125Te&#8197;NMR and HRMS studies. It seems that the reaction proceeds via formation of catalytically active Te&#8722;N heterocycle, an ebtellur intermediate which is isolated and structurally characterized.

         <title>Stability and Reversible Oxidation of Sub&#8208;Nanometric Cu5 Metal Clusters: Integrated Experimental Study and Theoretical Modeling
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 49, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combined XANES and NAP XPS study shows that Cu5 clusters are resistant to irreversible oxidation up to 773&#8197;K in the presence of oxygen. A theoretical model reveals that adsorbed O2 molecules are transformed into superoxo and peroxo species by an interplay of collective charge transfer and large amplitude &#8220;breathing&#8221; motions. A chemical phase diagram for Cu oxidation state of the Cu5&#8208;O2 system is presented.







Abstract
Sub&#8208;nanometer metal clusters have special physical and chemical properties, significantly different from those of nanoparticles. However, there is a major concern about their thermal stability and susceptibility to oxidation. In situ X&#8208;ray Absorption spectroscopy and Near Ambient Pressure X&#8208;ray Photoelectron spectroscopy results reveal that supported Cu5 clusters are resistant to irreversible oxidation at least up to 773&#8197;K, even in the presence of 0.15&#8197;mbar of oxygen. These experimental findings can be formally described by a theoretical model which combines dispersion&#8208;corrected DFT and first principles thermochemistry revealing that most of the adsorbed O2 molecules are transformed into superoxo and peroxo species by an interplay of collective charge transfer within the network of Cu atoms and large amplitude &#8220;breathing&#8221; motions. A chemical phase diagram for Cu oxidation states of the Cu5&#8208;oxygen system is presented, clearly different from the already known bulk and nano&#8208;structured chemistry of Cu.

The photocatalyzed reaction between various electron&#8208;deficient aromatic compounds and a non&#8208;stabilized azomethine ylide is successfully performed in a flow system.







Abstract
The photocatalyzed dearomative reaction between various electron&#8208;deficient aromatic compounds and a non&#8208;stabilized azomethine ylide is successfully performed in a flow system. Whereas the use of supported eosin as organic photocatalyst exhibits limited efficiency, turning to the soluble Rose Bengal allows to transform a broad range of substrates from hetarenes (indole, benzofuran, quinoline, pyridine) to naphthalenes and benzenes. This photocatalyzed (3+2) dearomative cycloaddition under green light irradiation provides a simple and efficient access to tridimensional pyrrolidino scaffolds with a tetrasubstituted carbon center at ring junction and can be performed in the friendly ethyl acetate. Computational studies support the mechanism involving azomethine ylide as reactive species toward the electron&#8208;poor arene.

         <title>Formal Synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;Salvinorin A via Gold(I) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 49, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A formal synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;Salvinorin A, a neo clerodane diterpenoid natural product and &#956;&#8208;opioid receptor agonist, is being reported utilizing a double application of gold(I) methodology as a Lewis acid and a photoredox catalyst.







Abstract
The formal synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;salvinorin A is presented. Our approach utilizes two distinct gold(I) catalytic processes. The combination of a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed reaction with an intermolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reaction followed by a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed photoredox reaction generated in eight steps the framework of the natural product with high diastereoselectivity.

&lt;p&gt;The formal synthesis of (&#177;)-salvinorin A is presented. Our approach utilizes two distinct gold(I) catalytic processes. The combination of a gold(I)-catalyzed reaction with an intermolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reaction followed by a gold(I)-catalyzed photoredox reaction generated in eight steps the framework of the natural product with high diastereoselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Infrared Spectroscopic and Theoretical Investigations of Group 13 Oxyfluorides OMF2 and OMF (M=B, Al, Ga, In)</title>

Terminal oxygen radicals involving group 13&#8201;atoms: We investigate herein oxydifluoride OMF2 (M=B, Al, Ga and In) radicals by the reactions of laser&#8208;ablated group 13 atoms with OF2 under cryogenic conditions in solid noble gas matrices. The computed molecular orbitals and spin densities showed that the unpaired electron is mainly located at the terminal oxygen atom.







Abstract
Group 13 oxyfluorides OMF2 were produced by the reactions of laser&#8208;ablated group 13 atoms M (M=B, Al, Ga and In) with OF2 and isolated in excess neon or argon matrices at 5&#8197;K. These molecules were characterized by matrix&#8208;isolation infrared spectroscopy and isotopic substitution experiments in conjunction with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. The calculations indicate that the OMF2 molecules have a 2B2 ground state with C2v symmetry. The computed molecular orbitals and spin densities show that the unpaired electron is mainly located at the terminal oxygen atom. Oxo monofluorides OMF were only observed in solid argon matrices and exhibit a linear structure in the singlet ground state. The M&#8722;O bonding in the OMF molecules can be rationalized as highly polar multiple bonds based on the calculated bond lengths and natural resonance theory (NRT) analyses. In particular, the molecular orbitals of OBF exhibit the character of a triple bond B&#8722;O resulting from two degenerate electron&#8208;sharing &#960; bonds and an O&#8594;B dative &#963; bond formed by the oxygen 2p lone pair which donates electron density to the boron empty 2p orbital.

A novel architecture with no organic isolobal analogue, the bicyclic 3&#8208;mercaptopyrylium rhodium complexes, [Rh(&#954;2&#8208;C,S&#8208;C5S2Ph3)X2(PPh3)2] (X=Cl, Br), arise from thiocarbonyl&#8208;cyclopropenium coupling.







Abstract
Addition of triphenylcyclopropenium bromide to the thiocarbonyl complex [RhCl(CS)(PPh3)2] affords novel bicyclic metalla&#8208;3&#8208;mercapto&#8208;thiapyrylliums [Rh(&#954;2&#8208;C,S&#8208;C5S2Ph3)(PPh3)2X2] (X=Cl, Br) &#8211; heterocycles with no metal&#8208;free isolobal precedent. Halide abstraction with silver triflate (AgOTf) in acetonitrile affords the salt [Rh(&#954;2&#8208;C,S&#8208;C5S2Ph3)(NCMe)2(PPh3)2{Ag(OH2)2}{Ag(OTf)3}]&#8208;OTf which in turn reacts with sodium chloride to return [Rh(&#954;2&#8208;C,S&#8208;C5S2Ph3)(PPh3)2Cl2].

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Tropane Scaffolds by an Organocatalyzed 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition of 3&#8208;Oxidopyridinium Betaines and Dienamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 49, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organocatalyzed (5+2) cycloaddition of 3&#8208;oxidopyridinium betaines and dienamines is presented. The protocol allows for the enantioselective construction of functionalized tropane scaffolds in up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8201;ee and up to quantitative yield. DFT calculations propose a stepwise mechanism in which multiple cycloaddition pathways are possible, but the reversibility of diverging routes renders the reaction fully periselective.







Abstract
Tropane alkaloids constitute a compound&#8208;class which is structurally defined by a central 8&#8208;azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane core. A diverse bioactivity profile combined with an unusual aza&#8208;bridged bicyclic framework has made tropanes molecules&#8208;of&#8208;interest within organic chemistry. Enantioselective examples of (5+2) cycloadditions between 3&#8208;oxidopyridinium betaines and olefins remain unexplored, despite 3&#8208;oxidopyridinium betaines being useful reagents in organic synthesis. The first asymmetric (5+2) cycloaddition of 3&#8208;oxidopyridinium betaines is reported, affording tropane derivatives in up to quantitative yield and with excellent control of peri&#8208;, regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivity. The reactivity is enabled by dienamine&#8208;activation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes combined with in&#8197;situ formation of the pyridinium reaction&#8208;partner. A simple N&#8208;deprotection protocol allows for liberation of the tropane alkaloid motif, and synthetic elaborations of the cycloadducts demonstrate their synthetic utility to achieve highly diastereoselective modification around the bicyclic framework. DFT computations suggest a stepwise mechanism where regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity are defined during the first bond&#8208;forming step in which the pyridinium dipole exerts critical conformational control over its dienamine partner. In the second bond&#8208;forming step, a kinetic preference toward an initial (5+4) cycloadduct was identified; however, a lack of catalyst turn&#8208;over, reversibility, and thermodynamic bias favoring a (5+2) cycloadduct rendered the reaction fully periselective.

         <dc:description>
The reaction of an iridium tetrahydride (LIrH4, L=DippNacnac) with main&#8208;group (E=Sn, Pb, Bi) amides/alkoxides results in the extrusion of amines/alcohols with formation of iridium dimetallotetrylenes (LIrH)2(&#956;2&#8208;E)2. Computational investigations of the Ir2E2 (E=Sn, Pb) compounds characterized them as open&#8208;shell singlets; in contrast, Ir2Bi2 is characterized as having a closed&#8208;shell singlet ground state.







Abstract
Reactions of the IrV hydride [MeBDIDipp]IrH4 {BDI=(Dipp)NC(Me)CH(Me)CN(Dipp); Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3} with E[N(SiMe3)2]2 (E=Sn, Pb) afforded the unusual dimeric dimetallotetrylenes ([MeBDIDipp]IrH)2(&#956;2&#8208;E)2 in good yields. Moreover, ([MeBDIDipp]IrH)2(&#956;2&#8208;Ge)2 was formed in&#8197;situ from thermal decomposition of [MeBDIDipp]Ir(H)2Ge[N(SiMe3)2]2. These reactions are accompanied by liberation of HN(SiMe3)2 and H2 through the apparent cleavage of an E&#8722;N(SiMe3)2 bond by Ir&#8722;H. In a reversal of this process, ([MeBDIDipp]IrH)2(&#956;2&#8208;E)2 reacted with excess H2 to regenerate [MeBDIDipp]IrH4. Varying the concentrations of reactants led to formation of the trimeric ([MeBDIDipp]IrH2)3(&#956;2&#8208;E)3. The further scope of this synthetic route was investigated with group&#8197;15 amides, and ([MeBDIDipp]IrH)2(&#956;2&#8208;Bi)2 was prepared by the reaction of [MeBDIDipp]IrH4 with Bi(NMe2)3 or Bi(OtBu)3 to afford the first example of a &#8220;naked&#8221; two&#8208;coordinate Bi atom bound exclusively to transition metals. A viable mechanism that accounts for the formation of these products is proposed. Computational investigations of the Ir2E2 (E=Sn, Pb) compounds characterized them as open&#8208;shell singlets with confined nonbonding lone pairs at the E centers. In contrast, Ir2Bi2 is characterized as having a closed&#8208;shell singlet ground state.

&lt;p&gt;The reaction of an iridium tetrahydride (LIrH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, L=&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;Nacnac) with main-group (E=Sn, Pb, Bi) amides/alkoxides results in the extrusion of amines/alcohols with formation of iridium dimetallotetrylenes (LIrH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-E)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Computational investigations of the Ir&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (E=Sn, Pb) compounds characterized them as open-shell singlets; in contrast, Ir&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is characterized as having a closed-shell singlet ground state.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reactions of the Ir&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt; hydride [&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt;BDI&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;]IrH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; {BDI=(Dipp)NC(Me)CH(Me)CN(Dipp); Dipp=2,6-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;} with E[N(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (E=Sn, Pb) afforded the unusual dimeric dimetallotetrylenes ([&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt;BDI&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;]IrH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-E)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in good yields. Moreover, ([&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt;BDI&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;]IrH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Ge)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was formed in&#8197;situ from thermal decomposition of [&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt;BDI&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;]Ir(H)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ge[N(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. These reactions are accompanied by liberation of HN(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; through the apparent cleavage of an E&#8722;N(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; bond by Ir&#8722;H. In a reversal of this process, ([&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt;BDI&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;]IrH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-E)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reacted with excess H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to regenerate [&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt;BDI&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;]IrH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Varying the concentrations of reactants led to formation of the trimeric ([&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt;BDI&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;]IrH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-E)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The further scope of this synthetic route was investigated with group&#8197;15 amides, and ([&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt;BDI&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;]IrH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Bi)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was prepared by the reaction of [&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt;BDI&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;]IrH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with Bi(NMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or Bi(O&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to afford the first example of a &#8220;naked&#8221; two-coordinate Bi atom bound exclusively to transition metals. A viable mechanism that accounts for the formation of these products is proposed. Computational investigations of the Ir&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (E=Sn, Pb) compounds characterized them as open-shell singlets with confined nonbonding lone pairs at the E centers. In contrast, Ir&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is characterized as having a closed-shell singlet ground state.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>[(&#956;3&#8208;F)(BrF5)3]&#8722; &#8211; An Unprecedented Molecular Fluoridobromate(V) Anion in Cs[Br3F16]</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 49, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first fluoride&#8208;bridged oligonuclear Br(V) anion, [(&#956;3&#8208;F)(BrF5)3]&#8722;, has been obtained in the compound Cs[Br3F16]. The lone pairs on the Br atoms are shown to be stereochemically active, which has never been observed before for fluoridobromates(V) but only for fluoridoiodates(V).







Abstract
The reaction of Cs[BrF6] with BrF5 gave the compound Cs[Br3F16] with the unprecedented propeller&#8208;shaped, C3&#8208;symmetric [(&#956;3&#8208;F)(BrF5)3]&#8722; anion. All other currently known fluoridobromates(V) contain only octahedral [BrF6]&#8722; anions, which, unlike the related [IF6]&#8722; anions, never exhibited stereochemical activity of the lone pair on the Br atoms. Despite the same coordination number of six for the Br atom in the [BrF6]&#8722; and [(&#956;3&#8208;F)(BrF5)3]&#8722; anions, the longer &#956;3&#8208;F&#8722;Br bonds provide additional space, allowing the lone pairs on the Br atoms to become stereochemically active. Cs[Br3F16] was characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations for both the solid&#8208;state compound and the isolated anion at 0&#8197;K. Intrinsic bond orbital calculations show that the &#956;3&#8208;F&#8722;Br bond is essentially ionic in nature and also underpin the stereochemical activity of the lone pairs of the Br(V) atoms.

         <title>A Doubly Dissipative System Driven by Chemical and Radiative Stimuli</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 49, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The motions of an alkali cation from and to the crown&#8208;ether moieties of different ligands (up to three) is controlled over time and in a dissipative fashion by contextually employing two orthogonal stimuli, namely a radiative one and a chemical one. When the stimuli are no longer supplied, moving from out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium states, the system reversibly returns to its equilibrium state.







Abstract
The operation of a dissipative network composed of two or three different crown&#8208;ether receptors and an alkali metal cation can be temporally driven by the use (combined or not) of two orthogonal stimuli of a different nature. More specifically, irradiation with light at a proper wavelength and/or addition of an activated carboxylic acid, are used to modulate the binding capability of the above crown&#8208;ethers towards the metal ion, allowing to control over time the occupancy of the metal cation in the crown&#8208;ether moiety of a given ligand. Thus, application of either or both of the stimuli to an initially equilibrated system, where the metal cation is distributed among the crown&#8208;ether receptors depending on the different affinities, causes a programmable change in the receptor occupancies. Consequently, the system is induced to evolve to one or more out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium states with different distributions of the metal cation among the different receptors. When the fuel is exhausted or/and the irradiation interrupted, the system reversibly and autonomously goes back to the initial equilibrium state. Such results may contribute to the achievement of new dissipative systems that, taking advantage of multiple and orthogonal stimuli, are featured with more sophisticated operating mechanisms and time programmability.

Bare clusters of five Cu atoms, synthesized electrochemically, display remarkable oxidation stability on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite. They exhibit reversible O2 adsorption, transitioning between various Cu oxidation states with changes in temperature and O2 pressure. In&#8208;situ XPS and XANES spectroscopy experiments, along with theoretical characterizations of Cu5&#8211;(O2)n complexes, provide direct evidence of the Cu5 clusters&#8217; O2 stability. More information can be found in the Research Article by M.&#8197;P. de&#8197;Lara&#8208;Castells, F.&#8197;G. Requejo, M.&#8197;A.

         <title>Front Cover: Supramolecular Chirogenesis in a Sterically Hindered Porphyrin: A Critical Theoretical Analysis (Chem. Eur. J. 49/2023)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 49, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electronic circular dichroism (ECD) is widely used to determine chirality especially by employing porphyrins as reporter chromophores. The artwork, designed by Natalja Jemikova, shows a supramolecular complex of a porphyrin with two chiral guest molecules being irradiated to measure ECD and UV&#8208;Vis spectra. However, the electronic mechanism of induced ECD in the porphyrin has yet to be comprehensively rationalized, and computational chemistry can be successfully applied for this purpose. More information can be found in the Research Article by I. Osadchuk, M.&#8197;O. Senge and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301408).

         <dc:description>
Luminescent silver cluster&#8208;based coordination polymers composed of Ag10 or Ag12 cluster cores and multidentate pyridine linkers were synthesized as well as luminescent polymorphic silver(I)&#8208;based coordination polymers. It was found that these coordination polymers exhibit highly sensitive luminescence quenching effect to nitrobenzene, attributed to the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions between the polymers and nitrobenzene as well as the electron&#8208;withdrawing character of nitrobenzene. More information can be found in the Research Article by S.&#8197;Das, Prof. Y.&#8197;Negishi and co&#8208;workers. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300706).

         <title>Dual&#8208;Site Metal Catalysts for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 49, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic effect of bimetallic catalytic sites and recent developments of dual&#8208;site metal catalysts (DSMCs) in the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) are presented. This Review includes a description and generalization of the classification of DSMCs used for CO2RR according to the form of metal existence; a detailed analysis of the mechanisms and importance of synergy in enhancing electrocatalytic properties for CO2RR.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a promising and green approach for reducing atmospheric CO2 concentration and achieving high&#8208;valued conversion of CO2 under the carbon&#8208;neutral policy. In CO2RR, the dual&#8208;site metal catalysts (DSMCs) have received wide attention for their ingenious design strategies, abundant active sites, and excellent catalytic performance attributed to the synergistic effect between dual&#8208;site in terms of activity, selectivity and stability, which plays a key role in catalytic reactions. This review provides a systematic summary and detailed classification of DSMCs for CO2RR, describes the mechanism of synergistic effects in catalytic reactions, and also introduces in&#8197;situ characterization techniques commonly used in CO2RR. Finally, the main challenges and prospects of dual&#8208;site metal catalysts and even multi&#8208;site catalysts for CO2 recycling are analyzed. It is believed that based on the understanding of bimetallic site catalysts and synergistic effects in CO2RR, well&#8208;designed high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts are promising for achieving CO2 conversion, electrochemical energy conversion and storage in the future.

         <title>Recent Developments on Photochemical Synthesis of 1,n&#8208;Dicarbonyls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 49, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,n&#8208;dicarbonyls, having immense applications in the pharmaceutical industry owing to their fascinating attributes and biological activity, have been exploited as versatile building blocks in synthetic organic chemistry. The recent advancement on assembly of 1,n&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds via different photochemical modes of reaction has been documented in this review.







Abstract
1,n&#8208;dicarbonyls are one of the most fascinating chemical feedstocks finding abundant usage in the field of pharmaceuticals. Besides, they are utilized in a plethora of synthesis in general synthetic organic chemistry. A number of &#8216;conventional&#8217; methods are available for their synthesis, such as the Stetter reaction, Baker&#8208;Venkatraman rearrangement, oxidation of vicinal diols, and oxidation of deoxybenzoins, synonymous with unfriendly reagents and conditions. In the last 15&#8197;years or so, photocatalysis has taken the world of synthetic organic chemistry by a remarkable renaissance. It is fair to say now that everybody loves the light and photoredox chemistry has opened a new gateway to organic chemists towards milder, more simpler alternatives to the previously available methods, allowing access to many sensitive reactions and products. In this review, we present the readers with the photochemical synthesis of a variety of 1,n&#8208;dicarbonyls. Diverse photocatalytic pathways to these fascinating molecules have been discussed, placing special emphasis on the mechanisms, giving the reader an opportunity to find all these significant developments in one place.

         <dc:description>Enantiomerically pure acyclic O,O&#8208;acetal compounds (up to 97% ee) have been accessed through chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselective palladium&#8208;catalyzed addition of oximes to alkoxyallenes. DFT calculations support that a protonative hydropalladation pathway is favourable, in which the hydrogen bonding interaction between the amide group of the diphosphine ligand and the alkoxyallene is critical for the highly stereoselective formation of the dioxygenated stereogenic center.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Ring&#8208;Closing Alkyne&#8208;Carbonyl Metathesis for the Synthesis of Butenolides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkyne&#8208;carbonyl metathesis is a type of carbon&#8208;carbon forming reaction involving the construction a carbon&#8208;carbon double bond and a carbonyl group in one transformation. Herein, a Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;closing alkyne&#8208;carbonyl metathesis protocol has been developed to make densely substituted &#947;&#8208;butenolides from propargyl &#945;&#8208;ketoesters. It features 100% atom economy, excellent substrate flexibility and benign functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that the coordinative interaction between the gold catalyst and the alkyne might initiate the transfer of an oxygen atom and the formation of the carbon&#8208;carbon double bond. By using this gold&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;closing alkyne&#8208;carbonyl metathesis as a key step reaction, four naturally occurring butenolide&#8208;type compounds including decumbic acid (45% yield for 3 steps), deoxyisosporothric acid (32% yield for 5 steps), lichesterinic acid (34% yield for 5 steps) and isomuronic acid (6% yield for 8 steps) have been accessed starting from commercially available starting materials.</dc:description>

Profiting from inorganic modifications: The organic perylene structure was functionalized with inorganic silicon and germanium atoms. The broad absorption of the perylenes is represented by the hills in the background of the image, and the planar fused ring structure is illustrated by the leaves in the trees. The modified materials have beneficial properties for their application as electron acceptors in organic solar cells. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Haas, T.

         <dc:description>
Gas separation: A novel organic cage with excellent film&#8208;forming tendencies was processed into transparent, mechanically robust, self&#8208;standing membranes of controllable thickness. Thanks to their peculiar features, the membranes of the neat cage were successfully tested for gas permeation (e.g., with CO2), with behavior similar to that found with stiff glassy polymers such as polymers of intrinsic microporosity or polyimides being reported. More information can be found in the Research Article by J.&#8197;C. Jansen, V. Amendola and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301437).

         <title>In silico investigation of the thermochemistry and photoactivity of pyruvic acid in an aqueous solution of NaCl</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ab&#8197;initio study of the hydrated and non&#8208;hydrated forms of pyruvate in NaCl aqueous solution emphasizes the influence of sodium on the chemical equilibrium of hydration and photoactivity of the anion.







Abstract
The photochemistry of oxocarboxylic acids contributes significantly to the complex chemistry occurring in the atmosphere. In this regard, pyruvic acid undergoes photoreactions that lead to many diverse products. The presence of sodium cation near pyruvic acid in an aqueous solution, or its conjugate base in non&#8208;acidic conditions, influences the hydration equilibrium and the photosensitivity to UV&#8208;visible light of the oxocarboxylic acid. We performed an ab&#8197;initio metadynamics simulation which serves two purposes: first, it unveils the mechanisms of the reversible hydration reaction between the keto and the diol forms, with a free&#8208;energy difference of only 2&#8197;kJ/mol at 300&#8197;K, which shows the influence of sodium on the keto/diol ratio; second, it provides solvent&#8208;shared ion pairing (SSIP) and contact ion pairing (CIP) structures, including Na+ coordinated to carbonyl, for the calculations of the electronic transition energies to an antibonding &#960;* orbital, which sheds light on the photoactivity of these two forms in the actinic region.

         <title>Finding Order in Disorder: The Highly Disordered Lithium Oxonitridophosphate Double Salt Li8+xP3O10&#8722;xN1+x (x=1.4(5))</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li8+xP3O10&#8722;xN1+x is a lithium oxonitridophosphate double salt synthesized from P3N5 and Li2O in ampoule synthesis. The structure consists of phosphate and diphosphate motifs and exhibits a severe disorder in the diphosphate unit. NMR and vibrational spectroscopy methods give additional information concerning the composition of oxygen and nitrogen. Li8+xP3O10&#8722;xN1+x is a Li+ ion conductor with a total ionic conductivity of 1.2&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;S cm&#8722;1.







Abstract
The crystalline lithium oxonitridophosphate Li8+xP3O10&#8722;xN1+x, was obtained in an ampoule synthesis from P3N5 and Li2O. The compound crystallizes in the triclinic space group P
 with a=5.125(2), b=9.888(5), c=10.217(5) &#197;, &#945;=70.30(2), &#946;=76.65(2), &#947;=77.89(2)&#176;. Li8+xP3O10&#8722;xN1+x is a double salt, the structure of which contains distinctive complex anion species, namely non&#8208;condensed P(O,N)4 tetrahedra, and P(O,N)7 double tetrahedra connected by one N atom. Additionally, there is mixed occupation of O/N positions, which enables further anionic species by variation of O/N occupancies. To characterize these motifs in detail, complementary analytical methods were applied. The double tetrahedron exhibits significant disorder in single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Furthermore, the title compound is a Li+ ion conductor with a total ionic conductivity of 1.2&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;S cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C, and a corresponding total activation energy of 0.47(2) eV.

&lt;/sub&gt; is a double salt, the structure of which contains distinctive complex anion species, namely non-condensed P(O,N)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedra, and P(O,N)&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; double tetrahedra connected by one N atom. Additionally, there is mixed occupation of O/N positions, which enables further anionic species by variation of O/N occupancies. To characterize these motifs in detail, complementary analytical methods were applied. The double tetrahedron exhibits significant disorder in single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Furthermore, the title compound is a Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion conductor with a total ionic conductivity of 1.2&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;7&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 25&#8201;&#176;C, and a corresponding total activation energy of 0.47(2) eV.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unravelling the Mystery of COVID&#8208;19 Pathogenesis: Spike Protein and Cu Can Synergize to Trigger ROS Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How COVID&#8208;19 damage DNA: Severe oxidative damage to various biomolecules in COVID&#8208;19&#8208;infected lungs has been reported. Our study shows that SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein fragments coordinate Cu(II) ions, forming three&#8208;nitrogen complexes in the lung environment. Using various methods, we demonstrated that these complexes generate ROS, leading to single&#8208; and double&#8208;strand DNA breaks.







Abstract
The COVID&#8208;19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on global health, highlighting the need to understand how the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus damages the lungs in order to develop effective treatments. Recent research has shown that patients with COVID&#8208;19 experience severe oxidative damage to various biomolecules. We propose that the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection involves an interaction between copper ions and the virus&#8216;s spike protein. We tested two peptide fragments, Ac&#8208;ELDKYFKNH&#8208;NH2 (L1) and Ac&#8208;WSHPQFEK&#8208;NH2 (L2), derived from the spike protein of the Wuhan strain and the &#946; variant, respectively, and found that they bind Cu(II) ions and form a three&#8208;nitrogen complexes at lung pH. Our research demonstrates that these complexes trigger the overproduction of ROS, which can break both DNA strands and transform DNA into its linear form. Using A549&#8197;cells, we demonstrated that ROS overproduction occurs in the mitochondria, not in the cytoplasm. Our findings highlight the importance of the interaction between copper ions and the virus&#8216;s spike protein in the development of lung damage and may aid in the development of therapeutic procedures.

         <title>Base&#8208;Stabilized Phosphinidene Oxide, Imide and Sulfide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphinidene conducts an auction for the best P=X bond: Cyclic phosphinoamidinate&#8208;supported phosphinidene (NP)P is a natural precursor to base&#8208;stabilized PIII compounds (NP)P=X (X=O, NR, S). Interestingly, for the stronger P=O and P=N bonds, the respective compounds (NP)P=O and (NP)P=NTol are labile and cannot be isolated, but can be intercepted by isocyanate TolNCO to give the urea compound (NP)P&#8208;(NTol)2CO. In contrast, the sulfide (NP)P=S, prepared by a reaction of (NP)P with sulfur, is isolable. More information can be found in the Research Article by S.&#8197;F. Vyboishchikov, G.&#8197;I. Nikonov and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301842).

         <title>EPR Sensing of a Cation Species by Aza&#8208;Crown Ethers Incorporating a Persistent Nitroxidic Radical Unit</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and the use of aza&#8208;crown ethers containing a stable nitroxide acting as selective sensor of inorganic and organic cations is described. The radical is deeply involved in the coordination complex generating peculiar EPR spectral pattern also depending on non&#8208;zero nuclear spin of the metal cation. The wheel was employed also in the preparation of a rotaxane structure.







Abstract
New nitroxides based on aza&#8208;crown ethers were prepared and employed as selective sensors for the detection of inorganic and organic cations by EPR analysis of the corresponding host&#8211;guest complexes. The nitroxide unit behaves as a sensitive probe for a number of alkali and alkaline earth metal cations affording EPR spectra differing in the value of nitrogen hyperfine constants and in the appearance of splitted signals due to the non&#8208;zero nuclear spin of some metal cation upon complexation. Owing to the remarkable EPR spectral differences between the host and the corresponding cation complex the new macrocycles are likely to act as multitasking tools to recognize several cationic species. EPR behaviour of the larger nitroxide azacrown 1&#8901; when acting as a wheel in a radical synthetic bistable [2]rotaxane containing both secondary dialkylammonium and 1,2&#8208;bis(pyridinium) molecular stations, was also investigated. Reversible movements of the macrocycle between the two recognition sites in the rotaxane were promptly revealed by EPR, which shows significant changes either in nitrogen coupling constant values (aN) or in the spectral shape in the two rotaxane co&#8208;conformations.

         <title>Robust Biosensor Based on Carbon Nanotubes/Protein Hybrid Electrolyte Gated Transistors</title>

A robust sensor: A robust methodology for the fabrication of electrolyte&#8208;gated transistor biosensors is presented. Single walled carbon nanotubes are hybridized with bovine serum albumin allowing the transistor fabrication from aqueous solution. The sensor functionality is demonstrated for the detection of cortisol in solution after immobilization of antibodies on the gate surface. Analysis of the signal allows the extraction of binding parameters.







Abstract
Semiconducting single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are promising materials for biosensing applications with electrolyte&#8208;gated transistors (EGT). However, to be employed in EGT devices, SWCNTs often require lengthy solution&#8208;processing fabrication techniques. Here, we introduce a simple solution&#8208;based method that allows fabricating EGT devices from stable dispersions of SWCNTs/bovine serum albumin (BSA) hybrids in water. The dispersion is then deposited on a substrate allowing the formation of a SWCNTs random network as the semiconducting channel. We demonstrate that this methodology allows the fabrication of EGT devices with electric performances that allow their use in biosensing applications. We demonstrate their application for the detection of cortisol in solution, upon gate electrode functionalization with anti&#8208;cortisol antibodies. This is a robust and cost&#8208;effective methodology that sets the ground for a SWCNT/BSA&#8208;based biosensing platform that allows overcoming many limitations of standard SWCNTs biosensor fabrications.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two families of phosphorhydrazone dendrons having either an azide or an alkyne linked to the core and diverse types of pyridine derivatives as terminal functions have been synthesized and characterized. These dendrons were grafted via click reaction to graphene oxide (GO) functionalized with either alkyne or azide functions, respectively. The resulting modified&#8208;GO and GO&#8208;dendrons materials have been characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy (RS), and Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (MAS&#8208;NMR) analyses. In addition, the free dendrons and the dendrons grafted to GO were tested toward cancerous (HCT116) and non&#8208;cancerous (RPE1) cell lines.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Strategy for Increasing the Air&#8208;stability of Phosphines Including Primary Phosphines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given recent reports of structurally diverse air&#8208;stable primary phosphines lacking kinetic stabilization, the stability against oxidation was difficult to rationalize and attributed to the specific electronic nature of the phosphine group. This contribution shows the synthesis of a series of air&#8208;stable primary phosphines Fc(CH2)nPH2, where n = 0,1,2,3; and Fc = ferrocenyl, and their corresponding isolable primary phosphine oxides. It was demonstrated that the ferrocene moiety exerts an antioxidant effect on the primary phosphine group, which is intermolecular, solvent dependent and increases with the electron density on the ferrocene moiety. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the presence of ferrocene in solution also inhibits the oxidation of other secondary and tertiary phosphines in air. The collected information suggests that quenching of singlet oxygen is the actual reason for the antioxidant effect which was experimentally confirmed using other established singlet oxygen quenchers as well, demonstrating a key role of singlet oxygen in the aerobic oxidation of phosphines.</dc:description>

         <title>The Challenging World of Simple Inorganic Rings: Revisiting Roesky&#8217;s Ketone and Roesky&#8217;s Sulfoxide</title>

         <dc:description>The surprising differences between the experimental solid&#8208;state and calculated gas&#8208;phase structures of 5&#8208;oxo&#8208;1,3,2,4&#8208;dithiadiazole (Roesky&#8217;s ketone, 1) and 1&#8208;oxo&#8208;1,2,4,3,5&#8208;trithiadiazole (Roesky&#8217;s sulfoxide, 2), identified and studied in a series of papers published between 2004 and 2010 but then never satisfactorily explained, have been revisited, making use of the more advanced computational possibilities currently available. The previous calculations&#8217; considerable overestimations of the C&#8211;S and S&#8211;S bond lengths in 1 and 2, respectively, have been partly explained based on the results of periodic calculations and the application of Valence Bond (VB) Theory. In the case of 1, the crystal environment appears to stabilize a structure with a highly polarized C=O bond, which features a C&#8211;S bond with considerable double&#8208;bond character &#8211; an effect which does not exist for the isolated molecule &#8211; explaining the much shorter bond in the solid state. For 2, a similar conclusion can be drawn for the S&#8211;S distance. For both compounds, though, packing effects are not the sole source of the differences: the inability of Density Functional Theory (DFT) to properly deal with the electronic structures of these apparently simple main&#8208;group systems remains a contributing factor.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing the Cycle Performance of Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries by Coating the Separator with a Cation&#8208;Selective Polymer Layer&#160;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries are believed to possess the feasibility to power electric vehicles in the future ascribed to the competitive energy density. However, soluble polysulfides continuously shuttle between the sulfur electrode and lithium anode across the separator, which dramatically impairs the battery&#8217;s capacity. Herein, the surface of a polypropylene separator (PP film) is successfully modified with a delicately designed cation&#8208;selective polymer layer to suppress the transport of polysulfides. In principle, since bis&#8208;sulfonimide anions groups on the backbone of the polymer are immobilized, only cations can pass through the polymer layer. Furthermore, plenty of ethoxy chains in the polymer can facilitate lithium&#8208;ion mobility. Consequently, in addition to obstructing the movement of negatively charged polysulfides by the electrostatic repulsive force of fixed anions, the coated multi&#8208;functional layer on the PP film also guarantees the smooth conduction of lithium ions. The investigations demonstrate that the battery with the pristine PP film only delivers 228.5 mAh g&#8208;1 after 300 cycles at 2 C with a high capacity fading rate of 60.9%. By contrast, the polymer&#8208;coated sample can release 409.4 mAh g&#8208;1 under the identical test condition and the capacity fading rate sharply declines to 43.2%, illustrating superior cycle performance.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The synthesis and first structural characterization of the [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)] bismolyl Bitet (C4Me4Bi) contact ion pair 1 is presented. Notably, according to Natural Resonance Theory calculations, the Bitet anion of 1 features two types of leading mesomeric structures with localized anionic charge and two lone pairs of electrons at the Bi(I) center, and delocalized anionic charge in the &#960;&#8208;conjugated C4Bi ring. The lone pairs at Bi enable a unique bridging coordination mode of the bismolyl ligand as shown for the first rare earth metal bismolyl complex (Cptet2Y)2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;1&#8208;Bitet)22. The latter results from salt metathesis reaction of KBitet with Cptet2Y(BPh4) (Cptet = C5Me4H). The Y&#8211;Bi bonding interaction in 2 of 16.6% covalency at yttrium is remarkably large.</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of Truncation on Optoelectronic Properties of Azaborole Helicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report configurationally stable singly&#8208;truncated (ST) and structurally flexible doubly&#8208;truncated (DT) helically chiral compounds derived from azabora[7]helicenes by a hypothetical removal of a single or two C=C double bonds. The singly&#8208;truncated constitutional isomers were synthesized from either benzoisoquinoline (BIQ) or phenantherene building blocks and the corresponding biaryls in excellent yields to give azabora[5]helicenes with a pendant phenyl ring at a sterically hindered position. These systems highlight the electronic impact of the nitrogen donor substitution position. The compounds with a disrupted BIQ moiety (STN) possess remarkable photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 0.53 in the solid state and a blue emission in solution with dissymmetry factors of up to ca. 3 &#215; 10&#8211;3. Upon cooling to 79 K all compounds exhibit phosphorescence with lifetimes of up to ca. 0.5 s. A methyl complex of azabora[7]helicene showing excellent configurational stability was used as a chiral inducer embedded in an emissive polymer (F8BT) to produce circularly polarized organic light emitting diodes with an electroluminescence dissymmetry factor gEL of up to 0.54.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Binding of Hydrogen and Styrene Coordination on a Manganese Phosphenium Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactions of two complexes [(RNHP)Mn(CO)4] (RNHP = N&#8208;arylated N&#8208;heterocyclic phosphenium) with H2 at elevated pressure (&#8776; 4 bar) were studied by NMR spectroscopy. Irradiation with UV light initialized in one case (5a, R = Dipp) the unselective formation of (RNHP&#8208;H)MnH(CO)4] (6a) via cooperative addition of H2 across the Mn=P double bond. In the other case (5b, R = Mes), addition of H2 was unobservable and the reaction proceeded via decarbonylation to a dimeric species [(RNHP)2Mn2(CO)7] (7b) that was isolated and identified spectroscopically. Taking into account the outcome of further reaction studies under various conditions in the absence and presence of H2, both transformations can be explained in the context of a common mechanism involving decarbonylation to 7a,b as the first step, and the different outcome is attributable to the fact that 7b is unreactive towards both H2 and CO while 7a is not. DFT studies relate this divergence to deviations in the molecular constitution and stability arising from a different level of steric congestion. Preliminary studies suggest further that 5a/H2 as well as 6a enable the photo&#8208;induced hydrogenation of styrene to ethyl benzene, even if the mechanism and possibly catalytic nature of this process remain yet unknown.</dc:description>

         <title>Graphitic Carbon Nitride as Photocatalyst for the Direct Formylation of Anilines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new metal&#8208;free photocatalytic approach for the direct conversion of N,N&#8208;difunctionalized anilines into formamides derivatives (up to 89&#8201;% yield) under mild operative conditions is described herein. In this reaction, graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;CN) acts as a robust and fully recyclable visible&#8208;light photocatalyst that was easily recovered and reused up to five times without any significant drop in yield.







Abstract
The use of graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;CN) for the photocatalytic radical formylation of anilines, which represents a more sustainable and attractive alternative to the currently used approaches, is reported herein. Our operationally simple method occurs under mild conditions, employing air as an oxidant. In particular, the chemistry is driven by the ability of g&#8208;CN to reach an electronically excited state upon visible&#8208;light absorption, which has a suitable potential energy to trigger the formation of reactive &#945;&#8208;amino radical species from anilines. Mechanistic investigations also proved the key role of the g&#8208;CN to form reactive superoxide radicals from O2 via single electron transfer. Importantly, this photocatalytic transformation provides a variety of functionalized formamides (15 examples, up to 89&#8201;% yield).

         <title>Hydrogen Bonded Dimer of an Alcohol with the Derived Carboxylic acid Triggering their Sorption by Nanoporous&#8208;crystalline PPO Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(2,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;phenylene) oxide (PPO) films do not absorb benzyl alcohol (BAL) and benzoic acid (BA) separately from dilute aqueous solutions while exhibiting selective uptake of a BAL/BA equimolar compound, if BA is obtained by oxidizing BAL. Quantitative FTIR evaluations and structural information indicate uptake of a BAL/BA hydrogen&#8208;bonded dimer in PPO intrahelical crystalline channels.







Abstract
Films exhibiting nanoporous&#8208;crystalline (NC) phases of poly(2,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;phenylene) oxide (PPO), which are highly effective to absorb apolar organic guest molecules, are also able to absorb polar molecules (like alcohols and carboxylic acids) but only from concentrated organic solutions. NC PPO films, which do not absorb alcohols and carboxylic acids from diluted aqueous solutions, exhibits a huge uptake (even above 30&#8197;wt&#8201;%) of benzyl alcohol (BAL) and benzoic acid (BA), if BA is obtained by spontaneous room temperature oxidation of BAL in aqueous solution. This phenomenon is rationalized by an easy uptake, mainly by the PPO intrahelical crystalline empty channels, of a BAL/BA 1/1 hydrogen&#8208;bonded dimer. This huge uptake of BAL/BA dimer by NC PPO films, which is also fast for films exhibiting the orientation of the crystalline helices perpendicular to the film plane (c&#8869; orientation), can be exploited for purification of water from BAL, when present in traces. High and fast sorption of a hydrogen bonded dimer and negligible sorption of the two separate compounds is possibly unprecedented for absorbent materials.

Four novel types of complicated penta&#8208;spiro/fused&#8208;heterocyclic frameworks based on an indazolone scaffold have been constructed by C&#8722;H activation/[4+1] and [4+2] annulation cascades. The novel spiro[cyclohexane&#8208;indazolo[1,2&#8208;a]indazole] framework constructed by this method exhibited potent antitumor activity against a variety of refractory solid tumors and hematological malignancies.

         <title>Chiral TPE Foldamers in Macrocycles: Aggregation Enhanced Emission and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral macrocycles with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) have attracted increasing attention due to the rigid structure, symmetrical chiral geometry and large luminescence dissymmetry factors (glum). &#160;However, most chiral macrocycles are more emissive in solutions but have weakened fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;F) in aggregates, limiting their further application. In this paper, chiral macrocycle R/S&#8208;PhTPE was synthesized by combining chiral macrocycle architectonics with Z&#8208;o&#8208;phenyltetraphenylethylene (PhTPE) foldamer. Enhanced solution state emission and characteristic aggregation enhanced emission (AEE) effect can be observed for R/S&#8208;PhTPE due to the folded PhTPE conformation. Macrocycle immobilization and folded conformation endow PhTPE moiety with stable helical conformation. Most importantly, R/S&#8208;PhTPE exhibits opposite CPL signals compared with common chiral TPEs, demonstrating the evident impact of folded conformation. This work reports the first and deep insights into the chiroptical properties of chiral PhTPE foldamers, and will provide a new strategy to tune &#1060;F and CPL signals of AIE active chiral macrocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Improved Triplex&#8208;Forming Isoorotamide PNA Nucleobases for A&#8208;U Recognition of RNA Duplexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four new isoorotamide (Io) containing PNA nucleobases were designed for A&#8208;U recognition of double helical RNA. New PNA monomers were prepared efficiently and incorporated into PNA 9&#8208;mers for binding A&#8208;U in a PNA:RNA2 triplex. Isothermal titration calorimetry and UV thermal melting experiments revealed slightly improved binding affinity for singly&#8208;modified PNA compared to known A&#8208;binding nucleobases. Molecular dynamics simulations provided further insights into binding of Io bases in the triple helix. Together, data revealed interesting insights into binding modes including the notion that three Hoogsteen&#8208;hydrogen bonds are unnecessary for strong selective binding of an extended nucleobase. Cationic monomer Io8 additionally gave the highest affinity observed for an A&#8208;binding nucleobase to date. These results will help inform future nucleobase design toward the goal of recognizing any sequence of double helical RNA.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Hydrolysable Analogues of Cyclic and Branched Condensed Phosphates: Chemistry and Chemical Proteomics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Studies into the biology of condensed phosphates almost exclusively cover linear polyphosphates. However, there is evidence for the presence of cyclic polyphosphates (metaphosphates) in organisms and for enzymatic digestion of branched phosphates (ultraphosphates) with alkaline phosphatase. Further research of non&#8208;linear condensed phosphates in biology would profit from interactome data of such molecules, however, their stability in biological media is limited. Here we present syntheses of modified, non&#8208;hydrolysable analogues of cyclic and branched condensed phosphates, called meta&#8208; and ultraphosphonates, and their application in a chemical proteomics approach using yeast cell extracts. We identify putative interactors with overlapping hits for structurally related capture compounds underlining the quality of our results. The datasets serve as starting point to study the biological relevance and functions of meta&#8208; and ultraphosphates. In addition, we examine the reactivity of meta&#8208; and ultraphosphonates with implications for their &#8220;hydrolysable&#8221; analogues: Efforts to increase the ring&#8208;sizes of meta&#8208; or cyclic ultraphosphonates revealed a strong preference to form trimetaphosphate&#8208;analogue structures by cyclization and/or ring&#8208;contraction. Using carbodiimides for condensation, the so far inaccessible dianhydro product of ultraphosphonate, corresponding to P4O112&#8722;, was selectively obtained and then ring&#8208;opened by different nucleophiles yielding modified cyclic ultraphosphonates.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A mild, practical, and environmentally friendly method for the hydrodecarboxylation of fatty acids using an acridine&#8208;based photoredox catalyst and thiophenol was developed. Cn&#8208;1 alkanes were synthesized in good to excellent yields (up to 99%) from C9&#8208;C18 saturated fatty acids under visible light irradiation (405 nm). The developed protocol was employed for a mixture of fatty acids obtained from the hydrolysis of Licuri oil, affording a mixture of C9&#8208;C17 hydrocarbons in quantitative yield, which demonstrates the potential application of the method to produce drop&#8208;in biofuels.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The combination of Lewis bases with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls allows the in situ generation of enolates without the need for strong Br&#248;nsted bases. Recently developed synthetic methods employ this approach for arylation followed by elimination of the Lewis base, regenerating the alkene. This strategy has been deployed for formal &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;C&#8211;H arylation in different contexts, namely (a) transition metal catalysis, (b) rearrangement reactions utilizing hypervalent main group elements and (c) organocatalysis.

         <dc:description>The formation of Lewis pairs is an important chemical concept. Recently, the complexation of Lewis acidic tris(pentafluorophenyl)&#8208;borane with Lewis basic moieties and subsequent reduction has emerged as a fascinating strategy for designing novel reactions and structures. The impact of the complexation and subsequent reduction of antiaromatic systems bearing Lewis basic moieties has been investigated.

         <title>Dispersing LiCl in Zwitterionic COF for Highly Efficient Ammonia Storage and Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient and inherently safe NH3 storage and separation are of significant importance for chemical industry. Herein, we proposed zwitterionic COF as porous host to disperse LiCl for highly efficient NH3 storage and separation with record adsorption capacity. The equivalently cationic and anionic groups in the channels of zwitterionic COF could act as two separated sites to facilitate the dispersion of LiCl, hence the optimal composite exhibits a high capture capacity of 44.98 mmol/g at 25&#176;C and 1 bar, far exceeding other existing porous materials. Notably, the adsorption capacity is completely reversible and the efficient separation of NH3 from NH3/CO2/N2 mixture is achieved through breakthrough experiments. DFT calculation combined with XPS and 7Li NMR experimental results give insight into the interaction between zwitterionic COF and LiCl. This work extends possibilities for the development of efficient adsorbents for NH3 storage and separation.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioinspired Non&#8208;Heme Mn Catalysts for Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Oxyfunctionalizations with H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, metalloenzymes&#8208;mediated highly selective oxidations of organic substrates under mild conditions have been inspiration for developing synthetic bioinspired catalyst systems, capable of conducting such processes in the laboratory (and, in the future, in industry), relying on easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle and environmentally benign oxidants such as H2O2. To date, non&#8208;heme manganese complexes with chiral bis&#8208;amino&#8208;bis&#8208;pyridylmethyl and structurally related ligands are considered as possessing the highest synthetic potential, having demonstrated the ability to mediate a variety of chemo&#8208; and stereoselective oxidative transformations, such as epoxidations, C(sp3)&#8210;H hydroxylations and ketonizations, oxidative desymmetrizations, kinetic resolutions, etc. Furthermore, in the past few years non&#8208;heme Mn based catalysts have become the major platform for studies focused on getting insight into the molecular mechanisms of oxidant activation and (stereo)selective oxygen transfer, testing non&#8208;traditional hydroperoxide oxidants, engineering catalytic sites with enzyme&#8208;like substrate recognition&#8208;based selectivity, exploration of catalytic regioselectivity trends in the oxidation of biologically active substrates of natural origin. This contribution summarizes the progress in manganese catalyzed C&#8210;H oxygenative transformations of organic substrates, achieved essentially in the past 5 years (late 2018&#8210;2023).</dc:description>

         <title>Photolysis of an Archetypal Model Complex. Photooxidation Versus Photoreduction of Azido(porphinato)iron(III)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photolysis: The yield and product distribution of the photolysis of the archetypal azidoporphinatoiron(III) complex are examined by stationary and transient IR spectroscopy in conjunction with chemical quenching reactions with iodide and an isonitrile. The complex decomposes almost equally to the Fe(II) and the nitrido&#8208;Fe(V) product, with small absolute yields. Moreover, subsequent bimolecular reactions of the products are considered.







Abstract
Azidoporphinatoiron(III) ([1]) is an archetypal model complex for the photochemical generation of nitridoiron(V) complexes via cleavage of dinitrogen. So far, this process has only been studied with continuous irradiation in thin films under cryogenic conditions or in frozen solutions. In addition, the photooxidation from iron(III) to iron(V) competes with photoreduction to iron(II) via cleavage of an azidyl radical. The quantum yields of both pathways remained hitherto undisclosed. Here, we investigated the photolysis of this model complex in room temperature liquid solution using stationary and time&#8208;resolved infrared spectroscopy. The two reaction pathways are unambiguously identified in quenching studies and their quantum yields are accurately determined. Nitridoporphinatoiron(V) ([2]) exhibits N&#8208;atom&#8208;2&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer reactivity toward tert&#8208;butyl isonitrile and forms a carbodiimido species.

     alt="Photolysis of an Archetypal Model Complex. Photooxidation Versus Photoreduction of Azido(porphinato)iron(III)"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Photolysis&lt;/b&gt;: The yield and product distribution of the photolysis of the archetypal azidoporphinatoiron(III) complex are examined by stationary and transient IR spectroscopy in conjunction with chemical quenching reactions with iodide and an isonitrile. The complex decomposes almost equally to the Fe(II) and the nitrido-Fe(V) product, with small absolute yields. Moreover, subsequent bimolecular reactions of the products are considered.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azidoporphinatoiron(III) ([&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;]) is an archetypal model complex for the photochemical generation of nitridoiron(V) complexes via cleavage of dinitrogen. So far, this process has only been studied with continuous irradiation in thin films under cryogenic conditions or in frozen solutions. In addition, the photooxidation from iron(III) to iron(V) competes with photoreduction to iron(II) via cleavage of an azidyl radical. The quantum yields of both pathways remained hitherto undisclosed. Here, we investigated the photolysis of this model complex in room temperature liquid solution using stationary and time-resolved infrared spectroscopy. The two reaction pathways are unambiguously identified in quenching studies and their quantum yields are accurately determined. Nitridoporphinatoiron(V) ([&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;]) exhibits N-atom-2-electron-transfer reactivity toward &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl isonitrile and forms a carbodiimido species. In the presence of &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl isonitrile, the two products of the photoreduction pathway react to cationic diisonitriloporphinatoiron(III) and azide anions, which in turn combine to reform [&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;] and the quencher.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tuneable plasmonic resonances of a dynamic thin film of ultrasmall nanocrystals modified in the anti&#8208;galvanic reduction process.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (NPs) have revolutionized nanotechnology as they are an excellent starting substrate for the synthesis of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials with photonic or energy conversion applications, often with a responsive nature. However, ultrasmall NPs do not sustain plasmonic resonances, preventing their use in plasmon&#8208;related applications. In the presented work, we show a method of chemical modification of ultrasmall gold nanoparticles in order to fabricate dynamically controlled plasmonic thin films. For this purpose, we used the Anti&#8208;Galvanic Reduction process (AGR) to modify the surface of small gold nanoparticles, inducing plasmonic properties without notable size increases. Au@Ag NPs are then modified with liquid crystal&#8208;like organic ligands. The obtained NPs can assemble into densely packed films with long&#8208;range order and temperature&#8208;dependent structural properties. Namely, we detect two, fully reversible phase transitions between the hexagonal and cubic symmetries. The combination of AGR and organic surface modifications enabled us to demonstrate the possibility of managing plasmonic properties in the thin film of ~2 nm diameter metallic NPs.</dc:description>

         <title>The Structure of Maneb, An Important Manganese&#8208;Containing Bis(dithiocarbamate) Fungicide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular structure of Maneb determined: Over 70&#8197;years after patent publication, the mystery of the structure of the surprisingly stable manganese(II)&#8208;containing ethylene bis(dithiocarbamate) fungicide, which is extensively used in agriculture, has finally been solved.







Abstract
Maneb is a manganese(II)&#8208;containing fungicide with a multi&#8208;site effect and no resistance, therefore it is widely applied in many parts of the world. There is, however, mounting evidence for neurotoxic effects with Parkinson&#8208;like symptoms (manganism) related to usage of Maneb. Due to its insolubility in most solvents and its paramagnetism, structural elucidation is not trivial, and thus its exact molecular structure remains unknown. We report herein a synthesis procedure to prepare Maneb reproducibly in pure form and the use of various analytical techniques including X&#8208;ray diffraction, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and electron diffraction to determine the molecular structure of Maneb in the solid state and also in solution.

         <title>Straightforward Synthesis of Halopyridine Aldehydes via Diaminomethylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridines featuring two or more halogen atoms react with silylformamidine via insertion into the most acidic C&#8722;H bond either at the &#947; or &#946;&#8208;positions affording the corresponding aminals. Their hydrolysis gave aldehydes. The reaction proceeds via H&#8208;abstraction from pyridines by the strong base&#8208;carbenic form of silylformamidine followed by formation of C&#8722;C bond between the formamidinium cation and the pyridine anion.







Abstract
A novel two&#8208;step method for formylation of fluoropyridines with silylformamidine Me3SiC(=NMe)NMe2 (1) under catalyst&#8208;free conditions was developed. A series of all possible 18&#8197;fluoropyridines featuring one to four fluorine atoms were subjected to the reaction with 1 existing in equilibrium with its carbenic form Me2NC(:)N(Me)SiMe3 (1&#8242;). Among them, 12&#8197;fluoropyridines were shown to react via C&#8722;H insertion. The reaction proceeded either at &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;positions affording the corresponding aminals. The more fluorine atoms in pyridines, the easier the reaction proceeded. We also hypothesized that the pyridines in which the fluorine was substituted by other halogens would react in a similar manner. To test the hypothesis, a set of 3,5&#8208;disubstituted pyridines with various combination of halogen atoms was prepared. 3,5&#8208;Difluoropyridine was taken as a compound for comparison. All the pyridines in the series also reacted likewise. In most cases, hydrolysis of the aminals afforded the corresponding aldehydes. As DFT calculations indicate, the reaction mechanism includes deprotonation of pyridine by 1&#8242; as a strong base and the following rearrangement of the formed tight ionic pair to the final product. An alternative reaction pathway involving addition of 1&#8242; to the pyridine carbon with the following hydrogen transfer via a three&#8208;membered transition state structure required much higher activation energy.

         <title>Heterocyclic Merging of Stereochemically Diverse Chiral Piperazines and Morpholines with Indazoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present study accomplishes the heterocyclic merging of piperazines and morpholines with indazoles, successfully produced 20 distinct regio and stereochemically diverse indazolo&#8208;piperazine and indazolo&#8208;morpholine derivatives. This process could possibly be expanded to provide an efficient synthetic route that allows stereochemical and regiochemical variation in the assembly. We hypothesize that merging will afford compounds with biological activities that are unique from those of the simpler scaffolds that make up their merged structure.&gt;







Abstract
We report a heterocyclic merging approach to construct novel indazolo&#8208;piperazines and indazolo&#8208;morpholines. Starting from chiral diamines and amino alcohols, novel regiochemically (1,3 and 1,4) and stereochemically diverse (relative and absolute) cohorts of indazolo&#8208;piperazines and indazolo&#8208;morpholines were obtained within six or seven steps. The key transformations involved are a Smiles rearrangement to generate the indazole core structure and a late&#8208;stage Michael addition to build the piperazine and morpholine heterocycles. We further explored additional vector diversity by incorporating substitutions on the indazole aromatic ring, generating a total of 20 unique, enantiomerically pure heterocyclic scaffolds.

         <title>Highly Efficient Electrochemiluminescence from Imidazole&#8208;Based Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of imidazole&#8208;based thermally activated delayed fluorescent emitters have been synthesized and characterized. The electrochemiluminescence efficiency of such compounds is dictated by the presence of electrochemical reversible redox processes rather than by their photophysical properties in terms of photoluminescence quantum yields and excited&#8208;state lifetimes. Moreover, the imidazole moiety can be alkylated enabling the insertion of a derivatizable group.







Abstract
A family of novel thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters has been synthesized by a straightforward and metal&#8208;free synthesis, and structurally characterized. In this work we kept the acceptor moiety, 4&#8208;(1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)benzonitrile, fixed and systemically tested different donors to correlate their photophysical and electrochemical properties with their performance in electrochemiluminescence using both benzoyl peroxide as co&#8208;reactant and co&#8208;reactant free (annihilation) conditions. Some compounds exceeded the efficiency of the standard [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 by up to 28&#8197;times with benzoyl peroxide and 38&#8197;times in annihilation. Interestingly, we found that the efficiency is mainly dictated by the electrochemical reversibility of the redox processes rather than by the photophysical properties in terms of photoluminescence quantum yields or excited&#8208;state lifetime. In addition, the annihilation electrochemiluminescence efficiency strongly depends on the pulse sequence. The imidazole moiety can be conveniently alkylated, thus allowing the insertion of functional groups, such a carboxylic acid, and enabling practical applications.

In this work we kept the acceptor moiety, 4-(1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-imidazol-1-yl)benzonitrile, fixed and systemically tested different donors to correlate their photophysical and electrochemical properties with their performance in electrochemiluminescence using both benzoyl peroxide as co-reactant and co-reactant free (annihilation) conditions. Some compounds exceeded the efficiency of the standard [Ru(bpy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by up to 28&#8197;times with benzoyl peroxide and 38&#8197;times in annihilation. Interestingly, we found that the efficiency is mainly dictated by the electrochemical reversibility of the redox processes rather than by the photophysical properties in terms of photoluminescence quantum yields or excited-state lifetime. In addition, the annihilation electrochemiluminescence efficiency strongly depends on the pulse sequence. The imidazole moiety can be conveniently alkylated, thus allowing the insertion of functional groups, such a carboxylic acid, and enabling practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Acid&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Amide Supramolecular Synthon for Tuning Amino Acid&#8208;Based Hydrogels&#8217; Properties</title>

The self&#8208;assembly of the well&#8208;known efficient gelator N&#8208;Fmoc&#8208;l&#8208;pentafluoro&#8208;phenylalanine, in the presence of a strong hydrogen bond&#8208;forming non&#8208;gelator, like benzamide, is driven by the same supramolecular interactions both in the crystal and hydrogel phase. This matching could open the way to a crystal engineering&#8208;based approach for the design of multicomponent amino acid hydrogels with tunable strength and properties.







Abstract
Supramolecular hydrogels formed by the self&#8208;assembly of N&#8208;Fmoc&#8208;l&#8208;phenylalanine derivatives are gaining relevance for several applications in the materials and biomedical fields. In the challenging attempt to predict or tune their properties, we selected Fmoc&#8208;pentafluorophenylalanine (1) as a model efficient gelator, and studied its self&#8208;assembly in the presence of benzamide (2), a non&#8208;gelator able to form strong hydrogen bonds with the amino acid carboxylic group. Equimolar mixtures of 1 and 2 in organic solvents afforded a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 co&#8208;crystal thanks to the formation of an acid&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;amide heterodimeric supramolecular synthon. The same synthon occurred in the transparent gels formed by mixing the two components in 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio in aqueous media, as revealed by structural, spectroscopic, and thermal characterizations performed on both the co&#8208;crystal powder and the lyophilized hydrogel. These findings revealed the possibility of modulating the properties of amino acid&#8208;based hydrogels by involving the gelator in the formation of a co&#8208;crystal. Such a crystal engineering&#8208;based approach is shown also to be useful for the time&#8208;delayed release of suitable bioactive molecules, when involved as hydrogel coformers.

         <title>Sheltering Mono&#8208;P&#8208;Ligated Metal Complexes in Porous Polystyrene Monolith: Effect of Aryl Pendant Stabilizers on Catalytic Durability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mono&#8208;ligated phosphine&#8208;metal complexes on porous polystyrene monoliths exhibited high catalytic durabilities by screening the electronic properties of aryl pendant groups. The quantitative analyses of interactions between aryl pendant groups and metal center revealed the importance of moderate stabilization for long&#8208;term catalysis in continuous&#8208;flow cross&#8208;couplings.







Abstract
Metal centers that can generate coordinatively unsaturated metals in accessible and stable states have been developed using synthetic polymers with sophisticated ligand and scaffold designs, which required synthetic efforts. Herein, we report a simple and direct strategy for producing polymer&#8208;supported phosphine&#8208;metal complexes, which stabilizes mono&#8208;P&#8208;ligated metals by modulating the electronic properties of the aryl pendant groups in the polymer platform. A three&#8208;fold vinylated PPh3 was copolymerized with a styrene derivative and a cross&#8208;linker to produce a porous polystyrene&#8208;phosphine hybrid monolith. Based on the Hammett substituent constants, the electronic properties of styrene derivatives were modulated and incorporated into the polystyrene backbone to stabilize the mono&#8208;P&#8208;ligated Pd complex via Pd&#8208;arene interactions. Through NMR, TEM, and comparative catalytic studies, the polystyrene&#8208;phosphine hybrid, which induces selective mono&#8208;P&#8208;ligation and moderate Pd&#8208;arene interactions, demonstrated high catalytic durability for the cross&#8208;coupling of chloroarenes under continuous&#8208;flow conditions.

         <title>Improved catalytic performance toward selective oxidation of benzyl alcohols originated from new open&#8208;framework copper molybdovanadate with a unique V/Mo ratio</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid open&#8208;framework molybdovanadate with mixed&#8208;valences of vanadium (V4+/V5+ =4/3) and molybdenum (Mo5+/Mo6+ =8/2) cations has been synthesized for the first time. The complex possesses the unique V/Mo ratio (7/10), fascinating 8&#8208;C topological network and 1D 4&#8208;MR channels (7.793 &#197; &#215; 6.699 &#197;). Importantly, its catalytic activities for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde (oxidant: H2O2, wt % = 30 %) have been well evaluated. The results indicated that it exhibited improved catalytic activities (conv.: 96.8 %) compared with the catalyst (Cpyr)5PV2Mo5W5O40 [Conv.: 88.51 %, Cpyr = (C16H32C5H4N)+)], high recyclability and structural stability. Moreover, the conversions and selectivities (Conv.: 82.4&#8208;92.5 %; Sele.: 91.5&#8208;95.7 %) of the substrates containing electron donating groups (&#8208;OH, &#8208;CH3, &#8208;OCH3 and &#8208;Cl) were significantly higher than those of the substrate containing electron withdrawing group (&#8208;NO2) (Conv. 67.4 %; Sele. 80.8 %). This is due to the fact that the &#8208;NO2 with a large Hammett substituent constant (&#963;) is not conducive to the generation of transition state products. The studies revealed the complex could act as a highly efficient heterogeneous catalyst in selective oxidation of benzyl alcohols.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidative Addition and &#946;&#8208;hydride Elimination by a Macrocyclic Dinickel Complex: Observing Bimetallic Elementary Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dinickel(I) complex Ni2(tBuPONNOPONNO), featuring a planar macrocyclic diphosphoranide ligand tBuPONNOPONNO, offers a unique architectural platform for observing bimetallic elementary reactions. Oxidative addition reactions of alkyl halides produce dinickel(II) complexes of the type Ni2(&#956;&#8208;R)(&#956;&#8208;X)(tBuPONNOPONNO). However, when R = Et &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination is observed to form a dinickel monohydride, with the rate dependent on the nature of X. DFT studies suggest a new mechanism for bimetallic &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination, where the rate dependence arises from the steric pressure imposed by the X group on the opposing trans face of the dinickel macrocycle. This work enhances understanding of bimetallic elementary reactions, particularly &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination, which have not been well&#8208;explored for dinuclear systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion&#8208;Dependent Reactivity of Mono&#8208; and Dinuclear Boron Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dinuclear bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) borane adduct 2 rapidly reacts with tritylium salts at room temperature but the outcome is strongly impacted by the respective counter&#8208;ion. Using tritylium tetrakis(perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butoxy)aluminate affords &#8211; depending on the solvent &#8211; either the bis(boronium) ion 4 or the hydride&#8208;bridged dication 5. In case of tritylium hexafluorophosphate, however, H/F exchange occurs between boron and phosphorus yielding the dinuclear BF3 adduct 3 along with phosphorus dihydride trifluoride. H/F exchange also takes place when using the mononuclear N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene BH3 adduct 6 and hence provides a facile route to PH2F3, which is usually synthesized in more complex reaction sequences regularly involving toxic hydrogen fluoride. DFT calculations shed light on the H/F exchange between the borenium ion and the [PF6]&#8208; counter&#8208;ion and the computed mechanism features only small barriers in line with the experimental observations.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Doping heteroatoms into polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) may alter their structures and thereby physical properties. Herein, we report the construction of B/N&#8208;codoped PAHs via combining the B&#8208; and N&#8208;doped &#960;&#8208;systems. Two &#960;&#8208;extended B/N&#8208;codoped PAHs were synthesized through the Mallory photoreaction. Both of them feature a C48BN2 &#960;&#8208;skeleton, which is assembled by linearly fusing three substructures including B&#8208;doped and sp2&#8208;hybridized N&#8208;doped &#960;&#8208;moieties and one pyrene unit. In comparison to the pristine B&#8208;doped analog, their intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) states are distinctly modulated by the fused N&#8208;doped &#960;&#8208;system and the further incorporated cyano group, leading to their tunable optical properties, as revealed by detailed theoretical and experimental analysis. Furthermore, these three molecules have sufficient Lewis acidity and can coordinate with Lewis base to form Lewis acid&#8208;base adducts, and notably, such intermolecular complexation can further dynamically modulate their ICT transitions and thereby photophysical properties, such as producing blue, green and red fluorescences.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring the CO2 hydrogenation performance of Fe&#8208;based catalyst via unique confinement effect of the carbon shell</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Even though Fe&#8208;based catalysts have been widely employed for CO2 hydrogenation into hydrocarbons, oxygenates, liquid fuels, etc., the precise regulation of their physicochemical properties is needed to enhance the catalytic performance. Herein, under the guidance of the traditional concept in heterogeneous catalysis&#8208;confinement effect, we construct a core&#8208;shell structured catalyst Na&#8208;Fe3O4@C to boost the CO2 hydrogenation performance. Benefiting from the carbon&#8208;chain growth limitation, tailorable H2/CO2 ratio on the catalytic interface, and unique electronic property that all endowed by the confinement effect, the selectivity and space&#8208;time yield of light olefins (C2=&#8208;C4=) are as high as 47.4% and 15.9 g molFe&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, respectively, which are all notably higher than that from the shell&#8208;less counterpart. The function mechanism of the confinement effect in Fe&#8208;based catalysts are clarified in detail by multiple characterization and density functional theory (DFT). This work may offer a new prospect for the rational design of CO2 hydrogenation catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Green and facile preparation of covalent organic frameworks based on reaction medium for advanced applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), as a new class of crystalline, well&#8208;ordered, and porous materials with intermittent constructions, are formed via organic structural parts connected through covalent bonds. These materials have been employed in several fields comprising pollutant adsorption and separation, catalysis, electrical conductivity, gas storage, etc. The preparation of COFs is mainly applied in tubes with high temperatures and degassing treatment. Furthermore, the reaction medium is involved in toxic organic solvents like toluene, dioxane, mesitylene, acetonitrile, and so on. Hence, discovering clean medium and green approaches have attracted wide attention. Recently, facial, less dangerous, and greener methods have been developed for COFs synthesis in diverse applications like performing the reaction at ambient temperature or employing aqueous solvents, ionic liquids, and a mixture of organic solvents/water. This review article summarizes the eco&#8208;friendly production approaches of COFs for diverse applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Human milk oligosaccharides (HMO) have emerged as a very active area of research in glycoscience and nutrition. HMO are involved in the early development of infants and may help to prevent certain diseases. The development of chemical methods for obtaining individual HMO aids the global effort dedicated to understanding the roles of these biomolecules. Reported herein is the chemical synthesis of two common core hexasaccharides found in human milk, i. e.para&#8208;lacto&#8208;N&#8208;hexaose (pLNH) and para&#8208;lacto&#8208;N&#8208;neohexaose (pLNnH). After screening multiple leaving groups and temporary protecting group combinations, we found that a 3+3 convergent coupling strategy works best for obtaining these linear glycans.</dc:description>

         <title>Diphenylpyrrole&#8208;Strapped Calix[4]pyrrole Extractant for the Fluoride and Chloride Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The anion binding features of diphenylpyrrole&#8208;strapped calix[4]pyrrole 1 have been investigated by means of 1H NMR spectroscopy and ITC (isothermal titration calorimetry), as well as single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. Receptor 1 bearing an auxiliary pyrrolic NH donor and solubilizing phenyl groups on the strap was found to bind F&#8211;, Cl&#8211;, and Br&#8211;as their tetrabutylammonium salts with high affinity in DMSO&#8208;d6. In addition, receptor 1 was found to extract the fluoride anion (as both its tetraethylammonium (TEA+) and tetrabutylammonium (TBA+) salts), as well as the chloride anion into chloroform&#8208;d from an aqueous source phase. Cation metathesis using TBAI or the use of a dual host approach involving crown ethers enabled receptor 1 to extract simple alkali metal fluoride or chloride salts from water. Quantitative binding of NaF by receptor 1 was observed in 20% D2O&#8208;DMSO&#8208;d6 allowing for the direct determination of the NaF concentration in an unknown sample.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Photochromic Phosphines by Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Annulation Reaction of Alkynes bearing Phosphinyl Substituent with a Silacyclopropene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of phosphines with light controlled basicity is presented in this study. A methodological approach for the preparation of these unconventional photochromic phosphines based on a dithienylethene organic moiety is reported. It relies on the palladium&#8208;catalyzed annulation of alkynyl phosphines in the presence of a 2,3&#8208;Dithienylsilacyclopropene. Accordingly, a diphenyphosphino moiety is connected to the organic photochrome thanks to different linkers. Their influence on the photochromism and on the phosphinyl group basicity is studied and evaluated based on experimental an NMR descriptor as well as DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Solid&#8208;State [4+4] Cycloaddition and Cycloreversion with Use of Unpaired Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Donors to Achieve Solvatomorphism and Stabilization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The crystal structure of a commercially available anthracene derivative, anthracene&#8208;9&#8208;thiocarboxamide, is reported here for the first time, and we demonstrate that the compound undergoes a [4+4] cycloaddition in the solid state to afford facile synthesis of the cycloadduct (CA). The cycloaddition is also reversible in the solid state using heat or mechanical force. Due to the presence of unpaired, strong hydrogen&#8208;bond donor atoms on the CA, significant solvatomorphism is achieved, and components of the solvatomorphs self&#8208;assemble into four different classes of supramolecular structures. The CA readily crystallizes with a variety of structurally&#8208;diverse solvents including those containing oxygen&#8208;, nitrogen&#8208;, or pi&#8208;acceptors. Some of the solvents the CA crystallized with include thiophene, benzene, and the three xylene isomers; thus, we employed the CA in industrially&#8208;relevant solvent separation. However, in competition studies, the CA did not exhibit selectivity. Lastly, we demonstrate that the CA crystallizes with vinyl&#8208;containing monomers and is currently the only compound that crystallizes with both widely used monomers 4&#8208;vinylpyridine and styrene. Solid&#8208;state complexation of the CA with the monomers affords over a 50 &#176;C increase in the monomer&#8217;s thermal stabilities. We expect the strategy of designing molecules with unused donors can be applied to achieve separations or volatile liquid stabilization.</dc:description>

         <title>Silicon&#8208; and Germanium&#8208;Functionalized Perylene Diimides: Synthesis, Optoelectronic Properties, and Their Application as Non&#8208;fullerene Acceptors in Organic Solar Cells</title>

In with the old: Perylene diimide, one of the oldest electron acceptors, was functionalized with group&#8197;14 elements in the bay position. The influence of these substitutions on their properties and performance in organic photovoltaics was thoroughly studied.







Abstract
Organic solar cells have been continuously studied and developed through the last decades. A major step in their development was the introduction of fused&#8208;ring non&#8208;fullerene electron acceptors. Yet, beside their high efficiency, they suffer from complex synthesis and stability issues. Perylene&#8208;based non&#8208;fullerene acceptors, in contrast, can be prepared in only a few steps and display good photochemical and thermal stability. Herein, we introduce four monomeric perylene diimide acceptors obtained in a three&#8208;step synthesis. In these molecules, the semimetals silicon and germanium were added in the bay position, on one or both sides of the molecules, resulting in asymmetric and symmetric compounds with a red&#8208;shifted absorption compared to unsubstituted perylene diimide. Introducing two germanium atoms improved the crystallinity and charge carrier mobility in the blend with the conjugated polymer PM6. In addition, charge carrier separation is significantly influenced by the high crystallinity of this blend, as shown by transient absorption spectroscopy. As a result, the solar cells reached a power conversion efficiency of 5.38&#8201;%, which is one of the highest efficiencies of monomeric perylene diimide&#8208;based solar cells recorded to date.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Coordination&#8208;Mediated H&#8208;Aggregates of Cyanine Dyes for Effective Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
H&#8208;aggregation behaviors of cyanine dyes induced by metal ions Fe2+ or Mn2+ for effective photothermal therapy have been studied. The ROS (O2&#8722;) generation efficiency varies depending on the extent of H&#8208;aggregates, which further affects their photothermal stability. Thus, the photothermal performance of Cy&#8208;3COOH/M NPs could be manipulated by the degree of H&#8208;aggregation.







Abstract
Integration of cyanine dyes and metal ions into one nanoplatform via metal&#8208;coordination interactions is an effective strategy to build multimodality phototheranostics. The multifunctionalities of the formed nanoscale metal&#8211;organic particles (NMOPs) have been widely explored. However, the effect of metal&#8208;coordination interaction on the aggregation behavior of cyanine dyes is rarely reported. Herein, we reported the H&#8208;aggregation behavior of cyanine dye Cy&#8208;3COOH induced by different metal ions M (Fe2+ or Mn2+). Moreover, the extent of H&#8208;aggregates varied with different metal&#8208;coordination interactions. Upon NIR irradiation, H&#8208;aggregates of Cy&#8208;3COOH remarkably promoted photothermal conversion efficiency. Interestingly, we also find that H&#8208;aggregates of Cy&#8208;3COOH induced by metal ions can generate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) involving singlet oxygen (1O2) and superoxide anion radical (O2&#8722;&#8901;) upon light irradiation. In addition, the ROS efficiency varies depending on the extent of H&#8208;aggregates. Additionally, the photoinduced ROS could disassemble aggregates and decompose cyanine dye Cy&#8208;3COOH, which limits the photothermal capability of Cy&#8208;3COOH/M NPs. Therefore, the photothermal performance of Cy&#8208;3COOH/M NPs could be manipulated by the degree of H&#8208;aggregation. This would provide a new insight to develop efficient phototheranostics NMOPs for cancer treatment.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Migratory and Cytotoxic Activities of [Ga(8&#8208;hydroxyquinolinato)3]: Roles of Endogenous Cu(II) and Drug&#8208;Induced Phenotypic Changes</title>

[GaQ3] (Q=8&#8208;hydroxyquinolinato) is the first metal complex likely to induce terminal differentiation in invasive human cancer cells (MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231) that could be used in differentiation cancer therapy, when combined with the highly cytotoxic [CuQ2] generated in&#8197;situ by partial ligand release.







Abstract
As shown by IncuCyte Zoom imaging proliferation assays, invasive triple&#8208;negative human breast MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cancer cells treated with sub&#8208;toxic doses (5.0&#8211;20&#8197;&#956;M, 72&#8197;h) of [GaQ3] (Q=8&#8208;hydroxyquinolinato) caused profound morphological changes and inhibition of cell migration, which were likely due to terminal cell differentiation or similar phenotypical change. This is the first demonstration of potential use of a metal complex in differentiation anti&#8208;cancer therapy. Additionally, a trace amount of Cu(II) (0.20&#8197;&#956;M) added to the medium dramatically increased [GaQ3] cytotoxicity (IC50~2&#8197;&#956;M, 72&#8197;h) due to its partial dissociation and the action of the HQ ligand as a Cu(II) ionophore, as shown with electrospray mass spectrometry and fluorescence spectroscopy assays in the medium. Hence, cytotoxicity of [GaQ3] is strongly linked to ligand binding of essential metal ions in the medium, for example, Cu(II). Appropriate delivery mechanisms of such complexes and their ligands could enable a powerful new triple therapeutic approach for cancer chemotherapy, including cytotoxicity against primary tumour, arrest of metastases, and activation of innate and adaptive immune responses.

         <title>Photochemical [2+2] Cycloaddition of Alkynyl Boronates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition of alkynyl boronates and maleimides is described as a convenient method for the synthesis of polysubstituted borylated cyclobutenes tolerating a wide range of functional groups. Physicochemical and structural properties of the products obtained provide rationale for their application as phthalimide isosteric replacements, for example, in Thalidomide. Mechanistic studies confirm that the [2+2] cycloaddition proceeds through initial excitation of the maleimide component.







Abstract
A photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition of alkynyl boronates and maleimides is reported. The developed protocol provided 35&#8211;70&#8201;% yield of maleimide&#8208;derived cyclobutenyl boronates and demonstrated wide compatibility with various functional groups. The synthetic utility of the prepared building blocks was demonstrated for a range of transformations, including Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling, catalytic or metal&#8208;hydride reduction, oxidation, and cycloaddition reactions. With aryl&#8208;substituted alkynyl boronates, the products of double [2+2] cycloaddition were obtained predominantly. Using the developed protocol, a cyclobutene&#8208;derived analogue of Thalidomide was prepared in one step. Mechanistic studies supported the participation of the triplet&#8208;excited state maleimides and ground state alkynyl boronates in the key step of the process.

Mechanistic studies confirm that the [2+2] cycloaddition proceeds through initial excitation of the maleimide component.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition of alkynyl boronates and maleimides is reported. The developed protocol provided 35&#8211;70&#8201;% yield of maleimide-derived cyclobutenyl boronates and demonstrated wide compatibility with various functional groups. The synthetic utility of the prepared building blocks was demonstrated for a range of transformations, including Suzuki cross-coupling, catalytic or metal-hydride reduction, oxidation, and cycloaddition reactions. With aryl-substituted alkynyl boronates, the products of double [2+2] cycloaddition were obtained predominantly. Using the developed protocol, a cyclobutene-derived analogue of Thalidomide was prepared in one step. Mechanistic studies supported the participation of the triplet-excited state maleimides and ground state alkynyl boronates in the key step of the process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Effects of the Magnetic Orientation of M13 Bacteriophage on Phage Display Selection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although phage display selection using a library of M13 bacteriophage has become a powerful tool for finding peptides binding to target materials, a remaining concern of this method is the interference by the M13 main body, which is a huge filament &gt;103 times larger than the displayed peptide, and therefore would nonspecifically adhere to the target or sterically inhibit the binding of the displayed peptide. Meanwhile, filamentous phages are known to be orientable by a magnetic field. If M13 filaments are magnetically oriented during the selection, their angular arrangement toward the target surface would be changed, being expected to control the interference by the M13 main body. Here we report that the magnetic orientation of M13 filaments vertical to the target surface significantly affects the selection. When the target surface was affinitive to the M13 main body, this orientation notably suppressed the nonspecific adhesion. Furthermore, when the target surface was less affinitive to the M13 main body and intrinsically free from the nonspecific adhesion, this orientation drastically changed the population of M13 clones obtained through selection. Our method of using no chemicals but only a physical stimulus, is simple, clean, and expected to expand the scope of phage display selection.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring Hydrogen Storage Capacity in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: A Bayesian Optimization Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic Frameworks (MOFs) can be employed for gas storage, capture, and sensing.&#160; Finding the MOF with the best adsorption property from a big database is usual for adsorption calculations. In high&#8208;throughput computational research, the expense of computing thermodynamic quantities limits the finding of MOFs for separations and storage.&#160;In this work, we demonstrate the usefulness of Bayesian optimization (BO) for estimating the H2 uptake capability of MOFs by using an existing dataset containing 98 000 real as well as hypothetical MOFs. It is demonstrated that in order to recover the best candidate MOFs, less than 0.027% of the database needs to be screened using the BO method. This allows future adsorption experiments on a small sample of MOFs to be undertaken with minimal experimental effort by effectively screening MOF databases. In addition, the presented BO can provide comprehensible material design insights, and the framework will be transferable to the setting of other target properties. We suggest using particle swarm optimisation (PSO), a swarm intelligence technique in artificial intelligence, to estimate MOFs' H2 uptake potential to achieve results comparable to BO. In addition, we have implemented the novel evolutionary&#8208;PSO (EPSO) method for comparison research and found some extremely interesting outcomes.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals represent a peculiar class of heterocyclic merocyanines, compounds bearing pronounced and rather short dipoles with great push&#8208;pull characteristics that define their rich properties. They are accessible via a wide array of synthetic concepts and procedures, ranging from addition&#8208;elimination and condensation procedures up to rearrangement and metal&#8208;mediated reactions. With our work from 2020, aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals have been identified as powerful and promising dyes with pronounced and vastly tunable solid&#8208;state emission and aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties. One characteristic trademark of this class of dye molecules is the level of control that could be exerted and which was thoroughly explored. Based on these results, the field was opened to extend the system to bi&#8208; and multichromophoric systems by the full toolkit of synthetic organic chemistry thus giving access to even more exciting properties and manifolded substance libraries capitalizing on the AIE properties. This review aims at outlining the reaction&#8208;based principles that allow for a swift and facile access to aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals, their methodological and structural evolution and the plethora of fluorescence and aggregation properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Slow Magnetization Relaxation in a Family of Triangular {CoIII2LnIII} Clusters: The Effect of Diamagnetic CoIII Ions on the LnIII Magnetic Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first use of the Schiff base chelate N&#8208;naphthalidene&#8208;o&#8208;aminophenol (naphH2) in Co/Ln chemistry has afforded a family of isostructural [CoIII2LnIII(OMe)2(naph)2(O2CMe)3(MeOH)2] (Ln = Tb, Dy and Er) complexes, revealing a rare {CoIII2Ln(&#956;3&#8208;OMe)}8+ triangular core composed of two diamagnetic CoIII ions and a 4f&#8208;ion with slightly distorted square antiprismatic geometry. Alternating current (ac) magnetic susceptibility studies revealed that {Co2Dy}, and its magnetic diluted analogue {Co2Dy0.05Y0.95}, behave as mononuclear single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) with similar energy barriers for the magnetization reversal, Ueff, of ~85&#8208;90 K. SMM properties were also detected for {Co2Er}, with the compound exhibiting a Ueff of 18.7 K under an applied magnetic field of 800 Oe. To interpret the experimental magnetic results, ab initio CASSCF/RASSI&#8208;SO and DFT calculations were performed as a means of exploring the single&#8208;ion characteristics of LnIII ions and comprehend the role of the diamagnetic CoIII ions in the magnetization relaxation of the three heterometallic compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Post&#8208;synthetic nucleobase modification of oligonucleotides by Sonogashira coupling and influence of alkynyl modifications on the duplex&#8208;forming ability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, we reported that the alkynyl modification of nucleobases mitigates the toxicity of antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) while maintaining the efficacy. However, the general effect of alkynyl modifications on the duplex&#8208;forming ability of oligonucleotides (ONs) is unclear. In this study, post&#8208;synthetic nucleobase modification by Sonogashira coupling in aqueous medium was carried out to efficiently evaluate the physiological properties of various ONs with alkynyl&#8208;modified nucleobases. Although several undesired reactions, including nucleobase cyclization, were observed, various types of alkynyl&#8208;modified ONs were successfully obtained via Sonogashira coupling of ONs containing iodinated nucleobases. Evaluation of the stability of the duplex formed by the synthesized alkynyl&#8208;modified ONs showed that the alkynyl modification of pyrimidine was less tolerated than that of purine, although both the modifications occurred in the major groove of the duplex. These results can be attributed to the bond angle of the alkyne on the pyrimidine and the close proximity of the alkynyl substituents to the phosphodiester backbone. The synthetic method developed in this study may contribute to the screening of the optimal chemical modification of ASO because various alkynyl&#8208;modified ONs that are effective in reducing the toxicity of ASO can be easily synthesized by this method.</dc:description>

         <title>Weakly Self&#8208;Assembled [6]helicenes:&#160;Circularly Polarized Light and Spin Filtering Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein on the self&#8208;assembling features, chiroptical activity, and spin filtering properties of 2,15&#8208; and 4,13&#8208;disubstituted [6]helicenes decorated in their periphery with 3,4,5&#8208;tris(dodecyloxy)&#8208;N&#8208;(4&#8208;ethynylphenyl)benzamide moieties. The weak non&#8208;covalent interaction between these units conditions the corresponding circularly polarized luminescence and spin polarization. The self&#8208;assembly is overall weak for these [6]helicene derivatives that, despite the formation of H&#8208;bonding interactions between the amide groups present in the peripheral moieties, shows very similar chiroptical properties both in the monomeric or aggregated states. This effect could be explained by considering the steric effect that these groups could generate in the growing of the corresponding aggregate formed. Importantly, the self&#8208;assembling features also condition chiral induced spin selectivity (CISS effect), with experimental spin polarization (SP) values found between 35&#8208;40% for both systems, as measured by magnetic&#8208;conducting atomic force microscopy (AFM) technique.</dc:description>

Importantly, the self-assembling features also condition chiral induced spin selectivity (CISS effect), with experimental spin polarization (SP) values found between 35-40% for both systems, as measured by magnetic-conducting atomic force microscopy (AFM) technique.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Acetylene Semi&#8208;hydrogenation at Room Temperature over Pd&#8208;Zn Nanocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acetylene impurity in the ethylene feedstock used in the polyethylene industry poisons the Ziegler&#8208;Natta catalyst which adversely affects the polymer quality. Pd based catalysts often employed for converting acetylene into ethylene, involves a tradeoff between the conversion and the selectivity and generally requires high temperatures. Here, bimetallic Pd&#8208;Zn nanoparticles capped by hexadecylamine (HDA) have been synthesized by co&#8208;digestive ripening of Pd and Zn nanoparticles and studied for semi&#8208;hydrogenation of acetylene. The catalyst showed a high selectivity of ~85% towards ethylene with a high ethylene productivity to the tune of ~4341 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 min&#8208;1, at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. It also exhibited excellent stability with ethylene selectivity remaining greater than 85% even after 70 h on stream. This is the first report of room temperature acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation, with the catalyst effecting high amount of acetylene conversion to ethylene retaining excellent selectivity and stability among all the reported catalysts thus far. DFT calculations show that the disordered Pd&#8208;Zn nanocatalyst exhibits a change in the d&#8208;band center of Pd and Zn which in turn enhances the selectivity towards ethylene. In&#8208;depth analysis into the reaction mechanism, indicate the key role of particle size, surface area, Pd&#8208;Zn interactions, and the capping agent.</dc:description>

         <title>Base&#8208;Stabilized Phosphinidene Oxide, Imide and Sulfide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Base&#8208;stabilized phosphinidene was used to prepare phosphinidene oxide, imide and sulfide. Labile phosphinidene oxide and imide were trapped with p&#8208;tolyl isocyanate, the mechanism of the process was elaborated by DFT calculations. Phosphinidene sulfide was isolated and structurally characterized.







Abstract
Oxidation of a base&#8208;stabilized phosphinidene (&#954;2&#8208;NNP)P (12, NNP=phosphinoamidinate) with N2O afforded a labile phosphinidene oxide (&#954;2&#8208;NNP)P=O (16) which was characterized by NMR spectroscopy. Further oxidation of 16 by N2O or reaction of 12 with two equivalents of pyridine oxide afforded the isolable dioxide (&#954;2&#8208;NNP)PO2 which was characterized by NMR and SC XRD. Trapping of 16 with tolyl isocyanate resulted in P=O/N=C metathesis, eventually affording a urea&#8208;ligated phosphine (&#954;1&#8208;NNP)P(NTol)2C=O (17) The mechanism of this reaction was elucidated by DFT calculations. Reactions of phosphinidene 12 with azides generated transient imines (NNP)P=NR, which in the case of R=Tol underwent cycloaddition with tolyl Isocyanate to afford the urea product 17, and in the case of R=SiMe3 reacts with N3SiMe3 via the addition of N&#8722;Si across the P=N bond affording, after the extrusion of dinitrogen, a P,N&#8208;heterocyclic compound. Both products of the reactions with azides have been fully characterized, both in solution and the solid&#8208;state. Finally, reaction of phosphinidene 12 with one equivalent of sulfur resulted in the isolation of the base&#8208;stabilized phosphinidene sulfide (&#954;2&#8208;NNP)P=S that has also been fully characterized.

         <title>A Membrane&#8208;Free Decoupled Water Electrolyzer Operating at Simulated Fluctuating Renewables with Tri&#8208;Functional NiCo&#8208;P Electrode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A membrane&#8208;free decoupled alkaline water electrolyzer was constructed using a graphite felt supported nickel&#8208;cobalt phosphate material as the tri&#8208;functional electrode, which significantly improves the flexibility of water splitting.







Abstract
Water electrolysis has been considered a promising technology for the conversion of renewables to hydrogen. However, preventing mixing of products (H2 and O2) and exploring cost&#8208;efficient electrolysis components remains challenging for conventional water electrolyzers. Herein, we designed a membrane&#8208;free decoupled water electrolysis system by using graphite felt supported nickel&#8208;cobalt phosphate (GF@NixCoy&#8208;P) material as a tri&#8208;functional (redox mediator, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER)) electrode. The versatile GF@Ni1Co1&#8208;P electrode obtained by a one&#8208;step electrodeposition not only exhibits high specific capacity (176&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and long cycle life (80&#8201;% capacity retention after 3000 cycles) as a redox mediator, but also has relatively outstanding catalytic activities for HER and OER. The excellent properties of the GF@NixCoy&#8208;P electrode endow this decoupled system with more flexibility for H2 production by fluctuating renewable energies. This work provides guidance for multifunctional applications of transition metal compounds between energy storage and electrocatalysis.

Abstract
Two wide&#8208;band&#8208;capturing donor&#8208;acceptor conjugates featuring bis&#8208;styrylBODIPY and perylenediimide (PDI) have been newly synthesized, and the occurrence of ultrafast excitation transfer from the 1PDI* to BODIPY, and a subsequent electron transfer from the 1BODIPY* to PDI have been demonstrated. Optical absorption studies revealed panchromatic light capture but offered no evidence of ground&#8208;state interactions between the donor and acceptor entities. Steady&#8208;state fluorescence and excitation spectral recordings provided evidence of singlet&#8208;singlet energy transfer in these dyads, and quenched fluorescence of bis&#8208;styrylBODIPY emission in the dyads suggested additional photo&#8208;events. The facile oxidation of bis&#8208;styrylBODIPY and facile reduction of PDI, establishing their relative roles of electron donor and acceptor, were borne out by electrochemical studies. The electrostatic potential surfaces of the S1 and S2 states, derived from time&#8208;dependent DFT calculations, supported excited charge transfer in these dyads. Spectro&#8208;electrochemical studies on one&#8208;electron&#8208;oxidized and one&#8208;electron&#8208;reduced dyads and the monomeric precursor compounds were also performed in a thin&#8208;layer optical cell under corresponding applied potentials. From this study, both bis&#8208;styrylBODIPY&#8901;+ and PDI&#8901;&#8722; could be spectrally characterizes and were subsequently used in characterizing the electron&#8208;transfer products. Finally, pump&#8211;probe spectral studies were performed in dichlorobenzene under selective PDI and bis&#8208;styrylBODIPY excitation to secure energy and electron&#8208;transfer evidence. The measured rate constants for energy transfer, kENT, were in the range of 1011&#8197;s&#8722;1, while the electron transfer rate constants, kET, were in the range of 1010&#8197;s&#8722;1, thus highlighting their potential use in solar energy harvesting and optoelectronic applications.

         <title>A New Pathway for the Synthesis of Ketones from Aldehydes and Sulfonylhydrazones: Is Diazo the Key Intermediate?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable and efficient method suitable for the preparation of a wide variety of ketones via new intermediate V has been developed.







Abstract
A new pathway via a cyclic intermediate for the synthesis of ketones from aldehydes and sulfonylhydrazone derivatives under basic conditions is proposed. Several control experiments were performed along with analysis of the mass spectra and in&#8208;situ IR spectra of the reaction mixture. Inspired by the new mechanism, an efficient and scalable method for homologation of aldehydes to ketones was developed. A wide variety of target ketones were obtained in yields of 42&#8211;95&#8201;% by simply heating the 3&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)benzene sulfonylhydrazones (3&#8208;(Tfsyl)hydrazone) for 2&#8197;h at 110&#8201;&#176;C with aldehydes and with K2CO3 and DMSO as base and solvent, respectively.

         <title>Diiminium Nucleophile Adducts Are Stable and Convenient Strong Lewis Acids
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diiminium nucleophile adducts, convenient Lewis acids that satisfy some measures for superacidity, have been synthesised by coordination with stabilising pyridine donors. Even in their abstraction of half an equivalent of oxide from a P=O bond, favourable abstraction kinetics were observed. Our preliminary results combined with price and safety considerations suggest that the adducts are excellent acylation reagents.







Abstract
Strong Lewis acids are essential tools for manifold chemical procedures, but their scalable deployment is limited by their costs and safety concerns. We report a scalable, convenient, and inexpensive synthesis of stable diiminium&#8208;based reagents with a Lewis acidic carbon centre. Coordination with pyridine donors stabilises these centres; the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine adduct shows a chelation effect at carbon. Due to high fluoride, hydride, and oxide affinities, the diiminium pyridine adducts are promising soft and hard Lewis acids. They effectively produce acylpyridinium salts from carboxylates that can acylate amines to give amides and imides even from electronically intractable coupling partners.

         <title>Merging Solid&#8208;Phase Peptide Synthesis and Automated Glycan Assembly to Prepare Lipid&#8208;Peptide&#8208;Glycan Chimeras</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lipid&#8208;peptide&#8208;glycan chimeras are prepared in a stepwise&#8208;automated manner combing their solid&#8208;phase syntheses, as an alternative to classic late&#8208;stage conjugation. A variety of supramolecular structures are generated my merging peptide amphiphiles and lipids with oligosaccharides.







Abstract
Biomaterials with improved biological features can be obtained by conjugating glycans to nanostructured peptides. Creating peptide&#8208;glycan chimeras requires superb chemoselectivity. We expedite access to such chimeras by merging peptide and glycan solid&#8208;phase syntheses employing a bifunctional monosaccharide. The concept was explored in the context of the on&#8208;resin generation of a model &#945;(1&#8594;6)tetramannoside linked to peptides, lipids, steroids, and adamantane. Chimeras containing a &#946;(1&#8594;6)tetraglucoside and self&#8208;assembling peptides such as FF, FFKLVFF, and the amphiphile palmitoyl&#8208;VVVAAAKKK were prepared in a fully automated manner. The robust synthetic protocol requires a single purification step to obtain overall yields of about 20&#8201;%. The &#946;(1&#8594;6)tetraglucoside FFKLVFF chimera produces micelles rather than nanofibers formed by the peptide alone as judged by microscopy and circular dichroism. The peptide amphiphile&#8208;glycan chimera forms a disperse fiber network, creating opportunities for new glycan&#8208;based nanomaterials.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A family of propeller&#8208;shaped donor&#8211;acceptor hexapyrrolylbenzenes (HPBs) were designed and synthesized by sequential nucleophilic substitution of hexafluorobenzene with &#960;&#8208;extended pyrroles. In particular, four hybrids were obtained, containing various combinations of electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor acenaphthylene&#8208;fused pyrroles. Additionally, to probe the efficiency of ortho transfer interactions, a system was designed containing unique donor and acceptor subunits spatially separated with four unfunctionalized pyrroles. DFT calculations showed propeller&#8208;shaped geometries of all HPB molecules and separation of frontier molecular orbitals between donor and acceptor subunits. Steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved photophysical measurements revealed charge&#8208;transfer (CT) character of the emission with strong positive dependence on solvent polarity. The principal CT pathway involves ortho&#8208;positioned pairs of donors and acceptors and requires bending of the acceptor in the excited state</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;doped Graphene Quantum Dots as Electrochemiluminescence&#8208;Emitting Species for Sensitive Detection of KRAS G12C Mutation via PET&#8208;RAFT</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The levels of KRAS G12C point mutation is recognized to be closely related to the earlier diagnosis of non&#8208;small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here, based on nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene quantum dots (NGQDs) and photo&#8208;induced electron/energy transfer reversible addition&#8208;fragment chain transfer (PET&#8208;RAFT) signal amplification strategy, we fabricated a novel electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor for the detection of KRAS G12C mutation for the first time. NGQDs as ECL&#8208;emitting species with cathodic ECL were prepared by a simple calcination method. Firstly, KRAS G12C mutations DNA, i.e. target DNA (tDNA), was captured by specific identification with hairpin DNA (hDNA). Then, PET&#8208;RAFT was initiated by blue light, and large numbers of monomers were successfully polymerized to form controllable polymer chains. Lastly, massive NGQDs was introduced via amidation reaction with N&#8208;(3&#8208;aminopropyl)methacrylamide hydrochloride(APMA), which significantly amplified the ECL signal intensity. Under optimal conditions, this biosensor achieved a good linear relationship between ECL intensity and logarithm of the levels of KRAS G12C mutation in the range from 10 fM to 10 nM. Moreover, this strategy exhibited high selectivity and excellent applicability for KRAS G12C mutation detection in the serum samples. Therefore, this biosensor has great potential in clinical diagnosis and practical application.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development and utilization of green renewable energy are imperative with the aggravation of environmental pollution and energy crisis. In recent years, the exploration of electrochemical energy storage systems has gradually become a research hotspot in energy. Among them, aqueous zinc ion batteries (ZIBs) have progressively developed into highly competitive and efficient energy storage devices owing to their inherent safety, natural abundance, and higher theoretical capacity. However, the practical application of ZIBs suffers from the limitation of challenges such as the absence of proper cathode materials and the unavoidable zinc dendrites and side reactions of Zn anode. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are an attractive class of electrode materials due to their inherent advantages, like structural designability, high stability, and ordered&#8208;open channels, bestowing them with great potential to overcome the problems of ZIBs. In this review, we concentrate on the discussion of designed strategies of COFs applied to ZIBs. Furthermore, the methods of using COFs to solve the challenging problems of cathode development, anode modification, and electrolyte optimization for ZIBs are summarized. Finally, the existing difficulties, solution measures, and prospects of COFs for ZIBs applications are discussed. Our commentary hopes to serve as a valuable reference for developing COFs&#8208;based ZIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Amphiphilic Molecules Exhibiting Zwitterionic Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer and Near&#8208;Infrared Emission for the Detection of Amyloid &#946;&#160;Aggregates in Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chromophores with zwitterionic excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) have been shown to have larger Stock shifts and red&#8208;shifted emission wavelengths compared to the conventional &#960;&#8208;delocalized ESIPT molecules. However, there is still a dearth of design strategies to expand the current library of zwitterionic ESIPT compounds. Herein, we report a novel zwitterionic excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer system enabled by addition of 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane (TACN) fragments on a dicyanomethylene&#8208;4H&#8208;pyran (DCM) scaffold. The solvent&#8208;dependent steady&#8208;state photophysical studies, pKa measurements, and computational analysis strongly support that the ESIPT process is more efficient with two TACN groups attached to the DCM scaffold and not affected by polar protic solvents. Impressively, compound DCM&#8208;OH&#8208;2&#8208;DT exhibits a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission at 740 nm along with an uncommonly large Stokes shift. Moreover, DCM&#8208;OH&#8208;2&#8208;DT shows high affinity towards soluble amyloid &#946; (A&#946;) oligomers in vitro and in 5xFAD mouse brain sections, and we have successfully applied DCM&#8208;OH&#8208;2&#8208;DT for the in vivo imaging of A&#946; aggregates and demonstrated its potential use as an early diagnostic agent for AD. Overall, this study can provide a general molecular design strategy for developing new zwitterionic ESIPT compounds with NIR emission in vivo imaging applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Synthesis of ABCD&#8208;Porphyrin Platinum(II) Complexes via Dehydrative Aromatization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study describes synthesis of ABCD&#8208;porphryin Pt(II) complexes via dehydrative aromatization in one&#8208;pot from corresponding dipyrrinatoPt(II) complexes and bisformyldipyrrins. This procedure also enables the construction of a C1&#8208;symmetrical ABCD&#8208;porphyrin with intrinsic chirality from achiral precursors. The photophysical properties of obtained molecules are also described in detail.







Abstract
Since the development of the first method for porphyrin synthesis by Rothemund in 1935, porphyrin derivatives have been widely investigated and have played an essential role in chemical sciences. Most synthetic routes of porphyrins involve oxidative aromatization. Herein, we present a synthetic method to produce ABCD&#8208;porphyrins, including chiral ones, through a one&#8208;pot reaction involving &#8220;coordination, cyclization, and dehydrative aromatization&#8221; using a mono&#8208;dipyrrinatoPt(II)Cl(COE) (COE=cyclooctene) complex as a platinum template.

         <title>Mn(II) Polypyridyl Complexes: Precursors to High Valent Mn(V)=O Species and Inhibitors of Cancer Cell Proliferation</title>

High valent MnV=O at room temperature: This works highlights the identification and characterization of a transient MnV=O species with the help of an in&#8197;situ generated anionic moiety. The oxidative species are mapped to trigger intracellular redox modulation to prevent cancer cell proliferation.







Abstract
The reaction of [(L)MnII]2+ (L = neutral polypyridine ligand framework) in the presence of mCPBA (mCPBA = m&#8208;Chloroperoxybenzoic acid) generates a putative MnV=O species at RT. The proposed MnV=O species is capable of performing the aromatic hydroxylation of Cl&#8208;benzoic acid derived from mCPBA to give [(L)MnIII(m&#8208;Cl&#8208;salicylate)]+, which in the presence of excess mCPBA generates a metastable [(L)MnV(O)(m&#8208;Cl&#8208;salicylate)]+, characterized by UV/Vis absorption, EPR, resonance Raman spectroscopy, and ESI&#8208;MS studies. The current study highlights the fact that [(L)MnIII(m&#8208;Cl&#8208;salicylate)]+ formation may not be a dead end for catalysis. Further, a plausible mechanism has been proposed for the formation of [(L)MnV(O)&#8208;m&#8208;Cl&#8208;salicylate)]+ from [(L)MnIII(m&#8208;Cl&#8208;salicylate)]+. The characterized transient [(L)MnV(O)&#8208;m&#8208;Cl&#8208;salicylate)]+ reported in the current work exhibits high reactivity for oxygen atom transfer reactions, supported by the electrophilic character depicted from Hammett studies using a series of para&#8208;substituted thioanisoles. The unprecedented study starting from a non&#8208;heme neutral polypyridine ligand framework paves a path for mimicking the natural active site of photosystem II under ambient conditions. Finally, evaluating the intracellular effect of Mn(II) complexes revealed an enhanced intracellular ROS and mitochondrial dysfunction to prevent the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma and breast cancer cells.

         <title>2H&#8208;Phosphindole&#8208;Enabled Dearomatization and [4+2] Cycloaddition of (Hetero)Arenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to their unique electronic properties, the low&#8208;coordinate heavier main&#8208;group element species display high reactivity toward inert small molecules. Transient 2H&#8208;phosphinidole working as reactive phosphadiene undergoes phospha&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with a wide range of non&#8208;activated aromatic carbocycles and heterocycles, providing simple but straightforward access to a range of polycyclic fused rings feature with bridgehead phosphorus.







Abstract
The heavier main group multiple bonds offer an effective tool for small molecule activation. Transient 2H&#8208;phosphinidole working as a reactive phosphadiene system undergoes phospha&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with a wide range of non&#8208;activated aromatic carbocycles and heterocycles, including naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene, furan, thiophene, pyrrole, pyridine, and benzo&#8208;fused heterocycles, affording concise access to a range of polycyclic fused rings feature with phosphorus at the bridgehead. These results demonstrate that non&#8208;activated (hetero)arenes are capable of acting as 2&#960; systems in [4+2] cycloaddition with highly reactive 2H&#8208;phosphindole complex.

         <dc:description>
A convenient multicomponent procedure for the borocarbonylative synthesis of gem&#8208;bis(boryl) ketones has been developed. With aliphatic terminal alkynes, CO, aryldiazonium salts, and B2pin2 as the substrates, saturated &#946;&#8208;bis(boryl) ketones were isolated in moderate to good yields by using ethyl acetate as a proton source.







Abstract
We report the development of Pd/Cu&#8208;catalyzed selective 2,1&#8208;borocarbonylation reactions of aliphatic terminal alkynes with aryldiazonium salts and B2Pin2 to prepare gem&#8208;bis(boryl) ketones in one&#8208;pot. A series of corresponding products are obtained with good to excellent yields under a carbon monoxide atmosphere (10&#8197;bar). In addition, wide functional&#8208;group tolerance can be observed. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that ethyl acetate serves as a proton source in the reaction.

         <title>Investigations of the Photothermal Properties of a Series of Molecular Gold&#8208;bis(dithiolene) Complexes Absorbing in the NIR&#8208;III Region</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photothermal properties of a series of hydrophobic gold&#8208;bis(dithiolene) absorbing in the NIR&#8208;III region were evaluated in organic solvents and in aqueous solution after encapsulation in polymer nanoparticles.







Abstract
The photothermal properties of a series of neutral radical gold&#8208;bis(dithiolene) complexes absorbing in the near&#8208;infrared&#8208;III window (1550&#8211;1870&#8197;nm) have been investigated. This class of complexes was found to be good photothermal agents (PTAs) in toluene under 1600&#8197;nm laser irradiation with photothermal efficiencies around 40 and 60&#8201;% depending on the nature of the dithiolene ligand. To the best of our knowledge, these complexes are the first small molecular photothermal agents to absorb so far into the near infrared. To test their applicability in water, these hydrophobic complexes have been encapsulated into nanoparticles constituted by amphiphilic block&#8208;copolymers. Stable suspensions of polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulating the gold&#8208;bis(dithiolene) complexes have been prepared which show a diameter around 100&#8197;nm. The encapsulation rate was found to be strongly dependent on the nature of the dithiolene ligands. The photothermal properties of the aqueous suspensions containing gold&#8208;bis(dithiolene) complexes were then studied under 1600&#8197;nm laser irradiation. These studies demonstrate that water has strong photothermal activity in the NIR&#8208;III region that, cannot be overcome even with the addition of gold complexes displaying good photothermal properties.

         <dc:description>
Meet to defeat: A strategic round&#8208;table meeting has been convened between inorganic chemistry and pharmacology to tackle malaria, one of the deadliest infectious diseases worldwide. As a result, metals have been deliberately conjugated with the antimalarial quinoline Amodiaquine. These metal&#8211;amodiaquine complexes have overcome the limitations of metal&#8208;free quinolines, and light has been shed on their potential as a chemical tool for designing new drugs against malaria and other infectious diseases susceptible to quinoline treatment. More information can be found in the Research Article by L. Colina&#8208;Vegas, D.&#8197;R.&#8197;M. Moreira and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301642).

         <title>Cold plasma for green advanced reduction/oxidation processes (AROPs) of organic pollutants in water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cold plasma is gaining increasing attention as a novel tool to activate energy demanding chemical processes, including advanced reduction/oxidation processes (AROPs) of organic pollutants in water. The very complex milieu generated by discharges at the water/plasma interface comprises photons, strong oxidants and strong reductants which can be exploited for achieving the degradation of most any kind of pollutants. Despite the complexity of these systems, the powerful arsenal of mechanistic tools and chemical probes of physical organic chemists can be usefully applied to understand and develop plasma chemistry. Specifically, the added value of air plasma generated by in situ discharge with respect to ozonation (ex situ discharge) is demonstrated using phenol and various phenol derivatives and mechanistic evidence for the prevailing role of hydroxyl radicals in the initial attack is presented. On the reduction front, the impressive performance of cold plasma in inducing the degradation of recalcitrant perfluoroalkyl substances, which do not react with OH radicals but are attacked by electrons, is reported and discussed. The widely different reactivities of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and of perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) underline the crucial role played in these processes by the interface between plasma and solution and the surfactant properties of the treated pollutants.</dc:description>

         <title>Closed Synthetic Cycle for Nickel&#8208;Based Dihydrogen Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dihydrogen evolution was observed in a two&#8208;step protonation reaction starting from a Ni(0) precursor with a tripodal N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand. &#160;Upon the first protonation, a Ni(II) monohydride complex is formed, isolated, and fully characterized. &#160;Subsequent protonation yields H2via a transient intermediate (INT) and an isolable Ni(II) acetonitrile complex. &#160;The latter can be reduced to regenerate its Ni(0) precursor. &#160;The mechanism of H2 formation was investigated by using a deute&#173;rated acid and scrutinized by 1H NMR spectroscopy and gas chromatography. &#160;Remarkably, the second protona&#173;tion forms a rare nickel dihydrogen complex, detected and identified in solution, and characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy. DFT&#8208;based computational analyses were employed to propose a reaction profile and a molecular structure of a Ni&#8210;H2 complex. &#160;Thus, a dihydrogen&#8208;evolving, closed&#8208;synthetic cycle is reported with a rare Ni&#8211;H2 species as a key intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling the crystallisation and hydration state of crystalline porous organic salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Crystalline porous organic salts (CPOS) are a subclass of molecular crystals. The low solubility of CPOS and their building blocks limits the choice of crystallisation solvents to water or polar alcohols, hindering the isolation, scale&#8208;up, and scope of the porous material. In this work, high throughput screening was used to expand the solvent scope, resulting in the identification of a new porous salt, CPOS&#8208;7, formed from tetrakis(4&#8208;sulfophenyl)methane (TSPM) and tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)methane (TAPM). CPOS&#8208;7 does not form with standard solvents for CPOS, rather a hydrated phase (Hydrate2920) previously reported is isolated. Initial attempts to translate the crystallisation to batch led to challenges with loss of crystallinity and Hydrate2920 forming favorably in the presence of excess water. Using acetic acid as a dehydrating agent hindered formation of Hydrate2920 and furthermore allowed for direct conversion to CPOS&#8208;7. To allow for direct formation of CPOS&#8208;7 in high crystallinity flow chemistry was used for the first time to circumvent the issues found in batch. CPOS&#8208;7 and Hydrate2920 were shown to have promise for water and CO2 capture, with CPOS&#8208;7 having a CO2 uptake of 4.3 mmol/g at 195 K, making it one of the most porous CPOS reported to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent Acts as the Referee in a Match&#8208;up Between Charged and Preorganized Receptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The prevalence of cation&#8208;anion contacts in biomolecular recognition under aqueous conditions suggests that ionic interactions should dominate the binding of anions in solvents across both high and low polarities. Investigations of this idea using titrations in low polarity solvents are impaired by interferences from ion pairing that prevent a clear picture of binding. To address this limitation and test the impact of ion&#8208;ion interactions across multiple solvents, we quantified chloride binding to a cationic receptor after accounting for ion pairing. In these studies, we created a chelate receptor using aryl&#8208;triazole CH donors and a quinolinium that directs its cationic methyl inside the binding pocket. In low&#8208;polarity dichloromethane, the 1:1 complex (log&#160;K1:1&#160;~ 7.3) is more stable than neutral chelates, but fortuitously comparable to a preorganized macrocycle (log&#160;K1:1 ~ 6.9). Polar acetonitrile and DMSO diminish stabilities of the charged receptor (log&#160;K1:1&#160;~3.7 and 1.9) but surprisingly 100&#8208;fold more than the macrocycle. While both receptors lose stability by dielectric screening of electrostatic stability, the cationic receptor also pays additional costs of organization. Even though the charged and disorganized receptor has stronger binding in apolar solvents, the organized but uncharged receptor has more anion affinity in polar solvents.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomistic&#8208;level effects of noncovalent interactions and crystalline packing for organic material structural integrity upon exposure to gamma radiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing an atomistic understanding of ionizing radiation induced changes to organic materials is necessary for intentional design of greener and more sustainable materials for radiation shielding and detection. Cocrystals are promising for these purposes, but a detailed understanding of how the specific intermolecular interactions within the lattice upon exposure to radiation affect the structural stability of the organic crystalline material is unknown. Herein, we report the first study evaluating atomistic&#8208;level effects of &#947; radiation on both single&#8208; and multicomponent organic crystalline materials and how specific noncovalent interactions and packing within the crystalline lattice enhance structural stability. Dose studies were performed on all crystalline systems and evaluated via experimental and computational methods. Changes in crystallinity were evaluated by p&#8208;XRD and free radical formation was analyzed via EPR spectroscopy. Type of intermolecular interactions and packing within the crystal lattice was delineated and related to the specific free radical species formed and the structural integrity of each material. Periodic DFT and HOMO&#8208;LUMO surface mapping calculations provided atomistic&#8208;level identifications of the most probable sites for the radicals formed upon exposure to &#947; radiation and relate intermolecular interactions and molecular packing within the crystalline lattice to experimental results.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Partially Fluorinated Alkyl Triflates via Electrochemical Fluorination (Simons Process)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A scalable straightforward synthesis of monofluoro&#8208; and difluoro&#173;methyl &#173;triflate CF3SO2OCH2F (MH2F) and CF3SO2OCHF2&#160;(MHF2) via electrochemical fluorination (Simons process, ECF) of methyl triflate&#160;MH3&#160;in anhydrous hydrogen fluoride at nickel anodes is pre&#173;sent&#173;ed. The ECF method is also feasible for the preparation of the deuterated analogues CF3SO2OCD2F (MD2F) and CF3SO2OCDF2&#160;(MD2F). Surprisingly, no H/D exchange occurs during ECF of CF3SO2OCD3&#160;(MD3), which provides further evidence for a NiF3/NiF4&#8208;mediated ECF mechanism. The ECF of selected partially fluorinated ethyl triflates is described and electro&#173;chemical fluorination of CF3SO2&#173;O&#173;CH2CF3&#160;(EH2F3) leads to the so far unknown chiral CF3SO2&#173;OCHFCF3&#160;(EHFF3). The analogous fluoromethyl and fluoroethyl nonaflates are also accessible via ECF.

         <title>Photoisomerization of &#8220;Partially Embedded Dihydropyridazine&#8221; with a Helical Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis of two &#8220;partiallyembedded fused&#8208;dihydropyridazine N&#8208;aryl aza[5]helicene derivatives&#8221; (PDH) and the demonstration of their intrinsic photo&#8208;triggered multi&#8208;functional properties based on a Kekul&#233; biradical structure. Introducing bulky electron&#8208;withdrawing trifluoromethyl or pentafluoroethyl groups into the aza[5]helicene framework (PDH&#8208;CF3 and &#8208;C2F5) gives PDH axial chirality based on the helicity of the P and M forms, even at room temperature. Upon photo&#8208;irradiation of PDH&#8208;CF3 in a frozen solution, an ESR signal from the triplet biradical with zero&#8208;field splitting values, generated by N&#8211;N bond dissociation, was observed. However, when the irradiation was turned off, the ESR signal became silent, indicating the existence of two equilibriums, between the biradical and quinoidal forms based on the Kekul&#233; structure, and between N&#8211;N bond cleavage and recombination. The observed photo&#8208; and thermally induced behaviors indicate that T&#8208;type photochromic molecules are involved in the photoisomerization mechanism involving the two equilibriums. Inspired by the photoisomerization, chirality control of PDH by photoracemization was achieved. Multiple functionalities, such as T&#8208;type photochromism, photo&#8208;excitation&#8208;mediated triplet biradical formation, and photoracemization, which are attributed to the &#8220;partiallyembedded dihydropyridazine&#8221; structure, are demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>A Freestanding 3D Skeleton with Gradationally Distributed Lithiophilic Sites for Realizing Stable Lithium Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li metal anodes are drawing considerable attention owing to their ultrahigh theoretical capacities and low electrochemical reduction potentials. However, their commercialization has been hampered by safety hazards induced by continuous dendrite growth. These issues can be alleviated using the ZnO&#8208;modified 3D carbon&#8208;based host containing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and carbon felt (CF) fabricated by electroplating in the present study (denoted as ZnO/CNT@CF); the constructed skeleton has lithiophilic ZnO that is gradationally distributed along its thickness. The utilization of an inverted ZnO/CNT@CF&#8208;Li anode obtained by flipping over the carbon skeleton after Li electrodeposition is also reported herein. The synergistic effect of the Li metal and lithiophilic sites reduces the nucleation overpotential, thus inducing Li+ to preferentially deposit inside the porous carbon&#8208;based scaffold. The composite electrode compels Li to grow away from the separator, thereby significantly improving battery safety. A symmetric cell with the inverted ZnO/CNT@CF&#8208;Li electrode operates steadily for 700 cycles at 1 mA cm&#8722;2 and 1 mAh cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the ZnO/CNT@CF&#8208;Li|S cell exhibits an initial areal capacity of 10.9 mAh cm&#8722;2 at a S loading of 10.4 mg cm&#8722;2 and maintains a capacity of 3.0 mAh cm&#8722;2 after 320 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of In&#8208;Droplet Multicellular Communities by Light&#8208;Induced Combinatorial DNA Barcoding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for labeling cells with microdroplet identifiers generated from a set of DNA&#8208;functionalized microbeads is demonstrated. By employing a combinatorial approach, in which combinations of DNA barcodes from randomly encapsulated multiple DNA&#8208;functionalized microbeads collectively serve as unique molecular identifiers, generating many unique identifiers becomes feasible. In microdroplets, DNA barcoding molecules released from microbeads tag cell membranes, which are then read by single&#8208;cell sequencing.







Abstract
A microdroplet co&#8208;culture system is useful for the parallel assessment of numerous possible cell&#8211;cell interactions by generating isolated subcommunities from a pool of heterogeneous cells. However, the integration of single&#8208;cell sequencing into such analysis has been limited due to the lack of effective molecular identifiers for each in&#8208;droplet subcommunity. Herein, we present a strategy for generating in&#8208;droplet subcommunity identifiers using DNA&#8208;functionalized microparticles encapsulated within microdroplets. These microparticles serve as initial information carriers, where their combinations act as distinct identifiers for in&#8208;droplet subcommunity. Upon optical trigger, DNA barcoding molecules encoding the microparticle information are once released in the microdroplets and then tag cell membranes. The tagged DNA molecules then serve as a second information carrier readable by single&#8208;cell sequencing to reconstitute the community in silico in the single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing data space.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A microdroplet co-culture system is useful for the parallel assessment of numerous possible cell&#8211;cell interactions by generating isolated subcommunities from a pool of heterogeneous cells. However, the integration of single-cell sequencing into such analysis has been limited due to the lack of effective molecular identifiers for each in-droplet subcommunity. Herein, we present a strategy for generating in-droplet subcommunity identifiers using DNA-functionalized microparticles encapsulated within microdroplets. These microparticles serve as initial information carriers, where their combinations act as distinct identifiers for in-droplet subcommunity. Upon optical trigger, DNA barcoding molecules encoding the microparticle information are once released in the microdroplets and then tag cell membranes. The tagged DNA molecules then serve as a second information carrier readable by single-cell sequencing to reconstitute the community in silico in the single-cell RNA sequencing data space.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Electrochemical Reduction of Disulfides in an Undivided Cell under Mass Transfer Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electroorganic synthesis is generally considered to be a green alternative to conventional redox reactions. Electrochemical reductions, however, are less advantageous in terms of sustainability, as sacrificial metal anodes are often employed. Divided cell operation avoids contact of the reduction products with the anode and allows for convenient solvent oxidation, enabling metal free greener electrochemical reductions. However, the ion exchange membranes required for divided cell operation on a commercial scale are not amenable to organic solvents, which hinders their applicability. Herein, we demonstrate that electrochemical reduction of oxidatively sensitive compounds can be carried out in an undivided cell without sacrificial metal anodes by controlling the mass transport to a small surface area electrode. The concept is showcased by an electrochemical method for the reductive cleavage of aryl disulfides. Fine tuning of the electrode surface area and current density has enabled the preparation of a wide variety of thiols without formation of any oxidation side products. This strategy is anticipated to encourage further research on greener, metal free electrochemical reductions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Chlorination of CS2 leads to trichloromethanesulfenyl chloride, Cl3CSCl, in moderate yields. The oxidation of Cl3CSCl with H2O2 gives Cl3CSO2Cl, the chloride of trichloromethanesulfonic acid.

         <title>Construction of [NbO]6&#8208;x&#8208;xS structure to change charge density and regulate spontaneous polarization to achieve efficient pyro&#8208;photo&#8208;electric water splitting system of NaNbO3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyroelectric materials in the field of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting still face the problems of difficult low spontaneous polarization intensity and excessive carrier recombination. Based on the above problems, we altered the interaction between S&#8208;Nb&#8208;S in the [NbO]6&#8208;x&#8208;xS structure, and the constructed [NbO]6&#8208;x&#8208;xS structure achieved the regulation of charge density change and spontaneous polarization. The results show that under the stimulation of light and temperature fluctuations, the current density of the NS&#8208;4 photoanode is as high as 0.574 mA/cm2 at 1.23 VRHE, which is about 1.59 times higher than the pure NaNbO3 current density value, and the NS &#8208;4 photoanode achieves IPCE value of 16.08%. The first&#8208;principles density&#8208;functional theory calculations (DFT) reveal the principle of the [NbO]6&#8208;x&#8208;xS structure for the suppression function of the carrier recombination and the improvement function of the pyroelectric effect. The analysis shows that the S&#8208;doping leads to the weakening of S&#8208;Nb&#8208;S interactions in the [NbO]6&#8208;x&#8208;xS structure, which improves the pyroelectric effect and suppresses the photo/pyro&#8208;generated carrier recombination, and effectively enhances the performance of the pyro&#8208;photo&#8208;electric synergistic water splitting system. This work promotes the development of pyroelectric materials in the field of photoelectrochemical water splitting.</dc:description>

         <title>Temperature Directs the Majority&#8208;Rules Principle in Supramolecular Copolymers Driven by Triazine&#8211;Benzene Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular copolymerization of chiral comonomers into helical assemblies can introduce competing polymerization pathways. Temperature can be used to control the composition of triazine&#8208; and benzene&#8208;based copolymers and thereby invert the helical screw&#8208;sense of the assemblies. By combining spectroscopy with computations, the authors show that the temperature&#8208;dependent helical structure originates from the copolymerization mechanism.







Abstract
Supramolecular copolymers have typically been studied in the extreme cases, such as self&#8208;sorting or highly mixed copolymer systems, while the intermediate systems have been less understood. We have reported the temperature&#8208;dependent microstructure in copolymers of triazine&#8208; and benzene&#8208;derivatives based on charge&#8208;transfer interactions with a highly alternating microstructure at low temperatures. Here, we investigate the temperature&#8208;dependent copolymerization further and increase the complexity by combining triazine&#8208; and benzene&#8208;derivatives with opposite preferred helicities. In this case, intercalation of the benzene&#8208;derivative into the triazine&#8208;derivative assemblies causes a helical inversion. The inversion of the net helicity was rationalized by comparing the mismatch penalties of the individual monomers, which indicated that the benzene&#8208;derivative dictates the helical screw&#8208;sense of the supramolecular copolymers. Surprisingly, this was not reflected in further investigations of slightly modified triazine&#8208; and benzene&#8208;derivatives, thus highlighting that the outcome is a subtle balance between structural features, where small differences can be amplified due to the competitive nature of the interactions. Overall, these findings suggest that the temperature&#8208;dependent microstructure of triazine&#8208; and benzene&#8208;based supramolecular copolymers determines the copolymer helicity of the presented system in a similar way as the mixed majority&#8208;rules phenomenon.

         <title>Phosphorus Dendrimers for Metal&#8208;Free Ligation: Design of Multivalent Pharmacological Chaperones against Gaucher Disease</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
First dendrimers built on a cyclotriphosphazene core and displaying 6 or 12&#8197;monofluorocyclooctyne units grafted onto their surface allowed the design of deoxynojirimycin clusters by copper&#8208;free click&#8208;chemistry ligation. The dendrimers proved to be potent &#946;&#8208;glucocerebrosidase inhibitors and behave as pharmacological chaperones in Gaucher disease cells. These dendrimers functionalized by monofluorocyclooctynes units may find numerous applications to prepare multivalent objects for biological purposes.







Abstract
The first phosphorus dendrimers built on a cyclotriphosphazene core and decorated with six or twelve monofluorocyclooctyne units were prepared. A simple stirring allowed the grafting of N&#8208;hexyl deoxynojirimycin inhitopes onto their surface by copper&#8208;free strain promoted alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition click reaction. The synthesized iminosugars clusters were tested as multivalent inhibitors of the biologically relevant enzymes &#946;&#8208;glucocerebrosidase and acid &#945;&#8208;glucosidase, involved in Gaucher and Pompe lysosomal storage diseases, respectively. For both enzymes, all the multivalent compounds were more potent than the reference N&#8208;hexyl deoxynojirimycin. Remarkably, the final dodecavalent compound proved to be one of the best &#946;&#8208;glucocerebrosidase inhibitors described to date. These cyclotriphosphazene&#8208;based deoxynojirimycin dendrimers were then evaluated as pharmacological chaperones against Gaucher disease. Not only did these multivalent constructs cross the cell membranes but they were also able to increase &#946;&#8208;glucocerebrosidase activity in Gaucher cells. Notably, dodecavalent compound allowed a 1.4&#8208;fold enzyme activity enhancement at a concentration as low as 100&#8197;nM. These new monofluorocyclooctyne&#8208;presenting dendrimers may further find numerous applications in the synthesis of multivalent objects for biological and pharmacological purposes.

         <title>Sequential Water Sorption/Desorption of a Nonporous Adaptive Organic Ligand Bridged Coordination Polymer for Atmospheric Moisture Harvesting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nonporous anionic coordination polymer of uranyl squarate with methyl viologen as charge balancing ions that displays sequential water sorption/desorption has shown its potential in application for atmospheric water harvesting.







Abstract
Moisture harvesters with favourable attributes such as easy synthetic availability and good processability as alternatives for atmospheric moisture harvesting (AWH) are desirable. This study reports a novel nonporous anionic coordination polymer (CP) of uranyl squarate with methyl viologen (MV2+) as charge balancing ions (named U&#8208;Squ&#8208;CP) which displays intriguing sequential water sorption/desorption behavior as the relative humidity (RH) changes gradually. The evaluation of AWH performance of U&#8208;Squ&#8208;CP shows that it can absorb water vapor under air atmosphere at a low RH of 20&#8201;% typical of the levels found in most dry regions of the world, and have good cycling durability, thus demonstrating the capability as a potential moisture harvester for AWH. To the authors&#8217; knowledge, this is the first report on non&#8208;porous organic ligand bridged CP materials for AWH. Moreover, a stepwise water&#8208;filling mechanism for the water sorption/desorption process is deciphered by comprehensive characterizations combining single&#8208;crystal diffraction, which provides a reasonable explanation for the special moisture harvesting behaviour of this non&#8208;porous crystalline material.

         <title>Mechanistic Aspects of the Crabtree&#8208;Pfaltz Hydrogenation of Olefins &#8208; An Interplay of Experimentation and Quantum Chemical Computation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic hydrogenation of unfunctionalized, highly substituted olefins once was a difficult task that was solved by Crabtree with his iridium catalyst that was further improved by Pfaltz and others. Mechanistic aspects of this type of reactions have been elucidated by an interplay of experiment and quantum chemical calculations; nevertheless, open questions exist, which require further effort particularly by theoretical chemists.







Abstract
Introduction of Crabtree's iridium&#8208;based hydrogenation catalyst in 1977 marked a paradigm shift both with respect to the role of iridium in homogeneous catalysis as well as catalytic hydrogenation of olefins. In 1998, Pfaltz introduced an improved catalyst, by use of BARF&#8722; as anion, and established the first chiral variant of the Crabtree catalyst. This led to numerous practical highly enantioselective syntheses. Elucidation of mechanistic details posed great problems because of instability of the crucial intermediates. A remarkable breakthrough was achieved by Brandt, Andersson et&#8197;al. in 2003, based on dft calculations. These authors replaced a previously assumed IrI/IrIII catalytic cycle by a novel IrIII/IrV cycle. The proposal was experimentally verified by Pfaltz in 2014 and corroborated by advanced quantum chemical calculations. This essay is an attempt to describe a fascinating interplay of experiments and quantum chemical calculations for an important synthetic method.

         <title>Fluorinated Mn(III)/(II)&#8208;Porphyrin with Redox&#8208;Responsive 1H and 19F Relaxation Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new fluorinated manganese porphyrin, (Mn&#8208;TPP&#8208;p&#8208;CF3) is reported that is capable of providing, based on the Mn(III)/Mn(II) equilibrium, dual 1H relaxivity and a 19F&#8197;NMR response to redox changes. The reduction of Mn(III)&#8208;TPP&#8208;p&#8208;CF3 in the presence of ascorbic acid is slowly but fully reversed in the presence of air oxygen, as monitored by UV&#8208;Vis spectrometry and 19F&#8197;NMR. Phantom 19F MR images in DMSO show a MRI signal intensity decrease upon reduction of Mn(III)&#8208;TPP&#8208;p&#8208;CF3, retrieved upon complete reoxidation in air within ~24&#8197;h. 1H&#8197;NMRD curves of the Mn(III)/(II)&#8208;TPP&#8208;p&#8208;CF3 chelates in mixed DMSO/water solvent have the typical shape of Mn(II)/Mn(III) porphyrins.







Abstract
A new fluorinated manganese porphyrin, (Mn&#8208;TPP&#8208;p&#8208;CF3) is reported capable of providing, based on the Mn(III)/Mn(II) equilibrium, dual 1H relaxivity and 19F&#8197;NMR response to redox changes. The physical&#8208;chemical characterization of both redox states in DMSO&#8208;d6/H2O evidenced that the 1H relaxometric and 19F&#8197;NMR properties are appropriate for differential redox MRI detection. The Mn(III)&#8208;F distance (dMn&#8722;F=9.7&#8211;10&#8197;&#197;), as assessed by DFT calculations, is well tailored to allow for adequate paramagnetic effect of Mn(III) on 19F T1 and T2 relaxation times. Mn&#8208;TPP&#8208;p&#8208;CF3 has a reversible Mn(II)/Mn(III) redox potential of 0.574&#8197;V vs. NHE in deoxygenated aqueous HEPES/ THF solution. The reduction of Mn(III)&#8208;TPP&#8208;p&#8208;CF3 in the presence of ascorbic acid is slowly, but fully reversed in the presence of air oxygen, as monitored by UV&#8208;Vis spectrometry and 19F&#8197;NMR. The broad 1H and 19F&#8197;NMR signals of Mn(III)&#8208;TPP&#8208;p&#8208;CF3 disappear in the presence of 1&#8197;equivalent ascorbate replaced by a shifted and broadened 19F&#8197;NMR signal from Mn(II)&#8208;TPP&#8208;p&#8208;CF3. Phantom 19F MR images in DMSO show a MRI signal intensity decrease upon reduction of Mn(III)&#8208;TPP&#8208;p&#8208;CF3, retrieved upon complete reoxidation in air within ~24&#8197;h. 1H&#8197;NMRD curves of the Mn(III)/(II)&#8208;TPP&#8208;p&#8208;CF3 chelates in mixed DMSO/water solvent have the typical shape of Mn(II)/Mn(III) porphyrins.

The reduction of Mn(III)-TPP-&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in the presence of ascorbic acid is slowly, but fully reversed in the presence of air oxygen, as monitored by UV-Vis spectrometry and &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F&#8197;NMR. The broad &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H and &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F&#8197;NMR signals of Mn(III)-TPP-&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; disappear in the presence of 1&#8197;equivalent ascorbate replaced by a shifted and broadened &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F&#8197;NMR signal from Mn(II)-TPP-&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

         <title>Iso&#8208;Pentadienyl Carbonate as a Five Carbon Synthon in Manganese(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Linear 1,3&#8208;Dienylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the realm of chemical synthesis, a child envisioned an adventurous journey of manganese(I) catalysis full of obstacles, like the distant howls of wolves echoing through the night, with the ultimate goal of finding a general route to discover a linear, selective C&#8722;H dienylation method that leads to electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor dienes, glycoconjugates, and unnatural amino acids. The synthetic application of this method is also eased to deliver the tricyclic core of Nagilactone. More information can be found in the Research Article by P. Subramanian and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301632).

         <title>Synthetic Strategies of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Olefin (NHOs) and Their Recent Application of Organocatalytic Reactions and Beyond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (NHOs) derivatives have an electron&#8208;rich as well as highly polarized carabon&#8208;carbon (C=C) double bond because of the electron&#8208;donating nature of nitrogen and sulphur atoms. While NHOs have been developing as novel organocatalysts and ligands for transition metal complexes in various organic compound syntheses, different research groups are currently interested in preparing imidazole and triazolium&#8208;based chiral NHO catalysts. Some of them have been used for enantioselective organic transformations, but were still elusive. N&#8208;Heterocyclic Olefins, the alkylidene derivatives of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHC) have shown promising results as effective promoters for numerous organic syntheses such as asymmetric catalysis, hydroborylation, hydrosilylation, reduction, CO2 sequestration, alkylation, cycloaddition, polymerization and the ring&#8208;opening reaction of aziridine and epoxides, esterification, C&#8208;F bond functionalization, amine coupling, trifluoromethyl thiolation, amination etc. NHOs catalysts with suitable structure can serve as a novel class of Lewis/Bronsted bases with strong basicity and high nucleophilicity properties. These facts strongly suggest their enormous chemical potential as sustainable catalysts for a wide variety of reactions in synthetic chemistry. The synthesis of NHOs and their properties are briefly reviewed in this article, along with a summary of the imidazole and triazole core of NHOs' most recent catalytic uses.</dc:description>

         <title>Function&#8208;led Design of Covalent&#8208;Organic&#8208;Framework Membranes for Precise Ion Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Insufficient access to clean water and resources has emerged as one of the most pressing issues affecting people globally. Membrane&#8208;based ion separation has become a focal point of research for the generation of fresh water and the extraction of energy elements. This review encapsulates recent advancements in the selective ion transport of covalent organic framework (COF) membranes, accomplished by strategically pairing diverse monomers to create membranes with various pore sizes and environments for specific purposes. We first discuss the merits of using COF materials as a basis for fabricating membranes for ion separation. We then explore the development of COF membranes in areas such as desalination, acid recovery, and energy element extraction, with a particular emphasis on the fundamental principles of membrane design. Lastly, we address both theoretical and practical challenges, as well as potential opportunities in the targeted design of ion&#8208;selective membranes. The goal of this review is to stimulate future investigative efforts in this field, which is of significant scientific and strategic importance.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon Nitrides from Supramolecular Crystals: From Single Atoms to Heterojunctions and Advanced Photoelectrodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon nitride materials (CN) have become within the last 15 years in one of the most studied photocataysts. While CN absorbs visible light, its low porosity and fast electron &#8211; hole recombination hinder its photoelectric performance and have motivated the research in the modification of its physical and chemical properties (such as energy band structure, porosity, or chemical composition) by different means. In this perspective we focus on the utilization of supramolecular crystals as CN precursors to tailor its properties. We elaborate on the features needed in a supramolecular crystal to serve as CN precursor, we delve on the influence of metal&#8208;free crystals in the morphology and porosity of the resulting materials and then discuss the formation of single atoms and heterojunctions when employing a metal&#8208;organic crystal. We finally discuss the performance of CN photoanodes derived from crystals and highlight the current standing challenges in the field.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular syringe for cargo photorelease &#8208; red&#8208;light&#8208;triggered supramolecular hydrogel</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photochromic supramolecular hydrogels are versatile materials that elicit macroscopic effects upon irradiation, like liquefaction or shape changes. Here we demonstrate a simple photochromic cyclic dipeptide (2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine&#8208;based) supergelator composed of (S)&#8208;lysine and an azobenzene analogue of phenylalanine, which forms supramolecular hydrogels already at 0.1&#160;wt% loading. The gels can physically encapsulate cargo molecules and release them to the environment in a controllable manner upon irradiation with red light, working as a &#8220;molecular syringe&#8221;. As the material is biocompatible and operational in the &#8220;therapeutic window&#8221; of light (&gt;650&#160;nm) that deeply penetrates soft human tissues, it is applicable for smart drug delivery systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular Through&#8208;Space Double&#8208;Electron Transfer Between A Pair of Redox&#8208;Active Guanidine Units Aligned by Dithiolate Bridges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using unconventional synthesis protocols, two redox&#8208;active triguanidine units are connected by a dithiolate bridge, aligning the two redox&#8208;active units in close proximity . The reduced, neutral and the tetracationic redox states with two dicationic triguanidine units are isolated and fully characterized, Then, the dicationic redox states are prepared by mixing the neutral and tetracationic molecules. At low temperatures, the dications are diamagnetic (singlet ground state) with two different triguanidine units (neutral and dicationic). At room temperature, the triplet state with two radical monocationic triguanidine units is populated. At low temperature (210 K), chemical exchange by intramolecular through&#8208;space electron&#8208;transfer between the two triguanidine units is evidenced by EXSY NMR spectroscopy. Intramolecular through&#8208;space transfer of two electrons from the neutral to the dicationic triguanidine unit is accompanied by migration of the couterions in opposite direction. The rate of double&#8208;electron transfer critically depends on the bridge. No electron&#8208;transfer is measured in the absence of a bridge (in a mixture of one dicationic and one neutral triguanidine), and relatively slow electron transfer if the bridge does not allow the two triguanidine units to approach each other close enough. The results give detailed, quantitative insight into the factors that influence intramolecular through&#8208;space double&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Unprotected Indolines Through Intramolecular sp3 C&#8722;H Amination Using Nitroarenes as Aryl Nitrene Precursors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free intramolecular benzylic sp3 C&#8722;H amination is disclosed using aryl nitro compounds as aryl nitrene precursors. Organosilicon reagent N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis(trimethylsilyl)&#8208;4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridinylidene (Si&#8208;DHBP) served as an efficient reductant in the transformation, enabling the in&#8197;situ generation of aryl nitrene species for the synthesis of 2&#8208;arylindolines from the corresponding nitroarene compounds.







Abstract
Given the prevalence of molecules containing nitro groups in organic synthesis, innovative methods to expand the reactivity of this functional group are of interest in both industrial and academic settings. In this report, a metal&#8208;free intramolecular benzylic sp3 C&#8722;H amination is disclosed using aryl nitro compounds as aryl nitrene precursors. Organosilicon reagent N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis(trimethylsilyl)&#8208;4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridinylidene (Si&#8208;DHBP) served as an efficient reductant in the transformation, enabling the in&#8197;situ generation of aryl nitrene species for the direct, metal&#8208;free synthesis of unprotected 2&#8208;arylindolines from the corresponding nitroarene compounds.

         <title>Trityl&#8208;Based Lanthanide&#8208;Supramolecular Assemblies Exhibiting Slow Magnetic Relaxation</title>

Magneto&#8208;structural correlations within the phenoxo&#8208;hydrazone scaffolded lanthanide dimers lead to first example of trityl&#8208;governed zero field Ln&#8208;SMMs







Abstract
The triphenylmethane (trityl) group has been recognized as a supramolecular synthon in crystal engineering, molecular machine rotors and stereochemical chirality inductors in materials science. Herein we demonstrate for the first time how it can be utilized in the domain of molecular magnetic materials through shaping of single molecule magnet (SMM) properties within the lanthanide complexes in tandem with other non&#8208;covalent interactions. Trityl&#8208;appended mono&#8208; (HL1) and bis&#8208;compartmental (HL2) hydrazone ligands were synthesized and complexated with Dy(III) and Er(III) triflate and nitrate salts to generate four monometallic (1&#8211;4) and two bimetallic (5, 6) complexes. The static and dynamic magnetic properties of 1&#8211;6 were investigated, revealing that only ligand HL1 induces assemblies (1&#8211;4) capable of showing SMM behaviour, with Dy(III) congeners (1, 2) able to exhibit the phenomenon also under zero field conditions. Theoretical ab initio studies helped in determination of Dy(III) energetic levels, magnetic anisotropic axes and corroborated magnetic relaxation mechanisms to be a combination of Raman and quantum tunnelling in zero dc field, the latter being cancelled in the optimum non&#8208;zero dc field. Our work represents the first study of magneto&#8208;structural correlations within the trityl Ln&#8208;SMMs, leading to generation of slowly relaxing zero&#8208;field dysprosium complexes within the hydrogen&#8208;bonded assemblies.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of New Type of Macrocyclic Architectures Used for Optoelectronic Materials and Supramolecular Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various macrocyclic architectures, ranging from the carbon&#8208;based macrocycles to the emerging heteroatom&#8208;doped macrocycles, have recently been established. This Minireview briefly overviews the latest advances in the design principle of macrocyclic systems as well as their applications in optoelectronic devices, supramolecular assembly and host&#8208;guest recognition.







Abstract
Supramolecular chemistry has received much attention for decades. Macrocyclic architectures as representative receptors play a vital role in supramolecular chemistry and are applied in many fields such as supramolecular assembly and host&#8208;guest recognition. However, the classical macrocycles generally lack functional groups in the scaffolds, which limit their further applications, especially in optoelectronic materials. Therefore, developing a new design principle is not only essential to better understand macrocyclic chemistry and the supramolecular behaviors, but also further expand their applications in many research fields. In recent years, the doping compounds with main&#8208;group heteroatoms (B, N, S, O, P) into the carbon&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;conjugated macrocycles offered a new strategy to build macrocyclic architectures with unique optoelectronic properties. In particular, the energy gaps and redox behavior can be effectively tuned by incorporating heteroatoms into the macrocyclic scaffolds. In this Minireview, we briefly summarize the design and synthesis of new macrocycles, and further discuss the related applications in optoelectronic materials and supramolecular chemistry.

         <dc:description>
Zero&#8208;linker ligand with no linker group is used in conjunction with metal ions that can maximize the size coordination efficiency and construct a stable ultra&#8208;microporous MOF framework, serving as a bridge between zeolites and traditional MOFs.







Abstract
Zero&#8208;linker ligands have maximized the size coordination efficiency of the metal ions in MOF framework which is important in constructing ultra&#8208;microporous MOFs with high stability and density, a bridge between zeolites and traditional MOFs. This article highlighted several recently developed ultra&#8208;microporous MOFs with zero&#8208;linker ligands for gas capture and separation.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Catalyzed para&#8208;Selective Sulfenyl Group Transfer Reactions of N&#8208;Sulfenylanilides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
para&#8208;Selective rearrangement reactions of N&#8208;sulfenylanilides were efficiently promoted by silver catalysts under mild reaction conditions. This reaction proceeds by an intermolecular transfer of the sulfenyl group.







Abstract
Silver&#8208;catalyzed reactions of N&#8208;sulfenylanilides afforded the corresponding p&#8208;sulfenylanilides in good to high yields with good para selectivity. The transformation has a high compatibility of functional groups, such as ester, bromo, and iodo groups. Mechanistic studies indicate that the rearrangement reaction proceeds through intermolecular transfer of the sulfenyl group.

         <title>Efficient Nitric Oxide Scavenging by Urea&#8208;Functionalized Push&#8208;Pull Chromophore Modulates NO&#8208;Mediated Diseases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The harmful effects of excess nitric oxide (NO) can be prevented by its scavenging. We show that a urea&#8208;functionalized molecule (Urea&#8208;eTCBD), rapidly binds to NO and forms a stable NONOate. The inhibition of NO&#8208;mediated, paw inflammation and corneal neovascularization by Urea&#8208;eTCBD, confirmed the biocompatibility and efficacy of the molecule. Additionally, Urea&#8208;eTCBD exhibited its potential for NO&#8208;sensing through a fluorescence turn&#8208;off mechanism.







Abstract
The excess nitric oxide (NO) produced in the body in response to bacterial/proinflammatory stimuli is responsible for several pathological conditions. The current approaches that target the production of excess NO, either through the inhibition of nitric oxide synthase enzyme or its downstream mediators have been clinically unsuccessful. With an aim to regulate the excess NO, urea&#8208;functionalized push&#8208;pull chromophores containing 1,1,4,4&#8208;tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes (TCBD) or expanded TCBD (eTCBD) were developed as NO scavengers. The NMR mechanistic studies revealed that upon NO binding, these molecules are converted to uncommon stable NONOates. The unique emissive property of Urea&#8208;eTCBD enables its application in&#8197;vitro, as a NO&#8208;sensor. Furthermore, the cytocompatible Urea&#8208;eTCBD, rapidly inactivated the NO released from LPS&#8208;activated cells. The therapeutic efficacy of the molecule in modulating NO&#8208;mediated pathological condition was confirmed using a carrageenan&#8208;induced inflammatory paw model and a corneal injury model. While the results confirm the advantages of scavenging the excess NO to address a multitude of NO&#8208;mediated diseases, the promising sensing and bioactivity of Urea&#8208;eTCBD can motivate further exploration of such molecules in allied areas of research.

         <title>Critical Issues of Vanadium&#8208;Based Cathodes Towards Practical Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review aims to provide an overview of the key obstacles encountered by vanadium&#8208;based cathodes toward practical aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries, encompassing dissolution, by&#8208;product formation, and limited ion diffusion. Additionally, it highlights the latest advancements made in tackling these challenges and proposes potential directions for future research in this domain.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are gaining significant attention for their numerous advantages, including high safety, high energy density, affordability, and environmental friendliness. However, the development of ZIBs has been hampered by the lack of suitable cathode materials that can store Zn2+ with high capacity and reversibility. Currently, vanadium&#8208;based materials with tunnel or layered structures are widely researched owing to their high theoretical capacity and diversified structures. However, their long&#8208;term cycling stability is unsatisfactory because of material dissolution, phase transformation, and restrictive kinetics in aqueous electrolytes, which limits their practical applications. Different from previous reviews on ZIBs, this review specifically addresses the critical issues faced by vanadium&#8208;based cathodes for practical aqueous ZIBs and proposes potential solutions. Focusing on vanadium&#8208;based cathodes, their ion storage mechanisms, the critical parameters affecting their performance, and the progress made in addressing the aforementioned problems are also summarized. Finally, future directions for the development of practical aqueous ZIB are suggested.

         <title>Gas Permeation through Mechanically Resistant Self&#8208;Standing Membranes of a Neat Amorphous Organic Cage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stand up and be tested: Self&#8208;standing membranes of a neat organic cage are reported here. The cage membranes showed a remarkably good mechanical resistance, which made them suitable for gas&#8208;permeation tests. This study pointed the possibility of using a simple organic cage molecule to achieve a molecular material with features that are generally observed with polymeric membranes.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of a novel film&#8208;forming organic cage and of its smaller analogue are here described. While the small cage produced single crystals suitable for X&#8208;ray diffraction studies, the large one was isolated as a dense film. Due to its remarkable film&#8208;forming properties, this latter cage could be solution processed into transparent thin&#8208;layer films and mechanically stable dense self&#8208;standing membranes of controllable thickness. Thanks to these peculiar features, the membranes were also successfully tested for gas permeation, reporting a behavior similar to that found with stiff glassy polymers such as polymers of intrinsic microporosity or polyimides. Given the growing interest in the development of molecular&#8208;based membranes, for example for separation technologies and functional coatings, the properties of this organic cage were investigated by thorough analysis of their structural, thermal, mechanical and gas transport properties, and by detailed atomistic simulations.

By the combination of an Ugi&#8208;4CR and a transition metal&#8208;free selective N&#8722;S bond cleavage and C&#8722;N bond activation, diverse primary amides and &#945;&#8208;ketoamides were simultaneously obtained in a highly efficient, rapid, and step&#8208;economical manner. The reaction features broad substrate scope, excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance, and exclusive selectivity. Primary amides derived from the pharmaceuticals probenecid and febuxostat are also prepared.







Abstract
A novel method of transition metal&#8208;free N&#8722;S bond cleavage and subsequent C&#8722;N bond activation of Ugi&#8208;adducts was developed. Diverse primary amides and &#945;&#8208;ketoamides were prepared in a rapid, step&#8208;economical and highly efficient manner in two steps. This strategy features excellent chemoselectivity, high yield and functional&#8208;group tolerance. Primary amides derived from the pharmaceuticals probenecid and febuxostat were prepared. This method opens a new pathway for the simultaneous synthesis of primary amides and &#945;&#8208;ketoamides in an environmentally friendly manner.

Functionalized triose&#8208;, furanose and chromane&#8208;derivatives were synthesized by the titled reactions. The C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming cascade processes generate a functionalized sugar derivative with a quaternary stereocenter in a highly enantioselective fashion (up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8201;ee) by using a simple combination of metal and chiral amine co&#8208;catalysts.

         <title>Factors Controlling Complex Morphologies of Isomorphous Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks

The unique double&#8208;decker flower morphology is combined with homochirality and single crystallinity. A series of isomorphous crystals have been demonstrated and the flower&#8208;like morphology originates from the &#8216;stellate&#8217; intermediate.







Abstract
We demonstrate here how nitrate salts of bivalent copper, nickel, cobalt, and manganese, along with an achiral organic ligand, assemble into various structures such as symmetrical double&#8208;decker flowers, smooth elongated hexagonal bipyramids, and hexagonal prisms. Large morphological changes occur in these structures because of different metal cations, although they maintain isomorphous hexagonal crystallographic structures. Metal cations with stronger coordination to ligands (Cu and Ni) tend to form uniform crystals with unusual shapes, whereas weaker coordinating metal cations (Mn and Co) produce crystals with more regular hexagonal morphologies. The unusual flower&#8208;like crystals formed with copper nitrate have two pairs of six symmetrical petals with hexagonal convex centers. The texture of the petals indicates dendritic growth. Two different types of morphologies were formed by using different copper nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ligand ratios. An excess of the metal salt results in uniform and hexagonal crystals having a narrow size distribution, whereas the use of an excess of ligand results in double&#8208;decker morphologies. Mechanistically, an intermediate structure was observed with slightly concave facets and a domed center. Such structures most likely play a key role in the formation of double&#8208;decker crystals that can be formed by fusion processes. The coordination chemistry results in isostructural chiral frameworks consisting of two types of continuous helical channels. Four pyridine units from four separate ligands are coordinated to the metal center in a plane having a chiral (propeller&#8208;type) arrangement. The individual double&#8208;decker flower crystals are homochiral and a batch consists of crystals having both handedness.

         <title>Antimalarial Agents Derived from Metal&#8208;Amodiaquine Complexes with Activity in Multiple Stages of the Plasmodium Life Cycle</title>

         <dc:description>
Metal conjugation has the potential to improve the speciation and cellular distribution of quinolines and subsequently broadening their spectrum of action as antimalarial drugs for multiple stages of the Plasmodium life cycle. Here, we provide an in&#8208;depth investigation of the chemistry and pharmacology of metal&#8208;quinoline complexes.







Abstract
Malaria is the one of the deadliest infectious diseases worldwide. Chemically, quinolines are excellent ligands for metal coordination and are deployed as drugs for malaria treatment. There is a growing body of evidence indicating that metal complexes can be conjugated with antimalarial quinolines to be used as chemical tools to overcome the disadvantages of quinolines, improving their bioactive speciation, cellular distribution, and subsequently broadening the spectrum of activity to multiple stages of the complex Plasmodium life cycle. In this study, four novel complexes of ruthenium(II)&#8208; and gold(I)&#8208;containing amodiaquine (AQ) were synthesized, and a careful chemical characterization revealed the precise coordination site of AQ to the metals. Their speciation in solution was investigated, demonstrating the stability of the quinoline&#8208;metal bond. RuII&#8208; and AuI&#8208;AQ complexes were demonstrated to be potent and efficacious in inhibiting parasite growth in multiple stages of the Plasmodium life cycle as assayed in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. These properties could be attributed to the ability of the metal&#8208;AQ complexes to reproduce the suppression of heme detoxification induced by AQ, while also inhibiting other processes in the parasite life cycle; this can be attributed to the action of the metallic species. Altogether, these findings indicate that metal coordination with antimalarial quinolines is a potential chemical tool for drug design and discovery in malaria and other infectious diseases susceptible to quinoline treatment.
