         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks based Lithium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries (LOBs) are considered as the next&#8208;generation energy technology owing to their high theoretical energy density. However, the sluggish cathode kinetics and degradation of Li anodes result in large voltage hysteresis and low coulombic efficiency. Various materials have been applied to promote the electrochemical performance of LOBs. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) possessing porous structures, open active sites and adjustable pore sizes are attempted as promising materials for catalysts and separators of LOBs. This concept presents an overview of different MOF&#8208;based catalysts for LOBs, including traditional, conductive, semi&#8208;conductive and soluble MOFs, as well as our recently proposed photoinvolved LOBs. Recent advances on the MOF&#8208;based separators have also been discussed to restrain the shuttling of redox mediators between cathodes and anodes and suppress formation of lithium dendrites. Perspectives on the development of MOF&#8208;based LOBs are presented for future research.</dc:description>

Visualization of cation dynamics inside living systems represent a major breakthrough at the crossroad of chemistry and cellular physiology. In this article, we bring up three emerging concepts in this field: 1)&#8197;Red&#8208;shifting cation indicators towards far&#8208;red and NIR channels; 2)&#8197;directing the sensors to various subcellular localizations; 3)&#8197;lowering the phototoxicity of sensors for long term recording. These initiatives collectively echo the advocate of 4D physiology, in which biological processes within living systems can be panoramically unveiled under 3D, long&#8208;term, and multi&#8208;channel imaging with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolutions.







Abstract
Visualization of cation dynamics inside a living system represent a major breakthrough at the crossroad of chemistry and cellular physiology. Since the inception of BAPTA&#8208;based cellular calcium indicators in the 1980s, generations of chemical and genetically encoded ion indicators spanning the visible spectrum have been developed. In this article, we bring up three emerging concepts in this field: 1.&#8197;red&#8208;shifting cation indicators towards far&#8208;red and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) channels; 2.&#8197;directing the indicators to various subcellular localizations; 3.&#8197;lowering the phototoxicity of indicators for long term recording. These initiatives collectively echo the advocate of 4D cellular physiology, where biological processes within living systems can be panoramically unveiled under 3D, long&#8208;term, and multi&#8208;channel imaging with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. This outlook poses exciting challenges and opportunities for chemists to upgrade the toolkit of fluorescent indicators as key enablers for a new era of imageomics.

         <title>Six&#8208;Step Continuous Flow Synthesis of Diclofenac Sodium via Cascade Etherification/Smiles Rearrangement Strategy: Tackling the Issues of Batch Processing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 45, August 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intensified six&#8208;step continuous flow synthesis of diclofenac sodium from aniline and chloroacetic acid was developed by using a challenging and unprecedented etherification/Smiles rearrangement cascade as the key step in two types of flow reactors. The total isolated yield of diclofenac sodium was up to 63&#8201;% with an average yield of above 90&#8201;% for each step within a total residence time of 205&#8197;min.







Abstract
Diclofenac sodium is a widely used nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug (NSAID) as over&#8208;the&#8208;counter (OTC) medication for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Herein, the development of an intensified six&#8208;step continuous flow synthesis of diclofenac sodium from commercially available aniline and chloroacetic acid is described. A challenging and unprecedented etherification/Smiles rearrangement cascade of 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;N&#8208;phenylacetamide and 2,6&#8208;dichlorophenol into hydroxyacetyldiphenylamine operated with the precise control of reaction conditions in continuous flow was realized as the key step in this multistep synthetic chemistry. The undesired amide hydrolysis in Smiles rearrangement was addressed and the extra installation of N&#8208;chloroacetyl group in current industrial batch mode was avoided. Diclofenac sodium was obtained in 63&#8201;% isolated yield with an average yield of above 90&#8201;% for each step in a total residence time of 205&#8197;min.

         <title>Donor Acceptor Complexes between the Chalcogen Fluorides SF2, SeF2, SeF4 and TeF4 and an N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 45, August 10, 2022. </description>

Donor&#8208;acceptor complexes between the carbene 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (IPr) and EF2 (E=S, Se) or EF4 (E=Se, Te) were conveniently synthesized. The compounds were structurally investigated by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and a suite of density functional theory (DFT) methods were employed in order to elucidate fine electronic details of the chemical environment around the central chalcogen atoms.







Abstract
The majority of binary chalcogen fluorides are fiercely reactive and extremely difficult to handle. Here, we show that access to crystalline donor&#8208;acceptor complexes between chalcogen difluorides (sulfur, selenium) and tetrafluorides (selenium, tellurium) with the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (IPr) is possible conveniently and safely without the need to generate the highly unstable EF2 (E=S, Se) or the very toxic and corrosive SeF4.

         <title>Binding, Release and Functionalization of Intact Pnictogen Tetrahedra Coordinated to Dicopper Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 45, August 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bridging MeCN ligand in the dicopper(I) complex [(DPFN)Cu2(&#956;,&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;1&#8208;MeCN)][X]2 (X=WCA) can easily be replaced by white phosphorus (P4) or yellow arsenic (As4) to yield [(DPFN)Cu2(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;E4)][X]2 (E=P, As). The coordinated intact E4 tetrahedra can be further selectively functionalized with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) and cyclic alkyl amino carbenes (CAACs) under cleavage of E&#8722;E bonds, while using a small and strong NHC leads to the release of the pnictogen tetrahedra as P4 and grey arsenic, respectively.







Abstract
The bridging MeCN ligand in the dicopper(I) complexes [(DPFN)Cu2(&#956;,&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;1&#8208;MeCN)][X]2 (X=weakly coordinating anion, NTf2 (1&#8201;a), FAl[OC6F10(C6F5)]3 (1&#8201;b), Al[OC(CF3)3]4 (1&#8201;c)) was replaced by white phosphorus (P4) or yellow arsenic (As4) to yield [(DPFN)Cu2(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;E4)][X]2 (E=P (2&#8201;a&#8211;c), As (3&#8201;a&#8211;c)). The molecular structures in the solid state reveal novel coordination modes for E4 tetrahedra bonded to coinage metal ions. Experimental data and quantum chemical computations provide information concerning perturbations to the bonding in coordinated E4 tetrahedra. Reactions with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) led to replacement of the E4 tetrahedra with release of P4 or As4 and formation of [(DPFN)Cu2(&#956;,&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;1&#8208;MeNHC)][X]2 (4&#8201;a,b) or to an opening of one E&#8722;E bond leading to an unusual E4 butterfly structural motif in [(DPFN)Cu2(&#956;,&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;1&#8208;E4DippNHC)][X]2 (E=P (5&#8201;a,b), E=As (6)). With a cyclic alkyl amino carbene (EtCAAC), cleavage of two As&#8722;As bonds was observed to give two isomers of [(DPFN)Cu2(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;As4EtCAAC)][X]2 (7&#8201;a,b) with an unusual As4&#8208;triangle+1 unit.

         <dc:description>
An efficient and mild reaction protocol for the decarbonylation of isocyanates using catalytic amounts of Lewis acidic boranes is described. The electronic nature and the position of the substituents (ortho/meta/para) bound to isocyanate controls the chain length and composition of the products.







Abstract
An efficient and mild reaction protocol for the decarbonylation of isocyanates has been developed using catalytic amounts of Lewis acidic boranes. The electronic nature (electron withdrawing, electron neutral, and electron donating) and the position of the substituents (ortho/meta/para) bound to isocyanate controls the chain length and composition of the products formed in the reaction. Detailed DFT studies were undertaken to account for the formation of the mono/di&#8208;carboxamidation products and benzoxazolone compounds.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Long Lived Luminescent Triplet Excited States in Cyclic (Alkyl)(amino)carbene Complexes of Zn(II) Halides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 45, August 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zinc(II) halide cAAC dimers undergo photochemically induced rearrangements in the triplet excited state, one of which involves rotation of one of the cAAC ligands giving an asymmetric dimeric structure at 77&#8197;K. Consequently, transformation of 3XCT/LE to purely 3LE states localized at the carbene lead to ultra&#8208;long lived phosphorescence (millisecond regime). At room temperature, further rearrangements are observed. Similar photoreactions occur in monomeric [ZnX2(cAAC)(MeCN)] complexes.







Abstract
The high element abundance and d10 electron configuration make ZnII&#8208;based compounds attractive candidates for the development of novel photoactive molecules. Although a large library of purely fluorescent compounds exists, emission involving triplet excited states is a rare phenomenon for zinc complexes. We have investigated the photophysical and &#8208;chemical properties of a series of dimeric and monomeric ZnII halide complexes bearing a cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (cAAC) as chromophore unit. Specifically, [(cAAC)XZn(&#956;&#8208;X)2ZnX(cAAC)] (X=Cl (1), Br (2), I (3)) and [ZnX2(cAAC)(NCMe)] (X=Br (4), I (5)) were isolated and fully characterized, showing intense visible light photoluminescence under UV irradiation at 297&#8197;K and fast photo&#8208;induced transformation. At 77&#8197;K, the compounds exhibit improved stability allowing to record ultra&#8208;long lifetimes in the millisecond regime. DFT/MRCI calculations confirm that the emission stems from 3XCT/LEcAAC states and indicate the phototransformation to be related to asymmetric distortion of the complexes by cAAC ligand rotation. This study enhances our understanding of the excited state properties for future development and application of new classes of ZnII phosphorescent complexes.

The isothermal compression of a plane&#8208;square nickel(II) bis(N,N&#8208;diethyldithiocarbamate) complex above 1.23&#8197;GPa leads to a phase transition. The clearly visible strain in the transition between phases &#945; and &#948; is associated with the exchange of the anagostic Ni&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C interaction donor from methylene to the methyl group and with the significantly increased contribution of thioureide form II in the resonance electronic structure of ligands present in phase &#948;.







Abstract
The pressure&#8208;induced transformation of plane&#8208;square complex nickel(II) bis(N,N&#8208;diethyldithiocarbamate) between its soft dithiocarbamate (form I) and thioureide (form II) mesomeres is coupled to the interchange of anagostic Ni&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C interactions from methylene to the methyl group, respectively. At 1.23&#8197;GPa, the clearly visible giant anomalous compressibility of the crystal reveals a potential&#8208;energy difference of 5.4&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 between the two complex forms. The structural and spectroscopic results, which are supported by quantum&#8208;mechanical calculations, connect this solid&#8208;state phase transition with the mesomeric transition, and this is accompanied by the conformational transformation of anagostic Ni&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C rearrangement and formation of the charge&#8208;assisted S&#8722;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C bond under pressure.

Playing domino: Cu&#8208;catalyzed radical/iminium domino strategy (RIDS) for the efficient synthesis of quaternary&#8208;carbon&#8208;containing &#947;&#8208;lactam&#8208;based multiheterocyclic structures. This strategy enables the efficient syntheses of highly congested &#947;&#8208;lactam&#8208;based multiheterocyclic structures possessing quaternary carbons.







Abstract
Cu&#8208;Catalyzed radical/iminium domino strategy (RIDS) for the efficient synthesis of quaternary&#8208;carbon&#8208;containing &#947;&#8208;lactam&#8208;based multiheterocyclic structures from &#945;&#8208;bromocarboxamides is reported. This domino reaction strategy enables the construction of multiheterocycles in one step. Mechanistic studies showed that two catalytically generated iminiums are likely to be key intermediates in the catalytic cycle. The developed method can be used in a chemoselective manner to produce multicyclic products in the reaction with ketones possessing two different carbonyls.

         <title>Dynamic Stereochemistry of a Biphenyl&#8208;Bisprolineamide Model Catalyst and its Imidazolidinone Intermediates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 45, August 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solvent&#8208;dependent dynamic stereochemistry of a biphenyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bisprolineamide is characterized by VCD spectroscopy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in&#8197;situ VCD spectroscopy enables the determination of the imidazolidinones without extensive NMR analysis. In combination with NMR reaction monitoring, even the absolute configuration of a minor imidazolidinone species can be determined.







Abstract
In this study, we characterize the dynamic stereochemistry of a biphenyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bis(proline amide) catalyst in chloroform and DMSO as representative weakly and strongly hydrogen bonding solvents. Using vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) based spectra calculations, we show that the preferred axial stereochemistry of the catalyst is determined by solute&#8208;solvent interactions. Explicitly considering solvation with DMSO molecules is found to be essential to correctly predict the conformational preferences of the catalyst. Furthermore, we investigate the stereochemistry of the corresponding enamines and imidazolidinones that are formed upon reaction with isovaleraldehyde. The enamines are found to rapidly convert to endo&#8208;imidazolidinones and the thermodynamically favored exo&#8208;imidazolidinones are formed only slowly. The present study demonstrates that the stereochemistry of these imidazolidinones can be deduced directly from the VCD spectra analysis without any further detailed analysis of NMR spectra. Hence, we herein exemplify the use of VCD spectroscopy for an in&#8197;situ characterization of intermediates relevant in asymmetric catalysts.

         <title>Dipyrromethane&#8208;Based PGeP Pincer Germyl Rhodium Complexes</title>

PGeP pincers: A family of germyl rhodium(I) PGeP pincer complexes has been prepared from a metal&#8208;free germylene based on a dipyrromethane scaffold functionalized with two phosphane sidearms. These complexes have shown a rich derivative chemistry both at the germanium (chloride substitutions) and rhodium atoms (ligand substitutions, oxidative additions), providing tetra&#8208;, penta&#8208; and hexacoordinate rhodium complexes, some of which are also active catalyst precursors (olefin hydroboration).







Abstract
A family of germyl rhodium complexes derived from the PGeP germylene 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bis(di&#8208;isopropylphosphanylmethyl)&#8208;5,5&#8217;&#8208;dimethyldipyrromethane&#8208;1,1&#8217;&#8208;diylgermanium(II), Ge(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2 (1), has been prepared. Germylene 1 reacted readily with [RhCl(PPh3)3] and [RhCl(cod)(PPh3)] (cod=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene) to give, in both cases, the PGeP&#8208;pincer chloridogermyl rhodium(I) derivative [Rh{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeCl(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}(PPh3)] (2). Similarly, the reaction of 1 with [RhCl(cod)(MeCN)] afforded [Rh{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeCl(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}(MeCN)] (3). The methoxidogermyl and methylgermyl rhodium(I) complexes [Rh{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeR(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}(PPh3)] (R=OMe, 4; Me, 5) were prepared by treating complex 2 with LiOMe and LiMe, respectively. Complex 5 readily reacted with CO to give the carbonyl rhodium(I) derivative [Rh{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeR(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}(CO)] (6), with HCl, HSnPh3 and Ph2S2 rendering the pentacoordinate methylgermyl rhodium(III) complexes [RhHX{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeMe(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}] (X=Cl, 7; SnPh3, 8) and [Rh(SPh)2{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeMe(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}] (9), respectively, and with H2 to give the hexacoordinate derivative [RhH2{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeMe(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}(PPh3)] (10). Complexes 3 and 5 are catalyst precursors for the hydroboration of styrene, 4&#8208;vinyltoluene and 4&#8208;vinylfluorobenzene with catecholborane under mild conditions.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of A Stable Extra&#8208;Large&#8208;Pore Zeolite with 15&#215;12&#215;12 Member&#8208;Ring Channels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 45, August 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore germanosilicate zeolite NUD&#8208;13 is synthesized by using an easily obtained 1,2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;3&#8208;propyl&#8208;benzimidazolium as organic structure&#8208;directing agents, which possesses a rare 15&#215;12&#215;12&#8208;ring pore system. The germanium in NUD&#8208;13 can be partially substituted by post&#8208;synthetic modifications to obtain stable high silica and acidic aluminosilicate zeolites.







Abstract
Extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore zeolites have great application potential in various industrial fields, such as oil refinery, fine chemicals and biomass processing. Herein, we report the synthesis of an extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore germanosilicate zeolite (named NUD&#8208;13) by using an easily obtained aromatic organic cation 1,2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;3&#8208;propyl&#8208;benzimidazolium as organic structure&#8208;directing agents. NUD&#8208;13 possesses a rare 15&#8208;member ring extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore channel intersecting with two elliptical 12&#8208;member ring channels, which is isostructural to germanosilicate zeolite GeZA synthesized by using triphenylsulfonium. The germanium in NUD&#8208;13 can be partially substituted by acid treatment to obtain stable high silica zeolite. In addition, aluminium is added into the framework of NUD&#8208;13 during the post&#8208;synthesis treatment process, which provides a foundation for catalytic application.

         <title>Carboxylate Catalyzed Isomerization of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;Unsaturated N&#8208;Acetylcysteamine Thioesters

The power of carboxylates: Simple carboxylate salts can rival strong amidine bases, such as DBU, in their catalytic power to isomerize &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated thioesters to corresponding conjugated &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated thioesters. The mechanism involves a rate&#8208;determining protonation step!







Abstract
We demonstrate herein the capacity of simple carboxylate salts &#8211; tetrametylammonium and tetramethylguanidinium pivalate &#8211; to act as catalysts in the isomerization of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated thioesters to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated thioesters. The carboxylate catalysts gave reaction rates comparable to those obtained with DBU, but with fewer side reactions. The reaction exhibits a normal secondary kinetic isotope effect (k1H/k1D=1.065&#177;0.026) with a &#946;,&#947;&#8208;deuterated substrate. Computational analysis of the mechanism provides a similar value (k1H/k1D=1.05) with a mechanism where &#947;&#8208;reprotonation of the enolate intermediate is rate determining.

Record resonance: An anionic seven&#8208;vertex siliconoid cluster with four unsubstituted silicon atoms and a record upfield 29Si NMR chemical shift at &#8722;413.9&#8197;ppm is described. It was analyzed by magnetically induced current&#8208;density calculations.







Abstract
The silanide [Si4{N(SiMe3)Dipp}3]&#8722; (1) transforms into the anionic siliconoid cluster [Si7{N(SiMe3)Dipp}3]&#8722; (2) with four unsubstituted silicon atoms as a contact ion pair with [K([18]crown&#8208;6)] in C6D6 at room temperature within five weeks. Anion 2 was investigated by natural population analysis and visualization of intrinsic atomic orbitals. Magnetically induced current&#8208;density calculations of 2 revealed two distinct strong diatropic vortices that sum up in one direction and create a strongly shielded apical silicon atom in 2.

         <title>Cyclic Disulfide Liposomes for Membrane Functionalization and Cellular Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 45, August 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Not just decoration: Cyclic disulfide lipids are reported that enable the convenient decoration of liposomal surfaces with functional molecules; this is demonstrated through biotinylation, which drives microplate immobilization. In addition, these lipids enhance cellular delivery when incorporated into liposomes, as evidenced by dose&#8208;dependent increases detected through fluorescence microscopy.







Abstract
Liposomes are effective therapeutic delivery nanocarriers due to their ability to encapsulate and enhance the pharmacokinetic properties of a wide range of therapeutics. Two primary areas in which improvement is needed for liposomal drug delivery is to enhance the ability to infiltrate cells and to facilitate derivatization of the liposome surface. Herein, we report a liposome platform incorporating a cyclic disulfide lipid (CDL) for the dual purpose of enhancing cell entry and functionalizing the liposome membrane through thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange. In order to accomplish this, CDL&#8208;1 and CDL&#8208;2, composed of lipoic acid (LA) or asparagusic acid (AA) appended to a lipid scaffold, were designed and synthesized. A fluorescence&#8208;based microplate immobilization assay was implemented to show that these compounds enable convenient membrane decoration through reaction with thiol&#8208;functionalized small molecules. Additionally, fluorescence microscopy experiments indicated dramatic enhancements in cellular delivery when CDLs were incorporated within liposomes. These results demonstrate that multifunctional CDLs serve as an exciting liposome system for surface decoration and enhanced cellular delivery.

         <title>Molecular Ln(III)&#8722;H&#8722;E(II) Linkages (Ln=Y, Lu; E=Ge, Sn, Pb)</title>

Reductive alkane elimination reacting the aryltin trihydride Ar*SnH3 with donor free alkyl complexes [Cp*2Ln(CH{SiMe3}2)] (Ln=Y, Lu) in the presence of diethyl methylamine gives access to Ln(III)&#8722;H&#8722;Sn(II) linkages. The respective germanium and lead entities can be generated via exchange of hydrido&#8208;bridged dimers [(Ar*EH)2] (E=Ge, Pb) and [(Cp*2Ln(&#956;&#8208;H)2] (Ln=Y, Lu). Lead derivatives [Cp*2Ln(&#956;&#8208;H)2PbAr*] engage in H/D&#8208;exchange in benzene&#8208;d6 at ambient temperature.







Abstract
Following the alkane&#8208;elimination route, the reaction between tetravalent aryl tintrihydride Ar*SnH3 and trivalent rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metallocene alkyls [Cp*2Ln(CH{SiMe3}2)] gave complexes [Cp*2Ln(&#956;&#8208;H)2SnAr*] implementing a low&#8208;valent tin hydride (Ln=Y, Lu; Ar*=2,6&#8208;Trip2C6H3, Trip=2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylphenyl). The homologous complexes of germanium and lead, [Cp*2Ln(&#956;&#8208;H)2EAr*] (E = Ge, Pb), were accessed via addition of low&#8208;valent [(Ar*EH)2] to the rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal hydrides [(Cp*2LnH)2]. The lead compounds [Cp*2Ln(&#956;&#8208;H)2PbAr*] exhibit H/D exchange in reactions with deuterated solvents or dihydrogen.

Multifunctional: Cyclic disulfide liposomes have been developed for the dual purposes of enhancing cellular delivery through reaction with cell&#8208;surface thiols and facilitating liposome functionalization. These liposomes are depicted in the form of beach balls being lofted at their target cells: a scene of a warm day at the beach for a summertime issue of Chemistry&#8212;A European Journal. More information can be found in the Research Article by M.&#8197;D. Best and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201164).

         <dc:description>
Three new trends in fluorescence bioimaging of divalent metal cations using small&#8208;molecule indicators have been highlighted in this concept article by Liu, Zhang and Chen on page&#8197;17ff: Red&#8208;shifted indicators dwelling in the under&#8208;used far&#8208;red and NIR channels for multiplexed imaging; hybrid indicators combining the superior optical properties of synthetic dyes and the targetability of proteins; and biocompatible indicators under strong illumination lights in long term recording. These trends fall in line with the new initiative of &#8220;4D cellular physiology&#8221; which marked a grand vision of biological research in the era of big data.

Go with the flow: A six&#8208;step, continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of diclofenac sodium from commercially available aniline and chloroacetic acid was realized in a desktop microchemical plant. Diclofenac sodium was obtained in 63&#8201;% overall yield in a total reaction time of 205&#8197;min, with an average yield of above 90&#8201;% for each step. More information can be found in the Research Article by D. Cheng, F. Chen, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201420).

         <title>Azobenzene&#8208;based photochromic delivery vehicles for ions and small molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular switches have been used as delivery vehicles for various species. The ones that reversibly operate with light are arguably the best candidates for the purpose as they can be operated using light. The two states of these photoswitchable systems often possess remarkable differences in terms of their structural features and electronic properties. Photochromic systems with the appropriate embellishment of functionalities at suitable positions have thus been used as photoresponsive receptors. The use of light&#8208;driven alterations of the structural features has led to differential molecular recognition with these switchable host molecules. In this article, we discuss the use of such supramolecular systems as the delivery vehicles for ions and molecules that started with the pioneering work by Shinkai back in 1979. This review will explicitly cover the development from 2001 to 2022 with some past background and the future prospect of the field</dc:description>

         <title>Unravelling Enzymatic Features in a Supramolecular Iridium Catalyst by Computational Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computational calculations aiming at elucidating the reaction mechanism of a supramolecular iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond borylation enabled the identification of unique intermediates and transition states similar to those found in enzyme catalysis. The unexpected energies associated to the elementary steps are reached thanks to the relevant distortion effects at play, which are upgraded by the molecular&#8208;recognition pocket from the catalyst.







Abstract
Non&#8208;biological catalysts following the governing principles of enzymes are attractive systems to disclose unprecedented reactivities. Most of those existing catalysts feature an adaptable molecular recognition site for substrate binding that are prone to undergo conformational selection pathways. Herein, we present a non&#8208;biological catalyst that is able to bind substrates via the induced fit model according to in&#8208;depth computational calculations. The system, which is constituted by an inflexible substrate&#8208;recognition site derived from a zinc&#8208;porphyrin in the second coordination sphere, features destabilization of ground states as well as stabilization of transition states for the relevant iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond borylation of pyridine. In addition, this catalyst appears to be most suited to tightly bind the transition state rather than the substrate. Besides these features, which are reminiscent of the action modes of enzymes, new elementary catalytic steps (i.&#8201;e. C&#8722;B bond formation and catalyst regeneration) have been disclosed owing to the unique distortions encountered in the different intermediates and transition states.

         <title>Competing C&#8208;4 and C&#8208;5&#8208;Acyl Stabilization of Uronic Acid Glycosyl Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Uronic acids are carbohydrates carrying a terminal carboxylic acid and have a unique reactivity in stereoselective glycosylation reactions. Here, we study the competing intramolecular stabilization of uronic acid cations by the C&#8208;5 carboxylate ester or the C&#8208;4 acetyl group with infrared ion spectroscopy (IRIS). IRIS has revealed that a mixture of bridged ions is formed, where the mixture is driven towards the C&#8208;1,C&#8208;5 dioxolanium ion when the C&#8208;5,C&#8208;2&#8208;relationship is  cis  and towards the formation of the C&#8208;1,C&#8208;4 dioxepanium ion when this relation is  trans  . Isomer population analysis and interconversion barrier computations showed that the two conformations were not in dynamic equilibrium and that the ratio paralleled the density functional theory computed stability of the conformers. These studies reveal how the intrinsic interplay of the different functional groups influences the formation of the different regioisomeric products.</dc:description>

         <title>High performance Bifunctional Electrocatalysts  Designed  Based on Transition Metal Sulfides for Rechargeable Zn&#8208;air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the energy crisis by the excessive consumption of fossil fuels,   Zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs)  with high theoretical energy density have attracted people's attention.  The overall performance of ZABs is largely determined by the air cathode catalyst  . Therefore, it is necessary to develop high&#8208;efficiency and low&#8208;cost bifunctional catalysts to replace noble metal catalysts to promote the development of ZABs. Among a variety of cathode catalysts, TMS has become a research hotspot in recent years because of its better electrical conductivity than metal phosphides and metal oxides. In this work, we focus on the means of improving the electrocatalytic performance of  transition metal sulfides (TMS)  providing ideas for us to rationally design high&#8208;performance catalysts. Furthermore, the performance improvement law between catalyst performance and ZABs is also discussed in this work. Finally, some challenges and opportunities faced in the research of TMS electrocatalysis are briefly proposed, and strategies for improving the performance of ZABs are prospected.</dc:description>

         <title>Capturing a Pentacyclic Fragment&#8208;Based Library Derived from Perophoramidine: Their Design, Synthesis and Evaluation as Anticancer Compounds via DNA Double&#8208;Strand Breaks (DSB) and PARP&#8208;1 Inhibition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we have reported the discovery of a pentacyclic building block comprised of fused indole&#8208;quinoline and piperidinone from the natural product perophoramidine as a formidable anticancer agent. The compounds were synthesized in six steps where the key steps involved a blue LED mediated intramolecular cyclopropanation of the indole intermediates and concomitant reduction of the associated aryl nitro moiety to nitroso in the molecule. Cytotoxicity screening of the compounds against an array of cancer cells  i.e  ., MCF7, HCT116 and A549 demonstrated 0.6 to 9 microM IC  50  s by few of the compounds. gammaH2AX immunofluorescence assay of the two most potent molecules from the phenotypic screening with anti&#8208;g&#8208;H2AX Alexa Fluor 488 antibody revealed extensive DNA damage of the A549 cells which indicated probable PARP inhibition (similar to Perophoramidine). Through molecular docking and molecular dynamic (MD) simulation studies the binding efficiency of our compounds with poly(ADP&#8208;ribose)polymerase 1 (PARP 1) enzyme was determined. Chemiluminescent PARP Assay with Histone&#8208;coated strips indicated that the most active compounds from the phenotypic screening induced PARP&#8208;1 inhibition with IC  50  s of 1.3 to&#160;1.5 microM.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;efficient Ultrathin PdCuMo Porous Nanosheets with Abundant Defects for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To reduce the over&#8208;dependence on Pt, Pd&#8208;based catalysts have become one of the most effective candidates for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In order to further accelerate the ORR kinetics and strengthen the catalytic performance of Pd catalyst, component optimization and morphology design are adopted to achieve these goals. Although great progress has been made, it is still difficult to obtain porous ultrathin nanosheets with excellent performance by a simple method. Here, ultrathin PdCuMo porous nanosheets (PdCuMo NSs) were successfully prepared. This structure possessed a large specific surface area with rich cavities and structural defects, significantly enhancing its ORR performance. In special, the mass activity of PdCuMo NSs was 1.46 A mg  &#8208;1  at 0.90 V, which&#160;was 12.2, &#160; 8.6, 2.7 times as high as that of Pd/C, Pt/C and PdCuMo nanoparticles (PdCuMo NPs), respectively. In addition, it had an excellent ability to resist CO poisoning and exhibited remarkable long&#8208;term stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Temperature Driven Transformation of the Flexible Metal&#8211;Organic Framework DUT&#8208;8(Ni)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;interpenetrated DUT&#8208;8(Ni)_cp MOF transforms upon heating into an interpenetrated ccp phase showing huge thermal effect, suggesting the bond breaking and reformation upon the phase transition. The ccp has the lowest energy among known solvent free DUT&#8208;8(Ni) structures. The ccp and cp phases have similar densities and dispersion energies, but differ in strain energies, pointing on the more relaxed single framework in the ccp phase.







Abstract
DUT&#8208;8(Ni) metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) belongs to the family of flexible pillared layer materials. The desolvated framework can be obtained in the open pore form (op) or in the closed pore form (cp), depending on the crystal size regime. In the present work, we report on the behaviour of desolvated DUT&#8208;8(Ni) at elevated temperatures. For both, op and cp variants, heating causes a structural transition, leading to a new, crystalline compound, containing two interpenetrated networks. The state of the framework before transition (op vs. cp) influences the transition temperature: the small particles of the op phase transform at significantly lower temperature in comparison to the macroparticles of the cp phase, transforming close to the decomposition temperature. The new compound, confined closed pore phase (ccp), was characterized by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and spectroscopic techniques, such as IR, EXAFS, and positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS). Thermal effects of structural transitions were studied using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), showing an overall exothermic effect of the process, involving bond breaking and reformation. Theoretical calculations reveal the energetics, driving the observed temperature induced phase transition.

Perfluoroalkoxylation reactions of heteroaromatic compounds, carbon&#8208;carbon multiple bonds, and substitutions at sp3 carbons with CF3O group can be accomplished by several strategies such as thermal radical methods, photocatalysis, electrolysis, electron transfer and redox neutral radical and nucleophilic processes







Abstract
Direct fluoroalkoxylation reactions of (hetero)arenes, carbon&#8208;carbon multiple bonds, and substitution reactions at Csp3 carbon centers by CF3O, CHF2O, and (CF3)2CFO groups are discussed. Emphasis on thermal radical, electron transfer, photocatalytic, electrochemical and redox&#8208;neutral radical methods are placed to accomplish fluoroalkoxylation reactions. All these methods employ either radical fluoroalkoxylating reagents or some nucleophilic trifluoromethoxylating sources of CF3O. A summary of all these methods is provided in Table&#8197;2.

         <title>Hydrocarbon Soluble Alkali&#8208;Metal&#8208;Aluminium Hydride Surrog[ATES]</title>

         <dc:description>
Saturated 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidide, TMP, has long played a key role in synthesis, here combined with an unsaturated dihydropyridine unit, 2&#8208;tBuC5H5N, both contribute to the stability of a series of alkali metal aluminate structures by engaging in non&#8208;covalent interactions with alkali metal cations, the extent of which depends on the alkali metal.







Abstract
A series of group&#8197;1 hydrocarbon&#8208;soluble donor free aluminates [AM(tBuDHP)(TMP)Al(iBu)2] (AM=Li, Na, K, Rb) have been synthesised by combining an alkali metal dihydropyridyl unit [(2&#8208;tBuC5H5N)AM)] containing a surrogate hydride (sp3 C&#8722;H) with [(iBu)2Al(TMP)]. These aluminates have been characterised by X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. While the lithium aluminate forms a monomer, the heavier alkali metal aluminates exist as polymeric chains propagated by non&#8208;covalent interactions between the alkali metal cations and the alkyldihydropyridyl units. Solvates [(THF)Li(tBuDHP)(TMP)Al(iBu)2] and [(TMEDA)Na(tBuDHP)(TMP)Al(iBu)2] have also been crystallographically characterised. Theoretical calculations show how the dispersion forces tend to increase on moving from Li to Rb, as opposed to the electrostatic forces of stabilization, which are orders of magnitude more significant. Having unique structural features, these bimetallic compounds can be considered as starting points for exploring unique reactivity trends as alkali&#8208;metal&#8208;aluminium hydride surrog[ATES].

         <title>Proton Conduction at High Temperature in High&#8208;Symmetry Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Molecular Crystals of RuIII Complexes with Six Imidazole&#8211;Imidazolate Ligands</title>

         <dc:description>
The crystals of [RuIII(HIm)3(Im)3](1) are one of the rapid proton&#8208;transport materials to work as proton conductors at high temperatures. The proton flow is caused by the strong rotations of Im&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;Im H&#8208;bonding imidazole groups from 200&#8197;K. In the upper left image, as the temperature increases to 400&#8197;K, six coordinated imidazole groups are strongly rotating to transport protons. In the lower right image, whole&#8208;molecule rotations start becoming the main rotation above 400&#8197;K. More information can be found in the Research Article by M.&#8197;Tadokoro et&#8197;al.

         <title>Access to Pyridinyl or Pyridinium Aza&#8208;BODIPYs with Tunable Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescence through ICT from 4&#8208;Pyridinyl Pyrroles
</title>

         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot protocol for the concise and rapid synthesis of 4&#8208;pyridinyl pyrroles involved in in&#8197;situ generated 2H&#8208;azirine was developed. 1/7&#8208;Pyridinyl and pyridinium NIR Aza&#8208;BODIPYs with/without rigidity were further constructed. These pyridinyl Aza&#8208;BOIDIPYs displayed slight bathochromic shifts and maintained bright NIR emission compared with phenyl analogues. Pyridinium Aza&#8208;BODIPYs showed ICT characteristic effect and may be located in lysosome in cells.







Abstract
Aza&#8208;dipyrromethene boron difluoride (Aza&#8208;BODIPY) dyes have attracted much interest in recent decades. In this manuscript, we provide a facile way to access pyridine&#8208;substituted pyrroles. A series of 1/7&#8208;pyridinyl and pyridinium near&#8208;infrared (NIR) Aza&#8208;BODIPYs with/without rigidity were constructed and their spectroscopic properties were extensively investigated. These pyridinyl Aza&#8208;BOIDIPYs displayed slight bathochromic shifts and maintained bright NIR emission. Pyridinium Aza&#8208;BODIPYs showed increased bathochromic shift, however, the molar extinction coefficients and fluorescence quantum yields were decreased owing to ICT effect. The impacts followed the order of pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;ium&gt;pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ium&gt;pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;ium, which was in consistence with their ICT strength. MO calculation was performed to provide possible explanation to the red&#8208;shifted absorption/emission, and apparent charge separation in pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;ium Aza&#8208;BODIPYs. The pyridinium Aza&#8208;BODIPY localized in lysosome and potentially avoided harmful &#8216;&#8216;alkalinizing effects&#8217;&#8217; of traditional lysosome&#8208;targeting fluorescent dyes containing amine moiety. We are working on construction of pyridinyl and pyridinium Aza&#8208;BODIPY photosensitizers against microbials or tumors.

         <title>Solvent Effects on Ultrafast Charge Transfer Population: Insights from the Quantum Dynamics of Guanine&#8208;Cytosine in Chloroform</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We study the ultrafast photoactivated dynamics of the hydrogen bonded dimer Guanine&#8208;Cytosine in chloroform solution, focusing on the population of the Guanine [[EQUATION]] Cytosine charge transfer state (GC&#8208;CT), an important elementary process for the photophysics and photochemistry of nucleic acids. We integrate a quantum dynamics propagation scheme, based on a linear vibronic model parameterized through time dependent density functional theory calculations, with four different solvation models, either implicit or explicit. On average,
after 50 fs, 30 [[EQUATION]] 40% of the bright excited state population
has been transferred to GC&#8208;CT. This process is thus fast and effective, especially when transferring from the Guanine bright excited states, in line with the available experimental studies. Independent of the adopted solvation model, the population of GC&#8208;CT is however disfavored in solution with respect to the gas phase. We show that dynamical solvation effects are responsible for this puzzling result and assess the different chemical&#8208;physical effects modulating the population of CT states on the ultrafast time&#8208;scale. We also propose some simple analyses to predict how solvent can affect the population transfer between bright and CT states, showing that effect of the solute/solvent electrostatic interactions on the energy of the CT state can provide a rather reliable indication of its possible population.</dc:description>

         <title>Proteophenes &#8208; amino acid functionalized thiophene&#8208;based fluorescent ligands for visualization of protein deposits in tissue sections with Alzheimer&#180;s disease pathology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein deposits composed of specific proteins or peptides are associated with several neurodegenerative diseases and fluorescent ligands able to detect these pathological hallmarks are vital. Here, we report the synthesis of a class of thiophene&#8208;based ligands, denoted proteophenes, with different amino acid side&#8208;chain functionalities along the conjugated backbone, which display selectivity towards specific disease&#8208;associated protein aggregates in tissue sections with Alzheimer&#180;s disease (AD) pathology. The selectivity of the ligands towards AD associated pathological hallmarks, such as aggregates of the amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptide or tau filamentous inclusions, was highly dependent on the chemical nature of the amino acid functionality, as well as on the location of the functionality along the pentameric thiophene backbone. Finally, the concept of synthesizing donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor proteophenes with distinct photophysical properties was shown.

Here, we report the synthesis of a class of thiophene-based ligands, denoted proteophenes, with different amino acid side-chain functionalities along the conjugated backbone, which display selectivity towards specific disease-associated protein aggregates in tissue sections with Alzheimer&#180;s disease (AD) pathology. The selectivity of the ligands towards AD associated pathological hallmarks, such as aggregates of the amyloid-&#946; (A&#946;) peptide or tau filamentous inclusions, was highly dependent on the chemical nature of the amino acid functionality, as well as on the location of the functionality along the pentameric thiophene backbone. Finally, the concept of synthesizing donor-acceptor-donor proteophenes with distinct photophysical properties was shown. Our findings provide the structural and functional basis for the development of new thiophene-based ligands that can be utilized for optical assignment of different aggregated proteinaceous species in tissue sections.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reaction of Pertechnetate in Highly Alkaline Solution: Synthesis and Characterization of the Nitridotrioxotechnetate Ba[TcO3N]</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The preparation of novel technetium oxides, their characterization and the general investigation of technetium chemistry are of significant importance, since fundamental research has so far mainly focused on the group homologues. Whereas the structure chemistry of technetium in strongly oxidizing media is dominated by the&#160;[TcO4]&#8208; anion, our recent investigation yielded the new [TcO3N]2&#8208; anion. Brown single crystals of Ba[TcO  3  N] were obtained under hydrothermal conditions starting from Ba(OH)  2  &#183;  8H  2  O and NH  4  [TcO  4  ] at 200 &#176;C. Ba[TcO3N] crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system with the space group  P  2  1  /  n  (  a  = 7.2159(4) &#197;,  b  = 7.8536(5) &#197;,  c  = 7.4931(4) &#197; and  &#946;  = 104.279(2)&#176;). The crystal structure of Ba[TcO3N] consists of isolated [TcO3N]2&#8208; tetrahedra, which are surrounded by Ba  2+  cations. XANES measurements complement the oxidation state +VII for technetium. Raman spectroscopic experiments on Ba[TcO  3  N] single crystals exhibit characteristic Tc&#8208;O and Tc&#8208;N vibrational modes.</dc:description>

         <title>Dioxygen Activation by Redox&#8208;Active Bis(aldimine) Ligand Bridged Diruthenium Complex Possessing Singlet Ground State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unexplored &#8216;actor&#8217; behavior of redox&#8208;active bis(aldimine) congener, p&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bis(picoline)aldimine   (L1),   towards dioxygen activation and subsequent functionalization of its backbone was demonstrated on coordination with {Ru(acac)  2  } (acac=   acetylacetonate). Reaction under aerobic condition led to   the one&#8208;pot generation of dinuclear complexes with unperturbed L1, imino&#8208;   carbox   amido (   L2    &#8208;    ) and bis(   carbox   amido)   (L3  2    &#8208;    )   bridged isovalent  {   Ru  II  (&#181;&#8208;   L   1   )Ru  II   },    1/    {   Ru  I    I     I    (&#181;&#8208;   L   3    2     &#8208;    )Ru  I    I     I    },    3    and   mixed&#8208;valent {   Ru  II  (&#181;&#8208;   L   2    &#8208;    )Ru  I    I     I    },  2  . Authentication of the complexes along with the redox non&#8208;innocence behavior of their bridge have been validated through structure, spectroelectrochemistry and DFT calculations.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectroscopy has been widely used to study (bio)molecules in solution. However, its solid&#8208;state applications have been restricted due to experimental limitations and artifacts. Having overcome some of them, we now present the first VCD study of nucleoside crystals. A two&#8208;orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude enhancement of VCD signal was observed due to high molecular order in the crystals, and resulting supramolecular chirality. This allowed us to obtain high&#8208;quality VCD spectra within minutes using minute amounts of samples. We show that VCD technique is extremely sensitive in detecting changes in a crystal order, and able to distinguish different hydration states of crystals. This elevates it to a new level, as a fast and efficient tool to study chiral crystalline samples. We demonstrate that VCD is capable of near&#8208;instantaneous detection of hydration polymorphs and crystal degradation, which is of substantial interest in pharmaceutical industry (quality and stability control).</dc:description>

         <title>Prussian Blue Type Cocatalysts for Enhancing the Photocatalytic Water Oxidation Performance of BiVO4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Six MII&#8208;CoIII Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) (M=Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn) cocatalysts are synthesized and deposited on the surface of BiVO4 for boosting the surface catalytic efficiency and enhancing photogenerated carries separation efficiency of BiVO4.







Abstract
The efficiency of photocatalytic overall water splitting reactions is usually limited by the high energy barrier and complex multiple electron&#8208;transfer processes of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Although bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) as the photocatalyst has been developed for enhancing the kinetics of the water oxidation reaction, it still suffers from challenges of fast recombination of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs and poor photocatalytic activity. Herein, six MII&#8208;CoIII Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) (M=Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn) cocatalysts are synthesized and deposited on the surface of BiVO4 for boosting the surface catalytic efficiency and enhancing photogenerated carries separation efficiency of BiVO4. Six MII&#8208;CoIII PBAs@BiVO4 photocatalysts all demonstrate increased photocatalytic water oxidation performance compared to that of BiVO4 alone. Among them, the Co&#8722;Co PBA@BiVO4 photocatalyst is employed as a representative research object and is thoroughly characterized by electrochemistry, electronic microscope as well as multiple spectroscopic analyses. Notably, BiVO4 coupling with Co&#8722;Co PBA cocatalyst could capture more photons than that of pure BiVO4, facilitating the transfer of photogenerated charge carriers between BiVO4 and Co&#8722;Co PBA as well as the surface catalytic efficiency of BiVO4. Overall, this work would promote the synthesis strategy development for exploring new types of composite photocatalysts for water oxidation.

         <title>Pseudo&#8208;Octahedral Iron(II) Complexes with Near&#8208;Degenerate Charge Transfer and Ligand Field States at the Franck&#8208;Condon Geometry</title>

Iron(II) complexes with 6,2&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;carboxypyridyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;methylamine&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;pyridine ligands possess low&#8208;energy 1MLCT states. 3MLCT and 3/5MC excited states are nearly degenerate at the Franck&#8208;Condon geometry. Expansion of the coordination sphere lowers the 3/5MC energies shortening the 3MLCT lifetime. Cooling and solvent reorganization occurs within 33&#8197;ps to give the relaxed 5MC state with ca. 0.5&#8197;ns lifetime.







Abstract
Increasing the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT) excited state lifetime of polypyridine iron(II) complexes can be achieved by lowering the ligand's &#960;* orbital energy and by increasing the ligand field splitting. In the homo&#8208; and heteroleptic complexes [Fe(cpmp)2]2+ (12+) and [Fe(cpmp)(ddpd)]2+ (22+) with the tridentate ligands 6,2&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;carboxypyridyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;methylamine&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;pyridine (cpmp) and N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;N,N&#8217;&#8208;di&#8208;pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ylpyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diamine (ddpd) two or one dipyridyl ketone moieties provide low energy &#960;* acceptor orbitals. A good metal&#8208;ligand orbital overlap to increase the ligand field splitting is achieved by optimizing the octahedricity through CO and NMe units between the coordinating pyridines which enable the formation of six&#8208;membered chelate rings. The push&#8208;pull ligand cpmp provides intra&#8208;ligand and ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (ILCT, LL'CT) excited states in addition to MLCT excited states. Ground and excited state properties of 12+ and 22+ were accessed by X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses, resonance Raman spectroscopy, (spectro)electrochemistry, EPR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy, static and time&#8208;resolved IR and UV/Vis/NIR absorption spectroscopy as well as quantum chemical calculations.

         <title>Isolation of Elusive Phosphinidene&#8208;Chlorotetrylenes: The Heavier Cyanogen Chloride Analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elusive hetero&#8208;bileptic carbenes&#8208;stabilized singlet phosphinidiene&#8208;chlorosilylene, and chlorogermylenes with majorly contributing covalent electron&#8208;sharing &#963; bonds are isolated and structurally characterized in the solid state.







Abstract
The elusive phosphinidene&#8208;chlorotetrylenes, [PGeCl] and [PSiCl] have been stabilized by the hetero&#8208;bileptic cyclic alkyl(amino) carbene (cAAC), N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands, and isolated in the solid state at room temperature as the first neutral monomeric species of this class with the general formulae (L)P&#8208;ECl(L&#8242;) (E=Ge, 3&#8201;a&#8211;3&#8201;c; E=Si, 6; L=cAAC; L&#8242;=NHC). Compounds 3&#8201;a&#8211;3&#8201;c have been synthesized by the reaction of cAAC&#8208;supported potassium phosphinidenides [cAAC=PK(THF)x]n (1&#8201;a&#8211;1&#8201;c) with the adduct NHC:&#8594;GeCl2 (2). Similarly, compound 6 has been synthesized via reaction of 1&#8201;a with NHC:&#8594;SiCl2 adduct (4). Compounds 3&#8201;a&#8211;3&#8201;c, and 6 have been structurally characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometric analysis. DFT calculations revealed that the heteroatom P in 3 bears two lone pairs; the non&#8208;bonding pair with 67.8&#8201;% of s&#8208; and 32&#8201;% of p character, whereas the other lone pair is involved in &#960; backdonation to the CcAAC&#8208;N &#960;* of cAAC. The Ge atom in 3 contains a lone pair with 80&#8201;% of s character, and slightly involved in the &#960; backdonation to CNHC. EDA&#8208;NOCV analyses showed that two charged doublet fragments {(cAAC)(NHC)}+, and {PGeCl}&#8722; prefer to form one covalent electron&#8208;sharing &#963; bond, one dative &#963; bond, one dative &#960; bond, and a charge polarized weak &#960; bond. The covalent electron&#8208;sharing &#963; bond contributes to the major stabilization energy to the total orbital interaction energy of 3, enabling the first successful isolations of this class of compounds (3, 6) in the laboratory.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of High&#8208;Strained Metal Vinylidene and Metal Carbyne</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cyclic metal vinylidene with high ring&#8208;strain was obtained via a one&#8208;pot synthesis. The reactivity of this metal vinylidene with nucleophiles and electrophiles was investigated, resulting in unprecedented conversion of the metal vinylidene to a metal carbyne in five&#8208;membered ring.







Abstract
A novel one&#8208;pot reaction producing a metal vinylidene structure in a five&#8208;membered ring by cyclization of a multiyne has been achieved. The ring strain and the high stability of the cyclic metal vinylidene complexes have been analyzed experimentally and computationally. The metal vinylidene unit in a fused&#8208;ring complex is unreactive to both nucleophiles and electrophiles. It reacts however at the nearby carbonyl group achieving the unprecedented conversion of metal tributing factors for the aromaticity&#8208;driven process has been studied by DFT calculations.

         <title>Development of an Enantioselective Allylic Alkylation of Acyclic &#945;&#8208;Fluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketoesters for Asymmetric Synthesis of 3&#8208;Fluoropiperidines</title>

         <dc:description>
Get into Gear: The Trost ligand series promotes the enantioselective allylation of &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketoesters to generate 3&#8208;fluoropiperidines in up to 92&#8201;%&#8197;ee. We have employed the Lloyd&#8208;Jones Norrby model to explain the origins of enantiocontrol and propose that the catalyst backbone engenders a gearing effect whereby the ester adopts an s&#8208;trans conformation that enforces the alkene moiety of the enoate to adopt an s&#8208;cis orientation, thereby controlling facial to the &#960;&#8208;allyl complex.







Abstract
The first useful enantioselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation of &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketoesters has been achieved using the Trost family of chiral ligands yielding products in up to 92&#8201;%&#8197;ee. This work provides new insights regarding the typically modest selectivities associated with acyclic &#945;&#8208;fluoroenolates and shows experimental evidence that the typically poor levels of enantiocontrol associated with these systems are not necessarily due to the presence of E/Z enolate mixtures. Finally, this methodology allows the easy preparation of useful 3&#8208;fluoropiperidine intermediates, and it is demonstrated that these systems are applicable to a range of functionalization reactions leading to new building blocks for the discovery of bioactive products.

This work provides new insights regarding the typically modest selectivities associated with acyclic &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-fluoroenolates and shows experimental evidence that the typically poor levels of enantiocontrol associated with these systems are not necessarily due to the presence of &lt;i&gt;E/Z&lt;/i&gt; enolate mixtures. Finally, this methodology allows the easy preparation of useful 3-fluoropiperidine intermediates, and it is demonstrated that these systems are applicable to a range of functionalization reactions leading to new building blocks for the discovery of bioactive products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biohybrid Organic Heterostructure Based on Chlorophyll&#8208;Bacteriochlorophyll Aggregates for Ecofriendly Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the present work, BChl&#8722;Chl&#8208;based organic heterojunction structures were introduced for visible light&#8208;driven photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production. At the same time, a novel BChl&#8722;Chl&#8208;based organic heterojunction noble metal&#8208;free BChl@Chl@Ti3C2Tx photocatalyst was successfully constructed by a simple alternating deposition process of Chl and BChl on Ti3C2Tx nanosheets.







Abstract
Hydrogen energy is an abundant, clean, sustainable and environmentally friendly renewable energy source. Therefore, the production of hydrogen by photocatalytically splitting water on semiconductors has been considered in recent years as a promising and sustainable strategy for converting solar energy into chemical energy to replace conventional energy sources and to solve the growing problem of environmental pollution and the global energy crisis. However, highly efficient solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen production remains a huge challenge due to the poor visible light response of available photocatalytic materials and the low efficiency of separation and transfer of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs. In the present work, organic heterojunction structures based on bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) and chlorophyll (Chl) molecules were introduced and used for solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen production from water under visible light. Also, noble metal&#8208;free photocatalyst was successfully constructed on Ti3C2Tx nanosheets by simple successive deposition of Chl and BChl, which was used for the photocatalytic splitting water to hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The results show that the optimal BChl@Chl@Ti3C2Tx composite has a high HER performance with 114&#8197;&#956;mol/h/gcat, which is much higher than the BChl@Ti3C2Tx and Chl@Ti3C2Tx composites.

         <title>Current State of [Fe]&#8208;Hydrogenase and Its Biomimetic Models</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase can heterolytically cleave H2 and transfer the resulting hydride to an unsaturated substrate. Fruitful results have been achieved from studies on enzyme function, structure, catalytic mechanism, cofactor biosynthesis, biomimetic model development and artificial enzyme construction. But application scenarios of this enzyme are still in absence.







Abstract
[Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase, the third type of natural hydrogenase, is capable to heterolytically activate hydrogen molecule and transfer the resulting hydride to an unsaturated substrate, making it a promising hydrogenation catalyst. Over the last three decades, fruitful results on this enzyme have been achieved. In this review, we have summarized the major progresses about this enzyme including its structural characterisation, catalytic mechanism, cofactor biosynthesis, mimetic model development as well as artificial enzymes construction. In the meanwhile, challenges and opportunities of this enzyme and its mimetic systems in the application of synthetic chemistry and others are discussed.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;up Synthesis of Water&#8208;Soluble Gold Nanoparticles Stabilized by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes: From Structural Characterization to Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small water&#8208;soluble N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;stabilized gold nanoparticles (NHC@AuNPs) were synthesized via the bottom&#8208;up approach and showed suitability for applications in catalysis and biomedicine.







Abstract
N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have become attractive ligands for functionalizing gold nanoparticle surfaces with applications ranging from catalysis to biomedicine. Despite their great potential, NHC stabilized gold colloids (NHC@AuNPs) are still scarcely explored and further efforts should be conducted to improve their design and functionalization. Here, the &#8216;bottom&#8208;up&#8217; synthesis of two water&#8208;soluble gold nanoparticles (AuNP&#8208;1 and AuNP&#8208;2) stabilized by hydrophilic mono&#8208; and bidentate NHC ligands is reported together with their characterization by various spectroscopic and analytical methods. The NPs showed key differences likely to be due to the selected NHC ligand systems. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed small quasi&#8208;spherical and faceted NHC@AuNPs of similar particle size (ca. 2.3&#8211;2.6&#8197;nm) and narrow particle size distribution, but the colloids featured different ratios of Au(I)/Au(0) by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Furthermore, the NHC@AuNPs were supported on titania and fully characterized. The new NPs were studied for their catalytic activity towards the reduction of nitrophenol substrates, the reduction of resazurin and for their photothermal efficiency. Initial results on their application in photothermal therapy (PTT) were obtained in human cancer cells in&#8197;vitro. The aforementioned reactions represent important model reactions towards wastewater remediation, bioorthogonal transformations and cancer treatment.

In this concept, the recently representative progress of non&#8208;fused ring electron acceptors (NFRAs) for organic solar cells is highlighted by focusing on introducing the newly developed molecular design strategies and discussing the structure&#8208;performance relationships. A perspective on the future design of high&#8208;performance NFRAs is also discussed.







Abstract
Non&#8208;fullerene acceptors with fused&#8208;ring structures have rapidly improved the performance of organic solar cells over the past five years, but they still suffer from synthetic complexity and thus high material costs, one of the major obstacles of hindering their commercialization process. The construction of non&#8208;fused ring acceptors (NFRAs) has recently been regarded as a feasible solution due to their facile synthesis and satisfactory device performances. Thus in this concept, we highlight the important progress of NFRAs in recent years, and discuss the key relationship between molecular design strategies and device performance. Finally, we provide some potential molecular insights for the future design of high&#8208;performance NFRAs.

         <title>Differentiable Formation of Chiroptical Lanthanide Heterometallic LnnLn&#8217;4&#8208;n(L6) (n=0&#8211;4) Tetrahedra with C2&#8208;Symmetrical Bis(tridentate) Ligands</title>

         <dc:description>
Heterometallic supramolecular tetrahedra can be prepared by self&#8208;assembly of lanthanide ions with ligand L followed by crystallization. Upon ether diffusion with a mixture of [Eu2L3] and [Gd2L3] helicates, a mixture of heterometallic EunGd&#8217;4&#8208;n(L6) (n=0&#8211;4) tetrahedra was prepared. Ligand L demonstrated preferential formation of heterometallic tetrahedron which is confirmed by MS deconvolution.







Abstract
Construction of lanthanide heterometallic complex is important for engineering multifunction molecular containers. However, it remains a challenge because of the similar ionic radii of lanthanides. Herein we attempt to prepare chiral lanthanide heterometallic tetrahedra. Upon crystallization with a mixture of [Eu2L3] and [Ln2L3] (Ln=Gd, Tb and Dy) helicates, a mixture of heterometallic EunLn&#8217;4&#8208;n(L6) (n=0&#8211;4) tetrahedra was prepared. Selective formation of heterometallic tetrahedron was observed as MS deconvolution results deviated from statistical results. The formation of heterometallic tetrahedron was found to be sensitive to ionic radii as well as the ratio of the two helicates used in the crystallization.

         <dc:description>During the past two decades, single&#8208;atom&#8208;centered medium&#8208;sized germanium clusters [M@Ge  n  ] (M = transition metals, n&gt;12) have been extensively explored, both from theoretical perspectives and experimental gas&#8208;phase syntheses. However, the actual structural arrangements of the Ge  13  and Ge  14  endohedral cages are still ambiguous and has long remained an unresolved problem for experimental implementation. In this work, we successfully synthesize 13&#8208;/14&#8208;vertex Ge clusters [Nb@Ge  13  ]  3&#8722;  (  1  ) and [Nb@Ge  14  ]  3&#8722;  (  2  ), which are structurally characterized and exhibit unprecedented topologies, neither classical deltahedra nor 3&#8208;connected polyhedral structures. Theoretical analysis indicates that the major stabilization of the Ge backbones arises due to the substantial interaction of Ge 4  p  &#8208;AOs with the endohedral Nb 4  d  &#8208;AOs through three/four&#8208;center two&#8208;electron bonds with an enhanced electron density accumulated over the shortest Nb&#8208;Ge13 contact in  1  . Low occupancies of the direct two&#8208;center two&#8208;electron (2c&#8208;2e) Nb&#8208;Ge and Ge&#8208;Ge &#963; bonds point to a considerable degree of electron delocalization over the Ge cages revealing their electron deficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>(Na0.74Ag1.26)BaSnS4: A New AgGaS2&#8208;Type Nonlinear Optical Sulfide with a Wide Band Gap and High Laser Induced Damage Threshold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of high&#8208;power solid&#8208;state lasers is in urgent need of infrared (IR) nonlinear optical (NLO) materials with wide band gaps and high laser&#8208;induced damage thresholds (LIDTs). Herein, a new compressed chalcopyrite&#8208;like IR NLO crystal (Na  0.74  Ag  1.26  )BaSnS  4  was successfully synthesized using a facile high&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state method. Its structure can be considered as a variant of chalcopyrite AgGaS  2  (AGS)&#8208;type ones. It features a three&#8208;dimensional (3  D  ) framework constructed by corner&#8208;sharing {[(Na/Ag)S  4  ]  7  &#8211;  }  &#8734;  layers and isolated SnS  4  tetrahedra with negative cavities occupied by counter ion Ba  2+  . (Na  0.74  Ag  1.26  )BaSnS  4  exhibits phase&#8208;matchable moderate SHG response (0.31 &#215; AGS), wide band gap (3.70 eV), and high LIDT (6.44 &#215; AGS). The theoretical calculations reveal that the NLO response of (Na  0.74  Ag  1.26  )BaSnS  4  is mainly originated from the synergetic effects of AgS  4  and SnS  4  tetrahedra, and the inclusion of alkaline and alkaline earth metals are responsible for the wide band gap and high LIDT. Moreover, the discovery of chalcopyrite&#8208;like compound will provide a feasible design strategy for the exploration of new promising IR NLO materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Discriminating Chiral Supramolecular Motions by Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular motions are closely associated with the behaviors and properties of organic materials. However, monitoring molecular motions is challenging. Herein, a chiral supramolecular system consisting of L&#8208;/D&#8208;phenylalanine (LPF/DPF) as a chiral inducer and an achiral tetraphenylethene derivative (TPEF) as a molecular rotor has been proposed and explored for real&#8208;time discriminating the supramolecular motions by the visualization of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signal variations. Derived from the ordered molecular motions of TPEF induced by LPF/DPF, highly organized aggregates have been progressively assembled in a controlled manner with differentiated morphologies, including spherical particles, one&#8208;dimensional fibers, and floor&#8208;shaped supercrystals. Notably, increasing level of ordered aggregates, in turn, led to quenching emissions, while the CPL signals have been dramatically amplified accompanying by a sharp enhancement of luminescence dissymmetry factors (glum) from nearly 0 to &#8208;0.1. The significant amplification of CPL is attributed to the ordered aggregates of supramolecules, leading to the decrease of electric transition dipole moments in supramolecular system. As a result of the chiral supramolecular motions powered by supramolecular crystallization, the supramolecular motions are conveniently discriminated by visual CPL signal variation with an enhancement of glum value from 0 to &#8208;0.1 in real time.</dc:description>

         <title>Cationic Gold(II) Complexes: Experimental and Theoretical Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold(II) complexes are rare and their application for catalysis of chemical transformations is underexplored. The reason is their easy oxidation or reduction to the more stable gold(III) or gold(I) complexes, respectively. We explored the thermodynamics of the formation of the [(L)Au  II  X]  +  complexes (L = ligand, X = halogen) from their gold(III) precursors and investigated the stability and the spectral properties in the IR and VIS range of the formed gold(II) complexes in the gas phase. The results show that the best ancillary ligands L for stabilizing gaseous [(L)Au  II  X]  +  complexes are bidentate and tridentate ligands with nitrogen donor atoms. The electronic structure and spectral properties of the investigated gold(II) complexes were correlated with the quantum chemical calculations. The results show that the molecular and electronic structure of the gold(II) complexes as well as their spectroscopic properties are very similar to the analogous stable copper(II) complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Vicinal Diol Approach for the Total Synthesis of Molestin E, ent&#8208;Sinulacembranolide A and ent&#8208;Sinumaximol A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work an approach for the synthesis of furanocembranoid natural products containing the C&#8208;7,8&#8208;diol moiety is disclosed. This culminated in the first total synthesis of the natural product molestin E, together with  ent  &#8208;sinulacembranolide A and  ent  &#8208;sinumaximol A as well as a thorough exploration of their chemistry. Late&#8208;stage ring&#8208;closure of the C&#8208;7,8&#8208;diols to the corresponding epoxides was also demonstrated. Key features of this synthetic strategy include a stereoselective Baylis&#8208;Hillman reaction, ring&#8208;closing metathesis and Shiina macrolactonisation.  Chiral&#8208;pool materials were deployed to ensure the desired absolute stereochemistry which was confirmed by late&#8208;stage single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.</dc:description>

         <title>YfeX &#8211; A New Platform for Carbene Transferase Development with High Intrinsic Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbene transfer biocatalysis has evolved from basic science to an area with vast potential for the development of new industrial processes. In this study, we show that YfeX, naturally a peroxidase, has great potential for the development of new carbene transferases, due to its high intrinsic reactivity, especially for the N&#8208;H insertion reaction of aromatic and aliphatic primary and secondary amines. YfeX shows high stability against organic solvents (methanol and DMSO), greatly improving turnover of hydrophobic substrates. Interestingly, in styrene cyclopropanation, WT YfeX naturally shows high enantioselectivity, generating the trans product with 87% selectivity for the (R,R) enantiomer. WT YfeX also catalyzes the Si&#8212;H insertion efficiently. Steric effects in the active site were further explored using the R232A variant. Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM) calculations reveal details on the mechanism of Si&#8212;H insertion. YfeX, and potentially other peroxidases, are exciting new targets for the development of improved carbene transferases.</dc:description>

         <title>Microscopic Reactivity of Phenylferrate Ions toward Organyl Halides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite its practical importance, organoiron chemistry remains poorly understood due to its mechanistic complexity. Here, we focus on the oxidative addition of organyl halides to phenylferrate anions in the gas phase. By mass&#8208;selecting individual phenylferrate anions, we can determine the effect of the oxidation state, the ligation, and the nuclearity of the iron complex on its reactions with a series of organyl halides RX. We find that Ph  2  Fe(I)  &#8722;  and other low&#8208;valent ferrates are more reactive than Ph  3  Fe(II)  &#8722;  ; Ph  4  Fe(III)  &#8722;  is inert. The coordination of a PPh  3  ligand or the presence of a second iron center lower the reactivity. Besides direct cross&#8208;coupling reactions resulting in the formation of RPh, we also observe the abstraction of halogen atoms. This reaction channel shows the readiness of organoiron species to undergo radical&#8208;type processes. Complementary DFT calculations afford further insight and rationalize the high reactivity of the Ph  2  Fe(I)  &#8722;  complex by the exothermicity of the oxidative addition and the low barriers associated with this reaction step. At the same time, they point to the importance of changes of the spin state in the reactions of Ph  3  Fe(II)  &#8722;  .</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, development and detailed investigation of a SN&#8242;&#8208;type intramolecular aromatic substitution reaction involving &#945;&#8208;arylazaoxyallyl cation intermediate, is disclosed. The study showcased that while &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;chlorohydroxamate could be activated by a combination of base and 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP) into the corresponding azaoxyallyl cations, it could further emerge into a &#960;&#8208;extended species involving the adjacent &#945;&#8208;aryl moiety, and this transition is contingent on electronic effects of the aromatic ring as well as on &#945;&#8208;substituents. An effective activation of the &#945;&#8208;aromatic ring could pave the path for intramolecular Ar(Csp2)&#8208;N bond formation towards oxindoles. Control experiments and DFT calculations suggested that a non&#8208;pericyclic nucleophilic amination pathway is most likely operative and precluded the possibility of concerted or electrophilic amination mechanism. HFIP as the reaction solvent plays pivotal roles in the transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Meso&#8208;Carbon Atom Nucleophilic Attack Susceptibility in the Sterically Strained Antiaromatic Bis&#8208;BODIPY Macrocycle and Extended Electron&#8208;Deficient BODIPY Precursor
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sterically strained and non&#8208;fluorescent antiaromatic macrocycle which has two BODIPY subunits linked by p&#8208;divinylphenyl bridges has been prepared and characterized by a variety of spectroscopic and theoretical methods. It has an unusual susceptibility to the nucleophilic attack at the meso&#8208;carbon atom.







Abstract
A sterically strained 32&#960;&#8208;electron antiaromatic bis&#8208;BODIPY macrocycle in which two BODIPY fragments are linked by p&#8208;divinylbenzene groups was prepared and characterized. Unlike regular BODIPYs, the fluorescence in this macrocycle is quenched. The broad signals in the NMR spectra of the macrocycle were explained by the vibronic freedom of the p&#8208;divinylbenzene fragments. The possible diradicaloid nature of the macrocycle was excluded on the basis of variable&#8208;temperature EPR spectra in solution and in solid state, which is indicative of its closed&#8208;shell quinoidal structure. The meso&#8208;C&#8722;H bond in the macrocycle and its precursor BODIPY dialdehyde 3 forms a weak hydrogen bond with THF and is susceptible for the nucleophilic attack by organic amines and cyanide anion. The reaction products of such a nucleophilic attack have meso&#8208;sp3 carbon atoms and were characterized by NMR, mass spectrometry and, in one case, X&#8208;ray crystallography. Unlike the initial bis&#8208;BODIPY macrocycle, the adducts have strong fluorescence in the 400&#8197;nm region. The electronic structure and spectroscopic properties of new chromophores were probed by density functional theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations and correlate well with the experimental data.

         <title>Elucidating the nature of the external acid sites of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites using NMR probe molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The identification of acid and nonacid species at the external surface of zeolites remains a major challenge, in contrast with the much&#8208;studied internal acid sites. Here, we show that the synthesis of zeolite ZSM&#8208;5 samples with distinct particle sizes, combined with solid&#8208;state NMR and computational studies of trimethylphosphine oxide (TMPO) adsorption, provides insight into the chemical species on the external surface of the zeolite crystals.&#160;  1  H&#8208;  31  P HETCOR NMR spectra of TMPO&#8208;loaded zeolites exhibit a broad correlation peak at &#948;  P  &#160;~ 35 &#8208; 55 ppm and &#948;  H  &#160;~ 5 &#8208; 12 ppm assigned to external SiOH species. Pore&#8208;mouth Br&#248;nsted acid sites exhibit&#160;  31  P and&#160;  1  H NMR resonances and adsorption energies close to those reported for internal acid sites interacting with TMPO. The presence of an external tricoordinate Al&#8208;Lewis site interacting strongly with TMPO is suggested, resulting in&#160;  31  P resonances that overlap with the peaks usually ascribed to the interaction of TMPO with Br&#248;nsted sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Arylfluorination of Alkenes: a Highlight on a Powerful New Method for the Access of Organofluorine Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorine incorporation into organic molecules is often beneficial to absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties or bioactivity. As a consequence, organofluorine compounds have become quite common amongst drugs and agrochemicals, and their preparation is a highly important topic in both synthetic organic chemistry and pharmaceutical chemistry. One of the newly developed methods for the access of organofluorine compounds is Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylfluorination. It is an olefin difunctionalization process, which simultaneously introduces an aryl group and a fluorine atom into an alkene framework. This highlight provides a concise overview of this powerful and versatile method.</dc:description>

         <title>Free Aluminylenes: An Emerging Class of Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aluminylenes (R&#8211;Al) are aluminium analogs of carbenes. In contrast to isolable carbenes, aluminylenes are extremely rare species. In the past years, pioneered by Schn&#246;ckel, Roesky and Power, a few free aluminylenes and their complexes have been reported. Such compounds have the aluminium atom in the oxidation state +I, which contrasts with classical organoaluminium derivatives that contain the element in the +III oxidation state. Aluminylenes, either in their free state or in the coordination sphere of a Lewis base, are capable of coordinating to transition metals and activating inert chemical bonds. Free aluminylenes are emerging as potent synthetic platforms for unusual aluminium species.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantiospecific syntheses of congested atropisomers through chiral (bis)aryne synthetic equivalents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthetic equivalents of the enantiopure binaphthyl bis(aryne) atropisomers derived from BINOL featuring a stereogenic axis vicinal to the two reactive triple bonds can be generated for the first time in solution in an enantiospecific manner. Using a two&#8208;step sequence based on the bidirectional [4 + 2] cycloaddition of furan derivatives followed by an aromatizative deoxygenation reaction, several 9,9&#8217;&#8208;bianthracenyl&#8208;based atropisomers could be prepared enantiospecifically in high enantiomeric purity. Alternatively, bidirectional reactions with anthracene, 2&#8208;bromostyrene, and perylene as the arynophiles afforded very congested bis(benzotriptycene), bis(tetraphene) and bis(anthra[1,2,3,4&#8208;  ghi  ]perylene) nanocarbon atropisomers in equally high enantiomeric purity. In complement, cross reactions with two different arynophiles revealed possible. The unusual atropisomer prototypes described in this study open the way to enantiopure polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon atropisomers designed for functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Fusion of Aza&#8208; and Oxadiborepins with Furans via a Reversible Ring Opening Process Furnishes Versatile Building Blocks for Extended &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A modular synthesis of both difurooxa&#8208; and difuroazadiborepins via a common precursor is demonstrated. Starting from 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bifuran, after protection of the positions 5 and 5&#8217; with bulky silyl groups, the formation of the novel polycycles proceeds through opening of the furan rings to a dialkyne and subsequent re&#8208;cyclization in the borylation step. The resulting difuran&#8208;fused diborepins show pronounced stability, highly planar tricyclic structures, and intense blue light emission. Deprotection and transformation into dibrominated building blocks that can be incorporated in &#960;&#8208;extended materials can be performed in one step. Detailed DFT calculations provide information about the aromaticity of the constituent rings of this polycycle.</dc:description>

Detailed DFT calculations provide information about the aromaticity of the constituent rings of this polycycle.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bioinspired Photocatalytic NADH Regeneration by Covalently Metalated Carbon Nitride for Enhanced CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial photosystem was constructed through the covalent attachment of Rh complex onto PCN. The integrated photocatalyst could regenerate NADH efficiently by integrating the light harvesting unit and the electron transfer unit through conjugated connection. By further coupling with FDH immobilized on the hydrophobic membrane, an enhanced HCOOH production could be obtained.







Abstract
Natural photosynthesis is a highly unified biocatalytic system, which coupled cofactor (NAD(P)H) regeneration and enzymatic CO2 reduction efficiently for solar energy conversion. Mimicking nature, a novel system with Rh complex covalently grafted onto NH2&#8208;functionalized polymeric carbon nitride (NH2&#8208;PCN) was constructed. The integrated connection of the light&#8208;harvesting and electron mediation modules as Rhm3&#8208;N&#8208;PCN could promote the efficient NAD+ reduction to NADH. As a result, the integrated system exhibited a conversion of &#8764;66&#8201;% within 20&#8197;minutes. By further coupling in&#8197;situ generated NADH with formate dehydrogenase (FDH), a photoenzymatic production of formic acid (HCOOH) from CO2 was accomplished. Moreover, by immobilizing FDH onto a hydrophobic membrane, an enhanced HCOOH production of &#8764;5.0&#8197;mM can be obtained due to the concentrated CO2 on the gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid three&#8208;phase interface. Our work herein provides an integrated strategy for coupling the anchored electron mediator with immobilized enzyme for enhanced artificial photosynthesis.

         <title>Understanding the Anion&#8208;Templated, OSDA&#8208;Free, Interzeolite Conversion Synthesis of High Silica Zeolite ZK&#8208;5
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High silica forms of the zeolite ZK&#8208;5 are prepared by an interzeolite conversion using inorganic cations and anions as templates. K+ and Cs+ cations and NO3&#8722; anions self&#8208;assemble within its lta and pau cages with a high degree of space filling and exchange with NH4+ followed by heating gives a microporous solid. This approach offers an alternative and organic structure directing agent&#8208;free route to directing zeolite synthesis.







Abstract
High silica zeolite ZK&#8208;5 (framework Si/Al=4.8) has been prepared by interzeolite conversion from ultrastable zeolite Y via a co&#8208;templating route using alkali metal cations and nitrate anions but without organic structure directing agents. The mechanism, which involves zeolite framework &#8211; alkali metal cation &#8211; nitrate anion ordering, has been established by a combination of chemical and thermal analyses, Raman spectroscopy, computational modelling, and X&#8208;ray powder diffraction. Ammonium exchange gives ZK&#8208;5 with occluded ammonium nitrate and subsequent heating gives microporous zeolite ZK&#8208;5.

         <title>Achieving Solution&#8208;Processed Non&#8208;Doped Single&#8208;Emitting&#8208;Layer White Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes through Adjusting Pyrene&#8208;Based Polyaromatic Hydrocarbon</title>

         <dc:description>
Two new pyrene&#8208;based polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) molecules&#8208;PyS and PyD were synthesized. Due to the more twisted and extended backbone, the bis&#8208;fused molecule PyD packed in neat Cmca space group in single&#8208;crystal system compared with P21/n for PyS, which may be favorable to form excimers in the solid state and showed solution&#8208;processed non&#8208;doped single&#8208;white&#8208;emitting&#8208;molecule SEL&#8208;WOLED with high performance.







Abstract
Single&#8208;emitting&#8208;layer white organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (SEL&#8208;WOLEDs) have developed rapidly in recent years due to the outstanding advantages of high efficiency, simple device structure, low cost, less phase separation, and stable emission color. Nevertheless, the relatively complicated host&#8208;dopant system is usually essential for most previous SEL&#8208;WOLEDs and the development of simple non&#8208;doped SEL&#8208;WOLEDs lags behind. Hence the straightforward synthesis of single&#8208;white&#8208;emitting molecules for non&#8208;doped SEL&#8208;WOLEDs still remains a great challengeable task. In this article, we designed and synthesized two new pyrene&#8208;based polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and used them as emitting layer materials in the OLED devices. When the molecules change from the mono&#8208;fused one to bis&#8208;fused one, the emitting light changes from greenish to white color. Further study indicated that the bis&#8208;fused molecule PyD with more twisted and extended backbone packed in neat Cmca space group in single&#8208;crystal system compared with P21/n for PyS, which may be favorable to form excimers in the solid state and broaden the emission spectrum in the OLEDs. As a result, a solution&#8208;processed non&#8208;doped single&#8208;white&#8208;emitting&#8208;molecule SEL&#8208;WOLED with high performance (e.&#8201;g., a high color rendering index of 66) is reported. The findings will be beneficial not only to further development of simple WOLEDs, but also to other related organic optoelectronic technology.

No need to pay for extras: Vinyl triflimides are a new compound class with unknown reactivity. Computational analysis identified homolytic cleavage of the N&#8722;Tf bond induced by triplet&#8211;triplet energy transfer (EnT) as an accessible reaction manifold. This hypothesis was verified, and vinyl triflimides were transformed into a range of &#945;&#8208;quaternary, &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethylated amines in a 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization reaction with no need for external CF3 reagents.







Abstract
Vinyl triflimides are a new compound class with unknown reactivity. A computational analysis identified homolytic cleavage of the N&#8722;Tf bond induced by triplet&#8211;triplet energy transfer (EnT) as a highly interesting reaction type that might be accessible. A combination of experimental and mechanistic work verified this hypothesis and proved the generated radicals to be amenable to radical&#8211;radical coupling. Thereby, vinyl triflimides were transformed into a range of &#945;&#8208;quaternary, &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethylated amines in a 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization reaction with no need for external CF3 reagents.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vinyl triflimides are a new compound class with unknown reactivity. A computational analysis identified homolytic cleavage of the N&#8722;Tf bond induced by triplet&#8211;triplet energy transfer (EnT) as a highly interesting reaction type that might be accessible. A combination of experimental and mechanistic work verified this hypothesis and proved the generated radicals to be amenable to radical&#8211;radical coupling. Thereby, vinyl triflimides were transformed into a range of &#945;-quaternary, &#946;-trifluoromethylated amines in a 1,2-difunctionalization reaction with no need for external CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; reagents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Vinylic Trifluoromethylselenolation via Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Trifluorometylselenolation via C&#8208;H activation is barely described in literature. In particular, no such vinylic functionalization has been yet described. Herein, a palladium&#8208;catalyzed trifluoromethylselenolation of vinylic C&#8208;H bonds is described. The 5&#8208;methoxy&#8208;8&#8208;aminoquinoline has been used as auxiliary directing group to perform this reaction. The reaction gives excellent yields with &#945;&#8208;substituted compounds whatever the substituents and a micro wave activation can be used to accelerate the reaction. With &#946;&#8208;substituted substrates lower yields, but still satisfactory, are obtained. This methodology was also successfully extended to other fluoroalkylselenyl groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Enantioenriched Sulfoxides by an Oxidation&#8208;Reduction Enzymatic Cascade</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral sulfoxides are versatile synthons and have gained a particular interest in asymmetric synthesis of active pharmaceutical and agrochemical ingredients. Herein we report a linear oxidation&#8208;reduction bienzymatic cascade to synthesize chiral sulfoxides. The extraordinarily stable and active vanadium&#8208;dependent chloroperoxidase from  Curvularia inaequalis  (  Ci  VCPO) was used to oxidize sulfides into racemic sulfoxides, which were then converted to chiral sulfoxides by highly enantioselective methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MsrA) and B (MsrB) via kinetic resolution, respectively. The combinatorial cascade yielded a broad range of structurally diverse sulfoxides with excellent optical purity (&gt; 99% ee) with complementary chirality. The enzymatic cascade requires no NAD(P)H recycling, representing a facile method for chiral sulfoxide synthesis. Particularly, the envisioned enzymatic cascade not only allows  Ci  VCPO to gain relevance in chiral sulfoxide synthesis, but also provide a powerful approach for (S)&#8208;sulfide synthesis, the latter case is significantly unexplored for heme&#8208;dependent peroxidases and peroxygenases.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 3&#8208;Borylated Pyrrolidines by 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition of Alkenyl Boronates and Azomethine Ylide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A scalable and efficient process for the preparation of 3&#8208;borylated pyrrolidines via the 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of in situ generated N&#8208;benzyl azomethine ylide was developed. The optimized method included the use of LiF in DMSO at 110&#160;&#176;C and was suitable for &#945;&#8208;mono&#8208;, &#945;,&#946;&#8208;di&#8208;, and &#945;,&#946;,&#946;&#8208;trialkyl&#8208;, &#946;,&#946;&#8208;(hetera)cycloalkylidene&#8208;, CO&#8322;Et&#8208;, as well as most &#946;&#8208;(het)aryl&#8208;substituted alkenyl boropinacola&#173;tes. The 1,3&#8208;dipolar reaction proceeded on multigram scale providing 3&#8208;borylated pyrrolidines with diverse substitution patterns (including fused and spirocyclic ones) in a diastereoselective manner. The Pd(OH)&#8322;&#8208;mediated N&#8208;debenzylation of pyrrolidine hydrochlorides was successfully performed to give the corresponding bifunctional building blocks on up to 130 g scale, thus providing a substantial expansion of the synthetic and medicinal chemist&#8217;s toolbox. Other reactions included the preparation of trifluoroborates, the Zweifel &#8211; Aggarwal sp&#179;&#8211; sp&#178;&#160;coupling, and oxidative deborylation as an example of C&#160;&#8211;&#160;heteroatom bond formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Infusion of variable chemical structure to tune stacking among metal&#8208;organic layers in 2D Nano MOF</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thickness of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) govern their intriguing functionalities. Primarily this thickness is controlled by the stacking between the metal&#8208;organic layers (MOL). It is observed that until now such modulating factors for stacking efficiency of MOL are still not well studied. Here, we report a fundamental hypothesis to comprehend regulation of stacking efficiency among MOLs as a function of chemical structure of organic ligands (dicarboxylic acids and pillar linkers). This basically involves a series of isostructural three&#8208;dimensional (3D) MOFs which contain linkers of variable chemical nature that could be depillared to generate 2D stacked MOFs of different thickness. Depending on the linkers, we encountered the formation of single MOL to stacked multiple MOLs as evidenced from atomic force microscopic and other experimental analysis. The present study gives a concrete correlation between the stacking within 2D MOFs (from monolayer to multilayers), and their 3D counter parts, which may provide a thickness tuning pathway for 2D MOFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving the Electrocatalytic Activity of Ni Organic Framework toward Oxygen Evolution Reaction by Vanadium Doping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been considered as a potential oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts, owning to their ultra&#8208;thin structure, adjustable composition, high surface area, and high porosity. Here, we designed and fabricated a vanadium&#8208;doped Ni organic frameworks (V1&#8208;x&#8208;NixMOF) system using a facile two&#8208;step solvothermal method on nickel foam (NF). The doping of V remarkably elevates the OER activity of V1&#8208;x&#8208;NixMOF, demonstrating better performance than the corresponding single metallic Ni&#8208;MOF, NiV&#8208;MOF and RuO2 catalysts at high current density (&gt;400 mA cm&#8208;2). V0.09&#8208;Ni0.91MOF/NF provides a low overpotential of 235 mV and a small Tafel slope of 30.3&#8201;mV dec&#8722;1 at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been considered as a potential oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts, owning to their ultra-thin structure, adjustable composition, high surface area, and high porosity. Here, we designed and fabricated a vanadium-doped Ni organic frameworks (V1-x-NixMOF) system using a facile two-step solvothermal method on nickel foam (NF). The doping of V remarkably elevates the OER activity of V1-x-NixMOF, demonstrating better performance than the corresponding single metallic Ni-MOF, NiV-MOF and RuO2 catalysts at high current density (&amp;gt;400 mA cm-2). V0.09-Ni0.91MOF/NF provides a low overpotential of 235 mV and a small Tafel slope of 30.3&#8201;mV dec&#8722;1 at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2. More importantly, the water splitting device assembled with Pt/C/NF and V0.09-Ni0.91MOF/NF as cathode and anode yield cell voltage of 1.96 V@1000 mA cm-2 outperforms the-state-of-the-art RuO2(+)||Pt/C(-). Our work sheds new insight into preparing stable, efficient OER electrocatalysts and a promising method for designing various MOF-based materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Development efficient strategy for fabrication of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal organic framework (MOF) nanosheets with high yield and high stability is desirable. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that large&#8208;size and single&#8208;layer 2D Ni&#8208;BDC MOF nanosheets have been fabricated with the assistance of supercritical carbon dioxide (SC CO2 ) in pure aqueous system. Detailed experimental evidences reveal that the SC CO2 molecule can exchange with the lattice coordinated H2O molecules and side&#8208;on coordinate with the metal Ni1 sites on nickel&#8208;benzene dicarboxylate (Ni&#8208;BDC) surface, and finally break the interlayer hydrogen bond to exfoliate the bulk Ni&#8208;BDC into 2D MOF. More importantly, a thin SC CO2 layer building at the water&#8208;Ni&#8208;BDC interfaces can transform the pristine hydrophilic interface to super&#8208;hydrophobic one. The formed super&#8208;hydrophobic layer at the water&#8211;MOF interface can effectively prevent the dissociation reaction, thus promoting the stability of Ni&#8208;BDC in aqueous system.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of metal chalcogenide semiconductors by thermal decomposition of organosulfur and organoselenium compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal chalcogenides &#8211; because of their excellent optical and electrical properties &#8211; are important semiconductor materials for optical devices, such as solar cells, sensors, and photocatalysts. The challenges associated with metal chalcogenides are the complexity of the conventional synthesis methods and the stringent synthesis conditions. In this study, we simplified the synthesis conditions using a solvent&#8208;free synthesis method using cadmium precursor, thiourea and selenium to synthesize metal chalcogenides, such as CdS and CdSe, which have particularly suitable band gaps for the optical devices. CdS  x  Se  1&#8208;x  solid solution was successfully synthesized under molten thiourea as the reactive reaction medium at relatively low temperatures, even at 180&#176;C, with residual melamine derivatives in the solid phase. The luminescence properties of CdS  x  Se  1&#8208;x  and the products in the gas and solid phases were investigated. Optimization of the synthesis conditions for solid solutions of CdS  x  Se  1&#8208;x  and the role of organic compounds in the formation of metal chalcogenides are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>A Macrocyclic Furan with Accessible Oxidation States: Switching Between Aromatic and Antiaromatic Global Ring Currents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocyclic furans are predicted to switch between global aromaticity and antiaromaticity, depending on their oxidation states. However, the macrocyclic furans reported to date are stabilized by electron withdrawing groups, which result in inaccessible oxidation states. To circumvent this problem, a post&#8208;macrocyclization approach was applied to introduce methylene&#8208;substituted macrocyclic furans, which display an extremely low oxidation potential of &#8208;0.23  vs  . Fc/Fc  +  , and are partially oxidized in ambient conditions. Additional oxidation to the dication results in aromaticity switching to a global 30&#960;e  &#8208;  aromatic state, as indicated by the formation of a strong diatropic current observed in the  1  H&#8208;NMR spectrum. NICS and ACID calculations support this trend and provide evidence for a different pathway for the global current in the neutral and dicationic states. According to these findings, macrocyclic furans can be rendered as promising  p  &#8208;type materials with stable oxidation states.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantification of the Electrophilicities of Diazoalkanes: Kinetics and Mechanism of Azo Couplings with Enamines and Sulfonium Ylides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enamines and sulfonium ylides attack the terminal nitrogen of diazoalkanes with rate&#8208;determining formation of zwitterions. The measured second&#8208;order rate constants were used to determine the one&#8208;bond electrophilicities E of the diazoalkanes. Pyrazolines obtained from the reactions of diazoalkanes with enamines are not formed by 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions, but by cyclization of hydrazonoenamines initially formed by proton shifts in the intermediate zwitterions.







Abstract
Kinetics and mechanism of the reactions of methyl diazoacetate, dimethyl diazomalonate, 4&#8208;nitrophenyldiazomethane, and diphenyldiazomethane with sulfonium ylides and enamines were investigated by UV&#8208;Vis and NMR spectroscopy. Ordinary alkenes undergo 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions with these diazo compounds. In contrast, sulfonium ylides and enamines attack at the terminal nitrogen of the diazo alkanes to give zwitterions, which undergo various subsequent reactions. As only one new bond is formed in the rate&#8208;determining step of these reactions, the correlation lg&#8201;k2(20&#8201;&#176;C)=sN(N+E) could be used to determine the one&#8208;bond electrophilicities E of the diazo compounds from the measured second&#8208;order rate constants and the known reactivity indices N and sN of the sulfonium ylides and enamines. The resulting electrophilicity parameters (&#8722;21&lt;E&lt;&#8722;18), which are 11&#8211;14 orders of magnitude smaller than that of the benzenediazonium ion, are used to define the scope of one&#8208;bond nucleophiles which may react with these diazoalkanes.

         <title>Between Two Chairs: Combination of Theory and Experiment for the Determination of the Conformational Dynamics of Xylosides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of experimental and computed data allows to disentangle and quantify complex dynamic conformational mixtures of xylosides. Computed spin&#8208;spin coupling constants bridge the gap between experimental NMR data and the conformer distribution.







Abstract
The conformational properties of monosaccharides constitute fundamental features of oligosaccharides. While the energy landscape of monosaccharides can be altered by a specific biochemical environment or by chemical modifications, the analysis of resulting dynamic conformational equilibria is not feasible by experimental means alone. In this work, a series of &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;xylopyranosides is used to outline how a combination of experimental NMR parameters and computed molecular properties can be used to determine conformers and quantify the composition of conformational equilibria. We demonstrate that identifying the most stable conformers using energy calculations is challenging and computing of NMR shieldings is typically not sensitive enough. On the other hand, computed spin&#8208;spin coupling constants for the xyloside ring can be used to unambiguously assign experimental NMR data of dynamic conformational equilibria and quantify the ratio of different conformers in the mixture. As a proof of principle, this procedure allowed to analyze a hitherto unknown dynamic equilibrium of a diamino&#8208;xyloside as a precursor of a molecular switch.

         <title>Cost&#8208;Effective 2D Ultrathin Metal&#8208;Organic Layers with Bis&#8208;Metallic Catalytic Sites for Visible Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work 2D ultrathin metal&#8208;organic layers (MOLs) with bis&#8208;metallic catalytic sites were developed to negate the blemish of low&#8208;density catalytic sites and low electron transmission efficiency on the surface of 3D MOFs, thus resulting in efficient and selective visible light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction by earth&#8208;abundant metal catalysis.







Abstract
As novel generated 2D materials, metal&#8208;organic layers (MOLs) have recently emerged as a potential platform for photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (PCO2RR). Such 2D structures negate the blemish of low&#8208;density catalytic sites and low electron transmission efficiency on the surface of metal organic frameworks (MOFs), while retaining the advantage of low expenditure when using earth&#8208;abundant metal nodes and meritorious applicability in the PCO2RR. Herein, it is reported that the 2D ultrathin layer material with bis&#8208;metallic catalytic sites (Ni&#8722;O metal node and the Ni&#8722;N metal site) from bidentate ligand 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;5,5&#8217;&#8208;dicarboxylate (H2bpydc) and nickel(II) remarkably boosts the visible light&#8208;driven PCO2RR performance with a CO yield of 2400&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 for 18&#8197;h and a selectivity up to 99&#8201;%. Consequently, the effects of morphology, catalytic sites and intrinsic properties on PCO2RR efficiency have been investigated in detail. In this context, the ultrathin layer structure has been elucidated as the key point to facilitate electron transfer efficiency. Notably, the bis&#8208;metallic catalytic sites with reasonable distance between two adjacent metals presumably induce synergistic effect and offer a guiding ideology for further designing high performance photocatalysts.

         <title>Acene Size&#8208;Dependent Transition of The Radical Centers From the Metal to The Acene Parts In Monocationic Dinuclear (Diethynylacene)diyl Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge&#8208;delocalization of various monocationic diruthenium (p&#8208;diethynylacene)diyl complexes was investigated. The distribution of the radical centers is dependent on the acene moieties; namely, the radical centers are shifted from the metal moiety (benzene) to the bridging dinuclear part (anthracene) and then to the acene part (pentacene).







Abstract
Controlling radical localization/delocalization is important for functional materials. The present paper describes synthesis and results of electrochemical, spectroscopic, and theoretical studies of diruthenium (p&#8208;diethynylacene)diyl complexes, Me3Si&#8208;(C&#8801;C)2&#8208;Ru(dppe)2&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8722;Ar&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8722;Ru(dppe)2&#8208;(C&#8801;C)2&#8208;SiMe3 (1&#8211;6) (dppe: 1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane), and their monocationic radical species ([1]+&#8211;[6]+). The HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gaps can be finely tuned by the acene rings in the bridging ligands installed, as indicated by the absorption maxima of the electronic spectra of 1&#8211;6 ranging from the UV region even to the NIR region. The cationic species [1]+&#8211;[6]+ show two characteristic NIR bands, which are ascribed to the charge resonance (CR) and &#960;&#8208;&#960;* transition bands, as revealed by spectroelectrochemistry. Expansion of the acene rings in [1]+&#8211;[6]+ causes (1) blue shifts of the CR bands and red shifts of the &#960;&#8208;&#960;* transition bands and (2) charge localization on the acene parts as evidenced by the ESR, DFT and TD&#8208;DFT analyses. Notably, the monocationic complexes of the larger acene derivatives are characterized as the non&#8208;classical acene&#8208;localized radicals.

         <title>Modulation of the sorption characteristics for an H&#8208;bonded porous architecture by varying the chemical functionalization of the channel walls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Five isostructural microporous supramolecular architectures prepared by H&#8208;bonded assembly between the hexa&#8208;anionic complex [Zr  2  (Ox)  7  ]  6&#8208;  (Ox = oxalate, (C  2  O  4  )  2&#8208;  ) and tripodal cations (H  3  &#8208;TripCH  2  &#8208;R)  3+  with R = H, CH  3  , OH and OBn (Bn = CH  2  Ph) are reported. The possibility to obtain the same structure using a mixture of tripodal cations with different R group (R = OH and R = CH  3  ) has also been successfully explored, providing a unique example of three&#8208;component H&#8208;bonded porous framework. The resulting SPA&#8208;1(R) materials feature 1D pores decorated by R groups, with apparent pore diameters ranging from 3.0 to 8.5 &#197;. Influence of R groups on the sorption properties of these materials is evidenced through CO  2  and H  2  O vapor sorption/desorption experiments, as well as with I  2  capture/release experiments in liquid media. This study is one of the first to demonstrate the possibility of tuning the porosity and exerting precise control over the chemical functionalization of the pores in a given H&#8208;bonded structure, without modifying the topology of the reference structure, and thus finely adjusting the sorption characteristics of the material.</dc:description>

The resulting SPA-1(R) materials feature 1D pores decorated by R groups, with apparent pore diameters ranging from 3.0 to 8.5 &#197;. Influence of R groups on the sorption properties of these materials is evidenced through CO  2  and H  2  O vapor sorption/desorption experiments, as well as with I  2  capture/release experiments in liquid media. This study is one of the first to demonstrate the possibility of tuning the porosity and exerting precise control over the chemical functionalization of the pores in a given H-bonded structure, without modifying the topology of the reference structure, and thus finely adjusting the sorption characteristics of the material.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecularly Imprinted Nanozymes with Free Substrate Access for Catalyzing the Ligation of ssDNA Sequences</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanozymes have attracted wide attention for the unique advantages of low cost, high stability and designability. Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) have demonstrated great potential as a new type of nanozymes due to their excellent specificity and high affinity. However, effective approaches for creating molecularly imprinted nanozymes still remain limited. Herein, we report a new approach called reverse microemulsion template docking surface imprinting (RMTD&#8208;SI) for the rational design and engineering of nanozymes with free substrate access for the ligation of ssDNA sequences. As a proof of the principle, octa&#8208;deoxyribonucleotide&#8208;imprinted nanoparticles were successfully prepared. Using tetradeoxyribonucleotides and octa&#8208;deoxyribonucleotide as substrates, the properties, catalytic activity and behaviors of the imprinted nanoparticles were thoroughly investigated. The imprinted nanozyme exhibited an enhanced reaction speed (by up to 41&#8208;fold) and good sequence selectivity towards substrate tetra&#8208;deoxyribonucleotides. More interestingly, due to the open substrate access, the imprinted nanozyme also allowed for catalyzing the ligation of a ssDNA that is fully complementary to the imprinted cavity to form longer sequences, but at the price of scarified substrate selectivity. Thus, this study provided not only a new avenue to the rational design and synthesis of molecularly imprinted nanozymes but also new insights of their catalytic behaviours.</dc:description>

         <title>Colloidal Stability of TiO2 Nanoparticles: The Roles of Phosphonate Ligand Length and Solution Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Don't go to any length: The hydrodynamic diameter was observed. In contrast to classical colloid theory, the dodecylphosphonate ligand provided better colloidal stability than the longer or shorter n&#8208;alkylphosphonate ligands. The proposed method is applicable to a wide range of colloidal nanoparticle systems.







Abstract
Surface ligands are essential tools for the stabilization of colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) in solvents. However, knowledge regarding the effects of the ligand shell, especially the ligand length, is insufficient and controversial. Here we demonstrate solution&#8208;based experiments on n&#8208;alkylphosphonate&#8208;capped TiO2 NPs to investigate the effects of ligand length and solution temperature on colloidal stability. A robust ligand&#8208;exchange process is achieved that draws free ligands and impurities away from the colloidal solution. In the case of 8&#8197;nm anatase NPs in toluene, the dodecylphosphonate ligand provided better colloidal stability than all the other n&#8208;alkylphosphonate ligands. In addition, relaxation studies suggested there is kinetic hysteresis in the dispersion/agglomeration transition. The proposed method is applicable to a wide range of surface ligands designed to maximize the colloidal stability of NPs.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we present the first atroposelective aminocatalytic methodology for the construction of C&#8211;N atropisomers. The synthesis of this class of axially chiral molecules typically encompasses substrates in which the C&#8211;N bond is pre&#8208;formed. In contrast, this work presents the direct coupling of indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxaldehydes and ortho&#8208;quinones, to form the stereogenic C&#8211;N axis in an atroposelective way. Application of typical aminocatalysts furnished the desired product, however, in low yields and as a complex mixture arising from poor regiocontrol among the C3&#8208; and N1&#8208;sites of the indole core. A new aminocatalyst was designed and synthesized with increased outer&#8208;sphere steric bulk to address these challenges&#8212;providing good levels of regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. A novel library of functionalized and enantioenriched C&#8211;N atropisomers was obtained and their synthetic utility was demonstrated by various transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Ru(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroarylation of in&#8197;situ Generated 3,3,3&#8208;Trifluoro&#8208;1&#8208;propyne by C&#8722;H Bond Activation: A Facile and Practical Access to &#946;&#8208;Trifluoromethylstyrenes</title>

         <dc:description>
An unprecedented Ru&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond hydroarylation of the in&#8197;situ generated 3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropyne from the inexpensive 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropene was developed to access &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethylstyrenes. A wide range of (hetero)arenes was functionalized leading selectively to the E&#8208;isomers. Detailed mechanistic studies and DFT calculations supported the involvement of an arene&#8208;free cyclometallated Ru(II) species and a bis&#8208;cyclometallated Ru complex as key intermediate.







Abstract
In this study, a practical and straightforward synthesis of &#946;&#8208;(E)&#8208;trifluoromethylstyrenes by ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activation was developed. The readily available and inexpensive 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropene (BTP), a non&#8208;ozone depleting reagent, was used as a reservoir of 3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropyne. With this approach, the monofunctionalization of a panel of heteroarenes was possible in a safe and scalable manner (23 examples, up to 87&#8201;% yield). Mechanistic investigations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were also conducted to get a better understanding of the mechanism of this transformation. These studies suggested that 1) a cyclometallated ruthenium complex enabled the transformation, 2) this complex exhibited high efficiency in this transformation compared to the commercially available [RuCl2(p&#8208;cymene)]2 and 3) the mechanism proceeded through a bis&#8208;cyclometallated ruthenium intermediate for the carboruthenation step.

         <title>Infrared Spectroscopy Elucidates the Inhibitor Binding Sites in a Metal&#8208;Dependent Formate Dehydrogenase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;dependent formate dehydrogenases (FDH) are capable of oxidizing formate to CO2 reversibly. Here, we compared IR spectroscopic data with DFT calculations and inhibition kinetics to study the putative binding mode of CO2/formate at the bis&#8208;MGD cofactor with the help of isoelectronic and charged product analogues. Experimental and theoretical data exclude a direct binding of the inhibitor molecules to the bis&#8208;MGD.







Abstract
Biological carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction is an important step by which organisms form valuable energy&#8208;richer molecules required for further metabolic processes. The Mo&#8208;dependent formate dehydrogenase (FDH) from Rhodobacter capsulatus catalyzes reversible formate oxidation to CO2 at a bis&#8208;molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide (bis&#8208;MGD) cofactor. To elucidate potential substrate binding sites relevant for the mechanism, we studied herein the interaction with the inhibitory molecules azide and cyanate, which are isoelectronic to CO2 and charged as formate. We employed infrared (IR) spectroscopy in combination with density functional theory (DFT) and inhibition kinetics. One distinct inhibitory molecule was found to bind to either a non&#8208;competitive or a competitive binding site in the secondary coordination sphere of the active site. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis of key amino acid residues in the vicinity of the bis&#8208;MGD cofactor revealed changes in both non&#8208;competitive and competitive binding, whereby the inhibitor is in case of the latter interaction presumably bound between the cofactor and the adjacent Arg587.

         <title>Intense Molar Circular Dichroism in Fully Conjugated All&#8208;Carbon Macrocyclic 1,3&#8208;Butadiyne Linked pseudo&#8208;meta [2.2]Paracyclophanes
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantiopure trimeric, tetrameric, pentameric, and hexameric macrocyclic 1,3&#8208;butadiyne linked pseudo&#8208;meta [2.2]paracyclophanes were synthesized by a homocoupling reaction in high yields and their photophysical properties were analyzed. Investigating the chiroptical properties revealed unrivalled molar circular dichroism values for all&#8208;carbon macrocycles and efficient through&#8208;space conjugation to reach astounding polymer&#8208;like conjugation lengths.







Abstract
The synthetic access to macrocyclic molecular topologies with interesting photophysical properties has greatly improved thanks to the successful implementation of organic and inorganic corner units. Based on recent reports, we realized that pseudo&#8208;meta [2.2]paracyclophanes (PCPs) might serve as optimal corner units for constructing 3D functional materials, owing to their efficient electronic communication, angled substituents and planar chirality. Herein, we report the synthesis, characterization and optical properties of four novel all&#8208;carbon enantiopure macrocycles bearing three to six pseudo&#8208;meta PCPs linked by 1,3&#8208;butadiyne units. The macrocycles were obtained by a single step from enantiopure, literature&#8208;known dialkyne pseudo&#8208;meta PCP and were unambiguously identified and characterized by state of the art spectroscopic methods and in part even by x&#8208;ray crystallography. By comparing the optical properties to relevant reference compounds, it is shown that the pseudo&#8208;meta PCP subunit effectively elongates the conjugated system throughout the macrocyclic backbone, such that already the smallest macrocycle consisting of only three subunits reaches a polymer&#8208;like conjugation length. Additionally, it is shown that the chiral pseudo&#8208;meta PCPs induce a remarkable chiroptical response in the respective macrocycles, reaching unprecedented high molar circular dichroism values for all&#8208;carbon macrocycles of up to 1307&#8197;L&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8197;cm&#8722;1.

         <title>1+1&gt;2: Fiber Synergy in Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fibers are ideal carriers for AIEgens towards realizing sophisticated optical functions. On the single fiber level, the integration of a multiple functional components into a fiber provides adjustable microenvironments to manipulate the aggregate state of AIEgens. On the multiple&#8208;fiber level, the assembly of multiple fiber offers entangled network to produce large&#8208;scale fabrics to endow AIEgens with amplified functions and practical values.







Abstract
Mesoscopic aggregate is important to transfer or even amplify the molecular information in macroscopic materials. As an important branch of aggregate science, aggregation&#8208;induced emissive luminogens (AIEgens) often show slight or even no emission in solutions but exhibit bright emission when they aggregate, which open a new avenue for the practical applications. Due to the flexible and rotor structure of AIEgens, the aggregate structure of AIEgens is highly sensitive to the surrounding microenvironment, resulting in adjustable optical properties. Fibers integrated of a multiplicity of functional components are ideal carriers to control the aggregation processes, further assembly of fibers produces large&#8208;scale fabrics with amplified functions and practical values. In this Concept article, we focus on the latest advances on the synergy between &#8220;AIE+Fiber&#8221; for the boosted performance that beyond AIE, and their applications are presented and abstracted out to stimulate new ideas for developing &#8220;AIE+Fiber&#8221; systems.

         <title>Stereoselective Activation of Small Molecules by a Stable Chiral Silene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel cyclic and chiral silene was synthesized and fully characterized. The chiral (S)&#8208;BINOL scaffold in the silene enabled unprecedented complete control over the diastereoselectivity in the reactions with different small molecules, S8, CO2 and HCl.







Abstract
The reaction of the dilithium salt of the enantiopure (S)&#8208;BINOL (1,1&#8217;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol) with two equivalents of the amidinate&#8208;stabilized chlorosilylene [LPhSiCl] (LPh=PhC(NtBu)2) led to the formation of the first example of a chiral cyclic silene species comprising an (S)&#8208;BINOL ligand. The reactivity of the Si=C bond was investigated by reaction with elemental sulfur, CO2 and HCl. The reaction with S8 led to a Si=C bond cleavage and concomitantly to a ring&#8208;opened product with imine and silanethione functional groups. The reaction with CO2 resulted in the cleavage of the CO2 molecule into a carbonyl group and an isolated O atom, while a new stereocenter is formed in a highly selective manner. According to DFT calculations, the [2+2] cycloaddition product is the key intermediate. Further reactivity studies of the chiral cyclic silene with HCl resulted in a stereoselective addition to the Si=C bond, while the fully selective formation of two stereocenters was achieved. The quantitative stereoselective addition of CO2 and HCl to a Si=C bond is unprecedented.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A novel cyclic&lt;/b&gt; and chiral silene was synthesized and fully characterized. The chiral (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-BINOL scaffold in the silene enabled unprecedented complete control over the diastereoselectivity in the reactions with different small molecules, S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and HCl.

&lt;p&gt;The reaction of the dilithium salt of the enantiopure (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-BINOL (1,1&#8217;-bi-2-naphthol) with two equivalents of the amidinate-stabilized chlorosilylene [L&lt;sup&gt;Ph&lt;/sup&gt;SiCl] (L&lt;sup&gt;Ph&lt;/sup&gt;=PhC(N&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) led to the formation of the first example of a chiral cyclic silene species comprising an (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-BINOL ligand. The reactivity of the Si=C bond was investigated by reaction with elemental sulfur, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and HCl. The reaction with S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; led to a Si=C bond cleavage and concomitantly to a ring-opened product with imine and silanethione functional groups.

         <title>Sterically Controlled Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization of Bulky Phosphines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the high affinity of phosphines for transition metals, C&#8722;H functionalization of aryl phosphines is dominated by phosphorous&#8208;directed reactions. Here we pair a sterically controlled borylation reaction of unprotected phosphines with phosphine self&#8208;assisted Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reactions to grant ready access to libraries of functionalized phosphines with a positional selectivity that complements existing methods. More information can be found in the Research Article by C.&#8197;N. Neumann et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202074).

         <title>C&#8722;H and Si&#8722;H Activation Reactions at Ru/Ga Complexes: A Combined Experimental and Theoretical Case Study on the Ru&#8722;Ga Bond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru/Ga compounds activate Si&#8722;H and C&#8722;H bonds. Triethylsilane and toluene are activated by the intermediate [Ru(GaCp*)3H2] and form the respective seven&#8208;fold coordinated Ru/Ga species. The bonding situation of the intermediate, the products, and their respective phosphine analogues are analyzed on the DFT level of theory, and the Ru&#8722;Ga and Ru&#8722;P bond are contrasted.







Abstract
Treatment of [Ru(COD)(MeAllyl)2] and [Ru(COD)(COT)] with GaCp* under hydrogenolytic conditions leads to reactive intermediates which activate Si&#8722;H or C&#8722;H bonds, respectively. The product complexes [Ru(GaCp*)3(SiEt3)H3] (1) and [Ru(GaCp*)3(C7H7)H3] (2) are formed with HSiEt3 or with toluene as the solvent, respectively. While 1 was isolated and fully characterized by NMR, MS, IR and SC&#8208;XRD, 2 was too labile to be isolated and was observed and characterized in&#8197;situ by using mass spectrometry, including labelling experiments for the unambiguous assignment of the elemental composition. The structural assignment was confirmed by DFT calculations. The relative energies of the four isomers possible upon toluene activation at the ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208;, para&#8208; and CH3&#8208;positions have been determined and point to aromatic C&#8722;H activation. The Ru&#8722;Ga bond was analyzed by EDA and QTAIM and compared to the Ru&#8722;P bond in the analogue phosphine compound. Bonding analyses indicate that the Ru&#8208;GaCp* bond is weaker than the Ru&#8208;PR3 bond.

         <title>Improved Reversible Zinc Storage Achieved in a Constitutionally Crystalline&#8208;Stable Mn(VO3)2 Nanobelts Cathode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystalline&#8208;stable Mn(VO3)2 nanobelts cathode presents the specific capacity of 350&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and maintain a capacity retention rate of 92&#8201;% for 10,000 cycles at a current density of 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. It also rendered good rate performance and obtained a reversible capacity of up to 200&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 600&#8197;cycles at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 even under &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. Benefiting from the unique tunnel type nanobelts structure, the Mn(VO3)2 nanobelts show high Zn2+ migration kinetics and stable framework for reversible ions de&#8208;/insertion.







Abstract
Rechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are potential for grid&#8208;scale applications owing to their safety, low price, and available sources. The development of ZIBs cathode with high specific capacity, wide operating voltage window and stable cyclability is urgently needed in next&#8208;generation commercial batteries. Herein, we report a structurally crystalline&#8208;stable Mn(VO3)2 nanobelts cathode for ZIBs prepared via a facile hydrothermal method. The as&#8208;synthesized Mn(VO3)2 exhibited high specific capacity of 350&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and maintained a capacity retention of 92&#8201;% after 10,000 cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. It also showed good rate performance and obtained a reversible capacity of up to 200&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 600 cycles at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 under &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. The electrochemical tests suggest that Mn(VO3)2 nanobelts impart fast Zn2+ ions migration, and the introduction of manganese atoms help make the structures more indestructible, leading to a good rate performance and prolonged cycle lifespan.

         <title>Heterolytic O&#8722;O Bond Cleavage Upon Single Electron Transfer to a Nonheme Fe(III)&#8722;OOH Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The one&#8208;electron reduction of a nonheme FeIII(OOH) intermediate results in the release of the FeII(OH) complex and O2, following a bimolecular reaction consistent with the disproportionation of the hydroperoxo ligand in a putative FeII(OOH) species. One plausible mechanistic scenario is that this disproportionation reaction follows an O&#8722;O heterolytic cleavage pathway via a FeIV&#8208;oxo species.







Abstract
The one&#8208;electron reduction of the nonheme iron(III)&#8208;hydroperoxo complex, [FeIII(OOH)(L52)]2+ (L52=N&#8208;methyl&#8208;N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine), carried out at &#8722;70&#8201;&#176;C results in the release of dioxygen and in the formation of [FeII(OH)(L52)]+ following a bimolecular process. This reaction can be performed either with cobaltocene as chemical reductant, or electrochemically. These experimental observations are consistent with the disproportionation of the hydroperoxo group in the putative FeII(OOH) intermediate generated upon reduction of the FeIII(OOH) starting complex. One plausible mechanistic scenario is that this disproportionation reaction follows an O&#8722;O heterolytic cleavage pathway via a FeIV&#8208;oxo species.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one-electron reduction of the nonheme iron(III)-hydroperoxo complex, [Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(OOH)(L&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (L&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methyl-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&#8217;&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&#8217;&lt;/i&gt;-tris(2-pyridylmethyl)ethane-1,2-diamine), carried out at &#8722;70&#8201;&#176;C results in the release of dioxygen and in the formation of [Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(OH)(L&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; following a bimolecular process. This reaction can be performed either with cobaltocene as chemical reductant, or electrochemically. These experimental observations are consistent with the disproportionation of the hydroperoxo group in the putative Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(OOH) intermediate generated upon reduction of the Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(OOH) starting complex. One plausible mechanistic scenario is that this disproportionation reaction follows an O&#8722;O heterolytic cleavage pathway via a Fe&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;-oxo species.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Optical Modulation of Antibiotic Resistance by Photoswitchable Cystobactamids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cystobactamids, natural products with potent antibiotic properties, have been equipped with mono&#8208; or double&#8208;photoswitches. Antibiotic and gyrase inhibition properties, but also the sensitivity towards the two resistance factors AlbD and and AlbA was light&#8208;dependent.







Abstract
The rise of antibiotic resistance causes a serious health care problem, and its counterfeit demands novel, innovative concepts. The combination of photopharmacology, enabling a light&#8208;controlled reversible modulation of drug activity, with antibiotic drug design has led to first photoswitchable antibiotic compounds derived from established scaffolds. In this study, we converted cystobactamids, gyrase&#8208;inhibiting natural products with an oligoaryl scaffold and highly potent antibacterial activities, into photoswitchable agents by inserting azobenzene in the N&#8208;terminal part and/or an acylhydrazone moiety near the C&#8208;terminus, yielding twenty analogs that contain mono&#8208; as well as double&#8208;switches. Antibiotic and gyrase inhibition properties could be modulated 3.4&#8208;fold and 5&#8208;fold by light, respectively. Notably, the sensitivity of photoswitchable cystobactamids towards two known resistance factors, the peptidase AlbD and the scavenger protein AlbA, was light&#8208;dependent. While irradiation of an analog with an N&#8208;terminal azobenzene with 365&#8197;nm light led to less degradation by AlbD, the AlbA&#8208;mediated inactivation was induced. This provides a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle that resistance towards photoswitchable antibiotics can be optically controlled.

         <title>Molybdenum(VI) Bis(imido) Complexes: From Frustrated Lewis Pairs to Weakly Coordinating Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Demonstration of how to teach well&#8208;known molybdenum bis(imido) complexes new and unexpected reactivities. These frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP) perform heterolytic dihydrogen splitting under ion pair formation consisting of molybdenum amido cations and hydroborates. They prove to be effective catalysts in the hydrosilylation of aldehydes. The molybdenum cations influence the outcome pointing towards their behaviour as weakly coordinating cations (WCCs).







Abstract
Molybdenum(VI) bis(imido) complexes [Mo(NtBu)2(LR)2] (R=H 1&#8201;a; R=CF3 1&#8201;b) combined with B(C6F5)3 (1&#8201;a/B(C6F5)3, 1&#8201;b/B(C6F5)3) exhibit a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) character that can heterolytically split H&#8722;H, Si&#8722;H and O&#8722;H bonds. Cleavage of H2 and Et3SiH affords ion pairs [Mo(NtBu)(NHtBu)(LR)2][HB(C6F5)3] (R=H 2&#8201;a; R=CF3 2&#8201;b) composed of a Mo(VI) amido imido cation and a hydridoborate anion, while reaction with H2O leads to [Mo(NtBu)(NHtBu)(LR)2][(HO)B(C6F5)3] (R=H 3&#8201;a; R=CF3 3&#8201;b). Ion pairs 2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b are catalysts for the hydrosilylation of aldehydes with triethylsilane, with 2&#8201;b being more active than 2&#8201;a. Mechanistic elucidation revealed insertion of the aldehyde into the B&#8722;H bond of [HB(C6F5)3]&#8722;. We were able to isolate and fully characterize, including by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, the inserted products Mo(NtBu)(NHtBu)(LR)2][{PhCH2O}B(C6F5)3] (R=H 4&#8201;a; R=CF3 4&#8201;b). Catalysis occurs at [HB(C6F5)3]&#8722; while [Mo(NtBu)(NHtBu)(LR)2]+ (R=H or CF3) act as the cationic counterions. However, the striking difference in reactivity gives ample evidence that molybdenum cations behave as weakly coordinating cations (WCC).

         <title>Chiral Motifs in Highly Interpenetrated Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Formed from Achiral Tetrahedral Ligands
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrahydral achiral ligands and copper ions assemble into a record number of interpenetrating diamondoid networks. The networks intertwine akin to strands of a molecular rope to shape the chiral channels. The design of the ligand &#8220;arms&#8221; allows modulating their degree of interpenetration and the channel properties. The concurrent presence of such numerous interpenetrated networks and porosity is unprecedented for metal&#8211;organic frameworks.







Abstract
Formation of highly interpenetrated frameworks is demonstrated. An interesting observation is the presence of very large adamantane&#8208;shaped cages in a single network, making these crystals new entries in the collection of diamondoid&#8208;type metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). The frameworks were constructed by assembling tetrahedral pyridine ligands and copper dichloride. Currently, the networks&#8217; degree of interpenetration is among the highest reported and increases when the size of the ligand is increased. Highly interpenetrated frameworks typically have low surface contact areas. In contrast, in our systems, the voids take up to 63&#8201;% of the unit cell volume. The MOFs have chiral features but are formed from achiral components. The chirality is manifested by the coordination chemistry around the metal center, the structure of the helicoidal channels, and the motifs of the individual networks. Channels of both handednesses are present within the unit cells. This phenomenon shapes the walls of the channels, which are composed of 10, 16, or 32 chains correlated with the degree of interpenetration 10&#8208;, 16&#8208;, and 32&#8208;fold, respectively. By changing the distance between the center of the ligand and the coordination moieties, we succeeded in tuning the diameter of the channels. Relatively large channels were formed, having diameters up to 31.0&#8197;&#197;&#215;14.8&#8197;&#197;.

         <title>Synchrotron X&#8208;ray Electron Density Analysis of Chemical Bonding in the Graphitic Carbon Nitride Precursor Melamine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Odd one out: Melamine is the precursor for the polycondensation reaction to graphitic carbon nitride materials with a range of important applications. It is found that one amine group in melamine is significantly different from the others, and based on extensive analysis of the experimental and theoretical electron density this particular amine group is suggested to be the origin of the condensation process.







Abstract
Melamine is a precursor and building block for graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;CN) materials, a group of layered materials showing great promise for catalytic applications. The synthetic pathway to g&#8208;CN includes a polycondensation reaction of melamine by evaporation of ammonia. Melamine molecules in the crystal organize into wave&#8208;like planes with an interlayer distance of 3.3&#8197;&#197; similar to that of g&#8208;CN. Here we present an extensive investigation of the experimental electron density of melamine obtained from modelling of synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal diffraction data measured at 25&#8197;K with special focus on the molecular geometry and intermolecular interactions. Both intra&#8208; and interlayer structures are dominated by hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;interactions. Theoretical gas&#8208;phase optimizations of the experimental molecular geometry show that bond lengths and angles for atoms in the same chemical environment (C&#8722;N bonds in the ring, amine groups) differ significantly more for the experimental geometry than for the gas&#8208;phase&#8208;optimized geometries, indicating that intermolecular interactions in the crystal affects the molecular geometry. In the experimental crystal geometry, one amine group has significantly more sp3&#8208;like character than the others, hinting at a possible formation mechanism of g&#8208;CN. Topological analysis and energy frameworks show that the nitrogen atom in this amine group participates in weak intralayer hydrogen bonding. We hypothesize that melamine condenses to g&#8208;CN within the layers and that the unique amine group plays a key role in the condensation process.

         <title>From CsKTaF7 to CsNaTaF7: Alkali Metal Cations Regulation to Generate SHG Activity
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new mixed&#8208;alkali metal tantalum fluorides CsATaF7 (A=K, Na) were synthesized by hydrothermal reactions based on the parent compounds A2MF7 (A=monovalent cations and M&#8208;d0 transition&#8208;metal cation). Interesting structure transformation for &#946;&#8208;K2TaF7, CsKTaF7, and CsNaTaF7 are induced via alkali metal cation regulations. Among them, CsNaTaF7 crystallizes in polar structure and own moderate SHG effect.







Abstract
Inorganic metal halides play important roles in wide range of areas including fluorescence, X&#8208;ray detection, and nonlinear&#8208;optics. Herein, two new mixed alkali metal tantalum fluorides, CsKTaF7 and CsNaTaF7, have been obtained based on the strategy of cations regulation in A2MF7 (A represents monovalent cations and M is d0 transition&#8208;metal cation) system by a conventional hydrothermal route. CsKTaF7 crystallizes in the centric Pnma space group, while CsNaTaF7 crystallizes in the polar Cmc21 space group and exhibits moderate and phase&#8208;matchable NLO activity. Both halides possess large optical band gaps above 5.0&#8197;eV. The crystal structure evolution, optical properties, and detailed theory calculations of these two halides were elucidated in this work.

         <title>Heavy Alkali Metal Manganate Complexes: Synthesis, Structures and Solvent&#8208;Induced Dissociation Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heavy alkali metal alkyls can form ate compounds with manganese bis(amides) when donor solvents are absent but introducing the common donors TMEDA or PMDETA leads to breakdown of the ates together with ligand exchange, which results in the formation of new solvated heavier alkali metal amides and alkylmanganese amides.







Abstract
Rare examples of heavier alkali metal manganates [{(AM)Mn(CH2SiMe3)(N&#8216;Ar)2}&#8734;] (AM=K, Rb, or Cs) [N&#8216;Ar=N(SiMe3)(Dipp), where Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3] have been synthesised with the Rb and Cs examples crystallographically characterised. These heaviest manganates crystallise as polymeric zig&#8208;zag chains propagated by AM&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;&#8208;arene interactions. Key to their preparation is to avoid Lewis base donor solvents. In contrast, using multidentate nitrogen donors encourages ligand scrambling leading to redistribution of these bimetallic manganate compounds into their corresponding homometallic species as witnessed for the complete Li &#8208; Cs series. Adding to the few known crystallographically characterised unsolvated and solvated rubidium and caesium s&#8208;block metal amides, six new derivatives ([{AM(N&#8216;Ar)}&#8734;], [{AM(N&#8216;Ar)&#8901;TMEDA}&#8734;], and [{AM(N&#8216;Ar)&#8901;PMDETA}&#8734;] where AM=Rb or Cs) have been structurally authenticated. Utilising monodentate diethyl ether as a donor, it was also possible to isolate and crystallographically characterise sodium manganate [(Et2O)2Na(nBu)Mn[(N&#8216;Ar)2], a monomeric, dinuclear structure prevented from aggregating by two blocking ether ligands bound to sodium.

         <title>Spectroscopic Signature of Dynamical Instability of the Aqueous Complex in the Brown&#8208;Ring Nitrate Test

Dynamical instabilities in the brown&#8208;ring test: Hydration dynamics around the iron nitrosyl moiety leads to an equilibrium between two complexes, with very different UV&#8208;vis spectra. Ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamics simulations and ab&#8208;initio multi&#8208;reference methods predict that classically established pseudo&#8208;octahedral [Fe(H2O)5(NO)]2+ complex is present along with a square&#8208;pyramidal [Fe(H2O)4(NO)]2+ complex in aqueous solution. The features of the experimental UV&#8208;vis spectrum can be theoretically reproduced only by accounting these two species and not the [Fe(H2O)5(NO)]2+ complex alone.







Abstract
The chemistry of the brown&#8208;ring test has been investigated for nearly a century. Though recent studies have focused on solid state structure determination and measurement of spectra, mechanistic details and kinetics, the aspects of solution structure and dynamics remain unknown. We have studied structural fluctuations of the brown&#8208;ring complex in aqueous solution with ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamics simulations, from which we identified that the classically established pseudo&#8208;octahedral [Fe(H2O)5(NO)]2+ complex is present along with a square&#8208;pyramidal [Fe(H2O)4(NO)]2+ complex. Based on the inability in multi&#8208;reference calculations to reproduce the experimental UV&#8208;vis spectra in aqueous solution by inclusion of thermal fluctuations of the [Fe(H2O)5(NO)]2+ complex alone, we propose the existence of an equilibrium between pseudo&#8208;octahedral and square&#8208;pyramidal complexes. Despite challenges in constructing models reproducing the solid&#8208;state UV&#8208;vis spectrum, the advanced spectrum simulation tool motivates us to challenge the established picture of a sole pseudo&#8208;octahedral complex in solution.

         <title>A Supramolecular Strategy for the Synthesis of Cyclic Oligomers and Polymers by Ring Expansion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of a thiourea derivative (the guest) to an unstrained, olefin&#8208;containing macrocycle (the monomer), in the presence of a Grubbs catalyst, initiates a rapid ring&#8208;expansion reaction. The role of the guest is to inhibit a ring&#8208;closing reaction back to the monomer and this leads to the selective formation of cyclic oligomers with molecular weights up to 6700&#8197;Da.







Abstract
Ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of strained macrocycles is a key method to prepare diverse polymers. However, lack of ring strain in most macrocycles is an impediment to polymerization. In this paper, the polymerization/oligomerization of unstrained macrocycles was achieved using a supramolecular approach, leading selectively to cyclic products. Diphenyl thiourea and other guest molecules were used as additives to the ROMP reaction of unstrained macrocycles. An intermediate host&#8208;guest complex leads to the stabilization of the open form of the macrocycle after treatment with Grubbs catalysts, thereby favoring polymerization by inhibiting the ring&#8208;closing reaction back to the monomer. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept enables ring&#8208;expansion polymerization of unstrained macrocycles leading to cyclic polymers with molecular weights up to 6700&#8197;Da.

         <title>Development of an Allenyne&#8208;Alkyne [4+2] Cycloaddition and its Application to Total Synthesis of Selaginpulvilin A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complex character of a strained molecule. the &#945;,3&#8208;dehydrotoluene generated via the [4+2] cycloaddition of allenyne&#8208;alkyne can be trapped with a hydrogen atom donor or nucleophiles with two opposite regioselectivity; oxygen nucleophiles are incorporated at the benzylic position whereas amine nucleophiles are incorporated onto the aromatic core. This unique reactivity and selectivity is exploited for selaginpuvilin synthesis.







Abstract
A new [4+2] cycloaddition of allenyne&#8208;alkyne is developed. The reaction is believed to proceed with forming an &#945;,3&#8208;dehydrotoluene intermediate. This species behaves as a &#963;&#960;&#8208;diradical to react with a hydrogen atom donor, whereas it displays a zwitterionic reactivity toward weak nucleophiles. The efficiency of trapping &#945;,3&#8208;dehydrotoluene depends not only on its substituents but also the trapping agents. Notable features of the reaction are the activating role of the extra alkyne of the 1,3&#8208;diyne that reacts with the allenyne moiety and the opposite mode of trapping with oxygen and nitrogen nucleophiles. Oxygen nucleophiles result in the oxygen&#8208;end incorporation at the benzylic position of the &#945;,3&#8208;dehydrotoluene, whereas with amine nucleophiles the nitrogen&#8208;end is incorporated into the aromatic core. Relying on the allenyne&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition as an enabling strategy, a concise total synthesis of phosphodiesterase&#8208;4 inhibitory selaginpulvilin A is realized.

         <title>New Opportunities for the Utilization of the Sulfoximine Group in Medicinal Chemistry from the Drug Designer's Perspective
</title>

         <dc:description>
The sulfoximine group has emerged from a &#8216;lab oddity&#8217; to become a &#8216;rising star in modern drug discovery&#8217;. Even though the increasing interest in this versatile functional group in recent years has resulted in several sulfoximine clinical candidates, there is ample room for further innovative applications. This minireview highlights emerging trends and opportunities for drug designers for the utilization of the sulfoximine group, such as in the construction of complex molecules, PROTACs, ADCs and novel warheads for covalent inhibition.







Abstract
Extension of the medicinal chemistry toolbox is in the vital interest of drug designers. However, the diffusion of an innovation can be a lengthy process. Along these lines, it took almost 70&#8197;years before the use of the sulfoximine group reached a critical mass in medicinal chemistry. Even though interest in this versatile functional group has increased exponentially in recent years, there is ample room for further innovative applications. This Review highlights emerging trends and opportunities for drug designers for the utilization of the sulfoximine group in medicinal chemistry, such as in the construction of complex molecules, proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs), antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs) and novel warheads for covalent inhibition.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ambitious goal of artificial photosynthesis is to develop active systems that mimic nature and use light to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. Intramolecular design concepts are particularly promising. Herein, we firstly present an intramolecular photocatalyst integrating a perylene&#8208;based light&#8208;harvesting moiety and a catalytic rhodium center (  Rh  III  phenPer  ). The excited&#8208;state dynamics were investigated by means of steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved absorption and emission spectroscopy. The studies reveal that photoexcitation of  Rh  III  phenPer  yields the formation of a charge&#8208;separated intermediate, namely  Rh  II  phenPer  &#9679;+  , that results in a catalytically active species in the presence of protons.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Palladium&#8208;catalyzed [5+2] annulation of 1&#8208;bora&#173;phenalenes with  ortho  &#8208;dihaloarenes afforded negatively curved &#960;&#8208;extended pleiadienes. Two benzo[1,2&#8208;  i  :4,5&#8208;  i  &#8217;]&#173;di&#173;pleiadienes (BDPs) featuring a seven&#8211;six&#8211;seven&#8208;membered ring arrangement were synthesized and investigated. Their crystal structure revealed a unique packing arrangement and theoretical calculations were employed to shed light onto the dynamic behavior of the BDP moiety and its aromaticity. Further, a naphthalene&#8208;fused pleiadiene was stitched together by oxidative cyclo&#173;dehydrogenation to yield an additional five&#8208;membered ring. This formal azulene moiety leads to distinct changes in optical and redox properties and increased perturbation of the aromatic system.</dc:description>

         <title>Bimetallic Ruthenium Nitrosyl Complexes with Enhanced Two&#8208;Photon Absorption Properties for Nitric Oxide Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One monometallic and three bimetallic ruthenium nitrosyl (RuNO) complexes are presented and fully characterized in reference to a parent monometallic complex of formula [FTRu(bpy)(NO)]  3+  , where FT is a fluorenyl&#8208;substituted terpyridine ligand, and bpy the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine. These new complexes are built with the new ligands FFT, TFT, TFFT, and TF&#8208;CC&#8208;TF (where an alkyne C&#8801;C group is inserted between two fluorenes). The crystal structures of the bis&#8208;RuNO  2  and bis&#8208;RuNO complexes built from the TFT ligand are presented. The evolution of the spectroscopic features (intensities and energies) along the series, at one&#8208;photon absorption (OPA) correlates well with the TD&#8208;DFT computations. A spectacular effect is observed at two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) with a large enhancement of the molecular cross&#8208;section (&#963;  TPA  ), in the bimetallic species. In the best case, &#963;  TPA  is equal to 1523 &#177; 98 GM at 700 nm, in the therapeutic window of transparency of biological tissues. All compounds are capable of releasing NO  &#8226;  under irradiation, which leads to promising applications in TPA&#8208;based drug delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>The Radical Anion, Dianion and Electron Transport Properties of Tetraiodotetraazapentacene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetraiodotetraazapentacene  I  4  TAP  , the last missing derivative in the series of halogenated silylated tetraazapentacenes, was synthesized via condensation chemistry from a TIPS&#8208;ethynylated diaminobenzothiadiazol in three steps. Single and double reduction furnished its air&#8208;stable monoanion and relatively air&#8208;stable dianion, both of which were characterized by crystallography. All three species are structurally and spectroscopically compared to non&#8208;halogenated  TAP  and  Br  4  TAP. I  4  TAP  is an n&#8208;channel material in thin&#8208;film transistors with average electron mobilities exceeding 1 cm  2  (Vs)  &#8208;1  .</dc:description>

         <title>Fabrication of highly luminescent and thermally stable phosphors through in&#8208;situ formation of BaSO4 on sulfur nanodots</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Producing high performance phosphors using abundant and non&#8208;toxic precursors yet straightforward methods are promising but still a challenging task.  Herein, highly luminescent and thermally stable phosphors were fabricated through an in&#8208;situ precipitation synthesis strategy. Sulfur nanodots (S&#8208;dots) act as the precursors for precipitation reactions and also provide the luminescent centers. Structural and optical characterization investigations suggest that S&#8208;dots are incorporated in the matrix of BaSO  4  , and BaSO  4  provides passivation effect for the surface ligands or traps of S&#8208;dots. This results in the promotion of photoluminescence quantum yield from 23% to 58%, and the BaSO  4  matrix also leads to the obvious promotion of thermal stability. These merits endow the construction of phosphor&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes by utilizing the S&#8208;dots@BaSO  4  hybrid phosphors as a color conversion layer. These research results are significant for developing sulfur&#8208;based luminescent materials, and also provide a solid and universal theory to produce high quality phosphors.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Aerobic Intermolecular 1,2&#8208;Diamination of Conjugated Dienes: Regio&#8208; and Chemoselective Synthesis of Piperazines and 2&#8208;Piperazinones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dinitrogen heterocycles are among&#160;the most important molecular structures, and the synthesis of these types of structures through intermolecular 1,2&#8208;diamination of olefins is a direct and efficient method. However, the types of nitrogen sources are mostly derived from ureas or arylamines, and nitrogen sources from aliphatic amines are still limited due to their distinct electronic and steric effects. Herein, we report a palladium&#8208;catalyzed aerobic intermolecular 1,2&#8208;diamination of conjugated dienes, using ethanediamine and  &#945;&#8208;amino amide derivatives as nitrogen sources respectively, for the synthesis of piperazines and 2&#8208;piperazinones in good yields (up to 95%)&#160;and with high regio&#8208; and chemoselectivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Elastin&#8208;Hyaluronan Bioconjugate as Bioactive Component in Electrospun Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hyaluronic acid or hyaluronan (HA) and elastin&#8208;inspired peptides (EL) have been widely recognized as bioinspired materials useful in biomedical applications. The aim of the present work is the production of electrospun scaffolds as wound dressing materials which would benefit from synergic action of the bioactivity of elastin peptides and the regenerative properties of hyaluronic acid. Taking advantage of thiol&#8208;ene chemistry, a bioactive elastin peptide was successfully conjugated to methacrylated hyaluronic acid (MAHA) and electrospun together with poly&#8208;D,L&#8208;lactide (PDLLA). To the best of our knowledge, limited reports on peptide&#8208;conjugated hyaluronic acid were described in literature, and none of these was employed for the production of electrospun scaffolds. The conformational studies carried out by Circular Dichroism (CD) on the bio&#8208;conjugated compound confirmed the preservation of secondary structure of the peptide after conjugation while Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) revealed the supramolecular structure of the electrospun scaffolds. Overall, the study demonstrates that the bioconjugation of hyaluronic acid with the elastin peptide improved the electrospinning processability with improved characteristics in terms of morphology of the final scaffolds</dc:description>

         <title>Terminal N2&#8208;Dissociation in [(PNN)Fe(N2)]2(&#956;&#8208;N2) Leads to Local Spin&#8208;State Changes and Augmented Bridging N2 Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogen fixation at iron centres is a fundamental catalytic step for N 2 utilisation, relevant to biological (nitrogenase) and industrial (Haber&#8208;Bosch) processes. This step is coupled with important electronic structure changes which are currently poorly understood. We show here for the first time that terminal dinitrogen dissociation from iron complexes that coordinate N 2 in a terminal and bridging fashion leaves the Fe&#8208;N 2 &#8208;Fe unit intact but significantly enhances the degree of N 2 activation (&#916;&#957; &#8776; 180 cm &#8208;1 , Raman spectroscopy) through charge redistribution. The transformation proceeds with local spin state change at the iron centre (S=&#8543; 2 &#8594; S= 3 &#8725; 2 ). Further dissociation of the bridging N 2 can be induced under thermolytic conditions, triggering a disproportionation reaction, from which the tetrahedral (PNN) 2 Fe could be isolated. This work shows that dinitrogen activation can be induced in the absence of external chemical stimuli such as reducing agents or Lewis acids.</dc:description>

The reaction proceeds with excellent selectivity for boron addition to the external carbon of the 1,3&#8208;diyne framework as unambiguously established by NMR and X&#8208;ray crystallography studies. The reaction displays a broad substrate scope including unsymmetrical diynes to generate products in high yield (up to 95%). Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that phosphine attack on the alkyne is key in the catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Alkylation of Cyclic Ketones with Dehydroalanine via H&#8208;Bond&#8208;Directing Enamine Catalysis: Straightforward Access to Enantiopure Unnatural &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The growing importance of structurally diverse and functionalized enantiomerically pure unnatural amino acids in the design of drugs, including peptides, has stimulated the development of new synthetic methods. Herein, we report the challenging direct asymmetric alkylation of cyclic ketones with dehydroalanine derivatives via a conjugate addition reaction for the synthesis of enantiopure ketone&#8208;based &#945;&#8208;unnatural amino acids. The key to success was the design of a bifunctional primary amine&#8208;thiourea catalyst that combines H&#8208;bond&#8208;directing activation and enamine catalysis. The simultaneous dual activation of the two relatively unreactive partners, confirmed by mass spectrometry studies, results in high reactivity while securing high levels of stereocontrol. A broad substrate scope is accompanied by versatile downstream chemical modifications. The mild reaction conditions and consistently excellent enantioselectivities (&gt;95% ee in most cases) render this protocol highly practical for the rapid construction of valuable noncanonical enantiopure &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;acid building blocks.</dc:description>

         <title>Branched Tertiary Amines from&#160; &#945;&#8208;Olefins by Combined Multiphase Tandem Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present the transformation of olefins to branched amines by combining a hydroformylation/aldol condensation tandem reaction with the reductive amination in a combined multiphase system that can be recycled 9 times. The products are branched amines that are precursors for surfactants. Since the multiphase hydroformylation/aldol condensation system has already been studied, the first step was to develop the partial hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes together with a subsequent reductive amination. The rhodium/phosphine catalyst is immobilized in a polar polyethylene phase which separates from the product phase after the reaction. Reaction and catalyst recycling are demonstrated by the conversion of the C14&#8208;aldehyde 2&#8208;pentylnonenal with the dimethylamine surrogate dimethylammonium dimethyl&#173;carbamate to the corresponding tertiary amine with yields up to 88% and an average rhodium leaching of less than 0.1% per recycling run. Furthermore, the positive influence of a Bronsted acid and carbon monoxide on the selectivity are discussed. Finally, the two PEG based systems have been merged in one recycling approach, by using the product phase of the hydroformylation aldol condensation reaction for the reductive amination reaction. The yields are stable during a nine recycling runs and the leaching low with 0.09% over the two recycling stages.</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of Fluoroalkyl Substituents on the Physicochemical Properties of Saturated Heterocyclic Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The replacement of azetidine, pyrrolidine, and piperidine with their fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted analogs was shown to modulate basicity, lipophilicity and aqueous solubility. Comprehensive analysis of the obtained physicochemical data was carried out to guide rational fine&#8208;tuning of compounds&#8217; properties related to drug optimization.







Abstract
The physicochemical properties (pKa(H), log&#8201;P, and aqueous solubility) of fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted heterocyclic amines were profiled to facilitate the amines&#8217; rational application in medicinal chemistry research. The features of fluorine&#8208;containing compounds were compared to those of the corresponding parent non&#8208;fluorinated heterocycles and the corresponding fluorinated n&#8208;alkylamines. Amine basicity was observed to change in a monotonic fashion depending on the fluorination pattern. Although the introduction of fluoroalkyl groups had complex effects on the lipophilicity and aqueous solubility of the compounds, possible contributions of the fluorination pattern, ring size, and conformation of the substituent in the ring were addressed for a series of derivatives. The summarized data provide a useful guideline for the application of fluorinated motifs for fine&#8208;tuning a compound's properties related to drug discovery.

         <title>Reversible Photoinduced Conversion of Unprecedented Norbornadiene&#8208;Based Photoswitches with Redox&#8208;Active Naphthalene Diimide Functionalities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of new photoswitches based on functional NBD&#8208;NDI&#8208;hybrid structures were synthesized and were reversibly switched between their two isomeric states. The photo&#8208;induced conversion, enabled by the redox&#8208;active NDI building block, was investigated in dependency of spacer length and concentration. The experimental results and proposed mechanistic pathway were supported by the conducted DFT calculations.







Abstract
An unprecedented compound class of functional organic hybrids consisting of a photoswitchable norbornadiene building block and a redoxactive chromophore, namely naphthalene diimide, were designed and synthesized. Within these structures the capability of rylene chromophores to function as a redox active catalyst upon their photoexcitation was utilized to initiate the oxidative back&#8208;conversion of the in&#8197;situ formed quadricyclane unit to its norbornadiene analogue. In this way successive photoexcitation at two different wavelengths enabled a controlled photoswitching between the two isomerical states of the hybrids. Beyond this prove of concept, the dependency of the reaction rate to the intramolecular distance of the two functional molecular building blocks as well as the concentration of the photoexcited sample was monitored. The experimental findings and interpretations were furthermore supported by quantum chemical investigations.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Induced Selectivity Switch in Gold Catalysis: Fast Access to Indolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinolines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An entropy&#8208;induced selectivity switch in the gold&#8208;catalyzed hydroarylation of 2&#8208;ethynyl N&#8208;aryl indoles was discovered, and the investigation by experimental and computational mechanistic studies led to a full explanation of the observed temperature&#8208;dependent selectivity. The in this context introduced methodology allows versatile access to indolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinolines, which are highly fluorescent dyes with appealing photophysical properties making them promising candidates for OLED applications.







Abstract
New N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds for organic functional materials and their efficient syntheses are highly demanded. A surprising entropy&#8208;induced selectivity switch in the gold&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular hydroarylation of 2&#8208;ethynyl N&#8208;aryl indoles was found and its exploitation led to straightforward syntheses of indolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinolines. Experimental and computational mechanistic investigations gave insight into this uncommon selectivity phenomenon and into the special reactivity of the indolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinolines. The high functional group tolerance of this methodology enabled access to a diverse scope with high yields. In addition, bidirectional approaches, post&#8208;functionalization reactions, and &#960;&#8208;extension of the core structure were feasible. An in&#8208;depth study of the photophysical properties explored the structure&#8208;effect relationship for different derivatives and revealed a high potential of these compounds for future applications as functional materials.

Catalysed carbon bond formation: A nickel&#8208;catalysed reductive cross&#8208;coupling reaction between benzyl sulfonium salts and benzyl bromides is reported. Simple, stable and readily available sulfonium salts have shown their ability as leaving groups in cross&#8208;electrophile coupling, allowing the construction of challenging sp3&#8211;sp3 carbon&#8208;carbon bonds, towards the synthesis of interesting dihydrostilbene derivatives.

Hooked on c&#8208;myc: A series of organoplatinum(II) compounds with diverse amino&#8208;acid&#8208;inspired side&#8208;chains exhibit high affinity and binding selectivity for the c&#8208;myc G&#8208;quadruplex, along with significant emission enhancement and optical selectivity for this target vs. other DNA topologies. The compounds behave as efficient c&#8208;myc G&#8208;quadruplex stabilizers. Insights on the nature of their interaction with c&#8208;myc were gained via resonance Raman investigation and docking simulation studies, highlighting the importance of the side&#8208;chains for the interaction.







Abstract
Organometallic molecules offer some of the most promising scaffolds for interaction with G&#8208;quadruplex nucleic acids. We report the efficient synthesis of a family of organoplatinum(II) complexes, featuring a 2&#8208;([2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridin]&#8208;6&#8208;yl)phenyl tridentate (N&#8743;N&#8743;C) ligand, that incorporates peripheral side&#8208;chains aiming at enhancing and diversifying its interaction capabilities. These include a di&#8208;isopropyl carbamoyl amide, a morpholine ethylenamide, two enantiomeric proline imides and an oxazole. The binding affinities of the Pt&#8208;complexes were evaluated via UV&#8208;vis and fluorescence titrations, against 5 topologically&#8208;distinct DNA structures, including c&#8208;myc G&#8208;quadruplex, two telomeric (22AG) G&#8208;quadruplexes, a duplex (ds26) and a single&#8208;stranded (polyT) DNA. All compounds exhibited binding selectivity in favour of c&#8208;myc, with association constants (Ka) in the range of 2&#8211;5&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1, lower affinity for both folds of 22AG and for ds26 and negligible affinity for polyT. Remarkable emission enhancements (up to 200&#8208;fold) upon addition of excess DNA were demonstrated by a subset of the compounds with c&#8208;myc, providing a basis for optical selectivity, since optical response to all other tested DNAs was low. A c&#8208;myc DNA&#8208;melting experiment showed significant stabilizing abilities for all compounds, with the most potent binder, the morpholine&#8208;Pt&#8208;complex, exhibiting a &#916;Tm&gt;30&#8201;&#176;C, at 1&#8201;:&#8201;5 DNA&#8208;to&#8208;ligand molar ratio. The same study implied contributions of the diverse side&#8208;chains to helix stabilization. To gain direct evidence of the nature of the interactions, mixtures of c&#8208;myc with the four most promising compounds were studied via UV Resonance Raman (UVRR) spectroscopy, which revealed end&#8208;stacking binding mode, combined with interactions of side&#8208;chains with loop nucleobase residues. Docking simulations were conducted to provide insights into the binding modes for the same four Pt&#8208;compounds, suggesting that the binding preference for two alternative orientations of the c&#8208;myc G&#8208;quadruplex thymine &#8216;cap&#8217; (&#8216;open&#8217; vs. &#8216;closed&#8217;), as well as the relative contributions to affinity from end&#8208;stacking and H&#8208;bonding, are highly dependent on the nature of the interacting Pt&#8208;complex side&#8208;chain.

         <title>Sterically Controlled Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization of Bulky Phosphines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the high affinity of phosphines for transition metals, C&#8722;H functionalization of aryl phosphines is dominated by phosphorus&#8208;directed reactions. Here, we pair a sterically controlled borylation reaction of unprotected phosphines with phosphine self&#8208;assisted Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reactions to grant ready access to libraries of functionalized phosphines with a positional selectivity that complements existing methods.







Abstract
The fine&#8208;tuning of metal&#8208;phosphine&#8208;catalyzed reactions relies largely on accessing ever more precisely tuned phosphine ligands by de&#8208;novo synthesis. Late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization and diversification of commercial phosphines offers rapid access to entire libraries of derivatives based on privileged scaffolds. But existing routes, relying on phosphorus&#8208;directed transformations, only yield functionalization of C
&#8722;H bonds in a specific position relative to phosphorus. In contrast to phosphorus&#8208;directed strategies, herein we disclose an orthogonal functionalization strategy capable of introducing a range of substituents into previously inaccessible positions on arylphosphines. The strongly coordinating phosphine group acts solely as a bystander in the sterically controlled borylation of bulky phosphines, and the resulting borylated phosphines serve as the supporting ligands for palladium during diversification through phosphine self&#8208;assisted Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reactions.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Due to the high affinity&lt;/b&gt; of phosphines for transition metals, C&#8722;H functionalization of aryl phosphines is dominated by phosphorus-directed reactions. Here, we pair a sterically controlled borylation reaction of unprotected phosphines with phosphine self-assisted Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reactions to grant ready access to libraries of functionalized phosphines with a positional selectivity that complements existing methods.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Artificial Antiferromagnets Possessing Extended Zero&#8208;, One&#8208;, Two&#8208;, and Three&#8208;Dimensional Structures</title>

         <dc:description>
Antiferromagnetic coupling of ferro&#8208; or ferrimagnetically ordered isolated ions (0D), extended chain (1D), layer (2D), or 3D&#8208;network structures can lead to antiferromagnetically ordered materials, which are referred to as artificial (or synthetic) antiferromagnets.







Abstract
Layered (2D) artificial (or synthetic) antiferromagnets are fabricated by atom deposition techniques and possess very thin, nanometer&#8208;scale, magnetically ordered layers separated by a very thin nonmagnetic layer that antiferromagnetically couples the magnetic layers. Artificial antiferromagnets were crucial in the discovery of the giant magnetic effect (GMR), which had an incredible impact on the evolution of computer memory and its applications, and nucleated the dawn of spintronics (magnetoelectrics). The fundamental structural motif has been more recently achieved by using synthetic chemical methods that led to insulating artificial antiferromagnets. Examples of magnetically ordered layers that are antiferromagnetic coupled to form artificial antiferromagnets have been extended to isolated ions (0D) as well as extended chain (1D) and extended network 3D structures, and new phenomena and applications are anticipated as insulating antiferromagnets are more effective at propagating spin currents with respect to dielectric materials.

         <title>Ultralow&#8208;Loading and High&#8208;Performing Ionic Liquid&#8208;Immobilizing Rhodium Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Hydroformylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A keggin polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;based ionic liquid immobilizing rhodium single&#8208;atom Rh catalyst exhibits an outstanding catalytic activity for styrene hydroformylation; both the conversion and the yield of aldehyde can reach almost 99&#8201;%, and a TOF was obtained as high as 9000&#8197;h&#8722;1 without using any phosphine ligand in the reaction process.







Abstract
We have developed a Keggin polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;based ionic&#8208;liquid (IL)&#8208;immobilizing rhodium single&#8208;atom Rh catalyst (MTOA)5[SiW11O39Rh] (MOTA=methyltrioctylammonium cation) that can afford exceptionally high catalytic activity for the hydroformylation of alkenes to produce aldehydes at an ultralow loading of Rh (ca. 3&#8197;ppm). For styrene hydroformylation, both the conversion and the yield of the aldehyde can reach almost 99&#8201;%, and a TOF as high as 9000&#8197;h&#8722;1 was obtained without using any phosphine ligand in the reaction process. Further characterization by FTIR, ICP and ESI&#8208;MS analysis revealed that the single Rh atom was incorporated in the lacunary POM anions. In particular, the bulky IL cation can play an additional role in stabilizing Rh species and thus prevent aggregation and leaching of Rh species. The IL catalyst was miscible with n&#8208;hexane at temperatures; this contributed to exceptionally high activity for hydroformylation even at ultra&#8208;low loading of IL catalyst.

         <title>A Rapid, Highly Sensitive and Selective Phosgene Sensor Based on 5,6&#8208;Pinenepyridine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phosgene sensor based on 5,6&#8208;pinenepyridine was developed. This sensor shows remarkable selectivity and sensitivity down to 9.7&#8197;nM/0.8&#8197;ppb in solution, with a response time of under 5&#8197;seconds. When fixed on a solid support, gaseous phosgene is detected down to concentrations of 0.1&#8197;ppm.







Abstract
The toxicity of phosgene (COCl2) combined with its extensive use as a reactant and building block in the chemical industry make its fast and accurate detection a prerequisite. We have developed a carboxylic derivative of 5,6&#8208;pinenepyridine which is able to act as colorimetric and fluorimetric sensor for phosgene in air and solution. For the first time, the formation of a pyrido&#8208;[2,1&#8208;a]isoindolone was used for this purpose. In solution, the sensing reaction is extremely fast (under 5&#8197;s), selective and highly sensitive, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 9.7&#8197;nM/0.8&#8197;ppb. When fixed on a solid support, the sensor is able to detect the presence of gaseous phosgene down to concentrations of 0.1&#8197;ppm, one of the lowest values reported to date.

         <title>Transformations of Strained Three&#8208;Membered Rings a Common, Yet Overlooked, Motif in Heavy&#8208;Atom Tunneling Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tunnel vision: The (trans)formation of three&#8208;membered rings is identified as a motif present in the majority of computationally and experimentally studied examples of heavy&#8208;atom tunneling. The reasons for this phenomenon are analyzed through a survey of different types of ring transformations throughout the tunneling literature.







Abstract
Quantum mechanical tunneling has long been recognized as an important phenomenon when considering transformations dominated by a lightweight hydrogen atom. Tunneling of heavier atoms like carbon, initially dismissed as negligible, has seen a quickly increasing number of computationally predicted and/or experimentally confirmed examples over the last decade, thus highlighting its importance for a wide variety of reactions. However, no common structural motif has been pointed out within these seemingly unconnected examples, strongly limiting the predictability of the impact of heavy&#8208;atom tunneling on a given reaction. This Concept article will provide this perspective and showcase how the recognition of the formation and cleavage of three&#8208;membered rings as common motif can inform the prediction of and research into heavy&#8208;atom tunneling reactions.

The built&#8208;in electric field formed in NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;101(Fe)/Ti3C2Tx Schottky&#8208;heterojunction hybrids coupled with in&#8197;situ photo&#8208;Fenton&#8208;like reactions to remove phenolic pollution under the visible light irradiation is described.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with abundant active sites, a class of materials composed of metal nodes and organic ligands, is widely used for photocatalytic degradation of pollutants. However, the rapid recombination of photoinduced carriers of MOFs limits its photocatalytic degradation performance. Herein, Ti3C2Tx nanosheets&#8208;based NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;101(Fe) hybrids with Schottky&#8208;heterojunctions were fabricated by in&#8197;situ hydrothermal assembly for improved photocatalytic activity. The photodegradation efficiencies of the NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;101(Fe)/Ti3C2Tx (N&#8208;M/T) hybrids for phenol and chlorophenol were 96.36&#8201;% and 99.83&#8201;% within 60&#8197;minutes, respectively. The N&#8208;M/T Schottky&#8208;heterojunction duly transferred electrons to the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets surface via built&#8208;in electric fields, effectively suppressing the recombination of photogenerated carriers, thereby improving the photocatalytic performance of NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;101(Fe). Moreover, the Fe&#8208;mixed&#8208;valence in the N&#8208;M/T led to improvement in the efficiency of the in&#8197;situ generated photo&#8208;Fenton reactions, further enhancing the photocatalytic activity with more generated reactive oxygen species (ROS). The study proposes a highly effective removal of phenolic pollutants in wastewater.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with abundant active sites, a class of materials composed of metal nodes and organic ligands, is widely used for photocatalytic degradation of pollutants. However, the rapid recombination of photoinduced carriers of MOFs limits its photocatalytic degradation performance. Herein, Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets-based NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-MIL-101(Fe) hybrids with Schottky-heterojunctions were fabricated by in&#8197;situ hydrothermal assembly for improved photocatalytic activity. The photodegradation efficiencies of the NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-MIL-101(Fe)/Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; (N-M/T) hybrids for phenol and chlorophenol were 96.36&#8201;% and 99.83&#8201;% within 60&#8197;minutes, respectively. The N-M/T Schottky-heterojunction duly transferred electrons to the Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets surface via built-in electric fields, effectively suppressing the recombination of photogenerated carriers, thereby improving the photocatalytic performance of NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-MIL-101(Fe). Moreover, the Fe-mixed-valence in the N-M/T led to improvement in the efficiency of the in&#8197;situ generated photo-Fenton reactions, further enhancing the photocatalytic activity with more generated reactive oxygen species (ROS). The study proposes a highly effective removal of phenolic pollutants in wastewater.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Macroscopic Polarization Change of Mononuclear Valence Tautomeric Cobalt Complexes Through the Use of Enantiopure Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The crystallization of a complex having electron transfer properties in a polar space group can induce the polarization switching of a crystal in a specific direction, which is attractive for the development of sensors, memory devices, and capacitors. Unfortunately, the probability of crystallization in a polar space group is usually low.&#160;   Noticing that enantiopure compounds crystallize in Sohncke space groups, this paper reports a strategy for the molecular design of non&#8208;ferroelectric polarization switching crystals   based on the use of intramolecular electron transfer and chirality. In addition, this paper describes the synthesis of a mononuclear valence tautomeric (VT) cobalt complex bearing an enantiopure ligand. The introduction of enantiomer enables the crystallization of the complex in the polar space group (P2  1  ).&#160;  The polarization of the crystals along the b&#8208;axis direction is not canceled out and the VT transition is accompanied by a change in the macroscopic polarization of the polar crystal. Polarization switching via electron transfer is realized at around room temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>The Dowd&#8208;Beckwith Reaction: History, Strategies, and Synthetic Potential</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ring&#8208;expansion strategies are valuable synthetic tools that take benefit of existing ring structures and evade the unfavorable enthalpic&#8208;and entropic effects that arise with end&#8208;to&#8208;end cyclizations. One potentially important class of such reactions is the Dowd&#8208;Beckwith reaction, the ring&#8208;expansion of ketones via alkoxy radicals. The exciting advancement in this research area is starting to show its potential, as demonstrated by applying this methodology in strategy&#8208;level bond formation to synthesize complex natural products. This review aims to provide the first comprehensive survey of the development of the Dowd&#8208;Beckwith reaction spanning three decades from the initial report to the present day, thus providing the readers with great detail about the contributions of this reaction to organic synthesis. We hope that this review will further disclose the salient features of the Dowd&#8208;Beckwith reaction for synthetic applications and encourage the development of new, more advanced applications.</dc:description>

         <title>The alkynylative difunctionalization of alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given alkynyl group is an important functional unit, a variety of efficient methods have been developed to construct alkynyl&#8208;containing compounds. Among them, the alkynylative difunctionalization of alkenes is one of the most straightforward and efficient strategies for preparing these compounds and so has made great progress in recent years, including the catalytic asymmetric manner. However, there is no comprehensive review to summarize these studies. This review is aimed at comprehensively summarizing the alkynylative difunctionalization of alkenes, which is presented in terms of alkynylation&#8208;initiated and alkynylation&#8208;terminated difunctionalization of alkenes. We hope that this review will help to encourage more researchers to further explore in this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Thioxanthylium Cations: Highly Reversible Hydrochromic Materials with Tunable Color and Moisture Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrochromic materials, which change color in response to moisture, are highly sought&#8208;after due to some unique applications such as moisture detection, humidity monitoring, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and sweat&#8208;pore mapping. We herein report a new thioxanthene&#8208;9&#8208;ols/thioxanthylium cations hydrochromic system. The hydrochromic thioxanthylium cations can be generated/regenerated by exposing a chemically stable thioxanthene&#8208;9&#8208;ol to trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The intensely colored thioxanthylium cations can be chemically reverted to the colorless thioxanthene&#8208;9&#8208;ol. Interestingly, the conversion between thioxanthene&#8208;9&#8208;ol and its cation species was found to be highly reversible in most cases (up to 50 activation&#8208;deactivation cycles). The color and moisture&#8208;sensitivity of thioxanthylium cations were also validated to be tunable via functionalization of the thioxanthene core with different aliphatic and aromatic groups at its 9 or 2,7&#8208;positions. Finally, paper probes were prepared using solution&#8208;immersion and inkjet&#8208;printing techniques to demonstrate the system&#8217;s potential applications in humidity sensing and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.</dc:description>
