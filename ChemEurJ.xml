         <title>Molecular Mechanism of Substrate Oxidation in Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygenases: Insight from Theoretical Investigations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMO) are copper dependent enzymes that boost the breakdown of cellulose and other recalcitrant polysaccharides through a catalytic, oxidative reaction. However, the exact mechanism and the true nature of the co&#8208;substrate remain controversial. Herein theoretical investigations of the mechanism with substrate are reviewed and advantages and disadvantages of the employed methods are discussed.







Abstract
Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are copper enzymes that today comprise a large enzyme superfamily, grouped into the distinct members AA9&#8211;AA17 (with AA12 exempted). The LPMOs have the potential to facilitate the upcycling of biomass waste products by boosting the breakdown of cellulose and other recalcitrant polysaccharides. The cellulose biopolymer is the main component of biomass waste and thus comprises a large, unexploited resource. The LPMOs work through a catalytic, oxidative reaction whose mechanism is still controversial. For instance, the nature of the intermediate performing the oxidative reaction is an open question, and the same holds for the employed co&#8208;substrate. Here we review theoretical investigations addressing these questions. The applied theoretical methods are usually based on quantum mechanics (QM), often combined with molecular mechanics (QM/MM). We discuss advantages and disadvantages of the employed theoretical methods and comment on the interplay between theoretical and experimental results.

         <title>Propeller, Linear, Cruciform and Stellate Spiro&#8208;bicarbazolium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A common synthetic intermediate approach has enabled the development of two new series of arylbicarbazolium salts, and the formal synthesis of several other classes simplified. These derivatives are recognized as cognates of the neutral spirobifluorene and anionic borate systems, defining a complementary set of ionic/neutral building blocks for chiral reagents, porous materials, and optoelectrically active polymers.







Abstract
A general synthetic approach to halogenated tetraaryl&#8208;ammonium salts has been developed and illustrated crystallographically. Bromide ammonium salts used as common synthetic intermediates together with Suzuki coupling of these bromides to a family of boronic acids provided a simplified strategy for arylation. Resolution of the C2 subset of spiro&#8208;bicarbazolium derivatives led to the first examples of enantiopure spiro&#8208;bicarbazoliums and the assignment of their absolute configuration by comparison of computational and experimental electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra. An ECD comparison with Prelog's spirobifluorenes is provided. The absolute configuration of the meta&#8208;bromide spiro&#8208;bicarbazolium salt was confirmed by anomalous scattering. Cruciform and stellate tetra&#8208;substituted salts provide a test of the limits of the methodology, and their structures suggest them to be candidates for MOF building blocks.

         <title>Red Shift in Optical Excitations on Layered Copper Perovskites under Pressure: Role of the Orthorhombic Instability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By first principles calculations, the behaviour under pressure of the structure and optical transitions of (C2H5NH3)CdCl4:Cu2+ layered system versus two Jahn&#8208;Teller (JT) systems, CdCl2:Cu2+ and NaCl:Cu2+ is explored. The last two systems come from a parent phase where CuCl64&#8722; complexes have orbital degeneracy and thus suffer a JT instability. In contrast, there is no degeneracy in the parent phase of the layered system, which undergoes an orthorhombic instability connected with the red shift under pressure.







Abstract
The red shift under pressure in optical transitions of layered compounds with CuCl64&#8722; units is explored through first&#8208;principles calculations and the analysis of available experimental data. The results on Cu2+&#8208;doped (C2H5NH3)2CdCl4, that is taken as a guide, show the existence of a highly anisotropic response to pressure related to a structural instability, driven by a negative force constant, that leads to an orthorhombic geometry of CuCl64&#8722; units but with a hole displaying a dominant 3z2&#8208;r2 character (z being the direction perpendicular to the layer plane). As a result of such an instability, a pressure of only 3&#8197;GPa reduces by 0.21&#8197;&#197; the longest Cu2+&#8208;Cl&#8722; distance, lying in the layer plane, while leaving unmodified the two other metal&#8208;ligand distances. Owing to this fact, it is shown that the lowest d&#8208;d transition would experience a red shift of 0.34&#8197;eV while the first allowed charge transfer transition is also found to be red shifted but only by 0.11&#8197;eV that reasonably concurs with the experimental value. The parallel study on Jahn&#8208;Teller systems CdCl2:Cu2+ and NaCl:Cu2+ involving tetragonal elongated CuCl64&#8722; units shows that the reduction of the long axis by a pressure of 3&#8197;GPa is three times smaller than that for the layered (C2H5NH3)2CdCl4:Cu2+ compound. Accordingly, the optical transitions of such systems, which involve a positive force constant, are much less sensitive to pressure than in layered compounds. The origin of the red shift under pressure undergone by the lowest d&#8208;d and charge transfer transitions of (C2H5NH3)2CdCl4:Cu2+ is discussed in detail.

         <title>Effective Formation of New C(sp2)&#8722;S Bonds via Photoactivation of Alkylamine&#8208;based Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective approach for the direct thiolation of five&#8208;membered heteroarenes involving visible&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing EDA complexes is reported. The reaction takes place from an EDA complex between an alkylamine and the heteroarene halide. Selective photolysis to the EDA complex has allowed to generate the heteroarene radical that is suitably trapped by disulfide derivatives, providing a potent synthetic versatility.







Abstract
A novel visible light promoted formation of CAryl&#8208;S bonds through electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes of alkylamines with 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered (hetero)arene halides is presented. This represents the first EDA&#8208;based thiolation method not relying on &#960;&#8208;&#960; or a thiolate&#8208;anion&#8208;&#960; interactions and provides a facile access to heteroarene radicals, which can be suitably trapped by disulfide derivatives to form the corresponding versatile arylsulfides. Mechanistic investigations on the aspects of the whole process were conducted by spectroscopic measurements, demonstrating the hypothesized EDA complex formation. Moreover, the strength of this method has been proven by a gram&#8208;scale synthesis of thiolated products and the late&#8208;stage derivatization of an anticoagulant drug.

         <title>A Plausible Prebiotic Path to Nucleosides: Ribosides and Related Aldosides Generated from Ribulose, Fructose, and Similar Abiotic Precursors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple sugars like glyceraldehyde readily form ketoses in plausible prebiotic reactions. These ketoses isomerize to form aldoses. It is shown here that fructose, a ketose, spontaneously isomerizes and forms ribosides with barbituric acid, a noncanonical nucleobase. Also, a one&#8208;pot reaction is demonstrated whereby glyceraldehyde and barbituric acid form glucosides via fructose.A Plausible Prebiotic Path to Nucleosides: Ribosides and Related Aldosides Generated from Ribulose, Fructose, and Similar Abiotic Precursors (Hud et&#8197;al.)







Abstract
The prebiotic origins of ribose, nucleosides, and eventually RNA are enduring questions whose answers are central to the RNA world hypothesis. The abiotic synthesis of sugars was first demonstrated over a century ago, but no known prebiotic reaction produces ribose (an aldose sugar) selectively and in good yield. In contrast, ribulose, and fructose (ketose sugars) and other monosaccharides are formed in high yield by several robust abiotic reactions. It is reported here that ketose sugars &#8208; both ketopentoses and ketohexoes &#8208; serve as precursors for the formation of ribosides and other aldosides, as demonstrated by glycoside&#8208;forming reactions involving barbituric acid, a plausibly prebiotic nucleobase. Moreover, a one&#8208;pot reaction of glyceraldehyde and barbituric acid was discovered which under mild conditions, and without special minerals or other catalysts, results in the formation of glycosides. These results reveal that an exclusive or high&#8208;yielding generation of free ribose was not required for its incorporation into processes that provided the foundations for life.

         <title>In situ Self&#8208;Catalyzed Growth of Manganese&#8208;Embedded 3D Flakes&#8208;Coated Carbon Rod as an Efficient Oxygen&#8208;Reduction Reaction Catalyst of Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>

Coated flakes: Mn&#8208;coordinated N&#8208;aligned 3D graphene&#8208;like flakes&#8208;coated carbon rods are self&#8208;grown catalyzed by Mn. The obtained catalysts exhibit high oxygen&#8208;reduction reaction electrocatalytic performance in alkaline media.







Abstract
The in situ self&#8208;catalyzed growth of manganese&#8208;embedded 3D flakes&#8208;coated carbon rods (GFC) as an efficient oxygen&#8208;reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst of Zinc&#8208;air batteries is described for the first time. By optimizing the amount of Mn in the precursor, a series of 3D graphene&#8208;like flakes&#8208;coated carbon rods were synthesized. GFC with a doping amount of Mn of 10&#8201;% (GFC&#8208;10) exhibits excellent ORR performance with an onset potential of 0.94&#8197;V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode). The Zinc&#8208;air battery is constructed with GFC&#8208;10 as the cathode catalyst, and it exhibits a peak power density of 128.9&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a cycling stability of 75&#8197;h at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which are superior to the commercial 20&#8197;wt% Pt/C&#8208;based Zinc&#8208;air battery. Interestingly, the introduction of Mn facilitates the self&#8208;catalyzed growth of carbon rods, and the change of Mn amount can effectively regulate the morphology of materials. The improved ORR performance of the catalyst is ascribed to the synergistic effect of unique hierarchical porous structure, high&#8208;charge transport capacity, abundant carbon defects/edges and Mn&#8208;Nx sites. This research provides a new avenue to fabricating highly active Mn&#8208;based electrocatalysts for renewable energy systems.

         <title>Tuning the Mechanism of H/D Exchange for Isobutane on H&#8208;BEA by Loading Zn Species in Zeolite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Loading of zinc species in the form of either cations or oxide clusters into zeolite H&#8208;BEA provide the tuning effect on the H/D hydrogen exchange between deuterated isobutane&#8208;d10 and Br&#248;nsted acid sites of the zeolite resulting in the change of the indirect reaction mechanism via olefin intermediate to the mechanism of the direct exchange with the assistance of Zn species.







Abstract
Kinetics of H/D hydrogen exchange between deuterated isobutane&#8208;d10 and Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS) of three zeolite samples (H&#8208;BEA, ZnO/H&#8208;BEA, Zn2+/H&#8208;BEA) were monitored with 1H MAS NMR in&#8197;situ at 343&#8211;468&#8197;K. The regioselective H/D exchange in the methyl groups detected on H&#8208;BEA can be rationalized in terms of the mechanism of indirect exchange, which involves protonation of the intermediate olefin and further hydride abstraction from the other alkane molecule by the formed carbenium ion. Loading of Zn species in the zeolite results in a decrease of the rate and an increase of the activation energy of the exchange. The loaded Zn species provide the tuning effect on the reaction occurrence, changing the mechanism from the indirect one to the mechanism of the direct exchange.

         <title>Synthesis of an Antimicrobial Enterobactin&#8208;Muraymycin Conjugate for Improved Activity Against Gram&#8208;Negative Bacteria</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a thiol&#8208;containing muraymycin analogue and its use in an antimicrobial muraymycin&#8208;enterobactin conjugate with an intracellularly cleavable disulfide linker is reported. This conjugation approach was shown to increase antimicrobial activity against an efflux&#8208;deficient E. coli strain.







Abstract
Overcoming increasing antibiotic resistance requires the development of novel antibacterial agents that address new targets in bacterial cells. Naturally occurring nucleoside antibiotics (such as muraymycins) inhibit the bacterial membrane protein MraY, a clinically unexploited essential enzyme in peptidoglycan (cell wall) biosynthesis. Even though a range of synthetic muraymycin analogues has already been reported, they generally suffer from limited cellular uptake and a lack of activity against Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. We herein report an approach to overcome these hurdles: a synthetic muraymycin analogue has been conjugated to a siderophore, i.&#8201;e. the enterobactin derivative EntKL, to increase the cellular uptake into Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. The resultant conjugate showed significantly improved antibacterial activity against an efflux&#8208;deficient E. coli strain, thus providing a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of this novel approach and a starting point for the future optimisation of such conjugates towards potent agents against Gram&#8208;negative pathogens.

The synthesis and late&#8208;stage diversification of BN&#8208;embedded dibenzocorannulenes (B2N2&#8208;DBCs) based on one&#8208;shot halogenative borylation and successive cross&#8208;coupling reaction is reported. An organic light&#8208;emitting diode employing one of the derivatives as an emitter exhibited a high external quantum efficiency of 6.6&#8201;% and long operational lifetime of 907&#8197;h at an initial luminance of 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and late&#8208;stage diversification of a new class of hetero&#8208;buckybowl, BN&#8208;embedded dibenzocorannulenes (B2N2&#8208;DBCs). The synthesis is achieved via one&#8208;shot halogenative borylation, comprising the nitrogen&#8208;directed haloboration of alkyne and an intramolecular bora&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction, which provides BN&#8208;embedded dibenzocorannulene possessing two bromo substituents (B2N2&#8208;DBC&#8208;Br). B2N2&#8208;DBC&#8208;Br undergoes diversification via coupling reactions to provide a variety of arylated derivatives (B2N2&#8208;DBC&#8208;R), exhibiting strong blue fluorescence. An organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) employing one of the derivatives as an emitter exhibited a high external quantum efficiency of 6.6&#8201;% and long operational lifetime of 907&#8197;h at an initial luminance of 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, indicating the significant potential for the development of efficient and stable hetero&#8208;buckybowl&#8208;based OLED materials.

The synthesis is achieved via one-shot halogenative borylation, comprising the nitrogen-directed haloboration of alkyne and an intramolecular bora-Friedel-Crafts reaction, which provides BN-embedded dibenzocorannulene possessing two bromo substituents (&lt;b&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-DBC-Br&lt;/b&gt;). &lt;b&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-DBC-Br&lt;/b&gt; undergoes diversification via coupling reactions to provide a variety of arylated derivatives (&lt;b&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-DBC-R&lt;/b&gt;), exhibiting strong blue fluorescence. An organic light-emitting diode (OLED) employing one of the derivatives as an emitter exhibited a high external quantum efficiency of 6.6&#8201;% and long operational lifetime of 907&#8197;h at an initial luminance of 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, indicating the significant potential for the development of efficient and stable hetero-buckybowl-based OLED materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of 1&#8208;Aminoisoquinolines and Their Application in a Host&#8208;Guest Doped Strategy To Construct Ultralong Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Materials for Bioimaging</title>

         <dc:description>
A convenient, efficient and direct approach toward structurally diverse substituted 1&#8208;aminoisoquinoline derivatives has been developed. By simply doping the 1&#8208;aminoisoquinolines into benzophenone (BP), a series of RTP systems with tunable lifetime luminescence can be realized. 4&#8201;r/BP nanoparticles could be used for in&#8208;vivo imaging with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio.







Abstract
Organic ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have attracted great attention for their wide applications in optoelectronic devices and bioimaging. However, the development of these materials remains a challenging task, partially due to the lack of rational molecular design strategies and unclear luminescence mechanisms. Herein, we present a method for facile access to structurally diverse substituted 1&#8208;aminoisoquinoline derivatives through a copper&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component coupling reaction that provides a promising approach to rapidly assemble a library of 1&#8208;aminoisoquinolines for exploring the regularity of the host&#8208;guest doped system. A series of host&#8208;guest RTP materials with wide&#8208;ranging lifetimes from 4.4 to 299.3&#8197;ms were constructed by doping various substituted isoquinolines derivatives into benzophenone (BP). Furthermore, 4&#8201;r/BP nanoparticles could be used for in&#8208;vivo imaging with a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio value as high as 32, revealing the potential of the isoquinoline framework for the construction of high&#8208;performance RTP materials.

         <title>Confused&#8208;Prism[5]arene: a Conformationally Adaptive Host by Stereoselective Opening of the 1,4&#8208;Bridged Naphthalene Flap</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
All change, all together: The confused&#8208;prism[5]arene host changes its planar chirality upon the complexation of ammonium guests, adopting the homochiral all&#8208;pR (or all&#8208;pS) conformation. Stereoselective directional threading was also observed in the presence of directional ammonium axles, resulting in the formation of pseudorotaxanes in which the prismarene wheel adopts homochiral all&#8208;pR (all&#8208;pS) conformation.







Abstract
The confused&#8208;prism[5]arene macrocycle (c&#8208;PrS[5]Me) shows conformational adaptive behavior in the presence of ammonium guests. Upon guest inclusion, the 1,4&#8208;bridged naphthalene flap reverses its planar chirality from pS to pR (with reference to the pS(pR)4 enantiomer). Stereoselective directional threading is also observed in the presence of directional axles, in which up/down stereoisomers of homochiral (pR)5&#8208;c&#8208;PrS[5]Me pseudorotaxanes are formed.

         <title>Electrostatic CH&#8722;&#960; Interactions Can Override Fluorine Gauche Effects To Exert Conformational Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Are the fluorine gauche effects in fluoroethyl systems controlled electrostatically or by hyperconjugation? This experimental study shows that electrostatic forces from CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions (between polar CH2F protons and an adjacent aromatic ring) can override an inherent fluorine gauche effect to exert conformational control over fluoroethyl systems.







Abstract
Fluorine gauche effects are conformational properties of 2&#8208;fluoroethanes often applied in modern molecular designs. However, the physical origins of fluorine gauche effects are not well understood, with the consensus favoring the established hyperconjugation theory over an emerging electrostatic model. Using a series of model systems, we show that a shift to fluorine gauche effects can be influenced by intramolecular CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; aromatic interactions, a through&#8208;space event. Modulating the &#960;&#8208;ring (forming the aromatic interaction) with substituent groups resulted in a linear Hammett relationship, thus indicating that the CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction has electrostatic features. For instance, attaching a nitro group (an electron&#8208;withdrawing substituent) to the &#960;&#8208;ring weakened the CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction and led to a gauche preference, whereas an anti conformer is preferred with amine as substituent. The experimental results performed by using proton NMR spectroscopy are corroborated by gas&#8208;phase DFT calculations and solid&#8208;state X&#8208;ray crystallography.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Driven Programmable Chiral Self&#8208;Sorting in Metal&#8208;Organic Cages and Structural Transformations between Heterochiral and Homochiral Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented tunable selectivity in chiral self&#8208;sorting is achieved in the formation of Pd2L4 cages. Anions encapsulation dictates the outcome of diastereomer selectivity, either meso&#8208;cage or racemic mixture of homochiral cages, through chiral social or narcissistic self&#8208;sorting, respectively. Bulky non&#8208;encapsulating anion resulted in no selective chiral self&#8208;sorting. Post&#8208;synthetic anion&#8208;exchange facilitates interconversion between the diastereomers in a desired manner.







Abstract
When a racemic mixture of chiral building blocks self&#8208;assembles to form discrete molecular or supramolecular cages, the system can adopt either social or narcissistic chiral self&#8208;sorting. However, control over such chiral self&#8208;sorting is hard to achieve with a desired choice of outcome. Herein, we report anion templated high&#8208;fidelity chiral self&#8208;sorting during the coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of [Pd2L4] metal&#8208;organic cages, with a racemic mixture of an axially chiral ligand. Upon varying the counter&#8208;anions, the outcome of the choice of chiral self&#8208;sorting, whether social or narcissistic, leading to kinetically favored heterochiral or thermodynamically favored homochiral cages, can be controlled through specific anion encapsulation. Non&#8208;encapsulating anion afforded a mixture of all possible diastereomers. Anion exchange enabled structural transformations between the diastereomers and the conversion of the mixture of diastereomers into homochiral diastereomers.

Towards the red&#8208;light area. A reliable synthesis of a new tetra(peri&#8208;naphthylene)anthracene derivative decorated with triisopropylsilylethynyl moieties has been established. The soluble compound features strongly bathochromically shifted absorption and emission bands reaching into the near&#8208;IR region and is prone to four facilitated redox steps. The experimental results, corroborated by theoretical studies, identified the &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycyclic scaffold as a particularly promising candidate for the development of redox&#8208;active near&#8208;IR fluorophores.







Abstract
A novel, benign synthetic strategy towards soluble tetra(peri&#8208;naphthylene)anthracene (TPNA) decorated with triisopropylsilylethynyl substituents has been established. The compound is perfectly stable under ambient conditions in air and features intense and strongly bathochromically shifted UV/vis absorption and emission bands reaching to near&#8208;IR region beyond 900&#8197;nm. Cyclic voltammetry measurements revealed four facilitated reversible redox events comprising two oxidations and two reductions. These remarkable experimental findings were corroborated by theoretical studies to identify the TPNA platform a particularly useful candidate for the development of functional near&#8208;IR fluorophores upon appropriate functionalization.

         <title>Recent Status and Developments of Vacancies Modulation in the ABO3 Perovskites for Catalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modification of ABO3 with different sites vacancies could optimize its physical&#8211;chemical properties, thereby enhancing its performance at catalytic redox reactions, energy storage, gas sensor, photovoltaics, etc, which exhibiting the potential of the commercial applications.







Abstract
Perovskite oxides (ABO3) have attracted comprehensive interest for wide range of functional applications (especially for chemical catalysis) due to their high design flexibility, controllable vacancies sites creation, abundant chemical properties, and stable crystal structure. Herein, the previous research and potential development of ABO3 through adjusting the vacancy at different sites (A&#8208;site, B&#8208;site, and O&#8208;site) to enhance catalytic performance are systematically analyzed and generalized. Briefly, the ABO3 with different vacancies sites prepared by multifarious direct and indirect methods, accompanied with the improved physical&#8208;chemical properties, endow them with distinct and intensified development of catalysis application. In addition, the impressive optimization proved by the vacancies sites adjustment over the ABO3 is studied to continuously facilitate the advance in some common catalysis reactions, further expanding to other optimized functional applications. At last, the constructive suggestions for fine regulation and analysis of vacancies sites over ABO3 are also put forward.

         <title>Hijacking the Peptidoglycan Recycling Pathway of Escherichia coli to Produce Muropeptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward access to Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive muropeptides was developed by a chemo&#8208;enzymatic strategy based on metabolically engineered E.coli cells.







Abstract
Soluble fragments of peptidoglycan called muropeptides are released from the cell wall of bacteria as part of their metabolism or as a result of biological stresses. These compounds trigger immune responses in mammals and plants. In bacteria, they play a major role in the induction of antibiotic resistance. The development of efficient methods to produce muropeptides is, therefore, desirable both to address their mechanism of action and to design new antibacterial and immunostimulant agents. Herein, we engineered the peptidoglycan recycling pathway of Escherichia coli to produce N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;glucosaminyl&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;1,6&#8208;anhydro&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;muramic acid (GlcNAc&#8208;anhMurNAc), a common precursor of Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive muropeptides. Inactivation of the hexosaminidase nagZ gene allowed the efficient production of this key disaccharide, providing access to Gram&#8208;positive muropeptides through subsequent chemical peptide conjugation. E. coli strains deficient in both NagZ hexosaminidase and amidase activities further enabled the in&#8197;vivo production of Gram&#8208;negative muropeptides containing meso&#8208;diaminopimelic acid, a rarely available amino acid.

         <title>Selective Metal&#8208;ion Complexation of a Biomimetic Calix[6]arene Funnel Cavity Functionalized with Phenol or Quinone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The calixarene core allows the introduction of functional groups at remote distance from the metal ion, but in the vicinity of its labile site. Introducing a phenol or quinone moiety in the calix core, in place of anisole, drastically changes not only thermodynamics but also kinetics of metal ion and guest&#8208;ligand binding, while the first coordination sphere is not affected.







Abstract
In the biomimetic context, many studies have evidenced the importance of the 1st and 2nd coordination sphere of a metal ion for controlling its properties. Here, we propose to evaluate a yet poorly explored aspect, which is the nature of the cavity that surrounds the metal labile site. Three calix[6]arene&#8208;based aza&#8208;ligands are compared, that differ only by the nature of cavity walls, anisole, phenol or quinone (LOMe, LOH and LQ). Monitoring ligand exchange of their ZnII complexes evidenced important differences in the metal ion relative affinities for nitriles, halides or carboxylates. It also showed a possible sharp kinetic control on both, metal ion binding and ligand exchange. Hence, this study supports the observations reported on biological systems, highlighting that the substitution of an amino&#8208;acid residue of the enzyme active site, at remote distance of the metal ion, can have strong impacts on metal ion lability, substrate/product exchange or selectivity.

         <title>Heavy Chains: Synthesis, Reactivity and Decomposition of Interpnictogen Chains with Terminal Diaryl Bismuth Fragments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chains made of bismuth and other group 15 elements were prepared and investigated with respect to their reactivity. Three&#8208; and four&#8208;membered chains of different compositions were obtained. It is shown that, for example, the Bi&#8722;P&#8722;Bi chain can be cleaved with a carbene. In this reaction, the middle chain link is transferred as a phosphinide to the carbene. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Dunaj and C. von&#8197;H&#228;nisch (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202932).

         <title>Butterfly&#8208;Shaped Nanographenes with Excellent Second&#8208;Order Nonlinear Optical Properties: The Synergy of B/N and Azulene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergy between electron&#8208;deficient B, electron&#8208;rich N, and polar azulene with a proper arrangement endows these butterfly&#8208;shaped nanographenes with strong second&#8208;order NLO responses.







Abstract
Azulene, a simple polar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with connected electron donor and acceptor (DA), ignites the hope of designing second&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) molecular materials from pure nonpolar carbon nanomaterials. In this work, a butterfly&#8208;shaped nanographene (&#960;&#8722;DA&#8722;&#960;) was designed by incorporating azulene between two coronenes. One more electron in a N atom or one electron fewer in a B atom with respect to a C atom can polarize charge distribution in carbon nanomaterials, and further doping of B and N in the designed butterfly&#8208;shaped nanographene changes the system from &#960;&#8722;DA&#8722;&#960; to D&#8722;&#960;&#8722;A, leading to strong NLO responses. For example, the largest static first hyperpolarizability even reaches 173.89&#215;10&#8722;30&#8197;esu per heavy atom. The synergetic role of B, N and azulene in the nanographene is scrutinized, and such a doping strategy is found to provide an effective means for the design of carbon&#8208;based functional materials. The strong second&#8208;order NLO responses of these butterfly&#8208;shaped carbon&#8208;based nanographenes under external fields, for example, sum frequency generation and difference frequency generation, could inspire future experimental exploration.

     alt="Butterfly-Shaped Nanographenes with Excellent Second-Order Nonlinear Optical Properties: The Synergy of B/N and Azulene"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The synergy between&lt;/b&gt; electron-deficient B, electron-rich N, and polar azulene with a proper arrangement endows these butterfly-shaped nanographenes with strong second-order NLO responses.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azulene, a simple polar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with connected electron donor and acceptor (DA), ignites the hope of designing second-order nonlinear optical (NLO) molecular materials from pure nonpolar carbon nanomaterials. In this work, a butterfly-shaped nanographene (&#960;&#8722;DA&#8722;&#960;) was designed by incorporating azulene between two coronenes. One more electron in a N atom or one electron fewer in a B atom with respect to a C atom can polarize charge distribution in carbon nanomaterials, and further doping of B and N in the designed butterfly-shaped nanographene changes the system from &#960;&#8722;DA&#8722;&#960; to D&#8722;&#960;&#8722;A, leading to strong NLO responses. For example, the largest static first hyperpolarizability even reaches 173.89&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;30&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;esu per heavy atom. The synergetic role of B, N and azulene in the nanographene is scrutinized, and such a doping strategy is found to provide an effective means for the design of carbon-based functional materials. The strong second-order NLO responses of these butterfly-shaped carbon-based nanographenes under external fields, for example, sum frequency generation and difference frequency generation, could inspire future experimental exploration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bimetallic CuSbSe2: A Potential Anode Material for Sodium and Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries with High&#8208;Rate Capability and Long&#8208;Term Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimetallic CuSbSe2 are successfully synthesis and evaluated in sodium&#8208; and lithium&#8208; ion batteries. The CuSbSe2 anode exhibits superior rate behavior and cyclic performance. The excellent electrochemical property is attributed to the synergistic effect and the high electric conductivity of the material.







Abstract
Bimetallic transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) materials have emerged as attractive anodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) because of the high intrinsic electronic conductivity, rich redox sites and unique reaction mechanism. In this work, we report the synthesis and electrochemical properties of a novel bimetallic TMCs material CuSbSe2. The as&#8208;prepared anode delivers a high reversible capacity of 545.6&#8197;&#8201;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 for SIBs and 592.6&#8197;&#8201;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 for LIBs at a current density of 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and an excellent rate capability of 425.9&#8197;&#8201;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 for SIBs and 226.0&#8197;&#8201;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 for LIBs without any common&#8208;used surface modification or carbonaceous compositing. In addition, ex situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and High&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) reveal a combined conversion&#8208;alloying reaction mechanism of LIBs and NIBs. Our findings suggest bimetallic CuSbSe2 could be a potential anode material for both SIBs and LIBs.

         <title>Triple Thorpe&#8208;Ingold Effect in the Synthesis of 18&#8208;Membered C3 Symmetric Lactams Stacking as Endless Supramolecular Tubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three C 3 symmetric macrolactams were very efficiently cyclized from their linear precursors. Adequately located substituents are responsible for the enhancement of reactivity that is not observed in the unsubstituted parent. DFT calculations show that the properly folded cyclization precursor, the reactive conformer, is more populated than other conformers, leading to a decrease of free energy of activation. The crystal structure of the ring substituted with three very bulky esters indicates that tubular stacking is preserved.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Bioreducible polymeric mRNA carriers are an emerging family of vectors for gene delivery and vaccine development. Several bioreducible systems have been generated through aqueous&#8208;phase ring&#8208;opening polymerization of lipoic acid derivatives, however this methodology limits the incorporation of hydrophobic functionalities into resulting polymers. Herein we synthesize a poly(active ester)disulfide polymer that can undergo facile aminolysis with amine&#8208;containing substrates under stoichiometric control and&#160; mild reaction conditions to yield a library of multifunctional polydisulfide polymers. Functionalized polydisulfide polymer species form stable mRNA&#8208;polymer nanoparticles for intracellular delivery of mRNAs in vitro . Alkyl&#8208;functionalized polydisulfide&#8208;RNA nanoparticles demonstrate rapid cellular uptake and excellent biodegradability when delivering EGFP and OVA mRNAs to cells in vitro .

Here, we report the synthesis and application of four new supramolecular tweezer&#8208;based oxidation catalysts.

All catalysts display preferential oxidation of the strongly deactivated C3/C4 positions, however to different degrees. Furthermore, the best performing catalyst Fe(pdp)Twe was explored with an expanded substrate scope. It was demonstrated that the deactivated positions C3/C4 are also preferentially oxidized in these cases.</dc:description>

         <title>Bifunctional Ru clusters decorated Co3B&#8208;Co(OH)2 hybrid catalyst synergistically promotes NaBH4 hydrolysis and water splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing a highly efficient bifunctional catalyst for hydrolysis of metal hydrides and spontaneous hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is essential for substituting conventional fuels for H2 production. Herein, a sheet&#8208;like Ru clusters modified Co3B&#8208;Co(OH)2 supported on nickel foam (Ru/Co3B&#8208;Co(OH)2@NF) is constructed by electroless deposition, calcination and chemical reduction. The catalyst exhibits an excellent H2 generation activity with a rate of 4989 mL min&#8722;1 [[EQUATION]]  and good reusability, superior to most previously reported catalysts. Besides, Ru/Co3B&#8208;Co(OH)2@NF displays a prominent hydrogen evolution reaction catalytic capability with a low overpotential of 153.0 mV at 100 mA cm&#8722;2 (50.5 mV at 10mA cm&#8722;2), a small Tafel slope of 40.0 mV dec&#8722;1 and long&#8208;term stability (100 h@10 mA cm&#8722;2) in 1.0 M KOH. The excellent catalytic H2 generation capacity benefits from the rapid charge transfer promoted by metallic Co3B, the synergistically catalytic effect between Co3B&#8208;Co(OH)2 and Ru clusters, and the unique composite structure favorable for solute transport and gas emission.</dc:description>

         <title>Detection of the Dark States in Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) Process of Electron Donor&#8722;Acceptor Dyads: Insights from Optical Transient Absorption Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photophysical processes involved in the electron donor&#8722;acceptor thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) of emitters are complicated and controversial. The recent consensus is that at least three states are involved, i.e. the singlet charge transfer state (1CT), the triplet localized excited state (3LE) and the triplet CT state (3CT). It is clear the very often used steady state and time&#8208;resolved luminescence spectroscopic methods are unable to present direct evidence for the dark states, i.e. the 3LE and 3CT states, as well as the interconversion of these states. Concerning this aspect, the femtosecond&#8208;nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopic methods are in particular interests.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The photophysical processes involved in the electron donor&#8722;acceptor thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) of emitters are complicated and controversial. The recent consensus is that at least three states are involved, i.e. the singlet charge transfer state (1CT), the triplet localized excited state (3LE) and the triplet CT state (3CT). It is clear the very often used steady state and time-resolved luminescence spectroscopic methods are unable to present direct evidence for the dark states, i.e. the 3LE and 3CT states, as well as the interconversion of these states. Concerning this aspect, the femtosecond-nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopic methods are in particular interests. Both the emissive state and the dark state can be detected in these spectra, and interconversion of the states involved in TADF process can be also revealed. This review article focuses on the recent development of using the transient absorption spectra to study the photophysics of the TADF emitters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Maytansinol Functionalization: Towards Useful Probes for Studying Microtubule Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Maytansinoids represent a successful class of natural and semisynthetic tubulin binders, known for their potent cytotoxic activity. Their wider application as cytotoxins and chemical probes to study tubulin dynamics was set back due to the complexity of natural product chemistry. Here we report the synthesis of long&#8208;chain derivatives and maytansinoid conjugates. We confirmed that bulky substituents do not impact their high activity and the scaffold&#8217;s binding mode. These encouraging results open new avenues for the design of new maytansine&#8208;based probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Magnetic Anisotropy and Relaxation of Pseudotetrahedral [N2O2] Bis&#8208;Chelate Cobalt(II) Single&#8208;Ion Magnets Controlled by Dihedral Twist Through Solvomorphism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The methanol solvomorph 1&#183;2MeOH of the cobalt(II) complex [Co(LSal,2&#8208;Ph)2] (1) with the sterically demanding Schiff&#8208;base ligand 2&#8208;(([1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;2&#8208;ylimino)methyl)phenol (HLSal,2&#8208;Ph) shows the thus far largest dihedral twist distortion between the two chelate planes compared to an ideal pseudotetrahedral arrangement. The cobalt(II) ion in 1&#183;2MeOH exhibits an easy&#8208;axis anisotropy leading to a spinreversal barrier of 55.3 cm&#8211;1, which corresponds to an increase of about 17% induced by the larger dihedral twist compared to the solvent&#8208;free complex 1. The magnetic relaxation for 1&#183;2MeOH is significantly slower compared to 1. An in&#8208;depth frequency&#8208;domain Fouriertransform (FD&#8208;FT) THz&#8208;EPR study not only allowed the direct measurement of the magnetic transition between the two lowest Kramers doublets for the cobalt(II) complexes, but also revealed the presence of spin&#8208;phonon coupling. Interestingly, a similar dihedral twist correlation is also observed for a second pair of cobalt(II)&#8208;based solvomorphs, which could be benchmarked by FD&#8208;FT THz&#8208;EPR.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Insights into Bifunctional Ambruticin DH3 for Substrate Specificity and Catalytic Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dehydratase (DH), a domain located at polyketide synthase (PKS) modules, commonly catalyzes the dehydration of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy to an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acyl intermediate. As a unique bifunctional dehydratase, AmbDH3 (the DH domain of module 3 of the ambruticin PKS) is verified to be responsible for both dehydration and the following pyran&#8208;forming cyclization. Besides, in vitro studies showed that its catalytic efficiency varies with different chiral substrates. However, the detailed molecular mechanism of AmbDH3 remains unclear. In this work, the structural rationale for the substrate specificity (2R/2S&#8208; and 6R/6S&#8208;substrates) in AmbDH3 was elucidated and the complete reaction pathways including dehydration and cyclization were presented. Both MD simulations and binding free energy calculations indicated AmbDH3 had a stronger preference for 2R&#8208;substrates (2R6R&#8208;2, 2R6S&#8208;3) than 2S&#8208;substrates (2S6R&#8208;1), and residue H51 and G61 around the catalytic pocket were emphasized by forming stable hydrogen bonds with 2R&#8208;substrates. In addition, AmbDH3&#8217;s mild tolerance at C6 was explained by comparison of substrate conformation and hydrogen bond network in 6S&#8208; and 6R&#8208;substrate systems. The QM/MM results supported a consecutive one&#8208;base dehydration and cyclization mechanism for 2R6S&#8208;3 substrate with the energy barrier of 25.2 kcal mol&#8208;1 and 24.5 kcal mol&#8208;1, respectively. Our computational results uncover the substrate recognition and catalytic process of the first bifunctional dehydratase&#8208;cyclase AmbDH3, which will shed light on the application of multifunctional DH domains in PKSs for diverse natural product analogs and benefit the chemoenzymatic synthesis of stereoselective pyran&#8208;containing products.</dc:description>

         <title>Concurrent Enhancement of Acetylene Uptake Capacity and Selectivity by Progressive Core Expansion and Extra&#8208;Framework Anions in Pore&#8208;Space&#8208;Partitioned Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>

         <dc:description>A multi&#8208;stage core&#8208;expansion method is proposed here as one component of the integrative binding&#8208;site/extender/core&#8208;expansion (BEC) strategy. The conceptual deconstruction of the partitioning ligand into three editable parts draws our focus onto progressive core expansion and allows the optimization of both acetylene uptake and selectivity. The effectiveness of this strategy is shown through a family of eight cationic pore&#8208;partitioned materials containing three different partitioning ligands and various counter anions. The optimized structure, Co3&#8208;cpt&#8208;tph&#8208;Cl (Hcpt = 4&#8208;(p&#8208;carboxyphenyl)&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole, H&#8208;tph = (2,5,8&#8208;tri&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3,4,6,7,9&#8208;hexaazaphenalene) with the largest surface area and highest C2H2 uptake capacity (200 cm3/g at 298 K), also exhibits (desirably) the lowest CO2 uptake and hence the highest C2H2/CO2 selectivity. The successful boost in both C2H2 capacity and IAST selectivity allows Co3&#8208;cpt&#8208;tph&#8208;Cl to rank among the best crystalline porous materials, ionic MOFs in particular, for C2H2 uptake and C2H2/CO2 experimental breakthrough separation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A &#960;&#8208;extended, diaza&#8208;triphenylene embedded, mono&#8208;anionic corrole analogue and its Ni(II)&#8208;complex were synthesized from a diaza&#8208;triphenylene precursor, which was obtained from a double one&#8208;carbon insertion into a naphthobipyrrole diester. Following conversion to the corresponding activated diol and acid&#8208;catalyzed condensation with pyrrole and subsequent reaction with pentafluorobenzaldehyde, afforded mono&#8208;anionic, &#960;&#8208;extended bipyricorrole&#8208;like macrocycle. Attempted Ni(II) insertion with Ni(OAc)2&#8226;4H2O resulted an ESR active, Ni(II) bipyricorrole radical complex, which is converted to stable cationic Ni(II) complex upon treatment with [(Et3O)+(SbCl6)&#8208;]. Both complexes were characterized by 1H&#8208; and 13C&#8208;NMR, UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The Ni(II) bipyricorrole radical complex is converted to cationic Ni(II) complex by single electron reduction using cobaltocene.

         <title>Development of Low&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Organogelators from Cyclic &#946;&#8208;Amino Acid: Effect of Stereochemistry and their Application on Visual Chiral Recognition of Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study reports the formation of low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelators based on carboxylic acids derived from chiral cyclic &#8208;&#946;&#8208;amino acids. The effect of their stereochemistry on the gelation of organic solvents was investigated, and their assemblies with the intermolecular interactions in the xerogels were proposed via infrared spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and crystallographic details of the related model compounds. The effect of the alkyl chain length on the gelators was studied, and they were applied to the chiral recognition of amines. Only one diastereomeric salt with amines afforded gels, whereas the others resulted in precipitates. Chiral recognition was also achieved in the gel state, and the appearance of the as&#8208;prepared gel changed upon the addition of each amine enantiomer, thus enabling the visual detection of their chirality.</dc:description>

         <title>ZnTe/rGO composite as the Fully&#8208;Zinced Conversion&#8208;Type Cathodes for Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conversion&#8208;type cathodes for aqueous zinc ion batteries (ZIBs) can provide flat plateau slop and stable output potential, compared to general intercalation&#8208;type cathodes. The high volumetric capacity and stable output potential of Te make it a promising cathode for ZIBs, but sluggish kinetics and large volume change hinder its further application. To address these issues, we revisit fully&#8208;zinced ZnTe and construct ZnTe/rGO composites as the new conversion&#8208;type cathode. The electrode undergoes a solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid conversion reaction and shows a stable output potential with ultra&#8208;flat discharge plateau slop of 0.09 V (Ah g&#8208;1)&#8208;1. When ZnTe is de&#8208;zinced and transformed to Te during charge process, it has a volume shrinkage which generates empty space in graphene matrix for latter volume expansion of Te. The graphene matrix also improves conductivity and reaction kinetics of the cathode. Due to the combination of pre&#8208;zincation of ZnTe, graphene matrix and the elimination of &#8220;shuttle effects&#8221; process, ZnTe/rGO electrode exhibits a high and stable capacity of 186 mAh g&#8208;1 at 500 mA g&#8208;1 after 300 cycling, with almost no decay after initial 10 cycles.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Isocyanide&#8208;based multicomponent reactions claim a one century&#8208;old history of flourishing developments. On the other hand, the enormous impact of recent progresses in visible light photocatalysis has boosted the identification of new straightforward and green approaches to both new and known chemical entities. In this context, the application of visible light photocatalytic conditions to multicomponent processes has been promoting key stimulating advancements. Spanning from radical&#8208;polar crossover pathways, to photoinduced and self&#8208;catalyzed transformations, to reactions involving the generation of imidoyl radical species, the present literature analysis would provide a general and critical overview about the potentialities and challenges of exploiting isocyanides in visible light photocatalytic multicomponent reactions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Two synthetic approaches have until now been used to synthesize transition metal complexes having a tridentate (pincer or tripod) PEP tetryl (E = Si, Ge, Sn) ligand. These approaches differ in the metal&#8208;free precursor, tetrelane or tetrylene, that gives rise to the corresponding PEP tetryl ligand. Tetrelanes (PSiP silanes, PGeP germanes and PSnP stannanes and simple phosphane&#8208;free stannanes) have led to tetryl ligands by oxidatively adding an E&#8211;X bond (X = H, C or halogen in most cases) to the metal atom of a low&#8208;valent transition metal complex, whereas tetrylenes (PGeP germylenes and PSnP stannylenes) have led to tetryl ligands upon insertion of their E atom into an M&#8211;X bond (X = Cl in most cases) of the metal precursor or through a derivatization of the E atom after the tetrylene fragment is coordinated to the metal. For each synthetic approach, all the currently known types of PEP tetryl ligand frameworks that have been found in transition metal complexes are presented and discussed in this review.</dc:description>

         <title>Structures and Supramolecular Properties of Inclusion Complexes of Anthracene&#8211;Triptycene Nanocages with Fullerene Guests and Their Dynamic Motion as Molecular Gyroscopes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three derivatives of macrocyclic cage compounds consisting of diarylanthracene and triptycene units were synthesized. These nanocages formed host&#8211;guest complexes with C60 and other fullerene guests as confirmed by 1H NMR and fluorescence spectroscopy. The association constant of the mesityl and 2,4,6&#8208;tributoxyphenyl derivatives with C60 was determined to be 2.2 &#215; 104 L mol&#8211;1, which was larger than that of the pentafluorophenyl derivative. We obtained direct experimental evidence of the complexation by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis: the guest C60 molecule was included in the cavity via multipoint CH&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions. Dynamic disorders of the included C60 molecule in variable&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray analysis indicated uniaxial motion, such as gyroscopic motion. The unique dynamic behavior of the spherical C60 rotor anchored by the cage stator via CH&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions in the crystal, as well as substituent effects on the association properties, will be discussed with the aid of DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>POM@ZIF Derived Mixed Metal Oxide Catalysts for Sustained Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of efficient and stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts based on noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free materials is crucial for energy conversion and storage. In this work, we demonstrate how polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;67 can be converted into a stable oxygen evolution electrocatalyst by chemical etching, cation exchange, and thermal annealing steps. Characterization using X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy indicate that POM&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;67 derived carbon supported metal oxides were synthesized. The resulting composite shows structural and compositional advantages which lead to low overpotential (306 mV at j = 10 mA&#183;cm&#8211;2) and long&#8208;term stability under harsh OER conditions (1.0 M aqueous KOH).</dc:description>

         <title>N2&#8208;Reduction vs H2&#8208;Evolution in a Molybdenum&#8208; or Tungsten&#8208;Based Small&#8208;Molecule Model System of Nitrogenase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molybdenum dinitrogen complexes have played a major role as catalytic model systems of nitrogenase. In comparison, analogous tungsten complexes have in most cases found to be catalytically inactive. Herein we show that a tungsten complex supported by a pentadentate tetrapodal (pentaPod) phosphine ligand, under conditions of N  2  fixation, primarily catalyses the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), in contrast to its Mo analogue, which catalytically mediates the nitrogen reduction reaction (N  2  RR). DFT calculations are employed to evaluate possible mechanisms and identify the most likely pathways of N  2  RR and HER activities exhibited by Mo&#8208; and W&#8208;pentaPod complexes. Two mechanisms for N  2  RR by PCET are considered, starting from neutral (M(0) cycle) and cationic (M(I) cycle) dinitrogen complexes (M = Mo, W). The latter is found to be energetically more favourable. For HER three scenarios are treated; i.e., through bimolecular reactions of early M&#8208;N  x  H  y  intermediates, pure hydride intermediates or mixed M(H)(N  x  H  y  ) species.</dc:description>

         <title>A Chemotactic Colloidal Motor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 67, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemotactic colloidal motors can be served as excellent physical models of non&#8208;equilibrium complex systems and also have potential in active target delivery and other biomedical applications. In this Concept, both the recent experimental progress and theoretical opinion of chemotactic motors based on the torque&#8208;driven self&#8208;reorientation and alignment mechanism are discussed.







Abstract
Chemotaxis plays a crucial role in the realization of various functions of human life such as fertilization, immune function, inflammatory response, regeneration processes, etc. Inspired by the natural chemotaxis, colloidal motors with chemotactic ability can realize intelligent sense and targeted navigation, which bring a revolutionary method to biomedical applications like precision medicine. However, the application in the biomedical field requires the colloidal motors with submicrometer scale, strong chemotactic ability and clear chemotactic mechanism. In this Concept article, we introduce the recent progress of chemotactic colloidal motors, covering the fundamental theory behind experimental advancements. Particularly, the torque&#8208;driven reorientation motion of the submicrometer&#8208;sized colloidal motors during chemotaxis is discussed, and also their underlying mechanism is proposed. With the continuous research on chemotactic colloidal motors, it is believed that the emerging chemotactic colloidal motors will broaden practical applications in the biomedical field.

         <title>Enabling Aromatic Hydroxylation in a Cytochrome P450 Monooxygenase Enzyme through Protein Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 67, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural and biochemical data demonstrate that 4&#8208;phenylbenzoic acid binds within the active site of the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CYP199A4, but no oxidation occurs. Protein engineering and molecular dynamic simulations establish that aromatic oxidation is enabled by a subtle shift of the substrate relative to the heme, thus improving our understanding of this important reaction.







Abstract
The cytochrome P450 (CYP) family of heme monooxygenases catalyse the selective oxidation of C&#8722;H bonds under ambient conditions. The CYP199A4 enzyme from Rhodopseudomonas palustris catalyses aliphatic oxidation of 4&#8208;cyclohexylbenzoic acid but not the aromatic oxidation of 4&#8208;phenylbenzoic acid, due to the distinct mechanisms of aliphatic and aromatic oxidation. The aromatic substrates 4&#8208;benzyl&#8208;, 4&#8208;phenoxy&#8208; and 4&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;benzoic acid and methoxy&#8208;substituted phenylbenzoic acids were assessed to see if they could achieve an orientation more amenable to aromatic oxidation. CYP199A4 could catalyse the efficient benzylic oxidation of 4&#8208;benzylbenzoic acid. The methoxy&#8208;substituted phenylbenzoic acids were oxidatively demethylated with low activity. However, no aromatic oxidation was observed with any of these substrates. Crystal structures of CYP199A4 with 4&#8208;(3&#8242;&#8208;methoxyphenyl)benzoic acid demonstrated that the substrate binding mode was like that of 4&#8208;phenylbenzoic acid. 4&#8208;Phenoxy&#8208; and 4&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;benzoic acid bound with the ether or ketone oxygen atom hydrogen&#8208;bonded to the heme aqua ligand. We also investigated whether the substitution of phenylalanine residues in the active site could permit aromatic hydroxylation. Mutagenesis of the F298 residue to a valine did not significantly alter the substrate binding position or enable the aromatic oxidation of 4&#8208;phenylbenzoic acid; however the F182L mutant was able to catalyse 4&#8208;phenylbenzoic acid oxidation generating 2&#8242;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;, 3&#8242;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208; and 4&#8242;&#8208;hydroxy metabolites in a 83&#8201;:&#8201;9&#8201;:&#8201;8 ratio, respectively. Molecular dynamics simulations, in which the distance and angle of attack were considered, demonstrated that in the F182L variant, in contrast to the wild&#8208;type enzyme, the phenyl ring of 4&#8208;phenylbenzoic acid attained a productive geometry for aromatic oxidation to occur.

         <title>Highly Chemoselective Catalytic Photooxidations by Using Solvent as a Sacrificial Electron Acceptor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 67, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
New way to drive photoredox catalysis: Highly chemoselective photooxidations of benzylic alcohols to carbonyl compounds in the presence of various easily&#8208;oxidizable groups are possible in a simple oxygen&#8208;free system consisting of a substrate, unique deazaflavinium catalyst and acetonitrile which acts simultaneously as a sacrificial electron acceptor and solvent.







Abstract
Catalyst recovery is an integral part of photoredox catalysis. It is often solved by adding another component&#8208;a sacrificial agent&#8208;whose role is to convert the catalyst back into its original oxidation state. However, an additive may cause a side reaction thus decreasing the selectivity and overall efficiency. Herein, we present a novel approach towards chemoselective photooxidation reactions based on suitable solvent&#8208;acetonitrile acting simultaneously as an electron acceptor for catalyst recovery, and on anaerobic conditions. This is allowed by the unique properties of the catalyst, 7,8&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;phenyl&#8208;5&#8208;deazaflavinium chloride existing in both strongly oxidizing and reducing forms, whose strength is increased by excitation with visible light. Usefulness of this system is demonstrated in chemoselective dehydrogenations of 4&#8208;methoxy&#8208; and 4&#8208;chlorobenzyl alcohols to aldehydes without over&#8208;oxidation to benzoic acids achieving yields up to 70&#8201;%. 4&#8208;Substituted 1&#8208;phenylethanols were oxidized to ketones with yields 80&#8211;100&#8201;% and, moreover, with yields 31&#8208;98&#8201;% in the presence of benzylic methyl group, diphenylmethane or thioanisole which are readily oxidized in the presence of oxygen but these were untouched with our system. Mechanistic studies based on UV&#8208;Vis spectro&#8208;electrochemistry, EPR and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy measurements showed that the process involving an electron release from an excited deazaflavin radical to acetonitrile under formation of solvated electron is crucial for the catalyst recovery.

         <title>Anion Recognition with Antimony(III) and Bismuth(III) Triaryl&#8208;Based Pnictogen Bonding Receptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 67, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Antimony(III) and Bismuth(III) pnictogen bonding (PnB) triaryl&#8208;based anion receptors demonstrate PnB anion binding strength is influenced strongly by the electronic withdrawing nature of the aryl substituent and pnictogen atom donor identity. The triaryl PnB receptors display chloride anion selectivity over a range of halides and oxoanions. The synthesis and preliminary chloride anion binding investigations of the first mixed PnB&#8208;HB anion host systems are also described.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterisation of a library of acyclic antimony(III) and bismuth(III) triaryl pnictogen bonding (PnB) receptor systems are reported. In the first&#8208;generation receptor series, quantitative 1H&#8197;NMR chloride titration experiments in THF solvent media reveal halide anion binding potency is intimately correlated with both the electronic&#8208;withdrawing nature of the aryl&#8208; substituent and the polarisability of the PnB donor. Further extensive anion binding investigations with the most potent Sb&#8208; and Bi&#8208;based PnB receptors: 1&#8901;Sb2CF3 and 1&#8901;Bi2CF3, reveal novel selectivity profiles, both displaying Cl&#8722; selectivity relative to the heavier halides and, impressively, to a range of highly basic oxoanions. The synthesis and preliminary chloride anion binding studies of a series of novel tripodal tris&#8208;proto&#8208;triazole triaryl Sb(III) and Bi(III) mixed PnB&#8208;HB receptor systems are also described. Whereas parent triphenyl Sb(III) and Bi(III) compounds are incapable of binding Cl&#8722; in THF solvent media, the PnB&#8208;triazole HB host systems exhibit notable halide affinity.

Low coordination number yet stable: The synthesis and characterisation of new low&#8208;valent palladium (0) complexes are reported, and provide simple access to known and novel complexes, the instrinsic reactivity of which prevented their isolation using existing methods. One complex performs exceptionally well as a catalyst in the hydrosilylation reaction.







Abstract
The synthesis and isolation of [Pd(NHC)(PhC&#8801;CPh)] complexes are reported. These new 14&#8208;electron Pd(0)&#8208;complexes are key synthons leading to known palladium(0) and palladium(II) species, as well as permitting access to unprecedented mixed NHC&#8208;phosphite palladium(0) complexes. This motif permits the facile catalytic hydrosilylation of allenes. DFT calculations have allowed the characterization of the relatively weak interaction between the metal and the diphenylacetylene ligand, with a comparison with a series of ligands with more or less coordinating power, bearing varied structural and electronic properties.

         <title>Switching Chirophilic Self&#8208;assembly: From meso&#8208;structures to Conglomerates in Liquid and Liquid Crystalline Network Phases of Achiral Polycatenar Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 67, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The change of the interhelical self&#8208;assembly from enantiophilic to enantiophobic takes place by reduction of the alkyl chain length and leads to a phase transition from the achiral double gyroid via a tetragonal phase to a chiral triple network phase, associated with a transition from an achiral to a mirror symmetry broken liquid.







Abstract
Spontaneous generation of chirality from achiral molecules is a contemporary research topic with numerous implications for technological applications and for the understanding of the development of homogeneous chirality in biosystems. Herein, a series of azobenzene based rod&#8208;like molecules with an 3,4,5&#8208;trialkylated end and a single n&#8208;alkyl chain involving 5 to 20 aliphatic carbons at the opposite end is reported. Depending on the chain length and temperature these achiral molecules self&#8208;assemble into a series of liquid and liquid crystalline (LC) helical network phases. A chiral isotropic liquid (Iso1[*]) and a cubic triple network phase with chiral I23 lattice were found for the short chain compounds, whereas non&#8208;cubic and achiral cubic phases dominate for the long chain compounds. Among them a mesoscale conglomerate with I23 lattice, a tetragonal phase (Tetbi) containing one chirality synchronized and one non&#8208;synchronized achiral network, an achiral double network meso&#8208;structure with Ia
d space group and an achiral percolated isotropic liquid mesophase (Iso1) were found. This sequence is attributed to an increasing strength of chirality synchronization between the networks, combined with a change of the preferred mode of chirophilic self&#8208;assembly between the networks, switching from enantiophilic to enantiophobic with decreasing chain length and lowering temperature. These nanostructured and mirror symmetry broken LC phases exist over wide temperature ranges which is of interest for potential applications in chiral and photosensitive functional materials derived from achiral compounds.

         <title>Cobalt Cyclopentadienyl&#8208;Phosphine Dinitrogen Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 67, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By reducing cobalt chloride complexes under a dinitrogen atmosphere, cobalt dinitrogen complexes and binuclear cobalt tetra&#8208;dinitrogen complexes were formed. The cobalt dinitrogen complex could react with white phosphorus to afford a dinuclear cobalt complex bearing a cyclo&#8208;P4 moiety.







Abstract
By applying the potassium salts of cyclopentadienyl&#8208;phosphine ligands LK to CoCl2, the corresponding cobalt chlorides (1, LCoIICl) were prepared. By reducing complexes 1 with KHBEt3 under a N2 atmosphere, bridging end&#8208;on complexes, LCoI&#8722;N2&#8722;CoIL (2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b), were successfully obtained. 15N2&#8208;labeled [15N2]&#8208;2&#8201;a was prepared under 15N2/14N2 exchange in THF solution. LCoI&#8722;N2&#8722;CoIL complex 2&#8201;a could react with P4 molecules to release N2 and generate a Co&#8722;P4&#8722;Co moiety 4. Further reduction of complex 2&#8201;b led to cleavage of a P&#8722;C bond in the cyclopentadienyl&#8208;phosphine ligand to provide novel &#956;&#8208;PCy2&#8208;bridged Co0&#8722;N2 complex 5. DFT calculations confirmed the experimental observations.

         <title>Unprecedented Combination of Polyketide Natural Product Fragments Identifies the New Hedgehog Signaling Pathway Inhibitor Grismonone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 67, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical evolution of polyketide natural products leads to the unprecedented combination of biosynthetically related fragments in arrangements not found in Nature. The pseudo&#8208;natural product grismonone was identified to be a potent inhibitor of Hedgehog signaling &#8211; a bioactivity that is not shared by its guiding fragments.







Abstract
Pseudo&#8208;natural products (pseudo&#8208;NPs) are de novo combinations of natural product (NP) fragments that define novel bioactive chemotypes. For their discovery, new design principles are being sought. Previously, pseudo&#8208;NPs were synthesized by the combination of fragments originating from biosynthetically unrelated NPs to guarantee structural novelty and novel bioactivity. We report the combination of fragments from biosynthetically related NPs in novel arrangements to yield a novel chemotype with activity not shared by the guiding fragments. We describe the synthesis of the polyketide pseudo&#8208;NP grismonone and identify it as a structurally novel and potent inhibitor of Hedgehog signaling. The insight that the de novo combination of fragments derived from biosynthetically related NPs may also yield new biologically relevant compound classes with unexpected bioactivity may be considered a chemical extension or diversion of existing biosynthetic pathways and greatly expands the opportunities for exploration of biologically relevant chemical space by means of the pseudo&#8208;NP principle.

         <title>Reactivity of Sodium Pentaphospholide Na[cyclo&#8208;P5] towards C&#8801;E (E=C, N, P) Triple Bonds</title>

[Cyclo&#8208;P5]&#8722; reacts with alkynes and the isolobal nitriles and phosphaalkynes to generate novel, aromatic, five&#8208;membered heterocycles. DFT calculations give insight into the mechanism of the reaction. The anionic ligands coordinate in an &#951;5&#8208;fashion towards FeII to give the corresponding (aza)phosphametallocenes, which could be characterized crystallographically.







Abstract
A diglyme solution of Na[cyclo&#8208;P5] (1) reacts with alkynes and isolobal nitriles and phosphaalkynes to afford the otherwise elusive (aza)phospholide anions 2&#8201;a&#8211;c, 4&#8201;a,b, and 6. The reaction of Na[cyclo&#8208;P5] with alkynes and nitriles was studied by means of DFT methods, which suggested a concerted mechanism for the formation of 2&#8201;a and 4&#8201;b. The anions 2&#8201;a&#8211;c, 4&#8201;a,b, and 6 coordinate in an &#951;5&#8208;fashion towards FeII to give the sandwich (aza)phosphametallocenes 3&#8201;a&#8211;c, 5&#8201;a,b and 7 in moderate to good yields. The new compounds were characterized by means of multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and cyclic voltammetry.

         <title>A Symmetrically &#960;&#8208;Expanded Carbazole Incorporating Fluoranthene Moieties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 67, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Building big. A symmetrically &#960;&#8208;expanded carbazole incorporating fluoranthene moieties was assembled through a five&#8208;step synthetic route. In comparison to parent N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;substituted carbazole the compound features significantly bathochromically shifted UV&#8208;Vis absorption and emission maxima with considerably increased photoluminescence quantum yield. The &#960;&#8208;expansion results in facilitated oxidation with improved reversibility, while at the same time, the aromaticity of the central carbazole moiety remains unaffected.







Abstract
A novel doubly cyclopentannulated carbazole which is accessible through a successive &#960;&#8208;expansion of di(1&#8208;naphthylamine) is disclosed. The carbazole moiety is generated in the final step through intramolecular oxidative coupling. The &#960;&#8208;expansion of carbazole resulted in strongly altered optoelectronic and electrochemical properties. The solid&#8208;state structure features an interesting packing motif with alternating face&#8208;to&#8208;face &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and edge&#8208;to&#8208;face C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions. The experimental findings were corroborated by theoretical calculations.

Abstract
The unprecedented co&#8208;thermolysis of decaborane(14) (nido&#8208;B10H14) and toluene results in a novel porous material (that we have named &#8220;activated borane&#8221;) containing micropores between 1.0 and 1.5&#8197;nm in diameter and a specific surface area of 774&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 (Ar, 87&#8197;K) that is thermally stable up to 1000&#8201;&#176;C. Solid state 1H, 11B and 13C&#8197;MAS NMR, UV&#8208;vis and IR spectroscopies suggest an amorphous structure of borane clusters interconnected by toluene moieties in a ratio of about three toluene molecules for every borane cluster. In addition, the structure contains Lewis&#8208;acidic tri&#8208;coordinated boron sites giving it some unique properties. Activated borane displays high sorption capacity for pollutants such as sulfamethoxazole, tramadol, diclofenac and bisphenol A that exceed the capacity of commercially&#8208;available activated carbon. The consistency in properties for each batch made, and the ease of its synthesis, make activated borane a promising porous material worthy of broad attention.

         <title>Chemiluminescent Imaging Assay of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Protein with Target&#8208;Induced Enzyme Activity Regulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 67, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemiluminescent imaging assay (CLIA) is designed for sensitive and simple detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) based on a target&#8208;induced enzyme activity regulation (T&#8208;EAR) strategy. The T&#8208;EAR uses a proximity binding&#8208;induced RCA process to produce PPi and a PPi&#8208;mediated enzyme activity regulation process to retain HRP activity for signal generation. This CLIA is wash&#8208;free and can detect SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 NP down to 1&#8197;pg/mL (13&#8197;fM) with only 0.75&#8197;&#956;L of sample.







Abstract
Simple but robust testing assays are essential for screening and diagnosis of individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) in COVID&#8208;19 pandemic. Here, we described a chemiluminescent imaging assay (CLIA) for sensitive and convenient detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) by a target&#8208;induced enzyme activity regulation (T&#8208;EAR) strategy. The T&#8208;EAR used a pair of antibody&#8208;DNA probes to recognize SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 NP and proximity&#8208;induce rolling circle amplification for mass&#8208;production of pyrophosphate to coordinate with Cu2+, which prevented the reduction of Cu2+ to Cu+ by sodium ascorbate as well as the Cu+&#8208;caused inactivation of horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The activity retention of HRP produced strong CL signal for the detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 NP by catalyzing the oxidation of luminol by H2O2. The T&#8208;EAR based CLIA showed a wide detection range from 1&#8197;pg/mL to 100&#8197;ng/mL (13&#8197;fM to 1.3&#8197;nM) with the requirement of only 0.75&#8197;&#956;L of sample. This CLIA had advantages of good sensitivity, simple wash&#8208;free operation, acceptable accuracy, and high&#8208;throughput imaging detection, displaying potential applicability in screening assay of COVID&#8208;19 infection.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Reaction in Water to Imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridazines as Switchable DSEgens, AIEgens, and ACQgens
</title>

         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;promoted Pd&#8208;catalyzed cascade reactions realized the discovery of DSEgens with switchable capacity to AIEgens and ACQgens under mild reaction conditions. (DSE=dual&#8208;state emission, AIE=aggregation&#8208;induced emissions, ACQ=aggregation&#8208;caused quenching).







Abstract
Dual&#8208;state emission (DSE) luminophores exhibit strong emissions in both solution and solid states, filling the gaps between aggregation&#8208;induced emissions (AIE) and aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ). However, limited design concepts and complicated synthetic strategies restrict the discovery of novel DSE molecules. Developing efficient and green methodologies to access novel DSE scaffolds via rational design remains highly desirable. In this work, we report a water&#8208;promoted Pd&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction for the synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridazine derivatives with DSE properties. The intramolecular interactions of the neighboring benzene rings restrict molecular motion, leading to emissions in the solid state (quantum yield: 11&#8201;%), and the newly constructed core structure of imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridazine ensures considerable planarity, allowing for emissions in solution. Further removal of the neighboring phenyl groups resulted in ACQgens, while additional methyl groups led to AIEgens. Subsequent live cell imaging investigations suggested that the novel DSEgens could serve as specific lipid droplet (LD) probes in a wide concentration range.

         <title>Fabrication of Nb2O5/Carbon Submicrostructures for Advanced Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 67, December 1, 2022. </description>

Nb2O5/Carbon (C) submicrostructures are fabricated by using a solvothermal method followed by a calcination process. As lithium ion batterie anodes, the Nb2O5/C submicrostructures exhibit outstanding rate behavior and cyclic performance. The superior electrochemical property is attributed to the distinctive structure for Nb2O5/C submicrostructures, in which Nb2O5 nanoparticles uniformly distributed within Nb2O5/C composite can protect Nb2O5 nanoparticles from agglomeration, and the porous carbon matrix can enhance electron/ion conductivity.







Abstract
Nb2O5 possesses superior fast Li+ storage capability for LIB anodes, benefiting from its fast pseudocapacitive behavior and low volumetric change within the cycling processes. However, the poor electric conductivity for Nb2O5 restricts its reaction kinetics and rate property. Herein, Nb2O5/carbon (C) submicrostructures are fabricated by solvothermal method followed by calcination process. The Nb2O5/C submicrostructures exhibit outstanding rate behavior and cyclic performance (332&#8197;(194)&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1000&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;(5)&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). The superior electrochemical property is attributed to the distinctive structure for Nb2O5/C submicrostructures, in which Nb2O5 nanoparticles uniformly distributed within Nb2O5/C composite can protect Nb2O5 nanoparticles from agglomeration, and the porous carbon matrix can enhance electron/ion conductivity. This work furnishes a novel strategy for fabricating Nb2O5/C submicrostructures with superior Li+ storage performance, which can be potentially used to design other metal oxide/C submicrostructures for second battery anode.

         <title>Interactive Bioconjugation at N&#8208;Terminal Cysteines by Using O&#8208;Salicylaldehyde Esters towards Dual Site&#8208;Selective Functionalization</title>

Two&#8208;way protection: O&#8208;Salicylaldehyde esters are suitable handles for the site&#8208;specific protection of N&#8208;terminal cysteines on native peptides. The resulting phenolic thiazolidines present tunable stability through careful pH control that allows the orthogonal multifunctionalization of different Cys residues driven by interactive site&#8208;selective peptide modifications.







Abstract
N&#8208;terminal Cys modification has been intensively studied to produce homogeneous bioconjugates essentially through two modes of reaction: reversible modification with the equilibrium shifted towards the formation of the desired conjugate or stable and irreversible conjugates. Herein, we report a new method of N&#8208;terminal cysteine modification using O&#8208;salicylaldehyde esters (OSAEs) through fast conjugation and irreversible deconjugation. These reagents can rapidly react with N&#8208;terminal Cys at low&#8208;micromolar concentration to form thiazolidines with subsequent hydrolysis of the ester moiety to the phenolic derivative. These phenolic thiazolidines can be hydrolyzed at acidic pH (&#8776;4.5) to recover the intact N&#8208;terminal Cys. Bioconjugation reactions using OSAEs offer controlled reversibility to as act as a protecting group for N&#8208;terminal cysteines, allowing the modification of in&#8208;chain residues without perturbing the N&#8208;terminal Cys, which can then be deprotected and used as a conjugation site.

         <title>Magnetic Hyperthermia Enhancement in Iron&#8208;based Materials Driven by Carbon Support Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 67, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The control of both the thickness of the protective carbon layer, and the size and composition of the nascent confined iron nanoparticles is driven by carbon support interactions. The iron hybrid materials (Fe3C@C/CNFAC) obtained from acid&#8208;treated carbon supports exhibit enhanced specific absorption rate values in biocompatible media.







Abstract
Magnetic hyperthermia (MH) shows great potential in clinical applications because of its very localized action and minimal side effects. Because of their high saturation magnetization values, reduced forms of iron are promising candidates for MH. However, they must be protected in order to overcome their toxicity and instability (i.&#8201;e., oxidation) under biological conditions. In this work, a novel methodology for the protection of iron nanoparticles through confinement within graphitic carbon layers after thermal treatment of preformed nanoparticles supported on carbon is reported. We demonstrate that the size and composition of the nascent confined iron nanoparticles, as well as the thickness of their protective carbon layer can be controlled by selecting the nature of the carbon support. Our findings reveal that a higher nanoparticle&#8211;carbon interaction, mediated by the presence of oxygen&#8208;containing groups, induces the formation of small and well&#8208;protected &#945;&#8208;Fe&#8208;based nanoparticles that exhibit promising results towards MH based on their enhanced specific absorption rate values.

         <title>A Lewis Acid Stabilized Ketenimine in an Unusual Variant of the Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 67, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By the action of a strong Lewis acid, isomerization of the tricyanomethane to the ketenimine, HN=C=C(CN)2, is triggered, which in turn directly attacks an aromatic species in an electrophilic aromatic substitution.







Abstract
Electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) can provide a straightforward approach to the efficient synthesis of functionalized complex aromatic molecules. In general, Lewis acids serve as a beneficial stimulus for the formation of a Wheland complex, the intermediate in the classical SEAr mechanism of EAS, which is responsible for H/E (E=electrophile) substitution under formal H+ elimination. Herein, we report an unusual variant of EAS, in which a complex molecule such as the tricyanomethane, HC(CN)3, is activated with a strong Lewis acid (B(C6F5)3) to the point where it can finally be used in an EAS. However, the Lewis acid here causes the isomerization of the tricyanomethane to the ketenimine, HN=C=C(CN)2, which in turn directly attacks the aromatic species in the EAS, with simultaneous proton migration of the aromatic proton to the imino group, so that no elimination occurs that is otherwise observed in the SEAr mechanism. By this method, it is possible to build up amino&#8208;malononitrile&#8208;substituted aromatic compounds in one step.

         <title>Highly Efficient Au(I) Alkynyl Emitters: Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence and Solution&#8208;Processed OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 67, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new alkynyl Au(I) carbene complex with tunable electronic structure shows high efficiency thermally activated fluorescence (TADF). Solution&#8208;processed OLEDs made with these complexes achieve high external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of up to 20.4&#8201;%, manifesting the bright prospect of Au(I)&#8208;TADF emitters in OLEDs.







Abstract
Two&#8208;coordinate donor&#8208;metal&#8208;acceptor type coinage metal complexes displaying efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) have been unveiled to be highly appealing candidates as emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Herein a series of green to yellow TADF gold(I) complexes with alkynyl ligands has been developed for the first time. The complexes exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of up to 0.76 in doped films (5&#8197;wt&#8201;% in PMMA) at room temperature. The modifications of alkynyl ligands with electron&#8208;donating amino groups together with the use of electron&#8208;deficient carbene ligands induce ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer excited states that give rise to TADF emission. Spectroscopic and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the roles of electron&#8208;donating capability of the alkynyl ligand in tuning the excited&#8208;state properties. Solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) using the present complexes as emitters achieve maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of up to 20&#8201;%.

         <title>Three&#8208;ligand Co&#8208;assembled 2D Au(I)&#8208;Thiolate Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 67, December 1, 2022. </description>

Au(I)&#8208;thiolate nanosheets with closely&#8208;packed multiple surface functional groups have been synthesized via a one&#8208;pot co&#8208;assembly strategy. The easy but powerful strategy addresses the surface engineering problem for 2D materials and paves the way for their wider applications in sensing and biomaterials.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Au(I)&#8208;thiolate assemblies are a special type of material that can balance high structural stability and rich surface functionality, which shows promising prospects in both fundamental research and applications. Co&#8208;assembly of multiple ligands is a facile way to further enrich the surface properties and functions, and expand their application potentials. In this work, taking 3&#8208;mercaptopropionic acid (MPA), cysteine (Cys) and 1&#8208;thioglycerol (TGO) as example ligands, we studied in detail the possibility to co&#8208;assemble them into one nanosheet. Although the three ligands have significantly different controllability and pathways when self&#8208;assembling individually with Au(I), they can still be effectively co&#8208;assembled by reacting with HAuCl4 together to obtain three&#8208;ligand nanosheets with good colloidal stability. The key points for successful co&#8208;assembly are also revealed by comparing single&#8208; and three&#8208;ligand self&#8208;assembly processes, laying a solid foundation for co&#8208;assembly of even more ligands. The easy but powerful strategy for 2D materials with closely&#8208;packed and multiple tunable surface functional groups addresses the surface engineering problem for 2D materials and paves the way for their wider applications in sensing and biomaterials.

&lt;p&gt;Two-dimensional (2D) Au(I)-thiolate assemblies are a special type of material that can balance high structural stability and rich surface functionality, which shows promising prospects in both fundamental research and applications. Co-assembly of multiple ligands is a facile way to further enrich the surface properties and functions, and expand their application potentials. In this work, taking 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA), cysteine (Cys) and 1-thioglycerol (TGO) as example ligands, we studied in detail the possibility to co-assemble them into one nanosheet. Although the three ligands have significantly different controllability and pathways when self-assembling individually with Au(I), they can still be effectively co-assembled by reacting with HAuCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; together to obtain three-ligand nanosheets with good colloidal stability. The key points for successful co-assembly are also revealed by comparing single- and three-ligand self-assembly processes, laying a solid foundation for co-assembly of even more ligands. The easy but powerful strategy for 2D materials with closely-packed and multiple tunable surface functional groups addresses the surface engineering problem for 2D materials and paves the way for their wider applications in sensing and biomaterials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Differential Tunneling&#8208;Driven and Vibrationally&#8208;Induced Reactivity in Isomeric Benzazirines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 67, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum tunneling and IR vibrational excitation chemistry was discovered to manifest differently in two isomeric benzazirines generated in cryogenic matrices. Computations show that these reactive intermediates have distinct energy profiles regarding two competitive bond&#8208;breaking/bond&#8208;forming pathways. These exceptional results allow probing into the fundamental nature of such unconventional types of chemical reactivity.







Abstract
Quantum mechanical tunneling of heavy&#8208;atoms and vibrational excitation chemistry are unconventional and scarcely explored types of reactivity. Once fully understood, they might bring new avenues to conduct chemical transformations, providing access to a new world of molecules or ways of exquisite reaction control. In this context, we present here the discovery of two isomeric benzazirines exhibiting differential tunneling&#8208;driven and vibrationally&#8208;induced reactivity, which constitute exceptional results for probing into the nature of these phenomena. The isomeric 6&#8208;fluoro&#8208; and 2&#8208;fluoro&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2H&#8208;benzazirines (3&#8208;a and 3&#8242;&#8208;s) were generated in cryogenic krypton matrices by visible&#8208;light irradiation of the corresponding triplet nitrene 32&#8208;a, which was produced by UV&#8208;light irradiation of its azide precursor. The 3&#8242;&#8208;s was found to be stable under matrix dark conditions, whereas 3&#8208;a spontaneously rearranges (&#964;1/2 &#8764;64&#8197;h at 10 and 20&#8197;K) by heavy&#8208;atom tunneling to 32&#8208;a. Near&#8208;IR&#8208;light irradiation at the first OH stretching overtone frequencies (remote vibrational antenna) of the benzazirines induces the 3&#8242;&#8208;s ring&#8208;expansion reaction to a seven&#8208;member cyclic ketenimine, but the 3&#8208;a undergoes 2H&#8208;azirine ring&#8208;opening reaction to triplet nitrene 32&#8208;a. Computations demonstrate that 3&#8208;a and 3&#8242;&#8208;s have distinct reaction energy profiles, which explain the different experimental results. The spectroscopic direct measurement of the tunneling of 3&#8208;a to 32&#8208;a constitutes a unique example of an observation of a species reacting only by nitrogen tunneling. Moreover, the vibrationally&#8208;induced sole activation of the most favorable bond&#8208;breaking/bond&#8208;forming pathway available for 3&#8208;a and 3&#8242;&#8208;s provides pioneer results regarding the selective nature of such processes.

         <title>Hydrostannylation of Red Phosphorus: A Convenient Route to Monophosphines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 67, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Valuable, industrially and academically relevant monophosphorus compounds are accessible directly from red phosphorus by using commonly available reagents. Only modest inert&#8208;atmosphere techniques are needed, making this a convenient and practical methodology for the preparation of P1 compounds from elemental, red phosphorus.







Abstract
The preparation of valuable and industrially relevant organophosphorus compounds currently depends on indirect multistep procedures involving difficult&#8208;to&#8208;handle white phosphorus as a common P atom source. Herein, we report a practical and versatile method for the synthesis of a variety of monophosphorus compounds directly from the bench&#8208;stable allotrope red phosphorus (Pred). The relatively inert Pred was productively functionalised by using the cheap and readily available radical reagent tri&#8208;n&#8208;butyltin hydride, and subsequent treatment with electrophiles yields useful P1 compounds. Remarkably, these transformations require only modest inert&#8208;atmosphere techniques and use only reagents that are inexpensive and commercially available, making this a convenient and practical methodology accessible in most laboratory settings.

Chitosan, the deacetylated version of the second most abundant biopolymer chitin, has attracted increasing attention for applications in medicine, cosmetics, agriculture, water purification, and more. It is an alternative to current fossil&#8208;fuel&#8208;based polymers due to its nontoxic, biocompatible, and biodegradable nature. This review (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202156) by E. Cohen and E. Poverenov highlights synthetic modifications to achieve more hydrophilic chitosan derivatives and their potential use as functional materials.

         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Terminal cysteine is a hot&#8208;spot for bioconjugation that enables the construction of complex bioconjugates. In this study, we show that O&#8208;salicylaldehyde esters are a fast and selective reagent for modifying N&#8208;terminal cysteine, which can be easily removed under acidic conditions, and used in dual site&#8208;selective bioconjugations.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;N-Terminal cysteine&lt;/b&gt; is a hot-spot for bioconjugation that enables the construction of complex bioconjugates. In this study, we show that &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-salicylaldehyde esters are a fast and selective reagent for modifying N-terminal cysteine, which can be easily removed under acidic conditions, and used in dual site-selective bioconjugations.

Zn&#8211;air batteries: The development of TMS catalysts and their applications in ZABs is discussed. We focus on the means of improving the electrocatalytic performance of TMS, such as defect introduction, interface engineering, and structural regulation. Finally, some challenges and opportunities in TMS electrocatalysis research are briefly presented, and strategies for improving the performance of ZABs are prospected.







Abstract
Due to the energy crisis by the excessive consumption of fossil fuels, Zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) with high theoretical energy density have attracted people&#8216;s attention. The overall performance of ZABs is largely determined by the air cathode catalyst. Therefore, it is necessary to develop high&#8208;efficiency and low&#8208;cost bifunctional catalysts to replace noble metal catalysts to promote the development of ZABs. Among a variety of cathode catalysts, TMS has become a research hotspot in recent years because of its better electrical conductivity than metal phosphides and metal oxides. In this work, we focus on the means of improving the electrocatalytic performance of transition&#8208;metal sulfides (TMS) providing ideas for us to rationally design high&#8208;performance catalysts. Furthermore, the performance improvement law between catalyst performance and ZABs is also discussed in this work. Finally, some challenges and opportunities faced in the research of TMS electrocatalysis are briefly proposed, and strategies for improving the performance of ZABs are prospected.

         <title>Hydrophilic Chitosan Derivatives: Synthesis and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 67, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A benign and low&#8208;cost alternative for fossil&#8208;fuel&#8208;sourced polymers, chitosan has tremendous potential because of its bioactivity, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and low toxicity. Synthetic pathways for chitosan derivatives with improved water solubility, and their associated applications, are explored. With the change in global direction towards a lower carbon economy and reduced environmental impact, fine&#8208;tuning chitosan properties is essential for a better future.







Abstract
Polymer alternatives sourced from nature have attracted increasing attention for applications in medicine, cosmetics, agriculture, food, water purification, and more. Among them, chitosan is the most versatile due to its full biodegradability, exceptional biocompatibility, multipurpose bioactivity, and low toxicity. Although remarkable progress has been made in its synthetic modification by using C3/C6 secondary/primary hydroxy (&#8722;OH) and the C2 amino (&#8722;NH2) active sites, its solubility under physiological conditions remains limited and has hampered larger&#8208;scale adoption. This review summarizes different synthetic methods that increase chitosan&#8216;s hydrophilicity and water solubility by using covalent modifications, namely amino acid addition, quaternary ammonium formation, phosphorylation, and carboxymethylation. We also review several applications for each type of substitution in fields such as cosmetics, medicine, agriculture, and water purification, and provide an outlook and perspective for future modifications and implementations.

         <title>Chlorination&#8208;Assisted Isomerically Pure Oxindole&#8208;Terminated Quinoids for n&#8208;Type Organic Thin&#8208;Film Transistors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quinoidal compounds have great potential utility as high&#8208;performance organic semiconducting materials because of their rigid planar structures and extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation. However, the existence of E and Z isomers adversely affects the charge&#8208;transport properties of quinoidal compounds. In this study, we developed three isomerically pure oxindole&#8208;terminated quinoids by introducing chlorine atoms in the quinoidal core. The synthesized quinoids were confirmed to have a Z,Z configuration by means of 1H NMR spectroscopy, density functional theory calculations, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Importantly, the strategy of chlorination allowed to maintain low&#8208;lying frontier molecular orbital energy levels and ensure favorable intermolecular packing. Consequently, all three quinoidal compounds showed n&#8208;type transport characteristics in organic thin&#8208;film transistors, with electron mobilities up to 0.35 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, which is the highest value reported to date for oxindole&#8208;terminated quinoids. We believe that our study can provide new guidelines for the design of isomerically pure quinoids with high electron mobilities.</dc:description>

         <title>Programmable Photocatalytic Activity of Multicomponent Covalent Organic Frameworks Used as Metallaphotocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various multicomponent COFs bearing both a moiety for photosensitization and complexation of nickel catalysts were synthesized using reticulation with different 1,3,5&#8208;triformylbenzene nodes. This enabled the switching between persistent, charge&#8208;separated species or efficient charge&#8208;carrier mobility for different metallaphotocatalytic cross&#8208;coupling reactions based on the node unit. The frameworks showed recyclability and the possibility to drive the reactions using red light irradiation.







Abstract
The multicomponent approach allows to incorporate several functionalities into a single covalent organic framework (COF) and consequently allows the construction of bifunctional materials for cooperative catalysis. The well&#8208;defined structure of such multicomponent COFs is furthermore ideally suited for structure&#8208;activity relationship studies. We report a series of multicomponent COFs that contain acridine&#8208; and 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine linkers connected through 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetrialdehyde derivatives. The acridine motif is responsible for broad light absorption, while the bipyridine unit enables complexation of nickel catalysts. These features enable the usage of the framework materials as catalysts for light&#8208;mediated carbon&#8722;heteroatom cross&#8208;couplings. Variation of the node units shows that the catalytic activity correlates to the keto&#8208;enamine tautomer isomerism. This allows switching between high charge&#8208;carrier mobility and persistent, localized charge&#8208;separated species depending on the nodes, a tool to tailor the materials for specific reactions. Moreover, nickel&#8208;loaded COFs are recyclable and catalyze cross&#8208;couplings even using red light irradiation.

         <title>Boosting Ring Strain and Lewis Acidity of Borirane: Synthesis, Reactivity and Density Functional Theory Studies of an Uncoordinated Arylborirane Fused to o&#8208;Carborane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An uncoordinated o&#8208;carborane&#8208;fused arylborirane was synthesized, which not only allows the 1,2&#8208;insertion of C=O or C&#8801;N to proceed under milder conditions, but also enables the heretofore unknown dearomative 1,4&#8208;insertion of Ar&#8722;(C=O)&#8722; into a B&#8722;C bond. The detailed computational mechanism studies show the relevance of both ring strain and Lewis acidity to the unique reaction profiles.







Abstract
Among the parent borirane, benzoborirene and ortho&#8208;dicarbadodecaborane&#8208;fused borirane, the latter possesses the highest ring strain and the highest Lewis acidity according to our density functional theory (DFT) studies. The synthesis of this class of compounds is thus considerably challenging. The existing examples require either a strong &#960;&#8208;donating group or an extra ligand for B&#8208;coordination, which nevertheless suppresses or completely turns off the Lewis acidity. The title compound, which possesses both features, not only allows the 1,2&#8208;insertion of P=O, C=O or C&#8801;N to proceed under milder conditions, but also enables the heretofore unknown dearomative 1,4&#8208;insertion of Ar&#8722;(C=O)&#8722; into a B&#8722;C bond. The fusion of strained molecular systems to an o&#8208;carborane cage shows great promise for boosting both the ring strain and acidity.

         <title>Synthesis of Sterically Encumbered Thiourea S&#8208;Oxides through Direct Thiourea Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulking up: Thiourea S&#8208;oxides are usually short&#8208;lived reactive intermediates in the oxidation of thioureas and can be considered as heavier homologues of the elusive N&#8208;heterocyclic Criegee intermediates. Preparation and isolation was possible by introduction of bulky substituents on the nitrogen atoms.







Abstract
Thiourea S&#8208;oxides can be viewed as formal analogs of the currently unknown diamino&#8208;substituted Criegee intermediates (urea O&#8208;oxides). However, the preparation of such S&#8208;oxides is rather challenging, and the direct oxidation of thioureas typically only leads to formation of desulfurized products. Employing the accurate revDSD&#8208;PBEP86&#8208;D4 double hybrid density functional, it was found that the peracid mediated oxidation of thiourea S&#8208;oxides exhibits a lower reaction barrier than the oxidation of the corresponding thiourea itself in contrast to most other ordinary thioketones. The undesired overoxidation reactivity, which is associated with strong &#960;&#8208;donation from the thiourea's nitrogen atoms, can be partially suppressed by introduction of bulky substituents and the utilization of protic solvents. In this regard, we managed to prepare two sterically encumbered thiourea S&#8208;oxides in isolated yields of 35&#8211;40&#8201;%. The S&#8208;oxides are stable in the solid state and in alcoholic solutions at room temperature for extended periods of time, but swiftly decompose in aprotic solvents by disproportionation. A dimesityl&#8208;substituted thiourea S&#8208;oxide complexed with residual mCBA could be characterized by means of X&#8208;ray crystallography, confirming the importance of hydrogen bonding in the stabilization of the amino&#8208;substituted C=S+&#8722;O&#8722; moiety.

         <dc:description>
Pd(II) coordinated by N&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;l&#8208;phenylalanine has been identified as a highly enantioselective catalyst for atroposelective C&#8722;H iodination at room temperature via desymmerization strategy providing nearly enantiopure samples of a diverse range axially chiral biaryl N&#8208;oxides. Mechanistic investigation disclosed the factors that lead to high reactivity and excellent enantiocontrol.







Abstract
The discovery of enantioselective desymmetrization reactions to provide practical synthesis of enantio&#8208;enriched atropisomeric biaryls is a challenging topic in the field of asymmetric catalysis. Herein, we report a highly enantioselective desymmetrization reaction for the synthesis of axially chiral biaryl N&#8208;oxides by atroposelective C&#8722;H iodination by using Pd(II) coordinated by N&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;l&#8208;phenylalanine as a chiral catalyst at room temperature. A broad range of products were obtained in high yields (up to 99&#8201;%) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;% ee). The products could be synthesized in gram scale, one of which was proved to be a powerful organocatalyst in asymmetric allylation reaction. Mechanistic evidence as well as DFT calculations point towards the factors that lead to high reactivity and excellent enantiocontrol in this reaction.

         <title>Photoresponsive Type III Porous Liquids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous liquids have typically focused on static components which require temperature and pressure swings, or sonication, to release gas from the system. Here, a new photoresponsive type&#8197;III porous liquid is reported, formed by dispersing a known photoresponsive metal&#8211;organic framework in an ionic liquid, creating a porous liquid capable of releasing gas upon irradiation with UV light.







Abstract
Porous materials are the subject of extensive research because of potential applications in areas such as gas adsorption and molecular separations. Until recently, most porous materials were solids, but there is now an emerging class of materials known as porous liquids. The incorporation of intrinsic porosity or cavities in a liquid can result in free&#8208;flowing materials that are capable of gas uptakes that are significantly higher than conventional non&#8208;porous liquids. A handful of porous liquids have also been investigated for gas separations. Until now, the release of gas from porous liquids has relied on molecular displacement (e.g., by adding small solvent molecules), pressure or temperature swings, or sonication. Here, we explore a new method of gas release which involves photoisomerisable porous liquids comprising a photoresponsive MOF dispersed in an ionic liquid. This results in the selective uptake of CO2 over CH4 and allows gas release to be controlled by using UV light.

Here, a new photoresponsive type&#8197;III porous liquid is reported, formed by dispersing a known photoresponsive metal&#8211;organic framework in an ionic liquid, creating a porous liquid capable of releasing gas upon irradiation with UV light.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porous materials are the subject of extensive research because of potential applications in areas such as gas adsorption and molecular separations. Until recently, most porous materials were solids, but there is now an emerging class of materials known as porous liquids. The incorporation of intrinsic porosity or cavities in a liquid can result in free-flowing materials that are capable of gas uptakes that are significantly higher than conventional non-porous liquids. A handful of porous liquids have also been investigated for gas separations. Until now, the release of gas from porous liquids has relied on molecular displacement (e.g., by adding small solvent molecules), pressure or temperature swings, or sonication. Here, we explore a new method of gas release which involves photoisomerisable porous liquids comprising a photoresponsive MOF dispersed in an ionic liquid. This results in the selective uptake of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; over CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and allows gas release to be controlled by using UV light.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Activated Single&#8208;Phase Ti4O7 Nanosheets with Efficient Use of Precious Metal for Inspired Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;crystal Ti4O7 nanosheets with super&#8208;high conductivity, electrochemical stability, and corrosion resistance can be a perfect carrier for precious metals. Not only do they achieve synergy with noble&#8208;metal atoms, but they also facilitate an enhanced metal&#8208;support interaction interface under light irradiation. Thus they can provide low&#8208;cost, highly reliable electrode materials (Pt/Ti4O7) for fuel cells used in intermittent renewable energy storage in power grids, especially for districts with harsh conditions. More information can be found in the Research Article by F. Wang, Y. Wang and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202580).

         <title>Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2 Coupled with Organic Conversion to Selectively Synthesize High&#8208;Value Chemicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical process of coupling electrocatalytic CO2 reduction and organic conversion reaction can effectively reduce the reaction overpotential and obtain value&#8208;added chemicals. Moreover, because of the diversity of substrates and the designability of coupling forms, more and more attention has been paid to this field. This review systematically summarizes the research progress of coupling electrolysis in recent years, (1) co&#8208;electrolysis of CO2 and organics at the cathode to obtain specific products with high selectivity, (2) replacing traditional anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with other valuable oxidation reactions to improve energy utilization efficiency and economic benefits of CO2 conversion, (3) in an electrolytic cell without membrane, the cathode and anode jointly transform CO2 and organics to redox products. We hope that the examples and insights on coupling electrolysis introduced in this review can inspire researchers to further explore and innovate in this direction.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular rotational correlation times and nanoviscosity determined by 111mCd perturbed angular correlation (PAC) of &#947;&#8208;rays spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoviscosity experienced by molecules in solution may be determined through measurement of the molecular rotational correlation time, &#964;c. e.g. by fluorescence and NMR spectroscopy. With this work we apply PAC spectroscopy to determine the rate of rotational diffusion, &#955;=1/&#964;c, of a de novo designed protein, TRIL12AL16C, in solutions with viscosities, &#958;, from 1.7 to 88 mPa&#183;s. TRIL12AL16C was selected as molecular probe, because it exhibits minimal effects of intramolecular dynamics and static line broadening, allowing for exclusive elucidation of molecular rotation diffusion. &#955; determined by PAC spectroscopy agrees well with literature data from fluorescence and NMR spectroscopy, and scales linearly with 1/&#958; in agreement with the Stokes&#8208;Einstein&#8208;Debye model. PAC experiments require only trace amounts (&#8275;1011) of probe nuclei and can be conducted over a broad range of sample temperatures and pressures. Moreover, most materials are relatively transparent to &#947;&#8208;rays. Thus, PAC spectroscopy may find applications under circumstances where conventional techniques cannot be applied, spanning from physics of liquids to in vivo biochemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Insights into the Photodynamics of the Fluorescence Emission and Singlet Oxygen Generation of Fluorogen Activating Protein&#8208;Malachite Green&#160;System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The self&#8208;assembled fluorogen activating protein (FAP)&#8208; malachite green (MG) complex is a well&#8208;established protein&#8208;ligand system, which can realize binding&#8208;caused fluorescence turn&#8208;on of MG and singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) generation by MG iodination. To clarify the mechanism of fluorescence activation and the 1 O 2 generation, the photodynamics of different halogen&#8208;substituted MG derivatives and their corresponding MG&#8208;FAP complexes were studied by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and theoretical computation. The results show that the rotation of MG was restricted by FAP binding, which preventing the rapid internal conversion and allowing a long lifetime for the excited MG to undergo fluorescence emission and intersystem crossing. Moreover, these MG&#8208;FAP complexes exhibit obviously varied fluorescence quantum yields ( &#934; FL ) and 1 O 2 yields. The study on the decay pathways indicates that such an anti&#8208;heavy atom effect predominately stems from the lifetimes of the excited&#8208;state species. The photodynamic mechanism study here will lead to more advanced FAP&#8208;MG systems with high spatiotemporal resolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Green emissive copper nanocluster with aggregation&#8208;enhanced emission for selective detection of Al3+</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective detection of Al3+ is of great significance both for the benefit of human health and environmental safety considerations. In this work, a sensitive and selective fluorescence assay for Al3+ was proposed based on the green emissive Cu nanoclusters (Cu NCs). Different from the commonly reported works, the green emissive Cu NCs showed dual emission bands at 450 and 510 nm, attributed to the reaction product between polyvinyl pyrrolidone and ascorbic acid and the Cu core, respectively. Al3+ could induce the aggregation of Cu NCs by forming covalent bonds, which results in the enhancement of photoluminescence intensity. This enhancement phenomenon is rather selective to Al3+, which endows the detection in real samples. These results provide new insights for the fluorescence mechanisms of metal NCs, which also provided a functional luminescent material for various applications, such as chemical sensing, bioimaging and photoelectric devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Hydrolysis of Phosphate Esters: A Route to Calixarene&#8208;Supported Rare&#8208;Earth Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphate ester bonds are widely present in nature (e.g. DNA/RNA) and can be extremely stable against hydrolysis without the help of catalysts. Previously, we showed how the combination of phosphoryl and calix[4]arene moieties in the same organic framework (LPO) allows isolation of single lanthanide (Ln) metal ions as [LnIII(LPO)2](O3SCF3)3. Here we report how by controlling the reaction conditions a new hydrolyzed phosphoryl&#8208;calix[4]arene ligand (H3LHPO) is formed as a result of LnIII&#8208;mediated P&#8211;OEt bond cleavage in three out of the eight possible sites in LPO. The chelating nature of H3LHPO traps the LnIII species in the form of [LnIII(LHPO)((EtO)2P(O)OH)]2 dimers (Ln = La, Dy, Tb, Gd), where the Dy derivative shows slow magnetization relaxation. The strategy presented herein could be extended to access a broader library of hydrolyzed platforms (H x LHPO; x = 1&#8211;8) that may represent mimics of nuclease enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Interrupted Domino Reaction for the Synthesis of Fused Triazolyl Benzothiadiazine&#8208;1&#8208;oxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed domino reactions of 2&#8208;azido sulfoximines with 1&#8208;iodoalkynes yield fused triazolyl&#8208;containing benzothiadiazine&#8208;1&#8208;oxides. The protocol features the synthesis of two fused heterocyclic rings in one step with good to excellent yields and a broad functional group tolerance. Detailed mechanistic investigations indicate that a copper &#960;&#8208;complex initiates a cycloaddition and oxidative C&#8211;N coupling reaction sequence. The results suggest an interrupted domino process involving an iodinated triazole as a key intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites as a heterogeneous Fenton&#8208;like catalyst for organic dye removal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites with Co3O4 as the core, Fe3O4/C as the shell, and a cavity structure were synthesized by the hard template method. The physical and chemical properties of the composites were characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD, TGA, XPS, BET, and VSM. The specific surface area of yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites is 175.9 m2 g&#8208;1, showing superparamagnetic properties. The yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites were used as heterogeneous Fenton catalysts to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to degrade MB, which showed high catalytic degradation performance. The degradation rate of MB reached 100% within 30 min under the circumstances of the yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites dosage of 0.1 g L&#8208;1, the PMS dosage of 1.0 g L&#8208;1, the initial MB concentration of 100 mg L&#8208;1, an initial pH of 5.5, and a temperature of 30&#177;2 &#8451;. The enhanced catalytic performance of the yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the two catalytically active materials and the middle cavity. The effects of different operating parameters and co&#8208;existing anion species on MB degradation were also investigated. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis and quenching experiments confirmed that the formation of SO&#8324;&#775;&#8315;&#160;in the&#160;yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C/PMS system contributes to MB degradation. In addition, yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites can be easily separated from the pollutant solution under the action of an external magnetic field, and the degradation rate of MB can still reach 98% after five cycles, indicating that it has good stability and reusability and has broad application prospects in the field of water purification.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light Thiyl Radical&#8208;Mediated Desilylation of Arylsilanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A straightforward, visible&#8208;light triggered desilylation of arylsilanes by thiyl radicals is presented. Silyl groups are often used to block a reactive position in multi&#8208;step organic synthesis, for which a mild cleavage at a late&#8208;stage will provide new possibilities and disconnection routes by CAr&#8208;Si cleavage/deprotection. In this work, commercially available and cheap disulfides are employed for the first time in this type of C(sp2)&#8208;Si bond cleavage reactions. Thus, upon irradiation with visible&#8208;light, homolytic cleavage of the disulfide give rise to the corresponding thiyl radical that allows for a radical chain mechanism. This methodology represents a mild, fast and simple approach suitable for a broad variety of simply substituted arylsilanes. Moreover, the procedure could be easily extended to natural products and therapeutic derivatives, showing its robustness and synthetic application potential.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Small molecule&#8208;drug conjugates (SMDCs) mimicking the RGD sequence (&#8208;Arg&#8208;Gly&#8208;Asp&#8208;) with a non&#8208;peptide moiety require a pharmacophore&#8208;independent attachment site. A library of 36 sulfonamide&#8208;modified RGD mimetics with nM to pM affinity for integrin &#945;V&#946;3 was synthesized and analysed via DAD mapping. The best structure of the conjugable RGD mimetic was used and a linker was attached to an aromatic ring by Negishi cross&#8208;coupling.

         <title>A Modular Olefination of Aldehydes with Thiols as Coupling Partners</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Olefins range amongst the most important motifs in organic chemistry. Hence, the development of novel olefin syntheses has remained a constant field of research in synthetic chemistry to date. Herein, we report the development of a modular olefination that converts aldehydes into olefins with thiols as reaction partners. The simple, transition metal&#8208;free protocol proceeds via an unsymmetrical bissulfone intermediate which is converted into the respective alkene in a Ramberg&#8208;B&#228;cklund&#8208;type process. Differently substituted olefins can be synthesized from readily available starting materials in typically good yields and stereoselectivites using basic laboratory chemicals exclusively. Complementary reaction conditions differing in the choice of solvent favor the E/Z&#8208;products respectively under kinetic control rendering this protocol an interesting economical addition to the family of olefin syntheses.</dc:description>

         <title>MOF&#8208;derived NiCo&#8208;LDH nanocages on CuO nanorod arrays for robust and high energy density asymmetric supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layered double hydroxide (LDH) is widely explored in supercapacitors on account of its high capacity, adjustable composition and easy synthesis process.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Layered double hydroxide (LDH) is widely explored in supercapacitors on account of its high capacity, adjustable composition and easy synthesis process. Unfortunately, solitary LDH still has great limitations as electrode material due to the shortcomings such as poor conductivity and easy agglomeration. Herein, nanoflakes assembled NiCo-LDH hollow nanocages derived from metal-organic framework (MOF) precursor are strung by CuO nanorods formed from etching and oxidation of copper foam (CF), forming hierarchical CuO@NiCo-LDH heterostructures. The as-synthesized CuO@NiCo-LDH/CF shows large capacitance (5607 mF cm-2 at 1 mA cm-2), superior rate performance (88.3% retention at 10 mA cm&#8211;2) and impressive cycling durability (93.1% capacitance is retained after 5000 cycles), which is significant superior to control CuO/CF, CuO@ZIF-67/CF, NiCo-LDH/CF and Cu(OH)2@NiCo-LDH/CF electrodes. Besides, an asymmetrical supercapacitor consists of CuO@NiCo-LDH/CF and activated carbon displays maximum energy density of 47.3 Wh kg-1, and its capacitance only declines by 6.8% after 10000 cycles, demonstrating remarkable cycling durability.

         <title>Optimization of G&#8208;Quadruplex Ligands through a SAR Study Combining Parallel Synthesis and Screening of Cationic Bis(acylhydrazones)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ready to screen. A library of cationic bis(acylhydrazones) as putative G4&#8208;DNA ligands was prepared by a straightforward condensation of the corresponding building blocks. Screening the resulting samples (without any isolation or purification steps) by fluorescence&#8208;melting experiments identified three novel hits, whose interactions with G4&#8208;DNA targets were studied in detail by several biophysical methods and molecular modeling.







Abstract
G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s), secondary structures adopted by guanine&#8208;rich DNA and RNA sequences, are implicated in numerous biological processes and have been suggested as potential drug targets. Accordingly, there is an increasing interest in developing high&#8208;throughput methods that allow the generation of congeneric series of G4&#8208;targeting molecules (&#8220;ligands&#8221;) and investigating their interactions with the targets. We have developed an operationally simple method of parallel synthesis to generate &#8220;ready&#8208;to&#8208;screen&#8221; libraries of cationic acylhydrazones, a motif that we have previously identified as a promising scaffold for potent, biologically active G4 ligands. Combined with well&#8208;established screening techniques, such as fluorescence melting, this method enables the rapid synthesis and screening of combinatorial libraries of potential G4 ligands. Following this protocol, we synthesized a combinatorial library of 90 bis(acylhydrazones) and screened it against five different nucleic acid structures. This way, we were able to analyze the structure&#8211;activity relationships within this series of G4 ligands, and identified three novel promising ligands whose interactions with G4&#8208;DNAs of different topologies were studied in detail by a combination of several biophysical techniques, including native mass spectrometry, and molecular modeling.

         <title>Aluminium&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Hydroboration of Esters and Epoxides to Alcohols: C&#8722;O Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The CBG aluminium&#8208;dihydride (I) is used as a catalyst for reducing esters with good tolerance of reducible functionalities. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that compound I catalyzed the hydroboration of epoxides into Markovnikov&#8208;branched products. The earth&#8208;abundant, non&#8208;toxic, and inexpensive Al&#8208;based catalysts are attractive and alternatives to expensive transition and lanthanide&#8208;based metal catalysts.







Abstract
In this work, the molecular aluminium dihydride complex bearing an N, N&#8217;&#8208;chelated conjugated bis&#8208;guanidinate (CBG) ligand is used as a catalyst for reducing a wide range of aryl and alkyl esters with good tolerance of alkene (C=C), alkyne (C&#8801;C), halides (Cl, Br, I and F), nitrile (C&#8801;N), and nitro (NO2) functionalities. Further, we investigated the catalytic application of aluminium dihydride in the C&#8722;O bond cleavage of alkyl and aryl epoxides into corresponding branched Markovnikov ring&#8208;opening products. In addition, the chemoselective intermolecular reduction of esters over other reducible functional groups, such as amides and alkenes, has been established. Intermediates are isolated and characterized by NMR and HRMS studies, which confirm the probable catalytic cycles for the hydroboration of esters and epoxides.

         <title>Hyperbranched Diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based Polymers Constructed via Linear Side&#8208;Chains towards Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conjugated polymers with high charge mobilities have drawn increasing attention in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) in recent years. However, OFETs of conjugated polymers with high mobility and good device stability remain a challenge. In this article, we report a hyperbranched polymer approach to improve the charge mobility and device stability. Three hyperbranched diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based polymers were designed and synthesized via linear alkyl side&#8208;chain linkers. The results show that 2D topological hyperbranched polymers form stable thin film microstructures, and thus improve the device stability, since the conjugated moiety is interconnected by linear alkyl chain. Besides, the incorporation of linear alkyl chain instead of branching alkyl one reduce steric hindrance, and improve the microstructure ordering as well as the charge mobility. Bar&#8208;coated OFETs result demonstrates that the devices mobilities and operational stabilities (bias stability and bending resistance) are both improved. All these indicate that hyperbranched polymer is a potential candidate for future application.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report herein the palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclizative borylation of allenyl ketones with diboron compounds which involves the carbene boryl migratory insertion as the key step. This reaction features mild conditions, good functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope. Thus, it represents an efficient methodology for the assembly of diverse tri&#8208;substituted furyl boronates. In addition, a series of transformations of the resulting multi&#8208;substituted furyl boronates were conducted to provide various densely substituted furan derivatives in good yields, further illustrating the potential synthetic utility of this methodology.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Polyanion&#8208;type Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7) (NFPP) is a promising cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries due to its low cost and high safety. Herein, a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) holey graphene (HG) decorated NFPP/C material (NFPPCHG) has been successfully prepared by a simple and scalable ball milling strategy with sodium phytate and ferrous oxalate as precursors. The introduction of HG can obviously improve the specific surface area, electronic conductivity and ions transport performance of NFPPCHG, and largely enhance its electrochemical properties. The prepared NFPPCHG delivers a high reversible capacity of 118 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.2 C and keeps a considerable capacity of 53 mAh g&#8208;1 even at an ultrahigh rate of 100 C. NFPPCHG also shows excellent performance at 55 &#176;C and &#8208;20 &#176;C. Moreover, in&#8208;situ distribution of relaxation time analysis further demonstrates NFPPCHG has superior electrochemical kinetics. In addition, HC//NFPPCHG full cell displays good performance, suggesting great potential of the prepared material for practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>B(C6F5)3&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective Ring Opening of Cyclic Amines with Hydrosilanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Opening the ring of cyclic amines by regioselective fisson of one of the carbon&#8211;nitrogen bonds greatly expands the repertoire of available nitrogen&#8208;containing skeletons. Unlike approaches starting from cyclic tertiary amines, methods that can directly open secondary amines are still scarce. The present work discloses an efficient reductive ring opening of either of these cyclic amines using PhSiH3 under B(C6F5)3 catalysis. By this, the direct transformation of unstrained cyclic amines into the corresponding acyclic amines is achieved in a simple one&#8208;pot operation. A stepwise mechanism proceeding through the intermediacy of silylammonium ions followed by reductive cleavage of a carbon&#8211;nitrogen bond was experimentally verified.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective methionine labelling of recombinant Trastuzumab shows high in vitro and in vivo tumour targeting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly effective 2&#8208;step system for site&#8208;specific antibody modification and conjugation of the monoclonal antibody Herceptin (commercially available under Trastuzumab) in a cysteine&#8208;independent manner was used to generate labelled antibodies for in vivo imaging. The first step contains redox&#8208;activated chemical tagging (ReACT) of thioethers via engineered methionine residues to introduce specific alkyne moieties, thereby offering a novel easy way to fundamentally change the process of antibody bioconjugation. The second step involves modification of the introduced alkyne via azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition 'click' conjugation. The versatility of this 2&#8208;step approach is demonstrated here by the selective incorporation of a fluorescent dye but can also be applied to a wide variety of different conjugation partners depending on the desired application in a facile manner. Methionine&#8208;modified antibodies were characterised in vitro, and the diagnostic potential of the most promising variant was further analysed in an in vivo xenograft animal model using a fluorescence imaging modality. This study demonstrates how methionine&#8208;mediated antibody conjugation offers an orthogonal and versatile route to the generation of tailored antibody conjugates with in vivo applicability.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Isomeric Tb3+&#8211;Phthalocyanine Double&#8211;Decker Complexes Depending on the Difference in the Direction of Coordination Plane and Their Magnetic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A C4 h  symmetric swastika phthalocyanine, 1,8,15,22&#8208;tertrakis(2,4&#8208;dimethylpent&#8208;3&#8208;oxy)phthalocyanine (H2TdMPPc), was employed to synthesize Tb3+&#8208;phthalocyanine double&#8208;decker complexes ([Tb(TdMPPc)2]s). Because H2TdMPPc has C4 h  symmetry, (S, S), (R, R), and meso isomers of [Tb(TdMPPc)2] were obtained depending on the difference in the direction of the coordination plane of two C4 h &#8208;type phthalocyanines with respect to a central Tb3+ ion. We investigated the physical properties of these [Tb(TdMPPc)2] isomers, including their single&#8208;ion magnetic properties, and found that the spin&#8208;reversal energy barrier (Ueff) of the meso isomer was apparently higher than that of the enantiomer. Detailed crystal structural analyses indicated that the meso isomer has a more symmetrical structure than do the enantiomers, thereby suggesting that the higher Ueff of the meso isomer originated from the higher symmetrical structure.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of the Redox Non&#8208;Innocent Hydroxyl Ligand in the Activation of O2 Performed by [Ni(H)(OH)]+</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cationic complex [Ni(H)(OH)]+ was previously found to activate dioxygen and methane in gas phase under single collision conditions. These remarkable reactivities were thought to originate from a non&#8208;classical electronic structure, where the Ni&#8208;centre adopts a Ni(II), instead of the classically expected Ni(III) oxidation state by formally accepting an electron from the hydroxo ligand, which formally becomes a hydroxyl radical in the process. Such radicaloid oxygen moieties are envisioned to easily react with otherwise inert substrates, mimicking familiar reactivities of free radicals. In this study, the reductive activation of dioxygen by [Ni(H)(OH)]+ to afford the hydroperoxo species was investigated using coupled cluster, multireference ab initio and density functional theory calculations. Orbital and wave function analyses indicate that O2 binding tranforms the aforementioned non&#8208;classical electronic structure to a classical Ni(III)&#8208;hydroxyl system, before O2 reduction takes place. Remarkably, we found no evidence for a direct involvement of the radicaloid hydroxyl in the reaction with O2, as is often assumed. The function of the redox non&#8208;innocent character of the activator complex is to protect the reactive electronic structure until the complex engages O2, upon which a dramatic electronic reorganization releases internal energy and drives the chemical reaction to completion.</dc:description>

         <title>Distance&#8208;Triggered Distinct Aryl Migrations on Azidodiboranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Derived from structurally similar precursors, two different azidodiboranes went through distinct aryl migration reactions triggered by different boron&#8208;boron separation distances. Biphenylene based diborane with a shorter boron&#8208;boron distance underwent heterolateral aryl migration to form a seven&#8208;membered azadiborepin, while xanthrene based diborane with a longer boron&#8208;boron distance afforded a stable bis&#8208;azidoborane scaffold. The pyrolysis of such a bis&#8208;azidoborane led to eight&#8208;membered oxazadiborocine through homolateral aryl migration and subsequent [3+2] cycloaddition. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations unveiled that the boron&#8208;boron separation distances were the intrinsic factors for the distinct migrations.</dc:description>

         <title>Buried Interface Regulation by Bio&#8208;Functional Molecules for Efficient and Stable Planar Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Among the factors that lead to the reduction of the efficiency of perovskite solar cell (PSCs), is the difficulty involved in realizing a high&#8208;quality film and the efficient charge transfer that take place at the interface between electron&#8208;transport layer (ETL) and perovskite. Here, we demonstrated a strategy for planar&#8208;type devices by natural bio&#8208;functional interfaces that uses a buried electron&#8208;transport layer made of cobalamin complexed tin oxide (SnO2@B12). As systematically investigating the effects of SnO2@B12 interfacial layer in perovskite solar cells, cobalamin can chemically link SnO2 layer and perovskite layer, resulting in improved perovskite film quality and interfacial defect passivation. Utilizing SnO2@B12 improves the efficiency of planar&#8208;type PSCs by 20.60 %. Furthermore, after 250 hours of exposure to an ambient atmosphere, unsealed PSCs containing SnO2@B12 degrade by 10%. This research provides a viable method for developing bio&#8208;functional molecules that will increase the effectiveness and durability of planar&#8208;perovskite solar cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Post&#8208;Functionalization and Properties of Diphosphapentaarenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shortening the core. Diphosphapentaarenes, the shorter analogs of diphosphahexaarenes, are stable linearly fused systems containing two six&#8208;membered phosphorus heterocycles. They are fluorescent and their phosphorus atoms can be readily post&#8208;functionalized to modify their optoelectronic properties.







Abstract
Linearly&#8208;fused polyarenes are an important class of compounds with high relevance in materials science. While modifying the shape and size represents a common means to fine&#8208;tune their properties, the precise placement of heteroatoms is a strategy that is receiving an increasing deal of attention to overcome the intrinsic limitations of all&#8208;carbon structures. Thus, linearly&#8208;fused diphosphaarenes recently emerged as a novel family of molecules with striking optoelectronic properties and outstanding stability. However, the properties of diphosphaarenes are far from being benchmarked. Herein, we report the synthesis, phosphorus post&#8208;functionalization and properties of new diphosphapentaarene derivatives. We describe their synthetic limitations and unveil their potential for optoelectronic applications.

Thus, linearly-fused diphosphaarenes recently emerged as a novel family of molecules with striking optoelectronic properties and outstanding stability. However, the properties of diphosphaarenes are far from being benchmarked. Herein, we report the synthesis, phosphorus post-functionalization and properties of new diphosphapentaarene derivatives. We describe their synthetic limitations and unveil their potential for optoelectronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Cytotoxic Molybdenocenes with Strong Metabolic Effects Inhibit Tumour Growth in Mice</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of molybdenocenes containing lipophilic substituted Cp ligands as well as bioactive chelating ligands have shown cytotoxicity against lung, colon and ovarian cancer in&#8197;vitro; one complex showed the greatest anticancer activity of any Mo&#8208;based agent known to date. Significant tumour growth inhibition was observed in in&#8197;vivo studies while proteomics showed the most active compound had a strong effect on cellular metabolic processes.







Abstract
A series of six highly lipophilic Cp&#8208;substituted molybdenocenes bearing different bioactive chelating ligands was synthesized and characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and X&#8208;ray crystallography. In vitro experiments showed a greatly increased cytotoxic potency when compared to the non&#8208;Cp&#8208;substituted counterparts. In vivo experiments performed with the dichlorido precursor, (Ph2C&#8722;Cp)2MoCl2 and the in&#8197;vitro most active complex, containing the thioflavone ligand, showed an inhibition of tumour growth. Proteomic studies on the same two compounds demonstrated a significant regulation of tubulin&#8208;associated and mitochondrial inner membrane proteins for both compounds and a strong metabolic effect of the thioflavone containing complex.

         <title>The HD Reaction of Nitrogenase: a Detailed Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed mechanism is presented for the reaction D +2H++2e&#8722;&#8594;2HD of the enzyme nitrogenase, developed with density functional simulations of a 486&#8208;atom model of the active site FeMo&#8208;co and surrounding protein. It explains the accumulated experimental data and connects with the enigmatic N2&#8594;NH3 reaction of the enzyme.







Abstract
Nitrogenase is the enzyme that converts N2 to NH3 under ambient conditions. The chemical mechanism of this catalysis at the active site FeMo&#8208;co [Fe7S9CMo(homocitrate)] is unknown. An obligatory co&#8208;product is H2, while exogenous H2 is a competitive inhibitor. Isotopic substitution using exogenous D2 revealed the N2&#8208;dependent reaction D2+2H++2e&#8722;&#8594;2HD (the &#8216;HD reaction&#8217;), together with a collection of additional experimental characteristics and requirements. This paper describes a detailed mechanism for the HD reaction, developed and elaborated using density functional simulations with a 486&#8208;atom model of the active site and surrounding protein. First D2 binds at one Fe atom (endo&#8208;Fe6 coordination position), where it is flanked by H&#8722;Fe6 (exo position) and H&#8722;Fe2 (endo position). Then there is synchronous transfer of these two H atoms to bound D2, forming one HD bound to Fe2 and a second HD bound to Fe6. These two HD dissociate sequentially. The final phase is recovery of the two flanking H atoms. These H atoms are generated, sequentially, by translocation of a proton from the protein surface to S3B of FeMo&#8208;co and combination with introduced electrons. The first H atom migrates from S3B to exo&#8208;Fe6 and the second from S3B to endo&#8208;Fe2. Reaction energies and kinetic barriers are reported for all steps. This mechanism accounts for the experimental data: (a)&#8197;stoichiometry; (b)&#8197;the N2&#8208;dependence results from promotional N2 bound at exo&#8208;Fe2; (c)&#8197;different N2 binding Km for the HD reaction and the NH3 formation reaction results from involvement of two different sites; (d)&#8197;inhibition by CO; (e)&#8197;the non&#8208;occurrence of 2HD&#8594;H2+D2 results from the synchronicity of the two transfers of H to D2; (f)&#8197;inhibition of HD production at high pN2 is by competitive binding of N2 at endo&#8208;Fe6; (g)&#8197;the non&#8208;leakage of D to solvent follows from the hydrophobic environment and irreversibility of proton introduction.

         <title>Lysosomal Targeting of &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin</title>

Cyclodextrins. Attachment of a bis&#8208;mannose&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate terminated glycan to &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin increases both cellular internalisation and transport to the lysosome, indicating potential application for improved treatments for lysosomal metabolite accumulation







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD) and derivatives are approved therapeutics in &gt;30 clinical settings. &#946;&#8208;CDs have also shown promise as therapeutics for treatment of some lysosomal storage disorders, such as Niemann&#8208;Pick disease type C, and other disease states which involve metabolite accumulation in the lysosome. In these cases, &#946;&#8208;CD activity relies on transport to the lysosome, wherein it can bind hydrophobic substrate and effect extraction. The post&#8208;translational attachment of N&#8208;glycans terminated in mannose&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate (M6P) residues is the predominant method by which lysosomal enzymes are targeted to the lysosome. In this work we covalently attach a synthetic biantennary bis&#8208;M6P&#8208;terminated N&#8208;glycan to &#946;&#8208;CD and study the effect of the added glycans in a mammalian cell line. The formation of a host guest complex with a Cy5 fluorophore allows study of both cellular internalisation and transport to the lysosome by fluorescence microscopy. Results indicate that the rates of both internalisation and lysosomal transport are increased by the attachment of M6P&#8208;glycans to &#946;&#8208;CD, indicating that M6P&#8208;glycan conjugation may improve the therapeutic effectiveness of &#946;&#8208;CD for the treatment of disorders involving hydrophobic metabolite accumulation in the lysosome.

         <title>Advanced Covalent Organic Frameworks for Multi&#8208;Valent Metal Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer an opportunity for complex structural design and specific functional development, facilitating, for example, the applications of multi&#8208;valent metal ion batteries (Zn2+, Mg2+, Al3+). This comprehensive review describes COF synthesis and applications, provides advances in topology design and synthetic reactions, surveys the application of COFs in multi&#8208;valent ion batteries, discusses the key issues of COF electrodes, and predicts future applications.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have received increased interest in recent years as an advanced class of materials. By virtue of the available monomers, multiple conformations and various linkages, COFs offer a wide range of opportunities for complex structural design and specific functional development of materials, which has facilitated the widespread application in many fields, including multi&#8208;valent metal ion batteries (MVMIBs), described as the attractive candidate replacing lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). With their robust skeletons, diverse pores, flexible structures and abundant functional groups, COFs are expected to help realize a high performance MVMIBs. In this review, we present an overview of COFs, describe advances in topology design and synthetic reactions, and study the application of COFs in MVMIBs, as well as discuss challenges and solutions in the preparation of COFs electrodes, in the hope of providing constructive insights into the future direction of COFs.

         <title>Water&#8208;Triggered Chemical Transformation of Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;triggered interfacial chemistry shows promising advantage for morphology, shape and composition control towards formation of new bio&#8208;compatible perovskite nanocrystals. In this Review, the recent development of this unique approach at the water&#8211;hexane interface that may be extended to tailor not only CsPbX3 but also perovskite nanocrystals beyond this family is summarized.







Abstract
Recently emerged lead&#8208;halide perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) are promising optoelectronic material due to their easy solution processability, wide range of color tunability, as well as very high photoluminescence quantum yield. Despite their significant success in lab&#8208;scale optoelectronic applications, the long&#8208;term stability becomes the main issue, hindering them towards commercialization. The highly ionic nature of such lead&#8208;halide structure makes them extremely unstable in water and air. But a very few groups have taken the advantage of such nature of the crystal structure for water&#8208;triggered chemical transformation towards shape, composition, and morphology controlled stable and bright PNCs, which are otherwise difficult to obtain by typical direct approach. Furthermore, using polymer as an encapsulating layer for the PNCs, water&#8208;soluble stable PNCs have been prepared. In this review, the recent progress on the water&#8211;hexane interface chemistry towards chemical transformation to produce several PNCs is described. Such method not only ensure to yield several shape&#8208;controlled perovskites nanocrystals, but also formation of perovskites in aqueous phase that show promising application towards bio&#8208;imaging.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Luminescent Materials with Multiple Emission Colors and Near&#8208;Unity Quantum Yield</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward heat&#8208;treatment strategy is proposed to load 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride into the matrix of boric acid to produce powders with a near&#8208;unity quantum yield and tunable emission color from yellow to green. The confinement effect of boric acid is responsible for the high emission efficiency of products.







Abstract
Developing solid luminescent materials with a unity quantum yield and tunable emission color is promising, although it is still a difficult task. A straightforward heat&#8208;treatment method has been developed to load 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) into the matrix of boric acid (BA) to produce powders with a near&#8208;unity quantum yield and tunable emission color from yellow to green. Our results suggest that the emission of the powders originates from PTCDA, and the tunability of the emission color is caused by the hydrolysis of PTCDA in the alkaline environment. The near&#8208;unity quantum yield is attributed to the BA matrix, which confines PTCDA. In addition, the powder also shows excellent thermal stability that allows its application in light&#8208;emitting diodes. The above results are important for the development of solid&#8208;state luminescent materials for various applications, and also provide a clue for studying the emission properties of luminescent materials.

         <title>Coordination of Pnictogenylboranes Towards Tl(I) Salts and a Tl&#8208; Mediated P&#8722;P Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions of NMe3&#8208;stabilized pnictogenylboranes with Tl(I) salts of weakly coordinating anions led to rare examples of Tl coordination compounds [Tl(EH2BH2&#8901;NMe3)n]+ (n=1, 3; E=P, As) featuring mono and threefold coordination of pnictogenylboranes. In addition, by using CH2Cl2 as a solvent, an unprecedented, Tl&#8208;promoted P&#8722;P coupling was observed, leading to [Me3N&#8901;BH2PH2&#8208;PHBH2&#8901;NMe3]+. During these investigations, novel Tl[WCA] salts were prepared and the synthesis of EH2BH2&#8901;NMe3 was improved towards greater accessibility.







Abstract
The coordination chemistry of only Lewis&#8208;base (LB)&#8208;stabilized pnictogenylboranes EH2BH2&#8901;NMe3 (E=P, As) towards Tl(I) salts has been studied. The reaction of Tl[BArCl] (BArCl=[B(3,5&#8208;C6H3Cl2)4]&#8722;) with the corresponding pnictogenylborane results in the formation of [Tl(EH2BH2&#8901;NMe3)][BArCl] (1&#8201;a: E=P; 1&#8201;b: E=As). Whereas the Tl ion in 1&#8201;a/b is monocoordinated, the exchange of the weakly coordinating anion (WCA) in the Tl(I) salt leads to the formation of a trigonal pyramidal coordination mode at the Tl atom by coordination of three equivalents of EH2BH2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;NMe3 in [Tl(EH2BH2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;NMe3)3][WCA] (2&#8201;a: E=P, WCA=TEFCl; 2&#8201;b: E=As, WCA=TEF) (TEF=[Al{OC(CF3)3}4]&#8722;, TEFCl=[Al{(OC(CF3)2(CCl3)}4]&#8722;). Furthermore, by using two equivalents of PH2BH2&#8901;NMe3, a Tl(I)&#8208;mediated P&#8722;P coupling takes place in CH2Cl2 as solvent resulting in [Me3N&#8901;BH2PH2PHBH2&#8901;NMe3][WCA] (WCA=TEF, 3&#8201;a; BArCl, 3&#8201;b; TEFCl, 3&#8201;c). In contrast, for the arsenic derivatives 1&#8201;b and 2&#8201;b, no coupling reaction is observed. The underlying chemical processes are elucidated by quantum chemical computations.

         <title>Dioxygen Splitting by a Tantalum(V) Complex Ligated by a Rigid, Redox Non&#8208;Innocent Pincer Ligand
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a tantalum(V) dichloride complex ligated by a rigid and redox non&#8208;innocent pincer ligand is reported. Cyclic voltammetry and derivatization reactions show that up to two electrons can be transferred from the ligand to the metal. Exposing this complex to O2 leads to the formation of an oxygen bridged dinuclear complex resulting from the full reduction of O2 to O2&#8722;.







Abstract
The reaction of TaMe3Cl2 with the rigid acridane&#8208;derived trisamine H3NNN yields the tantalum(V) complex [TaCl2(NNNcat)]. Subsequent reaction with dioxygen results in the full four&#8208;electron reduction of O2 yielding the oxido&#8208;bridged bimetallic complex [{TaCl2(NNNsq)}2O]. This dinuclear complex features an open&#8208;shell ground state due to partial ligand oxidation and was comprehensively characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, LIFDI mass spectrometry, NMR, EPR, IR and UV/VIS/NIR spectroscopy. The mechanism of O2 activation was investigated by DFT calculations revealing initial binding of O2 to the tantalum(V) center followed by complete O2 scission to produce a terminal oxido&#8208;complex.

         <dc:description>We herein report the design and scalable synthesis of three new Co(III) complexes, which have an unusual hydrocarbon &#951; 1 &#8208;alkyl&#8208; &#951; 3 &#8208;allyl&#8208; &#951; 5 &#8208;cyclopentadienyl ligation structure, from the reactions of readily available cobalt(II) compound CoCl 2 (PPh 3 ) 2 and biomass material &#946; &#8208;pinene via C&#8211;C bond activation. These Co(III) complexes are air&#8208;stable, fairly volatile, and thermally stable, so they are excellent candidates as the metal precursors for the vapour deposition of cobalt&#8208;containing thin films. As a demonstration, we show that the Co(III) complex of [(3&#8217;&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208; &#951; ,1&#8208; &#963; )&#8208;methylene(2,2,4&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;cyclohexene&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyl)]( &#951; 5 &#8208;methylcyclopentadienyl)Co (i.e. ( seco &#8208;pinene)(MeCp)Co) is well suited for the atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Co 3 O 4 thin films, and the deposited Co 3 O 4 film is able to conformally cover trench structures with a fairly high aspect ratio of 10:1.</dc:description>

         <title>X&#8208;ray Triggered Coordination Bond Breakage in Dysprosium&#8208;organic Framework and Its Impact on Magnetic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photosensitive lanthanide&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule magnets (Ln&#8208;SMM) are very attractive for their potential applications in information storage, switching, and sensors. However, the light&#8208;driven structural transformation in Ln&#8208;SMMs hardly changes the coordination number of the lanthanide ion. Herein we report for the first time that X&#8208;ray (&#955; = 0.71073 &#197;) irradiation can break the coordination bond of Dy&#8208;OH2 in the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) metal&#8208;organic framework
Dy2(amp2H2)3(H2O)6&#8729;4H2O (MDAF&#8208;5), where the {Dy2(OPO)2} dimers are crosslinked by dianthracene&#8208;phosphonate ligands. The structural transformation proceeds in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SC&#8208;SC) fashion, forming the new phase Dy2(amp2H2)3(H2O)4&#8729;4H2O (MDAF&#8208;5X). The phase transition is accompanied by a significant change in magnetic properties due to the alteration in coordination geometry of the DyIII ion from a distorted pentagonal bipyramid in MDAF&#8208;5 to a distorted octahedron in MDAF&#8208;5&#8208;X.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of TiO2/SrTiO3 Heterojunction Derived from Monolayer Ti3C2 MXene for Efficient Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Construction of heterojunction at the atomic scale to ensure efficient charge separation for improvement of photocatalytic water splitting is challenging. Herein, a facile hydrothermal method has been applied for the in&#8208;situ fabrication of TiO2/SrTiO3&#160;heterojunction, using the monolayer Ti3C2&#160;MXene as the template and reactant. It is found that the sample with the hydrothermal reaction time of 60 min exhibits the highest H2 evolution rate with the sacrificial reagents, due to the efficient charge separation of TiO2/SrTiO3 heterojunction as Ti3C2 derivative. In addition, the sample shows the best overall water splitting performance at a hydrothermal reaction time of 120 min, where TiO2 is nearly converted to SrTiO3, due to the fast kinetic process and low structural defects of SrTiO3. This work not only provides a simple strategy for the&#160;fabrication of heterojunction photocatalysts but also demonstrates the difference in optimization of half&#8208;reaction and overall water splitting reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoredox Catalyzed Single C&#8211;F Bond Activation of Trifluoromethyl Ketones: A Solvent Controlled Divergent Access of gem&#8208;Difluoromethylene Containing Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective defluorinative functionalization of trifluoromethyl ketones is a long&#8208;standing challenge owing to the exhaustive mode of the process. To meet the demands for the installation of the gem&#8208;difluoromethylene unit for the construction of the molecular architectures of well&#8208;known pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, a distinct pathway is thereby highly desirable. Here, we introduce a protocol that allows the divergent synthesis of gem&#8208;difluoromethylene group containing tetrahydrofuran derivatives and linear ketones via single C&#8211;F bond activation of trifluoromethyl ketones using visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis in the presence of suitable olefins as trapping partner. The choice of appropriate solvent and catalyst plays a significant role in controlling the divergent behavior of this protocol. Highly reducing photo&#8208;excited catalysts are found to be responsible for the generation of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoromethyl ketone (DFMK) radicals as the key intermediate via a SET process. This protocol also results in a high diastereoselectivity towards the formation of partially fluorinated cyclic ketal derivatives with simultaneous construction of one C&#8211;C and two C&#8211;O bonds. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art DFT calculations are performed to address the origin of diastereoselectivity as well as the divergence of this protocol.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of a Bifunctionalized Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) Anchor Useful for the Study of GPI Biology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new, bifunctional glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) derivative containing the highly conserved core structure of all natural GPI anchors with a photoactivable diazirine in the lipid chain and clickable alkynes in the glycan was synthesized by a convergent [3 + 2] glycosylation strategy with late stage protecting group manipulation and regioselective phosphorylation. The challenges of this synthesis were due to the presence of several distinctive functional groups in the synthetic target, which complicated the protection tactics, in addition to the inherent difficulties associated with GPI synthesis. This bifunctional GPI derivative can cross&#8208;react with molecules in proximity upon photoactivation and be subsequently labeled with other molecular tags via click reaction. Therefore, it should be a valuable probe for biological studies of GPIs, such as analysis of GPI&#8208;interacting membrane proteins, and gaining insights into their functional mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Long&#8208;Acting Insulin&#8208;Zwitterionic Polymer Conjugate Mitigates Hypoglycemia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Insulin, a main medication to control glycemia of type 1 and advanced type 2 diabetes, faces problems of the short half&#8208;life and poor stability during its clinical use. Zwitterionic polymer shows unique properties of antifouling and low immunogenicity. Here, we have synthesized a new insulin&#8208;zwitterionic polymer conjugate (INS&#8208;PMPC) through grafting&#8208;from strategy by controlled radical polymerization. Apart from showing excellent stability upon heat and mechanical agitation, the resulting INS&#8208;PMPC conjugate provided over 20 h of glycemic control due to improved pharmacokinetics in diabetic mice with one single subcutaneous injection. Most importantly, this insulin&#8208;zwitterionic polymer conjugate significantly decreases the incidence of hypoglycemia.</dc:description>

         <title>Revisiting the Reaction of IPr with Tritylium: An Alternative Mechanistic Pathway</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite a recent proposal on the mechanism of a single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) process between tritylium and 2,6&#8208;bis(diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (IPr) based on evidence of transient IPr radical cation intermediate ([IPr]&#9679;+) formation, such oxidation is still contentious because of the high oxidation potential of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes. Our experimental analysis indicates that the appearance of deep purple color, previously considered to be from transient [IPr]&#9679;+, originates from a zwitterionic intermediate (3a), not a radical cation. Here, we propose an alternative mechanism for the reaction involving tritylium and IPr. This mechanism is noteworthy for explaining how [NHC&#8211;H]+ can be generated without the formation of transient [NHC]&#9679;+, which has been frequently proposed as an intermediate for the reaction between NHC and oxidants. These results also show that a transient strong single&#8208;electron donor (3a) could be generated by the alternative mechanism for oxidants using NHCs, which is a more feasible explanation for the reactivity of NHCs with oxidants.</dc:description>

         <title>The Buoy Effect: Surface Enrichment of a Pt Complex in IL Solution by Ligand Design</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The targeted enrichment of a Pt complex with an ionic liquid (IL)&#8208;derived ligand system in IL solution is demonstrated using angle&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. When complementing the ligand system with fluorinated side chains, the complex is strongly accumulated at the IL/gas interface, while in an equivalent solution of a complex without these substituents no such effect could be observed. This buoy&#8208;like behavior induces strong population of the complex at the outermost molecular layer close to surface saturation, which was studied over a range from 5%mol to 30%mol. Thereby, the surface enrichment is found to be most efficient at lowest concentration which is particularly favorable for catalytic applications such as supported ionic liquid phase (SILP) catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Disentangling the Effect of Pressure and Mixing on a Mechanochemical Bromination Reaction by Solid&#8208;state NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanical forces, including compressive stresses, have a significant impact on chemical reactions. Besides the preparative opportunities, mechanochemical conditions benefit from the absence of any organic solvent, the possibility of a significant synthetic acceleration and unique reaction pathways. Together with an accurate characterization of ball&#8208;milling products, the development of a deeper mechanistic understanding of the occurring transformations at a molecular level is critical for fully grasping the potential of organic mechanosynthesis. We herein studied a bromination of a cyclic sulfoximine in a mixer mill and used solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy for structural characterization of the reaction products. Magic&#8208;angle spinning (MAS) was applied for elucidating the product mixtures taken from the milling jar without introducing any further post&#8208;processing on the sample. Ex&#8208;situ 13C&#8208;detected NMR spectra of ball&#8208;milling products showed the formation of a rather crystalline solid phase with the regioselective bromination of the S&#8208;aryl group of the heterocycle in position 4. Completion is reached in less than 30 minutes as deduced from the NMR spectra. The bromination can also be achieved by magnetic stirring, but then, a longer reaction time is required. Mixing the solid educts in the NMR rotor allows to get in&#8208;situ insights into the reaction and enables the detection of a reaction intermediate. The pressure alone induced in the rotor by MAS is not sufficient to lead to full conversion and the reaction occurs on slower time scales than in the ball mill, which is crucial for analysing mixtures taken from the milling jar by solid&#8208;state NMR. Our data suggest that on top of centrifugal forces, an efficient mixing of the starting materials is required for reaching a complete reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Optical Manipulation of Gb3 Enriched Lipid Domains: Impact of Isomerization on Gb3&#8208;Shiga Toxin B Interaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switch it on: Gb3 sphingolipids with azobenzene groups serve as light&#8208;triggered nano&#8208;tools to control lipid and protein domains. By using the ability of Gb3 to bind Shiga toxin, its photo&#8208;isomerization alters the protein distribution on liquid&#8208;ordered domains and induces submicrometer&#8208;sized protein lakes. This may offer new strategies for controlling the structure of biological membranes including membrane&#8208;interacting proteins.







Abstract
The plasma membrane is a complex assembly of proteins and lipids that can self&#8208;assemble in submicroscopic domains commonly termed &#8220;lipid rafts&#8221;, which are implicated in membrane signaling and trafficking. Recently, photo&#8208;sensitive lipids were introduced to study membrane domain organization, and photo&#8208;isomerization was shown to trigger the mixing and de&#8208;mixing of liquid&#8208;ordered (lo) domains in artificial phase&#8208;separated membranes. Here, we synthesized globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) glycosphingolipids that harbor an azobenzene moiety at different positions of the fatty acid to investigate light&#8208;induced membrane domain reorganization, and that serve as specific receptors for the protein Shiga toxin (STx). Using phase&#8208;separated supported lipid bilayers on mica surfaces doped with four different photo&#8208;Gb3 molecules, we found by fluorescence microscopy and atomic force microscopy that liquid disordered (ld) domains were formed within lo domains upon trans&#8208;cis photo&#8208;isomerization. The fraction and size of these ld domains were largest for Gb3 molecules with the azobenzene group at the end of the fatty acid. We further investigated the impact of domain reorganization on the interaction of the B&#8208;subunits of STx with the photo&#8208;Gb3. Fluorescence and atomic force micrographs clearly demonstrated that STxB binds to the lo phase if Gb3 is in the trans&#8208;configuration, whereas two STxB populations are formed if the photo&#8208;Gb3 is switched to the cis&#8208;configuration highlighting the idea of manipulating lipid&#8208;protein interactions with a light stimulus.

         <title>Quest for the Most Aromatic Pathway in Charged Expanded Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we show that the search for the most aromatic pathway in charged expanded porphyrins becomes a more puzzling quest than their neutral analogue structures. Among the most popular aromatic indices, AVmin turns out to be the most useful tool seeking the most aromatic path.







Abstract
Despite the central role of aromaticity in the chemistry of expanded porphyrins, the evaluation of aromaticity remains difficult for these extended macrocycles. The presence of multiple conjugation pathways and different planar and nonplanar &#960;&#8208;conjugation topologies makes the quantification of global and local aromaticity even more challenging. In neutral expanded porphyrins, it is established the predominance of the aromatic conjugation pathway passing through the imine&#8208;type nitrogens and circumventing the amino NH groups. However, for charged macrocycles, the question about the main conjugation circuit remains open. Accordingly, different conjugation pathways in a set of neutral, anionic, and cationic expanded porphyrins were investigated by means of several aromaticity indices rooted in the structural, magnetic, and electronic criteria. Overall, our results reveal the predominance of the conjugation pathway that passes through all nitrogen atoms to describe the aromaticity of deprotonated expanded porphyrins, while the outer pathway through the perimeter carbon atoms becomes the most aromatic in protonated macrocycles. In nonplanar and charged macrocycles, a discrepancy between electronic and magnetic descriptors is observed. Nevertheless, our work demonstrates AVmin remains the best tool to determine the main conjugation pathway of expanded porphyrins.

         <dc:description>
The cation&#8208;tuning engineering strategy as a new emerging frontier has attracted significant attention for transition metal&#8208;based catalysts. Its advantages are summarized with special emphasis on altering the electronic structure and charge distribution of transition metal&#8208;based catalysts. This Concept also reviews its application for the oxygen reduction reaction, the oxygen evolution reaction, and Zn air batteries, and also proposes future opportunities.







Abstract
Cation&#8208;tuning engineering has become a new frontier in altering the electronic structure of electrocatalysts, which has been employed to enhance their electrochemical performance. Significant efforts have been made to promote the electrochemical performance of transition metal&#8208;based materials during oxygen electrocatalysis and related energy devices such as Zn&#8208;air batteries. Herein, the advantages of cation&#8208;tuning engineering, including cation vacancies/defects and cation doping, in the modification of the electronic structure of transition metal oxide catalysts are discussed. Additionally, practical applications of the cation&#8208;tuning engineering strategy are reviewed in detail with a special emphasis on oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. Lastly, challenges and future opportunities in this field are also proposed.

         <title>Recyclable GO&#8208;Arginine Hybrids for CO2 Fixation into Cyclic Carbonates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO2 fix: A new covalently modified graphene&#8722;arginine oxide has been synthesized on a gram&#8208;scale, spectroscopically characterized and effectively used for CO2 fixation and transformation into cyclic carbonates. Dedicated control experiments led to a full rationale of the reaction profile.







Abstract
New covalently modified GO&#8208;guanidine materials have been realized in a gram&#8208;scale synthesis and purified by an innovative microfiltration. The use of these composites in the fixation of CO2 into cyclic carbonates is demonstrated. Mild operating conditions, high yields (up to 85&#8201;%), wide scope (15 examples) and recoverability/reusability (up to 5 cycles) of the material account for the efficiency of the protocol. Dedicated control experiments shed light on the activation modes exerted by GO&#8208;l&#8208;arginine during the ring&#8208;opening/closing synthetic sequence.

         <title>A Small&#8208;Molecule Probe with a Dual Function of miRNA Inhibition and Target identification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;molecule probe derived from norathyriol with a dual function of miRNA inhibition and target identification was developed. In combination with bioorthogonal click chemistry, we identified AGO2 as the target of this probe.







Abstract
By virtue of their key roles in pathologies, miRNAs represent a promising class of therapeutic targets. While high&#8208;fidelity small&#8208;molecule modulators of miRNAs can be identified via high&#8208;throughput screening using cellular reporter systems, their modes of action are elusive due to the lack of proper tools. Here, we report a small&#8208;molecule probe, 1&#8201;a, that is capable of elucidating its biological target along miRNA inhibition. Derived from norathyriol, a nature product, 1&#8201;a possessed a bioorthogonal alkyne moiety for subsequent labeling via copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition chemistry. We demonstrated that 1&#8201;a inhibited a panel of different miRNAs by blocking their loading onto argonaute 2 (AGO2), which is the key protein responsible for miRNA function. With the alkyne handle, we successfully identified AGO2 as an intracellular target of 1&#8201;a. Therefore, this work presents a novel small&#8208;molecule tool for suppressing and probing miRNA regulatory pathways.

         <title>A Hydride&#8208;Substituted Homoleptic Silylborate: How Similar is it to its Diborane(6)&#8208;Dianion Isostere?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 1,2&#8208;dihydride&#8208;substituted silylborate was synthesized via an &#8220;Umpolung&#8221; approach using a chlorosilane and a boron&#8208;centered nucleophile. Except for the B&#8722;Si vs. B&#8722;B cores, the silylborate is identical to a prominent diborane(6) dianion, allowing a direct comparison of their reactivities after H&#8722; abstraction. The resulting B(&#956;&#8208;H)E product is isolable for E=B, but constitutes a (still synthetically useful) transient intermediate for E=Si.







Abstract
The B&#8208;nucleophilic 9H&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorene dianion reacts with 9&#8208;chloro&#8208;9&#8208;silafluorene to afford air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable silylborate salts M[Ar2(H)B&#8722;Si(H)Ar2] (M[HBSiH], M=Li, Na). Li[HBSiH] and Me3SiCl give the B&#8722;pyridine adduct Ar2(py)B&#8722;Si(H)Ar2 ((py)BSiH) or the chlorosilane Li[Ar2(H)B&#8722;Si(Cl)Ar2] (Li[HBSiCl]) in C6H6&#8208;pyridine or THF. In both cases, the first step is H&#8722; abstraction at the B center. The resulting free borane subsequently binds a py or thf ligand. While the py adduct is stable at room temperature, the thf adduct undergoes a 1,2&#8208;H shift via the cyclic B(&#956;&#8208;H)Si intermediate BHSi, which is afterwards attacked at the Si atom by a Cl&#8722; ion to give Li[HBSiCl]. DFT calculations were employed to support the proposed reaction mechanism and to characterize the electronic structure of BHSi. Treatment of Li[HBSiCl] with the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene IMe introduces the neutral donor at the Si atom and leads to Ar2(H)B&#8722;Si(IMe)Ar2 (HBSi(IMe)), a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;stabilized silylene.

         <title>Near&#8208;infrared Emissive Hypervalent Compounds with Germanium(IV)&#8208;Fused Azobenzene &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel molecular design for showing near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission is still required for satisfying growing demands for NIR&#8208;light technology. In this research, we discover hypervalent compounds with germanium(Ge)&#8208;fused azobenzene (GAz) scaffolds can exhibit NIR emission (&#955;PL = 690~721 nm, &#934;PL = 0.03~0.04) despite compact &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. The unique optical properties are derived from trigonal bipyramidal geometry of the hypervalent compounds constructed by combination of Ge and azobenzene&#8208;based tridentate ligands. Experimental and theoretical calculation results disclose that germanium&#8211;nitrogen (Ge&#8722;N) coordination at the equatorial position strongly reduces the energy level of LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital), and the three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron (3c&#8208;4e) bond in the apical position effectively rises the energy level of HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital). It is emphasized that large narrowing of the HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap is achieved just by forming the hypervalent bond. In addition, the narrow&#8208;energy&#8208;gap property can be enhanced by extension of &#960;&#8208;conjugation. The obtained &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer shows efficient NIR emission both in solution (&#955;PL = 770 nm and &#934;PL = 0.10) and film (&#955;PL = 807 nm and &#934;PL = 0.04). These results suggest that collaboration of a hypervalent bond and a &#960;&#8208;conjugated system is a novel and effective strategy for tuning electronic properties even in the NIR region.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution by a De Novo Designed Metalloprotein that Undergoes Ni&#8208;Mediated Oligomerization Shift</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>De novo metalloprotein design involves the construction of proteins guided by specific repeat patterns of polar and apolar residues, which, upon self&#8208;assembly, provides a suitable environment to bind metals and produce artificial metalloenzymes. While a wide range of functionalities have been realized in de novo designed metalloproteins, the functional repertoire of such constructs towards alternative energy&#8208;relevant catalysis is currently limited. Here we show the application of de novo approach to design a functional H2 evolving protein. The design involved the assembly of an amphiphilic peptide featuring cysteines at tandem a/d sites of each helix. Intriguingly, upon NiII addition, the oligomers shift from a major trimeric assembly to a mix of dimers and trimers. The metalloprotein produced H2 photocatalytically with a bell&#8208;shape pH dependence, having a maximum activity at pH 5.5. Transient absorption spectroscopy is used to determine the timescales of electron transfer as a function of pH. Selective outer sphere mutations are made to probe how the local environment tunes activity. A preferential enhancement of activity is observed via steric modulation above the NiII site, towards the N&#8208;termini, compared to below the NiII site towards the C&#8208;termini.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To meet the need of high energy density, long durability, safe and cost&#8208;efficient energy conversion and storage devices, metal&#8208;air batteries like Li&#8208;O  2  &#160;and Zn&#8208;O  2  &#160;batteries have received enormous attentions and made exciting developments in the past decade. Photo&#8208;assisted strategies that enable the effective combination of photo/electric energy conversion/storage render a new dimension for the conventional metal&#8208;air batteries techniques with mere electric energy utilization. Therefor, tremendous research is ongoing in search for more efficient and durable devices with photo&#8208;assisted strategies. This review provides an overview of photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O  2  &#160;batteries, Zn&#8208;O  2  &#160;batteries, and batteries with various metal/air components. The working mechanism, the basic device architecture and practical performances of various photo&#8208;assisted systems are summarized and discussed. Furthermore, certain technical challenges and future opportunities for the photo&#8208;assisted metal air batteries&#160;are emphasized and discussed&#160;with the hope of stimulating further researches.</dc:description>

         <title>A Foldable Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Battery Using Gear&#8208;Structured Composite as Freestanding Cathode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A foldable battery with high flexibility provides a great potential in various wearable electronic devices in health and fitness tracking, chronic disease management, performance monitoring, navigation tracking, and portable gears for soldiers. We report a highly flexible, self&#8208;healing Zn&#8208;ion battery by using a free&#8208;standing cathode that is composed of a 3D gear&#8208;like NH4V4O10@C composite on carbon paper. The battery remained a capacity up to 102.4 mAh g&#8208;1&#160;even after folding 60 times with a high angle of 180&#176;. An aqueous hydrogel consisting polyvinyl alcohol, glycerin and Zn(CF3SO3)2&#160;was used as electrolyte, which showed as high as&#160;580% tensile strain under a loading weight of 78 N.&#160;The battery exhibited a better capacity retention of over&#160;100 mAh g&#8208;1and Coulombic efficiency of over 99.8%&#160;after cutting and twisting&#160;to 90&#176;, indicating&#160;a great self&#8208;healing performance. The gear&#8208;like geometry largely improved the volume accommodation due to the increased interval space between the blades and the outwards configuration. While the Zn2+&#160;ionic conductivity was improved due to rapid re&#8208;binding of plenty of existing hydroxyl groups from electrolyte and the enhanced contact surface area and diffusion route from the cathode material. The highly flexible, safe aqueous Zn&#8208;ion battery opens a practical way in powering various carry&#8208;on electronics under mechanical agitations.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Triptycene Annulation on the Photochromism of Diphenylnaphthopyrans: Entropic Control of Thermal Reversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regioisomeric naphthopyrans annulated with triptycene, i.e.,  Prox&#8208;NP  and  Dist&#8208;NP  , display divergent photochromic behaviors. While steady&#8208;state photolysis of  Dist&#8208;NP  led to a very labile colored intermediate that is not observable at rt,  Prox&#8208;NP  yielded a remarkably stable species characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography as the TT&#173; isomer of  o  &#8208;quinonoid intermediate (  Prox&#8208;NPQ  ) with t  1/2  ca. 0.18 years at 298 K. The kinetic analysis of thermal reversion reveals that the bleaching of  Prox&#8208;NPQ  is entropically controlled; the steric effect due to the rigid triptycene scaffold renders  Prox&#8208;NP  a highly constrained system such that the photogenerated colored  o  &#8208;quinonoid form is more entropically relaxed. This constitutes the first instance of an entropically&#8208;controlled thermal reversion for the celebrated class of photochromic naphthopyrans. Based on the response of  Prox&#8208;NP  and its colored intermediate  Prox&#8208;NPQ  to different stimuli, namely, light, heat, and acid, the molecular system can be likened to a logic gate with the &#8216;INHIBIT&#8217; function.</dc:description>

         <title>Bridging Chemical Knowledge and Machine Learning for Performance Prediction of Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Predicting organic transformations is one of the most critical challenges in molecular syntheses. The synergy between machine learning and chemical knowledge provides a distinctive and powerful strategy for syntheses predictions. This Minireview summarizes the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art embedding approaches and model designs for developing synthesis&#8208;sensitive machine learning models to allow for robust yield and selectivity predictions in molecular syntheses.







Abstract
Recent years have witnessed a boom of machine learning (ML) applications in chemistry, which reveals the potential of data&#8208;driven prediction of synthesis performance. Digitalization and ML modelling are the key strategies to fully exploit the unique potential within the synergistic interplay between experimental data and the robust prediction of performance and selectivity. A series of exciting studies have demonstrated the importance of chemical knowledge implementation in ML, which improves the model's capability for making predictions that are challenging and often go beyond the abilities of human beings. This Minireview summarizes the cutting&#8208;edge embedding techniques and model designs in synthetic performance prediction, elaborating how chemical knowledge can be incorporated into machine learning until June 2022. By merging organic synthesis tactics and chemical informatics, we hope this Review can provide a guide map and intrigue chemists to revisit the digitalization and computerization of organic chemistry principles.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent years have witnessed a boom of machine learning (ML) applications in chemistry, which reveals the potential of data-driven prediction of synthesis performance. Digitalization and ML modelling are the key strategies to fully exploit the unique potential within the synergistic interplay between experimental data and the robust prediction of performance and selectivity. A series of exciting studies have demonstrated the importance of chemical knowledge implementation in ML, which improves the model's capability for making predictions that are challenging and often go beyond the abilities of human beings. This Minireview summarizes the cutting-edge embedding techniques and model designs in synthetic performance prediction, elaborating how chemical knowledge can be incorporated into machine learning until June 2022. By merging organic synthesis tactics and chemical informatics, we hope this Review can provide a guide map and intrigue chemists to revisit the digitalization and computerization of organic chemistry principles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Merging Rh&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;H Functionalization and Cascade Cyclization to Enable Propargylic Alcohols as Three&#8208;Carbon Synthons
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reverse regioselective insertion of propargyl alcohols into a rhodacycle is utilized to achieve indole&#8208;based precursors of a vinylogous iminium ion intermediate. Generation and trapping of this intermediate in&#8197;situ with different internal and external nucleophiles results in polycyclic cores of indole&#8208;containing natural products. Experimental studies along with DFT, NCI plots throw light on the reaction pathway.







Abstract
Reported herein is a reactivity of propargyl alcohols as &#8220;Three&#8208;Carbon Synthons&#8221; in a Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization of acetanilides, leading to the synthesis of core structures of isocryptolepine, &#947;&#8208;carbolines, dihydrochromeno[2,3&#8208;b]indoles, and diindolylmethanes (DIM) derivatives. The transformation involves a rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization and heteroannulation to yield indoles followed by a cascade cyclization with both external and internal nucleophiles to afford diverse products. The role of the hydroxy group, the key function of the silver additive, the origin of the reverse regioselectivity and the rate&#8208;determining step, are rationalized in conformity with the combination of experimental, noncovalent interaction analysis and DFT studies. This protocol is endowed with several salient features, including one&#8208;pot multistep cascade approach, exclusive regioselectivity, good functional group tolerance and synthesis of variety of molecular frameworks.

         <title>Interfacial C&#8722;S Bonds of g&#8208;C3N4/Bi19Br3S27 S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction for Enhanced Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction
</title>

         <dc:description>
The effective construction of interfacial C&#8722;S bond and built&#8208;in electric field in g&#8208;C3N4/Bi19Br3S27 S&#8208;scheme heterojunction improves the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, resulting excellent CO2 reduction performance.







Abstract
Step&#8208;scheme (S&#8208;scheme) heterojunctions have been extensively studied in photocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction due to their excellent charge separation and high redox ability. The built&#8208;in electric field at the interface of a S&#8208;scheme heterojunction serves as the driving force for charge transfer, however, the poor interfacial contact greatly restricts the carrier migration rate. Herein, we synthesized the g&#8208;C3N4/Bi19Br3S27 S&#8208;scheme heterostructure through in&#8197;situ deposition of Bi19Br3S27 (BBS) on porous g&#8208;C3N4 (P&#8208;CN) nanosheets. The C&#8722;S bonds formed at the interface help to enhance the built&#8208;in electric field, thereby promoting the charge transfer and separation. As a result, the CO2 reduction reaction performance of 10&#8201;%Bi19Br3S27/g&#8208;C3N4 (BBS/P&#8208;CN) reaches 32.78&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1h&#8722;1, which is 341.4 and 18.7 times higher than that of pure BBS and P&#8208;CN, respectively. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) prove the presence of chemical bonds (C&#8722;S) between the P&#8208;CN and BBS. The S&#8208;scheme charge&#8208;transfer mechanism was analyzed via XPS and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work provides a new idea for designing heterojunction photocatalysts with interfacial chemical bonds to achieve high charge&#8208;transfer and catalytic activity.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Readout of the Mechanical Response of a Bis&#8208;acridinium [2]Rotaxane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemochromic and electrochemical properties of a switchable bis&#8208;acridinium [2]rotaxane led to two different mechanical responses and an ON/OFF reading of the motion in the assembly. This work could lead to the use of the acridinium core as a recognition unit for radical templating through &#960;&#8208;mer formation.







Abstract
A [2]rotaxane built around a multi&#8208;responsive bis&#8208;acridinium macrocycle has been synthesized. Structural investigation has confirmed the interlocked nature of the molecule, and MD simulations illuminated its conformational dynamics with atomic resolution. Both halochromic and redox&#8208;switching properties were explored to shed light on the mechanical response and electronic changes that occur in the bis&#8208;acridinium [2]rotaxane. The topology of the rotaxane led to different mechanical behaviors upon addition of hydroxide ions or reduction that were easily detected by UV/Vis spectroscopy and electrochemistry.

         <title>Heterointerface Engineering of ZnO/CdS Heterostructures through ZnS Layers for Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>

Caught in the middle: By introducing a heterointerface layer of ZnS between ZnO and CdS, a Z&#8208;scheme charge&#8208;transfer channel is promoted and the as&#8208;prepared heterostructures display superior photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven water splitting to produce clean and renewable hydrogen offers a green strategy to address the energy crisis and environmental pollution. Heterostructure catalysts are receiving increasing attention for photocatalytic hydrogen generation. ZnO/ZnS/CdS and ZnO/CdS heterostructures have been successfully designed and prepared according to two different strategies. By introducing a heterointerface layer of ZnS between ZnO and CdS, a Z scheme charge&#8208;transfer channel was promoted and achieved superior photocatalytic performance. A highest hydrogen generation rate of 156.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 was achieved by precise control of the thickness of the heterointerface layer and of the CdS shell. These findings demonstrated that heterostructures are promising catalysts for solar&#8208;driven water splitting, and that heterointerface engineering is an effective way to improve the photocatalytic properties of heterostructures.

         <title>Stimulus&#8208;Responsive Lanthanide MOF Materials Encapsulated with Viologen Derivatives: Characterization, Photophysical Properties and Sensing on Nitrophenols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Six novel 3D Ln&#8208;NH2BDC MOFs encapsulating pbpyCl2 have been designed and synthesized. They are sensitive to visible light and exhibit a good reversible photochromic and photomodulated fluorescence phenomena. Moreover, they have a good detection effect on nitrophenols, especially 2,4,6&#8208;trinitrophenol (TNP).







Abstract
Viologens (1,1&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridyls) possessing electron&#8208;deficient properties and redox activity are a class of suitable chromophores to assemble metal&#8211;organic hybrid photochromic materials. Thus, viologen&#8208;functionalized metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted much attention for their photochromic properties; however, the syntheses of lanthanide&#8208;viologen hybrid crystalline photochromic materials still face many challenges. For example, the structures and properties of the final products are difficult to predict and are limited by molecular configurations. In this work, host&#8208;guest composite&#8208;material Ln&#8208;NH2BDC&#8208;pbpy MOFs were constructed by encapsulating viologen derivative pbpyCl2. The pbpy2+ moieties are uniformly embed by their &#960;&#8208;&#960; conjugation in the pores of the 3D structure by electrostatic interactions. Due to the encapsulation of the chromophore pbpy2+ moieties, Ln&#8208;NH2BDC&#8208;pbpy MOFs have reversible photochromic properties: they can change color after irradiation and can return to the original color after being protected from light or heating. Interestingly, the fluorescence intensity decreases with illumination time and recovers in the dark. As a result, Ln&#8208;NH2BDC&#8208;pbpy MOFs show both photochromic and photomodulated fluorescence. Based on the outstanding fluorescence performance of the Ln&#8208;NH2BDC&#8208;pbpy MOFs, they also show a wonderful effect for detecting nitrophenols, especially TNP.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Six novel 3D Ln-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BDC MOFs&lt;/b&gt; encapsulating pbpyCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; have been designed and synthesized. They are sensitive to visible light and exhibit a good reversible photochromic and photomodulated fluorescence phenomena. Moreover, they have a good detection effect on nitrophenols, especially 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viologens (1,1&#8217;-disubstituted 4,4&#8217;-bipyridyls) possessing electron-deficient properties and redox activity are a class of suitable chromophores to assemble metal&#8211;organic hybrid photochromic materials. Thus, viologen-functionalized metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted much attention for their photochromic properties; however, the syntheses of lanthanide-viologen hybrid crystalline photochromic materials still face many challenges. For example, the structures and properties of the final products are difficult to predict and are limited by molecular configurations. In this work, host-guest composite-material Ln-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BDC-pbpy MOFs were constructed by encapsulating viologen derivative pbpyCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The pbpy&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; moieties are uniformly embed by their &#960;-&#960; conjugation in the pores of the 3D structure by electrostatic interactions. Due to the encapsulation of the chromophore pbpy&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; moieties, Ln-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BDC-pbpy MOFs have reversible photochromic properties: they can change color after irradiation and can return to the original color after being protected from light or heating.

         <title>Carba&#8208;Sugar Analogs of Glucosamine&#8208;6&#8208;Phosphate: New Activators for the glmS Riboswitch</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of carba&#8208;sugars with an alkoxy substituent in the carba position has been synthesized. Key steps were a ring&#8208;closing metathesis and a hydroboration. The compounds have been tested for their ability to induce self&#8208;cleavage of the glmS ribozyme, which represents a potential drug target to fight bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Compound 32, with a methoxy substituent at the carba position, turned out to have the most promising properties.







Abstract
Riboswitches are 5&#8217;&#8208;untranslated mRNA regions mostly found in bacteria. They are promising drug targets to overcome emerging bacterial resistance against commonly used antibiotics. The glmS riboswitch is unique among the family of riboswitches as it is a ribozyme that undergoes self&#8208;cleavage upon binding to glucosamine&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate (GlcN6P). Previously, we showed that carba glucosamine&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate (carba&#8208;GlcN6P) induces self&#8208;cleavage of the riboswitch with a potency similar to that of GlcN6P. Here, we report a synthetic approach to a new class of carba&#8208;GlcN6P derivatives with an alkoxy substituent in the carba position. Key features of the synthesis are a ring closing metathesis followed by a hydroboration. The strategy gives access to libraries of carba&#8208;GlcN6P derivatives. Ribozyme cleavage assays unraveled new activators for the glmS riboswitch from Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium difficile.

         <title>Dithiolopyrrolones are Prochelators that are Activated by Glutathione</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural prochelators: Dithiolopyrrolones are promising antibiotics. They are reduced by glutathione after cell entry. The activated dithiol chelates essential metal ions in cells. We also report an expedient synthesis for natural derivatives.







Abstract
Dithiolopyrrolones (DTPs), such as holomycin, are natural products that hold promise as scaffolds for antibiotics as they exhibit inhibitory activity against antibiotic&#8208;resistant pathogens. They consist of a unique bicyclic core containing a disulfide that is crucial for their biological activity. Herein, we establish the DTPs as prochelators. We show that the disulfides are reduced at cellular gluathione levels. This activates the drugs and initiates interactions with targets, particularly metal coordination. In addition, we report an expedient synthesis for the DTPs thiolutin and aureothricin, providing facile access to important natural DTPs and derivatives thereof.

The asymmetric oxidative C&#8722;C homocoupling reaction of diarylamines using air as final oxidant is catalyzed by a hexadecafluorinated iron&#8208;phthalocyanine complex and an axially chiral biarylphosphoric acid. A radical cation&#8208;chiral phosphate anion pair is proposed as key intermediate responsible for the asymmetric induction.







Abstract
We describe an iron&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric oxidative C&#8722;C coupling of diarylamines which proceeds at room temperature with air as final oxidant. Using hexadecafluorophthalocyanine&#8208;iron(II) as catalyst in the presence of catalytic amounts of an axially chiral biarylphosphoric acid, the resulting chiral 2,2&#8242;&#8208;diamino&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biaryls are obtained in up to 90&#8201;% ee as confirmed by chiral HPLC. A detailed mechanism has been proposed with a radical cation&#8208;chiral phosphate ion pair as key intermediate leading to the observed asymmetric induction.

         <title>Organophotocatalytic [2+2] Cycloaddition of Electron&#8208;Deficient Styrenes
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [2+2] cycloaddition of alkenes is a powerful method of preparing cyclobutanes, but the use of electron&#8208;deficient styrenes has been largely neglected so far. By using the organophotocatalyst 4CzIPN, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated procedure to cyclobutane motifs bearing electron&#8208;deficient aryl substituents has been developed. Homodimerisations as well as intramolecular reactions to fused bicyclic motifs can be performed in good to excellent yields.







Abstract
A visible&#8208;light organophotocatalytic [2+2] cycloaddition of electron&#8208;deficient styrenes is described. Photocatalytic [2+2] cycloadditions are typically performed with electron&#8208;rich styrene derivatives or &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds, and with transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts. We have discovered that an organic cyanoarene photocatalyst is able to deliver high&#8208;value cyclobutane products bearing electron&#8208;deficient aryl substituents in good yields. A range of electron&#8208;deficient substituents are tolerated, and both homodimerisations and intramolecular [2+2] cycloadditions to fused bicyclic systems are available by using this methodology.

         <title>Li2Ba4Al2Ta2N8O, the First Barium Nitridoalumotantalate with BCT&#8208;Zeolite Type Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel compound Li2Ba4Al2Ta2N8O:Eu2+ was synthesized by a high&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state reaction in a tantalum ampule. The network in the structure of Li2Ba4Al2Ta2N8O is build up from AlN4 and TaN4 tetrahedra, which form a three&#8208;dimensional network corresponding to the BCT&#8208;zeolite type structure. The new compound is homeotypic to Li2Sr4Al2Ta2N8O and Li2Sr4Si4N8O but, additionally, it could be successfully doped with the activator ion Eu2+ exhibiting interesting luminescence properties.

Single&#8208;crystals of Li2Ba4Al2Ta2N8O:Eu2+ were synthesized from Ba3N2, Al2O3, Li3N, Eu2O3, and lithium metal by a high&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state reaction in a weld shut tantalum ampule. The crystal structure of Li2Ba4Al2Ta2N8O was determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and it crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pnnm (no. 58) with the lattice parameters a=1006.71(3), b=1026.58(3), c=607.10(2) pm, and a volume of V=0.62742(3) nm3. The compound is built up from AlN4 and TaN4 tetrahedra, which form a three&#8208;dimensional network corresponding to the BCT&#8208;zeolite type structure. Li2Ba4Al2Ta2N8O is homeotypic to Li2Sr4Si4N8O and Li2Sr4Al2Ta2N8O but, additionally, it could be successfully doped with the activator ion Eu2+ and hence features an experimental observed overall emission at &#955;max=565&#8197;nm (fwhm=89&#8197;nm) consisting of a superposition of two adjusted emission bands at &#955;max=557&#8197;nm (fwhm=69&#8197;nm) and at &#955;max=604&#8197;nm (fwhm=102&#8197;nm).

         <title>The Effect of Hydrogenation on the Contest between Aromaticity and Antiaromaticity in Norcorrole</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Magnetic shielding studies demonstrate that successive hydrogenation of NiII norcorrole (NiNc), a stable molecule combining aromatic and antiaromatic features, first weakens and then eliminates the central antiaromatic region, even though the NiNc antiaromatic &#8220;core&#8221;, a 14&#8208;membered conjugated cycle with 16 &#960; electrons, is formally preserved throughout the H2NiNc&#8722;H8NiNc series. The differences between aromatic and non&#8208;aromatic isotropic shielding distributions and nucleus&#8208;independent chemical shift (NICS) values in these hydrogenated porphyrin analogues are highlighted by comparing the results for the members of the H2NiNc&#8722;H8NiNc series to those for the aromatic NiII porphyrin complex. The results strongly support the unexpected and counterintuitive conclusion that H8NiNc will be nonaromatic, without even a trace of antiaromaticity. Based on these findings, H8NiNc is predicted to be the most stable member of the H2NiNc&#8722;H8NiNc series.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The first concise and efficient synthesis of some fluorine&#8208;containing morpholino nucleosides analogs has been developed. One synthetic strategy was based on the oxidative ring cleavage of the vicinal diol unit of uridine, cytidine adenosine and guanosine derivatives, followed by cyclisation of the dialdehyde intermediates by double reductive amination with fluorinated primary amines to obtain various N&#8208;fluoroalkylated morpholinos.

         <title>Fluorescent Nanoassemblies in Water Exhibiting Tunable LCST Behavior and Responsive Light Harvesting Ability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Responsive fluorescent nanomaterials have been received considerable attention in recent years. In this work, we synthesized a bola&#8208;type amphiphilic molecule CSO, which contains a hydrophobic cyanostilbene core and hydrophilic oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) coils at both sides. The cyanostilbene group is aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) active, while the OEG coils are thermo&#8208;responsive. As a result, the CSO molecules can self&#8208;assemble into blue&#8208;fluorescent nanoassemblies with lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior in aqueous media. It is noteworthy that the LCST behavior can be reversibly regulated with changes in concentration and the introduction of K+. Intriguingly, fluorescence of CSO assembly shows a blue&#8208;shift upon heating. Finally, by employing CSO as a light capturing antenna and energy donor, an artificial light harvesting system with tunable emission and thermo&#8208;responsive characteristics was fabricated. Our study not only demonstrates an integrated approach to create responsive fluorescent nanomaterials, but also shows great potential for producing luminescent materials and mimicking light harvesting in nature.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidative Desymmetrization Enables the Concise Synthesis of a trans&#8208;Cyclooctene Linker for Bioorthogonal Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioorthogonal cleavage of trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) linkers triggered by a click reaction with tetrazines has enabled new concepts in chemical biology and in vivo chemistry. We introduce a new dioxolane&#8208;fused cleavable TCO linker (dcTCO) with high stability and reduced lipophilicity that can be prepared in five steps and demonstrate its application in bioorthogonal prodrug activation, achieving a remarkable &gt;1000&#8208;fold &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; in cytotoxicity.







Abstract
Modified trans&#8208;cyclooctenes (TCO) are capable of highly efficient molecular manipulations in biological environments, driven by the bioorthogonal reaction with tetrazines (Tz). The development of click&#8208;cleavable TCO has fueled the field of in&#8197;vivo chemistry and enabled the design of therapeutic strategies that have already started to enter the clinic. A key element for most of these approaches is the implementation of a cleavable TCO linker. So far, only one member of this class has been developed, a compound that requires a high synthetic effort, mainly to fulfill the multilayered demands on its chemical structure. To tackle this limitation, we developed a dioxolane&#8208;fused cleavable TCO linker (dcTCO) that can be prepared in only five steps by applying an oxidative desymmetrization to achieve diastereoselective introduction of the required functionalities. Based on investigation of the structure, reaction kinetics, stability, and hydrophilicity of dcTCO, we demonstrate its bioorthogonal application in the design of a caged prodrug that can be activated by in&#8208;situ Tz&#8208;triggered cleavage to achieve a remarkable &gt;1000&#8208;fold increase in cytotoxicity.

The development of click-cleavable TCO has fueled the field of in&#8197;vivo chemistry and enabled the design of therapeutic strategies that have already started to enter the clinic. A key element for most of these approaches is the implementation of a cleavable TCO linker. So far, only one member of this class has been developed, a compound that requires a high synthetic effort, mainly to fulfill the multilayered demands on its chemical structure. To tackle this limitation, we developed a dioxolane-fused cleavable TCO linker (dcTCO) that can be prepared in only five steps by applying an oxidative desymmetrization to achieve diastereoselective introduction of the required functionalities. Based on investigation of the structure, reaction kinetics, stability, and hydrophilicity of dcTCO, we demonstrate its bioorthogonal application in the design of a caged prodrug that can be activated by in-situ Tz-triggered cleavage to achieve a remarkable &amp;gt;1000-fold increase in cytotoxicity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface Modification, Topographic Design and Applications of Superhydrophobic Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superhydrophobic surfaces with expanded wetting behaviors like tunable adhesion, hybrid surface hydrophobicity and smart hydrophobic switching, have attracted increasing attention due to their broad applications. This review mainly focuses on recent advances in surface modification, topographic design and the application of superhydrophobic systems.







Abstract
Superhydrophobic surfaces with expanded wetting behaviors, like tunable adhesion, hybrid surface hydrophobicity and smart hydrophobic switching have attracted increasing attention due to their broad applications. Herein, the construction methods, mechanisms and advanced applications of special superhydrophobicity are reviewed, and hydro/superhydrophobic modifications are categorized and discussed based on their surface chemistry, and topographic design. The formation and maintenance of special superhydrophobicity in the metastable state are also examined and explored. In addition, particular attention is paid to the use of special wettability in various applications, such as membrane distillation, droplet&#8208;based electricity generators and anti&#8208;fogging surfaces. Finally, the challenges for practical applications and future research directions are discussed.

         <title>Efficient Synthesis of Diaryl Quaternary Centers by Rh(II)/Xantphos Catalyzed Relay C&#8722;H Functionalization and Allylic Alkylation</title>

A dirhodium(II)/Xantphos catalyzed three&#8208;component reaction of N, N&#8208;disubstituted anilines, &#945;&#8208;diazo esters, and allylic compounds was developed, affording various aniline derivatives with diaryl allylic quaternary centers in good yields under mild conditions. The reaction proceeds via para C(sp2)&#8722;H functionalization of aniline derivatives by Rh(II)&#8208;carbenoid intermediate, and subsequent [Rh2]/Xantphos&#8208;catalyzed allylic alkylation of the resulting &#945;, &#945;&#8208;diarylacetate intermediate.







Abstract
A three&#8208;component reaction of N, N&#8208;disubstituted aniline, &#945;&#8208;diazo ester, and an allylic electrophile has been realized by [Rh(II)]2/Xantphos catalysis, providing a direct access to various aniline derivatives bearing diaryl allylic quaternary centers in good yields. The synthetic utility of this protocol was demonstrated by facile derivatization of the products for preparation of biologically relevant molecules and structural scaffolds, which offers a high potential for increasing the molecular diversity. Mechanistic studies identified &#945;, &#945;&#8208;diarylacetate species as an active intermediate, thereby revealing the presence of a C(sp2)&#8722;H functionalization of aniline derivatives/allylic alkylation cascade in this attractive catalytic transformation.

         <title>Rational Design and Synthesis of D&#8208;galactosyl Lysophospholipids as Selective Substrates and non&#8208;ATP&#8208;competitive Inhibitors of Phosphatidylinositol Phosphate Kinases</title>

New&#8208;to&#8208;Nature D&#8208;galactosyl lysophospholipids were rationally designed and synthesized to act as artificial substrates and non&#8208;ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases, which are validated drug targets for deadly human diseases including cancers, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and SARS&#8208;COVID&#8208;2 infection. Rational Design and Synthesis of D&#8208;galactosyl Lysophospholipids as Selective Substrates and non&#8208;ATP&#8208;competitive Inhibitors of Phosphatidylinositol Phosphate Kinases (X. Huang, J. Hu et&#8197;al.)







Abstract
Phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases (PIPKs) produce lipid signaling molecules and have been attracting increasing attention as drug targets for cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and viral infection. Given the potential cross&#8208;inhibition of kinases and other ATP&#8208;utilizing enzymes by ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors, targeting the unique lipid substrate binding site represents a superior strategy for PIPK inhibition. Here, by taking advantage of the nearly identical stereochemistry between myo&#8208;inositol and D&#8208;galactose, we designed and synthesized a panel of D&#8208;galactosyl lysophospholipids, one of which was found to be a selective substrate of phosphatidylinositol 4&#8208;phosphate 5&#8208;kinase. Derivatization of this compound led to the discovery of a human PIKfyve inhibitor with an apparent IC50 of 6.2&#8197;&#956;M, which significantly potentiated the inhibitory effect of Apilimod, an ATP&#8208;competitive PIKfyve inhibitor under clinical trials against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Our results provide the proof of concept that D&#8208;galactose&#8208;based phosphoinositide mimetics can be developed into artificial substrates and new inhibitors of PIPKs.
