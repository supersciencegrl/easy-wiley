         <title>Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells Employing Electron Injection/Transport Layers of Ionic Transition Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The optimized external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the proposed LEC reaches 6.8&#8201;%, which is among the highest values for perovskite LECs reported so far. This work successfully demonstrates that separating the ion transport, electron injection and transport layer from the perovskite emissive layer is more effective in adjusting device carrier balance than mixing all the components in a single emissive layer. As such, solution&#8208;processable perovskite/complex LECs open up a new way to realize efficient perovskite LECs.







Abstract
Recently, perovskites have attracted intense attention due to their high potential in optoelectronic applications. Employing perovskites as the emissive materials of light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) shows the advantages of simple fabrication process, low&#8208;voltage operation, and compatibility with inert electrodes, along with saturated electroluminescence (EL) emission. Unlike in previously reported perovskite LECs, in which salts are incorporated in the emissive layer, the ion&#8208;transport layer was separated from the emissive layer in this work. The layer of ionic transition metal complex (iTMC) not only provides mobile ions but also serves as an electron&#8208;injection/transport layer. Orthogonal solvents are used in spin coating to prevent the intermixing of stacked perovskite and iTMC layers. The blue iTMC with high ionization potential is effective in blocking holes from the emissive layer and thus ensures EL color saturation. In addition, the carrier balance of the perovskite/iTMC LECs can be optimized by adjusting the iTMC layer thickness. The optimized external quantum efficiency of the CsPbBr3/iTMC LEC reaches 6.8&#8201;%, which is among the highest reported values for perovskite LECs. This work successfully demonstrates that, compared with mixing all components in a single emissive layer, separating the layer of ion transport, electron injection and transport from the perovskite emissive layer is more effective in adjusting device carrier balance. As such, solution&#8208;processable perovskite/iTMC LECs open up a new way to realize efficient perovskite LECs.

         <title>Regioselective Magnesiation and Zincation Reactions of Aromatics and Heterocycles Triggered by Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switch at Will: The functionalization of aromatics and heterocycles by using Zn&#8208; or Mg&#8208;TMP (TMP=2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidyl) bases has been widely explored. In many cases, a full switch of regioselectivity can be achieved in the presence of a Lewis acid additive. Also, these methods are compatible with continuous flow setups allowing the use of highly reactive lithium bases under practical reaction conditions.







Abstract
Mixed TMP&#8208;bases (TMP=2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidyl), such as TMPMgCl&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;LiCl, TMP2Mg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2LiCl, TMPZnCl&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;LiCl and TMP2Zn&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2LiCl, are outstanding reagents for the metalation of functionalized aromatics and heterocycles. In the presence of Lewis acids, such as BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2 or MgCl2, the metalation scope of such bases was dramatically increased, and regioselectivity switches were achieved in the presence or absence of these Lewis acids. Furthermore, highly reactive lithium bases, such as TMPLi or Cy2NLi, are also compatible with various Lewis acids, such as MgCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2LiCl, ZnCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2LiCl or CuCN&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2LiCl. Performing such metalations in continuous flow using commercial setups permitted practical and convenient reaction conditions.

Vis&#8208;&#224;&#8211;vis going green Thermal stimuli induced the single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal phase transition of the blue&#8208;PL face&#8208;to&#8208;edge packed 1,8&#8208;bisphenylanthracene crystal, which experienced spontaneous propagation of the face&#8208;to&#8208;face molecular packed greenish&#8208;blue&#8208;PL crystal.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;triggered crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal and single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformations have received significant attention in the scientific community. To visualize such phenomenon, controlling the optical properties and the thermodynamic stability of the molecular crystals is a very important research subject. In this report, the selective growth of photoluminescent (PL) 1,8&#8208;bisphenylanthracene polymorphic (cI and cII) and 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane&#8208;inclusion crystals (iC) under various optimized conditions is described. These crystals exhibited unique mechano&#8208; and thermoresponsive disordering, crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal phase transition, and SCSC phase transition. In particular, rapid thermostimulus SCSC occurred from blue&#8208;PL cI into greenish&#8208;blue&#8208;PL cII. Interestingly, the SCSC phase transition of cI into cII was triggered by thermal stimuli and propagated spontaneously. Thermotriggered domino&#8208;like SCSC phase transition was observed on a fully visible timescale (ca. 125&#8197;&#956;m&#8201;min&#8722;1).

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Regiodivergence for Catalytic Stereoselective Semireduction of Allenamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed, ligand controlled regiodivergent semireduction of allenamides has been developed. This phosphine ligand&#8208;switched semireduction system has enabled an easy access to a broad scope of allylic and vinylic amides by using a single palladium catalyst. The excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities of the divergent processes were achieved by the employment of monodentate Xphos and bidentate BINAP ligands (see scheme).







Abstract
Ligand&#8208;controlled regiodivergence has been developed for catalytic semireduction of allenamides with excellent chemo&#8208; and stereocontrol. This system also provides an example of catalytic regiodivergent semireduction of allenes for the first time. The divergence of the semireduction is enabled by ligand switch with the same palladium pre&#8208;catalyst under operationally simple and mild conditions. Monodentate ligand XPhos exclusively promotes selective 1,2&#8208;semireduction to afford allylic amides, while bidentate ligand BINAP completely switched the regioselectivity to 2,3&#8208;semireduction, producing (E)&#8208;enamide derivatives.

         <title>Maytansinol Derivatives: Side Reactions as a Chance for New Tubulin Binders</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploring the maytansinol acylation reaction, we have discovered previously unreported structural modifications of the maytansine scaffold. This permitted the synthesis and full characterization of a series of novel maytansinoids. A comprehensive biochemical evaluation and X&#8208;ray crystallography structure determinations of tubulin&#8208;maytansinoids identified potent tubulin binders. Moreover, our investigation allowed us to evaluate the impact of the structural modifications described.







Abstract
Maytansinol is a valuable precursor for the preparation of maytansine derivatives (known as maytansinoids). Inspired by the intriguing structure of the macrocycle and the success in targeted cancer therapy of the derivatives, we explored the maytansinol acylation reaction. As a result, we were able to obtain a series of derivatives with novel modifications of the maytansine scaffold. We characterized these molecules by docking studies, by a comprehensive biochemical evaluation, and by determination of their crystal structures in complex with tubulin. The results shed further light on the intriguing chemical behavior of maytansinoids and confirm the relevance of this peculiar scaffold in the scenario of tubulin binders.

         <title>Rational Design and Facile Synthesis of Dual&#8208;State Emission Fluorophores: Expanding Functionality for the Sensitive Detection of Nitroaromatic Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel benzimidazole&#8208;based D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A fluorophores are rationally designed and concisely synthesized. Six compounds 4&#8201;a&#8211;4&#8201;f, as dual&#8208;state emission (DSE) materials, exhibit excellent photostability, solvatofluorochromic and extraordinary wide range of solvent compatibility. Among them, the DSE material 4&#8201;a is not only reasonably developed as a multifunctional fluorescent probe for sensitive detection of nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) in aqueous system, but also processed into test strips and thin films for visual detection of NACs.







Abstract
Six novel benzimidazole&#8208;based D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A compounds 4&#8201;a&#8211;4&#8201;f were concisely synthesized by attaching different donor/acceptor units to the skeleton of 1,3&#8208;bis(1H&#8208;benzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzene on its 5&#8208;position through an ethynyl link. Due to the twisted conformation and effective conjugation structure, these dual&#8208;state emission (DSE) molecules show intense and multifarious photoluminescence, and their fluorescence quantum yields in solution and solid state can be up to 96.16 and 69.82&#8201;%, respectively. Especially, for excellent photostability, obvious solvatofluorochromic and extraordinary wide range of solvent compatibility, DSE molecule 4&#8201;a is a multifunctional fluorescent probe for the visual detection of nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) with the limit of detection as low as 10&#8722;7 M. The quenching mechanism has been proved as the results of photoinduced electron transfer and fluorescence resonance energy transfer processes. Importantly, probe 4&#8201;a can sensitively detect NACs not only in real water samples, but also on 4&#8201;a&#8208;coated strips and 4&#8201;a@PBAT thin films.

         <title>An Alternative Route to Complex Allenes or Cyclooctatrienes via a Suzuki Cyclocarbopalladation Cascade</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preparation of elaborate polycycles using the Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling reaction has been developed. If compounds 1&#8201;a&#8211;c are substituted by a triple bond an unusual cascade reaction affords allene derivatives 3 stereoselectively, while the presence of a substituted double bond, when reacted with a boronic ester or acid on 4, furnishes polysubstituted cyclooctatrienes 22 in high yields.







Abstract
The 4&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclocarbopalladation of vinyl bromides substituted with a triple or double bond resulted in impressive cascade reactions leading to different compounds under Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling conditions upon a slight modification of the starting material. When the starting compound carries a triple bond, a single cascade occurs providing a structure containing an allene, a tetrasubstituted cyclopropane, and a cyclobutene with complete stereoselectivity. When the related starting material possessing a double bond is reacted under the same conditions in the presence of various vinyl boronic esters or acids, an efficient 8&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization provides tricyclic systems comprised of a cyclobutene unit, as well as a cyclooctatriene. Five carbons of the latter can be selectively decorated with different substituents depending on the choice of the starting material and the boronic coupling partner.

         <title>Base&#8208;Mediated Radical Borylation of Alkyl Sulfones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The utilization of inactivated alkyl sulfones as alkyl radical precursors in a base&#8208;mediated borylation reaction with B2neop2 is reported, allowing direct access to valuable alkyl boronate esters without further transesterification. This approach is scalable and is tolerant to a variety of functional groups and substrates including complex molecules.







Abstract
A practical and direct method was developed for the production of versatile alkyl boronate esters via transition metal&#8208;free borylation of primary and secondary alkyl sulfones. The key to the success of the strategy is the use of bis(neopentyl glycolato) diboron (B2neop2), with a stoichiometric amount of base as a promoter. The practicality and industrial potential of this protocol are highlighted by its wide functional group tolerance, the late&#8208;stage modification of complex compounds, no need for further transesterification, and operational simplicity. Radical clock, radical trap experiments, and EPR studies were conducted which show that the borylation process involves radical intermediates.

         <title>Ring Size Determines the Conformation, Global Aromaticity and Photophysical Properties of Macrocyclic Oligofurans</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tradeoff between global and local aromaticity is demonstrated for a new series of macrocyclic furans. The global antiaromatic character decreases with macrocycle size, whereas the local aromatic character increases. This trend, which is observed both experimentally and computationally, is explained by the distortion of the larger macrocycles out of planarity.







Abstract
In &#960;&#8208;conjugated macrocycles, there is a trade&#8208;off between the global and local expression of effects such as aromaticity, with the outcome of the trade&#8208;off determined by the geometry and aromaticity of the constituent units. Compared with other aromatic rings, the aromatic character of furan is relatively small, and therefore global effects in macrocyclic furans are expected to be more pronounced. Following our introduction of macrocyclic oligofuran, we present the first synthesis of a series of &#960;&#8208;conjugated bifuran macrocycles of various ring sizes, from trimer to hexamer, and characterize them using both computational and experimental methods. The properties of macrocyclic oligofurans change considerably with size: The smaller trimer is rigid, weakly emissive and planar as revealed by its single crystal structure, and displays global antiaromaticity. In contrast, the larger pentamer and hexamer are flexible, emissive, have non&#8208;planar structures, and exhibit local aromaticity. The results are supported by NICS and ACID calculations that indicate the global antiaromaticity of planar furan macrocycles, and by transient absorption measurements showing sharp absorption band for the trimer and only the internal conversion decay pathway.

         <title>Enhancing the Catalytic Activity of MOF&#8208;808 Towards Peptide Bond Hydrolysis through Synthetic Modulations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modulating the synthesis of MOF&#8208;808 through choice of zirconium precursor directly impacts its structure and reactivity towards the hydrolysis of peptide bonds, outweighing the influence of MOF defects or particle size.







Abstract
The performance of MOFs in catalysis is largely derived from structural features, and much work has focused on introducing structural changes such as defects or ligand functionalisation to boost the reactivity of the MOF. However, the effects of different parameters chosen for the synthesis on the catalytic reactivity of the resulting MOF remains poorly understood. Here, we evaluate the role of metal precursor on the reactivity of Zr&#8208;based MOF&#8208;808 towards hydrolysis of the peptide bond in the glycylglycine model substrate. In addition, the effect of synthesis temperature and duration has been investigated. Surprisingly, the metal precursor was found to have a large influence on the reactivity of the MOF, surpassing the effect of particle size or number of defects. Additionally, we show that by careful selection of the Zr&#8208;salt precursor and temperature used in MOF syntheses, equally active MOF catalysts could be obtained after a 20&#8197;minute synthesis compared to 24&#8197;h synthesis.

         <title>Synthesis, Structures, and Properties of Helically Fused Anthraquinones with Unusually Close Carbonyl&#8208;Carbonyl Contacts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three anthraquinone units are angularly fused to construct a helical structure with sterically congested carbonyl groups, which influence structure, dynamic behavior, and spectroscopic and electrochemical properties relative to those of the anthracene analogs. The unusually close CO&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;CO contacts (2.47&#8197;&#197;) are discussed in terms of noncovalent interactions based on theoretical approaches.







Abstract
Electron&#8208;deficient aromatic ketones consisting of three fused anthraquinone units were synthesized by oxidation of the corresponding fused anthracenes. X&#8208;ray analysis revealed that these compounds had nonplanar helical structures with unusual contacts, C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C=O 2.467&#8197;&#197;, between the inner carbonyl groups. The role of n&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;* interactions in the short contacts was evaluated using a noncovalent interaction plot and natural bond orbital analysis. The dynamic process involving helical inversion was observed by the variable temperature 1H NMR measurement of a derivative with 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl groups, and the barrier was estimated to be 77&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. DFT calculations indicated that the helical inversion proceeded via a multistep mechanism. The characteristic spectroscopic and electrochemical data due to the electron&#8208;deficient anthraquinone units and the sterically congested carbonyl groups are discussed with the aid of DFT calculations.

         <title>Size&#8208;Induced Inversion of Selectivity in the Acylation of 1,2&#8208;Diols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Lewis&#8208;base catalyzed acylation of aromatic 1,2&#8208;ethylenediols with anhydrides depends strongly on the size of the reagents and the &#960;&#8208;system of the diol. Steric effects have a larger impact on reactions of primary hydroxyl groups in the 1,2&#8208;diol as well as the monoester than those of secondary hydroxyl groups. For sterically demanding anhydrides this flips the selectivity towards secondary alcohols.







Abstract
Relative rates for the Lewis base&#8208;catalyzed acylation of aryl&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;diols with anhydrides differing in size have been determined by turnover&#8208;limited competition experiments and absolute kinetics measurements. Depending on the structure of the anhydride reagent, the secondary hydroxyl group of the 1,2&#8208;diol reacts faster than the primary one. This preference towards the secondary hydroxyl group is boosted in the second acylation step from the monoesters to the diester through size and additional steric effects. In absolute terms the first acylation step is found to be up to 35&#8197;times faster than the second one for the primary alcohols due to neighboring group effects.

         <title>Bulky PNP Ligands Blocking Metal&#8208;Ligand Cooperation Allow for Isolation of Ru(0), and Lead to Catalytically Active Ru Complexes in Acceptorless Alcohol Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized two 4Me&#8722;PNP Ru complexes and compared their catalytic performance against two traditional analogues used in acceptorless alcohol dehydrogenation catalysis, leading us to identify a common deactivation pathway. The 4Me&#8722;PNP complexes, which do not undergo dearomatization upon addition of base, also allowed us to obtain rare, albeit unstable, 16 electron mono&#8208;CO Ru(0), and their subsequent Ru(II) reaction products.







Abstract
We synthesized two 4Me&#8722;PNP ligands which block metal&#8208;ligand cooperation (MLC) with the Ru center and compared their Ru complex chemistry to their two traditional analogues used in acceptorless alcohol dehydrogenation catalysis. The corresponding 4Me&#8722;PNP complexes, which do not undergo dearomatization upon addition of base, allowed us to obtain rare, albeit unstable, 16 electron mono&#8208;CO Ru(0) complexes. Reactivity with CO and H2 allows for stabilization and extensive characterization of bis&#8208;CO Ru(0) 18 electron and Ru(II) cis and trans dihydride species that were also shown to be capable of C(sp2) &#8722;H activation. Reactivity and catalysis are contrasted to non&#8208;methylated Ru(II) species, showing that an MLC pathway is not necessary, with dramatic differences in outcomes during catalysis between iPr and tBu PNP complexes within each of the 4Me and non&#8208;methylated backbone PNP series being observed. Unusual intermediates are characterized in one of the new and one of the traditional complexes, and a common catalysis deactivation pathway was identified.

         <title>Joint Venture of Metal Cluster and Amphiphilic Cationic Minidendron Resulting in Near Infrared Emissive Lamellar Ionic Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guanidinium minidendrons bearing terminal aliphatic chains show a columnar liquid&#8208;crystalline behaviour once associated with chlorine anions, whereas they turned into layered phases when associated with phosphorescent octahedral molybdenum cluster dianions. The emission properties of the inorganic dyes are largely influenced by the minidendron chain length in these first&#8208;of&#8208;their&#8208;kind clustomesogens.







Abstract
Inorganic red&#8208;NIR emissive materials are particularly relevant in many fields like optoelectronic, bioimaging or solar cells. Benefiting from their emission in devices implies their integration in easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle materials like liquid crystals, whose long&#8208;range ordering and self&#8208;healing abilities could be exploited and influence emission. Herein, we present red&#8208;NIR emissive hybrid materials obtained with phosphorescent octahedral molybdenum cluster anions electrostatically associated with amphiphilic guanidinium minidendrons. Polarized optical microscopy and X&#8208;ray analysis show that while the minidendron chloride salts self&#8208;organize into columnar phases, their association with the dianionic metal cluster leads to layered phases. Steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved emission investigations demonstrate the influence of the minidendron alkyl chain length on the phosphorescence of the metal cluster core.

         <title>Tunable Synchronicity of Molecular Valence Tautomerism with Macroscopic Solid&#8208;Liquid Transition by Molecular Lattice Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 66, Page 16354-16366, November 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synchronicity of molecular valence tautomerism (VT) and macroscopic solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid phase transition has been rationally tuned by crystal lattice engineering in a new series of bistable valence tautomeric cobalt complexes [Co(3,6&#8208;DTBQ)2(L)2] (3,6&#8208;DTBQ&#8201;=&#8201;3,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsemiquinonato/catecholato) with two ancillary pyridine ligands (L) substituted with di&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, and hexa(ethylene glycol) groups.







Abstract
The combination of a cobalt&#8208;dioxolene core that exhibits valence tautomerism (VT) with pyridine&#8208;3,5&#8208;dicarboxylic acid functionalized with chains bearing two, four, or six oxyethylene units led to new complexes ConEGEspy (n&#8201;=&#8201;2, 4, and 6). These complexes commonly form violet crystals of the low&#8208;spin (ls)&#8208;[CoIII(nEGEspy)2(3,6&#8208;DTBSQ)(3,6&#8208;DTBCat)] (ls&#8208;[CoIII], 3,6&#8208;DTBSQ&#8201;=&#8201;3,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl semiquinonato, 3,6&#8208;DTBCat&#8201;=&#8201;3,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl catecholato). Interestingly, violet crystals of Co2EGEspy in the ls&#8208;[CoIII] transitioned into a green liquid, accompanied by an almost complete VT shift (94&#8201;%) to the high&#8208;spin (hs)&#8208;[CoII(nEGEspy)2(3,6&#8208;DTBSQ)2] (hs&#8208;[CoII]) upon melting. In contrast, violet crystals of Co4EGEspy and Co6EGEspy in the ls&#8208;[CoIII] exhibited partial VT (33&#8201;%) and only a 9.3&#8201;% VT shift after melting, respectively. These data demonstrate the tunability of the synchronicity of the molecular VT and macroscopic solid&#8208;liquid transitions by optimizing the tethered chains, thus establishing a new strategy for coupling bistable molecules with the macroscopic world.

         <title>Control of Protonated Schiff Base Excited State Decay within Visual Protein Mimics: A Unified Model for Retinal Chromophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 66, Page 16389-16400, November 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A joint experimental&#8208;computational study elucidates the photophysics of retinal Schiff bases embedded in artificial proteins capable of mimicking the color tunability of natural visual pigments as compared to solvated chromophores. Combining ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations allowed monitoring nonlinear optical signals of the chromophore, shedding light on the complexity beyond the fine control of its excited state lifetime.







Abstract
Artificial biomimetic chromophore&#8208;protein complexes inspired by natural visual pigments can feature color tunability across the full visible spectrum. However, control of excited state dynamics of the retinal chromophore, which is of paramount importance for technological applications, is lacking due to its complex and subtle photophysics/photochemistry. Here, ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations are combined for the study of highly tunable rhodopsin mimics, as compared to retinal chromophores in solution. Conical intersections and transient fluorescent intermediates are identified with atomistic resolution, providing unambiguous assignment of their ultrafast excited state absorption features. The results point out that the electrostatic environment of the chromophore, modified by protein point mutations, affects its excited state properties allowing control of its photophysics with same power of chemical modifications of the chromophore. The complex nature of such fine control is a fundamental knowledge for the design of bio&#8208;mimetic opto&#8208;electronic and photonic devices.

         <title>Host&#8208;Guest Systems on the Surface of Functionalized Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles (SPIONs) Utilizing Hamilton Receptors and Cyanurate Derivative Molecules</title>

Fundamental insight of supramolecular interactions on the surface of modified superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) utilizing host&#8208;guest chemistry among Hamilton receptors and cyanurate derivatives. Binding constants of host&#8208;guest systems on the surface of nanoparticles showed stronger binding constant and higher binding ratio compared to free molecules in the solutions, due to synergistic effect on complex surface environment.







Abstract
The study of hydrogen bonding interactions at the level of functionalized nanoparticles remains highly challenging and poorly explored area. In this work, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) were orthogonally functionalized using receptors bearing multiple hydrogen bonding motifs. Pristine SPIONs were modified by wet chemical processes with Hamilton receptors (hosts), or cyanurate&#8208;guest molecules linked to phosphonic acid moieties for monolayer functionalization. The modified surfaces were fully characterized and the number of attached ligands on the surface were determined. The host&#8208;guest interactions on the interface of modified SPIONs were investigated by using UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopic titrations. Functionalized SPIONs demonstrated two to three magnitudes stronger binding affinities as compared to the related molecular interactions in solution due to synergistic effects on complex surface environment. Higher supramolecular binding ratios of host&#8208;guest interactions on the modified surface were emerged. These studies provide fundamental insights into supramolecular complexations on the surface at solid&#8208;liquid interface systems with applications in engineered nanomaterials, nano&#8208;sensing devices, and drug delivery systems.

         <title>Determination of Relative Stabilities of Metal&#8208;Peptide Bonds in the Gas Phase</title>

Breaking bonds: Physiological environments are rich in potential ligands for metal&#8208;based drugs and understanding their molecular interactions with biomolecules is pivotal in the design and development of the next generation of metallodrugs. Energy&#8208;resolved mass spectrometry allows for measurement of relative bond stabilities in metal&#8208;peptide adducts in a quick and simple manner, providing data on the intrinsic properties of the adducts formed.







Abstract
Understanding binding site preferences in biological systems as well as affinities to binding partners is a crucial aspect in metallodrug development. We here present a mass spectrometry&#8208;based method to compare relative stabilities of metal&#8208;peptide adducts in the gas phase. Angiotensin 1 and substance P were used as model peptides. Incubation with isostructural N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes of RuII, OsII, RhIII, and IrIII led to the formation of various adducts, which were subsequently studied by energy&#8208;resolved fragmentation experiments. The gas&#8208;phase stability of the metal&#8208;peptide bonds depended on the metal and the binding partner. Of the four complexes used, the OsII derivative bound strongest to Met, while RuII formed the most stable coordination bond with His. RhIII was identified as the weakest peptide binder and IrIII formed peptide adducts with intermediate stability. Probing these intrinsic gas&#8208;phase properties can help in the interpretation of biological activities and the design of site&#8208;specific protein binding metal complexes.

         <title>Light&#8208; and pH&#8208;regulated Water&#8208;soluble Pseudorotaxanes Comprising a Cucurbit[7]uril and a Flavylium&#8208;based Axle</title>

         <dc:description>
A linear double pyridinium&#8208;terminated thread comprising a central trans&#8208;chalcone moiety forms pseudorotaxanes with cucurbit[7]uril (CB7), in water. Irradiation of the chalcone under slightly acidic conditions triggers the formation of the fluorescent cationic flavylium form with displacement of the CB7 ring along the thread, defining a pH&#8208;dependent photoswitch for ring translocation with fluorescence read&#8208;out. The system returns to the initial trans&#8208;chalcone state in the dark through a series of consecutive reversible reactions characteristic of flavylium&#8208;based molecular switches.







Abstract
A linear double pyridinium&#8208;terminated thread comprising a central chalcone moiety is shown to provide two independent binding sites with similar affinity for cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) macrocycles in water as judged from NMR, UV&#8208;Visible and fluorescence spectroscopies. Association results in [2] and [3]pseudorotaxanes, which are both pH and photosensitive. Switching from the neutral chalcone to the cationic flavylium form upon irradiation at 365&#8197;nm under acidic conditions provided an enhanced CB7 association (K1:1 increases from 1.2&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1 to 1.5&#215;108&#8197;M&#8722;1), limiting spontaneous on&#8208;thread cucurbituril shuttling. This co&#8208;conformational change in the [2]pseudorotaxane is reversible in the dark with kobs=4.1&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;s&#8722;1. Threading the flavylium moiety into CB7 leads to a dramatic increase in the fluorescence quantum yield, from 0.29 in the free axle to 0.97 in the [2]pseudorotaxane and 1.0 in the [3]pseudorotaxane.

         <title>Explaining the Advantageous Impact of Tertiary versus Secondary Nitrogen Center on the Activity of PNP&#8208;Pincer Co(I)&#8208;Complexes for Catalytic Hydrogenation of CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 66, Page 16407-16414, November 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Secondary PNP&#8208;pincer complexes are found to outperform tertiary analogue in various reactions as the former one exhibits metal&#8208;ligand cooperativity (MLC). But in a recent experiment of CO2 reduction reaction in alkaline medium, the tertiary complex has shown a much higher turnover number than the secondary complex and the underline reason is assumed to deteriorate effects of MLC on the secondary complex. So, here detailed density functional theory based kinetic calculations have been carried out explaining the actual reason for this anomaly.







Abstract
Pincer ligated coordination complexes of base metals have shown remarkable catalytic activity for hydrogenation/dehydrogenation of CO2. The recently reported MeN[CH2CH2(iPr2)]2Co(I)PNP&#8208;pincer complex was shown to exhibit substantially higher catalytic activity in comparison to the corresponding catalyst, HN[CH2CH2(iPr2)]2Co(I)PNP, bearing a secondary nitrogen center on the pincer ligand. Here, we computationally investigate the mechanisms for hydrogenation of CO2 to formate catalyzed by these two Co&#8208;PNP complexes to explain how such a small structural difference could have a sizable impact on their catalytic activity. Plausible hydrogenation routes were examined in details and our findings provide solid support for the experimental observations. Our results reveal that such trends in catalytic activity could be explained from the lower activation barrier for the hydride transfer step upon changing the pincer nitrogen center from secondary to tertiary.

         <title>Efficient Hydro&#8208; and Organogelation by Minimalistic Diketopiperazines Containing a Highly Insoluble Aggregation&#8208;Induced, Blue&#8208;Shifted Emission Luminophore**
</title>

         <dc:description>
Minimalistic and highly efficient hydro&#8208; and organogelators were obtained by the combination of a highly insoluble luminophore capable of aggregation&#8208;induced blue shifted emission (AIBSE) with natural amino&#8208;acid derived diketopiperazines. The gelators were investigated with regard to their aggregation and gelation behavior, and their photophysical and material properties. The modular approach demonstrates a potent strategy to turn an otherwise poorly soluble polycyclic aromatic compound into hydro&#8208; and organogelators.







Abstract
We report the synthesis, gelation abilities and aggregation&#8208;induced, blue&#8208;shifted emission (AIBSE) properties of two minimalistic diketopiperazine&#8208;based gelators. Despite containing a highly insoluble luminophore that makes up more than half of their respective molecular masses, efficient hydrogelation by multiple stimuli for one and efficient organogelation for the other compound are reported. Insights into the aggregation and gelation properties were gained through examination of the photophysical and material properties of selected gels, which are representative of the different modes of gelation. The synthesis of the gelators is highly modular and based on readily available amino acid building blocks, allowing the efficient and rapid diversification of these core structures and fine&#8208;tuning of gel properties.

         <title>Luminescent Chiral Exciplexes with Sky&#8208;Blue and Green Circularly Polarized&#8208;Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence</title>

         <dc:description>
The design of circularly polarized and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (CP&#8208;TADF) materials based on a chiral luminescent exciplex strategy is explored based on a chiral donor and different achiral acceptor units. This approach leads to CP&#8208;TADF properties with glum up to 7&#215;10&#8722;3 and straightforward color tuning by playing with the energy level of the achiral acceptor while keeping the same chiral donor unit. These results bring new (inter)molecular guidelines to obtain simply and efficiently multi&#8208;color CP&#8208;TADF emitters.







Abstract
Luminescent exciplexes based on a chiral electron donor and achiral acceptors are reported as a new approach to design circularly polarized (CP) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters. This strategy results in rather high CP luminescence (CPL) values with glum up to 7&#215;10&#8722;3, one order of magnitude higher in comparison to the CPL signal recorded for the chiral donor alone (glum &#8764;7&#215;10&#8722;4). This increase occurs concomitantly with a CPL sign inversion, as a result of the strong charge&#8208;transfer emission character, as experimentally and theoretically rationalized by using a covalent chiral donor&#8208;acceptor model. Interestingly, blue, green&#8208;yellow and red chiral luminescent exciplexes can be obtained by modifying with the electron accepting character of the achiral unit while keeping the same chiral donor unit. These results bring new (inter)molecular guidelines to obtain simply and efficiently multi&#8208;color CP&#8208;TADF emitters.

The analysis revealed a correlation between the molecular structure of the adducts and NMR parameters, including not only isotropic chemical shifts, but also the other chemical shift tensor components. It was observed that the structural and electronic properties of adducts are different in the solid and liquid states. The discrepancy was interpreted with the help of X&#8208;ray crystallography and quantum chemical calculations.







Abstract
N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands (NHC) are widely utilized in catalysis and material science. They are characterized by their steric and electronic properties. Steric properties are usually quantified on the basis of their static structure, which can be determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction. The electronic properties are estimated in the liquid state; for example, via the 77Se liquid state NMR of Se&#8208;NHC adducts. We demonstrate that 77Se NMR crystallography can contribute to the characterization of the structural and electronic properties of NHC in solid and liquid states. Selected Se&#8208;NHC adducts are investigated via 77Se solid state NMR and X&#8208;ray crystallography, supported by quantum chemical calculations. This investigation reveals a correlation between the molecular structure of adducts and NMR parameters, including not only isotropic chemical shifts but also the other chemical shift tensor components. Afterwards, the liquid state 77Se NMR data is presented and interpreted in terms of the quantum chemistry modelling. The discrepancy between the structural and electronic properties, and in particular the &#960;&#8208;accepting abilities of adducts in the solid and liquid states is discussed. Finally, the 13C isotropic chemical shift from the liquid state NMR and the 13C tensor components are also discussed, and compared with their 77Se counterparts. 77Se NMR crystallography can deliver valuable information about NHC ligands, and together with liquid state 77Se NMR can provide an in&#8208;depth outlook on the properties of NHC ligands.

Synthesis analysis: A series of novel metal&#8211;organic frameworks with lanthanide double&#8208;layer&#8208;based inorganic subnetworks (KGF&#8208;3) has been synthesized assisted by machine learning. The synthetic conditions were successfully optimized by extracting the dominant factors for KGF&#8208;3 synthesis by using two machine&#8208;learning techniques; cluster analysis and decision&#8208;tree analysis. KGF&#8208;3 possesses unique hydrophilic pores, and impedance measurements demonstrated good proton conductivities at high temperature (363&#8197;K) and a relative humidity of 95&#8201;% RH.







Abstract
Novel metal&#8211;organic frameworks containing lanthanide double&#8208;layer&#8208;based secondary building units (KGF&#8208;3) were synthesized by using machine learning (ML). Isolating pure KGF&#8208;3 was challenging, and the synthesis was not reproducible because impurity phases were frequently obtained under the same synthetic conditions. Thus, dominant factors for the synthesis of KGF&#8208;3 were identified, and its synthetic conditions were optimized by using two ML techniques. Cluster analysis was used to classify the obtained powder X&#8208;ray diffractometry patterns of the products and thus automatically determine whether the experiments were successful. Decision&#8208;tree analysis was used to visualize the experimental results, after extracting factors that mainly affected the synthetic reproducibility. Water&#8208;adsorption isotherms revealed that KGF&#8208;3 possesses unique hydrophilic pores. Impedance measurements demonstrated good proton conductivities (&#963;=5.2&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 for KGF&#8208;3(Y)) at a high temperature (363&#8197;K) and relative humidity of 95&#8201;% RH.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Phonon Coupling and Slow&#8208;Magnetic Relaxation in Pristine Ferrocenium</title>

         <dc:description>
Ferrocenium complexes show slow spin relaxation due to an unusual non&#8208;Aufbau orbital occupation. An external field is required for such behavior but magnetic dilution results in a considerable decrease of the field required. The energy of the first calculated vibrational mode agrees with the fitted value obtained from the local&#8208;mode contribution of the experimental spin relaxation times.







Abstract
We report the spin dynamic properties of non&#8208;substituted ferrocenium complexes. Ferrocenium shows a field&#8208;induced single&#8208;molecule magnet behaviour in DMF solution while cobaltocene lacks slow spin relaxation neither in powder nor in solution. Multireference quantum mechanical calculations give a non&#8208;Aufbau orbital occupation for ferrocenium with small first excitation energy that agrees with the relatively large measured magnetic anisotropy for a transition metal S=1/2 system. The analysis of the spin relaxation shows an important participation of quantum tunnelling, Raman, direct and local&#8208;mode mechanisms which depend on temperature and the external field conditions. The calculation of spin&#8208;phonon coupling constants for the vibrational modes shows that the first vibrational mode, despite having a low spin&#8208;phonon constant, is the most efficient process for the spin relaxation at low temperatures. In such conditions, vibrational modes with higher spin&#8208;phonon coupling constants are not populated. Additionally, the vibrational energy of this first mode is in excellent agreement with the experimental fitted value obtained from the local&#8208;mode mechanism.

</title>

Transition metal tetrylenes offer new ways for chemical cooperation with great prospects for catalysis. Here we report on an unusual naked rhodium(I) site that is embraced by a bulky germylene in a pincer&#8208;like fashion. Cooperation across the Rh&#8722;Ge motif is illustrated by up to three C&#8722;H activation events, along with hydride and formal alkyl migrations between the two sites.







Abstract
Transition metal tetrylene complexes offer great opportunities for molecular cooperation due to the ambiphilic character of the group 14 element. Here we focus on the coordination of germylene [(ArMes2)2Ge&#8201;:] (ArMes=C6H3&#8208;2,6&#8208;(C6H2&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;Me3)2) to [RhCl(COD)]2 (COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene), which yields a neutral germyl complex in which the rhodium center exhibits both &#951;6&#8208; and &#951;2&#8208;coordination to two mesityl rings in an unusual pincer&#8208;type structure. Chloride abstraction from this species triggers a singular dehydrogenative double C&#8722;H bond activation across the Ge/Rh motif. We have isolated and fully characterized three rhodium&#8208;germyl species associated to three C&#8722;H cleavage events along this process. The reaction mechanism has been further investigated by computational means, supporting the key cooperative action of rhodium and germanium centers.

         <title>CdS Reinforced with CoSX/NiCo&#8208;LDH Core&#8208;shell Co&#8208;catalyst Demonstrate High Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution and Durability in Anhydrous Ethanol</title>

         <dc:description>
The new core&#8208;shell structured co&#8208;catalyst CoSX/NiCo&#8208;LDH and CdS are coupled by electrostatic self&#8208;assembly to form a composite catalyst 3&#8201;%Co/NiCo/CdS, which exhibits high&#8208;efficiency hydrogen evolution performance and stability under visible light (&#955;&#8805;420&#8197;nm). CoSX/NiCo&#8208;LDH provides sufficient space for the effective load of CdS. Meanwhile, the effective interface contact accelerates the transfer of electrons and jointly promotes the precipitation of hydrogen.







Abstract
At present, inefficient charge separation of single photocatalyst impedes the development of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

&lt;p&gt;The new core-shell structured co-catalyst CoS&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;/NiCo-LDH and CdS are coupled by electrostatic self-assembly to form a composite catalyst 3&#8201;%Co/NiCo/CdS, which exhibits high-efficiency hydrogen evolution performance and stability under visible light (&#955;&#8805;420&#8197;nm). CoS&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;/NiCo-LDH provides sufficient space for the effective load of CdS. Meanwhile, the effective interface contact accelerates the transfer of electrons and jointly promotes the precipitation of hydrogen.

         <title>Synthesis and Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Patterns of Aryl&#8208;Group Substituted Silanediols and &#8208;triols from Alkoxy&#8208; and Chlorosilanes</title>

         <dc:description>
Stable and isolable silanols with various aromatic substituents (e.&#8201;g., naphthyl or phentanthrenyl) were obtained by hydrolysis of alkoxy&#8208; and chlorosilanes. The resulting compounds exhibit strong hydrogen bonds both in solution and in the solid&#8208;state. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures showed &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions dominating the structures of the non&#8208;hydrolyzed precursor molecules. The resulting crystalline silanols exhibit hydrogen bonding with a variety of structural motifs depending on the substitution pattern on the Si atom.







Abstract
Organosilanols typically show a high condensation tendency and only exist as stable isolable molecules under very specific steric and electronic conditions at the silicon atom. In the present work, various novel representatives of this class of compounds were synthesized by hydrolysis of alkoxy&#8208; or chlorosilanes. Phenyl, 1&#8208;naphthyl, and 9&#8208;phenanthrenyl substituents at the silicon atom were applied to systematically study the influence of the aromatic substituents on the structure and reactivity of the compounds. Chemical shifts in 29Si NMR spectroscopy in solution, correlated well with the expected electronic situation induced by the substitution pattern on the Si atom. 1H NMR studies allowed the detection of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures of the alkoxides and the chlorosilanes are dominated by &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions of the aromatic systems, which are substituted by strong hydrogen bonding interactions representing various structural motifs in the respective silanol structures.

         <title>Insertion Chemistry of Lutetacyclopropene toward Unsaturated C&#8722;O/C&#8722;N Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 66, Page 16498-16504, November 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diversified and unique reactivity of lutetacyclopropene toward ketone, aldehyde, tungsten hexacarbonyl, imine, and carbodiimide was demonstrated to give a series of novel lutetacycles, including oxalutetacyclopentenes, metallacyclic lutetoxycarbene, azalutetacyclopentene, lutetium pinacolate, as well as an acyclic complex with a diamidinate ligand. The intrinsic reactivity of lutetacyclopropene was probably caused by the strongly nucleophilic and high polarized nature of Lu&#8722;Csp2 bonds.







Abstract
Although the reaction chemistry of transition metallacyclopropenes has been well&#8208;established in the last decades, the reactivity of rare&#8208;earth metallacyclopropenes remains elusive. Herein, we report the reaction of lutetacyclopropene 1 toward a series of unsaturated molecules. The reaction of 1 with one equiv. of PhCOMe, Ar1CHO (Ar1=2,6&#8208;Me2C6H3), W(CO)6, and PhCH=NPh provided oxalutetacyclopentenes, metallacyclic lutetoxycarbene, and azalutetacyclopentene via 1,2&#8208;insertion of C=O, C&#8801;O, or C=N bonds into Lu&#8722;Csp2 bond, respectively. However, the reaction between 1 and Ar2N=C=NAr2 (Ar2=4&#8208;MeC6H4) gave an acyclic lutetium complex with a diamidinate ligand by the coupling of one molecule of 1 with two carbodiimides, irrespective of the amount of carbodiimide employed. More interestingly, when 1 was treated with two equiv. of Ar1CHO, the reductive coupling of two C=O bonds was discovered to give a lutetium pinacolate complex along with the release of tolan. Remarkably, the reactivity of 1 is significantly different from that of scandacyclopropenes; these metallacycles derived from 1 all represent the first cases in rare&#8208;earth organometallic chemistry.

         <title>Photochemical Hydrogen Evolution at Metal Centers Probed with Hydrated Aluminium Cations, Al+(H2O)n, n=1&#8211;10</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 66, Page 16367-16376, November 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A complex sequence of events, including intersystem crossing to the triplet surface and electron transfer, is involved in photochemical hydrogen evolution in Al+(H2O)n. For two water molecules, high&#8208;level calculations reveal a scenario for atomic hydrogen formation in which the system passes through a conical intersection between the two lowest&#8208;lying triplet states, and the hydrogen atom is virtually ejected while the remaining hydrated aluminium hydroxide cation relaxes to its new equilibrium geometry.







Abstract
Hydrated aluminium cations have been investigated as a photochemical model system with up to ten water molecules by UV action spectroscopy in a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT&#8208;ICR) mass spectrometer. Intense photodissociation was observed starting at 4.5&#8197;eV for two to eight water molecules with loss of atomic hydrogen, molecular hydrogen and water molecules. Quantum chemical calculations for n=2 reveal that solvation shifts the intense 3s&#8211;3p excitations of Al+ into the investigated photon energy range below 5.5&#8197;eV. During the photochemical relaxation, internal conversion from S1 to T2 takes place, and photochemical hydrogen formation starts on the T2 surface, which passes through a conical intersection, changing to T1. On this triplet surface, the electron that was excited to the Al 3p orbital is transferred to a coordinated water molecule, which dissociates into a hydroxide ion and a hydrogen atom. If the system remains in the triplet state, this hydrogen radical is lost directly. If the system returns to singlet multiplicity, the reaction may be reversed, with recombination with the hydroxide moiety and electron transfer back to aluminium, resulting in water evaporation. Alternatively, the hydrogen radical can attack the intact water molecule, forming molecular hydrogen and aluminium dihydroxide. Photodissociation is observed for up to n=8. Clusters with n=9 or 10 occur exclusively as HAlOH+(H2O)n&#8208;1 and are transparent in the investigated energy range. For n=4&#8211;8, a mixture of Al+(H2O)n and HAlOH+(H2O)n&#8208;1 is present in the experiment.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with Novel Catenane&#8208;like Interlocking: Metal&#8208;Determined Photoresponse and Uranyl Sensing</title>

Organo&#8208;originated and metal&#8208;modulated photoresponsive properties were elucidated for a family of isostructural MOFs with tripyridinium&#8208;tricarboxylate likers. Supramolecular entanglement between 2D networks dictates electron donor&#8208;acceptor close contacts, which not only allow photoluminescence through interligand charge&#8208;transfer excitation/emission but also cause photochromism through photoinduced electron transfer. Transition metal centers can weaken or prevent the photoresponsive properties because of energy transfer through d&#8208;d transitions. The MOFs also show highly sensitive and selective fluorescence quenching response to UO22+ in water.







Abstract
The assembly of two tripyridinium&#8208;tricarboxylate ligands and different metal ions leads to seven isostructural MOFs, which show novel 2D&#8594;2D supramolecular entanglement featuring catenane&#8208;like interlocking of tricyclic cages. The MOFs show tripyridinium&#8208;afforded and metal&#8208;modulated photoresponsive properties. The MOFs with d10 metal centers (1&#8208;Cd, 1&#8208;Zn, 2&#8208;Cd, 2&#8208;Zn) show fast and reversible photochromism and concomitant fluorescence quenching, 1&#8208;Ni displays slower photochromism but does not fluoresce, and 1&#8208;Co and 2&#8208;Co are neither photochromic nor fluorescent. It is shown here that the network entanglement dictates donor&#8208;acceptor close contacts, which enable fluorescence originated from interligand charge transfer. The contacts also allow photoinduced electron transfer, which underlies photochromism and concomitant fluorescence response. The metal dependence in fluorescence and photochromism can be related to energy transfer through metal&#8208;centered d&#8208;d transitions. In addition, 1&#8208;Cd is demonstrated to be a potential fluorescence sensor for sensitive and selective detection of UO22+ in water.

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Structural Analysis of Glucocerebrosidase Imaging Agents</title>

Tagged cyclophellitols offer a powerful activity&#8208;based probe (ABP) approach to the study of glycosidase activities. Here, a range of cyclophellitol epoxide and aziridine inhibitors and ABPs were synthesised and investigated on the 3D structure of human &#946;&#8208;glucocerebrosidase (GBA), demonstrating their mechanism&#8208;based mode of action. We envisage these inactivators will serve useful in the study of GBA in relation to Gaucher Disease.







Abstract
Gaucher disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by inherited deficiencies in &#946;&#8208;glucocerebrosidase (GBA). Current treatments require rapid disease diagnosis and a means of monitoring therapeutic efficacy, both of which may be supported by the use of GBA&#8208;targeting activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs). Here, we report the synthesis and structural analysis of a range of cyclophellitol epoxide and aziridine inhibitors and ABPs for GBA. We demonstrate their covalent mechanism&#8208;based mode of action and uncover binding of the new N&#8208;functionalised aziridines to the ligand binding cleft. These inhibitors became scaffolds for the development of ABPs; the O6&#8208;fluorescent tags of which bind in an allosteric site at the dimer interface. Considering GBA's preference for O6&#8208; and N&#8208;functionalised reagents, a bi&#8208;functional aziridine ABP was synthesized as a potentially more powerful imaging agent. Whilst this ABP binds to two unique active site clefts of GBA, no further benefit in potency was achieved over our first generation ABPs. Nevertheless, such ABPs should serve useful in the study of GBA in relation to GD and inform the design of future probes.

Cyclodimers and cyclotrimers of 2,3&#8208;bisalkynylated anthracenes, phenanzines and diazatetracenes were synthesized through Glaser coupling. They display comparable optoelectronic properties but differ dramatically with respect to their solid&#8208;state packing. Intermolecular interactions are fundamental for charge transfer in thin film transistors, and the diazatetracene trimer exhibits charge transfer mobilities an order of magnitude higher than its dimeric congener.

More complex than expected: Photochemical hydrogen evolution in Al+(H2O)n involves conical intersections, multiple intersystem crossings between singlet and triplet surfaces, and electron transfer. Three neutral photoproducts are observed&#8212;hydrogen atoms, hydrogen molecules, and water. For the Al+(H2O)2 cluster, we show how a hydrogen radical is ejected and dictates reactivity. Our results underline the multitude of pathways in photochemistry of these seemingly simple ions. More information can be found in the Full Paper by M. On&#269;&#225;k, M.&#8197;K. Beyer et&#8197;al.

         <title>Cover Feature: Tunable Synchronicity of Molecular Valence Tautomerism with Macroscopic Solid&#8208;Liquid Transition by Molecular Lattice Engineering (Chem. Eur. J. 66/2021)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 66, Page 16272-16272, November 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Changing the length of the side chains in a series of cobalt complexes changed the melting temperature and allowed the synchronicity of the valence tautomerism and solid&#8211;liquid transition to be controlled. The three complexes exhibit distinct macroscopic transitions from the crystalline phase to violet, blueish, or green liquids; this is represented in the figure by the degree of hand&#8208;holding between the two children jumping in the lavender field. More information can be found in the Full Paper by H.&#8208;C. Chang et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103090).

The core&#8208;shell architecture has been recognized as one of the most promising solutions to enable higher silicon content in Li&#8208;ion anodes. In this review, we report different types of coatings on silicon particles including carbon, inorganic, organic and double&#8208;layer shells from some selected examples. The synthesis methods, structure characterization, main properties and resulting electrochemical performance are outlined. Improvements over silicon are decrypted and trends for future works are objectively identified.







Abstract
The amount of silicon in anode materials for Li&#8208;ion batteries is still limited by the huge volume changes during charge&#8208;discharge cycles. Such changes lead to the loss of electrical contacts, as well as mechanical and surface electrolyte interphase (SEI) instabilities, strongly reducing the cycle life. Core&#8208;shell structures have attracted a vast research interest due to the possibility of modifying some properties with a judicious choice of the shell. It is, for example, possible to improve the electronic conductivity and ionic diffusion, or buffer volume variations. This review gives a comprehensive overview of the recent developments and the different strategies used for the design, synthesis and electrochemical performance of silicon&#8208;based core&#8208;shells. It is based on a selection of the main types of silicon coatings reported in the literature, including carbon, inorganic, organic and double&#8208;layer coatings, Finally, a summary of the advantages and drawbacks of these different types of core&#8208;shells as anode materials for Li&#8208;ion batteries and some insightful suggestions in regards to their use are provided.

         <title>On the Roles of Electron Transfer in Catalysis by Nanoclusters and Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 66, Page 16291-16308, November 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The various roles and functions of electron transfer in nanocatalysis, from H2 generation to materials and sustainable energy production, are all the more crucial and better managed as heterogeneous catalysts (nanoparticles and nanoclusters) now increasingly involve well&#8208;defined atomic and molecular components. The various aspects discussed in this minireview include NC&#8211;NPs as electron reservoirs, hydrogen production from water photocatalysis, electron&#8208;transfer&#8208;chain catalysis, Ullmann coupling, plasmonic hot electrons in photocatalysis, and, briefly, redox/electrocatalysis in energy conversion, water depollution and sustainable chemistry.







Abstract
Electron transfer plays a major role in chemical reactions and processes, and this is particularly true of catalysis by nanomaterials. The advent of metal nanoparticle (NP) catalysts, recently including atomically precise nanoclusters (NCs) as parts of nanocatalyst devices has brought increased control of the relationship between NP and NC structures and their catalytic functions. Consequently, the molecular definition of these new nanocatalysts has allowed a better understanding and management of various kinds of electron transfer involved in the catalytic processes. This Minireview brings a chemist&#8216;s view of several major aspects of electron&#8208;transfer functions concerning NPs and NCs in catalytic processes. Particular focus concerns the role of NPs and NCs as electron reservoirs and light&#8208;induced antenna in catalytic processes from H2 generation to more complex reactions and sustainable energy production.

         <title>The Photophysics and Photochemistry of Melanin&#8208; Like Nanomaterials Depend on Morphology and Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 66, Page 16309-16319, November 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Melanin&#8208;like materials can be easily prepared from simple precursors upon controlled oxidation/polymerization. In the resulting system, species with different structure and morphology coexist and interact. The overall photophysical and photochemical properties depend in part on the nature of the chromophores formed but also, to a large extent, on the interchromophoric interactions as typical for supramolecular architectures.







Abstract
Melanin&#8208;like nanomaterials have found application in a large variety of high economic and social impact fields as medicine, energy conversion and storage, photothermal catalysis and environmental remediation. These materials have been used mostly for their optical and electronic properties, but also for their high biocompatibility and simplicity and versatility of preparation. Beside this, their chemistry is complex and it yields structures with different molecular weight and composition ranging from oligomers, to polymers as well as nanoparticles (NP). The comprehension of the correlation of the different compositions and morphologies to the optical properties of melanin is still incomplete and challenging, even if it is fundamental also from a technological point of view. In this minireview we focus on scientific papers, mostly recent ones, that indeed examine the link between composition and structural feature and photophysical and photochemical properties proposing this approach as a general one for future research.

         <title>Cyclodimers and Cyclotrimers of 2,3&#8201;&#8208;Bisalkynylated Anthracenes, Phenazines and Diazatetracenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 66, Page 16320-16324, November 25, 2021. </description>

Upwardly mobile: Glaser&#8208;Hay coupling of ortho&#8208;bisethynylated (aza)acenes furnishes Eglinton&#8208;Gailbrath&#8208;type cyclodimers and cyclotrimers. Although conjugation between the chromophores is poor through the diyne bridges, as evidenced by UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy, the azatetracene&#8208;based trimer exhibits electron mobilities one order of magnitude higher than its dimeric congener.







Abstract
The synthesis of novel (N&#8722;)acene&#8208;based cyclooligomers is reported. Glaser&#8208;Hay coupling of the bisethynylated monomers results in cyclodimers and cyclotrimers that are separable by column and gel&#8208;permeation chromatographies. For the diazatetracene, the use of sec&#8208;butyl&#8208;silylethynyl groups is necessary to achieve solubility. Diazatetracene&#8208;based cyclodimers and cyclotrimers were used as semiconductors in thin&#8208;film transistors. Although their optoelectronic properties are quite similar, their electron mobilities in proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept thin&#8208;film transistors differ by an order of magnitude.

         <title>Donor&#8208;Stabilised [SbF4]+: SbF5 as a Fluoride&#8208;Ion Donor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 66, Page 16334-16337, November 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ability of the strong Lewis acid SbF5 to act as a fluoride&#8208;ion donor has been demonstrated for the first time through the synthesis of donor&#8208;stabilised [SbF4]+ cations. In the presence of bidentate N&#8208;donor ligands, SbF5 undergoes ligand&#8208;induced autoionisation to yield robust [SbF4(L&#8722;L)]+ (L&#8722;L=2,2&#8217;bipyridine or 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline) salts. DFT calculations and NBO analyses show strong Sb&#8722;N interactions that are necessary to stabilise the [SbF4]+ cation.







Abstract
Antimony pentafluoride is a strong Lewis acid and fluoride&#8208;ion acceptor that has not previously demonstrated any discreet fluoride&#8208;ion donor properties. The first donor&#8208;stabilised [SbF4]+ cations were prepared from the autoionisation of SbF5 in the presence of bidentate N&#8208;donor ligands 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (bipy) and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (phen) as their [SbF6]&#8722; salts. The [SbF4(N&#8722;N)][Sb2F11] (N&#8722;N=bipy, phen) salts were synthesised by the addition of one equivalent of SbF5&#8901;SO2 to [SbF4(N&#8722;N)][SbF6] in liquid SO2. The salts show remarkable stability and were characterised by Raman spectroscopy and multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. The crystal structures of [SbF4(phen)][SbF6]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3CH3CN and [SbF4(phen)][SbF6]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2SO2 were determined, showing distorted octahedral cations. DFT calculations and NBO analyses reveal that significant degree of electron&#8208;pair donation from N to Sb stabilizes [SbF4]+ with the Sb&#8722;N bond strength being approximately two thirds of that of the Sb&#8722;F bonds in these cations and the cationic charge being primarily ligand&#8208;centred.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Indoline from Achiral Phthalimide Involving Crystallization&#8208;Induced Deracemization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 66, Page 16338-16341, November 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric synthesis was performed by combining a photochemical reaction of an achiral substrate followed by crystallization&#8208;induced deracemization. A fused indoline produced by the photochemical intramolecular &#948;&#8208;hydrogen abstraction and cyclization reaction of N&#8208;(5&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;methylphenyl)phthalimide crystallized as a racemic conglomerate, and crystallization&#8208;induced deracemization by Viedma ripening was performed with an excellent enantioselectivity of 99&#8201;% ee. This is the first example of asymmetric expression and amplification by a photochemical hydrogen abstraction reaction and crystallization&#8208;induced deracemization.







Abstract
Asymmetric synthesis was performed by combining the photochemical reaction of an achiral substrate followed by crystallization&#8208;induced deracemization.

         <title>Thermal Expansion Properties and Mechanochemical Synthesis of Stoichiometric Cocrystals Containing Tetrabromobenzene as a Hydrogen&#8208; and Halogen&#8208;Bond Donor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 66, Page 16329-16333, November 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermal expansion defines by composition: Cocrystals containing different stoichiometric ratios of the components 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrabromobenzene (TBrB) and 4,4&#8242;&#8208;azobipyridine (Azo) exhibit dramatically different thermal expansion (TE) behaviors. The components in the stoichiometric cocrystals interact through hydrogen or hydrogen/halogen bonds and differ in &#960;&#8208;stacking arrangements. The structural differences results in the unique TE behaviors for each solid. The cocrystals form concomitantly, and mechanochemical synthesis demonstrates that mixtures or pure phases can be synthesized by varying the feed ratios of the components.







Abstract
The solution and mechanochemical synthesis of two cocrystals that differ in the stoichiometric ratio of the components (stoichiometric cocrystals) is reported. The components in the stoichiometric cocrystals interact through hydrogen or hydrogen/halogen bonds and differ in &#960;&#8208;stacking arrangements. The difference in structure and noncovalent interactions affords dramatically different thermal expansion behaviors in the two cocrystals. At certain molar ratios, the cocrystals are obtained concomitantly; however, by varying the ratios, a single stoichiometric cocrystal is achieved using mechanochemistry.

         <title>A Benzodiphosphaborolediide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 66, Page 16342-16346, November 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 1,3&#8208;diphosphaborolediide ligand motif, a hitherto missing member of the &#8220;hetero&#8208;Cp&#8220; family, is obtained within an indenyl scaffold as its dilithium salt, as both thf and TMEDA solvates. This dianionic ligand exhibits aromaticity commensurate with its hybrid phospholide&#8208;borolediide nature, as is determined by NICS calculations and observed experimentally for both lithium salts. Additionally, coordination to zero&#8208;valent molybdenum is achieved, demonstrating a capacity to to coordinate readily as a &#960;&#8208; and bridging &#960;&#8208;,&#963;&#8208;type ligand.







Abstract
The first example of a diphosphaborolediide, the benzo&#8208;fused [C6H4P2BPh]2&#8722; (12&#8722;), is prepared from ortho&#8208;bis(phosphino)benzene (C6H4{PH2}) and dichlorophenylborane, via a sequential lithiation approach. The dilithio&#8208;salt can be obtained as an oligomeric THF solvate or discrete TMEDA adduct, both of which are fully characterized, including by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Alongside NICS calculations, data strongly suggest some aromaticity within 12&#8722;, which is further supported by preliminary coordination studies that demonstrate &#951;5&#8208;coordination to a zerovalent molybdenum center, as observed crystallographically for the oligomeric [{Mo(CO)3(&#951;5&#8208;1)}{&#956;&#8208;&#951;1&#8208;Mo(CO)3(TMEDA)}2]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;[&#956;&#8208;Li(THF)][&#956;&#8208;Li(TMEDA)].

Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethyl azocanes are accessible from 2&#8208;(trifluoropropan&#8208;2&#8208;ol) piperidines by metal&#8208;free ring&#8208;expansion involving a bicyclic azetidinium intermediate. The opening of the azetidinium intermediate was achieved by various nucleophiles (amines, alcoholates, carboxylates, phosphonates, halides and pseudo&#8208;halides) with an excellent regio&#8208; diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity and in good yields. The relative configuration of the piperidines and azocanes were assigned and the deprotected azocanes offer opportunities for further derivatization.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Perfluoroalkylation of Heteroarenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient and broadly applicable process is reported for the copper&#8208;catalyzed direct perfluoroalkylation of C&#8208;H bonds in heteroarenes with commercially available perfluoroalkyl iodides. This reaction is based on a simple combination of copper(I) iodide and phenanthroline enabling the easy reduction of perfluoroalkyl iodides to the corresponding radical species that add to a wide range of heteroarenes including benzofurans, benzothiophenes, (aza)indoles, furans and pyrroles. High levels of regioselectivity were obtained in all cases and the efficiency and robustness of this process was highlighted by the direct perfluoroalkylation of furan&#8208;containing peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>Photobase&#8208;Driven Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer (ESIPT) in a Strapped &#960;&#8208;Electron System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a new design strategy for an excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) fluorophore that can be used in acidic media. A photobasic pyridine&#8208;centered donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor&#8208;type fluorophore is combined with a basic trialkylamine &#8220;strap&#8221;. In the presence of an acid, protonation occurs predominantly at the amine moiety in the ground state. A single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis confirmed the formation of a pre&#8208;organized intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonded structure between the resulting ammonium moiety and the pyridine ring. Upon excitation, the intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer transition increases the basicity of the pyridine moiety in the excited state, resulting in proton transfer from the amine to the pyridine moiety. Consequently, the fluorophore takes on a polymethine&#8208;dye character in the ESIPT state, which gives rise to significantly red&#8208;shifted emission with an increased fluorescence quantum yield.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly stable univalent copper of Cu@Al/SBA&#8208;15 nanocomposite catalyzed the synthesis of novel aminobenzotriazoles derivatives and their fluorescence properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the development of green chemistry, it is still a challenge to maintain the unstable valence state of the metal in heterogeneous catalysts and realize new catalytic synthesis methods. In this paper, it was reported that an univalent copper nanocomposite (Cu@Al/SBA&#8208;15) could efficiently catalyze the formation of novel amino&#8208;containing benzotriazoles with great fluorescence properties in a new synthetic strategy. Subsequently, its application was further verified by acylation reaction to produce a series of novel benzotriazoles derivatives with high yield. It was worth noting that Cu@Al/SBA&#8208;15 nanocomposites not only enable the reaction completed with high yield in a short time, but also could be recycled many times without a significant reduction in activity, and the leaching of copper and aluminum species in reaction system was negligible. Finally, the detailed and feasible reaction mechanism was also provided.</dc:description>

         <title>Mild Microfluidic Approaches to Oxide Nanoparticles Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxide nanoparticles (oxide NPs) are advanced materials with a wide variety of applications in different fields. The use of continuous flow methods is particularly appealing for their synthesis due to the high control achieved over the reaction conditions and the easy process scalability. This review focuses on the preparation of oxide NPs using microfluidic setups at low temperature (&#8804; 80&#176;C), since the employment of mild reaction conditions is crucial for developing sustainable and cost&#8208;effective processes. A particular emphasis will be put on the improvement over the final product features (  e.g.  , size, shape, and size distribution) given by flow methods with respect to conventional batch procedures. The main issues that arise by treating NPs suspensions in microfluidic systems are product deposition or channel clogging; mitigation strategies to overcome these drawbacks will also be presented and discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Ruthenium Complexes Bearing Axially Chiral Bipyridyls: The Mismatched Diastereomer Showed Red Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>RutheniumII  &#160;complexes bearing three axially chiral bipyridyl ligands were synthesized as a new family of chiral complex dyes, and &#916;&#8208;(S)&#8208; and &#923;&#8208;(S)&#8208;diastereomers were obtained.

         <title>Carboboration&#8208;Driven Generation of a Silylium Ion for Vinylic C&#8211;F Bond Functionalization by B(C6F5)3 Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strong main&#8208;group Lewis acids such as silylium ions are known to effectively promote heterolytic C(sp3)&#8211;F bond cleavage. However, carrying out the C(sp2)&#8211;F bond transformation of vinylic C&#8211; F bonds has remained an unmet challenge. Herein, we describe our development of a new and simple strategy for vinylic C&#8211;F bond transformation of &#945;&#8208;fluorostyrenes with silyl ketene acetals catalyzed by B(C6F5)3 under mild conditions. Our theoretical calculations revealed that a stabilized silylium ion, which is generated from silyl ketene acetals by carboboration, cleaves the C&#8211;F bond of &#945;fluorostyrenes. A comparative study of &#945;&#8208;chloro or bromostyrenes demonstrated that our reaction can be applied only to &#945;fluorostyrenes because the strong silicon&#8208;fluorine affinity facilitates an intramolecular interaction of silylium ions with fluorine atom to cleave the C&#8211;F bond. A broad range of &#945;&#8208;fluorostyrenes as well as a range of silyl ketene acetals underwent this C&#8211;F bond transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Carrier Protein&#8208;Free Enzymatic Biaryl Coupling in Arylomycin A2 Assembly and Structure of the Cytochrome P450 AryC**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The arylomycins are antibiotic natural products that inhibit bacterial signal peptidase. Within this work, the biaryl&#8208;bond forming cytochrome P450 of arylomycin biosynthesis, AryC, is structurally and functionally characterized. Convergent preparation of the linear lipopeptide precursor followed by enzymatic installation of the biaryl structural element by AryC results in a streamlined chemo&#8208;enzymatic access to arylomycin A2. Unlike oxidative cross&#8208;coupling enzymes in glycopeptide biosynthesis, AryC accepts carrier protein&#8208;free peptide substrates, a tremendous advantage for future biocatalytic applications in complex peptide synthesis.







Abstract
The arylomycin antibiotics are potent inhibitors of bacterial type I signal peptidase. These lipohexapeptides contain a biaryl structural motif reminiscent of glycopeptide antibiotics. We herein describe the functional and structural evaluation of AryC, the cytochrome P450 performing biaryl coupling in biosynthetic arylomycin assembly. Unlike its enzymatic counterparts in glycopeptide biosynthesis, AryC converts free substrates without the requirement of any protein interaction partner, likely enabled by a strongly hydrophobic cavity at the surface of AryC pointing to the substrate tunnel. This activity enables chemo&#8208;enzymatic assembly of arylomycin A2 that combines the advantages of liquid&#8208; and solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis with late&#8208;stage enzymatic cross&#8208;coupling. The reactivity of AryC is unprecedented in cytochrome P450&#8208;mediated biaryl construction in non&#8208;ribosomal peptides, in which peptidyl carrier protein (PCP)&#8208;tethering so far was shown crucial both in&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;vitro.

         <title>Coordination cage&#8208;based emulsifiers: templated formation of metal oxide microcapsules monitored by in situ LC&#8208;TEM</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metallo&#8208;supramolecular self&#8208;assembly has yielded a plethora of discrete&#160;nanosystems, many of which show competence in capturing guests and catalyzing chemical reactions. However, the potential of low&#8208;molecular bottom&#8208;up self&#8208;assemblies in the development of structured inorganic materials has rarely been methodically explored so far. Herein, we present a new type of metallo&#8208;supramolecular surfactant with the ability to stabilize non&#8208;aqueous emulsions for a significant period. The molecular design of the surfactant is based on a heteroleptic coordination cage (  CGA&#8208;3  ;  CGA  = Cage&#8208;based Gemini Amphiphile), assembled from two pairs of organic building blocks, grouped around two Pd(II) cations. Shape&#8208;complementarity between the differently functionalized components generates discrete amphiphiles with a tailor&#8208;made polarity profile, able to stabilize non&#8208;aqueous emulsions, such as hexadecane&#8208;in&#8208;DMSO. These emulsions were used as a medium for the synthesis of spherical metal oxide microcapsules (titanium oxide, zirconium oxide, and niobium oxide) from soluble, water&#8208;sensitive alkoxide precursors by allowing a controlled dosage of water to the liquid&#8208;liquid phase boundary. Synthesized materials were analyzed by a combination of electron microscopic techniques.  In situ  liquid cell transmission electron microscopy (LC&#8208;TEM) was utilized for the first time to visualize the dynamics of the emulsion&#8208;templated formation of hollow inorganic titanium oxide and zirconium oxide microspheres.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanism&#8208;Based Approach to Reagent Selection for Oxidative Carbon&#8211;Hydrogen Bond Cleavage Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Numerous hydride&#8208;abstracting agents generate the same cationic intermediate, but substrate features such as intermediate cation stability, oxidation potential, and steric environment can influence reaction rates in an oxidant&#8208;dependent manner. This manuscript provides experimental data to illustrate the role that structural features play in the kinetics of hydride abstraction reactions with commonly used quinone&#8208;, oxoammonium ion&#8208;, and carbocation&#8208; based oxidants. Computational studies of the transition state structures and energies explain these results and energy decomposition analysis calculations reveal unique sensitivities to electrostatic attraction and steric repulsions. Rigorous rate studies of select reactions validated the capacity of the calculations to predict reactivity trends. Additionally, kinetics studies demonstrate the potential for product inhibition in DDQ&#8208;mediated reactions. These studies provide a clear guide to select the optimal oxidant for structurally disparate substrates and lead to predictions of reactivity that were validated experimentally.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Acyclic Stereotriads Featuring Fluorinated Tetrasubstituted Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elaboration of enantioenriched complex acyclic stereotriads represents a challenge for modern synthesis even more when fluorinated tetrasubstituted stereocenters are targeted. We have been able to develop a simple strategy in a sequence of two unprecedented steps combining a diastereoselective aldol&#8208;Tishchenko reaction and an enantioselective organocatalyzed kinetic resolution. The aldol&#8208;Tishchenko reaction generates directly a large panel of acyclic 1,3&#8208;diols possessing a fluorinated tetrasubstituted stereocenter by condensation of fluorinated ketones with aldehydes under very mild basic conditions. The anti 1,3&#8208;diols featuring three contiguous stereogenic centers are generated with excellent diastereocontrol (typically &gt; 99:1 dr ). Depending upon the precursors both diastereomers of stereotriads are accessible through this flexible reaction. Furthermore, from the obtained racemic scaffolds, development of an organocatalyzed kinetic resolution enabled to generate the desired enantioenriched stereotriads with excellent selectivity (typically er &gt; 95:5).</dc:description>

         <title>Helic[6]arene&#8208;Based Chiral Pseudo[1]rotaxanes and [1]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral pseudo[1]rotaxanes and [1]rotaxanes constructed from macrocyclic arenes still remain a big challenge mainly owing to the lack of such chiral macrocycles. In this work, a new system of chiral pseudo[1]rotaxanes formed by self&#8208;inclusion of helic[6]arene containing amide linked with the terminal tertiary amines was first discovered. Based on an atom&#8208;economic stopping strategy, a pair of chiral [1]rotaxanes were conveniently obtained in almost quantitative yields by blocking the pseudo[1]rotaxanes with monobenzyl bromide of tetraphenylethene. The structures of pseudo[1]rotaxanes and [1]rotaxanes were characterized by 2D NMR spectra in solution, combining with the DFT calculations. The photophysical properties further revealed the efficient chirality transfer of helic[6]arene to the tetraphenylethene moiety, compared to their unthreaded chiral isomers. The discovery of the chiral pseudo[1]rotaxanes allows for a wide and available synthesis of chiral [1]rotaxanes, and also opening a new avenue to the design of chiral supramolecular materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen Bonding Adsorbent Pyridine N&#8208;oxides for Iodine Capture in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonporous crystal materials from one&#8208;step synthesized single component pyridine N&#8208;oxides (2&#8208;((naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)thio)pyridine 1&#8208;oxide: NTPO) for iodine capture in water driven by halogen bond between oxygen atom of NTPO and iodine molecule, along with a single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal transformation process of crystal NTPO to binary cocrystals combined with NTPO and iodine. Besides, the nonporous material NTPO also have great potential in the adsorption of iodine in vapor state and organic solvents (cyclohexane and n&#8208;hexane).







Abstract
Rapid capture of 129I with high volatility and toxicity in the environment has attracted much attention. Herein we reported a firstly synthesized nonporous material: pyridine N&#8208;oxides (NTPO and ATPO) as iodine adsorbent. Both of NTPO and ATPO exhibit remarkable performance on the adsorption of iodine in aqueous solution, vapor state and organic solvents. Upon the capture of iodine, pyridine N&#8208;oxides were transformed to binary cocrystals combined with the pyridine N&#8208;oxides and iodine which is driven by halogen bond between iodine and oxygen atoms. Moreover, pyridine N&#8208;oxides shows high chemical, thermal and moisture stability.

         <title>Molecular Scissors for Tailor&#8208;Made Modification of Siloxane Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic methodology for a tailored design of functional siloxanes is presented. We show that by incorporating molecular scissors into the siloxane framework, the Si&#8722;O&#8722;Si linkage can easily be cleaved at a desired position and siloxy groups exchanged for one another. The method allows also for a direct one&#8208;step cleavage of chlorosiloxanes and shows broad substrate scope, high variability of functional siloxy units, and excellent selectivity.







Abstract
The controlled design of functional oligosiloxanes is an important topic in current research. A consecutive Si&#8722;O&#8722;Si bond cleavage/formation using siloxanes that are substituted with 1,2&#8208;diaminobenzene derivatives acting as molecular scissors is presented. The method allows to cut at certain positions of a siloxane scaffold forming a cyclic diaminosilane or &#8208;siloxane intermediate and then to introduce new functional siloxy units. The procedure could be extended to a direct one&#8208;step cleavage of chlorooligosiloxanes. Both siloxane formation and cleavage proceed with good to excellent yields, high regioselectivity, and great variability of the siloxy units. Control of the selectivity is achieved by the choice of the amino substituent. Insight into the mechanism was provided by low temperature NMR studies and the isolation of a lithiated intermediate.

         <title>Unfused Nonfullerene Acceptors Based on Simple Dipolar Merocyanines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple indole&#8208;based merocyanines have been successfully designed as unfused nonfullerene acceptors for organic solar cells by forming dimers with A&#8722;D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D&#8722;A structure that have a facile synthesis, enhanced photostability compared to well&#8208;known ITIC acceptor, and high electron mobility in blend films. When blended with P3HT donor, one of dimers, i.&#8201;e. Z2, shows a good cell efficiency of 3.53&#8201;%.







Abstract
Merocyanine (MC) dyes exhibit facile synthesis and attractive optical properties, making them widely studied as the donor materials in organic solar cells (OSCs). In this study, for the first time, simple indole&#8208;based MCs are successfully designed as unfused nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) for OSCs by forming dimers with A&#8722;D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D&#8722;A structure, which possess enhanced photostability compared to the well&#8208;known ITIC acceptor and high electron mobility in blend films. When blended with P3HT donor, one of the dimers, i.&#8201;e. Z2, shows a good cell efficiency of 3.53&#8201;%, which outperforms the performance of most of P3HT/NFA blends, particularly for unfused systems, and thus indicates good potential of simple MCs as NFAs.

In this study, for the first time, simple indole-based MCs are successfully designed as unfused nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) for OSCs by forming dimers with A&#8722;D-&#960;-D&#8722;A structure, which possess enhanced photostability compared to the well-known ITIC acceptor and high electron mobility in blend films. When blended with P3HT donor, one of the dimers, i.&#8201;e. Z2, shows a good cell efficiency of 3.53&#8201;%, which outperforms the performance of most of P3HT/NFA blends, particularly for unfused systems, and thus indicates good potential of simple MCs as NFAs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Characterization of Redox Probes Confined in 3D Conducting Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailor&#8208;made 3D conducting polymer networks containing tetraphenylbenzidine redox units are presented as novel platform for the introduction of tunable amounts of additional functional redox species via polymer analogous click chemistry in films. An in&#8208;depth electrochemical characterization based on cyclic voltammetry shows successful covalent immobilization of the redox species within the conducting networks. Ultimately this strategy shall be extended to (photo)electrocatalytic applications which will profit from the conducting polymer matrix as solid support.







Abstract
In this manuscript we present a versatile platform for introducing functional redox species into tailor&#8208;made 3D redox polymer networks. Electrochemical characterization based on cyclic voltammetry is applied to verify the immobilization of the redox species within the conducting networks. Ultimately this strategy shall be extended to (photo)electrocatalytic applications which will profit from the conducting polymer matrix. Soluble precursor copolymers are synthesized via radical copolymerization of vinyltriphenylamine (VTPA) with chloromethylstyrene (CMS) in different ratios, whereas CMS is subsequently converted into azidomethylstyrene (AMS) to yield poly(VTPA&#8208;co&#8208;AMS) copolymers. Spin&#8208;coating of poly(VTPA&#8208;co&#8208;AMS) on gold electrodes yields thin films which are converted into stable polymer network structures by electrochemical crosslinking of the polymer chains via their pendant triphenylamine groups to yield N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tetraphenylbenzidine (TPB) crosslinking points. Finally, the resulting redox&#8208;active, TPB&#8208;crosslinked films are functionalized with ethynylferrocene (EFc) as a representative redox probe using a click reaction. Main experimental tools are polarization modulation infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy and scan rate dependent cyclic voltammetry. Especially the latter proves the successful conversion and the immobilization of redox probes in the polymer matrix. The results are compared with the reference system of azide&#8208;terminated self&#8208;assembled monolayers on gold substrates, allowing to distinguish between free and immobilized EFc species.

         <title>Understanding the Preparation and Reactivity of Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 Methane Dehydroaromatization Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methane dehydroaromatization is a promising reaction for the direct conversion of methane to liquid hydrocarbons. The active sites and the mechanism of this reaction remain controversial. This work is focused on the operando X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy analysis of conventional Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 catalyst during its whole lifetime. Complemented by other characterization techniques, we derived spectroscopic descriptors of molybdenum precursor decomposition and its exchange with zeolite Br&#248;nsted acid sites. We found that the reduction of Mo&#8208;species proceeds in two steps and the active sites are of siminar nature, regardless of the Mo content. Furthermore, the ZSM&#8208;5 unit cell contracts at the beginning of the reaction, which coincided with benzene formation and it is likely related to the formation of hydrocarbon pool intermediates. Finally, although reductive regeneration of used catalysts via methanation is less effective as compared to combustion of coke, it does not affect the structure of the catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysts for the Hydrofluorination of Alkynes Using Hydrofluoric Acid: Reaction Scope, Mechanistic Studies and the Tracking of Elusive Intermediates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unconventional fluorination: The development of the chemoselective gold&#8208;catalysed hydrofluorination of terminal alkynes using aqueous HF and an easily accessible N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;gold pre&#8208;catalyst is reported. Following the observation and isolation of unprecedented organometallic intermediates and computational studies, a catalytic cycle is proposed, featuring an in&#8197;situ generation of the chemoselective catalyst.







Abstract
An efficient and chemoselective methodology deploying gold&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes as catalysts in the hydrofluorination of terminal alkynes using aqueous HF has been developed. Mechanistic studies shed light on an in&#8197;situ generated catalyst, formed by the reaction of Br&#248;nsted basic gold pre&#8208;catalysts with HF in water, which exhibits the highest reactivity and chemoselectivity. The catalytic system has a wide alkyl substituted&#8208;substrate scope, and stoichiometric as well as catalytic reactions with tailor&#8208;designed gold pre&#8208;catalysts enable the identification of various gold species involved along the catalytic cycle. Computational studies aid in understanding the chemoselectivity observed through examination of key mechanistic steps for phosphine&#8208; and NHC&#8208;coordinated gold species bearing the triflate counterion and the elusive key complex bearing a bifluoride counterion.

New DB24C8&#8208;based [2]rotaxane molecular shuttles that contain ammonium, amine, Weinreb amide and/or ketone stations have been synthesized and characterized. Their shuttling behavior, which is linked to the ability of the considered moieties to act as efficient secondary molecular stations of more or less high affinity for the macrocycle, depended on the combination of stations and steric restrictions.







Abstract
This paper reports the synthesis and study of new pH&#8208;sensitive DB24C8&#8208;based [2]rotaxane molecular shuttles that contain within their axle four potential sites of interaction for the DB24C8: ammonium, amine, Weinreb amide, and ketone. In the protonated state, the DB24C8 lay around the best ammonium site. After either deprotonation or deprotonation&#8208;then&#8208;carbamoylation of the ammonium, different localizations of the DB24C8 were seen, depending on both the number and nature of the secondary stations and steric restriction. Unexpectedly, the results indicated that the Weinreb amide was not a proper secondary molecular station for the DB24C8. Nevertheless, through its methoxy side chain, it slowed down the shuttling of the macrocycle along the threaded axle, thereby partitioning the [2]rotaxane into two translational isomers on the NMR timescale. The ketone was successfully used as a secondary molecular station, and its weak affinity for the DB24C8 was similar to that of a secondary amine.

         <title>A Phosphorus&#8208;Based Pacman Dication Generated by Cooperative Self&#8208;Activation of a Pacman Phosphane</title>

You can play Pac Man with Phosphorus! The first non&#8208;metal Pacman compound, a calix[4]pyrrole schiff base ligand coordinating two highly dynamic P(III)Cl moieties is presented. Chloride abstraction with AgOTf leads to a macrocyclic dication with two embedded phosphorus monocations, both of which undergo a cooperative internal activation reaction.







Abstract
Formal coordination of phosphorus(III) by a calix[4]pyrrole Schiff base ligand was achieved through the reaction of this ligand with PCl3 under basic conditions. The reaction product adopts a Pacman conformation with two P&#8722;Cl moieties, one in exo and one in endo position. It represents the first non&#8208;metal compound of calix[4]pyrrole Schiff base ligands and of Pacman ligands in general. The spatial neighborhood of the two phosphorus atoms enables cooperative reactions. As a first example, the chloride abstraction with AgOTf is presented, yielding a macrocyclic dication with two embedded phosphorus(III) monocations, which both undergo a cooperative, internal activation reaction with an adjacent C=N double bond. This intramolecular redox process affords two pentacoordinated phosphorus(V) centers within the Pacman dication. All reaction products were fully characterized and all results are supported by computations.

The reaction product adopts a Pacman conformation with two P&#8722;Cl moieties, one in &lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt; and one in &lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt; position. It represents the first non-metal compound of calix[4]pyrrole Schiff base ligands and of Pacman ligands in general. The spatial neighborhood of the two phosphorus atoms enables cooperative reactions. As a first example, the chloride abstraction with AgOTf is presented, yielding a macrocyclic dication with two embedded phosphorus(III) monocations, which both undergo a cooperative, internal activation reaction with an adjacent C=N double bond. This intramolecular redox process affords two pentacoordinated phosphorus(V) centers within the Pacman dication. All reaction products were fully characterized and all results are supported by computations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Multi&#8208;Photon Tracking and Bioimaging of Glycosylated Theranostic Prodrugs upon Specific Enzyme Triggered Release</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycosylated theranostic prodrugs have been developed, whereby the therapeutic component undergoes triggered release upon enzyme activation of the glycosidic bond through action of the specific glycosidase enzymes, resulting in selective delivery of the therapeutic cargo, a process observed through real&#8208;time bioimaging.







Abstract
Real&#8208;time tracking of prodrug uptake, delivery and activation in&#8197;vivo represents a major challenge for prodrug development. Herein, we demonstrate the use of novel glycosylated theranostics of the cancer pharmacophore Amonafide in highly&#8208;selective, enzymatic triggered release. We show that the use of endogenous enzymes for activated release of the therapeutic component can be observed, in real time, and monitored using one and two&#8208;photon bioimaging, offering unique insight into the prodrug pharmacokinetic profile. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the potent cytotoxicity of Amonafide is preserved using this targeted approach.

         <title>Flexibility Control of Two&#8208;Dimensional Coordination Polymers by Crystal Morphology: Water Adsorption and Thermal Expansion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Preparing nanoplates of flexible two&#8208;dimensional coordination polymers provides significant structural changes involving the contraction of undulating layers. Such crystal morphology and size effects on layer structures modulate the dual functions of water adsorption and anisotropic thermal expansion.







Abstract
Layer flexibility in two&#8208;dimensional coordination polymers (2D&#8208;CPs) contributes to several functional materials as it results in anisotropic structural response to external stimuli. Chemical modification is a common technique for modifying layer structures. This study demonstrates that crystal morphology of a cyanide&#8208;bridged 2D&#8208;CP of type [Mn(salen)]2[ReN(CN)4] (1) consisting of flexible undulating layers significantly impacts the layer configuration and assembly. Nanoplates of 1 showed an in&#8208;plane contraction of layers with a longer interlayer distance compared to the micrometer&#8208;sized rod&#8208;type particles. These effects by crystal morphology on the structure of the 2D&#8208;CP impacted the structural flexibility, resulting in dual&#8208;functional changes: the enhancement of the sensitivity of structural transformation to water adsorption and modification of anisotropic thermal expansion of 1. Moreover, the nanoplates incorporated new adsorption sites within the layers, resulting in the uptake of an additional water molecule compared to the micrometer&#8208;sized rods.

         <title>Chemistry on the Complex: Derivatization of TiO4N2&#8208;Based Complexes and Application to Multi&#8208;Step Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemistry performed on TiO4N2&#8211;complexes enables the derivatization of 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline ligands via metal catalyzed reactions, click chemistry or imine condensation. These complexes are purified by chromatography and their structures are determined. The free substituted 1,10&#8208; phenanthroline compounds are easily obtained through the decoordination from the titanium center. The application of this chemistry on the complex permits to generate an original bis&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline compound.







Abstract
The chemistry on octahedral TiO4N2&#8208;complexes is described. The Ti(IV)&#8208;based precursors are composed of two 3,3&#8217;&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;biphenolato ligands (1) and one substituted 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline ligand (2&#8208;5). The application of imine condensation, palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C bond formation or copper&#8208;catalysed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition allowed the grafting of various new groups onto these species. In particular Sonogashira reactions permitted to observe an excellent conversion of the starting complexes. This systematic study enabled to compile the factors required to preserve the framework of the complexes in the course of a chemical transformation. Thanks to this chemistry realized on the complex, the Ti(1)2 fragment was used as a protecting group to develop a multi&#8208;step synthesis of a bis&#8208;phenanthroline compound (12), for which the synthesis without this protection failed. Thus, a dinuclear complex [Ti2(1)4(12)] was first prepared starting from complex precursor bearing an acetylenic function via a Hay coupling reaction. This was followed by a deprotection step affording 12. Overall, this work illustrates how the Ti(1)2 fragment could be an useful tool for the preparation of unprecedented diimine compounds.

         <title>Screening of Minimalist Noncanonical Sites in Duplex DNA and RNA Reveals Context and Motif&#8208;Selective Binding by Fluorogenic Base Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semi&#8208;rational approach to detect low affinity binding to noncanonical pair (NCP) sites in duplex DNA and RNA has been developed. A set of fluorogenic thiazole orange probes bearing abiotic (triazines, pyrimidines) and native RNA bases was screened against dsDNAs and dsRNAs with single abasic, single NCP and tandem NCP sites. Fluorogenic probe engagement revealed novel and selective base interactions with NCPs, setting the stage for a new strategy of targeting noncanonical motifs in RNA.







Abstract
We hypothesize that programmable hybridization to noncanonical nucleic acid motifs may be achieved by macromolecular display of binders to individual noncanonical pairs (NCPs). As each recognition element may individually have weak binding to an NCP, we developed a semi&#8208;rational approach to detect low affinity interactions between selected nitrogenous bases and noncanonical sites in duplex DNA and RNA. A set of fluorogenic probes was synthesized by coupling abiotic (triazines, pyrimidines) and native RNA bases to thiazole orange (TO) dye. This probe library was screened against duplex nucleic acid substrates bearing single abasic, single NCP, and tandem NCP sites. Probe engagement with NCP sites was reported by 100&#8211;1000&#215; fluorescence enhancement over background. Binding is strongly context&#8208;dependent, reflective of both molecular recognition and stability: less stable motifs are more likely to bind a synthetic probe. Further, DNA and RNA substrates exhibit entirely different abasic and single NCP binding profiles. While probe binding in the abasic and single NCP screens was monotonous, much richer binding profiles were observed with the screen of tandem NCP sites in RNA, in part due to increased steric accessibility. In addition to known binding interactions between the triazine melamine (M) and T/U sites, the NCP screens identified new targeting elements for pyrimidine&#8208;rich motifs in single NCPs and 2&#215;2 internal bulges. We anticipate that semi&#8208;rational approaches of this type will lead to programmable noncanonical hybridization strategies at the macromolecular level.

         <title>On the Supra&#8208;LUMO Interaction: Case Study of a Sudden Change of Electronic Structure as a Functional Emergence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon sudden change of electronic structure (SCES), the doubly&#8208;electrophoric trans conformer of this redox&#8208;active assembly switches into a singly&#8208;superelectrophoric cis conformer on account of the synergistic interplay of electrophilic centers pertaining to the two pyridinium moieties.

The synergistic functioning of redox&#8208;active components that emerges from prototypical 2,2&#8242;&#8208;di(N&#8208;methylpyrid&#8208;4&#8208;ylium)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl is described. Interestingly, even if a trans conformation of the native assembly is expected, due to electrostatic repulsion between cationic pyridinium units, we demonstrate that cis conformation is equally energy&#8208;stabilized on account of a peculiar LUMO (SupLUMO) that develops through space, encompassing the two pyridiniums in a single, made&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8208;piece, electronic entity (superelectrophoric behavior). This SupLUMO emergence, with the cis species as superelectrophore embodiment, originates in a sudden change of electronic structure. This finding is substantiated by insights from solid state (single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction) and solution (NOE NMR and UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR spectroelectrochemistry) studies, combined with electronic structure computations. Electrochemistry shows that electron transfers are so strongly correlated that two&#8208;electron reduction manifests itself as a single&#8208;step process with a large potential inversion consistent with inner creation of a carbon&#8208;carbon bond (digital simulation). Besides, absence of reductive formation of dimers is a further indication of a preferential intramolecular reactivity determined by the SupLUMO interaction (cis isomer pre&#8208;organization). The redox&#8208;gated covalent bond, serving as electron reservoir, was studied via atropisomerism of the reduction product (VT&#8197;NMR study). The overall picture derived from this in&#8208;depth study of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;di(N&#8208;methylpyrid&#8208;4&#8208;ylium)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl proves that trans and cis species are worth considered as intrinsically sharply different, that is, as doubly&#8208;electrophoric and singly&#8208;superelectrophoric switchable assemblies, beyond conformational isomerism. Most importantly, the through&#8208;space&#8208;mediated SupLUMO may come in complement of other weak interactions encountered in Supramolecular Chemistry as a tool for the design of electroactive architectures.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upon sudden change&lt;/b&gt; of electronic structure (SCES), the doubly-electrophoric &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; conformer of this redox-active assembly switches into a singly-superelectrophoric &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; conformer on account of the synergistic interplay of electrophilic centers pertaining to the two pyridinium moieties. An extended LUMO (coined as supLUMO) indeed develops through space, which also plays the role of electron reservoir.

         <title>Rational Design of Self&#8208;Assembled Mitochondria&#8208;Targeting Lytic Peptide Conjugates with Enhanced Tumor Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To improve the tumor selectivity of membrane lytic peptides, a self&#8208;assembly strategy based on rational design of peptide conjugates has been developed. A hydrophobic triphenylphosphonium (TPP) group for mitochondria targeting and a hydrophilic arginine&#8208;glycine&#8208;aspartic acid (RGD) sequence targeting the integrin receptor have been incorporated to pH&#8208;responsive lytic peptides. The self&#8208;assembled nanoparticles are endocytosed selectively into the cancer cells, followed by the disruption of lysosomal and mitochondrial membranes, and lead to apoptotic cell death in the micromolar range.







Abstract
Membrane lytic peptides (MLP) are widely explored as cellular delivery vehicles or antitumor/antibacterial agents. However, the poor selectivity between cancer and normal cells slims their prospects as potential anti&#8208;tumor drugs. Herein, we have developed a rationally designed self&#8208;assembly strategy to enhance tumor selectivity of MLP&#8208;based conjugates, incorporating a hydrophobic triphenylphosphonium (TPP) group for mitochondria targeting, and a hydrophilic arginine&#8208;glycine&#8208;aspartic acid (RGD) sequence targeting integrins. The self&#8208;assembly nanoparticles can enhance the stability of the peptides in&#8197;vitro plasma and be endocytosed selectively into the cancer cells. The histidine&#8208;rich lytic peptide component assists the disruption of endosomal/lysosomal membranes and subsequent the mitochondria membrane, which leads to apoptosis. This rational design of MLP&#8208;based conjugates provides a practical strategy to increase the application prospects of lytic peptides in cancer treatment.

         <title>19F MRI Probes for Multimodal Imaging**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic resonance is one of the most effective imaging instruments available today, capable of showing superior soft tissue contrast. Multimodal 19F MRI probes have the potential to enhance detection sensitivity and accuracy, which is crucial in disease diagnosis. This review discusses research in the integration of 19F MRI probes with other modalities, with an emphasis on the structure, physicochemical properties, biocompatibility, and image quality.







Abstract
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most powerful imaging tools today, capable of displaying superior soft&#8208;tissue contrast. This review discusses developments in the field of 19F MRI multimodal probes in combination with optical fluorescence imaging (OFI), 1H MRI, chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI, ultrasonography (USG), X&#8208;ray computed tomography (CT), single photon emission tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET), and photoacoustic imaging (PAI). In each case, multimodal 19F MRI probes compensate for the deficiency of individual techniques and offer improved sensitivity or accuracy of detection over unimodal counterparts. Strategies for designing 19F MRI multimodal probes are described with respect to their structure, physicochemical properties, biocompatibility, and the quality of images.

         <title>Coupling of photoactive transition metal complexes to a functional polymer matrix**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration of molecular light&#8208;driven catalyst into a polymer matrix allows to tailor photochemical devices as the embedding can give control over charge transfer processes, photochemical reactivity and degradation resistance. Combining periodic and local quantum chemical approaches, we elucidate the electronic coupling between a polymer and a photosensitive complex, which is a prerequisite for a rational tailoring of such systems. Thus, we identify possible routes towards photoinduced excitations that could trigger catalytic reactions at metal centers attached to the photosensitizer.







Abstract
Conductive polymers represent a promising alternative to semiconducting oxide electrodes typically used in dye&#8208;sensitized cathodes as they more easily allow a tuning of the physicochemical properties. This can then also be very beneficial for using them in light&#8208;driven catalysis. In this computational study, we address the coupling of Ru&#8208;based photosensitizers to a polymer matrix by combining two different first&#8208;principles electronic structure approaches. We use a periodic density functional theory code to properly account for the delocalized nature of the electronic states in the polymer. These ground state investigations are complemented by time&#8208;dependent density functional theory simulations to assess the Franck&#8208;Condon photophysics of the present photoactive hybrid material based on a molecular model system. Our results are consistent with recent experimental observations and allow to elucidate the light&#8208;driven redox chemical processes &#8211; eventually leading to charge separation &#8211; in the present functional hybrid systems with potential application as photocathode materials.

         <title>An NHC&#8208;Stabilized H2GeBH2 Precursor for the Preparation of Cationic Group 13/14/15 Hydride Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The NHC&#8208;stabilized compound IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2OTf was synthesized. Reactivity studies on this novel building block with different phosphines and AsPh3 showed its potential to serve as an ideal precursor for unprecedented cationic group 13/14/15 chain compounds. In addition, a reaction with PH3 leads to the formation of the parent hydrides [IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2PH3][OTf] and [IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH3][OTf].







Abstract
The synthesis, characterization and reactivity studies of the NHC&#8208;stabilized complex IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2OTf (1) (IDipp=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) are reported. Nucleophilic substitution of the triflate (OTf) group in 1 by phosphine or arsine donors provides access to the cationic group 13/14/15 chains [IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2ERR1R2]+ (2 E=P; R, R1=H; R2=tBu; 3 E=P; R=H; R1, R2=Ph; 4&#8201;a E=P; R, R1, R2=Ph; 4&#8201;b E=As; R, R1, R2=Ph). These novel cationic chains were characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Moreover, the formation of the parent complexes [IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2PH3][OTf] (5) and [IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH3][OTf] (6) were achieved by reaction of 1 with PH3. Accompanying DFT computations give insight into the stability of the formed chains with respect to their decomposition.

In addition, a reaction with PH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; leads to the formation of the parent hydrides [IDipp&#8201;&lt;b&gt;&#8901;&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;GeH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;][OTf] and [IDipp&#8201;&lt;b&gt;&#8901;&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;GeH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;][OTf].
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis, characterization and reactivity studies of the NHC-stabilized complex IDipp&#8201;&lt;b&gt;&#8901;&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;GeH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OTf (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) (IDipp=1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin-2-ylidene) are reported. Nucleophilic substitution of the triflate (OTf) group in &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; by phosphine or arsine donors provides access to the cationic group 13/14/15 chains [IDipp&#8201;&lt;b&gt;&#8901;&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;GeH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ERR&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; E=P; R, R&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;=H; R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;Bu; &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; E=P; R=H; R&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=Ph; &lt;b&gt;4&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; E=P; R, R&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=Ph; &lt;b&gt;4&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt; E=As; R, R&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=Ph). These novel cationic chains were characterized by X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Moreover, the formation of the parent complexes [IDipp&#8201;&lt;b&gt;&#8901;&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;GeH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;][OTf] (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;) and [IDipp&#8201;&lt;b&gt;&#8901;&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;GeH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;][OTf] (&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;) were achieved by reaction of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; with PH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Accompanying DFT computations give insight into the stability of the formed chains with respect to their decomposition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Direct Oxidation of Primary Amines to Carboxylic Acids through Tandem ortho&#8208;Naphthoquinone&#8208;Catalyzed and TBHP&#8208;Promoted Oxidation Sequence</title>

         <dc:description>
A tandem oxidation sequence of amines to carboxylic acids is developed through the o&#8208;NQ&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidation of amines to imines followed by the radical&#8208;initiated TBHP&#8208;promoted oxidation of imine intermediates. Mechanistically, the selective imine formation by o&#8208;NQ catalyst system is facilitated by the assistance of TBAI, also critical in the following TBHP&#8208;promoted oxidation of imine derivatives to break down the imines to aldehydes and amines. In turn, the released amines re&#8208;enter into the o&#8208;NQ catalytic cycle to produce the imine intermediates.







Abstract
Biomimetic oxidation of primary amines to carboxylic acids has been developed where the copper&#8208;containing amine oxidase (CuAO)&#8208;like o&#8208;NQ&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidation was combined with the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)&#8208;like TBHP&#8208;mediated imine oxidation protocol. Notably, the current tandem oxidation strategy provides a new mechanistic insight into the imine intermediate and the seemingly simple TBHP&#8208;mediated oxidation pathways of imines. The developed metal&#8208;free amine oxidation protocol allows the use of molecular oxygen and TBHP, safe forms of oxidant that may appeal to the industrial application.

Ribbon&#8208;like and block&#8208;like crystals of (E)&#8208;3&#8208;(3,5&#8208;dichlorophenyl)&#8208;1&#8208;(p&#8208;tolyl)prop&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;one (2ClChMe&#8208;4) exhibit curling/flipping and expansion, respectively, upon heating on account of single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformations in polymorphs. Besides, 2ClChMe&#8208;4 can undergo a solid&#8208;state [2+2] cycloaddition reaction, which becomes the driving force for the photo&#8208;induced bending of the ribbon&#8208;like crystal, so that the molecular&#8208;crystal&#8208;based photoactuator could perform mechanical work for carrying small object. Herein, a multi&#8208;stimuli responsive actuator showing reversible bending&#8208;unbending behavior triggered by light and heat successively has been fabricated.







Abstract
The polymorphs of 2ClChMe&#8208;4 in Form I (ribbon&#8208;like crystal) and Form II (block&#8208;like crystal) were prepared, and they exhibited curling/flipping and expansion upon heating on account of single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformations. The irreversible phase transformations occurred separately at 53.2&#8201;&#176;C and 57.8&#8201;&#176;C for the crystals in Form I and Form II, during which the molecular conformation of 2ClChMe&#8208;4 changed and the molecules slipped along the (100) plane. Movement at the molecular level resulted in changes of cell parameters, which in turn led to macroscopic motions of the crystals upon heating. Additionally, the ribbon&#8208;like crystals of 2ClChMe&#8208;4 showed photo&#8208;induced bending driven by [2+2] cycloaddition. Accordingly, an actuator showing reversible bending behavior was fabricated triggered by light and heat successively. Like biomimetic self&#8208;actuators, such multi&#8208;stimuli mechanical responsive molecular crystals might have potential applications in soft robots, artificial muscles and microfluidic systems.

Beer taste of your favorite is blendable! Comprehensive identification of derivatives from trans&#8208;iso&#8208;&#945;&#8208;acid, derived from one of the most abundant secondary metabolites in hops, was achieved by the HPLC&#8208;assisted crystalline sponge method. Thirteen components, including previously unknown eight, were fully characterized, promising the development of new, advanced brewing technology for controlling the bitter components of beer.







Abstract
Trans&#8208;iso&#8208;&#945;&#8208;acid is one of the main contributors to the bitter taste of fresh beer and is known to transform into various derivatives during beer aging. However, structural characterization of the derivatives has been a challenging task because of the formation of too many components. Herein, we report that most of the transformation products of trans&#8208;iso&#8208;&#945;&#8208;acid, isolated in this study in only small quantities by HPLC, can be structurally analyzed with the crystalline sponge method. Thirteen compounds, including eight that were previously unreported, have been successfully isolated and analyzed with complete assignment of their absolute configuration. This provides an improved understanding of the chemical transformations that occur during beer aging.

         <title>Comprehensive Mechanism of CO2 Electroreduction on Non&#8208;Noble Metal Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts of Mo2CS2&#8208;MXene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of non&#8208;noble metal single&#8208;atom catalyst of Mo2CS2&#8208;MXene for CO2 reduction were systematically investigated (see figure). The Cr&#8208;, Fe&#8208;, Co&#8208; and Ni&#8208;Mo2CS2 have excellent CO2RR catalytic activity, and their limiting potentials are in the range of 0.245&#8211;0.304&#8197;V. Fe&#8208;Mo2CS2 with a nitrogenase&#8208;like structure has the lowest limiting potential and the highest electrocatalytic activity.







Abstract
In this work, a series of non&#8208;noble metal single&#8208;atom catalysts of Mo2CS2&#8208;MXene for CO2 reduction were systematically investigated by well&#8208;defined density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory (DFT) calculations. It is found that nine types of transitional metal (TM) supported Mo2CS2 (TM&#8208;Mo2CS2) are very stable, while eight can effectively inhibit the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). After comprehensively comparing the changes of free energy for each pathway in CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), it is found that the products of TM&#8208;Mo2CS2 are not completely CH4. Furthermore, Cr&#8208;, Fe&#8208;, Co&#8208; and Ni&#8208;Mo2CS2 are found to render excellent CO2RR catalytic activity, and their limiting potentials are in the range of 0.245&#8211;0.304&#8197;V. In particular, Fe&#8208;Mo2CS2 with a nitrogenase&#8208;like structure has the lowest limiting potential and the highest electrocatalytic activity. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations have also proven that these kinds of single&#8208;atom catalysts with robust performance could exist stably at room temperature. Therefore, these single TM atoms anchored on the surface of MXenes can be profiled as a promising catalyst for the electrochemical reduction of CO2.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, a series of non-noble metal single-atom catalysts of Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-MXene for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction were systematically investigated by well-defined density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations. It is found that nine types of transitional metal (TM) supported Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (TM-Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are very stable, while eight can effectively inhibit the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). After comprehensively comparing the changes of free energy for each pathway in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR), it is found that the products of TM-Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are not completely CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Furthermore, Cr-, Fe-, Co- and Ni-Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are found to render excellent CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR catalytic activity, and their limiting potentials are in the range of 0.245&#8211;0.304&#8197;V. In particular, Fe-Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with a nitrogenase-like structure has the lowest limiting potential and the highest electrocatalytic activity. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations have also proven that these kinds of single-atom catalysts with robust performance could exist stably at room temperature. Therefore, these single TM atoms anchored on the surface of MXenes can be profiled as a promising catalyst for the electrochemical reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pivotal Role of Holes in Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction on TiO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bare TiO2 cannot conduct a photocatalytic oxidation reaction and photocatalytic CO2 reduction simultaneously, as demonstrated by Moustakas et&#8197;al. This points to a key role of holes in the CO2 reduction mechanism towards the final product CH4.







Abstract
Evidence is provided that in a gas&#8208;solid photocatalytic reaction the removal of photogenerated holes from a titania (TiO2) photocatalyst is always detrimental for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The coupling of the reaction to a sacrificial oxidation reaction hinders or entirely prohibits the formation of CH4 as a reduction product. This agrees with earlier work in which the detrimental effect of oxygen&#8208;evolving cocatalysts was demonstrated. Photocatalytic alcohol oxidation or even overall water splitting proceeds in these reaction systems, but carbon&#8208;containing products from CO2 reduction are no longer observed. H2 addition is also detrimental, either because it scavenges holes or because it is not an efficient proton donor on TiO2. The results are discussed in light of previously suggested reaction mechanisms for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The formation of CH4 from CO2 is likely not a linear sequence of reduction steps but includes oxidative elementary steps. Furthermore, new hypotheses on the origin of the required protons are suggested.

         <title>Partial Hydrolysis of Cyanide Coordination Polymers Induced by a Pillar Ligand with Optimized Electrochemical Kinetics for Rechargeable Alkaline Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Delaying the inevitable: Hydrolysis of MOF and coordination polymer electrode materials in alkaline electrolyte is inevitable. However, we have found that the hydrolysis of cyanide&#8208;bridged nickel&#8208;based coordination polymer electrode materials can be suppressed by the introduction of pillared pyrazine ligands; this optimizes the electrochemical performance. The possible mechanism of partial hydrolysis of electrode materials was proposed, and the hypothesis was justified by ex situ electrochemical and structural characterization.







Abstract
Coordination polymers are promising cathode materials for rechargeable alkaline batteries. Therefore, the precise modulation of these cathodes by chemical structure and in&#8208;depth structure transform study is necessary. Here, two model coordination polymer battery cathodes were designed to demonstrate the dynamic structure&#8211;performance relationship. We studied the electrochemical performance of two kinds of nickel&#8208;based coordination polymer, comprising a planar 2D cyanide&#8208;bridged network and a 3D cyanide&#8208;bridged network pillared by pyrazine molecules. The 2D coordination polymer showed serious voltage degradation with poor rate capability, whereas the 3D coordination polymer exhibited stable voltage output coupled with high rate at various current densities. The investigation revealed the underlining relationship of plateau voltage degradation and hydrolysis process of electrodes. It was revealed that the pyrazine pillar molecules in the 3D coordination polymer could suppress the hydrolysis and lead to the in&#8197;situ formation of partially hydrolyzed structure with excellent electrochemical kinetics; this exhibited obvious smaller peak separation (27&#8197;mV compared with 149&#8197;mV) and hence an almost twofold increase in capacity retention (31.9 to 50.0&#8201;%) and energy density retention (18.2 to 35.9&#8201;%) at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>PEGylated Poly&#8208;HDACi: a Designer Polyprodrug from Optimized Drug Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We designed, synthesized, and characterized a tri&#8208;block copolymer. Its hydrophobic part, a chain of histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) prodrug, was symmetrically flanked by two identical PEG blocks, whereas the built&#8208;in HDACi was a linear molecule, terminated with a thiol at one end, and a hydroxyl group at the other. Such a feature facilitated end to end linkage of prodrugs through alternatively aligned disulfides and carbonates. The disulfides served dual roles: redox sensors of smart nanomedicine, and warheads of masked HDACi drugs. This approach carefully designed to benefit both control&#8208;release and efficacy, is conceptually novel for optimizing drug units in nanomedicine. Micelles from this designer polyprodrug released only PEG, CO 2 and HDACi, and synergized with DOX against HCT116 cells, demonstrating its widespread potential in combination therapy. Our work for the first time highlighted the unique advantage of thiol&#8208;based drug molecules in nanomedicine design.</dc:description>

         <title>An ESIPT&#8208;dependent AIE fluorophore based on HBT derivative: substituent positional impact on aggregated luminescence and its application for hydrogen peroxide detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aiming to develop the facile organic fluorophore possessing excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), we designed and synthesized two isomers with different linkage site between hydroxyl of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl) benzothiazole (HBT) and a benzothiazole substituent (para position refers to  p&#8208;  BHBT  and ortho position refers to  o&#8208;  BHBT  ). Fluorescence emission properties of  p&#8208;  BHBT  and  o&#8208;  BHBT  in THF/water mixtures with different water volume fractions indicated an opposite luminescence in aggregates, in which  p&#8208;  BHBT  showed an ESIPT&#8208;dependent AIE properties while  o&#8208;  BHBT  displayed ESIPT effect and aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) qualities.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aiming to develop the facile organic fluorophore possessing excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) and aggregation-induced emission (AIE), we designed and synthesized two isomers with different linkage site between hydroxyl of 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl) benzothiazole (HBT) and a benzothiazole substituent (para position refers to  p-  BHBT  and ortho position refers to  o-  BHBT  ). Fluorescence emission properties of  p-  BHBT  and  o-  BHBT  in THF/water mixtures with different water volume fractions indicated an opposite luminescence in aggregates, in which  p-  BHBT  showed an ESIPT-dependent AIE properties while  o-  BHBT  displayed ESIPT effect and aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) qualities. A possible mechanism for molecular actions to illustrate the aggregating luminescence alteration of these two isomers had been proposed and verified by theoretical and experimental studies. More importantly,  Probe-1  , generated from dual ESIPT-AIE fluorophore  p-  BHBT  , was successfully used as a ratiometric fluorescent chemosensor for highly selective (above 15-fold over other ROS) and sensitive (69-fold fluorescence enhancement with 0.22 &#956;M of detection limit) detection of hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solution and living cells, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic reduction of oximes to hydroxylamines: current methods, challenges and opportunities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic reduction of oximes represents a direct efficient approach to synthesize valuable hydroxylamine derivatives. However this transformation presents significant challenges: oximes are hard to reduce and, if reactive, reductive cleavage of the weak N&#8210;O bond often leads to primary amine side products. The first suitable systems involved the use of platinum&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts with hydrogen as reductant and stoichiometric amounts of a strong Br&#248;nsted acid. More recently metal&#8208;free and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based homogeneous catalysts have been developed, which display the highest turnovers (up to 4000). In the asymmetric variants, the  E/Z  &#8208;geometry of the oxime double bond affects significantly the stereoselectivity, sometimes requiring extra synthetic efforts in substrate preparation. This minireview provides an overview of the advances and limitations in catalytic oxime to hydroxylamine reduction. Emphasis is put on highlighting and comparing the practical aspects of the existing methods, such as their reaction conditions and substrate scope. Additionally, future directions for improving this young research area are suggested.</dc:description>

         <title>Accessing Cationic &#945;&#8208;Silylated and &#945;&#8208;Germylated Phosphorus Ylides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and full characterization of &#945;&#8208;silylated (&#945;&#8208;SiCPs, 1&#8208;7) and &#945;&#8208;germylated (&#945;&#8208;GeCPs) (11&#8208;13) phosphorus ylides bearing one chloride substituent R3PC(R1)E(Cl)R22 (R = Ph; R1 = Me, Et, Ph; R2 = Me, Et, iPr, Mes; E = Si, Ge) is presented. The molecular structures were determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. The title compounds were applied in halide abstraction studies in order to access cationic species. The reaction of Ph3PC(Me)Si(Cl)Me2 (1) with Na[B(C6F5)4] furnished the dimeric phosphonium&#8208;like dication [Ph3PC(Me)SiMe2]2[B(C6F5)4]2 (8). The highly reactive, mesityl&#8208; or iPr&#8208;substituted cationic species [Ph3PC(Me)SiMes2][B(C6F5)4] (9) and [Ph3PC(Et)SiiPr2][B(C6F5)4] (10) could be characterized by NMR spectroscopy. Carrying out the halide abstraction reaction in the sterically demanding ether iPr2O afforded the protonated &#945;&#8208;SiCP [Ph3PCH(Et)Si(Cl)iPr2][B(C6F5)4] (6dec) by sodium mediated basic ether decomposition, whereas successfully synthesized [Ph3PC(Et)SiiPr2][B(C6F5)4] (10) readily cleaves the F&#8211;C bond in fluorobenzene. Thus, the ambiphilic character of &#945;&#8208;SiCPs is clearly demonstrated. The less reactive germanium analogue [Ph3PC(Me)GeMes2][B(3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3)4] (14) was obtained by reacting 11 with Na[B(3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3)4] and fully characterized including X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Structural parameters indicate a strong CYlide&#8211;Ge interaction with high double bond character, and consequently the C&#8211;E (E = Si, Ge) bonds in 9, 10 and 14 were analyzed with NBO and AIM methods.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Bis&#8208;arene sandwich complexes are generally prepared by the Fischer&#8208;Hafner reaction, which conditions are incompatible with most O&#8208; and N&#8208; functional groups.

N&#8208;methylpyrrolidine (NMP) facilitates the substitution of naphthalene with the incoming arene. A series of fully characterized rhenium sandwich complexes with simple arenes, such as aniline, as well as with active compounds like lidocaine and melatonin are presented. With these rhenium compounds in hand, the radioactive sandwich complexes [  99m  Tc(&#951;  6  &#8208;pharm)  2  ]  +  (pharm = pharmaceutical) can be unambiguously confirmed. The direct labelling of pharmaceuticals with  99m  Tc through &#951;  6  &#8208;coordination to phenyl rings and the confirmation of the structures with the rhenium homologues opens a path into molecular theranostics.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding the Effects of Binders in Gas Sorption and Acidity of Aluminum Fumarate Extrudates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the impact of shaping processes on solid adsorbents is critical for the implementation of MOFs in industrial separation processes or as catalytic materials. Production of MOF&#8208;containing shaped particles is typically associated with loss of porosity and modification of acid sites, two phenomena that affect their performance. Herein, we report a detailed study on how extrusion affects the crystallinity, porosity, and acidity of the aluminum fumarate MOF with clays or SiO  2  gel binders. Thorough characterization showed that the clay binders confer the extrudates a good mechanical robustness at the expense of porosity, while silica gel shows an opposite trend. The CO  2  selectivity towards CH  4,  of interest for natural gas separation processes, is maintained upon the extrusion process Moreover, probe FT&#8208;IR spectroscopy revealed no major changes in the types of acid sites. This study highlights that these abundant and inexpensive clay materials may be used for scaling MOFs as active adsorbents.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Two new sodium aluminum borates, Na  3  AlB  8  O  15  and Na  3  Al  2  B  7  O  15  , have been successfully synthesized by the high&#8208;temperature solution method. They crystallize in the different space groups,  P  2  1  /  c  and  P  2/  c  , respectively. The B&#8208;O configurations of &#946;&#8208;Na  2  B  6  O  10  , Na  3  AlB  8  O  15  and Na  3  Al  2  B  7  O  15  are compared to feature complicated different dimensional open&#8208;framework structures caused by the substitution of [BO  4  ] by [AlO  4  ] covalent tetrahedra. Moreover, the experimental results indicate that Na  3  AlB  8  O  15  and Na  3  Al  2  B  7  O  15  have short ultraviolet (UV) cutoff edges (&lt;187 nm). The first&#8208;principles calculations show that Na  3  AlB  8  O  15  and Na  3  Al  2  B  7  O  15  have moderate birefringence (0.075 and 0.041 @1064 nm, respectively).</dc:description>

         <title>An isolable gallium&#8208;substituted nitrilimine and its reactivity with B&#8208;H, Si&#8208;H and B&#8208;B bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reaction of the Ga(I) compound NacNacGa (  9  ) with the diazo compound N  2  CHSiMe  3  affords the nitrilimine compound NacNacGa(N&#8208;NCSiMe  3  )(CH  2  SiMe  3  ) (  10  ). Carrying out this reaction in the presence of pyridine does not lead to C&#8208;H activation on the transient alkylidene NacNacGa=CHSiMe  3  , but generates a metallated diazo species NacNacGa(NHN=CHSiMe  3  )(CN  2  SiMe  3  ) (  13  ) that further rearranges into the isonitrile compound NacNac&#8208; Ga(NHN=CHSiMe  3  )(N(NC)SiMe  3  ) (  15  ). Reactions of  10  with the silane H  3  SiPh and the borane HBcat furnished products of 1,3 addition to the nitrilimine moiety NacNacGa{N(ER  n  )NCSiMe  3  }(CH  2  SiMe  3  ), whereas reaction with the diborane B  2  cat  2  gave the product of formal nitrene insertion into the B&#8208;B bond. DFT calculations suggest that the interaction of  9  with N  2  CHSiMe  3  proceeds via intermediate formation of an alkylidene compound that undergoes CH activation with a second molecule of N  2  CHSiMe  3  . Insertion into the B&#8208;B bond likely proceeds via an initial 1,3&#8208;addition of the diborane, followed by boryl migration to the former nitrene center.</dc:description>

         <title>Orthogonal Catalysis for an Enantioselective Domino Inverse&#8208;Electron Demand Diels&#8208;Alder / Substitution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An enantioselective domino process for the synthesis of substituted 1,2&#8208;dihydronaphthalenes has been developed, by the combination of chiral amines and a bidentate Lewis acid in an orthogonal catalysis. This new method is based on an inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder and a subsequent group exchange reaction. An enamine is generated in situ from an aldehyde and a chiral secondary amine catalyst which reacts with phthalazine, activated by the coordination to a bidentate Lewis acid catalyst. The absolute configuration of the product is controlled by chiral information provided by the amine. The formed  ortho  &#8208;quinodimethane intermediate is then transformed via a group exchange reaction with thiols. The new method shows a broad scope and tolerates a wide range of functional groups with enantiomeric ratios up to 91:9. All&#8208;in&#8208;all, this enantioselective synthesis tool provides an easy access to complex 1,2&#8208;dihydronaphthalenes starting from readily available phthalazine, aldehydes and thiols in a combinatorial way.</dc:description>

         <title>Interplay of Polarity and Confinement in Asymmetric Catalysis with Chiral Rh Diene Complexes in Microemulsions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doping the nanoscale confinement of microemulsions with cationic surfactants improves yield and chirality transfer in the Rh&#8208;catalyzed nucleophile additions.







Abstract
Microemulsions provide a unique opportunity to tailor the polarity and liquid confinement in asymmetric catalysis via nanoscale polar and nonpolar domains separated by a surfactant film. For chiral diene Rh complexes, the influence of counterion and surfactant film on the catalytic activity and enantioselectivity remained elusive. To explore this issue chiral norbornadiene Rh(X) complexes (X=OTf, OTs, OAc, PO2F2) were synthesized and characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography and theoretical calculations. These complexes were used in Rh&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;additions of phenylboroxine to N&#8208;tosylimine in microemulsions stabilized either exclusively by n&#8208;octyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;glucopyranoside (C8G1) or a C8G1&#8208;film doped with anionic or cationic surfactants (AOT, SDS and DTAB). The Rh(OAc) complex showed the largest dependence on the composition of the microemulsion, yielding up to 59&#8201;% (90&#8201;%ee) for the surfactant film doped with 5&#8197;wt% of AOT as compared to 52&#8201;% (58&#8201;%ee) for neat C8G1 at constant surfactant concentration. Larger domains, determined by SAXS analysis, enabled further increase in yield and selectivity while the reaction rate almost remained constant according to kinetic studies.

         <title>Metallodrug Profiling against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Target Proteins Identifies Highly Potent Inhibitors of the S/ACE2 interaction and the Papain&#8208;like Protease PLpro</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite their increasing relevance in medicinal chemistry, metal complexes are still underrepresented in compound screening libraries for drug discovery. In this work more than 100 metal complexes were evaluated as inhibitors of two targets in the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 life cycle, the interaction of the spike protein with the ACE2 receptor and the protease PLpro. The most active inhibitors were studied for antiviral effects in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infected cells and led to the discovery of active compounds that will provide starting points for future drug design.







Abstract
The global spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) has called for an urgent need for dedicated antiviral therapeutics. Metal complexes are commonly underrepresented in compound libraries that are used for screening in drug discovery campaigns, however, there is growing evidence for their role in medicinal chemistry. Based on previous results, we have selected more than 100&#8197;structurally diverse metal complexes for profiling as inhibitors of two relevant SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 replication mechanisms, namely the interaction of the spike (S) protein with the ACE2 receptor and the papain&#8208;like protease PLpro. In addition to many well&#8208;established types of mononuclear experimental metallodrugs, the pool of compounds tested was extended to approved metal&#8208;based therapeutics such as silver sulfadiazine and thiomersal, as well as polyoxometalates (POMs). Among the mononuclear metal complexes, only a small number of active inhibitors of the S/ACE2 interaction was identified, with titanocene dichloride as the only strong inhibitor. However, among the gold and silver containing complexes many turned out to be very potent inhibitors of PLpro activity. Highly promising activity against both targets was noted for many POMs. Selected complexes were evaluated in antiviral SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 assays confirming activity for gold complexes with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) or dithiocarbamato ligands, a silver NHC complex, titanocene dichloride as well as a POM compound. These studies might provide starting points for the design of metal&#8208;based SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 antiviral agents.

         <title>Relationship Between Molecular Structure, Single Crystal Packing and Self&#8208;Assembly Behavior: A Case Based on Pyrene Imide Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of new n&#8208;type one&#8208;dimensional (1D) self&#8208;assembly nanostructure and a clear understanding of the relationship between molecular structure and self&#8208;assembly behavior are important prerequisites for further designing and optimizing organic optoelectronic nanodevice. In this article, a series of n&#8208;type organic semiconductor materials based on pyrene imide were successfully synthesized through [4+2] cycloaddition reactions and their preliminary optical and electrochemical properties were studied. The simulated HOMO&#8208;LUMO bandgaps via DFT tallied with the experimental data well. The self&#8208;assembly of these materials showed needle or fiber&#8208;like morphologies, indicating that different conjugation degree or alkyl group had significant influence on their self&#8208;assembly behaviors. Furthermore, the single&#8208;crystal packing for these molecules were analyzed and it was found out that the changes of conjugated backbone and functional group would affect certain crystal lattice parameter significantly, such as the intermolecular packing distance and crystal size etc, which would further result in different self&#8208;assembly morphology.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Development of new n-type one-dimensional (1D) self-assembly nanostructure and a clear understanding of the relationship between molecular structure and self-assembly behavior are important prerequisites for further designing and optimizing organic optoelectronic nanodevice. In this article, a series of n-type organic semiconductor materials based on pyrene imide were successfully synthesized through [4+2] cycloaddition reactions and their preliminary optical and electrochemical properties were studied. The simulated HOMO-LUMO bandgaps via DFT tallied with the experimental data well. The self-assembly of these materials showed needle or fiber-like morphologies, indicating that different conjugation degree or alkyl group had significant influence on their self-assembly behaviors. Furthermore, the single-crystal packing for these molecules were analyzed and it was found out that the changes of conjugated backbone and functional group would affect certain crystal lattice parameter significantly, such as the intermolecular packing distance and crystal size etc, which would further result in different self-assembly morphology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Monitoring the thiol/thiophenol molecule&#8208;modulated plasmon&#8208;mediated silver oxidation with dark&#8208;field optical microscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface plasmon can trigger or accelerate many photochemical reactions, especially useful in energy and environmental industries. Recently, molecular adsorption has been proved effective in modulating the plasmon&#8208;mediated photochemistry, however the realized chemical reactions are limited and the mechanism behind is still unclear. Herein, by using  in situ  dark&#8208;field optical microscopy, the plasmon&#8208;mediated oxidative etching of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs), a typical hot&#8208;hole&#8208;driven reaction, is monitored continuously and quantitatively. The presence of thiol or thiophenol molecules is found essential in the silver oxidation. In addition, the rate of silver oxidation is modulated by the choice of different thiol or thiophenol molecules. Compared with the molecules having electron donating groups, the ones having electron accepting groups accelerate the silver oxidation dramatically. The thiol/thiophenol modulation is attributed to the modulation of the charge separation between the Ag NPs and the adsorbed thiol or thiophenol molecules. This work demonstrates the great potential of molecular adsorption in modulating the plasmon&#8208;mediated photochemistry, which will pave a new way for developing highly efficient plasmonic photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium(III) Complexes with [&#8722;2, &#8722;1, 0] Charged Ligand Realized Deep&#8208;Red/Near&#8208;Infrared Phosphorescent Emission</title>

         <dc:description>
New [&#8722;2, &#8722;1, 0] charged&#8208;ligand based iridium(III) complexes with simple chemical structures, good thermal stability and easy sublimability were designed and synthesized for the construction of novel phosphorescent iridium(III) complex materials. Deep red/near&#8208;infrared emissions were observed both in their photoluminescence and electroluminescence. This work provides a new idea for the construction of new type phosphorescent Ir(III) emitters with different charged ligands, thus offering new opportunities and challenges for their optoelectronic applications.







Abstract
A series of [&#8722;2, &#8722;1, 0] charged&#8208;ligand based iridium(III) complexes of [Ir(bph)(bpy)(acac)] (1), [Ir(bph)(2MeO&#8208;bpy)(acac)] (2), [Ir(bph)(2CF3&#8208;bpy)(acac)] (3), [Ir(bph)(bpy)(2tBu&#8208;acac)] (4) and [Ir(bph)(bpy)(CF3&#8208;acac)] (5), which using biphenyl as dianionic ligand [&#8722;2], acetylacetone (or its derivatives) as monoanionic ligand [&#8722;1], and 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (or its derivatives) as neutral ligand [0] were designed and synthesized. The chemical structures were well characterized. All of the ligands have simple chemical structures, thus further making the complexes have excellent thermal stability and are easy to sublimate and purify. Phosphorescent characteristics with short emission lifetime were demonstrated for these emitters. Notably, all of the complexes exhibit remarkable deep red/near infrared emission, which is quite different from the reported [&#8722;1, &#8722;1, &#8722;1] charged&#8208;ligand based iridium(III) complexes. The photophysical properties of these complexes are regularly improved by introducing electron&#8208;donating or &#8208;withdrawing groups into [&#8722;1] or [0] charged&#8208;ligand. The related organic light&#8208;emitting diodes exhibited deep red/near infrared emission with acceptable external quantum efficiency and low turn&#8208;on voltage (&lt;2.6&#8197;V). This work provides a new idea for the construction of new type phosphorescent iridium(III) emitters with different valence states of [&#8722;2, &#8722;1, 0] charged ligands, thus offering new opportunities and challenges for their optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Analysis of NH3&#8208;TPD Profiles for CuSSZ&#8208;13 SCR Catalyst of Controlled Al Distribution &#8211; Complexity Resolved by First Principles Thermodynamics of NH3 Desorption, IR and EPR Insight into Cu Speciation**

Interpretation of NH3&#8208;TPD results, which takes into account the temperature&#8208;induced dynamics of NH3 interaction with the active centers of CuSSZ&#8208;13 is proposed. It is based on DFT/GGA+D and first principles thermodynamic modeling of various monomeric and polymeric Cu species, segregated CuO and Br&#248;nsted acid sites. Comprehensive interpretation includes Cu reduction, its relocation and oxolation, which are concomitant with ammonia desorption.







Abstract
NH3 temperature&#8208;programmed desorption (NH3&#8208;TPD) is frequently used for probing the nature of the active sites in CuSSZ&#8208;13 zeolite for selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx. Herein, we propose an interpretation of NH3&#8208;TPD results, which takes into account the temperature&#8208;induced dynamics of NH3 interaction with the active centers. It is based on a comprehensive DFT/GGA+D and first&#8208;principles thermodynamic (FPT) modeling of NH3 adsorption on single Cu2+, Cu+, [CuOH]+ centers, dimeric [Cu&#8208;O&#8208;Cu]2+, [Cu&#8208;O22&#8722;&#8208;Cu]2 species, segregated CuO nanocrystals and Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS). Theoretical TPD profiles are compared with the experimental data measured for samples of various Si/Al ratios and distribution of Al within the zeolite framework. Copper reduction, its relocation, followed by the intrazeolite olation/oxolation processes, which are concomitant with NH3 desorption, were revealed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and IR. DFT/FPT results show that the peaks in the desorption profiles cannot be assigned univocally to the particular Cu and BAS centers, since the observed low&#8208;, medium&#8208; and high&#8208;temperature desorption bands have contributions coming from several species, which dynamically change their speciation and redox states during NH3&#8208;TPD experiment. Thus, a rigorous interpretation of the NH3&#8208;TPD profiles of CuSSZ&#8208;13 in terms of the strength and concentration of the active centers of a particular type is problematic. Nonetheless, useful connections for molecular interpretation of TPD profiles can be established between the individual component peaks and the corresponding ensembles of the adsorption centers.

         <title>Catechol Moiety Integrated Tri&#8208;Aryl Type AIEgen for Visual and Quantitative Boronic Acid Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double feature: Functional AIEgen TA&#8208;Catechol with dual&#8208;mode detection capability towards series of boronic acids is presented. Photoluminescent properties of TA&#8208;Catechol are studied thoroughly both experimentally and theoretically. Detection performance is estimated for visual and quantitative mode while formation of tetra&#8208;coordinated boronic compound is confirmed to dominate the sensing procedure. Solid&#8208;state recognition and potential applications are discussed.







Abstract
Novel functional AIEgen based on three compact bound aryl skeletons is designed and synthesized. This tri&#8208;aryl type luminogen (TA&#8208;Catechol) embedded with catechol moiety responds rapidly to series of boronic acids. Real&#8208;time visual and quantitative dual&#8208;mode detection method is established for the first time with modest precision and low detection limit (8.0&#8197;&#956;M). Detailed mechanistic discussion identifies tetra&#8208;coordinated boronic species as the key intermediate within sensing procedure. Wide range of organic boronic acids compatible with this strategy is displayed which is promising in high throughput screening technology. Furthermore, solid&#8208;state sensing capability of TA&#8208;Catechol is also demonstrated.

Mediated synthesis: A strategy for the nickel&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of ketones using visible light and two carboxylic acid&#8208;derived substrates is presented. No expensive iridium catalysts are required, with eco&#8208;friendly Hantzsch ester acting as both the photosensitizer and photoreductant. A broad scope of synthesized ketones is presented along with spectroscopical and computational studies of the role of the different reactants.







Abstract
A simple visible light photochemical, nickel&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of ketones from carboxylic acid&#8208;derived precursors is presented. Hantzsch ester (HE) functions as a cheap, green and strong photoreductant to facilitate radical generation and also engages in the Ni&#8208;catalytic cycle to restore the reactive species. With this dual role, HE allows for the coupling of a large variety of radicals (1&#176;,2&#176;, benzylic, &#945;&#8208;oxy &amp; &#945;&#8208;amino) with aroyl and alkanoyl moieties, a new feature in reactions of this type. With both precursors deriving from abundant carboxylic acids, this protocol is a welcome addition to the organic chemistry toolbox. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions without the need for toxic metal reagents or bases and shows a wide scope, including pharmaceuticals and complex molecular architectures.

The reaction of [(NacnacNi)2tol] with white phosphorus, yellow arsenic and the interpnictogen compound AsP3 leads in dependence of the temperature to different complexes ([(NacnacNi)2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;2,&#954;1:&#951;2,&#954;1&#8208;E4)] and the paramagnetic [(NacnacNi)2(&#956;,&#951;3&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8208;E3)] (E=P, As)). The reduction was performed with KC8 and leads to similar but also different structured products. Thus, a large variety of different polypnictogen units are formed coordinated by nickel nacnac complexes.







Abstract
The reactivity of white phosphorus and yellow arsenic towards two different nickel nacnac complexes is investigated. The nickel complexes [(L1Ni)2tol] (1, L1=[{N(C6H3iPr2&#8208;2,6)C(Me)}2CH]&#8722;) and [K2][(L1Ni)2(&#956;,&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8208;N2)] (6) were reacted with P4, As4 and the interpnictogen compound AsP3, respectively, yielding the homobimetallic complexes [(L1Ni)2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;2,&#954;1:&#951;2,&#954;1&#8208;E4)] (E=P (2&#8201;a), As (2&#8201;b), AsP3 (2&#8201;c)), [(L1Ni)2(&#956;,&#951;3&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8208;E3)] (E=P (3&#8201;a), As (3&#8201;b)) and [K@18&#8208;c&#8208;6(thf)2][L1Ni(&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8208;E4)] (E=P (7&#8201;a), As (7&#8201;b)), respectively. Heating of 2&#8201;a, 2&#8201;b or 2&#8201;c also leads to the formation of 3&#8201;a or 3&#8201;b. Furthermore, the reactivity of these compounds towards reduction agents was investigated, leading to [K2][(L1Ni)2(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8208;P4)] (4) and [K@18&#8208;c&#8208;6(thf)3][(L1Ni)2(&#956;,&#951;3&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8208;E3)] (E=P (5&#8201;a), As (5&#8201;b)), respectively. Compound 4 shows an unusual planarization of the initial Ni2P4&#8208;prism. All products were comprehensively characterized by crystallographic and spectroscopic methods.

         <title>Acid&#8208;Catalyzed RNA&#8208;Oligomerization from 3&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;cGMP</title>

Shedding new light on an old mechanism: Previous studies have suggested that the polymerization of 3&#8217;,5&#8217; cyclic guanosine monophosphate proceeds according to a base&#8208;catalyzed mechanism. In contrast, our work supports an acid&#8208;catalyzed reaction route that benefits from the unique ability of the free&#8208;acid form monomers to crystallize, and thus form highly ordered supramolecular architectures. The reaction could serve as a source of the most ancient short oligonucleotide sequences on our planet.







Abstract
The assembly of ancient informational polymers from nucleotide precursors is the central challenge of life's origin on our planet. Among the possible solutions, dry polymerization of 3&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;cyclic guanosine monophosphate (3&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;cGMP) has been proposed as a candidate to create oligonucleotides of 15&#8211;20&#8197;units in length. However, the reported sensitivity of the reaction to the presence of cations raised questions of whether this chemistry could be relevant in a geological context. The experiments in this study show that the presence of cations is not restrictive as long as the reaction is conducted in an acidic environment, in contrast to previous reports that suggested optimal conditions at pH&#8197;9.

         <title>Unveiling the Unique Roles of Metal Coordination and Modulator in the Polymorphism Control of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The extraordinary coordination versatility of Th4+ cation and the unexpected bridging role of formate allow polymorphism control of thorium&#8208;organic frameworks (TOFs) with five distinct phases, wherein the highest degree of interpenetration and porosity for TOFs have been achieved. The resulting TOFs exhibit considerably different adsorption behaviors toward organic dyes, thus suggesting that TOFs represent an excellent platform for structure&#8208;property relationship study.







Abstract
Polymorphism control of metal&#8208;organic frameworks is highly desired for elucidating structure&#8208;property relationships, but remains an empirical process and is usually done in a trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach. We adopted the rarely used actinide cation Th4+ and a ditopic linker to construct a series of thorium&#8208;organic frameworks (TOFs) with a range of polymorphs. The extraordinary coordination versatility of Th4+ cations and clusters, coupled with synthetic modulation, gives five distinct phases, wherein the highest degree of interpenetration (threefold) and porosity (75.9&#8201;%) of TOFs have been achieved. Notably, the O atom on the capping site of the nine&#8208;coordinated Th4+ cation can function as a bridging unit to interconnect neighboring secondary building units (SBUs), affording topologies that are undocumented for other tetravalent&#8208;metal&#8208;containing MOFs. Furthermore, for the first time HCOOH has been demonstrated as a bridging unit of SBUs to further induce structural complexity. The resulting TOFs exhibit considerably different adsorption behaviors toward organic dyes, thus suggesting that TOFs represent an exceptional and promising platform for structure&#8208;property relationship study.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymorphism control of metal-organic frameworks is highly desired for elucidating structure-property relationships, but remains an empirical process and is usually done in a trial-and-error approach. We adopted the rarely used actinide cation Th&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; and a ditopic linker to construct a series of thorium-organic frameworks (TOFs) with a range of polymorphs. The extraordinary coordination versatility of Th&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; cations and clusters, coupled with synthetic modulation, gives five distinct phases, wherein the highest degree of interpenetration (threefold) and porosity (75.9&#8201;%) of TOFs have been achieved. Notably, the O atom on the capping site of the nine-coordinated Th&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; cation can function as a bridging unit to interconnect neighboring secondary building units (SBUs), affording topologies that are undocumented for other tetravalent-metal-containing MOFs. Furthermore, for the first time HCOOH has been demonstrated as a bridging unit of SBUs to further induce structural complexity. The resulting TOFs exhibit considerably different adsorption behaviors toward organic dyes, thus suggesting that TOFs represent an exceptional and promising platform for structure-property relationship study.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tuning the Reactivity of a Substrate for SNAP&#8208;Tag Expands Its Application for Recognition&#8208;Driven DNA&#8208;Protein Conjugation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein modular adaptors (MAs) are the ideal reaction model for recognition&#8208;driven modification of DNA as they contain both a sequence&#8208;specific DNA&#8208;binding domain and a self&#8208;ligating protein&#8208;tag. We have designed new substrates of SNAP&#8208;tag to realize sequence&#8208;selective rapid crosslinking by protein MAs with SNAP&#8208;tag.







Abstract
Recognition&#8208;driven modification has been emerging as a novel approach to modifying biomolecular targets of interest site&#8208;specifically and efficiently. To this end, protein modular adaptors (MAs) are the ideal reaction model for recognition&#8208;driven modification of DNA as they consist of both a sequence&#8208;specific DNA&#8208;binding domain (DBD) and a self&#8208;ligating protein&#8208;tag. Coupling DNA recognition by DBD and the chemoselective reaction of the protein tag could provide a highly efficient sequence&#8208;specific reaction. However, combining an MA consisting of a reactive protein&#8208;tag and its substrate, for example, SNAP&#8208;tag and benzyl guanine (BG), revealed rather nonselective reaction with DNA. Therefore new substrates of SNAP&#8208;tag have been designed to realize sequence&#8208;selective rapid crosslinking reactions of MAs with SNAP&#8208;tag. The reactions of substrates with SNAP&#8208;tag were verified by kinetic analyses to enable the sequence&#8208;selective crosslinking reaction of MA. The new substrate enables the distinctive orthogonality of SNAP&#8208;tag against CLIP&#8208;tag to achieve orthogonal DNA&#8208;protein crosslinking by six unique MAs.

         <title>Dinuclear Zinc Catalyzed Enantioselective Dearomatization [3+2] Annulation of 2&#8208;Nitrobenzofurans and 2&#8208;Nitrobenzothiophenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective dearomatization [3+2] annulation of 2&#8208;nitrobenzofurans and 2&#8208;nitrobenzothiophenes is realized by a dinuclear zinc catalyst, giving structurally diverse polycyclic pyrrolidinyl spirooxindoles with high enantioselectivity. This work represents the first application of a dinuclear zinc catalyst in an asymmetric dearomatization reaction.







Abstract
The application of dinuclear zinc catalysts in a dearomatization reaction has been developed. Catalytic asymmetric dearomatization [3+2] annulations of 2&#8208;nitrobenzofurans or 2&#8208;nitrobenzothiophenes with CF3&#8208;containing N&#8208;unprotected isatin&#8208;derived azomethine ylides catalyzed by dinuclear zinc catalysts are realized with excellent diastereomer ratios (dr) of &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 and enantiomeric excess (ee) of up to 99&#8201;%. This protocol provides a practical, straightforward access to structurally diverse pyrrolidinyl spirooxindoles containing a 2,3&#8208;fused&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran (or dihydrobenzothiphene) moiety, and four contiguous stereocenters. Reactions can be performed on a gram scale. The absolute configuration of products is confirmed by X&#8208;ray single crystal structure analysis, and a possible mechanism is proposed.

         <title>Tuning Ruthenium Carbene Complexes for Selective P&#8722;H Activation through Metal&#8208;Ligand Cooperation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
P&#8722;H bond activation is an important step in many catalytic applications involving the formation of new P&#8722;C bonds. The icebreaker &#8220;RV Bond Activation&#8221;, which symbolizes our carbene complexes depicted by the constellation in the sky, is able to easily break P&#8722;H bonds via the carbene linkage. The splitting of phosphines into protons and phosphide fragments (depicted as ice shards flying away) occurs even at low temperatures. More information can be found in the Full Paper by V.&#8197;H. Gessner et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103151).

         <title>Stimuli Induced Uptake of Protein&#8208;Like Peptide Brush Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, we presented a strategy for packaging peptides as side&#8208;chains in high&#8208;density brush polymers. For this globular protein&#8208;like polymer (PLP) formulation, therapeutic peptides were shown to resist proteolytic degradation, enter cells efficiently and maintain biological function. In this paper, we establish the role charge plays in dictating the cellular uptake of these peptide formulations, finding that peptides with a net positive charge will enter cells when polymerized, while those formed from anionic or neutral peptides remain outside of cells. Given these findings, we explored whether cellular uptake could be selectively induced by a stimulus. In our design, a cationic peptide is appended to a sequence of charge&#8208;neutralizing anionic amino acids via stimuli&#8208;responsive cleavable linkers. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, we tested this strategy with two different classes of stimuli, exogenous UV light and an enzyme (a matrix metalloproteinase) associated with the inflammatory response. The key finding is that these materials enter cells only when acted upon by the stimulus. This approach makes it possible to achieve delivery of the polymers, therapeutic peptides or an appended cargo into cells in response to an appropriate stimulus.</dc:description>

         <title>Prebiotically plausible autocatalytic peptide amyloids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The prebiotic emergence of molecules capable of both self&#8208;replication and of storing information was a defining event at the dawn of life. Still, a plausibly prebiotic self&#8208;replication of biologically relevant molecules has not been demonstrated. Building upon the known templating nature of amyloids we present two systems in which the products of a peptide bond&#8208;forming reaction act as self&#8208;replicators to enhance the yield and stereoselectivity of their formation. This first report of an amino acid condensation reaction that can undergo autocatalysis further supports the potential role of amyloids in prebiotic molecular evolution as an environment&#8208;responsive and information&#8208;coding system capable of self&#8208;replication.</dc:description>

Sandwich time! In a study giving new ideas on the design of anion receptors, very strong anion&#8208;&#960; and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;anion interactions were calculated between halides and aromatic ligands in transition&#8208;metal half&#8208;sandwich compounds with electron&#8208;withdrawing ligands. The strongest interactions surpass the energy of &#8722;20&#8197;kcal/mol, which is stronger than anion&#8208;&#960; and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;anion interactions between halides and organic aromatic molecules.







Abstract
Half&#8208;sandwich compounds of benzene, cyclopentadienyl, pentamethylcyclopentadienyl, and indenyl were studied as a new type of aromatic &#960;&#8208;systems for interactions with halide anions. Although uncoordinated benzene forms only C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;anion interactions, and hexafluorobenzene forms only anion&#8208;&#960; interactions, aromatic ligands in half&#8208;sandwich compounds can form both types of interactions, because their entire electrostatic potential surface is positive. These aromatic ligands can form stronger anion&#8208;&#960; interactions than organic aromatic molecules, as a consequence of more pronounced dispersion and induction energy components. Moreover, C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;anion interactions of aromatic ligands are stronger than anion&#8208;&#960; interactions, and significantly stronger than C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;anion interactions of benzene. Our study shows that transition&#8208;metal coordination can make aromatic moieties suitable for strong interactions with anions, and gives insight into the design of new anion receptors.

         <title>4&#8208;Iodopyrimidine Labeling Reveals Nuclear Translocation and Nuclease Activity for Both MIF and MIF2**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein trafficking is an essential step for the functionalization of proteins. We report a 4&#8208;iodopyrimidine based probe 8 for the selective labeling of MIF and MIF2. This enabled monitoring of the translocation of MIF2 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus upon methylnitronitrosoguanidine stimulation, which indicates a nuclease activity for MIF2 on human genomic DNA. Thus, we provide a tool for MIF and MIF2 localization study, as well as demonstrate a nuclease activity for MIF2.







Abstract
Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and its homolog MIF2 (also known as D&#8208;dopachrome tautomerase or DDT) play key roles in cell growth and immune responses. MIF and MIF2 expression is dysregulated in cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. Accurate and convenient detection of MIF and MIF2 will facilitate research on their roles in cancer and other diseases. Herein, we report the development and application of a 4&#8208;iodopyrimidine based probe 8 for the selective labeling of MIF and MIF2. Probe 8 incorporates a fluorophore that allows in&#8197;situ imaging of these two proteins. This enabled visualization of the translocation of MIF2 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus upon methylnitronitrosoguanidine stimulation of HeLa cells. This observation, combined with literature on nuclease activity for MIF, enabled the identification of nuclease activity for MIF2 on human genomic DNA.

         <title>Coordination&#8208;induced band gap reduction in a metal&#8208;organic framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report on the synthesis of a microporous, three&#8208;dimensional phosphonate metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) with the composition Cu  3  (H  5  &#8208;MTPPA)  2  &#183;2 NMP (H  8  &#8208;MTPPA = methane tetra&#8208;  p  &#8208;phenylphosphonic acid and NMP = N&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidone). This MOF, termed TUB1, has a unique one&#8208;dimensional inorganic building unit composed of square planar and distorted trigonal bipyramidal copper atoms. It possesses a (calculated) BET surface area of 766.2 m  2  /g after removal of the solvents from the voids. The Tauc plot for TUB1 yields indirect and direct band gaps of 2.4 eV and 2.7 eV, respectively. DFT calculations reveal the existence of two spin&#8208;dependent gaps of 2.60 eV and 0.48 eV for the alpha and beta spins, respectively, with the lowest unoccupied crystal orbital for both gaps predominantly residing on the square planar copper atoms. The projected density of states suggests that the presence of the square planar copper atoms reduces the overall band gap of TUB1, as the beta&#8208;gap for the trigonal bipyramidal copper atoms is 3.72 eV.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sensing strategies for dual detection systems are of interest for rapid, accurate data collection in  in vitro  testing. We introduce an Ir(III) complex with a boronic acid binding receptor site on the 2&#8208;phenylpyridine ligand as an ideal probe with photo&#8208; and electro&#8208; chemical signals, sensitive to changes of monosaccharide binding. The complex displays orange luminescence at 618 nm which is reduced in intensity upon binding of the monosaccharides, 70 % and 40% for fructose and glucose, respectively. The electrochemiluminescent signal of the complex shows a direct response to monosaccharide binding. The complex&#8217;s luminescence is also responsive to monosaccharide presence in cancer cells. The Ir(III) complex shows the same response upon incorporation into hydrogel matrices, demonstrating the potential of its integration into a device, as a non&#8208;toxic, simple to use tool to observe sugar binding in physiologically relevant pH ranges and saccharide concentrations.</dc:description>

         <title>Pushing the limits of characterising a weak halogen bond in solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Detection and characterisation of very weak, non&#8208;covalent interactions in solution is inherently challenging. Low affinity, short complex lifetime and a constant battle against entropy brings even the most sensitive spectroscopic methods to their knees. Herein we introduce a strategy for the accurate experimental description of weak chemical forces in solution. Its scope is demonstrated by the detailed geometric and thermodynamic characterisation of the weak halogen bond of a non&#8209;fluorinated aryl iodide and an ether oxygen (0.6&#160;kJ mol  &#8209;1  ). Our approach makes use of the entropic advantage of studying a weak force intramolecularly, embedded into a cooperatively folding system, and of the combined use of NOE&#8208; and RDC&#8208;based ensemble analyses to accurately describe the orientation of the donor and acceptor sites. Thermodynamic constants (&#916;G, &#916;H and &#916;S), describing the specific interaction, were derived from variable temperature chemical shift analysis. We present a methodology for the experimental investigation of remarkably weak halogen bonds and other related weak forces in solution, paving the way for their improved understanding and strategic use in chemistry and biology.</dc:description>

Its scope is demonstrated by the detailed geometric and thermodynamic characterisation of the weak halogen bond of a non&#8209;fluorinated aryl iodide and an ether oxygen (0.6&#160;kJ mol  &#8209;1  ). Our approach makes use of the entropic advantage of studying a weak force intramolecularly, embedded into a cooperatively folding system, and of the combined use of NOE- and RDC-based ensemble analyses to accurately describe the orientation of the donor and acceptor sites. Thermodynamic constants (&#916;G, &#916;H and &#916;S), describing the specific interaction, were derived from variable temperature chemical shift analysis. We present a methodology for the experimental investigation of remarkably weak halogen bonds and other related weak forces in solution, paving the way for their improved understanding and strategic use in chemistry and biology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>THE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OF A SECOND METAL ON THE ANTIPROLIFERATIVE PROPERTIES OF THE COMPLEX [Ru(&#951;6&#8208;C10H14)(Cl2)(dmoPTA)].</title>

The crystal structure of 1, 3 and 5 were obtained by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Antiproliferative activity of the complexes was evaluated against colon cancer cell line Caco&#8208;2/TC7 by using the MTT protocol. The monometallic ruthenium complexes 1 and 2 were found to be inactive but the bimetallic complexes 3, 4 and 5 display an increased activity (IC  50  3: 9.07&#177;0.27; IC  50  4: 5.40&#177;0.19; IC  50  5: 7.15&#177;0.30 (&#181;M)) compared to cisplatin (IC  50  = 45.6&#177;8.08 &#181;M). Importantly, no reduction in normal cell viability was observed in the presence of the complexes. Experiments targeted to obtain information on the possible action mechanism of complexes were performed such as cell cycle, ROS and gene expression studies. The result obtained showed that the complexes display different properties and action mechanism depending on the nature of metal, M, bonded to the CH  3  N  dmoPTA  atoms.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The phenomenon of single molecule magnet (SMM) behaviour of mixed valent Mn  12  coordination clusters of general formula [Mn  III  8  Mn  IV  4  O  12  (RCOO)  16  (H  2  O)  4  ] was exemplified by bulk samples of the archetypal [Mn  III  8  Mn  IV  4  O  12  (CH  3  COO)  16  (H  2  O)  4  ] molecule. The molecular origin of the observed magnetic behaviour has found support from extensive studies on the Mn  12  system within crystalline material or on molecules attached to a variety of surfaces.

Furthermore, we report broken symmetry DFT calculations of spin densities and single ion tensors of the isolated, optimized complexes [Mn  12  O  12  (CH  3  COO)  15  (CH  3  CN)]  +  , [Mn  12  O  12  (CH  3  COO)  16  ], [Mn  12  O  12  (CH  3  COO)  16  (H  2  O)  4  ], and [Mn  III  8  Mn  IV  4  O  12  (CH  3  COO)  16  (H  2  O)  4  ]  (bulk geometry)  . The found magnetic fingerprints &#8211; experiment and theory alike &#8208; are of a remarkable robustness: The Mn  IV  4  core bears almost no magnetic anisotropy while the surrounding Mn  III  8  ring is highly anisotropic. These signatures are truly intrinsic properties of the Mn  12  core scaffold within all of these complexes and largely void of the environment. This likely holds irrespective of bulk packing effects.</dc:description>

         <title>TADF&#8208;Sensitized Fluorescent Enantiomers: A New Strategy for High&#8208;Efficiency Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A promising strategy of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) sensitized circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) has been proposed for improving the electroluminescence efficiencies of circularly polarized fluorescent emitters. Compared with chiral TADF emitters which suffer from the dilemma of small &#8710;  E  ST  accompanied by small  k  r  , the TADF&#8208;sensitized CPL (TSCP) strategy using TADF molecules as sensitizers and CP&#8208;FL molecules as emitters might be the most promising method to construct high&#8208;performance circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs). Consequently, by taking advantage of the theoretically 100% exciton utilization of TADF sensitizers, especially, by designing CP&#8208;FL emitters with high PLQY, narrow FWHM and large g  lum  values, TSCP&#8208;type CP&#8208;OLEDs with excellent overall performances can be realized.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The lasso peptide benenodin&#8208;1, a naturally occurring and bacterially produced [1]rotaxane, undergoes a reversible zip tie&#8208;like motion under heat activation, in which a peptidic wheel stepwise translates along a molecular thread in a cascade of &#8220;tail/loop pulling&#8221; equilibria. Conformational and structural analyses of four translational isomers, in solution and in the gas phase, reveal that the equilibrium distribution is controlled by mechanical and non&#8208;covalent forces within the lasso peptide. Furthermore, each dynamic pulling step is accompanied by a major restructuring of the intramolecular hydrogen bonding network between wheel and thread, which affects the peptide&#8217;s physico&#8208;chemical properties.</dc:description>

Based on the concomitant generation of both the nucleophilic and the electrophilic poles by hydrozirconation of the amide and the C=C double bond, the cyclisation may be tuned towards cyclopentanols or  N,O  &#8208;dimethylcyclopentylhydroxylamines depending on the ring&#8208;closure promotor. An extension to cis 3&#8208;substituted  N,O  &#8208;dimethylcyclohexylhydroxylamines is also presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Domino Dehydrative &#960;&#8208;Extension: A Facile Path to Extended Perylenes and Terrylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective activation of identical functional groups is one of the most challenging tasks in the realm of organic chemistry. Dehydrative &#960;&#8208;extensions (DPEX) is a reaction that distinguishes &#8220;active&#8221; and &#8220;dormant&#8221; aldehyde groups based on their position and ability to participate in intramolecular reactions. This unusual feature allows the method to be used for programmed domino folding, in which aldehyde groups are activated sequentially in accordance with the program inbuilt into the precursor's structure. More information can be found in the Communication by K. Amsharov et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103098).

         <title>Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Haloalkynylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal catalysts can be used to react haloacetylenes with unsaturated compounds such as arynes, alkenes and alkynes, whereby the alkynyl unit and the halogen atom are usually added to adjacent positions. Cu, Pd and Au metal complexes have so far proved to be particularly suitable catalysts. The choice of catalyst system decisively determines the regio&#8208; and stereochemistry of the resulting halogenated product.







Abstract
Metal catalysis has revolutionized synthetic chemistry, leading to entirely new, very efficient transformations, which enable access to complex functionalized molecules. One such new transformation method is the haloalkynylation reaction, in which both a halogen atom and an alkynyl unit are transferred to an unsaturated carbon&#8208;carbon bond. This minireview summarizes the development of metal&#8208;catalyzed haloalkynylation reactions since their beginning about a decade ago. So far, arynes, alkenes and alkynes have been used as unsaturated systems and the reactivities of these systems are summarized in individual chapters of the minireview. Especially, the last few years have witnessed a rapid development due to gold&#8208;catalyzed reactions. Here, we discuss how the choice of the catalytic system influences the regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity of the addition.

         <title>Rhodium Indenyl NHC and Fluorenyl&#8208;Tethered NHC Half&#8208;Sandwich Complexes: Synthesis, Structures and Applications in the Catalytic C&#8722;H Borylation of Arenes and Alkanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indenyl rhodium NHC complexes with labile alkene ligands (ethene and cyclooctene) have been synthesized and shown to be better catalysts than the related fluorenyl&#8208;tethered NHC rhodium complexes for the C&#8722;H activation and borylation of arenes and alkanes.







Abstract
Indenyl (Ind) rhodium N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes [Rh(&#951;5&#8208;Ind)(NHC)(L)] were synthesised for 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydroimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (SIPr) with L=C2H4 (1), CO (2&#8201;a) and cyclooctene (COE; 3), for 1,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydroimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (SIMes) with L=CO (2&#8201;b) and COE (4), and 1,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (IMes) with L=CO (2&#8201;c) and COE (5). Reaction of SIPr with [Rh(Cp*)(C2H4)2] did not give the desired SIPr complex, thus demonstrating the &#8220;indenyl effect&#8221; in the synthesis of 1. Oxidative addition of HSi(OEt)3 to 3 proceeded under mild conditions to give the Rh silyl hydride complex [Rh(Ind){Si(OEt)3}(H)(SIPr)] (6) with loss of COE. Tethered&#8208;fluorenyl NHC rhodium complexes [Rh{(&#951;5&#8208;C13H8)C2H4N(C)C2HxNR}(L)] (x=4, R=Dipp, L=C2H4: 11; L=COE: 12; L=CO: 13; R=Mes, L=COE: 14; L=CO: 15; x=2, R=Me, L=COE: 16; L=CO: 17) were synthesised in low yields (5&#8211;31&#8201;%) in comparison to good yields for the monodentate complexes (49&#8211;79&#8201;%). Compounds 3 and 1, which contain labile alkene ligands, were successful catalysts for the catalytic borylation of benzene with B2pin2 (Bpin=pinacolboronate, 97 and 93&#8201;% PhBpin respectively with 5&#8197;mol&#8201;% catalyst, 24&#8197;h, 80&#8201;&#176;C), with SIPr giving a more active catalyst than SIMes or IMes. Fluorenyl&#8208;tethered NHC complexes were much less active as borylation catalysts, and the carbonyl complexes were inactive. The borylation of toluene, biphenyl, anisole and diphenyl ether proceeded to give meta substitutions as the major product, with smaller amounts of para substitution and almost no ortho product. The borylation of octane and decane with B2pin2 at 120 and 140&#8201;&#176;C, respectively, was monitored by 11B NMR spectroscopy, which showed high conversions into octyl and decylBpin over 4&#8211;7&#8197;days, thus demonstrating catalysed sp3 C&#8722;H borylation with new piano stool rhodium indenyl complexes. Irradiation of the monodentate complexes with 400 or 420&#8197;nm light confirmed the ready dissociation of C2H4 and COE ligands, whereas CO complexes were inert. Evidence for C&#8722;H bond activation in the alkyl groups of the NHC ligands was obtained.

         <title>Strong Ligand Stabilization Based on &#960;&#8208;Extension in a Series of Ruthenium Terpyridine Water Oxidation Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water oxidation catalysis on a series of ruthenium(II) terpyridine complexes shows a correlation between catalytic performance and the extension of their &#960; bidentate ligand. Substitution of the Cl&#8722; ligand by H2O reveals increased stability of the Ru&#8722;Cl bond upon increasing the &#960;&#8208;system. Computational studies demonstrated how the greater stability of the Cl&#8722; ligand negatively influences O2 evolution despite the reaction energy barriers of water oxidation being identical among all complexes.

The unsaturated bicyclo[1.1.0]tetrasilatetraamide Si4{N(Mes)SiMe3}4 shown in the upper right corner has two threefold&#8208;coordinated silicon atoms that show zwitterionic character. This gives the molecule intramolecular FLP&#8208;type character. Different acids such as AlBr3, BH3, H+ and the base NHCMe4 can simply coordinate to the threefold&#8208;coordinated silicon atoms. These reagents &#8220;click&#8221; in place just like magnetic sticks and steel balls from a molecular construction kit do. More information can be found in the Full Paper by F. Lips et&#8197;al.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Pulvomycin D</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A synthetic route to the pulvomycin class of natural products is presented, which culminated in the first synthesis of a pulvomycin, pulvomycin D. Key elements of the strategy include a pivotal aldol reaction which led to bond formation between the C24&#8208;C40 and the C8&#8208;C23 fragment. The remaining C1&#8208;C7 fragment was attached by a Yamaguchi esterification completing the assembly of the 40 carbon atoms within the main skeleton. Ring closure to the 22&#8208;membered lactone ring was achieved in the final stages of the synthesis by a Heck reaction. The completion of the synthesis required the removal of six silyl protecting groups in combination with olefin formation at C26&#8208;C27 by a Peterson elimination.</dc:description>

         <title>Crown Ether Host&#8208;Guest Molecular Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, molecular ferroelectrics have received great attention due to their lightweight, mechanical flexibility, easy preparation and excellent ferroelectric properties. Among them, crown ether&#8208;based molecular ferroelectrics, which are typically composed of the host crown ethers, the guest cations anchored in the crown ethers, and the counterions, are of great interest because of the host&#8208;guest structure. Such a structure allows the components to occur order&#8208;disorder transition easily, which is beneficial for inducing ferroelectric phase transition. Herein, we summarized the research progress of crown ether host&#8208;guest molecular ferroelectrics, focusing on their crystal structure, phase transition, ferroelectric&#8208;related properties. In view of the small spontaneous polarization and uniaxial nature, we outlook the chemical design strategies for obtaining high&#8208;performance crown ether&#8208;based molecular ferroelectrics. This minireview will be of guiding significance for the future exploration of crown ether host&#8208;guest molecular ferroelectrics.</dc:description>

         <title>Steric Repulsion Induced Conformational Switch in Supramolecular Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by the rigidified architecture of &#8216;picket&#8208;fence&#8217; systems, we propose a strategy utilizing strain in already peripherally overcrowded structures to impose intramolecular tension for selective atropisomeric conversion. Employing this approach, tunable shape&#8208;persistent porphyrin conformations were acquired exhibiting distinctive supramolecular nanostructures based on the orientation of the peripheral groups. The developed molecular strain engineering methodologies have allowed the introduction of the pivalic units creating a highly strained molecular skeleton. Changes in absorption spectrum indicated the presence of severe steric repulsions which were confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. To release the steric strain introduced by the peripheral units, thermal equilibration strategies were used to selectively convert the most abundant atropisomer to the desirable minor one.</dc:description>

         <title>Tris(tetramethylguanidinyl)phosphine: The simplest non&#8208;ionic phosphorus superbase and strongly&#8208;donating phosphine ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis and properties of the much sought&#8208;after tris(1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethylguanidinyl) phosphine P(tmg)  3  , a crystalline, superbasic phosphine accessible through a short and scalable procedure from the cheap and commercially available bulk chemicals 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethylguanidine, tris(dimethylamino)phosphine and phosphorus trichloride. The new phosphine exhibits exceptional electron donor properties and readily forms transition metal complexes with gold(I), palladium(II) and rhodium(I) precursors. The formation of zwitterionic Lewis base adducts with carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide was explored. In addition, the complete series of phosphine chalcogenides was prepared from the reaction of P(tmg)  3  with N  2  O and the elemental chalcogens.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>This report describes the synthesis of a [2.2]paracyclophane&#8208;derived annulated 3&#8208;amino&#8208;imidazole ligand library  via  a Groebke&#8211;Blackburn&#8211;Bienaym&#233; three&#8208;component reaction (GBB&#8208;3CR) employing formyl&#8208;cyclophanes in combination with diverse aliphatic and aromatic isocyanides and heteroaromatic amidines. The GBB&#8208;3CR gives access to differently functionalized skeletally&#8208;diverse cyclophanyl imidazole ligands, namely 3&#8208;amino&#8208;imidazo[1,2&#8208;  a  ]pyridines and imidazo[1,2&#8208;  a  ]pyrazines. Additionally, a one&#8208;pot protocol for the GBB&#8208;3CR by an  in&#8208;situ  generation of cyclophanyl isocyanide is demonstrated. The product formation was analyzed by detailed spectroscopic techniques, and a cyclophanyl imidazo[1,2&#8208;  a  ]pyridine was confirmed unambiguously by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;Ray crystallography. The cyclophanyl imidazole ligands can be readily transformed to showcase their useful utility in preparing  N  ,  C  &#8208;palladacycles  via  regioselective  ortho  &#8208;palladation.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;heme&#8208;iron&#8208;mediated selective halogenation of unactivated carbon&#8208;hydrogen bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidation of the iron(II) precursor [(L  1  )Fe  II  Cl  2  ] with soluble iodosylbenzene  s  PhIO, where L  1  is a tetradentate bispidine, leads to the extremely reactive ferryl oxidant [(L  1  )(Cl)Fe  IV  =O]  +  with a  cis  disposition of the chlorido and oxido coligands as observed in nonheme halogenase enzymes. Experimental data indicate that, with cyclohexane as substrate, there is selective formation of chlorocyclohexane, where the halogenation is initiated by C&#8208;H abstraction and the result of a rebound of the ensuing radical to an iron&#8208;bound Cl  &#8208;  . The time&#8208;resolved formation of the halogenation product indicates that this primarily results from  s  PhIO oxidation of an initially formed oxido&#8208;bridged diiron(III) resting state. The high yield of up to over 70% (stoichiometric reaction) as well as the differing reactivities of free Fe  2+  and Fe  3+  in comparison with [(L  1  )Fe  II  Cl  2  ] indicate a high complex stability of the bispidine&#8208;iron complexes. A DFT analysis shows that, due to a large driving force and small triplet&#8208;quintet gap, in comparison to other small molecule halogenase models [(L  1  )(Cl)Fe  IV  =O]  +  is the most reactive, that the Fe  III  / radical rebound intermediate has a relatively long lifetime, supported by experimentally observed cage escape, and that this intermediate has, as observed experimentally, a lower energy barrier to the halogenation than the hydroxylation product, and this is shown to primarily be due to steric effects.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Oxidation of the iron(II) precursor [(L  1  )Fe  II  Cl  2  ] with soluble iodosylbenzene  s  PhIO, where L  1  is a tetradentate bispidine, leads to the extremely reactive ferryl oxidant [(L  1  )(Cl)Fe  IV  =O]  +  with a  cis  disposition of the chlorido and oxido coligands as observed in nonheme halogenase enzymes. Experimental data indicate that, with cyclohexane as substrate, there is selective formation of chlorocyclohexane, where the halogenation is initiated by C-H abstraction and the result of a rebound of the ensuing radical to an iron-bound Cl  -  .

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Amination of Drug&#8208;Like Benzoic Acids: Access to Anilines and Drug Conjugates through Directed Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Added at the eleventh hour: A method for the late&#8208;stage directed amination of benzoic acids is presented. It allows rapid access to both small amino&#8208;functionalized analogues and large conjugates, including PROTACs, peptide conjugates and probes for chemical biology. Selection of the right catalyst and reagent enabled the use of high&#8208;throughput experimentation and automation.







Abstract
The functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds, ubiquitous in drugs and drug&#8208;like molecules, represents an important synthetic strategy with the potential to streamline the drug&#8208;discovery process. Late&#8208;stage aromatic C&#8722;N bond&#8211;forming reactions are highly desirable, but despite their significance, accessing aminated analogues through direct and selective amination of C&#8722;H bonds remains a challenging goal. The method presented herein enables the amination of a wide array of benzoic acids with high selectivity. The robustness of the system is manifested by the large number of functional groups tolerated, which allowed the amination of a diverse array of marketed drugs and drug&#8208;like molecules. Furthermore, the introduction of a synthetic handle enabled expeditious access to targeted drug&#8208;delivery conjugates, PROTACs, and probes for chemical biology. This rapid access to valuable analogues, combined with operational simplicity and applicability to high&#8208;throughput experimentation has the potential to aid and considerably accelerate drug discovery.

         <title>Development of an Enzyme&#8208;Inhibitor Reaction Using Cellular Retinoic Acid Binding Protein II for One&#8208;Pot Megamolecule Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic retinoid covalent inhibitor that targets the nucleophilic tyrosine residue in cellular retinoic acid binding protein II (CRABP2) in mild conditions was developed. This enzyme&#8208;inhibitor pair was integrated into the megamolecule assembly strategy to construct protein scaffolds in one&#8208;pot reactions. Here, three orthogonal enzyme&#8208;inhibitor reactions occurred simultaneously to form a homogeneous product without the use of protecting groups.







Abstract
This paper presents an enzyme building block for the assembly of megamolecules. The system is based on the inhibition of the human&#8208;derived cellular retinoic acid binding protein II (CRABP2) domain. We synthesized a synthetic retinoid bearing an arylfluorosulfate group, which uses sulfur fluoride exchange click chemistry to covalently inhibit CRABP2. We conjugated both the inhibitor and a fluorescein tag to an oligo(ethylene glycol) backbone and measured a second&#8208;order rate constant for the protein inhibition reaction of approximately 3,600&#8197;M&#8722;1s&#8722;1. We used this new enzyme&#8208;inhibitor pair to assemble multi&#8208;protein structures in one&#8208;pot reactions using three orthogonal assembly chemistries to demonstrate exact control over the placement of protein domains within a single, homogeneous molecule. This work enables a new dimension of control over specificity, orientation, and stoichiometry of protein domains within atomically precise nanostructures.

         <title>Afterglow Implant for Arterial Embolization and Intraoperative Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) is wildly used in clinical treatments. However, the online monitoring of the thrombosis formation is limited due to the challenges of the direct visualization of embolic agents and the real&#8208;time monitoring of dynamic blood flow. Thus, we developed a photochemical afterglow implant with strong afterglow intensity and a long lifetime for embolization and imaging. The liquid pre&#8208;implant injected into the abdominal aorta of mice was rapidly transformed into a hydrogel  in situ  to embolize the blood vessel. The vascular embolism position can be observed by the enhanced afterglow of the fixed implant, and the long lifetime of afterglow can also be used to monitor the effect of embolization. This provides an excellent candidate in bio&#8208;imaging to avoid the autofluorescence interference from continuous light excitation. The study suggests the potential usefulness of the implant as an embolic agent in TAE and artery imaging during a surgical procedure.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering the role of anions and secondary coordination sphere in tuning anisotropy in Dy(III) air&#8208;stable D5h SIMs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise control of the crystal field and symmetry around the paramagnetic spin centre has recently facilitated the engineering of high&#8208;temperature single&#8208;ion magnets (SIMs), the smallest possible units for future spin&#8208;based devices.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Precise control of the crystal field and symmetry around the paramagnetic spin centre has recently facilitated the engineering of high-temperature single-ion magnets (SIMs), the smallest possible units for future spin-based devices.

         <title>Platinum&#8208;tin/tin oxide/CNT catalysts for high&#8208;performance electrocatalytic ethanol oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ethanol is a promising liquid clean energy source in the energy conversion field. However, the self&#8208;poisoning caused by the strongly adsorbed reaction intermediates (typically, CO) is a critical problem in ethanol oxidation reaction. To address this issue, we proposed a joint use of two strategies, alloying of Pt with other metals and building Pt/metal&#8208;oxide interfaces, to achieve high&#8208;performance electrocatalytic ethanol oxidation. For this, a well&#8208;designed synthetic route combining wet impregnation with a two&#8208;step thermal treatment process was established to construct PtSn/SnO  x  interfaces on carbon nanotubes. Using this route, the alloying of Pt&#8208;Sn and formation of PtSn&#8208;SnO  x  interfaces can simultaneously be achieved, and the coverage of SnO  x  thin films on PtSn alloy nanoparticles can be facilely tuned by the strong interaction between Pt and SnO  x  . The results revealed that the partial coverage of SnO  x  species not only retained the active sites, but also enhanced the CO anti&#8208;poisoning ability of the catalyst. Consequently, the H&#8208;PtSn/SnO  x  /CNT&#8208;2 catalyst with an optimized PtSn&#8208;SnO  x  interface showed significantly improved performances toward the ethanol oxidation reaction (825 mA mg  Pt  &#8722;1  ). This study provides deep insights into the structure&#8208;performance relationship of PtSn/metal oxide composite catalysts, which would be helpful for the future design and fabrication of high&#8208;performance Pt&#8208;based ethanol oxidation reaction catalysts.</dc:description>

To address this issue, we proposed a joint use of two strategies, alloying of Pt with other metals and building Pt/metal-oxide interfaces, to achieve high-performance electrocatalytic ethanol oxidation. For this, a well-designed synthetic route combining wet impregnation with a two-step thermal treatment process was established to construct PtSn/SnO  x  interfaces on carbon nanotubes.

         <title>Indeno[1,2,3,4&#8208;pqra]perylene: A Medium&#8208;Sized Aromatic Hydrocarbon Exhibiting Full&#8208;Range Visible&#8208;Light Absorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis and properties of indeno[1,2,3,4&#8208; pqra ]perylene, which was prepared by the fusion of one anthracene unit with one naphthalene unit via three carbon&#8211;carbon bonds. The synthetic route through two&#8208;fold C&#8211;H arylation enabled not only the synthesis of unsubstituted indenoperylene, but also rapid access to its arylated derivatives on the gram scale. Indenoperylene is a medium&#8208;sized aromatic hydrocarbon with the composition C 24 H 12 that is isomeric to coronene. Nevertheless, its absorption covers the entire visible region owing to its small HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap. Furthermore, indenoperylene exhibits high stability despite the absence of peripheral substituents. We propose that the unique electronic structure of indenoperylene originates from the coexistence of an electron&#8208;withdrawing subunit (benzoaceanthrylene) and an electron&#8208;donating subunit (perylene). The electronic properties of indenoperylene were modulated via post&#8208;functionalization through regioselective bromination. The current research demonstrates that indenoperylene is a promising candidate as a main skeleton for near&#8208;infrared&#8208;responsive and redox&#8208;active materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin&#8208;spin Coupling Controls the Gas&#8208;phase Reactivity of Aromatic &#963;&#8208;Type Triradicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Examination of the reactions of &#963;&#8208;type quinolinium&#8208;based triradicals with cyclohexane in the gas phase demonstrated that  the radical site that is the least strongly coupled to the other two radical sites reacts first, independent of the intrinsic reactivity of this radical site,  in contrast to related biradicals that first react at the most  electron&#8208;deficient  radical site. Abstraction of one or two H atoms and formation of an ion that formally corresponds to a combination of the ion and cyclohexane accompanied by elimination of a H atom (&#8220;addition &#8211; H&#8221;) were observed. In all cases except one, the most reactive radical site of the triradicals is  intrinsically less reactive  than the other two radical sites. The product complex of the H abstraction either dissociates to give the H atom abstraction product and the cyclohexyl radical or the more reactive radical site in the produced biradical abstracts a H atom from the cyclohexyl radical. The monoradical product can add&#160;to cyclohexene followed by elimination of a H atom, generating the &#8220;addition &#8211; H&#8221; products. Similar reaction efficiencies were measured for three of the triradicals as for relevant monoradicals. Surprisingly, the remaining three triradicals (all with&#160;a  meta  &#8208;pyridyne moiety)  reacted substantially faster than the relevant monoradicals  . This is rationalized based on the exothermic generation of the same  meta  &#8208;pyridyne analog for these three triradicals has enough energy to attain  the dehydrocarbon atom separation common for H atom abstraction transition states  of protonated  meta  &#8208;pyridynes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The formation, and subsequent structural, thermal and adsorptive properties of single&#8208;component metal&#8211;organic framework crystal&#8208;glass composites (MOF&#8208;CGCs) are investigated.

X&#8208;ray diffraction showed that the crystalline phase was still present after heating to above the glass transition temperature of  agZIF&#8208;62(Zn), and interfacial compatibility between the crystalline and glassy phases was investigated using a mixed&#8208;metal (ZIF&#8208;62(Co))0.5(agZIF&#8208;62(Zn))0.5 analogue.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Several novel binaphthyl&#8208;based chiral hypervalent iodine(III) reagents have been prepared and structurally analyzed. Various asymmetric oxidative reactions were applied to evaluate the reactivities and stereoselectivities of those reagents. Moderate to excellent yields were observed, however, very low stereoselectivities were obtained. The NMR experiments indicate that these reagents are very easily hydrolyzed in either chloroform or DMSO solvents leading to limited stereoselectivities. It is concluded that the use of chiral ligands is an unsuccessful way to prepare efficient stereoselective iodine(III) reagents.</dc:description>

         <title>From Thioureas to Thioquinolines through Isolated Benzothiazines by Gold Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of new benzothiazine heterocycles have been achieved starting from thiourea derivatives and using different gold catalysts. The catalyst and the conditions have been optimised towards the selective synthesis of 6&#8208;membered benzothiazine heterocycles, characterised by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Interestingly, these organic compounds evolved under gold catalysis in basic medium to achieve the formation of amino thioquinolines through an unprecedented aromatisation process of the heterocycle. The reaction has also been carried out stoichiometrically by reaction of gold complexes to afford the thioquinolines coordinated to the gold fragment. Benzothiazine, amino thioquinoline heterocycles and gold derived species have a great potential for biological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Fe&#8208;ZIF8 Coating Cu Foil Derived Carbon as A pH&#8208;universal Electrocatalyst for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is a great challenge to fabricate highly efficient pH&#8208;universal electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, a facile strategy, which includes coating the Fe modified ZIF8 on Cu foil and in&#8208;situ pyrolysis to evaporate and dope Cu into the MOF derived carbon, is developed to fabricate Fe/Cu&#8208;N co&#8208;doped carbon material (Cu/Fe&#8208;NC). Profiting from the modulated electron distribution and textual properties, well&#8208;designed Cu/Fe&#8208;NC exhibits superior half&#8208;wave potential (E  1/2  ) of 0.923 V in alkaline, 0.757 V in neutral and comparable 0.801 V in acid electrolytes, respectively. Furthermore, the ultralow peroxides yield of ORR demonstrates the high selectivity of Cu/Fe&#8208;NC in full pH scale electrolytes. As expected, the self&#8208;made alkaline and neutral zinc&#8208;air batteries equipped with Cu/Fe&#8208;NC cathode display excellent discharge voltages, outstanding peak power densities and remarkable stability. This work opens a new way to fabricate highly efficient and pH&#8208;universal electrocatalysts for ORR through strategy of Fe/Cu&#8208;N co&#8208;doping, Cu foil evaporation and carbon defects capture.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We successfully isolated and characterized the zinc carbamate complex (phen)Zn(OAc)(OC(=O)NHPh) (  1  , phen = 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline), formed as an intermediate during the Zn(OAc)  2  /phen&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of organic carbamates from CO  2  , amines, and the reusable reactant Si(OMe)  4  . Density functional theory calculations revealed that the direct reaction of  1  with Si(OMe)  4  proceeds via a 5&#8208;coordinate silicon intermediate, forming organic carbamates. Based on these results, the catalytic system was improved by using Si(OMe)  4  as the reaction solvent and additives like KOMe and KF, which promote the formation of the 5&#8208;coordinated silicon species. This sustainable and effective method can be used to synthesize various  N  &#8208;aryl and  N  &#8208;alkyl carbamates, including industrially important polyurethane raw materials, starting from CO  2  under atmospheric pressure.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cervical cancer, as a common malignant tumor of reproductive system, seriously threatens women's life and health. Traditional treatments, including surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, are difficult to cure cervical cancer. Fortunately, tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;activated catalytic therapy with high efficiency and reduced off&#8208;target toxicity has emerged as a novel treatment model. Herein, we designed &#8220;four&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; nanozyme and natural enzyme symbiotic system of Cu  2&#8208;x  Se&#8208;GOx for TME&#8208;triggered cascaded catalytic enhanced cancer treatment. In response to unique TME, the Cu  2&#8208;x  Se with catalase activity could effectively catalyze over&#8208;expressed H  2  O  2  in cancer cells into O  2  . Subsequently, the glucose oxidase (GOx) could deplete intracellular glucose under the assistance of O  2  , which not only achieves starvation therapy, but also regenerates H  2  O  2  to boost the generation of highly cytotoxic &#183;OH due to the peroxidase activity of Cu  2&#8208;x  Se. Moreover, although glutathione (GSH) as a free radical scavenger is overexpressed in tumor cells, the Cu  2&#8208;x  Se with glutathione oxidase activity could effectively consume GSH for enhanced ROS production. Thus, the &#8220;four&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; nanozyme@natural enzyme symbiotic system of Cu  2&#8208;x  Se&#8208;GOx could significantly induce ROS accumulation at the tumor regions, which provides a potential approach for the treatment of cervical cancer.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>High&#8208;valent tetraalkylcuprates(III) and &#8208;argentates(III) are key intermediates of copper and silver&#8208;mediated C&#8722;C coupling reactions. Here, we investigate the previously reported contrasting reactivity of [RM  III  Me  3  ]  &#8722;  complexes (M = Cu, Ag and R = allyl) with energy&#8208;dependent collision&#8208;induced dissociation experiments, advanced quantum&#8208;chemical calculations and kinetic computations. The gas&#8208;phase fragmentation experiments confirmed the preferred formation of the [RCuMe]  &#8722;  anion upon collisional activation of the cuprate(III) species, consistent with a homo&#8208;coupling reaction, whereas the silver analogue primarily yielded [AgMe  2  ]  &#8722;  , consistent with a cross&#8208;coupling reaction. For both complexes, density functional theory calculations identified one mechanism for homo coupling and four different ones for cross coupling. Of these pathways, an unprecedented concerted  outer&#8208;sphere  cross coupling is of particular interest, because it can explain the formation of [AgMe  2  ]  &#8722;  from the argentate(III) species. Remarkably, the different C&#8722;C coupling propensities of the two [RM  III  Me  3  ]  &#8722;  complexes become only apparent when properly accounting for the multi&#8208;configurational character of the wave function for the key transition state of [RAgMe  3  ]  &#8722;  . Backed by the obtained detailed mechanistic insight for the gas&#8208;phase reactions, we propose that the previously observed cross&#8208;coupling reaction of the silver complex in solution proceeds via the  outer&#8208;sphere  mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular N&#8211;H&#8230;F Hydrogen Bonding Interaction in a Series of 4&#8208;Anilino&#8208;5&#8208;Fluoroquinazolines: Experimental and Theoretical Characterization of Electronic and Conformational Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present the 4&#8208;anilino&#8208;6,7&#8208;ethylenedioxy&#8208;5&#8208;fluoroquinazoline scaffold as a novel model system for the characterization of the weak NH  &#8230;  F hydrogen bonding (HB) interaction. In this scaffold, the aniline NH proton is forced into close proximity with the nearby fluorine (  d  H,F  ~2.0 &#197;, &#8736; ~138&#176;), and a through&#8208;space interaction is observed by NMR spectroscopy with couplings (  1h  J  NH,F  ) of 19 &#177; 1 Hz. We used a combination of experimental (NMR and X&#8208;ray crystallography) and theoretical methods (DFT calculations) for the characterization of this weak interaction. In particular, we investigated the effect of conformational rigidity and steric compression on coupling. We used this scaffold for the direct comparison of fluoride (F) with methoxy (OMe) as HB acceptors, and we probed the susceptibility of the NH  &#8230;  F interaction to changes in electron distribution and resonance by preparing a series of molecules with different electron&#8208;donating or &#8208;withdrawing groups in the positions para to the NH and F. Our results support the idea that fluorine can act as a weak HB acceptor, and the HB strength can be modulated via additive and linear electronic substituent effects.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metabolic activation of the human carcinogen 1,3&#8208;butadiene (BD) by cytochrome 450 monooxygenases gives rise to a genotoxic diepoxide, 1,2,3,4&#8208;diepoxybutane (DEB). This reactive electrophile alkylates guanine bases in DNA to produce N7&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3,4&#8208;epoxy&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;dG (N7&#8208;HEB&#8208;dG) adducts. Because of the positive charge at the N7 position of the purine heterocycle, N7&#8208;HEB&#8208;dG adducts are inherently unstable and can undergo spontaneous depurination or base&#8208;catalyzed imidazole ring opening to give  N  6  &#8208;[2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;  erythro  &#8208;pentofuranosyl]&#8208;2,6&#8208;diamino&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4&#8208;oxo&#8208;5&#8208;  N  &#8208;1&#8208;(oxiran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)propan&#8208;1&#8208;ol&#8208;formamidopyrimidine (DEB&#8208;FAPy&#8208;dG) adducts. Here we report the first synthesis and structural characterization of DEB&#8208;FAPy&#8208;dG adducts. Authentic standards of DEB&#8208;FAPy&#8208;dG and its  15  N  3  &#8208;labeled analogue were used for the development of a quantitative nanoLC&#8208;ESI  +  &#8208;HRMS/MS method, allowing for adduct detection in DEB&#8208;treated calf thymus DNA. DEB&#8208;FAPy&#8208;dG formation in DNA was dependent on DEB concentration and pH, with higher numbers observed under alkaline conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Developing efficient small molecule acceptors with sp2&#8208;hybridized nitrogen at different positions by density functional theory calculations, molecular dynamics simulations and machine learning</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical structure of small molecule acceptors determines their performance in organic solar cells. Multiscale simulations are necessary to avoid trial&#8208;and&#8208;error based design, ultimately to save time and resources. Herein, the effect of sp  2  &#8208;hybridized nitrogen substitution at the inner or the outmost position of central core, side chain, and terminal group of small molecule acceptors is investigated using multiscale computational modelling. Quantum chemical analysis is used to study the electronic behavior. Nitrogen substitution at end&#8208;capping has significantly decreased the electron&#8208;reorganization energy. No big change is observed in transfer integral and excited state behavior. However, nitrogen substitution at terminal group position is good way to improve electron&#8208;mobility. Power conversion efficiency (PCE) of newly designed acceptors is predicted using machine learning. Molecular dynamics simulations are also performed to explore the dynamics of acceptor and their blends with PBDB&#8208;T polymer donor. Florgy&#8208;Huggins parameter is calculated to study the mixing of designed small molecule acceptors with PBDB&#8208;T. Radial distribution function has indicated that PBDB&#8208;T has showed a closer packing with N3 and N4. From all analysis, it is found that nitrogen substitution at end&#8208;capping group is a better strategy to design efficient small molecule acceptors.</dc:description>

Treatment of these aryl oxazolines with excess oxalyl chloride (50 &#176;C, 4 h) provided the corresponding nitriles (36 examples, 73&#8208;99% yield).

         <title>Elucidating the Supramolecular Copolymerization of N&#8208; and C&#8208;Centered Benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;Tricarboxamides: The Role of Parallel and Antiparallel Packing of Amide Groups in the copolymer microstructure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An in&#8208;depth study of the supramolecular copolymerization behavior of N&#8208; and C&#8208;centered benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamides (N&#8208; and C&#8208;BTAs) is conducted in methylcyclohexane and in the solid state. The connectivity of the amide groups in the BTAs differs, and mixing N&#8208; and C&#8208;BTAs results in supramolecular copolymers with a blocky microstructure in solution. The blocky microstructure results from the formation of weaker and less organized, antiparallel hydrogen bonds between N&#8208; and C&#8208;BTAs. In methylcyclohexane, the helical threefold hydrogen&#8208;bonding network present in C&#8208; and N&#8208;BTAs is retained in the mixtures. In the solid state, in contrast, the hydrogen bonds of pure BTAs as well as their mixtures organize in a sheet&#8208;like pattern, and in the mixtures long&#8208;range order is lost. Drop&#8208;casting to kinetically trap the solution microstructures shows that C&#8208;BTAs retain the helical hydrogen bonds, but N&#8208;BTAs immediately adopt the sheet&#8208;like pattern, a direct consequence of the lower stabilization energy of the helical hydrogen bonds. In the copolymers, the stability of the helical aggregates depends on the copolymer composition, and helical aggregates are only preserved when a high amount of C&#8208;BTAs is present. The method outlined here is generally applicable to elucidate copolymerization behavior of supramolecular monomers both in solution as well as in the solid state.</dc:description>
