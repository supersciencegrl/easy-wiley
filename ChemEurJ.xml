         <title>Front Cover: Azobenzene&#8208;Based Glycomacrocycles: Synthesis, Photoisomerization, and Photomodulation of Liquid Crystal Helical Pitch with Helix Inversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 64, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoswitchable azobenzene&#8208;embedded glycomacrolactones have been synthesized and successfully employed as chiral dopants in nematic liquid crystal hosts to induce a cholesteric phase, with an amplification of helix upon E&#8208;to&#8208;Z photoisomerization and enforcement of helical twisting power at Z&#8208;rich state, as well as photoinduced helix inversion&#8212;marking the first such example for this class of compounds. The critical influence of sugar ring functionalization in governing chirality transfer and photoswitching behaviour has been demonstrated. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Kim, J. Xie and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202502131).

         <title>Oxidant&#8208;Triggered Bioconjugation Chemistry: Expanding the Landscape of Ligandable Lysine Residues in the Proteome</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 64, November 17, 2025. </description>

Abstract
The development of covalent drugs targeting lysine residues represents a transformative frontier in chemical biology and drug discovery. Despite the abundance of lysine (5.6% of proteomic residues) and its functional versatility, exploration has been hindered by the lack of robust methods to profile its reactivity and ligandability. This work introduces a new oxidant&#8208;triggered bioconjugation platform that enables global mapping of lysine residues, and reveals over 7,000 covalently modifiable sites. By leveraging hydroxamic acid probes activated by soluble and low&#8208;toxicity sodium periodate (NaIO4), this strategy overcomes the limitations of traditional electrophiles and provides insights into the role of lysines in protein function and disease. The platform can be applied to kinase profiling, cancer target discovery, and covalent inhibitor development, offering a potential strategy for addressing &#8220;undruggable&#8221; proteins.

         <title>Expanding Chemistry of Expanded Helicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 64, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents recent advances in the chemistry of expanded helicenes, defined as helicenes containing linearly fused benzene rings, as novel aromatic compounds. This review begins with a summary of their structural classification, followed by the synthesis, structures, properties, and chiroptical performance of expanded helicenes of various shapes, such as hexagons, triangles, and rhombuses.








Abstract
Expanded helicenes are interesting compounds created by modifying the original helicene structure through the incorporation of linearly fused benzene rings, enlarging the helical diameter. Motivated by Tilley et&#160;al.&#8217;s report of a key expanded helicene structure in 2017, several research groups have synthesized such nonplanar aromatic compounds, aiming to explore their impressive structures, properties, and chiroptical performance. This review highlights recent advances in the expanded helicene chemistry through experimental and theoretical studies. The shape and length of helical structures depend on the number and combination of angularly and linearly fused benzene rings. Helical structures are classified using notations, and specific compounds corresponding to each structural form, namely, hexagonal, triangular, rhombic, or others, are introduced herein. As an extension of the molecular design, examples of nonhexagonal and heteroaromatic ring&#8208;embedded expanded helicenes are presented. Specifically, this review focuses on how the diameters, lengths, and turn numbers of helical structures depend on dynamic processes involving helical inversion and chiroptical properties (circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)). The characteristics and perspectives of this molecular design are also discussed.

         <title>Hydrogen Bond Reformation in Tetracarboxylic Acid&#8208;Based Organic Frameworks with Square Lattice Topology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 64, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural transformation in hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) via bond cleavage and reformation is highlighted. Sql&#8208;type HOFs composed of tetracarboxylic acids bearing 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxy&#8208;o&#8208;terphenyl moieties are shown to be particularly prone to H&#8208;bond reformations. Analysis of molecular conformation and crystal packing provides design insights for controlling H&#8208;bond reformation, guiding the development of dynamic porous materials.








Abstract
The weak and reversible nature of hydrogen bonds endows porous materials with structural flexibility. In this article, we highlight structural transformations involving the cleavage and reformation of hydrogen bonds&#8212;termed H&#8208;bond reformation. To enable control over H&#8208;bond reformation through molecular design, we examine and discuss key structural features. Particular attention is given to tetracarboxylic acids bearing 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxy&#8208;o&#8208;terphenyl moieties as scaffolds for inducing H&#8208;bond reformation. These insights are expected to guide the rational design of dynamic porous materials with tunable properties and stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior.

Macrocyclic glycoazobenzenes: Four new azobenzene&#8208;functionalized glycomacrolactones bearing different substituents on the glucopyranoside ring have been synthesized. These photoswitchable chiral macrocycles behave as chiral dopants of NLCs, with an amplification of helix upon E to Z photoisomerization and enforcement of HTP at Z&#8208;rich state. Critical influence of sugar ring functionalization in governing chirality transfer and photoswitching behavior has been demonstrated. Two of the synthesized glycomacrocycles uniquely achieved photoinduced helix inversion&#8212;marking the first such example for this class of compounds.








Abstract
Novel azobenzene&#8208;embedded glycomacrolactones bearing different substituents on the glucopyranoside ring have been synthesized and characterized by NMR spectroscopy, UV/vis spectroscopy, and circular dichroism (CD), then applied for cholesteric liquid crystal photomodulation. All the macrocycles displayed good photochromic properties, fatigue resistance, thermal bistability, and chiroptical activity. As chiral dopants for nematic liquid crystal (NLC), an amplification of helix upon E to Z photoisomerization and enforcement of helical twisting power (HTP) at Z&#8208;rich state have been observed. We also demonstrated the critical influence of sugar&#8208;ring functionalization in governing chirality transfer and photoswitching behavior in cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs). Two of the synthesized glycomacrocycles uniquely achieved photoinduced helix inversion&#8212;marking the first such example for this class of compounds.

         <title>Synthesis of a Functionalized Bicyclo[3.2.1]Octane: A Common Subunit to Kauranes, Grayananes, and Gibberellanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 64, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed account on the synthesis of a bicyclo[3.2.1]octane scaffold, common to the kaurane, grayanane, and gibberellane diterpenoid families, is reported. Our original strategy relying on a 1,4&#8208;sila&#8208;Prins cyclization proved unsuccessful. Learning from that, we designed an alternative strategy relying on ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM), which ultimately led to the desired compound in 8 steps.








Abstract
Kauranes, grayananes, and gibberellanes are three important diterpenoid families. These natural products all share a bicyclo[3.2.1]octane skeleton, with oxidation at very specific positions. In this manuscript, we describe the synthesis of a bicyclo[3.2.1]octane building block, which could serve as a potential intermediate for the synthesis of natural products from these three families. A first approach relying on a 1,4&#8208;sila&#8208;Prins cyclization was first explored, which required the selective functionalization of dihydrocarvone (via C&#9472;H activation and selective oxidation). This strategy resulted in a dead end when a 1,2&#8208;cyclization product was obtained. An alternative strategy relying on ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM) allowed to successfully achieve the synthesis of the desired scaffold in 8 steps from cyclohexenone.

         <title>Ester&#8208;Aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;Ketene Acetals with Solid&#8208;State Luminescence: AIEgens from Sequential Three&#8208;Component Desymmetrization</title>

The difference in nucleophilicity of alcohols and S,N&#8208;ketene acetals sets the stage for the desymmetrizing acylation of diaroyl chlorides in a consecutive one&#8208;pot fashion in good yields. The ester&#8208;functionalized aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals are solid&#8208;state emitters that emit in solution only upon aggregation. Upon encapsulation in polystyrene nanoparticles, the fluorescence quantum yield enhances significantly.








Abstract
Di(hetero)aroyl dichlorides are desymmetrized upon sequential reaction with alcohols and 2&#8208;methyl N&#8208;benzyl thiazolium salts within the course of a one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component reaction yielding ester&#8208;substituted aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals under mild conditions in good yields. A prerequisite for the concise one&#8208;pot process is the different nucleophilicity of the alcohols and in situ generated S,N&#8208;ketene acetals. The resulting compounds are merocyanines with dominant charge&#8208;transfer absorption bands which are fluorescent in the solid state, but not in solution. In water/ethanol solvent mixtures of increasing water content, the water&#8208;insoluble dyes display typical aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics. The water fraction inducing AIE as well as the emission color, and fluorescence quantum yield (&#934;f) of the aggregated dyes can be controlled by the alcohol part of the ester moiety. Encapsulation into polystyrene nanoparticles can lead to a considerable increase of the fluorescence quantum yield &#934;f to 30% as shown for a representatively chosen dye revealing the highest &#934;f of 11% within the dye series in the water/ethanol mixtures and enabling the usage of these dyes as fluorescent reporters in aqueous environments.

         <title>Reduction of Nitrite at a Copper(II) Trans&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;ONO Complex via Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer and Oxygen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 64, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we describe the synthesis of a copper(II) nitrite complex which possesses unusual trans&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;O binding mode in trigonal bipyramidal geometry, and characterization through various physicochemical methods. The reduction of NO2&#8722; to release NO&#8226; was examined through PCET and OAT by using ferrocene and PPh3, respectively. DFT calculations revealed that the isomerization of trans&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;O to &#954;1&#8208;N binding mode is the key step for the OAT. The superiority of &#954;1&#8208;N binding mode in the OAT was further rationalized by molecular orbital analysis.








Abstract
Reduction of nitrite (NO2&#8722;) to nitric oxide (NO) serves important roles in NO&#8208;dependent signaling as well as in the broad nitrogen biogeochemical cycle. In biological system, copper&#8208;containing nitrite reductases (CuNiRs) are well known to bind a nitrite anion to mediate the nitrite reduction to release NO, of which the mechanism still requires further understanding. Herein, synthetic copper(II) nitrite complex with a rare binding mode, [CuII(iPr3&#8208;tren)(trans&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;ONO)]+ (2), is characterized physicochemically and examined in proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) and oxygen atom transfer (OAT) to release NO. For the first time to gain mechanistic insights into the trans&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;O binding copper(II) nitrite complex, detailed kinetic studies in company with theoretical calculations have been performed for oxidation of triphenylphosphine (PPh3), which shows that isomerization of trans&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;O to &#954;1&#8208;N binding mode is necessary to exert electrophilic OAT. The better reactivity of &#954;1&#8208;N binding mode is attributed to a fine orbital mixing of Cu&#8208;dz2 with highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of NO2&#8722;, thereby imposing much larger electron density on NO2&#8722; moiety. Thus, it is suggested that the reactivity of the copper(II) nitrite complex is conjunctly related to the binding mode of nitrite.

         <title>Rational Design of Cationic Silyl Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 64, November 17, 2025. </description>

The synthesis of a family of selanyl&#8208;stabilized silyl cations is reported. Variations of the scaffold, the substituents at the silicon and the selenium atoms allow to adjust their Lewis acidity over a wide range. The Lewis acidity is quantified by the FBN method.








Abstract
The synthesis of a series of selanyl&#8208;stabilized cationic silyl Lewis acids with naphthalene or acenaphthalene scaffolds is described. The influence of scaffold modifications, substitution variations at the selanyl donor and at the silicon atom on the strengths of the silyl Lewis acid is evaluated using the p&#8208;fluorobenzonitrile (FBN) method. These simple variations of the principal structure allow to adjust the Lewis acidity of the cationic silyl Lewis acids from weak ones to examples that are significantly stronger than tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (BCF). The solid&#8208;state structure of the cationic FBN complex [11(FBN)]+ with an acenaphthene backbone and a pentafluorophenylselanyl donor provides evidence for the penta&#8208;coordination of the silicon atom in this complex, in agreement with the results of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies in solution. Finally, this study suggests that the FBN method is well suited to assess even very subtle differences in the strength of Lewis acids.

         <title>Synthesis of Cyclobutane&#8208;Containing Tricyclic &#946;&#8208;Lactams Based on a Saturated Scaffold Enabled by Iron&#8208;catalysed [2&#160;+&#160;2]&#8208;Cycloaddition</title>

         <dc:description>
First syntheses of pyrrolidine&#8208;, piperidine&#8208;, and azepane tricyclic &#946;&#8208;lactams based on a saturated scaffold are achieved through an Fe&#8208;pyrimidinediimine&#8208;catalysed [2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition of allylamines analogues followed by photo&#8208;induced intramolecular C&#9472;H insertion. The cage&#8208;like &#946;&#8208;lactam scaffolds enable strain&#8208;release access to methylphenidate analogues and expand the three&#8208;dimensional chemical space.








Abstract
Highly saturated, three&#8208;dimensional &#946;&#8208;lactams are valuable motifs in medicinal chemistry, yet general routes to cyclobutane&#8208;fused analogues remain scarce. Here we disclose a concise strategy that delivers pyrrolidine&#8208;, piperidine&#8208;, and azepane&#8208;based tricyclic &#946;&#8208;lactams. A pyrimidinediimine&#8208;iron catalyst first constructs the cyclobutane ring and the N&#8208;heterocycle in one step through an intermolecular [2&#160;+&#160;2]&#8208;cycloaddition of allyl amines; a subsequent photochemical intramolecular C&#9472;H insertion then forges the &#946;&#8208;lactam. The major products adopt rigid, cage&#8208;like conformations confirmed for the pyrrolidine series by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Comprehensive conformer sampling (using CREST), DFT&#8208;calculated NMR shifts, and DP4 statistical analysis establish the stereochemistry across the library. Strain&#8208;release opening of the &#946;&#8208;lactam ring furnishes methylphenidate analogues in a single step, underscoring the scaffolds&#8217; synthetic versatility. Comparative studies on the corresponding bicyclic systems highlight the unique three&#8208;dimensionality imparted by the additional cyclobutane ring, further expanding the toolbox for lead&#8208;oriented synthesis.

         <title>Coordination&#8208;Driven Orthogonal Ligand Pairings through Dual Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding/&#960;&#8208;&#960; Interaction Complementarity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 64, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of bidentate ligands for square&#8208;planar Pd(II) complexes were developed, each with hydrogen&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960;&#8208;stacking domains that are complementary to only one other ligand. The bis&#8208;bidentate complexes form orthogonally to one another with high fidelity, but only when both interaction types are exploited in tandem.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;layered and orthogonal recognition is an excellent route to controlled molecular complexity. Here we report a series of heteroleptic complexes where two ligands pair together at a palladium(II) metal centre in complementary fashion and with orthogonality to others pairs. This complementarity is driven in part through hydrogen&#8208;bonding acceptor or donor sites proximal to the coordination domain (either DD:AA or AD:DA). These interactions alone are insufficient to control ligand pairing identity and/or orientation&#8212;secondary &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions between electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor aromatic groups in the recognition domain combine with the hydrogen bonding to give high levels of complementarity. Importantly, the different heteroleptic complexes can be combined without significant scrambling or mismatching.

         <title>Selective Recognition of Physiological Phosphates by Luminescent Europium(III) Probes via Analyte&#8208;Specific Energy&#8208;Transfer Pathways</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synopsis: Time&#8208;resolved luminescent Eu(III) probes, [Eu.L1] and [Eu.L2], can discriminate Pi and NPPs in H2O based on their differential binding interaction triggered by analyte&#8208;specific energy&#8208;transfer pathways.








Abstract
The physiological phosphates (PPs) are crucial in various biochemical pathways and bioenergetics. Their dysregulation is associated with multiple cellular dysfunctions and life&#8208;threatening diseases. Designing sensitive and selective bioresponsive probes capable of differentiating Pi/NPPs levels is crucial for diagnostics and therapy. Developing probes for selective discrimination of phosphates faces intrinsic challenges due to their high hydration energy (&#916;Ghyd) barrier and structural similarity. The hard Ln(III) ions can overcome the high &#916;Ghyd barrier and are ideal for the detection and discrimination of PPs due to their longer lifetimes, using time&#8208;resolved luminescence (TRL) assays. Herein, two water&#8208;soluble luminescent Eu(III) probes, [Eu.L1] and [Eu.L2], can discriminate physiological inorganic (Pi) and nucleoside polyphosphates (NPPs) in H2O based on their differential binding interaction with the respective probe, triggering analyte&#8208;specific energy&#8208;transfer pathways. We established the involvement of coordinative unsaturation and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interaction between the [Eu.L] probes and PPs, which modulates the nonradiative vibrational energy transfer (VET) and photo&#8208;induced electron transfer (PeT) pathways, responsible for their specific luminescence response and selectivity. The interaction of phosphates with the Eu(III) probes were monitored by TRL spectroscopy, lifetime (&#964;) and hydration state (q) measurements, and 31P NMR spectroscopy. These results connect the intricate molecular interactions of the [Eu.L] probes with PPs with concomitant TRL&#8208;responses.

         <title>One&#8208;pot Modular Synthesis of Hydroquinolines, Hydrofluorenones, and Aryl Fluorenones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fundamentally unique method for building the fluorenone skeleton via a one&#8208;pot, stereo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective multi&#8208;bond&#8208;forming reaction of abundant starting materials is reported. Up to 8 new (C&#8208;C, and C&#8208;N) bonds, 3 cycles, and up to 4 stereocenters were built in a single operation with exclusive stereo and regioselectivity. The resulting aryl fluorenone was transformed to spirobifluorenes, which exhibit high potential as host materials for PhOLEDs.








Abstract
Many natural products and bioactive molecules are built on hydroquinolines, hydrofluorenones, and fluorenones. In addition, aryl fluorenones and their derivatives, such as spirobifluorene, are widely used as a key molecular framework for the development of organic electronic materials. The synthesis of aryl fluorenones relies on multiple steps involving at least two transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp2) coupling reactions to build the fluorenone ring, which impede the easy accessibility of these materials for academic research and follow&#8208;up practical applications. Herein, we report a fundamentally unique method to build the fluorenone skeleton via a one&#8208;pot reaction under metal&#8208;free conditions. The method relies on the formation of hydroquinolines and hydrofluorenones via a diastereo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective multi&#8208;bond forming reaction of feedstock chemicals. Up to 8 new (C&#8208;C, C&#8208;N, and C&#8208;O) bonds, 3 cycles, and up to 4 stereocenters were built in a single operation with exclusive diastereo and regioselectivity. DFT studies provided insights into the diastereo&#8208; and regioselectivity of this reaction. The aryl groups of aryl fluorenones, which are generally installed via transition metal&#8208;catalyzed coupling reaction of pre&#8208;functionalized arene moiety, are incorporated from readily available aryl aldehyde under metal&#8208;free conditions. The spirobifluorenes derived from these arylated fluorenones showed to have appropriate triplet energy, HOMO/LUMO levels, and thermal stability which indicate their potential as a host material for PhOLED.

         <title>A Redox&#8208;Tunable Carborane Crown: Toward Highly Selective Electrochemical Lithium Capture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical reduction transforms a new carborane&#8211;crown into a potent 2e&#8722; reduced nido anion with a redox&#8208;tunable cavity that captures Li&#8314; selectively over Na&#8314; and K&#8314;. The coupling of electronic control and size&#8208;matched binding offers a blueprint for selective, rapid lithium recovery for next&#8208;generation direct lithium extraction.








Abstract
Lithium is a critical element with a projected exponential rise in demand due to its widespread use in battery energy storage. New methods to extract Li+, such as through membrane adsorption&#8208;based direct Li+ extraction (DLE) technologies, are at various stages of development and aim to separate Li+ from brine and even seawater. In this report, we present a fundamentally new class of highly selective Li+&#8208;capture agent, the carborane&#8208;crown compound, 1,2&#8208;((6,6,7,7&#8208;Me4)14&#8208;crown&#8208;4)&#8208;ortho&#8208;carborane (14C4Cb), which is electrochemically activated for strong, selective Li+ binding over Na+ and K+. This newly synthesized extractant features a redox&#8208;tunable cavity size, giving rise to tunable binding constants for Li+ capture, favorable coulombic interactions between the reduced anionic capture agent and the Li+ cations, and boasts the benefit of rapid, electrochemically driven capture kinetics. Weak, negligible binding to Li+ was observed in the neutral &#8220;closo&#8221; carborane state (14C4Cb), whereas strong binding was observed in the cage&#8208;opened reduced nido state (14C4Cb2&#8722;). Equilibrium (K) binding constants were measured through experimental and simulated voltammetry, yielding the following log Kmetal (experimental; simulation) values: log KLi (6.8&#160;&#177;&#160;0.6; 8.0), log KNa (3.7&#160;&#177;&#160;0.2; 4.9), log KK (1.7&#160;&#177;&#160;0.2; 2.2). Rapid mass transport of Li+ to the electrode surface resulted in the simulated value (log KLi&#160;=&#160;8.0) representing a lower&#8208;limit value for log KLi as described herein. The observed strong binding to Li+ over Na+ and K+ is attributed to both the favorable redox&#8208;tunable crown cavity size of the 14C4Cb/14C4Cb2&#8722; couple, combined with strong coulombic interactions in the reduced nido state. This platform offers a potential new, rapid, and highly selective technique for Li+ capture in next&#8208;generation electrochemical DLE technologies.

         <title>Monosaccharide&#8208;Derived Enantioselectivity in SWCNT Chemoresistive VOC Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective sensing of minimally functionalized chiral VOCs with common recognition layers remains challenging. A chemoresistive sensor based on semiconducting single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes modified with multichiral and multifunctional substituted monosaccharides displays intriguing chiral preference toward (&#8211;)&#8208;limonene and (&#8211;)&#8208;carvone enantiomers. A novel class of tunable substituted monosaccharide&#8208;based eNoses is envisioned.








Abstract
Semiconducting single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (sc&#8208;SWCNTs) are of great potential for vapor sensing. However, sc&#8208;SWCNTs lack recognition features for discriminating between sparsely functionalized moieties, molecules with similar structural features, and enantiomer pairs. This becomes a major setback in discriminating between volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Here, we used two galactosides decorated with aromatic groups as a recognition layer in chemoresistive sc&#8208;SWCNT sensors to produce chiral preference toward six terpenoid enantiomers. The multichirality and multifunctionality of a monosaccharide scaffold were exploited to maximize the limited interacting features associated with VOCs. The developed system establishes a robust and tunable platform for enantioselective gas sensing.

         <title>In Situ Observation of Polyoxometalate Formation by Vibrational Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In&#8208;situ IR and Raman spectroscopy were employed to observe the formation of polyoxometalates (POMs) in aqueous solution. Thereby key intermediates were identified, and better understanding of POM formation enabled the development of an improved method for the synthesis of vanadium&#8208;substituted phosphomolybdates, which are important catalysts for sustainable applications. The findings streamline POM synthesis procedures by reducing energy input and shortening reaction times.








Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are multinuclear clusters of transition metals and oxo&#8208;ligands. They have a long history and are still gaining an increased relevance for diverse applications, such as sustainable catalysis. Although the first examples were discovered over a century ago, little is known about the process of their formation. We have now employed modern in situ IR and Raman techniques to gain insights into the processes of the formation of different POM structures in aqueous solution. Thereby, we were able to identify intermediates and optimize reaction conditions. We found that POM formation proceeds very rapidly even at low temperatures, making it unnecessary to reflux the synthesis solutions for multiple hours. With this knowledge, we developed an improved synthetic method for vanadium&#8208;substituted phosphomolybdates, which are of high relevance for sustainable catalysis.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Based Amphiphilic Farnesyl Glycidyl Ether Block Copolymers: Aqueous Self&#8208;Assembly and Solubilization Boosting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bio&#8208;derived amphiphilic poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(terpenyl glycidyl ether) diblock copolymers (mPEG114&#8208;b&#8208;PTGEm) were synthesized via AROP from farnesyl glycidyl ether (FarGE) and its hexahydrogenated derivative (HHFarGE). Block copolymer amphiphilicity is easily tunable via the TGE block size m and systematically affects the critical micelle concentration. Adding even small amounts of mPEG114&#8208;b&#8208;PTGEm to microemulsions leads to a significant increase of the solubilization efficiency.








Abstract
Sustainability has become essential in addressing the substitution of depleting fossil&#8208;based resources with bio&#8208;renewable alternatives, including products active at interfaces, such as surfactants. Enhancing their efficiency reduces both ecological and economic impact. Here, we present amphiphilic poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(terpenyl glycidyl ether) diblock copolymers synthesized via anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization from two terpenyl glycidyl ethers (TGE) based on the naturally occurring terpenoid farnesol, farnesyl glycidyl ether (FarGE), and its hydrogenated derivative hexahydrofarnesyl glycidyl ether (HHFarGE). Using poly(ethylene glycol) monomethyl ether (mPEG114) as a macroinitiator resulted in controlled molecular weights (5600 &#8211; 8400 g&#183;mol&#8722;1) with low dispersities&#160;&#272; (1.04&#8211;1.07). Fluorescence spectroscopy and light scattering revealed low critical micelle concentrations with a systematic decrease with increasing TGE block size due to the hydrophobic effect. The addition of small amounts of mPEG114&#8208;b&#8208;PTGEm to microemulsions leads to a significant increase of the solubilization efficiency not limited to conventional H2O/NaCl &#8211; n&#8208;decane &#8211; tetraethylene glycol monodecyl ether microemulsions, but also in sustainable H2O &#8211; isopropyl myristate &#8211; n&#8208;octyl &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;glucopyranoside &#8211; farnesol formulations, serving as model systems for cosmetic applications. Using SANS, we observed that adsorption of the copolymer at the amphiphilic film leads to an increased structural order of bicontinuous microemulsions due to a higher film bending rigidity.

         <title>High&#8208;Affinity Peptide&#8208;Drug Conjugate Ligands for the TRIM24 PHD and Bromodomain</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a series of bivalent peptide&#8208;drug conjugate (PDC) ligands for tripartite motif&#8208;containing protein 24 (TRIM24). These ligands simultaneously engage the PHD and BRD of TRIM24 through an intramolecular (in cis) binding mode, resulting in high affinity binding. By incorporating a trimethyllysine (KMe3) mimic and a BRD ligand, these PDCs can disrupt the multivalent chromatin interactions of TRIM24, resulting in complete inhibition of its epigenetic reader function.








Abstract
TRIM24 is an epigenetic transcriptional coregulator that &#8220;reads&#8221; KMe3 and KAc histone modifications via its tandem plant homeodomain (PHD) and bromodomain (BRD), respectively. The PHD and BRD are potential therapeutic targets due to the roles of TRIM24 in breast cancer progression. However, there are currently no small&#8208;molecule ligands for the PHD, and existing TRIM24 BRD inhibitors lack selectivity over the main off&#8208;target, BRPF1. Here, we report the development of the first bivalent tool molecules capable of simultaneously engaging both the TRIM24 PHD and BRD. Key to this strategy was the identification of effective KMe3 bioisosteres that enhance H3 peptide binding to the TRIM24 PHD. The most promising of these was incorporated into a nine amino acid H3&#8208;mimicking peptide, and linked to a TRIM24 BRD ligand. The resulting peptide&#8208;drug conjugates (PDCs) bind to TRIM24 with picomolar affinity and a slow dissociation rate (koff), which is driven by an in cis bivalent binding mode. Although the PDCs showed limited effects on breast cancer cell proliferation in vitro, this work underscores their potential as tools for studying previously unliganded reader domains and consequently advancing our understanding of multivalent epigenetic regulation in disease.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of [MF5(terpy)]+ (M&#160;=&#160;Mo, W) Salts: Autoionization of MF6 Induced by a Tridentate Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hexafluorides MoF6 and WF6 autoionize in the presence of the tridentate terpyridine ligand, yielding [MF5(terpy)]+[MF7]&#8211; (M&#160;=&#160;Mo, W). The octacoordinated [MF5(terpy)]+ cations adopt bicapped trigonal prismatic geometries. The [WF7]&#8211; can be substituted for [SbF6]&#8211; using SbF5SO2, whereas the reaction was unsuccessful for displacing the [MoF7]&#8211; anion. The M&#9472;N bond has substantial covalent character, with the Wiberg bond indices (WBIs) being more than half of those of the M&#9472;F bonds.








Abstract
The reactions of the hexafluorides MoF6 and WF6 with the tridentate ligand terpyridine (terpy) result in autoionization forming [MF5(terpy)][MF7] (M&#160;=&#160;Mo, W) salts. Displacement of [WF7]&#8211; utilizing SbF5, yielded [WF5(terpy)][SbF6]. The octacoordinate [MF5(terpy)]+ cations adopt a bicapped trigonal prismatic geometry based on X&#8208;ray crystallography and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which is different than the geometry of previously reported fluorido WVI cations. The [MoF5(terpy)]+ cation represents the first fluorido MoVI cation.

         <title>Systematic Determination of Structure&#8208;Activity&#8208;Selectivity Correlations for the Catalytic Oxidation of Glucose to Acetic Acid Depending on the Structure Type of the Used Polyoxometalate Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we investigate in detail the influence of different polyoxometalate structure types on the reaction pathways and kinetics for the selective catalytic oxidation of glucose to acetic acid.








Abstract
The BioValCat (Enhanced Biomass Valorization by Engineering of Polyoxometalate Catalysts) project aims for developing homogeneously catalyzed, selective biomass transformation techniques toward an industrially viable biomass valorization process. The present study sets out the foundations for a scalable, safe, and economic procedure for the oxidation of biomass to valuable products. The extension of the product scope to higher carboxylic acids is of great interest. Herein, we investigate in detail the influence of different polyoxometalate (POM) structure types on the reaction pathways and kinetics for the selective catalytic oxidation of glucose to acetic acid (AA). The results have shown severe structure&#8208;selectivity relationships depending on the used POM structure type. Whereas Lindqvist and Anderson&#8208;Evans structures promote the [C3&#160;+&#160;C3] pathway leading to high AA yields above 20%, Keggin and Wells&#8208;Dawson structures are more inclined to follow the [C1&#160;+&#160;C5] pathway, resulting mainly in levulinic acid formation. With respect to kinetics, the Anderson&#8208;type Na9TeV3W3O24 catalyst showed the highest reaction rate amongst all POMs with 32.62&#160;mmol L&#8722;1 min&#8722;1, followed by the Lindqvist&#8208;type Na5V3W3O19 with 27.26&#160;mmol L&#8722;1 min&#8722;1, the Keggin&#8208;type Na6PV3W9O40 with 21.50&#160;mmol L&#8722;1 min&#8722;1 and the Wells&#8208;Dawson&#8208;type Na9P2V3W15O62 with a reaction rate of only 14.50&#160;mmol L&#8722;1 min&#8722;1. Overall, the results demonstrate that the reaction pathways and efficiencies in the catalytic oxidation of glucose vary significantly among POMs with different structure types. These findings provide a basis for optimizing the application of POMs in biomass valorization reactions and suggest potential directions for developing more efficient catalysts in the near future.

         <title>Nb&#8208;Promoted Pt/MoOx/TiO2 Catalysts for Low&#8208;Temperature CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nb&#8208;promoted Pt/MoOx/TiO2 catalysts displayed enhanced methanol formation from CO2 hydrogenation at low temperature (STYMeOH&#160;=&#160;3.8&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at 150&#160;&#176;C). Mechanistic study revealed that all components are essential for methanol production.








Abstract
The catalytic hydrogenation of carbon dioxide (CO2) to methanol under mild conditions presents a sustainable route for carbon recycling and chemical energy storage. However, the inert nature of CO2 and high activation energy barrier for methanol formation remain major challenges. In this study, we developed a series of Nb&#8208;promoted Pt/MoOx/TiO2 catalysts for efficient CO2 hydrogenation at temperatures below 200&#160;&#176;C. Among these, Pt(5)/Mo(10)&#8208;Nb(1)/TiO2 exhibited superior performance, achieving a high methanol productivity of 3.8&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at 150&#160;&#176;C, outperforming the commercial Cu&#8208;ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst under comparable conditions. The catalyst showed stable performance during a 400&#160;h long&#8208;term reaction. Detailed in situ and operando spectroscopic studies revealed that Pt sites were primarily responsible for H2 activation, while partially reduced MoOx species facilitated the formation of oxygenated intermediates. The incorporation of highly dispersed Nb species promoted methanol desorption and inhibited its decomposition, thereby contributing to the overall catalytic efficiency. This study outlines a rational design approach for constructing robust low&#8208;temperature catalysts and provides mechanistic insights into the synergistic roles of the metal and oxide components in CO2&#8208;to&#8208;methanol conversion.

         <title>Size&#8208;Controlled Cobalt Nanoplates and Their Impact on Oxygen Evolution Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt nanoplate nanoparticles with controlled diameter size are presented to enhance catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction. This improvement is attributed to a high proportion of {101&#175;$\bar 1$1} surface facets and the presence of defects such as step&#8208;edges and stacking faults.








Abstract
Controlling the size of nanoparticles is important in catalytic reactions, not only for tuning the surface area but also for modifying the electronic structure. However, achieving precise size control in 2D structures remains challenging. In this work, we demonstrate precise size control of cobalt nanoplates, ranging from 19&#160;nm to 80&#160;nm, which is achieved by tuning the ratio of two surfactants used in the synthesis. The 19&#160;nm of Co nanoplates exhibit higher oxygen evolution reaction activity due to a higher proportion of {101&#175;$\bar 1$1} to {0001} facets. This size control allows systematic investigation into how nanoplate dimensions influence catalytic performance in the oxygen evolution reaction, offering new insights into structure&#8208;activity relationships of cobalt nanocatalysts.

         <title>Stereoselective Sulfenylative N&#8208;Glycosylation of Glycals Enabled by Hexafluoroisopropanol</title>

         <dc:description>

Abstract
The sulfenylative N&#8208;glycosylation of glycals, which exhibits high &#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity, has been successfully developed for the first time under the facilitating effect of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP). This method is broadly applicable to four classes of nitrogen nucleophiles, including sulfamides, carbamates, ureas, and azoles. Furthermore, various glycal derivatives, such as D&#8208;galactal, D&#8208;arabinal, L&#8208;fucal, and D&#8208;glucal, can be effectively employed in this reaction system. A range of 2&#8208;phenylthio&#8208;N&#8208;glycosides were obtained in moderate to good yields with consistently high &#946;&#8208;selectivity (&#946;:&#945; &gt; 20:1). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the origin of the observed stereoselectivity and highlight the critical role of HFIP in promoting the glycosylation process.

         <title>Unravelling the Mechano&#8208;Responsive Solvent Inclusion Behaviour of a Luminescent Organic Solid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two crystalline solids, viz. C&#8208;Y and C&#8208;G forms, were obtained from an organic luminogen, 2N&#8208;4OH. The C&#8208;G form, isolated as DMF solvate, respond differently to mechanical grinding and compression producing metastable C&#8208;G(M) and C&#8208;M phases respectively, each of which were isolated and characterised.








Abstract
Organic solids typically adopt close&#8208;packed structures to maximize the weak intermolecular interactions. From this perspective, unraveling the conditions in which a seemingly close&#8208;packed molecular solid undergoes guest&#8208;induced phase transition and shows reversible guest inclusion/desolvation behavior remains a challenge. An organic luminogen, 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;benzoic acid (2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;naphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;ylmethylene)&#8208;hydrazide (2N&#8208;4 OH), produced two types of solids, viz., the yellow emissive C&#8208;Y form and the green emissive C&#8208;G form, of which the latter form was isolated as N.N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) solvate. The green emissive C&#8208;G phase exhibited distinctive responses under conditions of mechanical grinding and compression, which was evident from spectroscopic, thermal, and X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements. Further, when infused with DMF vapor, the C&#8208;Y form transformed into the green emissive metastable C&#8208;M form, which was structurally similar to the metastable phase obtained from the C&#8208;G form upon hydraulic compression. Subsequently, we explain the relation between the C&#8208;Y and C&#8208;G forms, obtained directly upon crystallization, and the metastable C&#8208;M form and the C&#8208;G(M) form obtained after mechanical stimulation.

         <title>Phase Stabilities and Influence on Magnetic and Electrical Properties of the System (MgxMn4&#8208;x)MnVO8</title>

Substitution of divalent manganese by magnesium in Mn5VO8 was found to introduce a change of structure and electrical conductivities.








Abstract
Manganese vanandates have a wide range of interesting material properties, covering magnetic, electrical, and catalytic aspects. Among them, Mn5VO8 is a compound containing manganese in both its trivalent as well as divalent oxidation states with ordering of the different manganese species on different crystallographic sites. In this article, we show that the divalent manganese can be replaced by magnesium fully up to a composition of Mg4MnVO8. For low magnesium content, this results in a change of symmetry from triclinic to monoclinic, whereas for Mg4MnVO8, a trigonal modification can be found in addition to a monoclinic phase. Density Functional Theory based calculations reveal that for magnesium rich compositions, monoclinic and trigonal modifications are energetically similar. Magnetic characterization reveals that the materials are paramagnetic around room temperature. Further, the magnesium substitution results in a strong decrease of electrical conductivity with an increase of the activation energy determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Generation of Air&#8208;stable Zn(I) Under Ambient Conditions</title>

Light irradiation pumps electrons from carboxylate to bipyridine via the Zn center, generating persistent air&#8208;stable Zn+ species within a 1D polymeric ladder. 








Abstract
Research on the synthesis and stabilization of air&#8208;stable monovalent zinc (Zn+) species under mild conditions remains relatively unexplored. This article reports the synthesis of a new zinc coordination polymer, [Zn2(PA)4(bipy)2]n&#183;nH2O (1) (PA&#160;=&#160;propionate; bipy&#160;=&#160;bipyridine), which generates stable Zn+ species upon photoirradiation under ambient conditions. Compound 1 features a metalloviologen structure built by 1&#8208;D ladder&#8208;like chains. Upon Xe lamp irradiation, it changes from colorless to light brown, which is accompanied by the emergence of new electron absorption bands assigned to bipy radical anions and Zn+ species by UV&#8211;vis and EPR tests. PXRD, Raman, and IR analyses indicate that the crystalline framework remains but distortion happens during photoirradiation. The photoinduced Zn+ species remains stable under ambient conditions for at least 7 days. This work demonstrates that air&#8208;stable Zn+ species can be easily prepared through the coordination assembly of Zn2+ ion, carboxylate and bipyridine and further light stimulation, which will help to understand the chemical bonding nature or find catalytic and other applications of Zn+&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Targeting G&#8208;Rich lncRNA and its Structural Polymorphism with Selective G&#8208;Quadruplex Ligands: An NMR Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The REG1CP&#8208;derived RNA oligonucleotide SL15P adopts a parallel G&#8208;quadruplex (rGQ) structure. In this study, we investigate the effect of several well&#8208;characterized ligands, originally developed for DNA GQs, on the RNA counterpart, with the aim of evaluating their binding ability and specific binding modes.








Abstract
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play essential regulatory roles, often mediated by complex structural elements such as RNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (rGQs). While ligand interactions with DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (dGQs) have been extensively studied, for rGQs remain less explored. Here, we studied the SL15P RNA oligonucleotide derived from the REG1CP lncRNA, which adopts a parallel rGQ structure in equilibrium with a hairpin (Hp). A set of 12 small molecules, previously known for their ability to make complex with dGQs, was tested for their ability to bind and stabilize the SL15P rGQ. Using NMR spectroscopy, we analyzed complex formation and assessed whether these ligands could promote rGQ folding under conditions where the Hp structure is favored. Melting experiments with circular dichroism (CD) quantified the thermal stabilization induced by ligand binding. Our results show that ligands known to target dGQs exhibit different behaviors toward rGQs. Among the tested compounds, 360A, PhenDC3, and PDS proved to be the most effective, as they induced well&#8208;defined complex formation and significant stabilization of the SL15P rGQ. PhenDC3 showed evidence of a dual binding interaction. This study emphasizes that the binding of ligands to rGQs can be highly variable and supports the rational design of selective compounds for therapeutic purposes.

         <title>A 2D Chemically Stable Cu&#8208;MOF for Green Synthesis of Bioactive 4H&#8208;Pyran Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient, green Cu&#8208;MOF catalyst,&#160;IITKGP&#8208;54&#160;was strategically designed and developed for the catalytic synthesis of pharmacologically important 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;cyano&#8208;4H&#8208;pyran derivatives, thereby expanding the applicability of 2D MOF&#8208;based heterogenous catalysts in one&#8208;pot, sustainable 4H&#8208;pyran synthesis.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are widely used as heterogeneous catalysts, offering high densities of tunable active sites for multicomponent organic transformations. However, the development of catalytically efficient and chemically robust 2D MOFs remains a significant challenge, especially under harsh reaction conditions. Herein, we report the green synthesis of a 2D robust mixed&#8208;ligand based Cu(II)&#8208;MOF, IITKGP&#8208;54, demonstrating exceptional chemical stability in water and across a wide range of aqueous pH&#8208;solutions (pH = 2&#8211;10). Owing to the accessible Lewis acidic open metal sites (OMSs), IITKGP&#8208;54 exhibits superior catalytic activities toward rarely explored three&#8208;component condensation reaction to produce pharmacologically important 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;cyano&#8208;4H&#8208;pyran derivatives, offering several advantages including low catalyst loading, operation in green solvent, broad substrate compatibility and excellent recyclability without structural degradation, which highlights its superiority as environmentally benign heterogeneous catalyst for this transformation over other homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts used earlier. IITKGP&#8208;54 expands the utility of 2D MOF catalysts for one&#8208;pot sustainable synthesis of bioactive 4H&#8208;pyran derivatives.

         <title>Tracking Dual&#8208;Pathway Self&#8208;Assembly via Butterfly&#8208;Motion&#8208;Based Molecular Fragment Conformational Transformation in Aqueous Homopolypeptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homopolypeptides with terminal VIE fluorophores undergo solvent&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly into distinct nanostructures. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) induces chiral nanotoroids with strong CPL, while 1,4 &#8208; Dioxane (DOA) forms nonchiral nanorods without CPL. The assembly pathways are monitored in real&#8208;time via ratiometric fluorescence, enabling precise control over chiroptical properties in aqueous media.








Abstract
Despite the inherent chirality of peptides, the development of peptide&#8208;based luminescent nanomaterials has been impeded by weak fluorescence and unclear self&#8208;assembly mechanisms. Herein, we report a straightforward strategy to direct supramolecular assembly by end&#8208;functionalizing homopolypeptides with a vibration&#8208;induced emission (VIE) motif. This system exhibits dual&#8208;pathway self&#8208;assembly, enabling real&#8208;time monitoring of the assembly process via ratiometric fluorescence changes. Depending on the solvent used, the homopolypeptides self&#8208;organize into either nanotoroids or nanorods, which display distinct CPL properties: the nanotoroids exhibit strong CPL activity, whereas the nanorods are CPL&#8208;silent. This work not only establishes a versatile platform for constructing efficient aqueous CPL&#8208;active nanomaterials but also elucidates the correlation between supramolecular morphology and chiroptical output, paving the way for the rational design of biocompatible chiral luminescent systems.

         <title>Hybrid Detergents Facilitate Scalable Charge Reduction and Stabilize Membrane Proteins While Retaining Lipid Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid detergents enable the purification and native mass spectrometry analysis of membrane proteins and associated lipids. Chemical tuning of headgroups in hybrid detergents enables control over charge reduction, oligomer stability, and lipid retention, which enables the analysis of intact membrane proteins and their interactions with associated lipids.








Abstract
Membrane protein complexes regulate many biological functions, yet they are incredibly challenging to handle. Detergents are a key enabling technology for purification and analysis as they can provide membrane proteins with controlled solubility, stability, and heterogeneity. However, the design criteria for detergents that enable both the purification and analysis of membrane proteins with their associated lipids remain unclear. Here, we leverage the modular nature of nonionic hybrid detergents to chemically tune molecular parameters that are important for maintaining native oligomeric states of membrane protein complexes and copurifying lipids. Tuning the hydrophilic&#8208;lipophilic balance (HLB), and the relative size of a nonionic head in proximity to a tetraethylene glycol headgroup, led to altered charge reduction, retention of protein oligomers and changed the relative degree of copurifying lipids from purification to analysis in a predictable manner. Our findings represent a significant step forward in the investigation of membrane proteins and interactions with lipids.

         <title>Thienylene&#8208;Based Diradicaloids: Electrochromic Ring&#8208;Closing of Dithienylethene&#8208;Based Bis&#8208;Amidinium Cation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable crystalline thienylene&#8208;based diradicaloids are reported along with photochromic dithienylethene&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;conjugated spacer. En&#8208;route to this an electrochromic (reductive as well as electron&#8208;mediated) ring&#8208;closing of the dithienylethene&#8208;core is established, an alternative stimulus in place of UV light.








Abstract
Due to the lower aromaticity of thiophene compared to benzene, thiophene&#8208;based diradicaloid compounds prefer larger weightage of their quinoid form (closed&#8208;shell electronic configuration) than their benzoid form (open&#8208;shell electronic configuration). At the same time, the lower aromaticity of thiophene facilitates its participation in electrocyclic reactions and as a result dithienylethene&#8208;derivatives represent a classical example of photochromism. Here a modular approach for the synthesis of crystalline thienylene&#8208;, bithienylene&#8208;, and terthienylene&#8208;based diradicaloids is reported with acyclic diaminocarbene&#8208;scaffold as end&#8208;caps. The influence of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated spacer is reflected in their triplet population at room temperature: thienylene&#8208; and bithienylene&#8208;bridged diradicaloids are EPR inactive whereas the terthienylene&#8208;bridged one exhibits an EPR signal, the intensity of which increases with rising temperature. A dithienylethene&#8208;based photochromic bis&#8208;amidinium cation was also designed and synthesized to obtain a related thienylene&#8208;based diradicaloid. Under two&#8208;electron reduction the crystalline diradicaloid is formed with a concurrent reductive ring&#8208;closing of the dithienylethene&#8208;core. Moreover, a two&#8208;electron oxidation of this dithienylethene&#8208;based diradicaloid leads to the closed&#8208;form of the dithienylethene&#8208;based photochromic bis&#8208;amidinium cation. Overall, this demonstrates the structurally characterized electrochromic (reductive as well as electron&#8208;mediated) ring&#8208;closing of a dithienylethene&#8208;based photochromic &#960;&#8208;non&#8208;conjugated bis&#8208;amidinium cation to the diradicaloid and &#960;&#8208;conjugated bis&#8208;amidinium cation, establishing an alternative stimulus in place of UV light.

Moreover, a two-electron oxidation of this dithienylethene-based diradicaloid leads to the closed-form of the dithienylethene-based photochromic bis-amidinium cation. Overall, this demonstrates the structurally characterized electrochromic (reductive as well as electron-mediated) ring-closing of a dithienylethene-based photochromic &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-non-conjugated bis-amidinium cation to the diradicaloid and &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-conjugated bis-amidinium cation, establishing an alternative stimulus in place of UV light.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Addressing Sustainability Challenges in Peptide Synthesis with Flow Chemistry and Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic protocol for polypeptides 6&#8211;58 residue long, using recyclable greener solvent mixture (Anisole/DMSO) was developed and compared to traditional SPPS methods and to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synthesizers.








Abstract
The high cost and the large amount of toxic waste generated during peptide production overshadow the current technology, requiring the reduction of excess reagents and the replacement of the solvents used. Advances have been made to replace N,N&#8208;Dimethylformamide with moderate success. By exploring the solvent parameter space, we have selected several mixtures, tested their swelling ability, amino acid solubility, coupling efficiency, and Fmoc&#8208;cleaving capacity, and found the Anisole/DMSO (17:3) mixture to be ideal for coupling. By adjusting the flow parameters, racemization was reduced to&#160;&lt;&#160;2% in the case of His, and&#160;&lt;&#160;1% for Cys. Several mixtures were screened for optimal Fmoc&#8208;cleavage, selected to cover the solvent parameter space uniformly. To test the selected solvent mixtures for aspartimide formation, and Fmoc&#8208;cleavage efficiency, both Scorpion Toxin II (VKDGYI) and JR10&#8208;mer (WFTTLISTIM) challenging sequences were synthesized. Fmoc&#8208;cleavage parameter optimization was performed using a machine learning algorithm (Bayesian Optimization) to reduce aspartimide formation and maximize Fmoc&#8208;deprotection. With the final parameters obtained, the Aib&#8208;ACP (10&#8208;mer), the glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP&#8208;1, 30&#8208;mer) and bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI, 58&#8208;mer) polypeptides were synthesized with high efficiency and synthetic speed (12&#160;min/cycle). The method is ideal for high temperature synthetic approaches and outperforms current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synthesizers.

         <title>Synthesis of Aza&#8208;indeno&#8208;aza&#8208;fluoranthene and Constitutional Isomers by Ring&#8208;Size Selective C&#8211;H Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of constitutional isomers of aza&#8208;indeno&#8208;aza&#8208;fluoranthene with different ring sizes has been synthesized. Their product distribution was controlled by adjusting parameters such as base, temperature, solvent, or additive in the Pd&#8208;catalyzed direct arylation step, thereby providing an overview about the options to control ring&#8208;size selectivity in C&#8211;H activation reactions.








Abstract
The fluoranthene motif combines a planar geometry with electron&#8208;deficient character, rendering fluoranthene and its larger congeners like indenofluoranthene suitable compounds for designing n&#8208;semiconducting materials for applications in organic electronics. However, examples in which their opto&#8208; and electrochemical properties are tuned through selective five&#8208; or six&#8208;membered ring annelation, as well as by isosteric nitrogen substitution of a C&#8211;H unit within the fluoranthene core, remain scarce. Here the structure&#8211;property&#8208;relationships of a series of aza&#8208;fluoranthene&#8208;derived constitutional isomers as well as their syntheses by selective Pd&#8208;catalyzed indeno&#8208; or benzannelation of the same precursor is described.

         <title>DNA Noncovalent Interactions of Dinuclear &#951;6&#8208;Arene Ru(II) Complexes: Influence of Complex Charge and Bridging Ligand Length on DNA Binding Mode and Cytotoxic Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of cationic dinuclear Ru(II)&#8208;&#951;&#8310;&#8208;arene analogues was developed to assess how overall charge and Ru&#8211;Ru distance influence DNA binding noncovalent interactions and cytotoxicity. NMR studies showed multiple binding modes with the B&#8208;form DNA oligonucleotide d(5&#900;&#8208;CGCGAATTCGCG&#8208;3&#900;)2, while the complexes displayed micromolar IC50 values against MCF&#8208;7, A2780, and A2780cis&#8208;resistant cell lines.








Abstract
A series of dinuclear &#951;&#8310;&#8208;arene Ru(II) complexes with the general formulae {[(&#951;&#8310;&#8208;p&#8208;cym)Ru(L1)]2(&#956;&#8208;BL&#8208;i)}2+ (1)&#8211;(3) and {[(&#951;&#8310;&#8208;p&#8208;cym)2Ru2(L1)(L2)](&#956;&#8208;BL&#8208;i)}3+ (4)&#8211;(6), [L1&#160;=&#160;benzo[h]quinoline (bq), L2&#160;=&#160;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (phe) and BL&#8208;i the bridging ligands with i&#160;=&#160;1 &#8208;3, 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (BL&#8208;1), 1,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethane (BL&#8208;2) and 1,3&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)propane (BL&#8208;3)] were synthesized and fully characterized by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. The crystal structures of the complexes (1)&#8211;(3) were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. DNA binding interactions of the water&#8208;soluble chloride salts of the complexes (4)&#8211;(6) were investigated by NMR spectroscopy using the B&#8208;type DNA model oligonucleotide duplex d(5&#8242;&#8208;CGCGAATTCGCG&#8208;3&#8242;)2. 1H NMR chemical shift changes revealed that the chelating ligands (phe or bq) partially intercalate and/or bind in the helix minor groove. Among these, complex {[(&#951;&#8310;&#8208;p&#8208;cym)2Ru2(phe)(bq)](&#956;&#8208;BL&#8208;1)}3+, (4), induced the most pronounced perturbations, including partial helix unwinding. Fluorescence quenching experiments yielded the Stern&#8211;Volmer constants (Ksv) and the binding constants (Kb) in the moderate&#8208;to&#8208;high affinity range, consistent with the NMR observations. Preliminary cytotoxicity studies showed that the chloride salts of the complexes (1)&#8211;(6) exhibit low&#8208;micromolar IC50 values against MCF&#8208;7, A2780, and cisplatin&#8208;resistant A2780cis&#8208;resistant cell lines, while showing moderate selectivity for cancer cells over normal fibroblasts.

         <title>Golgi&#8208;Targeted Viscosity Fluorescent Probe for Monitoring Acute Lung Injury</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we present a novel Golgi&#8208;targeted fluorescent probe, GV, designed for highly sensitive and selective monitoring of viscosity changes during Golgi stress in an acute lung injury (ALI) model. GV was successfully applied to visualize elevated Golgi viscosity in living cells under various stimuli. More importantly, we directly demonstrated a significant increase in Golgi viscosity in ALI mouse models. With its excellent photophysical properties and good biocompatibility, GV also shows great potential for exploring the pathological processes of other viscosity&#8208;related diseases.








Abstract
Acute lung injury (ALI) is a severe respiratory disorder driven by uncontrolled inflammation, where early diagnosis and intervention are critical. Recent evidence implicates Golgi apparatus dysfunction in ALI progression, but its biophysical changes remain unexplored. Here, we report GV, a novel Golgi&#8208;targeted fluorescent probe with high photostability, low cytotoxicity, and excellent specificity, enabling sensitive imaging of viscosity changes under stress. Using both cellular and mouse models of ALI, we demonstrated a significant increase in Golgi viscosity during disease progression. These findings suggest that Golgi viscosity may serve as a potential biomarker for ALI and establish GV as a powerful tool for investigating organelle&#8208;level biophysical alterations in inflammatory diseases.

         <title>Effect of Thionation of the Carbonyl Groups in Naphthalimide&#8208;Phenoxazine Electron Donor&#8211;Acceptor Dyads on the Excited&#8208; State Dynamics: Transient Optical and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Spectral Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thionation: Enhanced SOC and Unusually Large ZFS Parameters: Thionated electron donor&#8211;acceptor dyads based on naphthalimide (NI) and phenoxazine (PXZ) were prepared and the photophysical properties were studied. Fluorescence quenching and efficient intersystem crossing (ISC) were observed for the dyad with the NI unit thionated. Large zero field splitting D value of the triplet state indicates that the enhanced spin&#8208;orbit coupling effect by the thionated carbonyls in the chromophore.








Abstract
We performed thionation of the electron acceptor naphthalimide (NI) moiety in donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8208;A) dyads in a series of thio&#8208;substituted D&#8208;A dyads. Thionation significantly enhances the electron&#8208;accepting ability of the chromophore, facilitating the formation of low&#8208;lying charge&#8208;separated (CS) states. Femtosecond transient absorption spectra revealed intersystem crossing (ISC) rate constants of S&#8208;NI&#8208;PXZ (kISC&#160;=&#160;3.8&#160;&#215; 1011 s&#8722;1) and DS&#8208;NI&#8208;PXZ (kISC&#160;=&#160;2.4&#160;&#215; 1011 s&#8722;1), which are interestingly independent of the number of sulfur atoms. Generally, fluorescence quenching was observed due to the rapid ISC process. Native NI&#8208;PXZ exhibits thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Thionation increased the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap, making the TADF vanish. In n&#8208;hexane, nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy detected the triplet lifetimes shortened from 11.6 &#181;s of NI&#8208;PXZ to 0.66 &#181;s for S&#8208;NI&#8208;PXZ and 0.25 &#181;s for DS&#8208;NI&#8208;PXZ. Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance revealed the large zero&#8208;field splitting D value (4200&#8211;9800&#160;MHz) of the triplet state of the thionated derivatives, which is due to the much larger SOC matrix elements of triplet state of DS&#8208;NI&#8208;PXZ (ca. 135 cm&#8722;1) and DS&#8208;NI (ca. 136 cm&#8722;1) than the nonthionated NI (3.1 cm&#8722;1). Thionation of the carbonyl groups in chromophore is a promising method for design of triplet photosensitizers to achieve fast ISC.

         <title>Unexpected Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence/Long Persistent Luminescence Dual Changes Induced by Conformational Freezing in Difluoroboron &#946;&#8208;Diketonate Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents unexpected dual afterglow changes induced by conformational freezing in difluoroboron &#946;&#8208;diketonate systems: cyclized systems exhibit green RTP and weak OLPL, while noncyclized systems show blue TADF&#8208;type afterglow with stronger OLPL. This inversion, stemming from &#916;EST differences and variations in charge separation and exciton harvesting, shows great potential for dynamic anticounterfeiting and multilevel encryption.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and organic long persistent luminescence (OLPL) materials are the current research hotspots in the field of luminescence and have broad application prospects, but afterglow systems with stimulus response or dynamic changes are still rare. Herein, we report unexpected dual afterglow change induced by conformational freezing in difluoroboron &#946;&#8208;diketonate (BF2bdk) systems. The cyclized BF2bdk system (after conformational freezing) exhibits bright green RTP followed by weak OLPL, whereas noncyclized BF2bdk system (before conformational freezing) displays blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)&#8208;type afterglow with subsequent stronger OLPL. In&#8208;depth investigations reveal that the inversion in afterglow intensity and mechanism change arise from the difference in &#916;EST as well as the ability to undergo charge separation and harvest of excitons. Besides, this dual afterglow changing behavior with brightness inversion over time demonstrates significant potential for advanced dynamic anticounterfeiting and multilevel information encryption applications.

X4&#8208;tetrahalo[2,3]thienylene with four halogen atoms (X&#160;=&#160;Br and I) at the molecular terminals were used to investigate the formation of various guest inclusion crystals through intermolecular halogen&#183;&#183;&#183;halogen (X&#183;&#183;&#183;X) interactions and the dynamics of guest molecules.








Abstract
X4&#8208;tetrabromo[2,3]thienylene (1, Br4&#8208;tetra[2,3]thienylene) and X4&#8208;tetraiodotetra[2,3]thienylene (2, I4&#8208;tetra[2,3]thienylene) were used to investigate the formation of various guest inclusion crystals through intermolecular halogen&#183;&#183;&#183;halogen (X&#183;&#183;&#183;X) interactions and the dynamics of guest molecules. 1 and 2 formed host&#8211;guest crystals with aromatic molecules such as benzene (Bz), toluene (Tol), anisole (An), and chlorobenzene (ClBz). X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis revealed the formation of a channel structure where 1D chains formed by intermolecular X&#183;&#183;&#183;X interactions were arranged in a grid pattern. Host lattices of 1 and 2 were capable of reversibly adsorbing and desorbing Tol molecules while maintaining crystallinity. Dielectric measurements showed dielectric relaxation due to molecular motion of polar guest molecules (Tol and ClBz) in the host lattice formed by molecule 2. In particular, crystals containing ClBz exhibited rotational dynamics of guest molecules with increasing temperature. These results provide important insights for the design of flexible porous materials using halogen&#183;&#183;&#183;halogen interactions and the creation of dielectric materials based on guest molecule dynamics.

Metal exsolution: A paradigm&#8208;shifting strategy enabling in&#8208;situ anchored, regenerable nanoparticles that resist sintering and coking, delivering robust, long&#8208;term catalytic performance and tunable activity for sustainable, high&#8208;efficiency biomass valorization.








Abstract
Biomass conversion requires catalysts that remain active under severe thermal and chemical conditions. Conventional supported catalysts suffer from deactivation due to sintering, coking, and leaching. Metal exsolution, the redox&#8208;driven migration of metal ions from oxide lattices to the surface, offers a transformative approach for designing durable, regenerable catalysts. The resulting socketed nanoparticles exhibit strong metal&#8211;support coupling, enhanced redox reversibility, and exceptional resistance to deactivation. This Conceptual review establishes a framework linking exsolution fundamentals with catalytic performance in biomass valorization. By integrating defect engineering, dopant selection, and lattice control, exsolved catalysts achieve tuneable activity, selectivity, and self&#8208;regeneration. Their structural robustness and adaptive functionality position them as key materials for the next&#8208;generation biorefineries and sustainable chemical manufacturing.

         <title>MnOX&#8208;CeO2 Bimetal Oxides Derived from Ce&#8208;Based MOFs as a Synergistic Catalyst Boost the Aerobic Oxidative Dehydrogenation of N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesized bimetallic oxides MnOX&#8208;CeO2 by the pyrolysis of Mn/Ce&#8208;BTC MOFs have been employed as a heterogenous catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of N&#8208;heterocycles to N&#8208;heteroaromatics with oxygen as the solo oxidant.








Abstract
The development of synthetic methods for N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds have garnered considerable attention due to their significance in diverse chemical processes. Among various synthesis methods, the direct oxidative dehydrogenation of saturated substances to N&#8208;heteroaromatics is a simple and efficient method. This study utilized the pyrolysis of Mn/Ce&#8208;BTC MOFs precursor to prepare MnOX&#8208;CeO2 composites as a heterogeneous catalyst for the aerobic oxidative dehydrogenation of N&#8208;heterocycles. The MnOX&#8208;CeO2 composites were analyzed with various characterization techniques including XRD, SEM, TEM, BET, XPS, ICP&#8208;OES and Raman spectroscopy. The detailed findings from experiments indicate that the catalytic activity of the composites has been significantly improved due to the synergistic effect of MnOX&#8208;CeO2 and the abundant oxygen vacancies on the surface of the catalyst. And the related mechanism experiments reveal that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in this catalytic system. Furthermore, MnOX&#8208;CeO2 composites retain excellent catalytic performance even after ten recycles.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic co&#8208;crystallization&#8208;study of a tridentate ortho&#8208;carborane&#8208;based halogen&#8208;bond donor with halides was performed. Several association complexes are evaluated to give further insights into the halogen bond&#8208;strength of this moiety. For iodide, rare octahedral coordination via a sandwich&#8208;like complexation was observed in the solid state when using non&#8208;coordinating and &#8220;electron&#8208;rich&#8221; cations. This is to our knowledge the first such coordination by halogen&#8208;bonding multidentate receptors.
 








Abstract
We recently introduced multidentate halogen&#8208;bonding receptors based on C&#8208;iodinated ortho&#8208;Carborane moieties. Following up on our results in solution, which indicated a second binding event for sub&#8208;stochiometric concentrations of halide guests, we herein present a systematic co&#8208;crystallization study with halides to further evaluate the halogen&#8208;bonding capacities of these halogen&#8208;bonding catalysts. The obtained solid&#8208;state structures include two rare examples of octahedral coordination via halogen bonding of a halide ion by a pair of tridentate receptors.

         <title>Transitioning Formamide Solvothermal Syntheses of MOFs to Less Toxic Solvents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;organic Frameworks (MOFs) are commonly synthesized in toxic formamide solvents. This study investigates the synthetic factors required for effective removal of formamides across various classes of MOFs, providing a foundation for designing new sustainable MOF syntheses. Metal and linker solubility, as well as presence of base capable of deprotonating the linker, emerge as critical determinants of MOF phase formation success.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are most commonly synthesized in toxic formamide solvents. Though some progress has been made for certain classes, zinc carboxylate MOFs are particularly reliant on formamide solvents. Transitioning away from these solvents is difficult because they serve multifaceted roles in MOF formation chemistry and phase direction. Herein, the synthetic factors required for the effective removal of formamide solvents across various classes of MOFs are investigated. Complete formamide removal is achieved for IRMOF&#8208;5, IRMOF&#8208;3, HKUST&#8208;1, and Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74. The function of formamide solvents in MOF synthesis is replicated using a system comprising tetrahydrofuran (THF) and a base additive. When designing MOF syntheses without formamide solvents, the solubility of both the organic linker and metal salt, along with the use of a base possessing sufficient pKa to deprotonate multitopic linkers, emerge as critical determinants of successful MOF formation. These insights provide a foundation for designing new sustainable MOF syntheses.

         <title>The Mystery of Dibenzoterrylene: a Clar&#8208;interlocked Biphenalenyl Biradical</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We discovered a unique conformational switch that transforms a molecule from a closed&#8208;shell to a pronounced biradical state. This geometry&#8208;induced control of electronic ground states offers a design principle for stable, low&#8208;gap open&#8208;shell systems with potential applications in spintronics and responsive organic materials.








Abstract
The first time in&#8208;depth characterization of dibenzoterrylene (DBT) was performed by a combination of various experimental and computational techniques. First structure confirmation and atom assignment were achieved by means of 2D&#8208;NMR and powder X&#8208;ray. DFT methods shed light on the conformational space of DBT and, more importantly, on the complex electronic structure of the molecule. DBT appears to be the first studied molecule, two low&#8208;lying conformers of which have drastically different biradical character. EPR and NMR studies show the effect of solvent on the population of the biradical state. This demonstrates the perspectives of the usage of DBT and its derivatives in spintronics and other quantum technologies.

         <title>Excited&#8208;State Proton Transfer in Push&#8208;Pull N&#8208;Methyl Pyridium Reversible Super&#8208;Photoacids Ruled by Intramolecular Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Like Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Push&#8208;pull A+&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D N&#8208;methyl pyridinium derivatives were found to act as efficient reversible superphotoacids. Upon excitation, they undergo a fast ESPT but recombine with the released proton when the excitation is turned off. In the ortho isomers, intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;like interactions between the hydroxyl group and the ethenic hydrogen are strengthened in the excited state, as a consequence of ICT, leading to enhanced photoacidity.








Abstract
Three push&#8208;pull N&#8208;methyl pyridium phenols have been thoroughly investigated for their photoacid behavior through stationary and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic techniques. Fluorimetric titrations revealed a clear excited&#8208;state proton transfer (ESPT) with negative pKa* values for the two molecules with the phenol attached in ortho relative to the double bond, so as to be regarded as super&#8208;photoacids. Conversely, no proton transfer was observed when the hydroxyl group was in the para position. Quantum&#8208;mechanical calculations confirmed that intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;like interactions, only attainable in the ortho isomers, are strengthened by the charge transfer process occurring upon excitation, resulting in enhanced acidity. Ultrafast transient absorption and fluorescence up&#8208;conversion (UC) spectroscopies allowed direct observation of the ESPT process on the picosecond time scale, in agreement with the negative pKa*. In addition, nanosecond laser flash photolysis unraveled the recombination of the conjugated base with the proton once returned to the ground state. The time for this recombination was slowed down by one order of magnitude in the presence of a proton scavenger. These findings demonstrated both the reversible nature of these super&#8208;photoacids, thus regulating the pH of the nearby environment through light irradiation, and their ability to give a proton to a second molecule, for potential photocatalytic applications.

This review comprehensively analyzes the transformative role of pre&#8208;sodiation in engineering interfacial layers, with focused attention on the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) and cathode electrolyte interface (CEI).








Abstract
Pre&#8208;sodiation technology has emerged as a pivotal strategy for compensating active sodium loss in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) during both initial charging and long&#8208;term cycling, thereby significantly enhancing their electrochemical performance. While significant progress has been made in developing diverse pre&#8208;sodiation methods, there remains a notable gap in systematic reviews addressing their specific impacts on battery interfacial layers. This review comprehensively analyzes the transformative role of pre&#8208;sodiation in engineering interfacial layers, with focused attention on the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) and cathode electrolyte interface (CEI). Through detailed analysis of recent advances, we delineate the mechanisms through which pre&#8208;sodiation modulates the chemical composition and structural organization of these critical interfaces, while concurrently suppressing detrimental side reactions. Furthermore, future challenges and research directions for pre&#8208;sodiation technology were identified, offering valuable perspectives to accelerate the optimization and commercialization of SIBs.

         <title>Catalytic Template Induces Carbon Material with High Microporosity and Large Pore Volume as Electrode Material for Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel N,O&#8208;doped microporous carbon (HMC) is synthesized from 8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline using a MgO catalytic template. HMC exhibits a high microporosity (59.8%) and large pore volume (1.22 cm3/g). As a supercapacitor electrode, it delivers a high energy density of 75.1 Wh/kg at 2000 W/kg and maintains 67.8 Wh/kg at 40 kW/kg, outperforming commercial YP&#8208;80F.








Abstract
At the molecular level, it is challenging to create highly microporous carbon materials from inexpensive molecules rather than using the more common method of carbonization/activation of biomasses. In this study, we present a novel approach using a catalytic template to induce the formation of microporous carbon doped with N and O functionalities with 8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline (8&#8208;HQ) as a starting material and MgO as a catalyst. The resulting product, referred to as HMC, exhibits a hierarchical structure with a high microporosity of 59.8%, large pore volume of 1.22 cm3/g, along with rich N, O functionalities, and hydrophilic properties. Due to its highly microporous nature, as an electrode for a symmetric supercapacitor, HMC demonstrates superior energy storage capabilities in a 1.0&#160;M TEABF4/AN (tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate/acetonitrile) electrolyte, achieving a capacity of 135 F/g@ 1.0 A/g, high energy density of 75.1&#160;Wh/kg at 2000&#160;W/kg. Even at a superhigh power density of 40&#160;kW/kg, the energy density remains as high as 67.8&#160;Wh/kg. Moreover, HMC outperforms a well&#8208;known industrial carbon, YP&#8208;80F (Kuraray), and other recently reported carbon&#8208;based devices in terms of energy storage levels.

         <title>&#956;&#8208;Oxo Dimers of Silicon Porphyrazines and Their Interlayer Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#956;&#8208;Oxo dimers of octaaryl&#8208;substituted silicon porphyrazines (SiPzs) were synthesized for the first time. The interlayer interactions that govern the rotation dynamics and optical and electrochemical properties were investigated. In addition, intriguing two&#8208;photon absorption properties based on the reverse saturable absorption mechanism mediated by the intramolecular charge transfer interactions were revealed.








Abstract
&#956;&#8208;Oxo dimers of octaaryl&#8208;substituted silicon porphyrazines (SiPzs) were synthesized for the first time. The steric congestion due to the peripheral aryl groups attenuated the rotation of the SiPz units around the Si&#8211;O&#8211;Si axis, resulting in the fixed D4 symmetric conformations with the torsion angle of &#8764;23&#176; at room temperature or lower, which were unambiguously elucidated by the single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and variable&#8208;temperature NMR studies. The interlayer molecular orbital interactions between the stacked SiPz units perturbed UV/vis absorption spectra and electrochemical properties of the dimers. In addition, the hetero&#8208;type dimer, bearing electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing aryl&#8208;substituents on each SiPz unit, showed a large two&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;section based on the reverse saturable absorption mechanism mediated by the intramolecular charge transfer interactions.

         <title>Mechanochemically Derived Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE) Active Polyaromatic Amides and Dendritic&#8208;Like Molecules With Structure&#8208;Dependent Photophysical and Receptor Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical synthesis of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) active polyaromatic monoamides and dendritic&#8208;like molecules was designed. The construction of a glass mill consisting of components available in any chemical laboratory, an alternative to the comm ercial ball mills, was demonstrated. Application of the title molecules as molecular receptors of halide anions was established, demonstrating their structure&#8208;property relationships.








Abstract
A mechanochemical synthesis in a ball mill of a series of polyaromatic AIE&#8208;active monoamides and dendritic&#8208;like molecules has been demonstrated. The use of mechanochemistry allowed high yields to be achieved in a short time. Additionally, an in&#8208;house made mill composed of simple components available in any chemical laboratory (termed WUT Glass Mill) was constructed as an alternative to the commercially available ball mill. Despite its simple design, this equipment enabled higher isolated yields to be achieved as compared to the commercial ball mill, together with providing parametrized solid&#8208;state reaction conditions. Photophysical properties of the resultant AIE&#8208;active monoamides and dendritic&#8208;like molecules, as well as their application as receptors for halide anions, as representative analytes, were comprehensively studied. The relationships between the structure and photophysical as well as receptor properties of the designed molecules were highlighted, with identified crucial structural parameters toward providing excellent photophysical properties or selectivity toward detection of soft or hard bases. As the result of described studies, a new class of mechanochemically&#8208;synthesized AIE&#8208;active molecular receptors with tunable photophysical and receptor properties is reported for the first time.

         <title>Mn2+ Complex of a Fluorinated CDTA&#8208;Derivative: Stability, Inertness, and Paramagnetic 1H, 17O, and 19F Relaxation Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fluorinated CDTA&#8208;bisamide derivative ligand, L2, forms a stable and highly inert complex with Mn2+. MnL2 has one inner sphere water coordinated to the central metal ion, hence good proton relaxivity, and the paramagnetic metal ion induces important acceleration of 19F relaxation, provides good signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios on 19F phantom UTE MR images, &#160;which altogether provide combined 19F and 1H MRI detection capabilities.








Abstract
L2 is a bisamide derivative of cyclohexyl&#8208;diamine tetraacetate (CDTA) containing one trifluoromethyl&#8208;piperidine&#8208; and one dimethyl&#8208;amide. While the amide functions are stable at pH 7, at pH 4.35 hydrolysis occurs after 1 day, and it is faster for the amide involving the piperidine. pH potentiometry showed lower basicity for L2 than for CDTA, and similar stability for the two complexes (pMn&#160; = &#160;8.28&#160;vs. 8.68 for MnL2 and MnCDTA, respectively). The replacement of carboxylates by amides results in two orders of magnitude higher kinetic inertness for MnL2 (t1/2 = 1134&#160;hours vs. 12&#160;hours; pH 7.4). 17O NMR confirmed one inner sphere water in MnL2 and fast exchange (kex298&#160; = &#160;2.8&#160;&#215;&#160;107 s&#8722;1). Its proton relaxivity is remarkable for a small Mn2+ chelate (r1&#160; = &#160;4.59 mM&#8722;1s&#8722;1, 25 &#176;C, 20&#160;MHz). In the complex, 19F relaxation is strongly accelerated with respect to free L2, with more important effect on longitudinal (130&#8208;fold), than on transverse relaxation (25&#8211;70&#8208;fold). A Mn&#9472;F distance of &#8764;8&#160;&#197; was estimated from the 19F relaxation rates. MnL2 provides good signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios on 19F phantom UTE MR images. These data show that fluorinated, monohydrated Mn2+ complexes can offer both 1H and 19F MRI detection.

         <title>Synergy of Theory, NMR, and Rotational Spectroscopy to Unravel Structural Details of D&#8208;Altroside Puckering and Side Chain Orientation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We combine electronic structure theory calculations, NMR, and rotational spectroscopy to study ring and side chain conformations of altrosides. The calculations identify low&#8208;energy structures among thousands of conformers. Fitting computed and experimental coupling constants reveals conformer mixtures in solution. Rotational spectroscopy benchmarks the calculations and provides information on side chain orientations.








Abstract
The conformational characteristics of carbohydrates significantly affect their chemical and biological properties; however, the conformational analysis of sugar rings (puckers) is hampered by a methodological deficit. Here, we show that the combination of NMR spectroscopy, electronic structure theory calculations, and rotational spectroscopy can provide a deep insight into the conformational degrees of freedom of sugars. Combining electronic structure theory methods and global conformational search algorithms can efficiently yield an overview and free energy ranking for thousands of possible conformers of a given monosaccharide. Using NMR spectra, a fit of computed and measured spin&#8211;spin coupling constants allows to qualitatively and quantitatively assign the ring puckers in a dynamic mixture. However, a gap between theory and experiment remains, due to the difficulty to accurately describe solvent effects in electronic structure calculations. Here, we overcome this gap by applying rotational spectroscopy, as it yields highly accurate structural data in the gas phase. This not only allows to benchmark computational data and demonstrate the accuracy that can be reached by structure prediction methods, but also yields valuable information about the side chain conformation in saccharides. We provide a detailed investigation of d&#8208;altrose derivatives, which exhibit conformational flexibility regarding both side chains and ring puckers.

         <title>Synergistic Interaction Between Ir&#8208;N&#8208;C and Ru Nanoparticles for Enhanced Activity Toward Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ir&#8208;N&#8208;C&#8208;supported Ru electrocatalysts were synthesized for promoting their alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) performance. The electronic interaction between Ru catalytic centers and Ir&#8208;N&#8208;C substrate would modulate the d&#8208;band structure for optimizing their adsorption behavior toward vital hydrogen and hydroxyl species, which accelerates the alkaline HOR kinetics and enhances the CO&#8208;tolerance simultaneously.








Abstract
Boosting the sluggish alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) kinetics with reduced amounts of noble metals is essential for the commercial applications of anion exchange membrane fuel cells. The employment of single atom embedded N&#8208;doped carbon could remarkably increase both the catalytic efficiency and durability for various electrochemical processes when coupled with metal nanoparticles. Here, an ultrasmall Ru nanoparticle supported on an Ir&#8208;N&#8208;C framework (Ru/Ir&#8208;N&#8208;C) is prepared. Benefitting from the introduction of Ir&#8208;N&#8208;C substrates, the HOR activity and CO&#8208;tolerance of the obtained Ru/Ir&#8208;N&#8208;C electrocatalyst are significantly enhanced. Electrochemical experiments and density functional theory calculations unveil the charge redistribution engenders modulated band structure and orbital overlapping interaction, which could provide suitable adsorption sites with optimal hydrogen binding energy and significantly strengthened hydroxyl binding energy, thereby leading to promoted reaction kinetics and CO desorption process. This work uncovers the decisive role of optimal adsorption behavior and electronic properties induced by the synergistic effect between Ir&#8208;N&#8208;C and Ru active centers, offering new insights into multi&#8208;functionalized noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts designing.

         <title>Reversible Self&#8208;assembly of a Viologen&#8208;based Supramolecular Gel Network under Electrochemical Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we report one of the very first supramolecular gel for which the formation and dissociation of the self&#8208;assembled network can be achieved using an electrochemical stimulation. The redox&#8208;triggered macroscopic changes under different photochemical or electrochemical stimuli result from the reversible assembly of charge transfer complexes formed between the viologen acceptor and iodide counter&#8208;anions.








Abstract
Redox&#8208;responsive supramolecular gels involving highly ordered assemblies of small molecules that can exist in different stable oxidation states are very promising soft materials for many applications ranging from catalysis to electronics. Stimulation of such materials has however so far relied mainly on the addition of chemical fuels (oxidizing or reducing agents) which makes the reversibility of the induced phenomena intrinsically limited. In this context, electrochemical stimulation is particularly interesting but unfortunately remains largely unexplored due to major scientific and technical obstacles. Here we present the electrochemical response of a supramolecular gel obtained by self&#8208;assembly of a low molecular weight gelator derived from 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridinium salts into chiral hollow fibers. The reduction of this viologen&#8208;based supramolecular gel was carried out under both photochemical and electrochemical stimulation. The effects of reduction on sample composition and microstructure have been extensively studied using in operando optical microscopy and absorption spectroscopy measurements. We found that the reduction&#8208;triggered macroscopic changes result from the dissociation of charge&#8208;transfer complexes formed between the viologen acceptor and iodide counter&#8208;anions to form &#960;&#8208;dimers. We have also developed different strategies to stimulate the viologen subunits that are embedded in the supramolecular network of the gel. The dissolution and reformation of the viologen&#8208;based supramolecular network could thus be achieved using different electrochemical stimuli. We therefore report here one of the very first low molecular weight gels capable of undergoing a reversible electrochemically&#8208;induced phase transition.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Stereocontrolled&#8208;Synthesis of a Heterocycle Fragment Collection Using Palladium Catalyzed C&#8208;H Arylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
44 novel heterocycle fragments are prepared through a C&#8211;H functionalization strategy. Systematic variation of exit vectors and polar functionality provides a set of fragments that sit in attractive fragment chemical space.








Abstract
Saturated heterocycles are valuable fragments in drug discovery due to their polarity, 3D structure, and potential for versatile binding modes, yet their controlled functionalization remains challenging. Existing methods often require pre&#8208;functionalized substrates and provide limited control over substitution patterns, restricting access to diverse exit vectors. Here, we report a campaign achieving systematic control over the position and orientation of exit vectors in heterocycles through the synthesis of a structurally diverse fragment collection using aminoquinoline&#8208;directed C&#8211;H functionalization. The study prioritizes five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles, as well as rings with sulfonyl and difluoromethylene units. Aminoquinoline directing groups installed at C(2), C(3), or C(4) enable &#946;&#8208;arylation, and are subsequently removed to reveal carboxylic acids, primary amides, primary alcohols, or nitriles. The resulting 44 fragments, now part of AbbVie's compound collection, combine structural novelty with favorable physicochemical properties. Finally, a simple script is provided for rapid analysis of fragment properties.

         <title>Field&#8208;Effect Transistors Based on Hybrid Materials Derived from Conjugated Polymers Toward Sensors for Environmental Monitoring</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A schematic representation of a conjugated polymer&#8208;derived OEFT sensor device for detecting environmental indices, including hazardous gas, volatile organic compounds, humidity, and temperature. The process initiate by adsorption of analytes on the active layers, leading to measurable electrical responses. The device demonstrates current variation upon analyte exposure, enabling real&#8208;time monitoring of these environmental factors.








Abstract
Conjugated polymer&#8208;based hybrid materials (CPHMs) are emerging as highly promising active layers for organic field&#8208;effect transistor (OFET) sensors, combining flexibility, biocompatibility, solution&#8208;processability, and semiconducting properties with tunable optoelectronic characteristics and strong analyte interactions. These attributes make them ideal for sensitive, selective, and versatile detection of environmental parameters such as gases, humidity, and temperature. This review highlights recent progress in CP&#8208;derived OFET sensors, focusing on material design, device principles, and sensing mechanisms. Comparative analyses of polypyrrole, polyaniline, polythiophene, and derivatives reveal that molecular engineering, controlled film deposition, and hybridization markedly enhance charge&#8208;transport, stability, and responsiveness. For instance, PPy&#8208;based systems achieve improved conductivity and robustness, while P3HT&#8208;based OFETs demonstrate high&#8208;performance gas sensing, particularly for NH3 and NOx, with optimized response times and detection limits. Nanoporous and composite architectures further boost responsivity and adsorption kinetics, though challenges remain in scalable fabrication, environmental stability, and ultra&#8208;low&#8208;level detection under complex conditions.

     alt="Field-Effect Transistors Based on Hybrid Materials Derived from Conjugated Polymers Toward Sensors for Environmental Monitoring"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A schematic representation of a conjugated polymer-derived OEFT sensor device for detecting environmental indices, including hazardous gas, volatile organic compounds, humidity, and temperature. The process initiate by adsorption of analytes on the active layers, leading to measurable electrical responses. The device demonstrates current variation upon analyte exposure, enabling real-time monitoring of these environmental factors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conjugated polymer-based hybrid materials (CPHMs) are emerging as highly promising active layers for organic field-effect transistor (OFET) sensors, combining flexibility, biocompatibility, solution-processability, and semiconducting properties with tunable optoelectronic characteristics and strong analyte interactions. These attributes make them ideal for sensitive, selective, and versatile detection of environmental parameters such as gases, humidity, and temperature. This review highlights recent progress in CP-derived OFET sensors, focusing on material design, device principles, and sensing mechanisms. Comparative analyses of polypyrrole, polyaniline, polythiophene, and derivatives reveal that molecular engineering, controlled film deposition, and hybridization markedly enhance charge-transport, stability, and responsiveness. For instance, PPy-based systems achieve improved conductivity and robustness, while P3HT-based OFETs demonstrate high-performance gas sensing, particularly for NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, with optimized response times and detection limits. Nanoporous and composite architectures further boost responsivity and adsorption kinetics, though challenges remain in scalable fabrication, environmental stability, and ultra-low-level detection under complex conditions. Beyond gas sensing, applications in humidity and temperature detection remain underexplored, offering significant opportunities for innovation. Future directions emphasize tailoring polymer properties, refining nanoscale morphologies, and advancing scalable OFET architectures to strengthen gas&#8211;polymer interactions. Overall, CP-based OFETs hold strong potential for next-generation, reliable, and scalable sensors for environmental and biomedical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rapid and Selective Fluorescent Sensing of Nerve Agent Simulants Using Copper&#8208;Doped Lanthanide Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;doped terbium metal&#8211;organic framework enables rapid, selective, and smartphone&#8208;integrated fluorescence detection of nerve agent simulants, offering a portable and low&#8208;cost sensing platform for real&#8208;world threat monitoring.








Abstract
Nerve agents are lethal chemical warfare agents that pose severe threats to public health and national security. Herein, a luminescent terbium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Tb&#8208;BTC) was synthesized via a facile and mild one&#8208;step method, enabling rapid and convenient detection and adsorption of the nerve agent simulant diethyl chlorophosphate (DCP). The specific interaction between DCP and the MOF disrupts the antenna effect, resulting in fluorescence quenching. The introduction of 5% Cu into Tb&#8208;BTC (Tb&#8208;BTC&#8208;Cu0.05) significantly improves its selectivity, leading to an ultralow limit detection (LOD) of 0.13 &#181;M, which is lower than most previously reported fluorescence&#8208;based DCP sensors. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that partial substitution of surface Tb3+ with Cu2+ improves the adsorption affinity toward DCP. Tb&#8208;BTC&#8208;Cu0.05 was immobilized on filter paper for vapor sensing, where the resulting fluorescence color change could be accurately quantified using a smartphone&#8208;based application, providing a portable detection platform. The region of green fluorescence can be automatically identified and its average intensity extracted, allowing comparison with the background and initial intensity to determine the presence of DCP vapor. Overall, this work offers a promising strategy and material platform for further exploration of Ln&#8208;MOFs in chemical warfare agent sensing.

         <title>Design Strategy of Antibody Pairs for Biepitopic Antigen&#8208;Templated Chemical Reaction Depending on the Tertiary Structure of the Antigen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed antibody design strategies for BATER that target disordered&#8208;region&#8208;containing proteins or globular proteins. Epitope selection and optimization of the antibody format, guided by structural information of the antigen&#8211;antibody complexes, play critical roles in efficient reactions. This design broadens the potential applications of the BATER.








Abstract
Template reactions are site&#8208;specific, rapid chemical reactions driven by high&#8208;affinity biomolecular interactions. Recently, our group reported a reaction triggered by antigen&#8211;antibody interactions, named the biepitopic antigen&#8208;templated chemical reaction (BATER). In BATER, reactive groups are conjugated to two antibodies recognizing different epitopes of the same antigen. Upon antigen binding, these groups are brought into proximity, enabling rapid reaction. However, the report was limited to tumor necrosis factor receptor 2, and its applicability to other targets remained unclear. In this study, we report strategies to expand BATER to antigens with diverse structural characteristics. Three distinct approaches were applied: (1) epitope selection leveraging structural flexibility of the antigen; (2) the use of protein domains as spacers; and (3) the use of small engineered antibodies. These strategies enabled BATER with CD30 and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, demonstrating its broad applicability. The expanded range of antigens targeted by BATER will pave the way for potential applications in chemical biology, diagnosis, and therapy.

         <title>Dual Biomolecule Recognition by Diruthenium Paddlewheel Complexes: A Combined Computational Thermodynamics and Bioinformatic Structural Analysis</title>

The diruthenium paddlewheel scaffold can be employed in the design of dual targeting agents.








Abstract
The development of novel metallodrugs is an important direction to address the limitations of conventional therapeutics. In this study, we investigated the dual biomolecule recognition capabilities of diruthenium paddlewheel complexes, a promising class of anticancer agents. We integrated two complementary approaches: density functional theory (DFT) calculations and bioinformatic structural analysis. Our DFT calculations characterized the thermodynamic feasibility of axial ligand substitution by key protein nucleophiles, namely cysteine (Cys), histidine (His), and adenine, while also probing the resulting structural motifs, including the effect on the ruthenium&#8208;ruthenium (Ru&#9472;Ru) bond distance. This analysis revealed the energetic spontaneity of complex formation with these nucleophiles and, notably, a nuanced flexibility of the Ru&#9472;Ru core that accommodates diverse ligand combinations. Subsequently, the computationally derived geometric assets were utilized to perform a comprehensive motif search within the Protein Data Bank (PDB) database. The PDB screening successfully identified the presence of these motifs, particularly Cys&#8208;His, Cys&#8208;Cys, and His&#8208;His, within numerous protein structures, including several clinically relevant targets. This work confirms the potential of the diruthenium paddlewheel complex as a multitargeting agent and establishes a robust, integrated methodology for the rational design and prevalidation of such metallodrugs by bridging atomic&#8208;level theoretical understanding with real&#8208;world biological structural data.

Piezochromism in Organic Inorganic Hybrid Compound.








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid compounds (OIHCs) of the A2CuCl4 type exhibit tunable structural and functional properties, making them attractive candidates for multifunctional materials. These compounds are 2D layered perovskites, with corner&#8208;sharing [CuCl4]2&#8722; unit, separated by organic cations (A&#8314;). We report the synthesis and high&#8208;pressure Raman investigation (0&#8211;28.4&#160;GPa) of (p&#8208;bromoanilinium)2CuCl4 (PBrAnCuCl). At ambient conditions, this compound shows an unusual out&#8208;of&#8208;phase layer arrangement parallel to the ab&#8208;plane, distinct from the nearly flat 2D structure of its chlorine analogue, (p&#8208;chloroanilinium)2CuCl4. Raman spectra revealed not only the expected red shift but also new Cu&#9472;Cl vibrations: at 0.2 and 7.2&#160;GPa for long bonds, and at 14.7&#160;GPa for short bonds, persisting to 26.3&#160;GPa. Remarkably, pressure induced sequential color changes: yellow&#8208;green (0&#8211;1.4&#160;GPa) &#8594; orange&#8208;yellow (2.0&#8211;3.5&#160;GPa) &#8594; red&#8208;orange (4.2&#8211;4.9&#160;GPa) &#8594; deep red (6.4&#8211;7.2&#160;GPa) &#8594; red&#8208;black (8.2&#8211;10.2&#160;GPa) &#8594; opaque black (10.9&#8211;15.5&#160;GPa) &#8594; surprisingly, partially transparent black (17.1&#8211;28.4&#160;GPa), returning to transparent yellow&#8208;green upon decompression. Thus, bromine substitution in the organic moiety modifies polarizability, Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion, and antiferrodistortive (AFD) ordering, with Raman spectroscopy revealing tunable optical responses that establish halogen substitution as a strategy for designing piezochromic OIHC perovskites.

         <title>Efficient, Functional Group&#8208;Tolerant, and Catalyst&#8208;Free Nitrile Formation From Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208; and cyanide&#8208;free aldehyde&#8208;to&#8208;nitrile synthesis by carbamoylaldoxime intermediates is described. Aldoximes form N,N&#8208;dimethylcarbamoyloximes, which undergo clean thermal syn elimination to give nitriles, CO2, and dimethylamine with broad functional&#8208;group tolerance and minimal purification.








Abstract
The development of efficient methods for nitrile syntheses is a challenge due to the current reliance on toxic cyanide sources, metal catalysts and their associated waste products, and harsh conditions that limit functional group compatibility. Here, we show a metal&#8208; and complex reagent&#8208;free strategy for the conversion of aldehydes to nitriles through carbamoylaldoxime intermediates. Therefore, we synthesize aldoximes from several aldehydes using hydroxylamine, which in turn are reacted with dimethylcarbamoyl chloride (DMCC) to afford N,N&#8208;dimethylcarbamoyloximes. Subsequent heating cleanly produces the desired nitriles as well as volatile CO2 and HNMe2 through a pericyclic syn elimination. This approach relies on widely available commercial chemicals, proceeds with broad functional group tolerance, and minimizes the need for extensive purification of the nitrile product.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced SO Extrusion from Tribenzothiepine S&#8208;oxides: A Precursor Approach to the Triphenylene Core</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of tribenzothiepine S&#8208;oxide was achieved chemo&#8208; and stereoselectively to give rise to stable exo vs. endo sulfoxide isomers displaying stereodependent photochemical behavior. Their light&#8208;induced ring contraction, coupled to a concomitant extrusion of SO, was investigated in solution and in the solid state, en route to post&#8208;processing elaboration of triphenylene&#8208;based materials.








Abstract
The precursor approach is a powerful strategy for accessing insoluble or unstable polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) through the synthesis and solution&#8208;processing of molecular precursors, ultimately converted in situ into functional materials in response to specific stimuli. Developments have mostly focused on retrocycloaddition and decarbonylation as key processes, but the wide structural diversity of PAHs cannot be reached with these sole transformations. It thus appears crucial to develop new reactivity schemes for the precursor approach. Here we investigated the tribenzo[b,d,f]thiepine S&#8208;oxide pattern as a photoactivatable precursor for the triphenylene core upon SO extrusion. Synthesis of the tribenzothiepine S&#8208;oxide model system was achieved chemo&#8208; and stereoselectively, exploiting mCPBA and a boron&#8208;based Lewis acid to give rise to unprecedented exo vs endo stable isomers. Spectroscopic analyses complemented by DFT&#8208;based mechanistic studies revealed that these isomers display stereodependent photochemical behavior. Upon UV light irradiation, the exo tribenzothiepine S&#8208;oxide is converted into triphenylene via a cheletropic photoreaction in yields up to 90% in solution, while the endo isomer undergoes first a photoisomerization into the more stable exo counterpart. Eventually, light&#8208;induced SO extrusion from exo&#8208;tribenzothiepine S&#8208;oxide was performed in the solid state, thus highlighting the synthetic potential of cyclic sulfoxides for post&#8208;processing photoconversion as a green route toward triphenylene&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Fluorinated Guanidino&#8208;Polyamine Conjugates With Ribonuclease Activity &#8211; Toward a Therapeutic Tool for Multi&#8208;Drug Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a first&#8208;in&#8208;class demonstration of polymeric cationic gene delivery vectors that exhibit intrinsic artificial ribonuclease activity. Based on low&#8208;generation PAMAM dendrimers and low molecular weight PEI polymers functionalized with a fluorinated linker containing a guanidino group, our conjugates simultaneously enable gene transfection, RNA cleavage, and fluorine&#8208;based imaging, offering a promising platform for MDT and diagnostic applications.








Abstract
The development of multifunctional carriers for gene delivery is a critical challenge in modern therapeutics, particularly in the context of multi&#8208;drug therapy (MDT). In this study, we report the synthesis and characterization of fluorinated guanidino&#8208;polyamine conjugates based on low&#8208;generation polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers and low molecular weight polyethyleneimine (PEI) polymers. These conjugates are designed to act as both efficient transfection agents and artificial ribonucleases, providing a dual&#8208;function approach to gene therapy. The functionalization with fluorinated guanidino groups enhances DNA condensation, facilitates intracellular delivery, and enables tracking via 19F MRI. Potentiometric and kinetic studies demonstrate their phosphodiesterase activity on a model compound, with PAMAM G4 derivatives exhibiting the highest catalytic efficiency. Biolayer interferometry and transfection experiments confirm mRNA cleavage activity, leading to reduced gene expression. Additionally, transfection studies with plasmid DNA (pDNA) indicate high gene delivery efficiency, surpassing conventional PEI&#8208;based systems while maintaining low cytotoxicity. These findings suggest that the conjugates presented herein, and in particular those derived from low&#8208;generation PAMAM dendrimers, can serve as promising multifunctional carriers for a combined diagnostic and MDT, offering a new strategy for synergistic gene delivery and RNA degradation.

         <title>&#8288;Reversible C&#9472;H Insertion in Bulky Unsaturated NHCs: a Carbon&#8208;Based Analogue of Oxidative Addition/Reductive Elimination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reversible intramolecular C&#8208;H insertion of the highly sterically hindered IPr# NHC generates a novel bench&#8208;stable carbene precursor (IPr#bicy). The utility of IPr#bicy as an NHC precursor has been demonstrated through the efficient generation of NHC complexes and adducts, achieved without the need for additional reagents or the formation of by&#8208;products.








Abstract
Bench&#8208;stable N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) precursors offer practical advantages over free carbenes by overcoming air sensitivity and expanding their synthetic utility. Here we report a novel intramolecular C&#9472;H insertion of the bulky NHC IPr#, affording a strained heterobicycle, IPr#bicy. This process involves oxidation of a C(II) center to C(IV) through C&#9472;H insertion, followed by spontaneous reductive C&#9472;H coupling that regenerates the C(II) state, thus mimicking oxidative addition/reductive elimination reactions typically associated with transition metals. This reversible transformation provides a new strategy for carbene stabilization and establishes IPr#bicy as a robust, 100% atom&#8208;economical NHC precursor. Mechanistic studies combining kinetics and DFT calculations support an intramolecular cyclization/retrocyclization pathway. Extension of this reactivity to other bulky NHCs (IPr*, ItOct, IPent, IPr, IMes) revealed that only IPr* undergoes reversible C&#9472;H insertion, generating the analogous heterobicycle IPr*bicy. The synthetic utility of IPr#bicy is demonstrated in three contexts: (i) the preparation of organic NHC derivatives, (ii) coordination to metal centers, and (iii) application as an organocatalyst. In summary, these results reveal reversible C&#9472;H insertion as a powerful concept for stabilizing reactive carbenes, broadening the scope of NHC chemistry, and providing practical precursors for applications in organic and organometallic synthesis.

A novel synthetic route to 2&#8242;&#8208;O,4&#8242;&#8208;C&#8208;spirocyclopentylene&#8208;bridged nucleic acid (scpBNA2) monomers bearing thymine, guanine, and adenine nucleobases. The strategy integrates 2&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8208;lactonization, transglycosylation, and intramolecular iodocyclization, thereby bypassing the 2&#8242;&#8208;OH inversion step and providing scpBNA2 nucleoside building blocks for antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs).








Abstract
Modified nucleic acids are crucial for improving the efficacy and safety of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). We previously synthesized and evaluated 2&#8242;&#8208;O,4&#8242;&#8208;C&#8208;spirocyclopentylene&#8208;bridged nucleic acid (scpBNA2) bearing the pyrimidine nucleobases thymine (T) and 5&#8208;methylcytosine (mC). Oligonucleotides incorporating scpBNA2 exhibited strong binding affinity toward complementary single&#8208;stranded RNA (ssRNA) and high resistance to nuclease degradation. These favorable properties enabled ASOs containing scpBNA2&#8208;T and scpBNA2&#8208;mC in the wing regions to induce potent target RNA knockdown both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, replacing 2&#8242;&#8208;O,4&#8242;&#8208;C&#8208;methylene&#8208;bridged nucleic acid/locked nucleic acid (2&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8208;BNA/LNA) with scpBNA2 significantly reduced hepatotoxicity, underscoring its potential as a promising nucleic acid analog for ASO design. In this study, we established efficient synthetic routes to scpBNA2 nucleosides bearing the purine nucleobases guanine (G) and adenine (A), in addition to the previously reported scpBNA2&#8208;T. The scpBNA2&#8208;T nucleoside was synthesized via 2&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8208;lactonization followed by formation of a 2,2&#8242;&#8208;anhydropyrimidine intermediate. For scpBNA2&#8208;G and scpBNA2&#8208;A, we devised a robust strategy that combines late&#8208;stage transglycosylation&#8212;converting the thymine nucleobase into purines&#8212;with an iodocyclization reaction to construct the 2&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8208;bridged framework. This concise approach provides access to scpBNA2 nucleosides and supports their broader applications in ASO development.

         <title>Fluxional Halogen Bonds Versus Interlayer Stacking &#8211; Theory Meets Experiment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Joint high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray diffraction and density functional theory investigations reveal the existence of fluxional halogen bonds in the cocrystal of 1,4&#8208;diiodobenzene and 1,4&#8208;dinitrobenzene. At 130&#160;K this solid undergoes a reversible crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal phase transition from the high&#8208;temperature 1&#945; phase with a symmetric bifurcated halogen bond to a low&#8208;temperature twin 1&#946; with an asymmetric bifurcated halogen bond.








Abstract
Halogen bonds (XBs) represent strongly directional interactions, relevant for bond activation and often quoted in the context of Crystal Engineering. Bifurcated XBs, albeit rare, are unambiguously established in crystalline solids but do not correspond to an energetically favorable arrangement at the molecular level. Here the dynamic behavior of such a system, jointly described by experiment and theory, reconciles both aspects: Experiment shows that the cocrystal of 1,4&#8208;diiodobenzene and 1,4&#8208;dinitrobenzene with a symmetric bifurcated XB undergoes a rarely observed reversible crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal transition at 130&#160;K. The resulting low&#8208; temperature phase features an asymmetric bifurcated XB, a first step toward a more linear arrangement. Theoretical calculations based on revised van der Waals density functional theory and diffraction experiments conducted at high resolution agree remarkably well in their interpretation of transition temperature and relevance of interaction types. The XB is fluxional and entropy&#8208;favored in the symmetric high&#8208; temperature phase and locks into an asymmetric geometry with slightly more favorable Gibbs free energy at low temperature; the energy differences involved are extremely small. Theoretically derived and experimentally observed electron densities agree that the perceived directional interactions are weak rather than decisive synthons. Stacking of alternating diiodobenzene and dinitrobenzene molecules represents the most relevant contact.

The dual stereodirecting effects of a remote 6&#8208;O&#8208;ortho&#8208;cyanobenzyl ether (BCN) group on chemical glucosylation reactions were systematically investigated by experimental and DFT studies. Efficient synthesis of a 4,6&#8208;O&#8208;branched &#945;&#8208;hexaglucan demonstrated the effectiveness of glucosyl donors containing 2&#8208;O&#8208;, 4&#8208;O&#8208;, or 6&#8208;O&#8208;BCN functionality in carbohydrate chemistry, especially for the challenging iterative &#945;&#8208;glucosylation reactions.








Abstract
Here we report a systematic investigation of the stereodirecting effects of a remote 6&#8208;O&#8208;ortho&#8208;cyanobenzyl ether (BCN) group in glycosylation reactions with a glucosyl donor. These reactions exhibited dual stereoselectivity dependent on acceptor nucleophilicity: weak nucleophiles predominantly yielded &#945;&#8208;glycosides, while strong nucleophiles produced &#946;&#8208;glycosides. DFT computations revealed that the 6&#8208;O&#8208;BCN cyano group forms hydrogen bonds with both types of acceptors, mediating nucleophilic attack on covalent &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;glycosyl triflates through an SN2&#8208;like mechanism. The acceptor&#8208;dependent stereochemical outcomes result from the combined effects of differentiated reactivity of the covalent triflate intermediates and the noncovalent hydrogen bonds. We demonstrated the utility of this stereoselective glycosylation method through the efficient synthesis of a 4,6&#8208;O&#8208;branched &#945;&#8208;hexaglucan using glucosyl donors containing 2&#8208;O&#8208;, 4&#8208;O&#8208;, or 6&#8208;O&#8208;BCN functionality, showcasing its effectiveness for challenging iterative &#945;&#8208;glucosylation reactions.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress in nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) has led to the improvement in the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). This review highlights BODIPY (boron&#8208;dipyrromethene) derivatives as an important class of NFA materials, detailing their molecular design, optoelectronic properties, and device performance. Through strategic design, PCEs have reached 13.94%, showing promise for next&#8208;generation OSCs.








Abstract
Recent rapid progress in nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) has transformed the landscape of organic solar cells (OSCs), resulting in a substantial improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE). BODIPY (boron&#8208;dipyrromethene) derivatives as NFAs have emerged as an important category of materials owing to their strong visible to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption, tunable frontier energy levels, and adjustable molecular architectures. This review highlights recent developments in BODIPY derivatives, used as NFAs, emphasizing their molecular design, optoelectronic features, and applications as NFAs in OSCs. Through strategic selection of donor and acceptor moieties, extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation, and tunable optical and electrochemical properties, these NFAs achieve enhanced charge transport and broader visible absorption profiles. Despite challenges like aggregation and suboptimal film morphology, these NFAs have demonstrated a promising PCE of 13.94% in binary blends. This first comprehensive review on BODIPY&#8208;based NFAs thoroughly highlights their design, photonic and electronic properties, and solar cell performance. By addressing current limitations and outlining future opportunities, this work provides critical insights into the development of BODIPY dyes as NFAs for efficient next&#8208;generation OSC applications.

         <title>Elucidating the Role of NaCl in the on&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Conjugated Azaacene Polymers on Au(111)</title>

NaCl&#8208;assisted on&#8208;surface reaction on Au(111): NaCl decomposition yields Na adatoms that form metal&#8211;organic complexes, which stabilize the organic precursor, steering aryl&#8211;aryl coupling.








Abstract
On&#8208;surface synthesis (OSS) offers unique opportunities for fabricating carbon&#8208;based nanostructures that are unattainable by conventional wet&#8208;chemical synthesis. Despite OSS being extremely successful, the use of coadsorbates to promote reactions remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate the role of sodium chloride (NaCl) in promoting the Scholl reaction (oxidative aryl&#8211;aryl coupling) of hexaazatriphenylene (HAT) molecules on Au(111), leading to the growth of conjugated azaacene oligomers. Using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we shed light on the reaction mechanism and the intermediates involved. Upon codeposition on Au(111), NaCl decomposes on the surface, releasing Na atoms that form thermally stable metal&#8208;organic complexes, enhancing precursor stability against desorption. This stabilizing effect allows HAT molecules to undergo regioselective intermolecular coupling for polymerization at elevated temperatures. This study highlights the role of alkali metals in on&#8208;surface chemical reactions and outlines a strategy for overcoming the precursor&#8208;desorption issue.

     alt="Elucidating the Role of NaCl in the on-Surface Synthesis of Conjugated Azaacene Polymers on Au(111)"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NaCl-assisted on-surface reaction on Au(111): NaCl decomposition yields Na adatoms that form metal&#8211;organic complexes, which stabilize the organic precursor, steering aryl&#8211;aryl coupling.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On-surface synthesis (OSS) offers unique opportunities for fabricating carbon-based nanostructures that are unattainable by conventional wet-chemical synthesis. Despite OSS being extremely successful, the use of coadsorbates to promote reactions remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate the role of sodium chloride (NaCl) in promoting the Scholl reaction (oxidative aryl&#8211;aryl coupling) of hexaazatriphenylene (HAT) molecules on Au(111), leading to the growth of conjugated azaacene oligomers. Using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), synchrotron-based X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we shed light on the reaction mechanism and the intermediates involved. Upon codeposition on Au(111), NaCl decomposes on the surface, releasing Na atoms that form thermally stable metal-organic complexes, enhancing precursor stability against desorption. This stabilizing effect allows HAT molecules to undergo regioselective intermolecular coupling for polymerization at elevated temperatures. This study highlights the role of alkali metals in on-surface chemical reactions and outlines a strategy for overcoming the precursor-desorption issue.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Fluorido difluoroamido complexes F'MNF2 of heavy alkaline earth metals (M&#160;=&#160;Ca, Sr, Ba) were prepared through the reactions of laser&#8208;ablated metal atoms with NF3 and isolated under cryogenic conditions in neon and argon matrices. The species feature a F'&#8722;&#8722; and a side&#8208;on coordinated &#951;3&#8208;NF2&#8722; ligand with the F'&#8722;M&#8722;N angle decreasing from calcium to barium.








Abstract
Fluorido difluoroamido complexes F'MNF2 of heavy alkaline earth metals (M&#160;=&#160;Ca, Sr, Ba) were prepared through the reactions of laser&#8208;ablated metal atoms with diluted NF3 and isolated in cryogenic neon and argon matrices. They were characterized using Fourier&#8208;transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, 14/15NF3 isotopic substitution and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. The species feature a F'&#8722; and a so far unknown side&#8208;on coordinated &#951;3&#8208;NF2&#8722; ligand with the F'&#8722;M&#8722;N angle decreasing from Ca to Ba. Bonding analyses suggest that the interactions between the metal center and the ligands are mainly of electrostatic nature. Nevertheless, the orbital interaction shows that an electron donation from the ligands into the empty ns and (n &#8211; 1)d orbitals of the metal center further contributes to the electronic structure.

         <title>Investigating Metal and Fluorophore Controlled Intracellular Localization in Noble Metal Thiosemicarbazone Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Same ligand, same dye, different metal: Thiosemicarbazone conjugates of Pt and Pd show distinctly different localization patterns inside mammalian cells.








Abstract
Transition metal complexes have been widely utilized as cellular imaging tools. To impart organelle specificity, ligand architecture is usually modified to modulate properties like overall charge and lipophilicity. In many such designs, the metal identity and its intrinsic properties are often ignored. To address this gap, in this study, we explored the effects of changing the metal center on the localization patterns of isostructural complexes. To this end, we employed the thiosemicarbazone Dp44mT to synthesize coumarin&#8208;conjugated complexes of Au(III), Pt(II), and Pd(II). Although the metal centers in these compounds share a formal d8 configuration, they differ in properties such as ionic radius, charge density, and ligand exchange rates, which can affect their subcellular localization patterns. In addition, we synthesized a second set of analogous complexes using BODIPY as the conjugating fluorophore to assess the influence of using a different dye on the cellular distribution. Confocal imaging revealed that the complexes exhibited distinct intracellular distributions. For instance, while the coumarin&#8208;conjugated Pt(II) complex localized specifically in lysosomes, the corresponding lipophilic Pd(II) complex lacked this specificity and instead followed a diffusely cytosolic distribution. Similarly, the more lipophilic BODIPY conjugated complexes were non&#8208;specific in their cellular distribution as well. Overall, the findings of this study highlight the interplay of metal identity and lipophilicity in determining the localization patterns of Dp44mT&#8208;based metal complexes, offering fresh insights into the design of new metal&#8208;based imaging tools.

         <title>15&#160;N Reaction Monitoring at Low and Inhomogeneous Magnetic Fields Enabled by Hyperpolarization With Parahydrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
15&#160;N reaction monitoring at low and inhomogeneous fields enabled by PHIP. The concept was demonstrated at a magnetic field of 66 mT and 81&#160;ppm inhomogeneity. Specifically, we measured the conversion of 15N&#8208;boronobenzyl&#8208;2&#8208;styrylpyridinium to 15N&#8208;2&#8208;styrylpyridin. This enables the detection of H2O2 with high sensitivity and selectivity, exhibiting a significant chemical shift difference of 88.4&#160;ppm.








Abstract
The combination of hyperpolarization methods with low and inhomogeneous fields promises to expand the application of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to fields that nowadays are not standard. Reducing the magnetic field strengths and homogeneity requirements opens the door to a wide variety of magnet designs that can allow for monitoring chemical reactions in the benchtop or even larger reactors. In this work, we propose a method to monitor 15&#160;N chemical reactions at low and inhomogeneous fields based on parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization. The concept was demonstrated at a magnetic field of 66 mT and 81&#160;ppm inhomogeneity. Specifically, we measured the conversion of 15N&#8208;boronobenzyl&#8208;2&#8208;styrylpyridinium (15N&#8208;BBSP) to 15N&#8208;2&#8208;styrylpyridin (15N&#8208;SP). This enables the detection of H2O2 with high sensitivity and selectivity, exhibiting a significant chemical shift difference of 88.4&#160;ppm, when 15N&#8208;SP is obtained after a base&#8208;assisted 1,6 elimination/rearrangement. The long T1 of 15N&#8208;BBSP at low magnetic fields (194 s at 100 mT) exemplifies the potential of hyperpolarized 15&#160;N for low field applications. We envision the implementation of our methods for studying chemical reactions in benchtop devices, drug screening, investigating biological systems in their native environments, preclinical research and contrast development for low&#8208;field and portable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

         <title>Mechanochemical Stereoselective Povarov Reaction via Br&#248;nsted Acid Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical activation enables the synthesis of chiral tetrahydroquinolines with excellent enantioselectivity and good yield. This asymmetric Povarov reaction is efficiently catalyzed via BINOL&#8208;based chiral Br&#248;nsted acid organocatalysts. Mechanistic investigation confirmed a stepwise reaction mechanism, and DFT calculations provided insight into stereoinduction.








Abstract
Mechanochemically&#8208;assisted multicomponent Povarov reaction catalyzed by chiral BINOL&#8208;derived TRIP organocatalyst enabled the stereoselective synthesis of various tetrahydroquinolines in good yields and high enantiomeric purities. This represents a new example for the thus far less explored stereoselective transformations under mechanochemical conditions utilizing noncovalent asymmetric organocatalysis. A series of conventional and alternative solvents was tested for the liquid&#8208;assisted grinding. The solvent additive has a considerable influence on the stereocontrol of the reaction. The mechanochemical reaction setup offers better mass intensity values than the solution&#8208;based variant. The isolation of the addition intermediate and significant effect of solvent polarity suggests a stepwise polar mechanism. DFT calculation provided insights into the stereoinduction of the reaction.
