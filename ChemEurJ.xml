         <title>Recent&#160;Advances&#160;in Aerobic Oxidative of&#160;C&#8208;H Bond by Molecular Oxygen Focus on Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aerobic oxidative cross coupling represents one of the most straightforward and atom&#8208;economic methods for construction of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;X (X = N, O, S, or P) bonds using air as a sustainable external oxidant. The oxidative coupling of C&#8208;H bonds in heterocyclic compounds can effectively increase their molecular complexity by introducing new functional groups through C&#8208;H bond activation, or by formation of new heterocyclic structures through cascade construction of two or more sequential chemical bonds. This is very useful as it can increase the potential applications of these structures in natural products, pharmaceuticals, agricultural chemicals, and functional materials. This is a representative overview of recent progress since 2010 on green oxidative coupling reactions of C&#8208;H bond using O2 or air as internal&#160;oxidant focus on Heterocycles. It aims to provide a platform for expanding the scope and utility of air as green oxidant, together with a brief discussion on research into the mechanisms behind it.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Alkylated Pyridoxal Derivatives as Negative Electrolyte Materials for Aqueous Organic Flow Batteries: Computational Screening

N&#8208;functionalized pyridinium molecules derived from the three major vitamers of vitamin B6, pyridoxal, pyridoxamine and pyridoxine, have been screened computationally for consideration as negative electrode materials in aqueous organic flow batteries.







Abstract
N&#8208;functionalized pyridinium frameworks derived from the three major vitamers of vitamin B6, pyridoxal, pyridoxamine and pyridoxine, have been screened computationally for consideration as negative electrode materials in aqueous organic flow batteries. A molecular database including the structure and the one&#8208;electron standard reduction potential of related pyridinium derivatives has been generated using a computational protocol that combines semiempirical and DFT quantum chemical methods. The predicted reduction potentials span a broad range for the investigated pyridinium frameworks, but pyridoxal derivatives, particularly those involving electron withdrawing substituents, have potentials compatible with the electrochemical stability window of aqueous electrolytes. The stability of radicals formed upon one&#8208;electron reduction has been analyzed by a new computational tool proposed recently for large&#8208;scale computational screening.

         <title>Orthogonal Strategies for Profiling Potential Cellular Targets of Anandamide and Cannabidiol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Affinity&#8208;based protein profiling (AfBPP) and &#8216;label&#8208;free&#8217; 2D&#8208;TPP (2 Dimensional&#8208;Thermal Protein Profiling) platforms have been used to identify potential cellular targets of cannabinoids, especially cannabidiol (CBD), leading to the discovery of both shared and unique protein targets. Subsequent target validation led to the conclusion that this 2D&#8208;TPP strategy complements well with AfBPP.







Abstract
The human endocannabinoid system regulates a myriad of physiological processes through a complex lipid signaling network involving cannabinoids and their respective receptors, cannabinoid receptor 1 (hCB1R) and cannabinoid receptor 2 (hCB2R). Anandamide (AEA) and cannabidiol (CBD) are classical examples of cannabinoids that elicit a variety of effects, both beneficial and detrimental, through these receptors. Mounting evidence suggested the presence of other potential cannabinoid targets that may be responsible for other observable effects. However, prior pharmacological studies on these cannabinoid compounds provided scant evidence of direct engagement to these proposed targets. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, no chemoproteomic studies have been demonstrated on CBD. Here we showed that, by taking advantage of a recently developed &#8216;label&#8208;free&#8217; 2D&#8208;TPP (2 Dimensional&#8208;Thermal Protein Profiling) approach, we have identified several new putative targets of both AEA and CBD. Comparison of these interaction landscapes with those obtained from well&#8208;established affinity&#8208;based protein profiling (AfBPP) platforms has led to the discovery of both shared and unique protein targets. Subsequent target validation of selected proteins led us to conclude that this 2D&#8208;TPP strategy complements well with AfBPP.

         <title>From Terminal to Spiro&#8208;Phosphonium Acceptors, Remarkable Moieties to Develop Polyaromatic NIR Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low energy absorption and emission were realized in a series of anthracene&#8208;derived donor&#8208;acceptor phosphonium dyes. The electron deficiency of the rare phospha&#8208;spiro architecture allowed to achieve fluorescence at 797&#8197;nm in dichloromethane and at 860&#8197;nm in the solid state.







Abstract
Phosphonium&#8208;based compounds gain attention as promising photofunctional materials. As a contribution to the emerging field, we present a series of donor&#8208;acceptor ionic dyes, which were constructed by tailoring phosphonium (A) and extended &#960;&#8208;NR2 (D) fragments to an anthracene framework. The alteration of the &#960;&#8208;spacer of electron&#8208;donating substituents in species with terminal &#8722;+PPh2Me groups exhibits a long absorption wavelength up to &#955;abs=527&#8197;nm in dichloromethane and shifted the emission to the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region (&#955;=805&#8197;nm for thienyl aniline donor), although at low quantum yield (&#934;&lt;0.01). In turn, the introduction of a P&#8208;heterocyclic acceptor substantially narrowed the optical bandgap and improved the efficiency of fluorescence. In particular, the phospha&#8208;spiro moiety allowed to attain NIR emission (797&#8197;nm in dichloromethane) with fluorescence efficiency as high as &#934;=0.12. The electron&#8208;accepting property of the phospha&#8208;spiro constituent outperformed that of the monocyclic and terminal phosphonium counterparts, illustrating a promising direction in the design of novel charge&#8208;transfer chromophores.

         <title>Cyanine&#8208; and Rhodamine&#8208;Derived Alkynes for the Selective Targeting of Cancerous Mitochondria through Radical Thiol&#8208;Yne Coupling in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyanine&#8211;aryl acetylene conjugates (pink) accumulate in the mitochondria of cancer cells, where the elevated pH and reactive oxygen species (white) levels allow the formation of thiyl radicals (yellow glowing pin and first arrow) from thiols (dark yellow pin). The activation enables radical thiol&#8208;yne coupling of biomolecules to the dye&#8211;alkyne conjugate (second arrow). This represents a powerful tool for the selective targeting of cancerous mitochondria through physicochemical accumulation and stimuli&#8208;responsive reactivity. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Mokhir, M.&#8197;R. Heinrich and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301340).

         <title>Flexible self&#8208;powered energy systems based on H2O/Ni2+ intercalated NixV2O5&#8901;nH2O</title>

         <dc:description>The development of portable electronic devices has created greater demands for multifunctional energy integration systems. Self&#8208;powered systems have gained widespread interest because they can collect and storage renewable environmental energy and provide stable electricity to electronic devices. Herein, we developed a flexible self&#8208;charging energy system, involving textile&#8208;based zinc&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitor (ZIHC) and triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), which demonstrates wearable, compatibility, lightweight and can quickly harvest and store energy. NixV2O5&#8901;nH2O (NVO) loaded on carbon cloth (CC) with Ni2+/H2O ions intercalated as the cathode was assembled with activated CC to form a ZIHC, which has a voltage range of 2.0 V and capacitance value of 267.1 mF cm&#8208;2 as well as good charge and discharge rates and excellent cycling stability. At the same time, the NVO/CC can be assembled with PDMS to form a TENG achieving a maximum instantaneous power of 18.5mW cm&#8208;2. The device can be flexibly worn over the body to continuously harvest and store biomechanical energy and charge the electronic wristwatch successfully. This work demonstrates great convenience and promising practical applications as sustainable flexible energy system for portable electronic devices.</dc:description>

Abstract
Low band gap materials have always been a focus of attention due to their potential applications in various fields. In this work, a series of asymmetric bistricyclic aromatic ene (BAE) compounds with fluorenylidene&#8208;cyclopentadithiophene (FYT) skeleton were facially synthesized, which were modified with different substituents (&#8722;OMe, &#8722;SMe). The FYT core exhibit twisted C=C bond with dihedral angles around 30&#176;, and the introduction of &#8722;SMe group can provide additional S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S interaction between molecules, which is conducive to the charge transporting. The UV&#8208;Vis spectra, electrochemistry and photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that these compounds have relatively narrow band gaps, particularly, the &#8722;SMe modified compounds have slightly lower HOMO and Fermi energy levels than that of the &#8722;OMe modified compounds. Furthermore, PSCs devices were fabricated with the three compounds as HTMs, and FYT&#8208;DSDPA exhibit the best performance among them, revealing the fine&#8208;tuning band structure could influence properties of HTMs.

         <title>Effect of Flexible Spacer and Alkyl Tail Length on the Liquid Crystalline Phase Behavior of Fullerene Block Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel superlattice containing 3 hydrocarbon single layers alternating with 4 fullerene 2D crystals can be generated in a wide range of fullerene block molecules (n=10 or 12; m=5&#8211;7), owing to the cooperative effect of a long spacer and short terminal tails. This offers a practical way to construct unconventional semi&#8208;conductive superstructures.







Abstract
Here the supramolecular liquid crystalline (LC) phase behavior of a series of fullerene block molecules was investigated regarding spacer length, alkyl tail length and temperature. These compounds exhibit several lamellar LC phases with different packings of self&#8208;organized fullerene two&#8208;dimensional (2D) crystals. With a short hexamethylene spacer, they form sandwich&#8208;like structures with triple or quadruple fullerene layers. By increasing the spacer length to 10 or 12 carbons, a composite layers&#8208;in&#8208;lamella superlattice structure with alternating soft hydrocarbon single layers and fullerene single or double layers was obtained. As the molecular configurational freedom between incompatible moieties was enhanced by the elongated spacer, the required cross&#8208;sectional fullerene&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbon ratio for the superlattice could be achieved despite of different volume fractions of the blocks. The superlattice phase range is efficiently widened by the design principle of constructing LC molecules with a long spacer, which also provides a facile way to tailor novel superstructures.

         <title>Photochemically Mediated Toluene Oxidation through a Copper Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method to oxidize toluene selectively to benzaldehyde photochemically is described. A series of copper(I) complexes with different ligands were applied in combination with [Ru(bipy)3](PF6)2 and dioxygen as the oxidant. The copper(II) complexes obtained after oxidation were photochemically reduced to the starting copper(I) species, and the process can be repeated continuously.







Abstract
A method is described to photochemically oxidize toluene selectively to benzaldehyde, an essential compound in the chemical industry. Copper(I) complexes with different ligands were applied in combination with [Ru(bipy)3](PF6)2 and dioxygen as the oxidant. As a result, a &#8220;dioxygen adduct&#8221; copper complex, for example, a peroxido complex, is formed as the active species. The copper(II) complex obtained after oxidation can be photochemically reduced to the starting copper(I) species, and the process can be repeated continuously. The ligand tris(2&#8208;methylpyridyl)amine (tmpa) led to the highest conversion rates.

         <title>RNA&#8208;Catalyzed RNA Ligation within Prebiotically Plausible Model Protocells
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ribozyme capable of functioning at low Mg2+ concentrations catalyzes efficient template&#8208;directed ligation of RNA substrates inside a prebiotically plausible fatty acid protocell. Compartmentalized RNA assembly catalyzed by ribozymes is central to the viability of spontaneously evolving protocells.







Abstract
Demonstrating RNA catalysis within prebiotically relevant models of primordial cells (protocells) remains a challenge in origins of life research. Fatty acid vesicles encapsulating genomic and catalytic RNAs (ribozymes) are attractive models for protocells; however, RNA catalysis has largely been incompatible with fatty acid vesicles due to their instability in the presence of Mg2+ at the concentrations required for ribozyme function.

&lt;p&gt;A ribozyme capable of functioning at low Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentrations catalyzes efficient template-directed ligation of RNA substrates inside a prebiotically plausible fatty acid protocell. Compartmentalized RNA assembly catalyzed by ribozymes is central to the viability of spontaneously evolving protocells.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demonstrating RNA catalysis within prebiotically relevant models of primordial cells (protocells) remains a challenge in origins of life research. Fatty acid vesicles encapsulating genomic and catalytic RNAs (ribozymes) are attractive models for protocells; however, RNA catalysis has largely been incompatible with fatty acid vesicles due to their instability in the presence of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; at the concentrations required for ribozyme function. Here, we report a ribozyme that catalyzes template-directed RNA ligation at low Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentrations and thus remains active within stable vesicles. Ribose and adenine, both prebiotically relevant molecules, were found to greatly reduce Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-induced RNA leakage from vesicles. When we co-encapsulated the ribozyme, substrate, and template within fatty acid vesicles, we observed efficient RNA-catalyzed RNA ligation upon subsequent addition of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Our work shows that RNA-catalyzed RNA assembly can occur efficiently within prebiotically plausible fatty acid vesicles and represents a step toward the replication of primordial genomes within self-replicating protocells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Turning the Imidazole Core into Three&#8208;Dimensional Ring Systems: Mild Organocatalytic Entry to Enantiopure 6,7&#8208;Dihydrobenzimidazoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The challenging side of simplicity: Easily available imidazole&#8208;based substrates were coupled with &#946;&#8208;aryl enals via eliminative [4+2] cycloaddition under mild aminocatalytic conditions to access rare chiral [d]&#8208;fused imidazole ring systems with optimal enantio&#8208; and regioselectivity and good potential for post&#8208;cycloaddition functional group editing.







Abstract
Organocatalytic asymmetric transformation of common aromatic heterocycles via in&#8197;situ formation of highly reactive dearomatized ortho&#8208;quinodimethane diene species and subsequent [4+2] cycloaddition with suitable dienophiles has become a powerful tool to enter cyclohexane&#8208;fused heterocycles. Most of these reactions were previously applied to benzo&#8208;fused heterocycles or poorly aromatic rings. Herein, we disclose how previously intractable aromatic imidazole rings, equipped with removable methylidene malononitrile activating handle, could be involved as competent cycloaddends with &#946;&#8208;aryl enals in efficient eliminative [4+2] cycloadditions under mild organocatalytic conditions. This method allowed the efficient and direct preparation of scantly represented 6,7&#8208;dihydrobenzo[d]imidazoles with optimal enantio&#8208; and regioselectivities. Post&#8208;cycloaddition chemical editing provided imidazole&#8208;based ring systems with diverse oxidation state and functional groups.

         <title>Organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid crystal&#8208;assisted etching of nickel foam for the collectively exhaustive electrochemical performance of oxygen evolution reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid crystal, violet&#8208;crystal (VC), was used to etch the nickel foam (NF) to fabricate a self&#8208;standing electrode for the water oxidation reaction. The efficacy of VC&#8208;assisted etching manifests the promising electrochemical performance towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), requiring only ~356 and ~376 mV overpotentials to reach 50 and 100 mA cm&#8208;2, respectively. The OER activity improvement is attributed to the collectively exhaustive effects arising from the incorporation of various elements in the NF, and the enhancement of active site density. Furthermore, the self&#8208;standing electrode is robust, exhibiting a stable OER activity after 4,000 cyclic voltammetry cycles, and ~ 50 h. The anodic transfer coefficients (aa) show that the first electron transfer step is the rate&#8208;determining step on the surface of NF&#8208;VCs&#8208;1.0 (NF etched by 1 g of VCs) electrode, while the chemical step involving dissociation following the first electron transfer step is identified as the rate&#8208;limiting step in other electrodes. The lowest Tafel slope value observed in the NF&#8208;VCs&#8208;1.0 electrode indicates the high surface coverage of oxygen intermediates and more favorable OER reaction kinetics, as confirmed by high interfacial chemical capacitance and low charge transport/interfacial resistance.</dc:description>

         <title>Graphdiyne and its Composites for Lithium&#8208;Ion and Hydrogen Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Graphynes (GYs) are a novel type of carbon allotrope composed of sp and sp2 hybridized carbon atoms, boasting both a planar conjugated structure akin to graphene and a pore&#8208;like configuration in three&#8208;dimensional space. Graphdiyne (GDY), the first member of GYs family, has gained much interest due to its fascinating electrochemical properties including a greater theoretical capacity, high charge mobility and advanced electronic transport properties, making it a promising material for energy storage applications for lithium&#8208;ion and hydrogen storage. Various methods, including heteroatom substitution, embedding, strain, and nanomorphology control, have been employed to further enhance the energy storage performance of GDY. Despite the potential of GDY in energy storage applications, there are still challenges to overcome in scaling up mass production. This review summarizes recent progress in the synthesis and application of GDY in lithium&#8208;ion and hydrogen storage, highlighting the obstacles faced in large&#8208;scale commercial application of GDY&#8208;based energy storage devices. Suggestions on possible solutions to overcome these hurdles have also been provided. Overall, the unique properties of GDY make it a promising material for energy storage applications in lithium&#8208;ion and hydrogen storage devices. The findings presented here will inspire further development of energy storage devices utilizing GDY.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intermolecular [2+2] photodimerization provides a distinctive approach to construct photoresponsive fluorescent materials in a manner of switching on solid&#8208;state fluorescence. Herein, we report efficient photoactivation of bright solid&#8208;state fluorescence based on controllable intermolecular [2+2] photodimerization reaction of benzo[b]thiophene 1,1&#8208;dioxide (BTO) derivatives, which provides a simple and effective way to construct smart photoresponsive solid&#8208;state fluorescent materials. Rational choice of substituent in BTO molecular skeleton enables them to efficiently undergo photodimerization through regulating molecular stacking in crystal, and also leads to photoactivation of solid&#8208;state fluorescence due to the generation of brightly fluorescent photodimers. This intermolecular photodimerization reaction also offers an effective method to synthesize photostable AIEgens with purely through&#8208;space conjugation.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatiotemporal Investigation of Intercellular Heterogeneity via Multiple Photocaged Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intercellular heterogeneity occurs widely under both normal physiological environments and abnormal disease&#8208;causing conditions. Several attempts to couple spatiotemporal information to cell states in a microenvironment were performed to decipher the cause and effect of heterogeneity. Furthermore, spatiotemporal manipulation can be achieved with the use of photocaged/photoactivatable molecules. Here, we provide a platform to spatiotemporally analyze differential protein expression in neighboring cells by multiple photocaged probes coupled with homemade photomasks. We successfully established intercellular heterogeneity (photoactivable ROS trigger) and mapped the targets (directly ROS&#8208;affected cells) and bystanders (surrounding cells), which were further characterized by total proteomic and cysteinomic analysis. Different protein profiles were shown between bystanders and target cells in both total proteome and cysteinome. Our strategy should expand the toolkit of spatiotemporal mapping for elucidating intercellular heterogeneity.</dc:description>

         <title>Anti&#8208;Migratory and Cytotoxic Activities of [Ga(8&#8208;hydroxyquinolinato)3]: Roles of Endogenous Cu(II) and Drug&#8208;Induced Phenotypic Changes.</title>

         <dc:description>As shown by IncuCyte Zoom imaging proliferation assays, invasive triple&#8208;negative human breast MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cancer cells treated with sub&#8208;toxic doses (5.0&#8208;20 &#956;M, 72 h) of [GaQ3] (Q = 8&#8208;hydroxyquinolinato) caused profound morphological changes and inhibition of cell migration, which were likely due to terminal cell differentiation or similar phenotypical change. This is the first demonstration of potential use of a metal complex in differentiation anti&#8208;cancer therapy. Additionally, a trace amount of Cu(II) (0.20 &#956;M) added to the medium dramatically increased [GaQ3] cytotoxicity (IC50 ~ 2 &#956;M, 72 h) due to its partial dissociation and the action of the HQ ligand as a Cu(II) ionophore, as shown with electrospray mass spectrometry and fluorescence spectroscopy assays in the medium. Hence, cytotoxicity of [GaQ3] is strongly linked to ligand binding of essential metal ions in the medium, e.g., Cu(II). Appropriate delivery mechanisms of such complexes and their ligands could enable a powerful new triple therapeutic approach for cancer chemotherapy, including cytotoxicity against primary tumour, arrest of metastases, and activation of innate and adaptive immune responses.</dc:description>

         <title>In Vitro Selection and Characterization of a DNAzyme Probe for Diverse Pathogenic Strains of Clostridium difficile</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 36, June 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clostridium difficile frequently causes an infectious disease known worldwide as Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). An RNA&#8208;cleaving fluorogenic DNAzyme was selected that does not recognize other species of bacteria but can be sensitively activated by diverse clinical strains of C.&#8197;difficile. Such a synthetic DNAzyme can easily be incorporated into various biosensor designs to diagnose CDI.







Abstract
Clostridium difficile frequently causes an infectious disease known as Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), and there is an urgent need for the development of more effective rapid diagnostic tests for CDI. Previously we have developed an RNA&#8208;cleaving fluorogenic DNAzyme (RFD) probe, named RFD&#8208;CD1, that is capable of detecting a specific strain of C.&#8197;difficile but is too specific to recognize other pathogenic C.&#8197;difficile strains. To overcome this issue, herein we report RFD&#8208;CD2, another RFD that is not only highly specific to C.&#8197;difficile but also capable of recognizing diverse pathogenic C.&#8197;difficile strains. Extensive sequence and structure characterization establishes a pseudoknot structure and a significantly minimized sequence for RFD&#8208;CD2. As a fluorescent sensor, RFD&#8208;CD2 can detect C.&#8197;difficile at a concentration as low as 100&#8197;CFU/mL, thus making this DNAzyme an attractive molecular probe for rapid diagnosis of CDI caused by diverse strains of C.&#8197;difficile.

         <title>The Interplay between Different Stimuli in a 4D Printed Photo&#8208;, Thermal&#8208;, and Water&#8208;Responsive Liquid Crystal Elastomer Actuator</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 36, June 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes the synthesis of a new azobenzene molecule which, when incorporated in a liquid crystal elastomer, allows responsivity to environmental changes in lighting, temperature, and hydration. The underwater actuation behavior of bilayer films of the elastomer deposited on thin, inert polymer substrates depends on the combination of lighting conditions temperature of the aqueous environment.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;stimuli responsivity in 3D&#8208;printed objects is receiving much attention. However, the simultaneous interplay between different environmental stimuli is largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate direct ink writing of an oligomeric ink containing an azobenzene photo&#8208;switch with an accessible hydrogen bond allowing triple responsivity to light, heat, and water. The resulting printed liquid crystal elastomer performs multiple actuations, the specific response depending on the environmental conditions. Bilayer films formed by printing on a static substrate can rapidly change shape, bending almost 80 degrees if irradiated in air or undergoing a shrinkage of about 50&#8201;% of its length when heated. The bilayer film assumes dramatically different shapes in water depending on combined environmental temperature and lighting conditions.

         <title>A Playground for Heavy Atom Tunnelling: Neutral Substitutional Defect Rearrangement from Diamondoids to Diamonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 36, June 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic impurities in small and large diamond&#8208;like clusters can be rearranged by heavy atom quantum tunnelling. Computations show how the rate of reaction depends on the nature of the atom, the temperature, and the size of the cage. Moreover, it can be artificially accelerated by external electric fields, an effect that might be exploited to create atomic memory devices.







Abstract
Many diamond properties are defined by substitutional defects (i.&#8201;e., a carbon atom replaced by another element), which may involve the formation of structural isomers that can interconvert. Herein, we analysed by computational means the structure, thermodynamics, and kinetics of substitutional nitrogen, boron, and oxygen from small diamondoids up to the diamond bulk, focusing on the possibility of heavy atom quantum tunnelling rearrangement between the isomers. The large range of threshold energies and bond lengths lead to a variety of intriguing behaviours, including cage size dependent thermally activated tunnelling of nitrogen, and quantum delocalization of boron. In addition, we predict that applying an external electric field makes it possible to control the rearrangement thermodynamics and kinetics through tunnelling, which lets us hypothesize that these systems can potentially be used as atomic memory devices.

         <title>Bis[1]benzothieno[1,4]thiaborins as a Platform for BODIPY Singlet Oxygen Photosensitizers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 36, June 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the synthesis and physicochemical studies of two regioisomeric &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;extended [1,4]thiaborins annulated with two benzothiophene units. They were used as scaffolds to construct thiaborin&#8208;based BODIPY singlet&#8208;oxygen photosensitizers with evident potential for use as photocatalysts.







Abstract
A synthetic approach to two regioisomeric &#960;&#8208;electron extended [1,4]thiaborins annulated with two benzothiophene units has been developed. The central thiaborin rings of the boracycles obtained exhibit different electronic properties; this is reflected in their different aromatic characters, boron Lewis acidity and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopic behavior. Thiaborins were converted to boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) complexes. Their emission spectra exhibit two distinct bands resulting from 1LE and 1CT transitions. Strong near&#8208;infrared phosphorescence in Zeonex thin films at 77&#8197;K indicates efficient intersystem crossing and the formation of triplet states. Separation of HOMO and LUMO orbitals between boracyclic and BODIPY moieties facilitates electron transfer to a 1CT state followed by a transition to the 3LE triplet state located on the ligand. These unique properties of spiro thiaborin&#8208;BODIPY complexes were explored for their application as singlet&#8208;oxygen photosensitizers. They show excellent photocatalytic performance with singlet oxygen quantum yields reaching 77&#8201;% and full conversion of the model organic substrate achieved after 1.5&#8197;h with only 0.05&#8201;%&#8201;mol catalyst load.

&lt;p&gt;We present the synthesis and physicochemical studies of two regioisomeric &#960;-electron-extended [1,4]thiaborins annulated with two benzothiophene units. They were used as scaffolds to construct thiaborin-based BODIPY singlet-oxygen photosensitizers with evident potential for use as photocatalysts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A synthetic approach to two regioisomeric &#960;-electron extended [1,4]thiaborins annulated with two benzothiophene units has been developed. The central thiaborin rings of the boracycles obtained exhibit different electronic properties; this is reflected in their different aromatic characters, boron Lewis acidity and UV-vis spectroscopic behavior. Thiaborins were converted to boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) complexes. Their emission spectra exhibit two distinct bands resulting from &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;LE and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;CT transitions. Strong near-infrared phosphorescence in Zeonex thin films at 77&#8197;K indicates efficient intersystem crossing and the formation of triplet states. Separation of HOMO and LUMO orbitals between boracyclic and BODIPY moieties facilitates electron transfer to a &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;CT state followed by a transition to the &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;LE triplet state located on the ligand. These unique properties of &lt;i&gt;spiro&lt;/i&gt; thiaborin-BODIPY complexes were explored for their application as singlet-oxygen photosensitizers. They show excellent photocatalytic performance with singlet oxygen quantum yields reaching 77&#8201;% and full conversion of the model organic substrate achieved after 1.5&#8197;h with only 0.05&#8201;%&#8201;mol catalyst load.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cooperative Supramolecular Polymerization of Triphenylamine bis&#8208;Urea Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 36, June 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cooperative assembly of a triphenylamine bis&#8208;urea macrocycle appended with exterior tridodecyloxy benzene solubilizing groups has been examined in organic (THF) and aqueous (H2O/THF) media. In presence of guests, known to fit in the columnar channels, the nucleation step is similar while the elongation process is slightly more favorable. In comparison, the addition of diphenylsulfoxide causes a decrease in aggregate size, likely acting as a chain stopper.







Abstract
Herein, we probe the hydrogen bond&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of a triphenylamine (TPA) bis&#8208;urea macrocycle in the presence and absence of guests. Comprised of methylene urea&#8208;bridged TPAs with exterior tridodecyloxy benzene solubilizing groups, the macrocycle exhibits concentration&#8208;dependent aggregate formation in THF and H2O/THF mixtures as characterized by 1H&#8197;NMR and DOSY experiments. Its assembly processes were further probed by temperature&#8208;dependent UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy. Upon heating, UV/Vis spectra exhibit a hypsochromic shift in the &#955;max, while fluorescence spectra show an increase in emission intensity. Conversely, the protected macrocycle that lacks hydrogen bond donors demonstrates no significant change. Thermodynamic analysis indicates a cooperative self&#8208;assembly pathway with distinct nucleation and elongation regimes. The morphology and structure of the aggregate were elucidated by dynamic light scattering, atomic force microscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Variable temperature emission spectra were utilized to monitor the impact of guests, such as diphenylacetylene, that can be bound in the columnar channels. The findings suggest that the elongation of assemblies is influenced by the presence of these guests. In comparison, diphenyl sulfoxide, likely functioning as a chain stopper, limited the assembly size. These studies suggest that judicious selection of (co)monomers may modulate the function and utility of these supramolecular systems.

         <title>Synthesis and Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship Studies of C(13)&#8208;Desmethylene&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;Zampanolide Analogs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 36, June 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reduced or demethylated variants of a C(13)&#8208;desmethylene congener of the marine microtubule stabilizer (&#8722;)&#8208;zampanolide have been prepared by HWE&#8208;based macrocyclization and stereoselective construction of the hemiaminal center in the side chain. While all modifications led to reduced growth inhibitory activity, the 2,3&#8208;dihydro and the C(17)&#8208;desmethyl variants retained potent antiproliferative activity with single&#8208;digit to low&#8208;double&#8208;digit nanomolar IC50 values against several cancer cell lines.







Abstract
We describe the synthesis and biochemical and cellular profiling of five partially reduced or demethylated analogs of the marine macrolide (&#8722;)&#8208;zampanolide (ZMP). These analogs were derived from 13&#8208;desmethylene&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;zampanolide (DM&#8208;ZMP), which is an equally potent cancer cell growth inhibitor as ZMP. Key steps in the synthesis of all compounds were the formation of the dioxabicyclo[15.3.1]heneicosane core by an intramolecular HWE reaction (67&#8211;95&#8201;% yield) and a stereoselective aza&#8208;aldol reaction with an (S)&#8208;BINOL&#8208;derived sorbamide transfer complex, to establish the C(20) stereocenter (24&#8211;71&#8201;% yield). As the sole exception, for the 5&#8208;desmethyl macrocycle, ring&#8208;closure relied on macrolactonization; however, elaboration of the macrocyclization product into the corresponding zampanolide analog was unsuccessful. All modifications led to reduced cellular activity and lowered microtubule&#8208;binding affinity compared to DM&#8208;ZMP, albeit to a different extent. For compounds incorporating the reactive enone moiety of ZMP, IC50 values for cancer cell growth inhibition varied between 5 and 133&#8197;nM, compared to 1&#8211;12&#8197;nM for DM&#8208;ZMP. Reduction of the enone double bond led to a several hundred&#8208;fold loss in growth inhibition. The cellular potency of 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;13&#8208;desmethylene zampanolide, as the most potent analog identified, remained within a ninefold range of that of DM&#8208;ZMP.

         <title>Assembling Artificial Photosynthetic Models in Water Using &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin&#8208;Conjugated Phthalocyanines as Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 36, June 27, 2023. </description>

&#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin&#8208;conjugated zinc(II) phthalocyanines form stable host&#8211;guest complexes with a tetrasulfonated porphyrin and sodium 2&#8208;anthraquinonesulfonate (AQ) in water. Upon excitation of the porphyrin unit, they undergo excitation energy transfer followed by electron transfer as shown by various spectroscopic methods, functioning as artificial photosynthetic models.







Abstract
Two water&#8208;soluble zinc(II) phthalocyanines substituted with two or four permethylated &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD) moieties at the &#945; positions have been utilized as building blocks for the construction of artificial photosynthetic models in water. The hydrophilic and bulky &#946;&#8208;CD moieties not only can increase the water solubility of the phthalocyanine core and prevent its stacking in water but can also bind with a tetrasulfonated zinc(II) porphyrin (ZnTPPS) and/or sodium 2&#8208;anthraquinonesulfonate (AQ) in water through host&#8211;guest interactions. The binding interactions of these species have been studied spectroscopically, while the photoinduced processes of the resulting complexes have been investigated using steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic methods. In the ternary complexes, the ZnTPPS units serve as light&#8208;harvesting antennas to capture the light energy and transfer it to the phthalocyanine core via efficient excitation energy transfer. The excited phthalocyanine is subsequently quenched by the electron&#8208;deficient AQ units through electron transfer. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy provides clear evidence for the singlet&#8208;singlet energy transfer from the photo&#8208;excited ZnTPPS to the phthalocyanine core with a rate constant (kENT) in the order of 109&#8197;s&#8722;1. The population of phthalocyanine radical cations indicates the occurrence of electron transfer from the excited phthalocyanine to the AQ moieties, forming a charge&#8208;separated state.

         <title>Combining Enantioselective Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Conjugate Addition and Ir&#8208;Catalyzed Allylic Alkylation in Stereodivergent, Multicomponent Coupling Reactions to Form Three Stereocenters
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 36, June 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stereodivergent three&#8208;component coupling of enones, aryl boron nucleophiles and allyl carbonates can be achieved with a combination of Rh&#8208; and Ir&#8208;based catalysts. Products containing three contiguous stereocenters can be prepared with &gt;95&#8201;%&#8201;ee and &gt;90&#8201;:&#8201;10&#8197;dr.







Abstract
Stereodivergent dual catalysis has emerged as a powerful tool to selectively prepare all four stereoisomers in molecules containing two chiral centers from common starting materials. Most processes involve the use of two substrates, and it remains challenging to use dual catalyst approaches to generate molecules having three newly formed stereocenters with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Here we report a multicomponent, stereodivergent method for the synthesis of targets containing three contiguous stereocenters by the combination of enantioselective Rh&#8208;catalyzed conjugate addition and Ir&#8208;catalyzed allylic alkylation methodologies. Both cyclic and acyclic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones undergo &#946;&#8208;arylation using aryl boron reagents to form an enolate nucleophile that can be subsequently allylated at the &#945;&#8208;position. The reactions proceed often with &gt;95&#8201;%&#8201;ee and with &gt;90&#8201;:&#8201;10&#8197;dr. Epimerization at the &#945;&#8208;carbonyl center enables the preparation of any of the eight possible stereoisomers from common starting materials, as demonstrated for cyclohexanone products.

         <title>CO2 Activation on Cu/TiO2 Nanostructures: Importance of Dual Binding Site</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 36, June 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO2 adsorption and activation on Cu SAC and Cu10 nanoclusters supported on rutile(110) and anatase(101) TiO2 surfaces, both pristine and reduced, has been investigated. It was found that CO2 is activated only when the molecule can simultaneously bind to at least two active sites. The morphology of the support is essential.







Abstract
CO2 adsorption and activation on Cu single atom catalysts and Cu nanoclusters supported on the (110) surface of rutile and on the (101) surface of anatase TiO2 have been investigated by means of first principles electronic structure calculations. The role of oxide reduction associated to the presence of oxygen vacancies has been considered. Five main messages emerge from this study. (1) CO2 activation on Cu/TiO2 nanostructures is surface sensitive, as the rutile and anatase surfaces can exhibit different behaviors; (2) the surface morphology is essential since CO2 is activated only when the molecule can simultaneously bind to at least two active sites, such as a Cu atom on one side and an oxide ion on the other site; (3) Cu atoms on TiO2 are in the +I oxidation state and can bind and activate CO2 via charge transfer from the oxide; (4) on supported Cu clusters CO2 activation occurs mostly at the metal/oxide interface; (5) the presence of O vacancy sites facilitates the spontaneous dissociation of CO2 to CO, or increases the electron density of the metal catalyst, two effects that can influence the mechanism of CO2 reduction to methanol or other chemicals.

         <title>Photoluminescence Properties of Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes Influenced by the Tether Length of Reagents with Two Reactive Sites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 36, June 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light controlled by tether length: New insights into controlling the photoluminescence (PL) properties of nanotubes were obtained. The tether length of alkylation reagents showed significant selectivity toward controlling the NIR PL wavelength of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes.







Abstract
The functionalization of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) is an effective method for controlling a local band gap, resulting in photoluminescence (PL) in the near&#8208;infrared region. Herein, SWNTs were functionalized using a series of bromoalkanes and dibromoalkanes to evaluate the effects of their length on the nanotube PL properties. When bromoalkanes (CnH2n+1Br) or dibromoalkanes (CnH2nBr2) with tether lengths of six or more were utilized for six different semiconducting SWNTs, the obtained SWNT adducts exhibited two new PL peaks, whereas dibromoalkanes with tether lengths of 3&#8211;5 (CnH2nBr2: n=3&#8211;5) produced single peaks. Combined with theoretical calculations, the results suggested that the tether length of reagents changes the formation mechanism of functionalized adducts, that is, CnH2nBr2 (n=3&#8211;5) tends to result in kinetic products.

         <title>Intermolecular Dearomative 1,2&#8208;Amination/Carbonylation via Nucleophilic Addition of Simple Amines to Arene &#960;&#8208;Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 36, June 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel multicomponent reaction for dearomative 1,2&#8208;amination/carbonylation of chromium&#8208;bound arenes using simple amines as nitrogen source has been developed, providing rapid access to poly&#8208;functionalized alicyclic compounds containing amino and amide functionalities.







Abstract
The incorporation of the privileged amino functionality is of paramount importance in organic synthesis. In contrast to the well&#8208;developed amination methods for alkenes, the dearomative amination of arenes is largely underexplored due to the inherently inert reactivity of arene &#960;&#8208;bonds and selectivity challenges. Herein, we report an intermolecular dearomative aminofunctionalization via direct nucleophilic addition of simple amines to chromium&#8208;bound arenes. This multicomponent 1,2&#8208;amination/carbonylation reaction enables rapid access to complicated alicyclic compounds containing amino and amide functionalities from benzene derivatives under CO&#8208;gas&#8208;free conditions, which also represents the first application of nitrogen&#8208;based nucleophiles in &#951;6&#8208;coordination&#8208;induced arene dearomatizations.

         <title>UV&#8208;Blocking and Light&#8208;Responsive Poly (&#1013;&#8208;Caprolactone)/ZIF&#8208;8 Multifunctional Composite Films for Efficient Antibacterial Activities</title>

PQZ composite films have many concurrent properties, including antibacterial, UV&#8208;blocking, hydrophobicity, thermal stability, and high tensile strength, which are extremely important for their application as food packaging materials.







Abstract
Antibacterial photodynamic therapy (APDT) has received considerable attention owing to its superiority. ZIF&#8208;8 was used to address the poor stability of the photosensitizer Rose Bengal (RB) encapsulation to synthesize RB@ZIF&#8208;8 NPs, which were doped into a composite film with poly (&#1013;&#8208;caprolactone) (PCL) and polyvinyl alcohol&#8208;quaternary ammonium chitosan (PVA&#8208;QCS) as substrates to form composite films (PQZ). The composite films exhibited excellent photodynamic sterilization and good resistance to bacterial adhesion. The tensile strength of the film increased to 43.4&#8197;MPa, which was approximately 1.8&#8197;times that of the PCL film. With the addition of SiO2 and RB@ZIF&#8208;8 NPs, the film exhibited water repellency and UV&#8208;blocking properties. RAW264.7&#8197;cells were selected using the MTT method to confirm that the composite films had excellent biocompatibility and had no significant inhibitory effect on cell growth and reproduction. PQZ multifunctional composite films show potential as novel APDT antimicrobial materials for food packaging.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Extension of the Tribenzotriquinacene Framework: Efficient Vinylene and Arylene Bay Bridging Based on a New C3&#8208;Symmetric Key Derivative</title>

Polyaromatic compounds: The C3&#8208;symmetric tribromotribenzotriquinacene (TBTQ) derivative 6, easily prepared from readily available starting materials, serves as a key compound for the threefold 1,2&#8208;arylene as well as vinylene bay&#8208;bridging of the TBTQ core.







Abstract
1,5,9&#8208;Tribromo&#8208;2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexamethoxy&#8208;4b1&#8208;methyltribenzotriquinacene, a C3&#8208;symmetric TBTQ derivative, can be prepared conveniently and with high regioselectivity from readily available starting materials. It is a versatile key compound for the synthesis of other chiral 1,5,9&#8208;trifunctionalized TBTQ derivatives and &#960;&#8208;extended congeners in which the bays of the TBTQ skeleton are bridged by vinylene and 1,2&#8208;arylene units. X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy show that vinylene bay&#8208;bridging enables better &#960;&#8208;conjugation with the arene rings of the TBTQ core than 1,2&#8208;arylene bay&#8208;bridging does.

         <title>Kinetic Resolution of 2&#8208;Aryldihydroquinolines Using Lithiation &#8211; Synthesis of Chiral 1,2&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;Dihydroquinolines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 36, June 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric synthesis of substituted dihydroquinolines was achieved using a kinetic resolution of 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines with n&#8208;BuLi and the chiral ligand sparteine. Subsequent lithiation at C&#8208;2 and trapping with an electrophile occurs at C&#8208;4 with retention of stereochemistry to provide an unusual route to enantiomerically enriched 1,4&#8208;dihydroquinolines.







Abstract
Highly enantiomerically enriched dihydrohydroquinolines were prepared in two steps from quinoline. Addition of aryllithiums to quinoline with tert&#8208;butoxycarbonyl (Boc) protection gave N&#8208;Boc&#8208;2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines. These were treated with n&#8208;butyllithium and electrophilic trapping occurred exclusively at C&#8208;4 of the dihydroquinoline, a result supported by DFT studies. Variable temperature NMR spectroscopy gave kinetic data for the barrier to rotation of the carbonyl group (&#916;G&#8800;&#8776;49&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, 195&#8197;K). Lithiation using the diamine sparteine allowed kinetic resolutions with high enantioselectivities (enantiomer ratio up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1). The enantioenriched 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines could be converted to 1,4&#8208;dihydroquinolines with retention of stereochemistry. Further functionalisation led to trisubstituted products. Reduction provided enantioenriched tetrahydroquinolines, whereas acid&#8208;promoted removal of Boc led to quinolines, and this was applied to a synthesis of the antimalarial compound M5717.

         <title>Efficient and Low&#8208;Impact Acetalization Reactions in Deep Eutectic Solvents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 36, June 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural deep eutectic solvents promote low&#8208;impact acetalization reactions on a wide range of substrates. The reaction medium is fully recycled without weakening of the catalytic activity up to ten times.







Abstract
The synthesis of acetals in acidic natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES), in which the solvent itself participates in the catalytic promotion of the reaction, is reported herein. The reaction is performed under feasible conditions, open air, without the need of external additives, catalysts or water&#8208;removing techniques, and it is wide in scope. The products are easily recovered, and the reaction medium is fully recycled and reused without weakening of its catalytic activity after 10&#8197;times. Remarkably, the entire process has been realized on gram scale.

         <title>Organoiridium Complexes Enhance Cellular Defense Against Reactive Aldehydes Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 36, June 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactive aldehyde species (RASP) have been implicated in numerous diseases due to their ability to alkylate or crosslink biomolecules. In this work, it was demonstrated that iridium small&#8208;molecule intracellular metal catalysts protect cells from RASP&#8208;induced cell death with greater efficiency than conventional aldehyde scavengers. A catalyst&#8208;based detoxification strategy could offer unique benefits over those relying on stoichiometric reactants.







Abstract
Although reactive aldehyde species (RASP) are associated with the pathogenesis of many major diseases, there are currently no clinically approved treatments for RASP overload. Conventional aldehyde detox agents are stoichiometric reactants that get consumed upon reacting with their biological targets, which limits their therapeutic efficiency. To achieve longer&#8208;lasting detoxification effects, small&#8208;molecule intracellular metal catalysts (SIMCats) were used to protect cells by converting RASP into non&#8208;toxic alcohols. It was shown that SIMCats were significantly more effective in lowering cell death from the treatment with 4&#8208;hydroxynon&#8208;2&#8208;enal than aldehyde scavengers over a 72&#8197;h period. Studies revealed that SIMCats reduced the aldehyde accumulation in cells exposed to the known RASP inducer arsenic trioxide. This work demonstrates that SIMCats offer unique benefits over stochiometric agents, potentially providing new ways to combat diseases with greater selectivity and efficiency than existing approaches.

         <title>A Brick&#8208;Wall Topological 2D Covalent Organic Framework Constructed from an H&#8208;Shaped &#8220;Two&#8208;in&#8208;One&#8221; Monomer</title>

A rare brick&#8208;wall topological imine COF (H&#8208;Blm&#8208;COF) was prepared by self&#8208;condensation of an H&#8208;shaped &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; monomer, which displayed excellent rejection efficiency towards ionic dyes.







Abstract
As an emerging class of porous crystalline material, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have received considerable research interests in terms of exploring new architectures and functions. Herein, we developed an unprecedented &#8220;H&#8208;shaped&#8221; monomer, upon self&#8208;polycondensation, which facilely produced a benzoimidazole&#8208;based COF (H&#8208;BIm&#8208;COF) with a rarely reported brick&#8208;wall topology. H&#8208;BIm&#8208;COF displayed high crystallinity, nano&#8208;sized porosity, and high thermal and chemical stabilities. Interestingly, H&#8208;BIm&#8208;COF based membranes showed selective permeability towards different solvents, which related to the size and polarity of the guest molecule. Additionally, initial study suggested the COF displayed excellent rejection efficiency towards ionic dyes, for example chromium black T (99.7&#8201;%) and rhodamine B (97.3&#8201;%). This work provides insights into developing new topological COFs by designing monomers with new configurations.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an emerging class of porous crystalline material, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have received considerable research interests in terms of exploring new architectures and functions. Herein, we developed an unprecedented &#8220;H-shaped&#8221; monomer, upon self-polycondensation, which facilely produced a benzoimidazole-based COF (H-BIm-COF) with a rarely reported brick-wall topology. H-BIm-COF displayed high crystallinity, nano-sized porosity, and high thermal and chemical stabilities. Interestingly, H-BIm-COF based membranes showed selective permeability towards different solvents, which related to the size and polarity of the guest molecule. Additionally, initial study suggested the COF displayed excellent rejection efficiency towards ionic dyes, for example chromium black T (99.7&#8201;%) and rhodamine B (97.3&#8201;%). This work provides insights into developing new topological COFs by designing monomers with new configurations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulating the Shape of Short Metal&#8208;Mediated Heteroleptic Tapes of Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 36, June 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
As in a chemical conveyor belt, our stepwise synthetic approach afforded the four novel and robust metal&#8208;mediated heteroleptic 4+3 porphyrin tapes D4&#8722;T4&#8722;D4, D3&#8722;T4&#8722;D3, D4&#8722;T3&#8722;D4, and D3&#8722;T3&#8722;D3, where a central meso&#8208;tetrapyridylporphyrin (either 3&#8242;&#8208;TPyP=T3, or 4&#8242;&#8208;TPyP=T4) is connected to two equal cis&#8208;dipyridylporphyrins (either 3&#8242;cisDPyMP=D3, or 4&#8242;cisDPyMP=D4) through four highly symmetrical {t,c,c&#8208;RuCl2(CO)2} (Ru) fragments.







Abstract
In view of developing artificial light&#8208;responsive complex systems, the preparation of discrete and robust heteroleptic assemblies of different chromophores in precisely defined positions is of great value since they would allow to investigate directional processes unavailable in symmetrical architectures. Here we describe the preparation, through a modular stepwise approach, and characterization of four novel and robust metal&#8208;mediated heteroleptic 4+3 porphyrin tapes, labeled D4&#8722;T4&#8722;D4, D3&#8722;T4&#8722;D3, D4&#8722;T3&#8722;D4, and D3&#8722;T3&#8722;D3, where a central meso&#8208;tetrapyridylporphyrin (either 3&#8242;&#8208;TPyP=T3 or 4&#8242;&#8208;TPyP=T4) is connected to two equal cis&#8208;dipyridylporphyrins (either 3&#8242;cisDPyMP=D3 or 4&#8242;cisDPyMP=D4) through four {t,c,c&#8208;RuCl2(CO)2} fragments. Whereas D4&#8722;T4&#8722;D4 is flat, the tapes containing at least one 3&#8242;PyP, i.&#8201;e. D3&#8722;T4&#8722;D3, D4&#8722;T3&#8722;D4, and D3&#8722;T3&#8722;D3, have unprecedented &#8211; and well defined &#8211; 3D geometries, and each exists in solution as a pair of stereoisomers in slow conformational equilibrium. The X&#8208;ray molecular structures of two such conformers, the C&#8208;shaped (D3&#8722;T4&#8722;D3)C and the z&#8208;shaped (D4&#8722;T3&#8722;D4)z, were determined and are fully consistent with the solution NMR findings.

Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) utilizing environmentally friendly vehicles such as a simple base, molecular oxygen, and green solvent are demonstrated.







Abstract
An environmentally friendly oxidation system has proposed for the practical and scalable production of value&#8208;added 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid from 1&#8197;kg of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural. The system is composed of a simple base, oxygen, and a green solvent, thereby providing a sustainable and economical approach to organic synthesis. To gain insight into the mechanism of this oxidation process, NMR spectroscopic analysis and kinetic study are used for the mechanistic investigation of this environmentally friendly oxidation process.

A new rhenanaphthalene isomer was isolated from the reaction of ReH5(PMe2Ph)3 with o&#8208;ethynylphenyl alkyne in the presence of excess HCl. Its formation may involve two protonation reactions and two migration reactions.







Abstract
Exploration of organometallic metallacycles has led to the development of various polycyclic compounds with fascinating structures, which could be used as functional materials. In this work, a new rhenanaphthalene isomer was isolated from the reaction of ReH5(PMe2Ph)3 with o&#8208;ethynylphenyl alkyne in the presence of excess HCl. Its structure was then identified using the single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy. DFT studies suggest that its formation involves two protonation reactions and two migration reactions. This new rhenanaphthalene isomer enriches the family of metallacycles.

Divalent lanthanoid pseudo&#8208;Grignard reagents PhLnBr (Ln=Sm, Eu and Yb) can be easily prepared by the oxidative addition of bromobenzene (PhBr) to lanthanoid metals in tetrahydrofuran. PhLnBr reacts with bulky N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;di&#8208;isopropylphenyl)formamidine (DippFormH) to generate LnII complexes, of the type [Ln(DippForm)Br(thf)n]2 (Ln=Sm, Eu, Yb).







Abstract
Divalent lanthanoid pseudo&#8208;Grignard reagents PhLnBr (Ln=Sm, Eu and Yb) can be easily prepared by the oxidative addition of bromobenzene (PhBr) to lanthanoid metals in tetrahydrofuran (THF). PhLnBr reacts with bulky N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;di&#8208;isopropylphenyl)formamidine (DippFormH) to generate LnII complexes, namely [Ln(DippForm)Br(thf)3]2&#8901;6thf (1; Sm, 2; Eu), and [Yb(DippForm)Br(thf)2]2&#8901;2thf (3; Yb). Samarium and europium (in 1 and 2) are seven coordinate, whereas ytterbium (in 3) is six coordinate, and all are bromine&#8208;bridged dimers. When PhLnBr reacts with 3,5&#8208;diphenylpyrazole (Ph2pzH), both divalent (5; [Eu(Ph2pz)2(thf)4]) and trivalent (4&#8201;a; [Sm(Ph2pz)3(thf)3]&#8901;3thf, 4&#8201;b; [Sm(Ph2pz)3(dme)2]&#8901;dme) complexes are obtained. In the monomeric compounds 4(a,b), samarium is nine coordinate but europium is eight coordinate in 5. The use of PhLnBr in this work transforms the outcomes from earlier reactions of PhLnI.

         <title>Electroreductive Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling of Aziridines and Aryl Bromides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 36, June 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and efficient method for the electroreductive cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of aziridines with aryl bromides has been developed to access the desired &#946;&#8208;arylethylamine derivatives and beyond. This method exhibited a broad substrate scope, and proved to be a powerful approach to the late&#8208;stage cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of natural product and drug derivatives.







Abstract
Herein, a nickela&#8208;electrocatalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of readily available aryl aziridines and aryl bromides under mild and sustainable electrochemical conditions to access synthetic useful &#946;&#8208;arylethylamines is developed. This protocol is characterized by its exquisite chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity, broad substrate scope and good functional group compatibility. Mechanistic studies confirmed that the regioselectivity and reactivity observed are a result of electro&#8208;induced ring&#8208;opening of aziridines under electroreductive conditions to generate a benzyl radical intermediate as the active species. Furthermore, this strategy also enables cross&#8208;coupling with CO2 to access &#946;&#8208;amino acids under mild conditions.

         <title>Sunlight Induced and Alternative Sc(OTf)3 Catalyzed Remote C&#8722;H Halogenation of Indoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 36, June 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The remote C5&#8208;H halogenation has been achieved ether by natural light or catalytic Sc(OTf)3 under mild condition. Moreover, the cascade C6&#8208;H bromination and benzylic C&#8722;H oxidation under photocatalytic conditions was also discussed.







Abstract
A mild and catalyst&#8208;free sunlight induced protocol for the remote meta bromination of electron&#8208;deficient indoles is described for the first time. Herein, N&#8208;bromosaccharin is activated by sunlight irradiation. Alternately, a synergistic activation model (Sc(OTf)3/HFIP) has also been developed for the activation of haloniums, complementary to the light induced strategy. In addition, the cascade C6&#8208;H bromination and benzylic C&#8722;H oxidation under photocatalytic conditions was also discussed. High regio&#8208;and chem&#8208;selectivity, mild reaction conditions, and scalability demonstrate great potential of the developed methods in practical applications and further functionalization.

         <title>Dichotomy of Delocalization/Localization and Charge&#8208;Shift Bonding in Germanazene and its Heavier Group 14 Analogues: a Valence Bond Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 36, June 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A valence bond study is carried out to explore the structure, bonding, and &#960;&#8208;delocalization in the E3(NH)3 (E=Ge, C, Si, Sn, Pb) rings. Our findings indicate that a nonbonded structure, wherein the &#960;&#8208;electron density is localized on each N atom, dominates the ground states of these molecules, and the natures of the E&#8722;N bonds as charge&#8208;shift types.







Abstract
We present here a valence bond analysis of structure and &#960;&#8208;delocalization in Ge3(NH)3, which models germanazene that was prepared by Power et&#8197;al. To get a broader perspective, we explore the entire E3(NH)3 series (E=C, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb). Thus, while (4n+2)&#960; systems of carbon rings are aromatic with cyclic &#960;&#8208;delocalization, the E3(NH)3 rings are dominated by a nonbonded structure, wherein &#960;&#8208;lone pairs are localized on the N atoms. Nevertheless, these molecules enjoy large covalent&#8208;ionic resonance energies of 153.0, 86.6, 74.2, 61.2, and 58.9&#8197;kcal/mol, respectively, for E=C, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb. The covalent&#8208;ionic mixing in E3(NH)3 creates &#960;&#8208;systems, which are stabilized by charge&#8208;shift bonding. Thus, unlike in benzene, in Ge3(NH)3 delocalization of &#960;&#8208;electron pairs of the N atoms is primarily confined to the domains of their adjacent Ge atoms. These features carry over to the substituted germanazene, Ge3(NAr)3 (Ar=Ph).

         <title>Enantioselective Sequential Catalytic Arylation&#8208;Fukuyama Cross&#8208;coupling of 1,1&#8208;Biszincioalkane Linchpins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 36, June 27, 2023. </description>

A one pot double cross&#8208;coupling sequence employing gem C(sp3)&#8208;organodizinc dinucleophiles is achieved for the first time with high enantioselectivity through an original strategy relying on the combination of a first non&#8208;stereoselective desymmetrization reaction delivering a racemic stereolabile mono&#8208;organozinc intermediate that undergoes subsequent catalytic deracemization. A modular entry to enantioenriched 1&#8208;arylalkyl ketones is developed.







Abstract
1,1&#8208;Bis(iodozincio)alkanes are used as dinucleophilic linchpins in an enantioselective double cross&#8208;coupling reaction sequence involving aryl iodides and then thioesters. The two catalytic C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming reactions are achieved in the same pot through two distinct palladium&#8208;based catalytic systems: a first non&#8208;enantioselective one delivering configurationally labile secondary benzylzinc species from an achiral precursor, and a second enantioconvergent one that operates a highly efficient dynamic kinetic resolution of the racemic intermediates. This strategy, new in the area of asymmetric synthesis through two consecutive electrophilic substitution reactions of geminated C(sp3)&#8208;organodimetallics, provides useful methodology to access in a modular fashion acyclic &#945;&#8208;disubstituted ketone products with very high enantiomeric purity.

         <title>Vanol&#8208;Supported Lanthanide Complexes for Strong Circularly Polarized Luminescence at 1550&#8197;nm</title>

Highest Er glum reported: Strong circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in the telecom C&#8208;band is reported for Vanol&#8208;supported erbium complexes. A structure&#8208;CPL activity relationship study provides guidance towards the generation of even better near&#8208;infrared CPL emitters.







Abstract
Strong circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) at 1550&#8197;nm is reported for lanthanide complexes supported by Vanol; these are the first examples of coordination of Vanol to lanthanides. A change in the ligand design from a 1,1&#8217;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (in Binol) to a 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bi&#8208;1&#8208;naphthol (in Vanol) results in significantly improved dissymmetry factors for (Vanol)3ErNa3 (|glum|=0.64) at 1550&#8197;nm. This is among the highest reported dissymmetry factors to date in the telecom C&#8208;band region, and among the highest for any lanthanide complexes. Comparative solid&#8208;state structural analysis of (Vanol)3ErNa3 and (Binol)3ErNa3 suggests that a less distorted geometry around the metal center is in part responsible for the high chiroptical metrics of (Vanol)3ErNa3. This phenomenon was further evidenced in the analogous ytterbium complex (Vanol)3YbNa3 that also exhibit a significantly improved dissymmetry factor (|glum|=0.21). This confirms and generalizes the same observation that was made in other visibly emitting, six&#8208;coordinate lanthanide complexes. Due to their strong CPL at 1550&#8197;nm, the reported complexes are potential candidates for applications in quantum communication technologies. More importantly, our structure&#8208;CPL activity relationship study provides guidance towards the generation of even better near&#8208;infrared CPL emitters.

         <title>Optimization and Automation of Helical Aromatic Oligoamide Foldamer Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 36, June 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
On&#8208;resin folding during solid&#8208;phase synthesis is not always an impediment! Under optimized conditions, helices of aromatic oligoamide foldamers are produced in high yield even when their length reaches tens of units. Automation of synthesis on a commercial peptide synthesizer is a game changer for the development of these compounds.







Abstract
Helically folded oligoamides of 8&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;quinolinecarboxylic acid composed of up to 41&#8197;units were prepared using optimized manual solid&#8208;phase synthesis (SPS). The high yield and purity of the final products places these SPS protocols among the most efficient known to date. Furthermore, analytical methods allowing for the clear identification and purity assessment of the products were validated, including 1H&#8197;NMR, a seldom used method for such large molecules. Adaption of the SPS protocols, in particular using in&#8197;situ acid chloride activation under Appel's conditions, made it possible to efficiently implement SPS on a commercial peptide synthesizer, leading to a dramatic reduction of the laboratory work required to produce long sequences. Automation constitutes a breakthrough for the development of helical aromatic oligoamide foldamers.

         <title>Tuning the Photophysical Properties and Photostability of Bis(naphthobipyrrolylmethene) Derived BODIPY via Functionalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 36, June 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Five new BODIPY derivatives have been synthesized which show NIR absorption and emission with high molar absorption coefficient and high fluorescence quantum yield. Some of them exhibit excellent photostability.







Abstract
A series of NIR absorbing and emitting, naphthobipyrrole derived BODIPY dyes are reported. These dyes possess different functional groups viz. &#8722;CHO, &#8722;CN, &#8722;NO2, &#8208;Br and Ph at its &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;positions. All the derivatives were characterized thoroughly via various spectroscopic means as well as single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structural analyses. Impacts of functionalization on its photophysical properties as well as photostability were evaluated. For instance, incorporation of the phenyl moieties at the &#945;, &#945;&#8242;&#8208;positions by Suzuki coupling of the dibromo&#8208;derivative 4 with phenyl boronic acid led to substantial bathochromic shift in absorption (762 vs 727&#8197;nm) and emission (778 vs 744&#8197;nm) relative to the unsubstituted parent dye VI. Theoretical calculations have been performed by ground state optimization to evaluate the electronic transitions which supports experimental observation.

Singlet oxygen is generated by the BODIPY photosensitizer, whose X&#8208;ray structure is shown in the central part of the picture. The structures in the left and right corners of the doors are those of bis(benzothienylo)[1,4]thiaborins&#8212;basic building blocks of BODIPY. The sensitization process requires white light, which is symbolized by a light bulb. Triplet oxygen enters through the red door, where it is excited to the singlet state, and leaves through the blue door. More information can be found in the Research Article by P.&#8197;H.

         <title>Cover Feature: In Vitro Selection and Characterization of a DNAzyme Probe for Diverse Pathogenic Strains of Clostridium difficile (Chem. Eur. J. 36/2023)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 36, June 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An RNA&#8208;cleavage fluorogenic DNAzyme has been made for recognizing diverse strains of Clostridium difficile that frequently cause an infectious disease known as C.&#8197;difficile infection (CDI). Upon encountering C.&#8197;difficile cells, this DNAzyme cuts itself to produce a fluorescent signal, thus making it useful as a molecular probe for CDI diagnosis. This DNAzyme is highly specific as it stays silent in the presence of several control bacterial cells. The DNAzyme has an intriguing secondary structure with a pseudoknot arrangement that is essential for its functionality. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Li and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300240).

The sponge&#8208;derived, highly unsaturated marine macrolide (&#8722;)&#8208;zampanolide is a potent antimitotic agent and cancer cell growth inhibitor. By using a convergent synthetic approach, the shown series of partially reduced and/or demethylated analogs were obtained. Depending on the site of modification, these compounds show a range of microtubule&#8208;binding affinities and cellular activities, thus providing new insights into the relative importance of specific double bonds and methyl groups for biological activity. More information can be found in the Research Article by K.&#8208;H. Altmann and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300703).

         <title>The Uncertain Role of Nominations for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry&#8224;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 36, June 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Nobel Prize Nomination Archives provides the names of the nominators and their nominees for the chemistry prize from 1901 to 1970. This data gives insights into the selection of the Nobel Laureates. One of the more unusual observations is an up&#8208;down&#8208;up nomination trend for many of the chemistry laureates at the very end of their nomination profiles. Some chemistry laureates received very few nominations; and some non&#8208;laureates received many nominations. The nomination patterns are often curious and always informative.







Abstract
The solicitation of nominations for the Nobel Prizes in Chemistry (NPch) is and has been the first step in the selection process since the very first awards were made in 1901. The number of nominations solicited by and provided to the Nobel Committee for Chemistry supports the belief by the nominators that their nominations are meaningful. In this publication, we examine data culled from the Nobel Prize Nomination Archives for the period 1901&#8211;1970 of the variable role of nominations in the selection process for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The evidence is overwhelming that nominations, in general, during the 1901&#8211;1970 period have not been the deciding, overriding factor in the selection of the recipients of the NPch. Rather, we posit that nominations from the preselected nominator&#8208;pool have been a source of information for the Committee, used to suggest future years&#8217; contenders and possibly served as motivation for the Committee to seek nominations for specific nominees for future years. It is also clear that selections are often influenced by personal prejudices, for example, friendships, rivalries, and nationality.

         <title>Stability of Catalytic Centres in Light&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Evolution by Di&#8208; and Oligonuclear Photocatalysts</title>

Photocatalytic water reduction: This review is focused on the catalytically active metal centre for photocatalytic water reduction and summarizes the main decomposition pathways turning a molecular photocatalyst into a heterogeneous, colloid&#8208;based catalytic system. Moreover, strategies to obtain molecularly operating oligonuclear photocatalysts are presented.







Abstract
A review. In recent decades, mimicking natural photosynthesis by artificial photocatalysis represented a major research direction with the ultimate goal of reducing fossil fuel consumption through efficient solar energy harvesting. To transfer molecular photocatalysis from the lab scale to an industrially relevant process, it is important to overcome instability problems of the catalysts during light&#8208;driven operation. As it is well&#8208;known that many of the typically utilized noble metal&#8208;based catalytic centres (e.&#8201;g. Pt and Pd) undergo particle formation during (photo)catalysis and thus switch the whole process from a homogeneous into a heterogeneous one, an understanding of the factors governing particle formation is crucially needed. The review therefore focuses on di&#8208; and oligonuclear photocatalysts bearing a range of different bridging ligand architectures for drawing structure&#8208;catalyst&#8208;stability relationships in light&#8208;driven intramolecular reductive catalysis. In addition, ligand effects at the catalytic centre and their implications for catalytic activity in intermolecular systems will be discussed, as will important insights into the future design of operationally stable catalysts.

         <dc:description>
The simple class of dinuclear Mn(I) carbonyl compounds with phosphido (PR2&#8722;) and hydrido (H&#8722;) bridges has been known since the 1960&#8217;s. Only recently were they discovered to have potential catalytic applications. This Review is a fresh look the synthesis, reactivity, and catalysis of this interesting class of molecules.







Abstract
A class of organomanganese hydrogenation catalysts was recently rediscovered. These are simple dinuclear Mn(I) carbonyl compounds with phosphido (PR2&#8722;) and hydrido (H&#8722;) bridges. This class of compounds has been known since the 1960&#8217;s, and they have rich coordination chemistry and reactivity. Given their recently discovered potential for catalytic applications, a fresh look at this class of compounds was necessary. Hence, this Review comprehensively covers the synthesis, reactivity, and catalysis of this interesting class of molecules.

         <title>Organoselenium compounds. Chemistry and applications in organic synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selenium, originally described as a toxin, turns out to be a crucial trace element for life that appears as selenocysteine and its dimer, selenocystine. From the point of view of drug developments, selenium&#8208;containing drugs are isosteres of sulfur and oxygen with the advantage that the presence of the selenium atom confers antioxidant properties and high lipophilicity, which would increase cell membrane permeation leading to better oral bioavailability. In this article we have focused on the relevant features of the selenium atom, above all, the corresponding synthetic approaches to access a variety of organoselenium molecules along with the proposed reaction mechanisms. The preparation and biological properties of selenosugars, including selenoglycosides, selenonucleosides, selenopeptides, and other selenium&#8208;containing compounds will be treated. We have attempted to condense the most important aspects and interesting examples of the chemistry of selenium into a single article.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivity Differences of Trigonal Pyramidal Nonheme Iron(IV)&#8208;Oxo and Iron(III)&#8208;Oxo Complexes: Experiment and Theory</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combined experimental and computational studies show iron(III)&#8208;oxo complexes can abstract hydrogen atoms from toluene efficiently, but thermochemically fail to do OH rebound and as such tolyl radicals are released and react separately. As a consequence iron(IV)&#8208;oxo and iron(III)&#8208;oxo generate different products in a reaction with toluene.







Abstract
High&#8208;valent metal&#8208;oxo species play critical roles in enzymatic catalysis yet their properties are still poorly understood. In this work we report a combined experimental and computational study into biomimetic iron(IV)&#8208;oxo and iron(III)&#8208;oxo complexes with tight second&#8208;coordination sphere environments that restrict substrate access. The work shows that the second&#8208;coordination sphere slows the hydrogen atom abstraction step from toluene dramatically and the kinetics is zeroth order in substrate. However, the iron(II)&#8208;hydroxo that is formed has a low reduction potential and hence cannot do OH rebound favorably. The tolyl radical in solution then reacts further with alternative reaction partners. By contrast, the iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species reacts predominantly through OH rebound to form alcohol products. Our studies show that the oxidation state of the metal influences reactivities and selectivities with substrate dramatically and that enzymes will likely need an iron(IV) center to catalyze C&#8722;H hydroxylation reactions.

         <title>Strong and Tunable Near&#8208;Infrared Circular Dichroism in Helical Tetrapyrrole Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical metal complexes of tetraphenylbilatrienones (TPBT) have been selectively synthesized, and for the first time, their structure was revealed by XRD. Contrary to theoretical predictions, their 20&#8208;phenyl group points alongside the tetrapyrrole backbone, yielding a well&#8208;defined molecule with stable helicity, 800&#8197;nm ECD absorption and &#8211; if copper is coordinated &#8211; noninnocent properties.







Abstract
The selective synthesis of nickel and copper complexes of 19&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;5,10,15&#8208;triphenyl&#8208;bilatrien&#8208;1&#8208;one (H2TPBT) is reported, a molecule which crystallizes as a molecular helix of one&#8208;and&#8208;a&#8208;quarter which turns with a 5.7&#8197;&#197; radius and a 3.2&#8197;&#197; pitch, and all 26 participating atoms are sp2&#8208;hybridized. UV/vis, ECD, ESR and cyclic voltammetry experiments reveal a strong interaction between metal and ligand and partial radical character when copper is coordinated instead of nickel. Strong ECD absorption in the 800&#8197;nm range is found which, using TD&#8208;DFT calculations as well as literature spectra, is shown to be highly tunable both by metal coordination and variation of the aryl groups in the TPBT periphery. The radical character of the ligand in Cu(TPBT) enables rapid interconversion between (M)&#8208; and (P)&#8208;enantiomers, possibly via intermittent breakage of a Cu&#8722;N bond. The 19&#8208;benzoyl group kinetically stabilizes enantiopure (M/P)&#8208;Ni(TPBT). The results are interpreted with regard to the application as circularly polarized light (CPL) detectors as well as to the chirality&#8208;induced spin&#8208;selectivity (CISS) effect which is currently lacking a concise theoretical model.

         <title>EnT&#8208;Mediated Amino&#8208;Sulfonylation of Alkenes with Bifunctional Sulfonamides: Access to &#946;&#8208;Amino Sulfone Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A benign method was developed for the economical and sustainable amino&#8208;sulfonylation of alkenes with high regioselectivity and diastereoselectivity. This approach showed high functional group tolerance and compatibility, facilitating the late&#8208;stage modification of some bioactive alkenes and sulfonamide molecules, thereby expanding the biologically relevant chemical space. Mechanistic investigations suggest that an energy transfer (EnT) process was in operation.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Amino sulfones are commonly found structural motifs in biologically active compounds. Herein, we report a direct photocatalyzed amino&#8208;sulfonylation reaction of alkenes for the efficicient production of important compounds by simple hydrolysis without the need for additional oxidants and reductants. In this transformation, the sulfonamides worked as bifunctional reagents, simultaneously generating sulfonyl radicals and N&#8208;centered radicals which were added to alkene in a highly atom&#8208;economical fashion with high regioselectivity and diastereoselectivity. This approach showed high functional group tolerance and compatibility, facilitating the late&#8208;stage modification of some bioactive alkenes and sulfonamide molecules, thereby expanding the biologically relevant chemical space. Scaling up this reaction led to an efficient green synthesis of apremilast, one of the best&#8208;selling pharmceuticals, demonstrating the synthetic utility of the applied method. Moreover, mechanistic investigations suggest that an energy transfer (EnT) process was in operation.

         <title>Smart Temperature&#8208;Gating and Ion Conductivity Control of Grafted Anodic Aluminum Oxide Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Progress in solid&#8208;state nanochannels development: A thermo&#8208;responsive polymer poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) brushes grafted anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) membrane by surface&#8208;initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI&#8208;ATRP) is presented. This thermo&#8208;gated smart membrane shows a reversible surface wettability change, which allows the smart membrane to control the ion conductivity and ensures the dye release ability.







Abstract
Over the past few decades, stimuli&#8208;responsive materials have been widely applied to porous surfaces. Permeability and conductivity control of ions confined in nanochannels modified with stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, however, have been less investigated. In this work, the permeability and conductivity control of ions confined in nanochannels of anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) templates modified with thermo&#8208;responsive poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) brushes are demonstrated. By surface&#8208;initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI&#8208;ATRP), PNIPAM brushes are successfully grafted onto the hexagonally packed cylindrical nanopores of AAO templates. The surface hydrophilicities of the membranes can be reversibly altered because of the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior of the PNIPAM polymer brushes. From electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis, the temperature&#8208;gating behaviors of the AAO&#8208;g&#8208;PNIPAM membranes exhibit larger impedance changes than those of the pure AAO membranes at higher temperatures because of the aggregation of the grafted PNIPAM chains. The reversible surface properties caused by the extended and collapsed states of the polymer chains are also demonstrated by dye release tests. The smart thermo&#8208;gated and ion&#8208;controlled nanoporous membranes are suitable for future smart membrane applications.

         <title>Ru(II) Complexes with Protic&#8208; and Anionic&#8208;Naked&#8208;NHC Ligands for Cooperative Activation of Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A set of ruthenium(II)&#8208;protic&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complexes, [Ru(NNCH)(PPh3)2(X)]Cl (1, X=Cl and 2, X=H) and their deprotonated forms [Ru(NNC)(PPh3)2(X)] (1&#697;, X=Cl and 2&#697;, X=H) are reported where NNC is a new unsymmetrical pincer ligand. The four complexes are interconvertible by simple acid&#8208;base chemistry. The combined theoretical and spectroscopic investigations indicate charge segregation in anionic&#8208;NHC complexes (1&#697; and 2&#697;) and can be described from a Lewis pair perspective. The chemical reactivity of deprotonated complex 1&#697; shows cooperative small molecule activation. Complex 1&#697; activates H&#8208;H bond of hydrogen, C(sp3)&#8208;I bond of iodomethane, and C(sp)&#8208;H bond of phenylacetylene. The activation of CO2 using anionic NHC complex 1&#697; at moderate temperature and ambient pressure and subsequent conversion to formate is also described. All the new compounds have been characterized using ESI&#8208;MS, 1H, 13C, and 31P NMR spectroscopy. Molecular structures of 1, 2, and 2&#697; have also been determined with single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The cooperative small molecule activation perspective broadens the scope of potential applications of anionic&#8208;NHC complexes in small molecule activation, including the conversion of carbon dioxide to formate, a much sought after reaction in the renewable energy and sustainable development domains.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalently modified Kevlar fabric incorporating graphene oxide with enhanced antibacterial properties and preserved strength</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work describes a multi&#8208;step modification process for the covalent transformation of Kevlar fabric en route the incorporation of graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets. Spectroscopic, thermal and microscopy imgaing techniques have been employed to follow step&#8208;by&#8208;step the modification of Kevlar and the formation of the corresponding Kevlar&#8208;GO hybrid fabric. The level of Kevlar&#8217;s functionalization can be controled with the nitration time, the first reaction&#160;in the multi&#8208;sequence organic transformations, for obtaining the hybrid fabric&#160;with a content of GO up to 30%. Most importantly, the covalent post&#8208;modification of Kevlar does not occur in the expense of the other otherwise excellent mechanical properties of the fabric. Under optimal conditions, the&#160;&#160;Kevlar&#8208;GO hybrid fabric shows a 20% enhancement of the ultimate strengh. Notably, when the Kevlar&#8208;GO hybrid fabric exposed to cyanobacterial&#160;Synechococcus&#160;the bacteria growth was fully inhibited. Overall, the covalently modified fabric demonstrated significant antibacterial behavior, excellent strength and stability under common processes. Due to its simplicity, the methodology presented in this work not only promises to result in a standard procedure to functionalize the&#160;mer&#160;units of Kevlar with&#160;&#160;a variety of chemicals and nanomaterials but it can be also extended for the modification and hybridization of other fabrics.</dc:description>

         <title>Re&#8208;thinking Dimer Design Principles with Indolonaphthyridine Intramolecular Singlet Fission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Singlet fission is a phenomenon that could significantly improve the efficiency of photovoltaic devices. Indolonaphthyridine thiophene (INDT) is a photostable singlet fission material that could potentially be utilised in singlet fission&#8208;based photovoltaic devices. Here, we investigate the intramolecular singlet fission (i&#8208;SF) mechanism of INDT dimers linked via para&#8208;phenyl, meta&#8208;phenyl and fluorene bridging groups. Using ultra&#8208;fast spectroscopy we find the highest rate of singlet fission in the para&#8208;phenyl linked dimer. Quantum calculations show the para&#8208;phenyl linker encourages enhanced monomer electronic coupling. Increased rates of singlet fission were also observed in the higher polarity o&#8208;dichlorobenzene, relative to toluene, indicating that charge&#8208;transfer states have a role in mediating the process. We find the mechanistic picture of polarisable singlet fission materials, such as INDT, extends beyond the traditional mechanistic landscape.</dc:description>

         <title>Naphthalimide&#8208;Dyes Bearing Phosphine and Phosphorylamide Moieties: Synthesis and Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,8&#8208;naphthalimides (NIs) represent a class of organic dyes with interesting optical properties that has been extensively explored in the last decades in lighting devices, chemosensors, optical probes or medicinal chemistry. However, despite their remarkable potential, reports on organometallic dyes bearing NIs are scarce and virtually inexistent regarding palladium(II) complexes. Herein, we report the synthesis of NIs bearing phosphine and amine chelating moieties and the characterization of their optical properties both as single molecules and when complexed on Pd(II) ions. It is shown that the introduction of phosphine moieties in the naphthalimide core results in a marked increase in non&#8208;radiative processes, leading to a significant reduction of the emission efficiency and lifetime of these dyes, compared to amine&#8208;bearing counterparts. The complexation to Pd(II) sequesters the electronic contribution of chelating moieties, with complexes assuming an optical behavior similar to that of unsubstituted 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide. The complexation significantly increases the acidity of chelating secondary amines, giving rise to an unexpected intramolecular reaction that results in the formation of a novel 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide dye bearing a cyclic phosphorylamide moiety. The new dye exhibits good emission quantum yield, long fluorescence lifetime and sensitivity to basic media, evidencing potential for application in optical imaging and sensing scenarios.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Chiral 2&#8208;Nitroallylic Amines via Cooperative Cation&#8208;Binding Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral allylic amines are valuable building blocks for biologically important compounds and natural products. In this study, we present the use of cooperative cation&#8208;binding catalysis as an efficient method for synthesizing chiral allylic amines. By utilizing a chiral oligoEG and potassium fluoride as a cation&#8208;binding catalyst and base, respectively, a wide range of biologically relevant chiral 2&#8208;nitroallylic amines are obtained with excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt; 99% ee) through the organocatalytic asymmetric aza&#8208;Henry&#8208;like reaction of &#946;&#8208;monosubstituted and &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted nitroalkenes with &#945;&#8208;amidosulfones as imine precursors. Extensive experimental studies are presented to illustrate plausible mechanisms. Preliminary use of a chiral 2&#8208;nitroallylic amine as a Michael acceptor demonstrated its potential application for diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of bioactive compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Diversified Penta&#8208;spiro&#8208;heterocyclic and Fused&#8208;heterocyclic Frameworks with Potent Antitumor Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple&#8208;spiro/fused&#8208;heterocyclic frameworks containing indazolone are structurally unique and represent a class of potentially dominant skeletons. In this work, we successfully fulfilled Rh(III)&#8208;catalyst mediated substrate&#8208; and pH&#8208; controlled strategies to construct four novel types of complicated penta&#8208;spiro/fused&#8208;heterocyclic frameworks via C&#8208;H activation/[4+1] and [4+2] annulation cascades. This method had mild reaction conditions, a broad scope of substrates, moderate to good yields, and valuable applications, which could realize for the first time the generation of the novel di&#8208;spiro&#8208;heterocyclic and multiple fused&#8208;heterocyclic products with unique structures. More importantly, novel spiro[cyclohexane&#8208;indazolo[1,2&#8208;a]indazole] scaffold constructed by this method exhibited potent antitumor activity against a variety of refractory solid tumors and hematological malignancies in vitro. Overall, our work provided new insights into the construction of complex and diverse multiple spiro/fused&#8208;heterocyclic systems and offered novel valuable lead compounds for the discovery of antitumor drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactions of Tetra(o&#8208;tolyl)diborane(4) with Organic Azides: Formation of Fluorescent Boron&#8208;Fused Hexazenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of tetra(o&#8208;tolyl)diborane(4) with organic azides afforded three different compounds, diborylamines, diboryltriazenes, and B2&#8208;hexazenes having a bicyclic B2N6 ring system. The reaction with aryl azides gave diborylamines, while the reaction with 1 equiv. of alkyl azides furnished diboryltriazenes. In the case of the reaction with an excess amount of 1&#176; alkyl azide, a new heterocyclic B2&#8208;hexazenes were obtained. The formation of the B2N6 structure could be explained by one general reaction mechanism via the diboryltriazene intermediate according to the control experiments and DFT calculations. The B2&#8208;hexazenes exhibited a strong fluorescence with a remarkably high fluorescent quantum yield of up to 96%.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;site Metal Catalysts for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical catalytic CO2 reduction (CO2RR) is a promising and green approach for reducing atmospheric CO2 concentration and achieving high&#8208;value conversion of CO2 under the carbon&#8208;neutral policy. In CO2RR, the dual&#8208;site metal catalysts (DSMCs) have received wide attention for their ingenious design strategies, abundant active sites, and excellent catalytic performance attributed to the synergistic effect between dual&#8208;site in terms of activity, selectivity and stability, which plays a key role in catalytic reactions. This review provides a systematic summary and detailed classification of DSMCs for CO2RR, describes the mechanism of synergistic effects in catalytic reactions, and also introduces in situ characterization techniques commonly used in CO2RR. Finally, the main challenges and prospects of dual&#8208;site catalysts and even multi&#8208;site catalysts for CO2 recycling are analyzed. It is believed that based on the understanding of bimetallic site catalysts and synergistic effects in CO2RR, well&#8208;designed high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts are promising for achieving CO2 conversion, electrochemical energy conversion and storage in the future.</dc:description>

The scaffold was first converted into a meridional Au,N,N&#8208;tridentate ligand through binding of a Au(I)Cl moiety at the carbene center.

         <title>Cyclization, Decyclization, and Metallacyclization of Pyridine&#8208;Substituted Homopropargylic Alcohols on Ruthenium(II) and Osmium(II) Centers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental and theoretical investigations on the reactions between cis&#8208;[Ru/Os(dppm)2Cl2] and pyridine/quinoline&#8208;substituted homopropargylic alcohols provided strategies to prepare new metalated heterocyclic and metalacyclic complexes by utilizing temperature&#8208;controlled divergent pathways and an unexpected decyclization mechanism. Cyclization, decyclization, and metallacyclization of pyridine&#8208;substituted homopropargylic alcohols on ruthenium(II) and osmium(II) centers (C.&#8197;Y. Wong et&#8197;al.)







Abstract
Systematic investigations on the reactions between cis&#8208;[M(dppm)2Cl2] (M=Ru/Os; dppm=1,1&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)methane) and pyridine/quinoline substituted homopropargylic alcohols uncovered the diverse Ru(II)/Os(II)&#8208;induced alkyne activation pathways. The alkynes underwent cyclization on M via a &#8220;non&#8208;vinylidene&#8221; pathway at lower temperatures, resulting in alkenyl intermediates which might further metallacyclize to give metallapyrroloindolizines. Conversely, reactions at higher temperatures induced alkyne cyclization on M via a &#8220;vinylidene&#8221; pathway, affording cyclic oxacarbene complexes. Additionally, a rare decyclization mechanism was observed during the transformation of a metallacyclization&#8208;resistant alkenyl complex into a cyclic oxacarbene complex. DFT calculations were employed to validate the experimental findings. Overall, these results not only provide insights into controlling alkyne activation pathways, but also offer new strategies for preparing metalated heterocyclic and metallacyclic complexes.

         <title>The First Cu(I)&#8208;Peptoid Complex: Enabling Metal Ion Stability and Selectivity via Backbone Helicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Cu(I)&#8208;peptoid complex is presented here. This complex is based on a helical peptoid incorporating 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (Bipy) ligands pre&#8208;organized on the same side of the helix. Interplay between the first and second coordination spheres is demonstrated, where the first coordination sphere is provided by the two Bipy ligands and the second by the helical structure, enabling the high stability of Cu(I).







Abstract
Stabilization of Cu(I) is ubiquitous within native copper proteins. Understanding how to stabilize Cu(I) within synthetic biomimetic systems is therefore desired towards biological applications. Peptoids are an important class of peptodomimetics, that can bind metal ions and stabilize them in their high oxidation state. Thus, to date, they were not used for Cu(I) binding. Here we show how the helical peptoid hexamer, having two 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (Bipy) groups that face the same side of the helix, forms the intramolecular air stable Cu(I) complex. Further study of the binding site by rigorous spectroscopic techniques suggests that Cu(I) is tetracoordinated, binding to only three N atoms from the Bipy ligands and to the N&#8208;terminus of the peptoid's backbone. A set of control peptoids and experiments indicates that the Cu(I) stability and selectivity are dictated by the intramolecular binding, forced by the helicity of the peptoid, which can be defined as the second coordination sphere of the metal center.

         <title>Structural Conversion of Supramolecular Assembly in Solution by Thermally Induced Intramolecular Electron Transfer of [Co2Fe2] Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural conversion of a supramolecular assembly was controlled by the thermally induced electron transfer&#8208;coupled spin transition (ETCST) of a [Co2Fe2] complex. The complex with an amphiphilic anion formed reverse vesicles in solution. The thermal ETCST of the complex in the presence of a dicarboxylic acid changed the structure from the reverse vesicle to entangled one&#8208;dimensional chains through the formation of hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
Combining metal complexes with amphiphilic molecules leads to a wide variety of functional self&#8208;assembled nanostructures. Metal complexes exhibiting spin transitions can be good candidates as the trigger to cause structural conversion of such assembly because they respond to various external stimuli. In this work, we studied a structural conversion of a supramolecular assembly containing a [Co2Fe2] complex through a thermally induced electron transfer&#8208;coupled spin transition (ETCST). With an amphiphilic anion, the [Co2Fe2] complex formed reverse vesicles in solution and showed thermal ETCST. In contrast, thermal ETCST in the presence of a bridging hydrogen&#8208;bond donor caused structural conversion from the reverse vesicle structure to entangled one&#8208;dimensional chains through hydrogen bond formation.

         <title>Strong Chiroptical Effects in the Absorption and Emission of Macrocycles Based on the 2,5&#8208;Diaminoterephthalate Minimal Fluorophore</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple one&#8208;pot reaction produces chiral macrocycles consisting of repeatable units of dimethyl 2,5&#8208;diaminoterephthalate (n=2&#8211;4). The products fluoresce in solution and the solid state at wavelengths that are dependent on the size of the macrocyclic ring. ECD and CPL spectra reveal high chiroptical activity in the red range, despite their small chromophores.







Abstract
Chiral fluorescent macrocycles consisting of two to four units of dimethyl 2,5&#8208;diaminoterephthalate can be readily synthesized in a one&#8208;pot manner from inexpensive building blocks. Depending on the concentration, either a paracyclophane&#8208;like dimer with closely stacked benzene rings or a triangular trimer is the main product of the reaction. The macrocycles exhibit fluorescence in solution as well as in the solid state with maxima that are red&#8208;shifted with decreasing size of the macrocyclic ring and are observed at wavelengths from 590 (tetramer in solution) to 700&#8197;nm (dimer in the solid state). Chirality dictates the differential absorption and emission of circularly polarized light by these molecules. The ECD and CPL effects are particularly strong for the trimer, which is characterized by relatively large dissymmetry factors gabs=&#177;2.8&#215;10&#8722;3 at 531&#8197;nm and glum=&#177;2.3&#215;10&#8722;3 at 580&#8197;nm in n&#8208;hexane, being at the same time highly luminescent (&#934;fl=13.7&#8201;%). Despite the small chromophore, the circularly polarized brightness BCPL of 2.3&#8197;dm3&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 is comparable to values reported for other classes of established CPL emitters in the visible region, such as expanded helicenes or larger &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems.

         <dc:description>Graphene oxide (GO) is a 2D nanomaterial with unique chemistry due to the combination of sp2 hybridization and oxygen functional groups (OFGs) even in single layer. OFGs play a fundamental role in the chemical functionalization of GO to produce GO&#8208;based materials for diverse applications. However, traditional strategies that employ epoxides, alcohols, and carboxylic acids suffer of low control and undesirable side reactions, including by&#8208;product formation and GO reduction. Thiol&#8208;ene "click" reaction offers a promising and versatile chemical approach for the alkene functionalization (&#8208;C=C&#8208;) of GO, providing orthogonality, stereoselectivity, regioselectivity, and high yields while reducing by&#8208;products. This review examines the chemical functionalization of GO via thiol&#8208;ene "click" reactions, providing insights into the underlying reaction mechanisms, including the role of radical or base catalysts in triggering the reaction. We discuss the &#8220;how&#8221; and &#8220;where&#8221; the reaction takes place on GO, the strategies to avoid unwanted side reactions, such as GO reduction and by&#8208;product formation. We anticipate that multi&#8208;functionalization of GO via the alkene groups will enhance GO physicochemical properties while preserving its intrinsic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The first neutral and cationic Mo imido alkylidene cyclic alkyl amino carbene (CAAC) complexes of the general formulae [Mo(N&#8208;Ar)(CHCMe2Ph)(X)2(CAAC)] and [Mo(N&#8208;Ar)(CHCMe2Ph)(X)(CAAC)][B(ArF)4] (X = Br, Cl, OTf, OC6F5; CAAC = 1&#8208;(2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3)&#8208;3,3,5,5&#8208;tetramethyltetrahydropyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) have been synthesized from molybdenum imido bishalide alkylidene DME precursors. Different combinations of the imido and &#8220;X&#8221; ligands have been employed to understand synthetic peculiarities. Selected complexes have been characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Due to the pronounced &#963;&#8208;donor/&#960;&#8208;acceptor characteristics of CAACs, the corresponding neutral and cationic molybdenum imido alkylidene CAAC complexes do not require the presence of stabilizing donor ligands such as nitriles.
Calculations on the PBE0&#8208;D3BJ/def2&#8208;TZVP level for PBE0&#8208;D3BJ/def2&#8208;SVP optimized geometries revealed partial charges at molybdenum similar to the corresponding molybdenum imido alkylidene N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes with a slightly higher polarization of the molybdenum alkylidene bond in the CAAC complexes. All cationic complexes have been tested in olefin metathesis reactions and showed improved activity compared to the analogous NHC complexes for hydrocarbon&#8208;based substrates, allowing for turnover numbers (TONs) up to 9500 even at room temperature. Some Mo imido alkylidene CAAC complexes are tolerant towards functional groups like thioethers and sulfonamides.</dc:description>

         <title>Preparation of buffered nano&#8208;submicron hierarchical structure hollow SiOx@C anodes for lithium&#8208;ion battery materials with carboxymethyl chitosan</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silicon&#8208;based materials are among the most promising anode materials for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the volume expansion and poor conductivity of silicon&#8208;based materials during the charge and discharge process seriously hinder their practical application in the field of anodes. Here, we choose carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) as the carbon source coating and binding on the surface of nano silicon and hollow silicon dioxide (H&#8208;SiO2) to form a hierarchical buffered structure of nano&#8208;hollow SiOx@C. The hollow H&#8208;SiO2 can alleviate the volume expansion of nano silicon during the lithiation process under continuous cycling. Meanwhile, the carbon layer carbonized by CMCS containing N&#8208;doping further regulates the silicon&#8217;s expansion and improves the conductivity of the active materials. The as prepared SiOx@C material exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 985.4 mAh g&#8208;1 with the decay rate of 0.27% per cycle in 150 cycles under the current density of 0.2 A g&#8208;1. It is proved that the hierarchical buffer structure nano&#8208;hollow SiOx@C anode material has practical application potential.</dc:description>

         <title>Sugar&#8208;Bridged Fullerene Dumbbells and Their Interaction with the [10]Cycloparaphenylene Nanoring</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel sugar&#8208;bridged fullerene dumbbells were synthesized and fully characterized. Methano&#8208; and furan&#8208;fused C60 interacted with [10]CPP, an electron&#8208;donating nanoring, to form bis&#8208;pseudorotaxanes. Interestingly, the methano&#8208;dumbbell molecules showed a different binding behaviour as mono&#8208;, bis&#8208;pseudorotaxanes as well as oligomers (polymers) were detected.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of four dumbbell&#8208;shaped fullerene molecules connected by isosorbide and isomannide moieties is presented. Additionally, their electrochemical behavior and their ability to form complexes with [10]cycloparaphenylene ([10]CPP) were investigated. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) results of the fullerene dumbbells demonstrate a high electron affinity, indicating their strong interaction with electron&#8208;donating counterparts such as carbon nanorings, which possess complementary charge and shape properties. To study the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of complexation, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was employed. NMR titration experiments provided further insights into the binding stoichiometries. Two distinct approaches were utilized to create bridged structures: one based on cyclopropane and the other based on furan. Regardless of the type of linker used, all derivatives formed conventional 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 complexes denoted as [10]CPP2&#8835;C60derivative. However, the methano&#8208;dumbbell molecules exhibited distinct binding behavior, resulting in the formation of mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;pseudorotaxanes, as well as oligomers (polymers). The formation of linear polymers holds significant potential for applications in solar energy conversion processes.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic afterglow nanoparticles are unique optical materials that emit light long after cessation of excitation. Due to their advantages of no need of real&#8208;time light excitation, avoiding autofluorescence, low imaging background, high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio, deep tissue penetration and high sensitivity, afterglow imaging technology has been widely used in cell tracking, biosensing, cancer diagnosis and cancer therapy, which provides an effective technical method for the acquisition of molecular information with high sensitivity, specificity and real&#8208;time at the cellular and living level.

         <title>Construction of Five Tryptophan Isomers and Application of the Isomers to Solid&#8208;Phase Total Syntheses of Lysocin E Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Five tryptophan (Trp) isomers were prepared in which the indole C3&#8208;substitution was changed to the C2/4/5/6/7&#8208;substitutions and were then applied to Fmoc&#8208;based solid&#8208;phase total syntheses of the analogues of antibiotic lysocin E. The biological evaluation revealed the importance of the precise three&#8208;dimensional shape of the original Trp residue.







Abstract
Tryptophan (Trp) plays a unique role in peptides and proteins as its indole ring possesses an electron&#8208;rich character and an N1&#8722;H hydrogen&#8208;bond donor. Because of its non&#8208;rotationally symmetric structure, synthetic alterations of the orientation of the indole ring would modulate the intrinsic structures and functions of peptides and proteins. Here we developed synthetic routes to the five Trp isomers in which the C3&#8208;substitution of the indole ring was changed to the C2/4/5/6/7&#8208;substitutions, and applied the five monomers to Fmoc&#8208;based solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. Specifically, the five monomers were prepared via Negishi cross&#8208;coupling reactions of C2/4/5/6/7&#8208;iodoindoles. To demonstrate the applicability of the monomers to the solid&#8208;phase synthesis, the five Trp isomers of macrocyclic antibiotic lysocin E were selected as target molecules and synthesized through peptide elongation, on&#8208;resin macrocyclization, and global deprotection. The Trp isomers displayed markedly weaker antibacterial activity than the parent natural product, revealing the biological importance of the precise three&#8208;dimensional shape of the original Trp residue of lysocin E. The present methods for the preparation and application of these five Trp isomers provide a new strategy for analyzing and modifying the specific functions of numerous Trp&#8208;containing peptides and proteins beyond this study.

The evaluation in hydrosilylation catalysis of six new benzo[h]quinoline&#8208;derived acetonitrilo pentamethylcyclopentadienyl iridium(III) tetrakis(3,5&#8208;bis&#8208;trifluoromethylphenyl)borate salts bearing different substituents &#8722;X (&#8722;OMe, &#8722;H, &#8722;Cl, &#8722;Br, &#8722;NO2 and &#8722;(NO2)2) at the heterochelating ligand shows direct substituent dependence consistent with the electrophilic activation of the hydrosilane by the precatalyst.







Abstract
The performance of six newly synthesized benzo[h]quinoline&#8208;derived acetonitrilo pentamethylcyclopentadienyl iridium(III) tetrakis(3,5&#8208;bis&#8208;trifluoromethylphenyl)borate salts bearing different substituents &#8722;X (&#8722;OMe, &#8722;H, &#8722;Cl, &#8722;Br, &#8722;NO2 and &#8722;(NO2)2) on the heterochelating ligand were evaluated in the dehydro&#8208;O&#8208;silylation of benzyl alcohol and the monohydrosilylation of 4&#8208;methoxybenzonitrile by Et3SiH, two reactions involving the electrophilic activation of the Si&#8722;H bond. The benchmark shows a direct dependence of the catalytic efficiency with the electronic effect of &#8722;X, which is confirmed by theoretical assessment of the intrinsic silylicities &#928; of hydridoiridium(III)&#8208;silylium adducts and by the theoretical evaluation of the propensity of hydridospecies to transfer the hydrido ligand to the activated substrate. The revisited analysis of the Ir&#8722;Si&#8722;H interactions shows that the most cohesive bond in hydridoiridium(III)&#8208;silylium adducts is the Ir&#8722;H one, while the Ir&#8722;Si is a weak donor&#8208;acceptor dative bond. The Si&#8230;H interaction in all the cases is noncovalent in nature and dominated by electrostatics confirming the heterolytic cleavage of the hydrosilane's Si&#8722;H bond in this key catalytically relevant species.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization for the Divergent Synthesis of Podophyllotoxin Derivatives by Rhodium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed methodology leads to four kinds of novel podophyllotoxin derivatives starting from readily available podophyllotoxin in a late&#8208;stage functionalization strategy. Some of them are found to show excellent anticancer activity. This direct C&#8722;H functionalization can be expressed the podophyllotoxin (roots of podophyllum species) being converted into derivatives (leaves) by rhodium catalysis. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. Li, H. Liu and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300960).

         <dc:description>The selective C7&#8208;allylation of indolines with allyl bromide under ruthenium catalysis has been revealed here. Under established reaction conditions, C7&#8208;allylation of various modified indolines, including drug compounds, was accomplished with good selectivity and yields. Based on combined experimental and density functional theory (DFT) studies, the olefin insertion route was energetically favorable among four possible pathways. Experimental and DFT studies revealed that C&#8208;H activation is reversible and the rate&#8208;limiting step in the olefin insertion pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Hierarchical Porous MoO 2 @Mo 2 N@C Composite via a Confined Pyrolysis Synthetic Strategy towards Lithium&#8208;ion Battery Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molybdenum dioxide (MoO2) demonstrates huge potential toward lithium ion storage due to its high theoretical capacity. The sluggish reaction kinetics and large volume change during cycling process, however, unavoidably lead to inferior electrochemical performance, thus failing to satisfy the requirements of practical applications. Herein, we developed a molybdenum&#8208;based oxyacid salt confined pyrolysis strategy to achieve a novel hierarchical porous MoO2@Mo2N@C composite. A two&#8208;step successive annealing process was proposed to obtain a hybrid phase of MoO2&#160;and Mo2N, which was used to further improve the electrochemical performance of MoO2&#8208;based anode. We demonstrate that the well&#8208;dispersed MoO2&#160;nanoparticles can ensure ample active sites exposure to the electrolyte, while conductive Mo2N quantum dots afford pseudo&#8208;capacitive response, which conduces to the migration of ions and electrons. Additionally, the interior voids could provide buffer spaces to surmount the effect of volume change, thereby avoiding the fracture of MoO2&#160;nanoparticles. Benefiting from the aforesaid synergies, the as&#8208;obtained MoO2@Mo2N@C electrode demonstrates a striking initial discharge capacity (1760.0 mAh g&#8208;1&#160;at 0.1 A g&#8208;1) and decent long&#8208;term cycling stability (652.5 mAh g&#8208;1&#160;at 1.0 A g&#8208;1). This work provides a new way for the construction of advanced anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>The s&#8208;p Nonhybrid Nature Causes Adaptive Superatomic States of Bismuth Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a joint experimental and theoretical study on the stability and reactivity of Bin+ (n = 5&#8211;33) clusters. The alternating odd&#8208;even effect on the reaction rates of Bin+ clusters with NO is observed, and Bi7+ finds the most inertness. First&#8208;principles calculation results reveal that the lowest energy structures of Bi6&#8210;9+ exhibit quasi&#8208;spherical geometry pertaining to the jellium shell model; however, but the Bin+ (n &#8805; 10) clusters adopt assembly structures. The prominent stability of Bi7+ is associated with its highly symmetric structure and superatomic states with a magic number of 34e closed shell. For the first time, we demonstrate that the unique s&#8208;p nonhybrid feature in bismuth rationalizes the stability of Bi6&#8211;9+ clusters within the jellium model, by filling the 6s electrons into the superatomic orbitals (forming &#8220;s&#8208;band&#8221;). Interestingly, the stability of 18e &#8220;s&#8208;band&#8221; coincides with the compact structure for Bin+ at n&#8804;9 but assembly structures for n &#8805;10, showing an accommodation of the s electrons to the geometric structure. The atomic p&#8208;orbitals also allow to form superatomic orbitals at higher energy levels, contributing to the preferable structures of tridentate binding units. We illustrate the s&#8208;p nonhybrid nature accommodates the structure and superatomic states of bismuth clusters.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Aspects of the Crabtree&#8208;Pfaltz Hydrogenation of Olefins &#8211; An Interplay of Experimentation and Quantum Chemical Computation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract
Introduction of Crabtree's iridium&#8208;based hydrogenation catalyst in 1977 marked a paradigm shift both with respect to the role of iridium in homogeneous catalysis as well as catalytic hy&#173;dro&#173;genation of olefins. In 1998, Pfaltz introduced an improved catalyst, by use of BARF&#8208; as anion, and established the first chiral variant of the Crabtree catalyst. This led to nume&#173;rous practical highly enantioselective syntheses. Elucidation of mechanistic de&#173;tails posed great problems because of instability of the crucial intermediates. A remarkable breakthrough was achieved by Brandt, Andersson et al. in 2003, based on dft calculations. These authors replaced a previously assumed IrI/IrIII catalytic cycle by a novel IrIII/IrV cycle. The proposal was experimentally verified by Pfaltz in 2014 and corroborated by advanced quantum chemical calculations. This essay is an attempt to de&#173;scribe a fascinating interplay of experi&#173;ments and quantum chemical calculations for an important syn&#173;thet&#173;ic method.</dc:description>

         <title>Merging Solid&#8208;Phase Peptide Synthesis and Automated Glycan Assembly to Prepare Lipid&#8208;Peptide&#8208;Glycan Chimeras</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biomaterials with improved biological features can be obtained by conjugating glycans to nanostructured peptides. Creating peptide&#8208;glycan chimeras requires superb chemoselectivity. We expedite access to such chimeras by merging peptide and glycan solid&#8208;phase syntheses employing a bifunctional monosaccharide. The concept was explored in the context of the on&#8208;resin generation of a model &#945;(1&#8594;6)tetramannoside linked to peptides, lipids, steroids, and adamantane. Chimeras containing a &#946;(1&#8594;6)tetraglucoside and self&#8208;assembling peptides such as FF, FFKLVFF, and the amphiphile palmitoyl&#8208;VVVAAAKKK were prepared in a fully automated manner. The robust synthetic protocol requires a single purification step to obtain overall yields of about 20%. The &#946;(1&#8594;6)tetraglucoside FFKLVFF chimera produces micelles rather than nanofibers formed by the peptide alone as judged by microscopy and circular dichroism. The peptide amphiphile&#8208;glycan chimera forms a disperse fiber network, creating opportunities for new glycan&#8208;based nanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Overall Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction over Heterogeneous Semiconductor Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The overall photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (PCRR) is an eco&#8208;friendly way to convert CO2 and H2O into high&#8208;value chemical feedstocks and fuels using solar energy. Herein, we comprehensively summarize the strategies developed to drive the efficient overall PCRR over heterogeneous semiconductor photocatalysts. Essential future research directions have also been discussed.







Abstract
The overall photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (PCRR), which uses solar energy to convert CO2 and H2O into chemical feedstocks or fuels without sacrificial reagents, plays a momentous role in CO2 utilization and solar energy conversion. However, significant challenges remain in achieving efficient conversion. Researchers have explored various strategies to realize the overall PCRR efficiently. In this Review, we first explain the criteria for evaluating the overall PCRR and then summarize the following strategies developed over the past decade to promote it: self&#8208;driving material development, Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction construction, cocatalyst loading, heteroatom doping, surface vacancy creation, and carrier&#8208;material matching. Finally, we discuss essential future research directions in the field. Through this comprehensive Review, we aim to provide strategic guidance for the development of efficient overall PCRR systems.

         <title>Easily Accessible Substituted Heterocyclic Hemithioindigos as Bistable Molecular Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thioaurone chromophores, also known as Hemithioindigos as they belong to the indigoid family, recently received a massive attraction because of their photoswitching properties. Here is presented a study on heterocyclic hemithioindigos (Het&#8208;HTIs) first from a synthetic part with the synthesis of very diversified structures involving electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor heterocycles but also different modifications on the thioindigo moiety. Another part is devoted to determining the photoswitching performances of these synthesised compounds highlighting the influence of the nature of the heterocycles on the photoisomerization capabilities, more noticeable than the modifications afforded on the thioindigo part. Among a series of 44 Het&#8208;this, some were reported as very interesting photoswitchable compounds, presenting an efficient Z&#8208;to&#8208;E photoisomerization in blue (82&#8208;85% E&#8208;isomer at 425 nm or 450 nm), an efficient E&#8208;to&#8208;Z photoisomerization in red (95% Z&#8208;isomer at 650 nM), and half&#8208;lives for metastable E&#8208;isomer of up to 54 days in a polar solvent (DMSO). Our results proved that heterocyclic hemithioindigos exhibit auspicious features as efficient photoswitches to anyone interested in controlling molecular mechanisms by light.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilizing Nitroxide Spin Labels for Structural and Conformational Studies of Biomolecules by Maleimide Treatment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitroxide (NO) spin radicals are effective in characterizing structures, interactions and dynamics of biomolecules. The EPR applications in cell lysates or intracellular milieu require stable spin labels, but NO radicals are unstable in such conditions. We showed that the destabilization of NO radicals in cell lysates or even in cells is caused by NADPH/NADH related enzymes, but not by the commonly believed reducing reagents such as GSH. Maleimide stabilizes the NO radicals in the cell lysates by consumption of the NADPH/NADH that are essential for the enzymes involved in destabilizing NO radicals, instead of serving as the thiol scavenger. The maleimide treatment retains the crowding properties of the intracellular components and allows to perform long&#8208;time EPR measurements of NO labeled biomolecules close to the intracellular conditions. The strategy of maleimide treatment on cell lysates for the EPR applications has been demonstrated on double electron&#8208;electron resonance (DEER) measurements on a number of NO labeled protein samples. The method opens a broad application range for the NO labeled biomolecules by EPR in conditions that resemble the intracellular milieu.</dc:description>

         <title>Foldamer Nanotubes Mediated Label&#8208;Free Detection of Protein&#8208;Small Molecule Interactions</title>

         <dc:description>
Label free detection of protein&#8208;small molecule interactions mediated by the helical peptide nanotubes using impedance spectroscopy is reported. This method can be used to detect interactions of protein and small molecules at very low concentrations.







Abstract
Development of miniaturized lab&#8208;on&#8208;chip devices for the detection of rapid and specific small molecule&#8208;protein binding interactions at very low concentrations holds significant importance in drug discovery and biomedical applications. Here, the label&#8208;free detection of small molecule&#8208;protein interactions is reported on the surface functionalizable nanotubes of &#945;,&#947;&#8208;hybrid peptide helical foldamers using nanoscale capacitance and impedance spectroscopy. The 12&#8208;helix conformation of the &#945;,&#947;&#8208;hybrid peptide observed in the single crystals, self&#8208;assembled into nanotubes in an aqueous environment with exposed cysteine thiols for small molecule conjugation. The binding of streptavidin to the covalently linked biotin on the surface of nanotubes was detected at the picomolar concentrations. No change in the capacitance and impedance were observed in the absence of either immobilized biotin or protein streptavidin. The functionalizable hybrid peptide nanotubes reported here pave the way for the label&#8208;free detection of various small molecule protein interactions at very low concentrations.

         <title>Photoinduced Minisci Reaction with Diazines: An Approach Toward Original Fused Heterocycles.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoinduced Minisci reaction on diazines, starting from carboxylic acid is reported using 4CzIPN (1&#8197;mol&#8201;%) as the photoinitiator. The reaction proceeds in good to excellent yields (28 examples, 44&#8201;% to 89&#8201;%) under white LEDs irradiation with a slight excess of the acid reagent (1.2&#8197;equiv.) and the extension to continuous flow was demonstrated. Further cyclization reactions were developed to build up unprecedented N&#8208;heterocycles building blocks. A plausible radical chain mechanism was suggested.







Abstract
Herein, we developed a photoinduced Minisci reaction on a large panel of diazines with good to excellent yields (28 examples, 44&#8201;% to 89&#8201;%). The reaction using 4CzIPN (1&#8197;mol&#8201;%) as photoinitiator was carried out under white LED irradiation and required a slight excess of the acid reagent (1.2&#8197;equiv.). Cyclization reactions were then developed to access original N&#8208;heterocycles building blocks for drug discovery programs. An extension of the reaction to continuous flow was also reported. Finally, the mechanism of the transformation was studied suggesting a plausible radical chain mechanism.

An extension of the reaction to continuous flow was also reported. Finally, the mechanism of the transformation was studied suggesting a plausible radical chain mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The discovery of new catalytic applications for metals remains an important goal in organic synthesis. Herein, the Cu&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of imidazolidine through heterocyclic recombination between aziridine and diazetidine is presented. The scope is sufficiently broad to form various imidazolidines, since the reaction conditions are suitable for many functional groups.Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Heterocyclic Recombination of Aziridine and Diazetidine for the Synthesis of Imidazolidine (Murakami et al.)







Abstract
The discovery of new catalytic applications for metals remains an important goal in organic synthesis. If a catalyst has multiple functions, such as inducing bond cleavage and formation, it can streamline multi&#8208;step transformations. Herein, the Cu&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of imidazolidine through heterocyclic recombination between aziridine and diazetidine is reported. Mechanistically, Cu catalyzes the conversion of diazetidine into the corresponding imine, which then reacts with aziridine to form imidazolidine. The scope is sufficiently wide to form various imidazolidines, as many functional groups are compatible with the reaction conditions.

         <title>Stepwise Stimuli&#8208;Responsive, Multicolor&#8208;Chromic Perylene Bisimide/Polyvinyl Alcohol Co&#8208;assembly System for Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular strategy based on a co&#8208;assembly system of perylene bisimides/polyvinyl alcohol for the application of multidimensional information encryption has been developed. The multidimensional chromic response is achieved through an evolution process including photoinduced electron transfer to PBI, packing rearrangement and oxidation of PBI radical anions/dianions.







Abstract
The issue of information security has become a concern in all aspects of daily life, prompting the development of encryption technologies. Therein, optical encryption using color/graphical patterns holds great potential. However, current approaches generally rely on monochromic change upon one or more stimuli, limiting their further application in advanced confidential encryption. Herein, we propose a delicate strategy based on a co&#8208;assembly system of perylene bisimides (PBI)/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) that demonstrates stepwise stimuli response and multicolor changes. The color of the supramolecular system changes from red to purple under the stimulus of UV light, and to orange when exposed to water. The multidimensional chromic response is achieved by an evolution process including the generation, packing rearrangement and quenching of PBI radical anions/dianions. With the virtues of photo&#8208; and hydrochromism, this novel co&#8208;assembly system was successfully employed for advanced anticounterfeiting and versatile information encryption applications.

         <title>Inversion of Diaza[5]Helicenes Through an N&#8722;N Bond Breaking Pathway</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diaza[5]helicenes with N&#8722;N linkages were found to racemize through the N&#8722;N bond&#8208;breaking pathway by kinetic experiments and DFT calculations. Modification of S to SO2 at the outer position of the helix reduced the electronic repulsion in the N&#8722;N bond, resulting in a significant increase in the inversion barrier.







Abstract
1,1&#8217;,10,10&#8217;&#8208;Biphenothiazine and its S,S,S&#8217;,S&#8217;&#8208;tetroxide are diaza[5]helicenes with N&#8722;N linkages. Kinetic experiments on racemization together with DFT calculations revealed that they undergo inversion through the N&#8722;N bond breaking pathway rather than the general conformational pathway. In these diaza[5]helicenes with this inversion mechanism, the reduction of electronic repulsion in the N&#8722;N bond by modification of S to SO2 at the outer position of the helix led to a significantly higher inversion barrier, 35.3&#8197;kcal/mol, compared to [5]helicene. 1,1&#8217;,10,10&#8217;&#8208;Biphenothiazine S,S,S&#8217;,S&#8217;&#8208;tetroxide was highly resistant to acid&#8208;mediated N&#8722;N bond breaking and racemization under acidic conditions.

         <title>Stable Spiro&#8208;Fused Diarylaminyl Radicals: A New Type of a Neutral Mixed&#8208;Valence System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of stable spiro&#8208;fused diarylaminyl radicals that are radical cations with the &#8220;canceled charge&#8221; was obtained. The radicals belong to Class&#8197;II Robin&#8208;Day neutral mixed&#8208;valence systems that are rare. They are valuable models to mimic natural electron transfer reactions promoting a deeper understanding of their mechanism. The advanced properties of the radicals make them of potential interest in materials science.







Abstract
A new type of neutral mixed&#8208;valence system was synthesized using a facile one&#8208;pot procedure. The spiro&#8208;conjugated framework is additionally &#8220;fastened&#8221; with a biphenyl bridge, which does not directly participate in spin delocalization but makes the molecule stable and influences the reorganization energy and the energy barrier of the intramolecular electron transfer. The in&#8208;depth experimental and quantum&#8208;chemical study allowed determining the radicals as the Class&#8197;II Robin&#8208;Day&#8208;mixed&#8208;valence systems.

     alt="Stable Spiro-Fused Diarylaminyl Radicals: A New Type of a Neutral Mixed-Valence System"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The first example&lt;/b&gt; of stable spiro-fused diarylaminyl radicals that are radical cations with the &#8220;canceled charge&#8221; was obtained. The radicals belong to Class&#8197;II Robin-Day neutral mixed-valence systems that are rare. They are valuable models to mimic natural electron transfer reactions promoting a deeper understanding of their mechanism. The advanced properties of the radicals make them of potential interest in materials science.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new type of neutral mixed-valence system was synthesized using a facile one-pot procedure. The spiro-conjugated framework is additionally &#8220;fastened&#8221; with a biphenyl bridge, which does not directly participate in spin delocalization but makes the molecule stable and influences the reorganization energy and the energy barrier of the intramolecular electron transfer. The in-depth experimental and quantum-chemical study allowed determining the radicals as the Class&#8197;II Robin-Day-mixed-valence systems. The structure of the radicals was confirmed by the X-ray data, which are relatively rare for Class&#8197;II MV molecules. Advanced properties of the radicals, such as an ambipolar redox behavior and panchromatic absorption in the visible and NIR regions, along with their stability, make them of interest for materials science. All radicals demonstrate the SOMO-HOMO inversion phenomenon, which was supported by the DFT and the experimental study.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Long&#8208;Lived Charge Separated States in Anthraquinone&#8208;Phenothiazine Dyads: Synthesis and Study of the Photophysical Property by Using Transient Optical and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;lived charge separated state was observed in phenothiazine&#8208;anthraquinone dyads containing adamantane linker. The photophysical processes were studied with steady state and femtosecond/nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopic method. The electron exchange of the radical ion pairs was quantified with time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectra.







Abstract
In order to obtain long&#8208;lived charge separated (CS) states in electron donor&#8208;acceptor dyads, herein we prepared a series of anthraquinone (AQ)&#8208;phenothiazine (PTZ) dyads, with adamantane as the linker. UV&#8211;vis absorption spectra show negligible electronic interaction between the AQ and PTZ units at ground state, yet charge transfer (CT) emission bands were observed. Nanosecond transient absorption shows that the 3AQ state is populated upon photoexcitation for AQ&#8208;PTZ in cyclohexane (CHX), but in acetonitrile (ACN) a 3CS state is formed. Similar results were observed for AQ&#8208;PTZ&#8208;M. The 3CS state lifetimes were determined as 0.52&#8197;&#956;s and 0.49&#8197;&#956;s, respectively. Upon oxidation of the PTZ unit, the 3AQ state was observed in both polar and non&#8208;polar solvents. For AQ&#8208;PTZ, femtosecond transient absorption spectra show fast formation of the 3AQ state in all solvents, with no charge separation in CHX, while formation of the 3CS state takes 106&#8197;ps in ACN. For AQ&#8208;PTZ&#8208;M, a 3CS state is formed in CHX within 241&#8197;ps. Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectra show that a radical ion pair with electron exchange energy of |2&#8197;J|&#8805;5.68&#8197;mT was observed for AQ&#8208;PTZ and AQ&#8208;PTZ&#8208;M, whereas in the dyads with the PTZ unit oxidized, only the 3AQ state was observed.

         <title>Molecular Donor&#8208;Acceptor Dyads for Single&#8208;Material Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of ambipolar molecular donor&#8208;acceptor dyads D5&#8208;D10 was synthesized and characterized allowing for the elaboration of valuable structure&#8208;property relationships, which were correlated to the photovoltaic performance in single&#8208;material organic solar cells, in which power conversion efficiencies of up to 4.3&#8201;% were reached.







Abstract
A series of ambipolar covalently linked oligothiophene&#8208;fullerene dyads have been synthesized by systematical structural variations. In this respect, the length of linker between donor and acceptor unit was altered and in a second series the terminal acceptor units in the donor unit of the dyads were varied. Characterization of the optical and redox properties gave valuable structure&#8208;property relationships and were correlated to the photovoltaic performance in single&#8208;material organic solar cells, in which power conversion efficiencies of up to 4.3&#8201;% were reached.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Drug Release from Nanometric Micelles in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micelles constructed with sydnonimines are cleaved upon addition of cyclooctynes in a bioorthogonal manner, leading to the massive release of an anticancer drug in living cells. Fast release of the drug triggered a stronger antiproliferative activity on tumor cells compared to the passive diffusion from the micelles core.







Abstract
We explored a bioorthogonal approach to release drugs from stimuli&#8208;responsive micelles inside tumor cells. The concept relies on sydnonimine&#8208;based micelles that undergo quantitative cleavage in presence of cyclooctynes, hence releasing their content within living cells. Four cleavable micelles were developed to allow massive burst release of Entinostat, a potent histone deacetylase inhibitor, following their internalization inside cancer cells. A comparative study on the influence of the bioorthogonal&#8208;mediated versus passive drug release from micelles was carried out. The results indicated that a fast release of the drug triggered a stronger antiproliferative activity on tumor cells compared to the passive diffusion of the drug from the micelles core. These finding may be of great interest for the development of new nanomedicines.

Chemoselective C=C bond transfer hydrogenation in &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones is described using a cost&#8208;effective pincer&#8208;ligated manganese catalyst at room temperature.







Abstract
Chemoselective transfer hydrogenation of C=C bond in &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones is demonstrated at room temperature employing a manganese(I) catalyst and half an equivalent of ammonia&#8208;borane (H3N&#8722;BH3). A series of mixed&#8208;donor pincer&#8208;ligated Mn(II) complexes, (tBu2PN3NPyz)MnX2 [&#954;P,&#954;N,&#954;N&#8208;(N&#8208;(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphaneyl)&#8208;6&#8208;(1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;amine)MnX2] {X=Cl (Mn2), X=Br (Mn3), X=I (Mn4)} were synthesized and characterized. Amongst the Mn(II) complexes, (Mn2, Mn3, Mn4) and Mn(I) complex, (tBu2PN3NPyz)Mn(CO)2Br (Mn1) screened; the Mn1 acts as an efficient catalyst for the chemoselective C=C bond reduction in &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. Various synthetically important functionalities like halides, methoxy, trifluoromethyl, benzyloxy, nitro, amine, and unconjugated alkene and alkyne groups, including heteroarenes, were compatible and provided saturated ketones in excellent yields (up to 97&#8201;%). A preliminary mechanistic study highlighted the crucial role of metal&#8211;ligand (M&#8211;L) cooperation through the dearomatization&#8208;aromatization process in catalyst Mn1 for the chemoselective C=C bond transfer hydrogenation.

         <title>Mechanism of Acyl Group Migration in Carbohydrates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acyl groups are prone to migrate in carbohydrates, causing issues in the laboratory setting. Migration could also have biological relevance, such as in regulation of cell signaling. Recently, deeper investigations have been performed on the mechanism of this phenomenon. In this concept article some of the investigations are discussed, providing insights into the mechanism and the migration process in general.







Abstract
Acyl group migration has been the subject of several studies. Such migration processes may cause problems during synthesis, isolation, and purification of different acyl&#8208;bearing compounds, and have biological relevance, for example, in the metabolism of pharmaceuticals. Considering the recent evidence of acyl group migration being possible even over glycosidic bonds, it could be hypothesized to be involved also in the regulation of biological activity of natural polysaccharides in the host cells. Migrations are mostly observed in carbohydrates, typically having several hydroxyl groups near each other. Several studies have investigated the migration in a single or only a few different carbohydrate molecules, providing different suggestions for the mechanisms of migration, seldom supported by comprehensive computational investigations. In this concept article we discuss the recent progress on the mechanistic aspects of acyl group migration, with carbohydrates in particular focus.

         <title>Synthesis and Conformational Analysis of Fullerene Torsion Balances for Assessing the Contribution of Dispersion and Anionic Character in Non&#8208;Covalent Arene&#8211;Fullerene Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of fullerene&#8208;derived molecular torsion balances have been synthesized to quantitatively evaluate the contribution of the dispersion force to the arene&#8212;fullerene interaction. The torsion balance with a mercaptophenyl group was converted to the corresponding thiophenolate anion by adding an amine. Consequently, the anionic arene&#8212;fullerene interactions were elucidated. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Yamada and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300877).

         <title>3&#8208;Ligated Phenothiazinyl&#8208;terephthalonitrile Dyads and Triads &#8208; Synthesis, Electronic Properties, Delayed Fluorescence and Electronic Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prompt and delayed emission: A series of 3&#8208;ligated or bridged phenothiazinyl&#8208;terephthalonitrile dyads and triads are accessed in a one&#8208;pot fashion and photophysical studies in solution, solid&#8208;state and in polymer matrix reveal TADF (thermally activated delayed fluorescence) as estimated experimentally for four dyes and confirmed by DFT/MRCI calculations for one dyad.







Abstract
The bromine&#8208;lithium exchange&#8208;borylation&#8208;Suzuki sequence efficiently furnishes phenothiazine&#8208;terephthalonitrile donor&#8208;acceptor dyads and triads in high yields. In contrast to most phenothiazine&#8208;acceptor conjugates the title compounds are ligated in p&#8208;position to the phenothiazine nitrogen atom. Moreover, the acceptors are either directly linked or ligated by an arylene bridge and p&#8208;anisyl N&#8208;substituents on the phenothiazine are chosen to lock the tricycle into an intra&#8208;configuration. Cyclic voltammetry reveals effects of bridging and ligation of the N&#8208;substituent. Optical spectroscopy likewise displays similar band gaps, large Stokes shifts and substantial to high quantum yields in solution, in the solid state and in PMMA matrix. Time&#8208;resolved fluorescence spectroscopy indicates quite long fluorescence decay times in solution and emission components in the microsecond time range. TADF properties are further assessed by fluorescence increase in deoxygenated solution, gated emission spectroscopy and temperature&#8208;dependent determination of phosphorescence. The nature of the electronically excited states is investigated by DFT/MRCI. While for the directly ligated dyad a singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap &#916;
of 0.24&#8197;eV can be estimated and is consistently confirmed by quantum chemical calculations on the lowest energy conformer, even lower 
of 0.029 and 0.008&#8197;eV are estimated for the investigated dyads and the triad in the solid state and in PMMA matrix.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The peripheral borylation of porphyrinoids has become a key step to prepare advanced functional materials. Herein we report the synthesis, electronic properties, and reactivity of borylated Subphthalocyanines. These compounds, which are prepared by Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura borylation in excellent yields, are easily purified, display a great stability, and serve as powerful starting materials for the post&#8208;functionalization of SubPcs via cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Remarkably, this novel approach is more efficient than the methodologies already described and enables the preparation of exotic systems, such as SubPc dimeric species linked by C&#8208;C bonds, which are not accessible so far and present promising properties for optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Intramolecular [2 + 2] Trapping of 1,2&#8208;Cyclohexadienes: a&#160;Route to Rigid, Angularly Fused Tricyclic Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,2&#8208;Cyclohexadienes generated under mild fluoride&#8208;mediated desilylative conditions undergo efficient intramolecular [2 + 2] trapping, providing tricyclic alkylidene cyclobutanes with complete diastereoselectivity for the cis&#8208;fused products. Pendent styrenes or electron&#8208;deficient olefins can trap simple 1,2&#8208;cyclohexadienes or their oxygenated counterparts, with 14 substrates being disclosed. Reactions proceed at ambient temperature using just cesium fluoride in up to 91% yield, and the necessary precursors are easily accessed from substituted 2&#8208;bromocyclohexenones. Multiple synthetic routes have been developed to install the appropriate functional groups required for [2 + 2] trapping.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile Urea Type Linker For Functionalisation of Natural Glycans and its Validation in Glycan Arrays</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: The isolation from organisms and readily available glycoproteins has become an increasingly convenient source of N&#8208;glycans for multiple applications including glycan microarrays, as reference standards in glycan analysis or as reagents that improve bioavailability of protein and peptide therapeutics through conjugation. A problematic step in the isolation process on a preparative scale can be the attachment of a linker for the improved purification, separation, immobilization and quantification of the glycan structures. Addressing this issue, we firstly aimed for the development of an UV active linker for a fast and reliable attachment to anomeric glycosylamines via urea bond formation. Secondly, we validated the new linker on glycan arrays in a comparative study with a collection of N&#8208;glycans which were screened against various lectins. In total, we coupled four structurally varied N&#8208;glycans to four different linkers, immobilized all constructs on a microarray and compared their binding affinities to four plant and fungal lectins of widely described specificity. Our study shows that the urea type linker showed an overall superior performance for lectin binding and once more, highlights the often neglected influence of the choice of linker on lectin recognition.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Crystalline Intermediates in Mechanochemical Cyclorhodation Reactions Elucidated by in situ X&#8208;ray Powder Diffraction and Computations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The occurrence of crystalline intermediates in mechanochemical reactions may be more widespread than previously assumed. For example, a recent study involving the acetate&#8208;assisted C&#8211;H activation of N&#8208;heterocycles with [Cp*RhCl2]2 by ball milling revealed the formation of transient cocrystals between the reagents prior to the C&#8211;H activation step. However, such crystalline intermediates were only observed through stepwise intervallic ex situ analysis and their exact role in the C&#8211;H activation process remained unclear. In the present study, we monitored the formation of discrete, stoichiometric cocrystals between benzo[h]quinoline and [Cp*RhCl2]2 by ball milling using in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray powder diffraction. This continuous analysis revealed an initial cocrystal that transformed into a second crystalline form. Computational studies showed that differences in non&#8208;covalent interactions made the [Cp*RhCl2]2 unit in the later&#8208;appearing cocrystal more reactive towards reaction with NaOAc. This demonstrated the advantage of cocrystal formation before the acetate&#8208;assisted metalation&#8208;deprotonation step and evidence how the net cooperative action of weak interactions between the reagents in mechanochemical experiments can lead to stable supramolecular assemblies, which can enhance substrate activation under ball milling conditions. This could explain the superiority of some mechanochemical reactions, such as acetate&#8208;assisted C&#8211;H activation, compared to their solution&#8208;based counterparts.</dc:description>

         <title>NAD(P)H:Quinone Acceptor Oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) Activatable Salicylamide H+/Cl&#8210; Transporters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NAD(P)H:quinone acceptor oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), a detoxifying enzyme overexpressed in tumors, plays a key role in protecting cancer cells against oxidative stress and thus has been considered an attractive candidate for activating prodrug(s). Herein, we report the first use of NQO1 for the selective activation of &#8216;protransporter&#8217; systems in cancer cells leading to the induction of apoptosis. Salicylamides, easily synthesizable small molecules, have been effectively used for efficient H+/Cl&#8210; symport across lipid membranes. The ion transport activity of salicylamides was efficiently abated by caging the OH group with NQO1 activatable quinones via either ether or ester linkage. The release of active transporters, following the reduction of quinone caged &#8216;protransporters&#8217; by NQO1, was verified. Both the transporters and protransporters exhibited significant toxicity towards the MCF&#8208;7 breast cancer line, mediated via the induction of oxidative stress, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and lysosomal deacidification. Induction of cell death via intrinsic apoptotic pathway was verified by monitoring PARP1 cleavage.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Investigations on Bismuth Catalyzed Reduction of Ketones and Phosphine Oxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the inferences from the mechanistic studies on the catalytic reduction of ketones and phosphine oxides using the organobismuth dication [NMe2C6H4Bi(L)3][Al{OC(CF3)3}4] in the presence of silanes as reducing agents. Experiments and computations converge to a Si&#8722;H activation pathway in the reduction process.







Abstract
Lewis acidic bismuth compounds have found catalytic applications in the reduction of unsaturated bonds. In this work, we present the inferences from the mechanistic studies on the catalytic reduction of ketones and phosphine oxides using the organobismuth dication [NMe2C6H4Bi(L)3][Al{OC(CF3)3}4]2 in the presence of silanes as reducing agents. Experiments and computations converge to a Si&#8722;H activation pathway in the reduction process.

         <title>Isolation, Structural and Physical Characterization as well as Reactivity of Persistent Acenium Radical Cation Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first stable salts of unsubstituted radical cations of anthracene, tetracene and pentacene were isolated in the condensed phase by deelectronation of the respective neutral acenes. The radical cation salts were structurally, electrochemically and spectroscopically characterized (IR, Raman, UV&#8208;Vis, EPR).







Abstract
The unsubstituted acenium radical cations (ARCs) are extremely sensitive and were hitherto only studied in&#8197;situ, i.&#8201;e. in the gas phase, as dilute solutions in strong acids or by matrix isolation spectroscopy at about 10&#8197;K. In this study, room temperature stable ARC salts with the weakly coordinating anion [F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; (ORF=&#8722;OC(CF3)3) supported by the weakly coordinating solvent 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene (TFB) were prepared and structurally, electrochemically and spectroscopically characterized. Reaction of the neutral acenes with Ag+[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; led, non&#8208;innocent,[54] to intermediate [Ag2(acene)2]2+ complexes, which decompose over time to Ag0 and the corresponding (impure) ARC salts. By contrast, direct deelectronation with the recently developed innocent[54] deelectronator radical cation salt [anthraceneHal]+&#8901;[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; led to phase&#8208;pure products [acene]+&#8901;[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; (anthraceneHal=9,10&#8208;dichlorooctafluoroanthracene; acene=anthra&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, pentacene). For the first time, a homogenous set of spectroscopic data on analytically pure ARC salts was obtained. In addition, cyclovoltammetric measurements of the acenes connected the potentials in solution with those in the gas&#8208;phase. Hence, the data complement the existing isolated gas&#8208;phase, strong acid or matrix isolation studies. A first entry to follow&#8208;up chemistry of the acenium radical cations as ligand forming oxidizers was demonstrated by reaction with 
 Co2(CO)8 giving [Co(anthracene)(CO)2]+.

Reaction of the neutral acenes with Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;[F{Al(OR&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; led, &lt;i&gt;non-innocent&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;sup&gt;[54]&lt;/sup&gt; to intermediate [Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(acene)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; complexes, which decompose over time to Ag&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; and the corresponding (impure) ARC salts. By contrast, direct deelectronation with the recently developed &lt;i&gt;innocent&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;[54]&lt;/sup&gt; deelectronator radical cation salt [anthracene&lt;sup&gt;Hal&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&#8901;&lt;/sup&gt;[F{Al(OR&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; led to phase-pure products [acene]&lt;sup&gt;+&#8901;&lt;/sup&gt;[F{Al(OR&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (anthracene&lt;sup&gt;Hal&lt;/sup&gt;=9,10-dichlorooctafluoroanthracene; acene=anthra-, tetra-, pentacene). For the first time, a homogenous set of spectroscopic data on analytically pure ARC salts was obtained. In addition, cyclovoltammetric measurements of the acenes connected the potentials in solution with those in the gas-phase. Hence, the data complement the existing isolated gas-phase, strong acid or matrix isolation studies. A first entry to follow-up chemistry of the acenium radical cations as ligand forming oxidizers was demonstrated by reaction with 
 Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; giving [Co(anthracene)(CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>The molecular structure and photochemistry of&#160;dispiro[cyclohexane&#8208;1,3'&#8208;[1,2,4,5]tetraoxane&#8208;6',2''&#8208;tricyclo[3.3.1.13,7]decan]&#8208;4&#8208;one&#160;(TX), an antiparasitic 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetraoxane, was investigated using matrix isolation IR and EPR spectroscopies, and quantum chemical calculations at the DFT(B3LYP)/6&#8208;311++G(3df,3pd) level of theory. Photolysis of the matrix&#8208;isolated&#160;TX, induced by&#160;in situ&#160;broadband (l&#160;&gt; 235 nm) or narrowband (l&#160;in the range 220&#8208;263 nm) irradiation, led to two photoproducts, oxepane&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione and 4&#8208;oxohomoadamantan&#8208;5&#8208;one.&#160;&#160;Our studies show that these photoproducts result from initial photoinduced cleavage of an O&#8211;O bond, with formation of an oxygen&#8208;centered diradical that regioselectivity rearranges to a more stable (secondary carbon&#8208;centered)/(oxygen&#8208;centered) diradical, then yielding the final products. Formation of the diradical species was confirmed by EPR measurements, upon photolysis of&#160;TX&#160;at&#160;&#955;&#160;= 266 nm, in acetonitrile ice (T&#160;= 10&#8208;80 K). Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) studies demonstrated that&#160;TXadopts nearly the same conformation in the crystal and under matrix&#8208;isolation conditions, revealing that intermolecular interactions in the&#160;TX&#160;crystal are weak. This result is in keeping with observed similarities between the infrared spectra of crystalline and matrix&#8208;isolated&#160;TX. The structural, vibrational, and photochemical data reported here is relevant to the practical uses of&#160;TX (and tetraoxane analogues)&#160;in medicinal chemistry, considering its efficient and broad parasiticidal properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Polycrystalline Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Membranes for Separation of Light Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fabrication strategies of polycrystalline MOF membranes and the corresponding performance in separation of light hydrocarbons were classified and summarized. In addition, the perspective of this topic has also been proposed.







Abstract
Due to facile designability and versatile nanospace, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been considered as promising membrane materials. Compared to the mixed matrix membranes that incorporated with MOF particles, the polycrystalline MOF membranes demonstrates significant advantages in maximum utilizing the crystalline nanospace, and thus yielding a fruitful of achievements in the last twenty years. Although some reviews have summarized the development of MOF&#8208;based membranes, the theoretical framework for oriented design and preparation of polycrystalline MOF membranes for highly efficient separation of light hydrocarbons remains in infancy. Herein, in this review, the fabrication strategies of polycrystalline MOF membranes and the corresponding performance in the separation of light hydrocarbons were classified and summarized. Particularly, the MOF membranes with global and local dynamics have been proposed as an interesting topic promoted performance.

         <title>Nonorthogonal Cascade Catalysis in Multicompartment Micelles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acid&#8208;base bifunctional multicompartment micelle prepared from amphiphilic bottlebrush copolymers is reported for the nonorthogonal reaction sequence: deacetalization&#8208;Knoevenagel condensation &#8211; Michael addition of acetals to 2&#8208;amino chromene derivatives. Multicompartment micelles are promising nanostructures for compartmentalization of nonorthogonal catalysts for multistep transformations.







Abstract
Multicompartment micelles (MCMs) containing acid and base sites in discrete domains are prepared from poly(norbornene)&#8208;based amphiphilic bottlebrush copolymers in aqueous media. The acid and base sites are localized in different compartments of the micelle, enabling the nonorthogonal reaction sequence: deacetalization &#8211; Knoevenagel condensation &#8211; Michael addition of acetals to 2&#8208;amino chromene derivatives. Computational simulations using dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) elucidated the bottlebrush composition required to effectively site&#8208;isolate the nonorthogonal catalysts. This contribution presents MCMs as a new class of nanostructures for one&#8208;pot multistep nonorthogonal cascade catalysis, laying the groundwork for the isolation of three or more incompatible catalysts to synthesize value&#8208;added compounds in a single reaction vessel, in water.

         <title>Merger of Rotation Restriction and Symmetrical Push&#8208;Pull to Synthesize Single&#8208;Benzene Yellow Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of symmetrical push&#8208;pull motifs in combination with restricting bond rotations to suppress molecular motions that cause non&#8208;radiative transitions is the key to creating small yet brightly emitting fluorophores. The tetrahydrobenzodifuran moiety is an effective core architecture to realize unique and powerful single&#8208;benzene fluorophores with high quantum yields and large Stokes shifts in a wide range of solvents.







Abstract
Small yet brightly emitting fluorophores should find fundamental and practical applications in both academic and industrial settings. In this report, tetrahydrobenzodifuran is used as the core architecture to create novel single&#8208;benzene fluorophores. The key for realizing unique and powerful photophysical properties is the combination of the construction of symmetrical push&#8208;pull motifs and the restriction of bond rotations to suppress molecular motions that cause non&#8208;radiative transitions.

In this report, tetrahydrobenzodifuran is used as the core architecture to create novel single-benzene fluorophores. The key for realizing unique and powerful photophysical properties is the combination of the construction of symmetrical push-pull motifs and the restriction of bond rotations to suppress molecular motions that cause non-radiative transitions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cyanine&#8208; and Rhodamine&#8208;Derived Alkynes for the Selective Targeting of Cancerous Mitochondria through Radical Thiol&#8208;Yne Coupling in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By exploiting the combined effects of structure&#8208;induced accumulation and stimuli&#8208;responsive reactivity, cancerous mitochondria were selectively targeted by using cyanine&#8208;aryl acetylene conjugates. Covalent fixation of the conjugates, which is promoted by elevated pH and ROS levels in cancerous mitochondria, occurs through radical thiol&#8208;yne coupling, although no radical&#8208;based mechanism had previously been observed in live cells.







Abstract
Despite their long history and their synthetic potential underlined by various recent advances, radical thiol&#8208;yne coupling reactions have so far only rarely been exploited for the functionalization of biomolecules, and no examples yet exist for their application in live cells &#8208; although natural thiols show widespread occurrence therein. By taking advantage of the particular cellular conditions of mitochondria in cancer cells, we have demonstrated that radical thiol&#8208;yne coupling represents a powerful reaction principle for the selective targeting of these organelles. Within our studies, fluorescently labeled reactive alkyne probes were investigated, for which the fluorescent moiety was chosen to enable both mitochondria accumulation as well as highly sensitive detection. After preliminary studies under cell&#8208;free conditions, the most promising alkyne&#8208;dye conjugates were evaluated in various cellular experiments comprising analysis by flow cytometry and microscopy. All in all, these results pave the way for improved future therapeutic strategies relying on live&#8208;cell compatibility and selectivity among cellular compartments.

         <title>Design of Cu&#8208;Substituted O3&#8208;Type NaFe0.5Mn0.5O2 Cathode Materials for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
The effect of different copper contents on the electrochemical performance of environmentally friendly CO/Ni&#8208;free O3&#8208;type Fe/Mn&#8208;based cathode is systematically investigated. The introduction of a high proportion of copper can simultaneously regulate both the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface and the bulk phase. Therefore, the obtained cathode material with an optimized component of NaCu0.20Fe0.30Mn0.50O2 achieves a significant improvement in electrochemical performance.







Abstract
O3&#8208;type Fe/Mn&#8208;based layered oxide cathode materials with abundant reserves have a promising prospect in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the electrochemical reversibility of most O3&#8208;type Fe/Mn&#8208;based oxide cathode materials is still not high enough. Herein, the effect of different Cu contents on the electrochemical properties of O3&#8208;NaFe0.50Mn0.50O2 materials is systematically investigated. The as&#8208;prepared NaFe0.30Mn0.50Cu0.20O2 cathode achieves the synergistic optimization of the interface and bulk phase. It shows superior electrochemical performance, with an initial discharge specific capacity of 114&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C, a capacity retention rate of 94&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C, and excellent chemical stability in air and water. In addition, the sodium ion full battery based on NaFe0.30Mn0.50Cu0.20O2 cathode and hard carbon anode has a capacity retention rate of 81&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles. This research provides a useful approach for the preparation of low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance O3&#8208;type layered cathode materials.

         <title>Pushing the Boundary of Covalency in Lanthanoid&#8208;Tellurium Bonds: Insights from the Synthesis, Molecular and Electronic Structures of Low&#8208;Coordinate, Monomeric Europium(II) and Ytterbium(II) Tellurolates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of low&#8208;coordinate, monomeric europium(II) and ytterbium(II) tellurolate complexes is achieved using hybrid tellurolate ligands containing N&#8208;donor pendant arms. According to DFT calculations, while the complexes have most of their lanthanoid&#8208;tellurium bonds located on the Te atoms, the lanthanoid metals contribute significantly to the bond, thus resulting in a notable covalency.







Abstract
Owing to the strict hard/soft dichotomy between the lanthanoids and tellurium atoms, and the strong affinity of lanthanoid ions for high coordination numbers, low&#8208;coordinate, monomeric lanthanoid tellurolate complexes have remained elusive as compared to the lanthanoid complexes with lighter group 16 elements (O, S, and Se). This makes the development of suitable ligand systems for low&#8208;coordinate, monomeric lanthanoid tellurolate complexes an appealing endeavor. In a first report, a series of low&#8208;coordinate, monomeric lanthanoid (Yb, Eu) tellurolate complexes were synthesized by utilizing hybrid organotellurolate ligands containing N&#8208;donor pendant arms. The reaction of bis[2&#8208;((dimethylamino)methyl)phenyl] ditelluride, 1 and 8,8&#8242;diquinolinyl ditelluride, 2 with Ln0 metals (Ln=Eu, Yb) resulted in the formation of monomeric complexes [LnII(TeR)2(Solv)2] [R=C6H4&#8208;2&#8208;CH2NMe2] [3: Ln=Eu, Solv=tetrahydrofuran; 4: Ln=Eu, Solv=acetonitrile; 5: Ln=Yb, Solv=tetrahydrofuran; 6: Ln=Yb, Solv=pyridine] and [EuII(TeNC9H6)2(Solv)n] (7: Solv=tetrahydrofuran, n=3; 8: Solv=1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane, n=2), respectively. Complexes 3&#8211;4 and 7&#8211;8 represent the first sets of examples of monomeric europium tellurolate complexes. The molecular structures of complexes 3&#8211;8 are validated by single&#8211;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. The electronic structures of these complexes were investigated using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, which revealed appreciable covalency between the tellurolate ligands and lanthanoids.

         <title>Alkali Metal Halide Ion&#8208;Pair Binding in Conformationally Dynamic Halogen Bonding Heteroditopic [2]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of heteroditopic halogen bonding [2]rotaxanes display metal cation binding&#8208;induced co&#8208;conformational dynamism and significant positive cooperativity upon binding of alkali metal halide ion&#8208;pairs. Detailed analysis of the 1H&#8197;NMR titration spectra reveal a complex suite of parallel and competing equilibria which need to be considered to obtain reliable estimates of the rotaxanes&#8217; ion&#8208;pair binding affinities.







Abstract
A series of heteroditopic halogen bonding (XB) [2]rotaxanes were prepared via a combination of passive and active metal template&#8208;directed strategies. The ability of the [2]rotaxanes to bind alkali metal halide ion&#8208;pairs was investigated by extensive 1H&#8197;NMR titration studies, wherein detailed analysis of cation, anion and ion&#8208;pair affinity measurements indicate dramatic positive cooperative enhancements in halide anion association upon either Na+ or K+ pre&#8208;complexation. This study demonstrates that careful consideration of multiple, parallel and competing binding equilibria is essential when interpreting observed 1H&#8197;NMR spectral changes in ion&#8208;pair receptor systems, especially those which exhibit dynamic behaviour. Importantly, in comparison to XB [2]catenane analogues, these neutral XB heteroditopic [2]rotaxane host systems demonstrated that despite their relatively weaker cation and anion binding affinities, they exhibit a notably higher level of positive cooperativity for alkali metal halide ion&#8208;pair binding, highlighting the role of greater co&#8208;conformational adaptive behaviour in mechanically&#8208;bonded hosts for the purposes of charged species recognition.

         <title>Beyond the Limits of Atropochirality: Design of Highly Conformationally Restrained Biaryls with Bridgehead Phosphine Oxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atropochirality in 2,2&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted biaryls is a long&#8208;standing quest, and only the bulkiest substituents slow down their rotation. However, a new and rigid bicyclic scaffold has recently been developed. This scaffold has successfully pushed the limits of atropochirality even with substituents as small as fluorine atom. By using variable temperature NMR spectroscopy and DFT computational studies, insights about the mechanism of isomerisation were gained.







Abstract
In the last three decades, reacting sterically congested ortho&#8208;substituted arenes to form atropochiral biaryls is an appealing venture and a challenging subject that has garnered significant attention. Therefore, there is interest in developing methods to prepare these compounds. In this study, an efficient approach to produce a new class 2,2&#8217; disubstituted biaryls bridgehead phosphine oxides with an unusual topology and exceptional conformational stability is presented. Our methodology demonstrates that depending on the substitution pattern on the aryl moieties, the methanophosphocine backbone could be rigid enough to observe a double atropochirality, resulting in an under covered class of molecules. Notably, our studies revealed that replacing only one hydrogen at the ortho position by a fluorine atom led to sufficiently restricted rotation at temperatures below 80&#8201;&#176;C, extending &#8220;far away&#8221; the limits of atropostability. Finally, our investigations, which employed variable&#8208;temperature NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations, yielded unique insights into the isomerisation mechanism, indicating that the two biaryl motifs are fully independent in spite of their proximity.

         <title>Cyclic Polymers: Controlled Synthesis, Properties and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in controlled synthesis, applications, and future perspectives of cyclic polymers were reviewed and discussed. Major research efforts have been achieved to date regarding the synthesis of cyclic polymers which lead to the expansion of the scope and a growing diversity within this class of molecules. It is believed that a broad range of application prospects will be accessible in the future due to perpetual investigation in this research field. This review aims to turn the spotlight on synthetic strategies for cyclic polymers and encourages further research on this versatile compound class.







Abstract
Recently, cyclic polymers have attracted increasing interest due to their unique topologies, properties, and functions compared to the linear analogues. This mini&#8208;review focuses on the recent advances in the synthesis and applications of cyclic polymers. First, the main synthetic methods for cyclic polymers, namely ring closure and ring expansion methods, are presented and discussed, followed by a review on the exploration of the properties and applications of synthetic cyclic polymers. Finally, a critical assessment of the preliminary studies exploring the efficient synthesis and potential applications of cyclic polymers are presented, and the remaining challenges in the field as well as ideas for solving these challenges will be discussed.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework&#8208;Supported Metallocene for Ethylene Polymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Loading of homogeneous catalysts with support can dramatically improve their performance in olefin polymerization. However, the challenge lies in the development of supported catalysts with well&#8208;defined pore structures and good compatibility to achieve high catalytic activity and product performance. Herein, we report the use of an emergent class of porous material &#8208;&#8208; covalent organic framework material (COF) as a carrier to support metallocene catalyst &#8208;&#8208; Cp2ZrCl2 for ethylene polymerization. The COF&#8208;supported catalyst demonstrates a higher catalytic activity of 31.1 &#215; 106 g/(mol&#183;h) at 140 &#176;C, compared with 11.2 &#215; 106 g/(mol&#183;h) of the homogenous one. The resulting polyethylene (PE) products possess higher weight&#8208;average molecular weight (Mw) and narrower molecular weight distribution (&#393;) after COF supporting, i.e., Mw increases from 160 kDa to 308 kDa and &#393; reduces from 3.3 to 2.2. The melting point (Tm) is also increased by up to 5.2 &#176;C. Moreover, the PE product possesses a characteristic filamentous microstructure and demonstrates an increased tensile strength from 19.0 MPa to 30.7 MPa and elongation at break from 350% to 1400% after catalyst loading. We believe that the use of COF carriers will facilitate the future development of supported catalysts for high&#8208;efficient olefin polymerization and high&#8208;performance polyolefins.</dc:description>

         <title>A 2,2&#8208;Difluoroimidazolidine Derivative for Deoxyfluorination Reactions: Mechanistic Insights by Experimental and Computational Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A N&#8208;heterocyclic deoxyfluorinating agent SIMesF2 was synthesized by nucleophilic fluorination of N,N&#8208;1,3&#8208;dimesityl&#8208;2&#8208;chloroimidazolidinium&#160;chloride&#160;(3) at room temperature. SIMesF2 was applied to deoxyfluorinate carboxylic acids and alcohols and convert benzaldehyde into difluorotoluene. Mechanistic studies by NMR spectroscopy suggest reaction pathways of the carboxylic acid to acyl fluoride via outer&#8208;sphere fluorinations at an imidazolidinium ion by polyfluoride. DFT studies give further insight by exploring mechanistic details which distinguish the fluorination of aldehydes from that of carboxylic acids. Furthermore, a consecutive reaction sequence for the oxidation of an aldehyde followed by in situ fluorination the generated carboxylic acid was developed.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is a rapidly growing discipline with many analytical applications from immunoassays to single molecule detection. At the forefront of ECL research is materials chemistry which looks at engineering new materials and compounds exhibiting enhanced ECL efficiencies compared to conventional fluorescent materials. In this minireview, we summarize recent molecular design strategies that lead to high efficiency ECL. In particular, we feature recent advances in the use of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters to produce enhanced electrochemiluminescence. We also document how hydrogen&#8208;bonding, aggregation, and crystallization can each be recruited in the design of materials showing enhanced electrochemiluminescence.</dc:description>

The chiral probe selectively affects only one part of the binary ionic liquid, i.e., it has been shown before experimentally and theoretically that the particular imidazolium cation can be affected by chirality transfer, but in the present system chirality is only transferred to the anion and not to both parts of the solvent (anion and cation). This observation is of high relevance because of its selectivity and because anion effects are usually much more important in ionic liquid research than cation effects. From ab initio&#160;molecular dynamics simulations, a conformational analysis and dissected vibrational circular dichroism spectra are obtained to study the chirality transfer. While in the neat ionic liquid two mirror imaged trans&#160;conformers of the anion occur almost equally, we observe an excess of one of these conformers in the presence of the chiral solute, causing optical activity of the anion. Although, the cis&#160;conformers are not tremendously affected by the chirality transfer, they gain in total population when (R)&#8208;1,2&#8208;propylene oxide is dissolved in the ionic liquid.</dc:description>

         <title>2&#8208;Benzamide Tellurenyl Iodides: Synthesis and Their Catalytic Role in CO2 Mitigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzamide&#8208;derived organochalcogens (chalcogen = S, Se, and Te) have shown promising interest in biological and synthetic chemistry. Ebselen molecule derived from benzamide moiety is the most studied organoselenium. However, its heavier congener organotellurium is under&#8208;explored. Here, an efficient copper&#8208;catalyzed atom economical synthetic method has been developed to synthesize 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;benzamide tellurenyl iodides by inserting a tellurium atom into carbon&#8208;iodine bond of 2&#8208;iodobenzamides in one pot with 78&#8208;95% yields. Further, the Lewis acidic nature of Te center and Lewis basic nature of nitrogen of the synthesized 2&#8208;Iodo&#8208;N&#8208;(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)benzamide tellurenyl iodides enabled them as pre&#8208;catalyst for the activation of epoxide with CO2 at 1 atm for the preparation of cyclic carbonates with TOF and TON values of 1447 h&#8208;1 and 4343, respectively, under solvent&#8208;free conditions. In addition, 2&#8208;iodo&#8208;N&#8208;(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)benzamide tellurenyl iodides have also been used as pre&#8208;catalyst for activating anilines and CO2 to form a variety of 1,3&#8208;diaryl ureas up to 95% yield. The mechanistic investigation for CO2 mitigation is done by 125Te NMR and HRMS studies. It seems that the reaction proceeds via formation of catalytically active Te&#8208;N heterocycle, an ebtellur intermediate which is isolated and structurally characterized.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report several examples of the cyaphide&#8208;azide 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reaction to afford metallo&#8208;triazaphospholes. The gold(I) triazaphospholes Au(IDipp)(CPN3R) (IDipp = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene; R = tBu, Ad, Dipp), magnesium(II) triazaphospholes, {Mg(DippNacNac)(CPN3R)}2 (DippNacNac = CH{C(CH3)N(Dipp)}2, Dipp = 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl; R = tBu, Bn), and germanium(II) triazaphosphole Ge(DippNacNac)&#8208;(CPN3tBu) can be prepared straightforwardly, under mild conditions and in good yields, in a manner reminiscent of the classic alkyne&#8208;azide click reaction (albeit without a catalyst). This reactivity can be extended to compounds with two azide functional groups such as 1,3&#8208;diazidobenzene. We go on to show that the resulting metallo&#8208;triazaphospholes can be used as precursors to carbon&#8208;functionalized species, including protio&#8208; and iodo&#8208;triazaphospholes.</dc:description>

         <title>The Oxidation of Oxygen and Sulfur&#8208;Containing Heterocycles by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily of monooxygenase enzymes play important roles in the metabolism of molecules which contain heterocyclic, aromatic functional groups. Here we study how oxygen&#8208; and sulfur&#8208;containing heterocyclic groups interact with and are oxidized using the bacterial enzyme CYP199A4. This enzyme oxidized both 4&#8208;(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzoic acid and 4&#8208;(thiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)benzoic acid almost exclusively via sulfoxidation. The thiophene oxides produced were activated towards Diels&#8208;Alder dimerization after sulfoxidation, forming dimeric metabolites. Despite X&#8208;ray crystal structures demonstrating that the aromatic carbon atoms of the thiophene ring were located closer to the heme than the sulfur, sulfoxidation was still favoured with 4&#8208;(thiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)benzoic acid. These results highlight a preference of this cytochrome P450 enzyme for sulfoxidation over aromatic hydroxylation. Calculations predict a strong preference for homodimerization of the enantiomers of the thiophene oxides and the formation of a single major product, in broad agreement with the experimental data. 4&#8208;(Furan&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzoic acid was oxidized to 4&#8208;(4'&#8208;hydroxybutanoyl)benzoic acid using a whole&#8208;cell system. This reaction proceeded via a g&#8208;keto&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehyde species which could be trapped in vitro using semicarbazide to generate a pyridazine species. The combination of the enzyme structures, the biochemical data and theoretical calculations provides detailed insight into the formation of the metabolites formed from these heterocyclic compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>SN2 versus E2 Competition of Cyclic Ethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have quantum chemically studied the influence of ring strain on the competition between the two mechanistically different SN2 and E2 pathways using a series of archetypal ethers as substrate in combination with a diverse set of Lewis bases (F&#8211;, Cl&#8211;, Br&#8211;, HO&#8211;, H3CO&#8211;, HS&#8211;, H3CS&#8211;), using relativistic density functional theory at ZORA&#8208;OLYP/QZ4P. The ring strain in the substrate is systematically increased on going from a model acyclic ether to a 6&#8208; to 5&#8208; to 4&#8208; to 3&#8208;membered ether ring. We have found that the activation energy of the SN2 pathway sharply decreases when the ring strain of the system is increased, thus on going from large to small cyclic ethers, the SN2 reactivity increases. In contrast, the activation energy of the E2 pathway generally rises along this same series, that is, from large to small cyclic ethers. The opposing reactivity trends induce a mechanistic switch in the preferred reaction pathway for strong Lewis bases from E2, for large cyclic substrates, to SN2, for small cyclic substrates. Weak Lewis bases are unable to overcome the higher intrinsic distortivity of the E2 pathway and, therefore, always favor the less distortive SN2 reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>A Blueprint for the Stabilization of Sub&#8208;Valent Alkaline Earth Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The study of sub&#8208;valent Group 2 chemistry is a relatively new research field, being established in 2007 with the report of the first Mg(I) dimers. These species are stabilized by the formation of a Mg&#8211;Mg covalent bond; however, the extension of this chemistry to heavier alkaline earth (AE) metals has been frustrated by significant synthetic challenges, primarily associated with the instability of heavy AE&#8211;AE interactions. Here we present a new blueprint for the stabilization of heavy AE(I) complexes, based upon the reduction of AE(II) precursors with planar coordination geometries. We report the synthesis and structural characterisation of homoleptic trigonal planar AE(II) complexes of the monodentate amides {N(SiMe3)2}&#8211; and {N(Mes)(SiMe3)}&#8211;. DFT calculations showed that the LUMOs of these complexes all show some d&#8208;character for AE = Ca&#8208;Ba. DFT analysis of the square planar Sr(II) complex [Sr{N(SiMe3)2}(dioxane)2]&#8734; revealed analogous frontier orbital d&#8208;character. AE(I) complexes that could be accessed by reduction of these AE(II) precursors were modelled computationally, revealing exergonic formation in all cases. Crucially, NBO calculations show that some d&#8208;character is preserved in the SOMO of theoretical AE(I) products upon reduction, showing that d&#8208;orbitals could play a crucial role in achieving stable heavy AE(I) complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivity of [AuF3(SIMes)] &#8211; Pathway to Unprecedented Structural Motifs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on a comprehensive reactivity study starting from [AuF3(SIMes)] to synthesize different motifs of monomeric gold(III) fluorides. A plethora of different ligands has been introduced in a mono&#8208;substitution yielding trans&#8208;[AuF2X(SIMes)] including alkynido, cyanido, azido, and a set of perfluoroalkoxido complexes. The latter were better accomplished via use of perfluorinated carbonyl&#8208;bearing molecules, which is unprecedented in gold chemistry. In case of the cyanide and azide, triple substitution gave rise to the corresponding [AuX3(SIMes)] complexes. Comparison of the chemical shift of the carbene carbon atom in the 13C{1H} NMR spectrum, the calculated SIMes affinity and the Au&#8211;C bond length in the solid state with related literature&#8208;known complexes yields a classification of trans&#8208;influences for a variety of ligands attached to the gold center. Therein, the mixed fluorido perfluoroalkoxido complexes have a similar SIMes affinity to AuF3 with a very low Gibbs energy of formation when using the perfluoro carbonyl route.</dc:description>

         <title>Infrared Spectroscopic and Theoretical Investigations of Group 13 Oxyfluorides OMF2 and OMF (M = B, Al, Ga, In)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Group 13 oxyfluorides OMF2 were produced by the reactions of laser&#8208;ablated group 13 atoms M (M = B, Al, Ga and In) with OF2 and isolated in excess neon or argon matrices at 5 K. These molecules were characterized by matrix&#8208;isolation infrared spectroscopy and isotopic substitution experiments in conjunction with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. The calculations indicate that the OMF2 molecules have a 2B2 ground state with C2v symmetry. The computed molecular orbitals and spin densities show that the unpaired electron is mainly located at the terminal oxygen atom. Oxo monofluorides OMF were only observed in solid argon matrices and exhibit a linear structure in the singlet ground state. The M&#8722;O bonding in the OMF molecules can be rationalized as highly polar multiple bonds based on the calculated bond lengths and natural resonance theory (NRT) analyses. In particular, the molecular orbitals of OBF exhibit the character of a triple bond B&#8722;O resulting from two degenerate electron&#8208;sharing &#960; bonds and a O &#8594; B dative &#963; bond formed by the oxygen 2p lone pair which donates electron density to the boron empty 2p orbital.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Non&#8208;benzenoid non&#8208;alternant nanographenes (NGs) have attracted increasing attention on account of their distinct electronic and structural features in comparison to their isomeric benzenoid counterparts. In this work, we present a series of unprecedented azulene&#8208;embedded NGs on Au(111) during the attempted synthesis of cyclohepta[def]fluorene&#8208;based high&#8208;spin non&#8208;Kekul&#233; structure. Comprehensive scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy (nc&#8208;AFM) evidence structures and conformations of these unexpected products. The dynamics of the precursor bearing 9&#8208;(2,6&#8208;dimethylphenyl)anthracene and dihydro&#8208;dibenzo&#8208;cyclohepta[def]fluorene units and its reaction products on the surface are analyzed by density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,n&#8208;dicarbonyls are one of the most fascinating chemical feedstocks finding abundant usage in the field of pharmaceuticals. Besides, they are utilized in a plethora of synthesis in general synthetic organic chemistry. A number of &#8216;conventional&#8217; methods are available for their synthesis, such as the Stetter reaction, Baker&#8208;Venkatraman rearrangement, oxidation of vicinal diols, and oxidation of deoxybenzoins, synonymous with unfriendly reagents and conditions. In the last 15 years or so, photocatalysis has taken the world of synthetic organic chemistry by a remarkable renaissance. It is fair to say now that everybody loves the light and photoredox chemistry has opened a new gateway to organic chemists towards milder, more simpler alternatives to the previously available methods, allowing access to many sensitive reactions and products. In this review, we present the readers with the photochemical synthesis of a variety of 1,n&#8208;dicarbonyls. Diverse photocatalytic pathways to these fascinating molecules have been discussed, placing special emphasis on the mechanisms, giving the reader an opportunity to find all these significant developments in one place.</dc:description>

         <title>Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Based AIE Supramolecular Polymer Networks Exhibiting Various Fluorescence to Achieve Visible Surveillance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is significant to achieve visual surveillance of the formation process for supramolecular polymer networks (SPNs). A special AIEgen was introduced into SPNs constructed by host&#8211;guest recognition between pillar[5]arene and pyridine salt. With rising cross&#8208;linking degree, the fluorescence color changes from blue to green due to the gradual aggregated AIEgen, enabling the formation process becoming visually.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymer networks (SPNs) based on pillar[n]arene are widely studied and it is known that evolution from linear polymers to SPNs occurs as a progressive process, which is of importance to monitor the detailed morphology throughout the process. Yet, the current reports related to that distinction by employing fluorescence approach have realized confined success, it still remains a challenge to distinguish the various states visually. Herein, a fluorescent group of the pyrene benzohydrazonate&#8208;based (PBHZ&#8208;based) derivative is introduced into the pillar[5]arene based SPNs gained from host&#8211;guest recognition, enabling the visual monitoring during the formation of SPNs. The whole visual detection was based on the fluorescence color transition ranging from blue to green relying on the gradual aggregated PBHZ molecules upon the increasing cross&#8208;linking degree. Besides, the stimuli&#8208;responsiveness of this SPNs was confirmed that increasing the temperature or adding a reducing agent would reduce the cross&#8208;linking degree.

         <title>Fully Conjugated Benzyne&#8208;Derived Three&#8208;Dimensional Porous Organic Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of a 3D porous organic polymer starting from a simple 0D bistriflate precursor via in&#8197;situ CsF catalyzed formation of benzyne. This is the first demonstration of 3D polymer being prepared from a single and simple precursor. The resulting benzyne&#8208;derived porous organic polymer showed 544&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 surface area and IAST CO2/N2 selectivity of 65.4







Abstract
Porous organic polymers (POPs) have gained tremendous attention owing to their chemical tunability, stability and high surface areas. Whereas there are several examples of fully conjugated two&#8208;dimensional (2D) POPs, three&#8208;dimensional (3D) ones are rather challenging to realize in the absence of structural templates. Herein, we report the base&#8208;catalyzed direct synthesis of a fully conjugated 3D POPs, named benzyne&#8208;derived polymers (BDPs), containing biphenylene and tetraphenylene moieties starting from a simple bisbenzyne precursor, which undergoes [2+2] and [2+2+2+2] cycloaddition reactions to form BDPs primarily composed of biphenylene and tetraphenylene moieties. The resulting polymers exhibited ultramicroporous structures with surface areas up to 544&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and very high CO2/N2 selectivities.

         <title>Substituted meta[n]Cycloparaphenylenes: Synthesis, Photophysical Properties and Host&#8211;guest Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three different sized cyano&#8208;meta[n]cycloparaphenylenes (CN&#8208;m[n]CPPs) have been prepared for investigation of their photophysical properties. Furthermore, CN&#8208;m[6]CPP served as key substrate to demonstrate the versatility of the nitrile functionality and therefore a general concept towards functionalized m[n]CPPs was developed. Additionally, CN&#8208;m[10]CPP was used to report the first association constant of a m[10]CPP with fullerene C60.







Abstract
Breaking the centrosymmetry of [n]cycloparaphenylenes ([n]CPPs) by one meta connection, leads to bright emission in the typically non&#8208;fluorescent smaller derivatives, conserving their size dependent emissive properties. Using the building block strategy for [n]CPPs, different nitrile substituted meta[n]CPPs (n=6, 8, 10) have been prepared. The nitrile substituent offers a convenient handle for functional group conversions (e.g., carboxylic acid, amide, aldehyde, as well as 1H&#8208;tetrazole). Besides the synthetic work, the photophysical properties of these novel m[n]CPP derivatives have been characterized. Additionally, the host&#8211;guest ability of cyano&#8208;m[10]CPP has been explored by studying its complexation with fullerene C60. These insights open new applications of meta[n]CPPs as fluorophore in synthetic organic chemistry, material sciences as well as biomedical research.

         <title>Reexamining the Emergence and Stability of the Square Cylinder Phase in Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transition from the square cylinder phase to the rectangular cylinder phase is a second&#8208;order transition that accompanies the transition of the free&#8208;energy landscape from one minimum to two minima. The prolate contour lines of the free&#8208;energy landscape indicate the weak stability of the square phase in the 
 copolymer.







Abstract
Recently, a few AB&#8208;type multiblock copolymers have been successfully designed to form stable square cylinder phase based on self&#8208;consistent field theory (SCFT) calculations. The previous works only identify the stability region of the square phase but not analyzing its stability, which is closely related to the free&#8208;energy landscape. In this work, we have reexamined the stability of the square phase in 
 linear pentablock and 
 star triblock copolymers by drawing the free&#8208;energy landscape with respect to the two dimensions of a rectangular unit cell. Our results demonstrate that the square phase continuously transfers to the rectangular phase as the degree of packing frustration is gradually released. Moreover, the prolate contour lines of the free&#8208;energy landscape indicate the weak stability of the square phase in the 
 copolymer. In contrast, the stability of the square phase is notably improved in the 
 copolymer due to its enhanced concentration of bridging configurations. Our work sheds light on the understanding of the stability of the square cylinder phase in block copolymers. Accordingly, we propose some possible strategies for further designing new AB&#8208;type block copolymer systems to obtain more stable square phase.

         <title>Polymer Nanoantidotes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer nanoantidotes implement the detoxification process through three different patterns, physical interaction, chemical bonding, and biomimetic clearance, and their significant efficacy speculates on the opportunities for clinical application.







Abstract
Intoxication is one of the most common causes of accidental death globally. Although some antidotes capable of neutralizing the toxicity of certain xenobiotics have become well established, the current reality is that clinicians primarily rely on nonspecific extracorporeal techniques to remove toxins. Nano&#8208;intervention strategies in which nanoantidotes neutralize toxicity in&#8197;situ via physical interaction, chemical bonding, or biomimetic clearance have begun to show clinical potential. However, most nanoantidotes remain in the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept stage, and the difficulty of constructing clinical relevance models and the unclear pharmacokinetics of nanoantidotes hinder their translation to clinic. This Concept reviews the detoxification mechanisms of polymer nanoantidotes and predicts the opportunities and challenges associated with their clinical application.

         <title>Fast Visualized Conformational Transition of Polyphenylacetylenes with Stepwise Tunable Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel thermoresponsive polyphenylacetylene shows reversible conformation transition, fluorescent and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) switch. The conformational transition could be read out via the change of visible fluorescence signals. Moreover, the polymers displayed switchable CPL performance and the luminescent dissymmetry factor could be stepwise amplified by forming chiral aggregates or liquid crystalline structure.







Abstract
Two novel poly(3,5&#8208;diamide substituted phenylacetylene)s bearing L&#8208; or D&#8208;alanine residues with a long alkyl chain were synthesized. In low polar or apolar solvents, the polymers adopted contracted cis&#8208;cisoid helix showing strong yellow fluorescence, which was transferred to stretched cis&#8208;transoid helix by adding polar solvents or decreasing temperature, accompanied with the disappearance of fluorescence. The critical conformational transition temperature could be readily tuned in a wide range by altering the content of polar solvent, and the conformational variation at molecular level could be directly read out via the change in fluorescent property. The synergistical participation of amide and ester groups in the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds accelerated the conformational transition rate, resulting in remarkable reduction of hysteresis. Moreover, the polymers displayed switchable CPL performance and the luminescent dissymmetry factor could be stepwise amplified by forming chiral aggregates or liquid crystalline structure. This study may open a new avenue for the development of controllable helical structure&#8208;based smart CPL materials.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A novel thermoresponsive polyphenylacetylene&lt;/b&gt; shows reversible conformation transition, fluorescent and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) switch. The conformational transition could be read out via the change of visible fluorescence signals. Moreover, the polymers displayed switchable CPL performance and the luminescent dissymmetry factor could be stepwise amplified by forming chiral aggregates or liquid crystalline structure.

         <title>Selective Photodynamic Activity of Tetrakis(4&#8208;Aminophenyl)Porphyrins with and without Acetyl Protecting Groups on Cancer and Normal Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)porphyrin (1) and tetrakis(4&#8208;acetamidophenyl)porphyrin (2) were dissolved in water with the incorporation of a polysaccharide (&#955;&#8208;carrageenan (CGN)) as a water&#8208;solubilizing agent. Although the photodynamic activity of the CGN&#8208;2 complex was considerably lower than that of the CGN&#8208;1 complex, the selectivity index (SI; IC50 in a normal cell/IC50 in a cancer cell) of the CGN&#8208;2 complex was considerably higher than that of the CGN&#8208;1 complex. This is because the photodynamic activity of the CGN&#8208;2 complex was significantly affected by the intracellular uptakes by the normal and cancer cells. During in vivo experiments, the CGN&#8208;2 complex inhibited tumor growth under light irradiation with high blood retention compared with the CGN&#8208;1 complex and Photofrin, which exhibited lower blood retention. This study showed that the photodynamic activity and SI are influenced by substituent groups of arene in the meso&#8208;positions of porphyrin analogs.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Chemistry and Specific Surface Area rule the Efficiency of Gold Nanoparticle Sensitizers in Proton Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are known radiosensitizers in proton therapy (PT) applicable for the treatment of solid tumors, where they amplify production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, it is underexplored how this amplification is correlated with the AuNPs&#180; surface chemistry. To clarify this issue, we fabricated ligand&#8208;free AuNPs of different mean diameters by laser ablation in liquids (LAL) and laser fragmentation in liquids (LFL) and irradiated them with clinically relevant proton fields using water phantoms. ROS generation was monitored by the fluorescent dye 7&#8208;OH&#8208;coumarin. Our findings reveal an enhancement of ROS production driven by I) increased total particle surface area, II) utilization of ligand&#8208;free AuNPs avoiding sodium citrate as a radical quencher ligands, and III) a higher density of structural defects generated by LFL synthesis, indicated by surface charge density. Based on these findings it may be concluded that the surface chemistry is a major and underexplored contributor to ROS generation and sensitizing effects of AuNPs in PT. We further highlight the applicability of AuNPs in vitro in human medulloblastoma cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Factors Controlling Complex Morphologies of Isomorphous Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate here how nitrate salts of bivalent copper, nickel, cobalt, and manganese, along with an achiral organic ligand, assemble into various structures such as symmetrical double&#8208;decker flowers, smooth elongated hexagonal bipyramids, and hexagonal prisms. Large morphological changes occur in these structures because of different metal cations, although they maintain isomorphous hexagonal crystallographic structures. Metal cations with stronger coordination to ligands (Cu,&#160;Ni) tend to form uniform crystals with unusual shapes, whereas weaker coordinating metal cations (Mn,&#160;Co) produce crystals with more regular hexagonal morphologies.&#160; The unusual flower&#8208;like crystals formed with copper nitrate have two pairs of six symmetrical petals with hexagonal convex centers. The texture of the petals indicates dendritic growth. Two different types of morphologies were formed by using different copper nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ligand ratios. An excess of the metal salt results in uniform and monodisperse hexagonal crystals, whereas the use of an excess of ligand results in double&#8208;decker morphologies. Mechanistically, an intermediate structure was observed with slightly concave facets and a domed center. Such structures&#160;likely play a key role in the formation of double&#8208;decker crystals that can be formed by fusion processes. The coordination chemistry results in isostructural chiral frameworks consisting of two types of continuous helical channels.</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of Catalyst Deuteration on the Reactivity of Chiral Phase&#8208;Transfer Organocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Site&#8208;specifically deuterated organocatalysts were prepared and found to show improved reactivity over the non&#8208;deuterated analogs. Two privileged C2&#8208;symmetric chiral binaphthyl&#8208;modified tetraalkylammonium salts were selected for this study. The stability of these phase&#8208;transfer catalysts was generally improved by site&#8208;specific deuteration, though the degree of improvement was structure&#8208;dependent. In particular, a large secondary kinetic isotope effect was observed for the tetradeuterated phase&#8208;transfer catalyst. The performance of these deuterated catalysts in the asymmetric catalytic alkylation of amino acid derivatives was better than that of non&#8208;deuterated analogs at low catalyst loadings. The results suggest that catalyst&#8208;deuteration is a promising strategy for enhancing the stability and performance of organocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Formation of CoP/Co3O4 Heterojunction for Efficient Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical water splitting is an environmentally friendly and effective energy storage method. However, it is still a huge challenge for preparing no&#8208;noble metal based&#8208;electrocatalysts which possess high activity and long&#8208;term durability to realize efficient water splitting. Here, we put forward a novel method of low&#8208;temperature phosphating to prepare CoP/Co3O4 heterojunction nanowires catalyst on titanium mesh (TM) substrate for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and overall water splitting. CoP/Co3O4@TM heterojunction showed an excellent catalytic performance and long&#8208;term durability in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. The overpotential of CoP/Co3O4@TM heterojunction was only 257 mV at 20 mA cm&#8208;2 during the OER process, and it could work stably more than 40 h at 1.52 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE). During the HER process, the overpotential of CoP/Co3O4@TM heterojunction was only 107 mV at &#8208;10 mA cm&#8208;2. &#160;More importantly, when CoP/Co3O4@TM heterojunction were used as anodic and cathodic electrocatalysts, respectively, they displayed 10 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.59 V. The Faradaic efficiencies of OER and HER were 98.4% and 99.4%, respectively. It was more excellent than the Ru/Ir&#8208;based noble metal electrocatalysts and other non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalysts which have been reported for overall water splitting.</dc:description>

During the HER process, the overpotential of CoP/Co3O4@TM heterojunction was only 107 mV at -10 mA cm-2. &#160;More importantly, when CoP/Co3O4@TM heterojunction were used as anodic and cathodic electrocatalysts, respectively, they displayed 10 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.59 V. The Faradaic efficiencies of OER and HER were 98.4% and 99.4%, respectively. It was more excellent than the Ru/Ir-based noble metal electrocatalysts and other non-noble metal electrocatalysts which have been reported for overall water splitting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Evaluation of Biological Activity of Ferrocene&#8208;Ispinesib Hybrids &#8208; Impact of a Ferrocenyl Group on the Antiproliferative and KSP Inhibitory Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the aim to combine more than one biologically&#8208;active component in a single molecule, derivatives of ispinesib and its (S) analogue were prepared that featured ferrocenyl moieties or bulky organic substituents. Inspired by the strong kinesin spindle protein (KSP) inhibitory activity of ispinesib, the compounds were investigated for their antiproliferative activity. Among these compounds, several derivatives demonstrated significantly higher antiproliferative activity than ispinesib with nanomolar IC50&#160;values against cell lines. Further evaluation indicated that the antiproliferative activity is not directly correlated with their KSP inhibitory activity while docking suggested that several of the derivatives may bind in a manner similar to ispinesib. In order to investigate the mode of action further, cell cycle analysis and reactive oxygen species formation were investigated. The improved antiproliferative activity of the most active compounds may be assigned to synergic effect of various factors such as KPS inhibitory activity due to ispinesibe&#8208;core and ability to generate ROS and induce mitotic arrest.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced ring&#8208;opening and phototoxicity of an indolin&#8208;3&#8208;one derivative</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the study of a fluorescent indolin&#8208;3&#8208;one derivative that, as opposed to its previously described congeners, selectively undergoes photoactivated ring&#8208;opening in apolar solvents. The excited state involved in this photoisomerization was partially deactivated by the formation of singlet oxygen.&#160;Cell studies revealed lipid droplet accumulation and efficient light&#8208;induced cytotoxicity.</dc:description>

         <title>Modified Peptide Molecules As Potential Modulators of Shelterin Protein Functions; TRF1</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we present studies on relatively new and still not well&#8208;explored potential anticancer targets which are shelterin proteins, in particular the TRF1 protein can be blocked by in silico designed "peptidomimetic" molecules. TRF1 interacts directly with the TIN2 protein, and this protein&#8208;protein interaction is crucial for the proper functioning of telomere, which could be blocked by our novel modified peptide molecules. Our chemotherapeutic approach is based on assumption that modulation of TRF1&#8208;TIN2 interaction may be more harmful for cancer cells as cancer telomeres are more fragile than in normal cells. We have shown in vitro within SPR experiments that our modified peptide PEP1 molecule interacts with TRF1, presumably at the site originally occupied by the TIN2 protein. Disturbance of the shelterin complex by studied molecule may not in short term lead to cytotoxic effects, however blocking TRF1&#8208;TIN2 resulted in cellular senescence in cellular breast cancer lines used as a cancer model. Thus, our compounds appeared useful as starting model compounds for precise blockage of TRF proteins.</dc:description>
