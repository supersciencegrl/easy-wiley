         <title>Latest Progress on Synchronous Removal of Multiple Heavy Metal Cations and Anions: Adsorbent Design and Mechanism Elucidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

ABSTRACT
The development of highly efficient remediation technologies for heavy metal pollution has attracted widespread attention. Due to the &#8220;trade&#8208;off&#8221; effect arising from the different occurrence states and physical&#8208;chemical properties of heavy metal cations and anions in the different pH environments, the remediation of coexisting multiple heavy metal contamination is significantly complex and challenging. As such, the investigation of highly selective and efficient adsorbents for multiple heavy metals removal is the present focus of the scientific and industrial community. Under such circumstances, we report the latest progress on multiple heavy metals removal in this review. Firstly, we summarize the current situation of heavy metal contamination and the corresponding remediation methods. Secondly, we divide the discussion into three sections, including the heavy metal cation removal, heavy metal anion removal, and the coexisting multiple heavy metal removal from the perspective of removal mechanisms and the used adsorbents. Finally, we highlight the future challenges and opportunities in the development of promising adsorbents for multiple heavy metals removal.

         <title>A Versatile System of Solvent, Catalyst, and Ligand for Challenging Biphenyl Synthesis Through Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions with electron&#8208;deficient haloarenes and electron&#8208;deficient areneboronic acids proceed with moderate to excellent yields in N&#8208;methylpyrrolidone as solvent, Pd(dba)3 as catalyst, CuI as cocatalyst, and Davephos as ligand.








ABSTRACT
Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions are difficult when both reaction partners (boronic acid and halide) are electron&#8208;poor. We describe here a system of solvent, catalyst, and ligand with which also electron&#8208;poor substrates react, without the necessity to try several conditions. The system consists of N&#8208;methylpyrrolidone as solvent, tris(dibenzylidenaceton)dipalladium(0) as catalyst, CuI as cocatalyst, and Davephos as ligand. This combination yields little or no Ullmann product, and the desired cross&#8208;coupling product is in moderate to excellent yields.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of 2D Metal&#8208;Organic Framework as an Efficient Heterogeneous Catalyst for the Epoxidation of Olefin With H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the sacrificial template method, metal porphyrin was attached in situ to the ZnO surface to prepare surfactant&#8208;free, highly dispersed Zn&#8208;TCPP(Mn)/ZnO, which had a positive effect on the stability and activity of the catalyst. Notably, styrene underwent complete conversion within 20 min, with an impressive epoxide selectivity reaching 97%, and exhibits a remarkable conversion frequency of 1980 h&#8722;1. More significantly, the composite catalyst Zn&#8208;TCPP(Mn)/ZnO exhibits a structurally stable framework and maintains a substantial level of catalytic activity even after undergoing five consecutive cycles. Meanwhile, other substrates exhibited varying degrees of selectivity, ranging from moderate to commendable.








ABSTRACT
The 2D ultrathin MOF nanosheets, which effectively integrate metals and functional ligands, possess the advantageous features of molecular catalysts and exhibit remarkable catalytic activity in multiphase catalysis. Herein, we employed the sacrificial template method to achieve in situ attachment of metalloporphyrin onto a ZnO substrate, resulting in the formation of surfactant&#8208;free 2D dispersed structures of Zn&#8208;TCPP(Mn)/ZnO. The multilayered stacked B&#8208;Zn&#8208;TCPP(Mn) (3D) blocks were prepared by growing Zn2+ mixed with metalloporphyrin as a comparison. The novel composite catalyst Zn&#8208;TCPP(Mn)/ZnO was employed for the efficient epoxidation of various alkenes using H2O2 as an oxidant at ambient temperatures. Notably, alkenes conversion within 20 min achieves a high yield and impressive 1980 h&#8722;1 turnover frequency. The composite catalyst can still maintain its structural integrity after undergoing five consecutive cycles, and the total yield of oxidized styrene is slightly reduced. This was confirmed by a series of characterization analyses and other assessments. Additionally, comparative experiments revealed that the B&#8208;Zn&#8208;TCPP(Mn) blocks underwent partial exfoliation into 2D nanosheets following the catalytic reaction, thereby enhancing the catalytic conversion efficiency in subsequent epoxidation reactions. This finding provides compelling evidence for the heightened catalytic activity of 2D materials.

         <title>Enantioselective Assembly of Si&#8208;Stereogenic Sila&#8208;[1,4]oxazines via Sequential Si&#9472;O/Si&#9472;C Dehydrocoupling</title>

An iridium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective dehydrogenative coupling for synthesizing silicon&#8208;stereogenic sila&#8208;[1,4]oxazines is reported. This method directly constructs Si&#8208;stereogenic centers with high enantioselectivity, offering new avenues for silicon&#8208;containing heterocycles.








ABSTRACT
Silacycles have shown great promise in medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry, and materials science. In this study, we report an efficient iridium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective dehydrogenative coupling of pyrrolo&#8208;phenol derivatives with dihydrosilanes, which leads to the synthesis of Si&#8208;stereogenic sila&#8208;[1,4]oxazines with excellent enantioselectivity. This method successfully integrates silicon into the bioactive [1,4]oxazine framework, broadening the application scope of silicon&#8208;containing heterocycles. Mechanistic studies indicate a two&#8208;step sequence: an enantioselective Ir&#8208;catalyzed Si&#9472;O dehydrocoupling, followed by an intramolecular Si&#9472;C coupling.

         <title>Observation of Quinoxalinyl Radical Produced by Muonium Addition to 1,2&#8208;Diisocyanobenzene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This muon spectroscopic study analyzed a 1,2&#8208;diisocyanobenzene derivative, which led to the isocyanide insertion process. The transverse&#8208;field muon spin rotation (TF&#8208;&#181;SR) measurements observed the quinoxalinyl radical, and the imidoyl radical did not appear due to the prompt cyclization occurring faster than the muon timescale. The &#181;SR&#8208;characterized paramagnetic species was an aryl &#963; radical, exhibiting the corresponding high reactivity in the THF (tetrahydrofuran) solution.








ABSTRACT
Radical isocyanide (isonitrile) insertion reactions have advanced considerably, yet the nature of the underlying paramagnetic intermediates remains poorly understood. We previously studied the isocyanide insertion of muonium (Mu), a light isotope of hydrogen, into 2&#8208;isocyano&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyls by transverse field muon spin rotation (TF&#8208;&#181;SR) spectroscopy and characterized the resulting radical, which was identified as an imidoyl radical. The cyclized product was not observed on the microsecond timescale. To gain deeper insight, we now report TF&#8208;&#181;SR spectra of 1,2&#8208;diisocyano&#8208;3,4,5,6&#8208;tetramethylbenzene in both THF solution and the crystalline state. A single muoniated radical species was observed, displaying an unusually small muon hyperfine coupling constant (hfc). Guided by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we identified this species as a quinoxalinyl radical, formed via intramolecular cyclization of the imidoyl intermediate. This observation implies that the imidoyl radical survives only on the nanosecond timescale before cyclization.

         <title>Rational Construction and Design of CoTi&#8208;NiTi/TNO Species by Pulsed&#8208;Laser Irradiation for Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>

ABSTRACT
Hydrogen is a renewable and environmentally friendly energy carrier and is regarded a viable alternative to fossil fuels. Consequently, developing electrodes with excellent hydrogen evolution electrocatalysis is a top priority in research. In this regard, the CoTi&#8208;NiTi/TNO electrode was synthesized through a single&#8208;step laser method in a nitrogen atmosphere utilizing precursors infused with Co and Ni. Importantly, the CoTi&#8208;NiTi/TNO||IrO2 electrolyzer demonstrated excellent water&#8208;splitting efficiency, reaching a voltage of 1.5&#160;V at a current density of 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 0.5&#160;M H2SO4, surpassing the commercial Pt/C||IrO2 configuration, which only achieved 1.5&#160;V at a current density of 22&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Importantly, the CoTi&#8208;NiTi/TNO||IrO2 displayed a remarkable stability that operated at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for over 48&#160;h without significant decay. The laser&#8208;induced annealing approach offers several advantages. These include the prevention of particle aggregation, an increase in yield, a reduction in processing time, and potentially lower energy consumption.

         <title>Planar and Pyramidal Pentacoordinate Selenium Atoms</title>

         <dc:description>
Planar (D5h) and pyramidal (C5v) dianionic clusters, SeM5X52&#8722; (M = LiK; X = FBr), showcase pentacoordinate selenium atoms stabilized by geometric confinement and electrostatic interactions with surrounding alkali and halogen atoms.








Abstract
A systematic computational exploration of the dianionic systems SeM5X52&#8722; (M&#160;=&#160;Li&#9472;Cs; X&#160;=&#160;F&#9472;I) was conducted to evaluate the viability of planar pentacoordinate selenium (ppSe). Of the twenty combinations considered, 10 adopt planar or pyramidal structures, with four corresponding to true global minima containing a ppSe center. Bonding analysis and magnetic response calculations show that the stabilization of ppSe arrangements in these dianions results mainly from geometric confinement and strong electrostatic interactions between selenium and the surrounding alkali metal and halogen atoms. Unlike planar hypercoordinate systems stabilized by delocalized bonding or aromaticity, the dianions studied here display highly localized electronic structures, expanding the scope of nonclassical bonding motifs in main&#8208;group chemistry.

         <title>Proton Conductive Supramolecular Architectures Based on a Cobalt Terpyridine&#8211;Biimidazole Complex: Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Hexamer and Mixed&#8208;Valence 1D Chain</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded cobalt(II/III) coordination complexes incorporating 2,2&#8242;&#8208;biimidazole and COOH&#8208;terpyridine ligands were synthesized, forming a hexameric cluster [1]6 and a rare mixed&#8208;valence 1D chain [2]n. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks and 1D channels. [1]6 exhibited high proton conductivity (1.0 &#215; 10&#8722;2 S cm&#8722;1, 358 K, 100% RH), showing promise as a proton&#8208;conducting material.








ABSTRACT
Despite extensive research on hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks, cobalt&#8208;based coordination complexes with biimidazole ligands remain largely unexplored, and their potential as proton&#8208;conducting materials has not been comprehensively investigated. Therefore, this paper reports the synthesis, crystal structures, and proton conduction properties of novel hydrogen&#8208;bonded cobalt(II/III) coordination complexes incorporating 2,2&#8242;&#8208;biimidazole (H2bim) and 4&#8242;&#8208;carboxyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8243;&#8208;terpyridine (COOH&#8208;terpy) ligands. Two supramolecular architectures were obtained via ligand exchange reactions in methanol: a hydrogen&#8208;bonded hexamer, {CoIII(COO&#8208;terpy)(H2bim)(SCN)}6 ([1]6), and a mixed&#8208;valence 1D hydrogen&#8208;bonded chain, {[CoII(COO&#8208;terpy)(H2bim)(NCS)][CoIII(COO&#8208;terpy)(H2bim)(SCN)]}n ([2]n). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed that both structures feature extensive hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks involving carboxylate and H2bim ligands, leading to unique porous architectures with 1D channels accommodating lattice solvents. Thermogravimetric and variable&#8208;temperature powder X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses demonstrated the thermal stability and reversible hydration behavior of [1]6. AC impedance measurements under 100% relative humidity revealed high proton conductivity in [1]6, reaching 1.0 &#215; 10&#8722;2 S cm&#8722;1 at 358 K, attributable to proton transport facilitated by hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks and lattice water molecules. Activation energy analysis suggested a vehicle mechanism for proton conduction. Overall, this study highlights the potential of hydrogen&#8208;bonded cobalt complexes incorporating biimidazole ligands as promising proton&#8208;conducting materials with tunable supramolecular architectures.

         <title>Advanced Microsphere and Hydrogel Platforms for Precision Interventional Therapy of Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
Interventional management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains hindered by profound tumor heterogeneity and an immunosuppressive microenvironment. While transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) constitutes the current standard of care, its therapeutic efficacy is compromised by burst drug release, incomplete vascular occlusion, and systemic toxicity. Emerging advanced biomaterial platforms&#8212;microspheres and hydrogels&#8212;are redefining this paradigm by enabling precise spatial and temporal control over embolization and drug delivery. Microspheres provide hierarchical vascular occlusion and sustained release through tunable size and mechanical properties, addressing the limitations of conventional lipiodol formulations. Hydrogels offer exceptional injectability, high payload capacity, and conformal filling of irregular cavities, thereby facilitating controlled intratumoral release and microenvironment modulation. Beyond embolization, these systems integrate seamlessly with multimodal therapies&#8212;including magnetic hyperthermia, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy&#8212;delivering synergistic &#8220;embolization&#8211;therapy&#8211;diagnosis&#8221; functionality. Incorporation of stimuli&#8208;responsive motifs, imaging agents, and immunomodulators further enables localized ablation, reversal of immunosuppression, and induction of systemic antitumor immunity to suppress metastasis and recurrence. Despite encouraging preclinical outcomes, clinical translation faces challenges in biocompatibility, scalable fabrication, and standardized evaluation. This review highlights design strategies for next&#8208;generation embolic materials that integrate precision embolization, multimodal imaging, and immune reprogramming, thereby advancing interventional HCC therapy toward intelligent and personalized solutions.

The Front Cover highlights how countercations modulate diradical properties. A quinonoidal dipyrrolyldiketone boron complex with an orthogonally arranged catechol unit is shown in the dianionic diradical form. Yellow shading indicates spin density and delocalization, whereas a white blurred region denotes steric and electronic effects around the catechol unit. Reduced &#916;EST via catechol introduction and ion pairing is represented by the IESR&#8211;T plot fitted to the Bleaney&#8211;Bowers equation. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Maeda and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202502698).

         <title>Toward Non&#8208;Isocyanate Polyurethanes: Green Synthesis Routes and Recycling Technologies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 65, November 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In light of increasing environmental and regulatory pressures to minimize the use of isocyanates due to their toxicity, this paper comprehensively reviews current advances and future prospects in the synthesis and recycling of NIPUs, focusing on sustainable and environmentally friendly approaches. The review delves into innovative synthesis methodologies for NIPUs, highlighting green pathways while also addressing challenges related to end&#8208;of&#8208;life polyurethane management, with a focus on advancements in chemical recycling technologies.








Abstract
Polyurethanes (PUs) are extensively utilized polymers known for their excellent properties. However, the conventional synthesis of PUs heavily depends on toxic isocyanates, creating significant environmental and health risks. To mitigate these issues, research has increasingly focused on synthesizing non&#8208;isocyanate polyurethanes (NIPUs). This review systematically discusses the primary green synthesis routes for NIPUs: (1) Bis(dialkyl carbonate) route, (2) Transurethanization route, (3) Cyclic carbonate route, and (4) Ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) route. While PUs exhibit superior mechanical and chemical performance, their disposal at the end of life remains a major challenge. Currently, the main recovery methods include chemical degradation (or raw material recycling) and mechanical recycling, with chemical recycling offering potential for a closed&#8208;loop process. This review briefly summarizes these disposal strategies, aiming to encourage sustainable practices. It highlights recent advancements in green synthesis and recycling technologies, focusing on pathways for creating environmentally friendly and recyclable NIPUs. In light of increasing environmental and regulatory pressures to minimize the use of isocyanates due to their toxicity, this paper comprehensively reviews current advances and future prospects in the synthesis and recycling of NIPUs, focusing on sustainable and environmentally friendly approaches. The review delves into innovative synthesis methodologies for NIPUs, highlighting green pathways while also addressing challenges related to end&#8208;of&#8208;life polyurethane management, with a focus on advancements in chemical recycling technologies.

         <title>Toward Ultra&#8208;Narrowband Long&#8208;Wavelength Multiple&#8208;Resonance Emitters: Mechanistic Insights and Design Principles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 65, November 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the narrowband emission with high efficiency, multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence materials are crucial for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. This review provides an overview of the principles behind spectral narrowing in these emitters and also discusses the challenges and future prospects for achieving ultra&#8208;narrowband emission across the full visible spectrum.








Abstract
Multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) material represents a groundbreaking advancement in organic electronics, enabling ultra&#8208;narrowband emission with the enhanced efficiency and spectral accuracy. Leveraging the MR effect, MR&#8208;TADF materials inherently achieve narrow emission profiles that are crucial for High&#8208;definition display. These materials offer a significant advantage over traditional phosphorescence and TADF emitters, which enable high&#8208;performance organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with intrinsically narrow emission spectra. However, realizing full&#8208;color ultra&#8208;narrowband emission is hindered by the intrinsic conflict between spectral tunability and narrowing of the emission bandwidth. Overcoming these challenges requires a deep understanding of the spectral narrowing mechanisms and the integration of precise molecular design strategies that balance efficiency, tunability, and emission purity. This review provides an overview of the principles behind spectral narrowing in boron/nitrogen&#8208;doped MR emitters, including the fundamental mechanisms, quantitative metrics, and recent breakthroughs. It also discusses the challenges and future prospects for achieving ultra&#8208;narrowband emission across the full visible spectrum, offering strategic guidance for the future development of OLED materials with enhanced color purity and performance.

A green synthetic approach to planar hexacyclic indenoisoquinolinoquinolinamides was successfully accomplished via the [3&#160;+&#160;3] and [4&#160;+&#160;2] intramolecular cyclization between ene&#8208;yne&#8208;oxazolones and dihydroisoquinoline under neutral conditions, yielding products in good to excellent quantities. Some of the obtained compounds demonstrated promising anticancer activity against cholangiocarcinoma cells, mimicking those of lamellarins and azalamellarins by promoting apoptosis.








Abstract
A cascade cyclization of polycyclic indenoisoquinolinoquinolinamides has been realized via metal&#8208;free [3&#160;+&#160;3] and [4&#160;+&#160;2] intramolecular cyclization of ene&#8208;yne&#8208;oxazolones and dihydroisoquinoline under neutral conditions in good to excellent yield. In this process, three rings and four bonds are formed with high atom economy under reaction conditions that comply with green chemistry principles. The biological activity of the indenoisoquinolinoquinolinamide analogs, which mimic the structure of lamellarins&#8212;a group of marine natural products&#8212;was evaluated. The results indicated that these indenoisoquinolinoquinolinamide analogs exhibited notable anti&#8208;cancer activity, with cytotoxicity profiles comparable to those of their lamellarin counterparts.

Using the concept of covalent adaptive networks (CANs), or vitrimers, sustainable and reprocessable cross&#8208;linked polymer materials can be developed. Advances in molecular design and understanding of the underlying physics are essential for translating such bond exchange concepts into practical applications. In this study, we demonstrate the design of a simple CAN system via UV&#8208;curing of a thiol&#8208;ene click reaction, where the network is formed by reacting telechelic allyl monomers with tri&#8208;functional thiol cross&#8208;linkers. The telechelic allyl monomer, containing thiourea bonds, is synthesized specifically for this purpose, with thiourea units acting as dynamic bond exchange sites within the network. Notably, this design offers broad tunability in the topological and chemical features, highlighting an important principle in the development of model CANs for physical property investigation. Here, we evaluate curing behavior, temperature&#8208;sweep rheological properties, stress relaxation, and recyclability for a representative formulation, providing insights into simple yet versatile design strategies.

A feature is the use of thiol-ene UV-curing, realized through the synthesis of a diallyl monomer bearing thiourea units.

         <title>Enantiospecific Syntheses of Bicyclic Fragrance Molecules From Verbenone: Enhancing Odour Profiles and Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 65, November 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 6&#8208;step synthetic route has been developed for the synthesis of trans&#8208;fused bicyclic, nor&#8208;polywood derivatives using a ring&#8208;closing metathesis as the key step. These newly synthesized trans&#8208;decalin derivatives exhibited the characteristic woody odor of this class of compounds. The corresponding [6,7] and [6,5] derivatives have also been synthesized to compare their properties with the trans&#8208;decalin derivatives. All the products were obtained with a high degree of chirality starting from (&#8211;)&#8208;verbenone as the chiral pool starting material.








Abstract
Fragrances derived from terpenoid scaffolds continue to play a central role in the design of synthetic odorants, with trans&#8208;fused decalin system providing particularly valuable ambergris like woody notes. Inspired by the structural and stereochemical features of polywood and its analogues, we report herein a concise and versatile synthetic approach to novel bicyclic frameworks from the chiral pool precursor (&#8211;)&#8208;verbenone. An efficient, enantiospecific synthesis of trans&#8208;fused bicyclic fragrance molecules, including nor&#8208;polywood and novel [6,7]&#8208; and [6,5]&#8208;fused analogues, is reported. This six&#8208;step synthetic sequence utilized a powerful combination of conjugate addition, cyclobutane ring&#8208;opening, and a key Ring&#8208;Closing Metathesis (RCM) reactions. Subsequent stereoselective reductions, acetylations, and hydrogenations yield a diverse range of bicyclic frameworks in good overall yields with excellent stereocontrol. Importantly, olfactory evaluation confirms that all synthesized products retain the characteristic woody, amber&#8208;like notes of premium ambergris substitutes. These findings demonstrate the critical influence of ring&#8208;size variation on fragrance properties, providing new insights for the rational design of sophisticated odorants. This work not only provides an efficient synthesis of structurally diverse bicyclic systems but also expands the chemical space of ambergris&#8208;type odorants, offering new insights into structure&#8211;odour relationships for the development of next&#8208;generation woody fragrance ingredients.

An ionic liquid consisting of 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane and tetra&#8208;n&#8208;octylphosphonium ions undergoes a room&#8208;temperature transformation from a paramagnetic liquid to a diamagnetic solid.

Abstract
An ionic liquid consisting of a 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) radical anion and a tetra&#8208;n&#8208;octylphosphonium ion, 1+&#8226;TCNQ&#8226;&#8722;, undergoes a transformation near room temperature from paramagnetic liquid to diamagnetic solid accompanied by significant changes in photophysical properties. A blue solid of 1+&#8226;TCNQ&#8226;&#8722; melts upon heating above 328&#160;K, yielding a green liquid. The green liquid exhibits a magnetic susceptibility of 5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 emu mol&#8722;1. Upon cooling, the liquid retains its paramagnetic properties until the temperature reaches approximately 300&#160;K. Upon further cooling below 300&#160;K, the paramagnetic liquid reverts to the initial blue solid. The solid form of 1+&#8226;TCNQ&#8226;&#8722; exhibits near&#8208;zero magnetic susceptibility. The thermal hysteresis loop with magnetic bistability is observed without decomposition over the temperature range from 300 to 328&#160;K. Crystal structure analysis, electron spin resonance (ESR), and electronic spectra indicate that the drastic changes in magnetic properties are attributable to the reversible &#960;&#8208;dimerization of TCNQ&#8226;&#8722; species during the solid&#8211;liquid/liquid&#8211;solid phase transitions. Additionally, the association/dissociation behaviors of the TCNQ&#8226;&#8722; dimers also induce significant changes in photophysical properties, especially in the short&#8208;wave infrared region (1000&#8211;2500&#160;nm), suggesting the potential application of 1+&#8226;TCNQ&#8226;&#8722; as a bifunctional material.

         <title>Asymmetric Ligand Field Effects in Electron&#8208;Rich Heterometallic Extended Metal Atom Chain Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 65, November 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of multimetallic compounds with modifiable scaffolding ligands raises questions about the distribution of electronic effects in heterometallic systems. Here we investigate the asymmetry of the substituent effects in a modified 2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyradylamine ligand applied to a heterotrimetallic extended metal atom chain (HEMAC) framework. We find that the Mo2 core experiences a stronger effect than the heterometal, counter to expectations based on metal atom electronegativity.








Abstract
In heterometallic systems, electron donation from the ligands may influence the metal atoms in either a symmetric or asymmetric way, with the expected case being that the more electronegative metal is favored. Here, we describe a systematic study of heterometallic compounds where this expectation is not observed. In this study, we use a modification of the symmetric 2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridylamine (dpa) ligand with electron donating ethyl groups, the 4,4&#8242;&#8208;diethyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridylamine ligand (dedpa), to prepare heterometallic extended metal atom chain (HEMAC) complexes with formula Mo2M&#8242;(dedpa)4Cl2 (M&#8242; = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni). The effects of the electron donating substituents were studied through techniques including crystallography, magnetometry, cyclic voltammetry, EPR, M&#246;ssbauer, electronic absorption spectroscopy, and DFT calculations. We find that the new HEMACs are indeed more electron rich, easier to oxidize, and, most interestingly, the impact of the ethyl substituents is not applied equally to all the metals in the chain. The ligand field is stronger at the Mo2 site, but is surprisingly weaker at the M&#8242; center when compared to Mo2M&#8242;(dpa)4Cl2 complexes. We also find that changing the ligand field allows for previously unassigned electronic transitions to become visible, including excitations tentatively assigned to a triplet &#948;&#8208;&#948;* state within the Mo2 unit.

         <title>&#947;&#8208;Cyclodextrin&#8211;Imidazolium Salt&#8208;Based Bioinspired Nanoreactor: Enantioselective Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Arylation of Unprotected Isatin with Arylboronic Acids</title>

The &#947;&#8208;CD&#8211;NHC&#8211;Rh catalyst system was demonstrated to promote the arylation of unprotected isatins with arylboronic acids in aqueous ethanol with high efficiency and enantioselectivity. The enantioselectivity was largely independent of the H2O/ethanol solvent composition ratio, indicating a reaction mechanism involving intramolecular self&#8208;inclusion of the NHC&#8211;Rh complex intermediate within the &#947;&#8208;CD cavity tethered to the NHC ligand.








Abstract
The optically active 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;oxindole skeleton is a promising pharmacophore in drug design and has led to the development of metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reactions using designed chiral ligands for synthesizing 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;oxindoles from isatins (2,3&#8208;oxindoles), 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;2&#8208;oxindoles, and &#945;&#8208;ketoamides. Although the arylation of isatins is vital for convergent synthesis, most studies have used N&#8208;protected isatins, requiring the removal of protecting groups to obtain the desired bioactive products. Despite limited success in the direct high&#8208;enantioselective arylation of unprotected isatins (NH isatins), such arylation holds significant potential for improving atomic and synthetic efficiencies. In aqueous media, cyclodextrins (CDs) with hydrophobic and chiral cavities can selectively include organic compounds, making them potential nanoreactors for asymmetric reactions. In this study, imidazolium salts bearing a &#160;&#947;&#8208;CD were applied as N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands for the Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric arylation of NH isatins in environmentally benign aqueous ethanol. The arylation was successfully achieved in high yield and enantioselectivity using our &#947;&#8208;CD&#8211;NHC&#8211;Rh catalyst. This suggests that the arylation proceeds in the &#947;&#8208;CD cavity (host) through the self&#8208;inclusion of NHC&#9472;Rh complex intermediates (guests). These bio&#8208;inspired transition metal catalysts based on host&#8211;guest linkage systems are expected to contribute significantly to the development of efficient organic synthesis reactions with high enantioselectivity.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Organic Phototheranostics: Matching Rotatable Donors and Shielding Acceptors for Enhanced Imaging and Phototherapy by Stabilized Triplet Excitons and Optimized Radiative Decay</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 65, November 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) organic phototheranostic agents (OPTAs) were constructed by molecular engineering of acceptor shielding and donor rotation. Notably, BPN&#8208;P nanoparticles (NPs) showed high NIR&#8208;II emission, good radical reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and a photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of 63%, achieving superior efficacy in NIR&#8208;II imaging&#8208;guided synergistic photodynamic/photothermal cancer therapy.








Abstract
Second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) organic phototheranostic agents (OPTAs) have received significant interests in cancer treatment by enabling precise positioning of deep&#8208;seated lesions and highly efficient ablation of tumors. However, competition between radiative and nonradiative pathways of the excitons sets great obstacles for obtaining robust OPTAs. Herein, we propose to fabricate high&#8208;performance NIR&#8208;II OPTAs through molecular engineering of acceptor shielding units as well as manipulating molecular conformations by donor rotation. Accordingly, two series of OPTAs (BPN series: 4,4&#8242;&#8208;(ethene&#8208;1,1&#8208;diyl)bis(N,N&#8208;dimethylaniline) as rotatable donor and butadiene as &#960;&#8208;bridge, BPTQ series: julolidine as donor and 2&#8208;vinylthiophene as &#960;&#8208;bridge) with different acceptor shielding units were designed. Photophysical data and theoretical calculations verified the introduction of rotatable donors can help to realize highly twisted molecular conformations, resulting in enhanced NIR&#8208;II emission and photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE). Moreover, the adoption of acceptor shielding units is advantageous for stabilizing triplet excitons for radical reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. As a result, a balance was achieved for BPN&#8208;P nanoparticles (NPs) in the BPN series, which exhibited high NIR&#8208;II emission, good radical ROS generation and highest PCE of 63%. BPN&#8208;P NPs achieved both high&#8208;resolution NIR&#8208;II angiography and imaging&#8208;guided synergistic photodynamic/photothermal cancer treatment in live mice model, showcasing the effectiveness of the strategy.

Abstract
The efficient development of electrocatalysts for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient conditions has been greatly challenging due to the high stability of the N&#8801;N bond and the competitive interference from the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This work innovatively designs a graphitic carbon nitride substrate (g&#8208;C16N19) with a super&#8208;large pore structure based on the self&#8208;doping strategy and first&#8208;principles calculations, and constructs TM@g&#8208;C16N19 (TM&#160;=&#160;Ti &#8764; Au) single&#8208;atom catalyst systems. By establishing a &#8220;Four&#8208;Step&#8221; screening model, it is found that W@g&#8208;C16N19 exhibits the best NRR catalytic performance, with an ultralow limiting potential (UL) of &#8208;0.23&#160;V. Combining electron structure analyses such as charge density difference, ICOHP value, Bader charge, and spin magnetic moment, the micro&#8208;mechanism of W@g&#8208;C16N19 effectively activating the &#963;/&#960; bonds of N2 molecules through strong d&#8208;p orbital hybridization is revealed. Furthermore, based on the pH&#8208; and potential&#8208;dependent adsorption&#8208;free energy results calculated by the constant potential model, pH&#8208;potential coupling analysis shows that the configuration has a decisive influence on activity: the E&#8208;I/S&#8208;V mode dominates in alkaline media, while the E&#8208;O/S&#8208;O pathway is predominant under acidic conditions. In the E&#8208;I configuration, the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step (PDS) of NRR decreases with the decrease of the electrode potential; conversely, the energy barrier of the PDS of NRR in the E&#8208;O/S&#8208;V/S&#8208;O configuration increases with the decrease of the electrode potential.

Helical poly(quinoxaline&#8208;2,3&#8208;diyl) bearing chiral carboxylic acid side chains forms a polycarboxylate that provides an asymmetric and hydrophobic environment in basic water. The polycarboxylate serves as an efficient ligand for copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Diels&#8211;Alder reactions in water, affording chiral products with up to 99% ee. Control experiments suggest the formation of dicarboxylate&#8211;copper complexes via inter&#8208;unit carboxylate coordination.








Abstract
Water&#8208;soluble poly(quinoxaline&#8208;2,3&#8208;diyl)s (PQXlac) bearing chiral carboxylic acid side chains derived from l&#8208;lactic acid were used for Cu&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Diels&#8211;Alder reaction in water. The reaction of azachalcone with cyclopentadiene in the presence of PQXlac (1000mer, 1 mol% monomer unit) and Cu(NO3)2 (1 mol% Cu) proceeded at 5&#160;&#176;C in good yield with high enantioselectivity up to 99% ee. The utilization of the corresponding oligomers shorter than 10mer resulted in low chemical yield with low enantioselectivity, suggesting that a tight helical structure is essential for the formation of an effective catalyst. A comparison of the random and block copolymer of PQXlac and PQXteg, which has achiral tetra(ethylene glycol) side chains, indicated that block copolymer, in which the carboxylate groups are more densely packed, showed higher chemical yields along with higher enantioselectivity. These results suggest that the active catalyst has a copper dicarboxylate structure in which two carboxylate groups on every other monomer unit coordinate to the Cu center to form an effective chiral reaction environment.

         <title>Ion&#8208;Pairing&#8208;Modulated Diradical Properties in Partially Conjugated Negatively Charged &#960;&#8208;Electronic Systems</title>

A quinonoidal dipyrrolyldiketone boron complex with an orthogonally arranged catechol unit in the dianionic form exhibited diradical properties, as observed from the singlet&#8211;triplet energy gaps (&#916;EST) that were modulated by coexisting countercations. &#916;EST values were controlled by the bridging boron moieties in the dianion diradicals.








Abstract
A quinonoidal dipyrrolyldiketone catecholate&#8208;boron complex, with two pyrrole&#8208;quinonemethide moieties bridged by a six&#8208;membered cross&#8208;conjugated unit, was synthesized to modulate the diradical character of the dianion formed upon deprotonation. The dianionic species exhibited near&#8208;infrared absorption and electron spin resonance (ESR) signals, confirming the diradical properties. Variable&#8208;temperature (VT) ESR spectra suggest the thermal excitation from the ground&#8208;state singlet diradical to the triplet diradical, providing singlet&#8211;triplet energy gaps modulated by coexisting cations and bridging boron moieties.

         <title>Dual Excited&#8208;State Charge&#8208;Transfer Process in Luminescent Radicals with Spatially Folded Arrangement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 65, November 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report four donor&#8211;acceptor structured luminescent radicals in which spatial folding between carbazole and radical units induces a unique dual excited&#8208;state CT process involving both TBCT and TSCT. Systematic photophysical studies combined with theoretical calculations elucidate how these two CT pathways influence the emissive behaviors of the radicals.








Abstract
The through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) mechanism has attracted significant attention in closed&#8208;shell organic luminescent materials due to its strong environmental sensitivity, small singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap, and high exciton utilization efficiency. However, open&#8208;shell luminescent radicals mostly adopt D&#8211;A or D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A skeletons to overcome the dark&#8208;state limitations of radicals, relying solely on a through&#8208;bond charge transfer (TBCT) process. To date, TSCT excited states in radical systems remain largely unexplored. In this study, we report the coexistence of TSCT and TBCT mechanisms in radical molecules. Four luminescent radicals (TB&#8208;MR, TB&#8208;DR, TBS&#8208;MR, and TBS&#8208;DR) were systematically investigated using absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations. The results reveal that the spatially folded conformation between carbazole units and radical centers in the TBS series induces abnormal photophysical behaviors deviating from conventional paradigms. Further electron&#8211;hole analysis indicates that the TBS series exhibits a dual excited&#8208;state charge transfer (CT) mechanism, with TSCT and TBCT contributions of approximately 70% and 30%, respectively. This discovery not only elucidates the influence of multiple CT processes on the excited&#8208;state behaviors of luminescent radicals but also establishes a novel excited&#8208;state engineering strategy for tuning the luminescence of open&#8208;shell systems.

         <title>Synthetic Mimics of Serine Proteases via Covalent Imprinting of Photo&#8208;Protected Template Molecules for Aryl Amide Hydrolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2&#8208;Aminobenzyl alcohol in solution uses its more nucleophilic amino group to react with an activated ester in the transacylation. Only inside a custom&#8208;designed active site do the same functional groups mimic serine protease by catalytically hydrolyzing not only activated esters but also aryl amides with substrate selectivity.








ABSTRACT
The rational design of enzyme&#8208;mimicking catalysts remains in its early stages. Beyond the controversies surrounding the origin of the catalytic efficiency found in enzyme catalysis, a large challenge lies in the synthetic construction of multifunctional active sites with precisely positioned binding and catalytic groups. Here, we present a rational strategy to create serine protease&#8208;mimicking molecularly imprinted nanoparticles (MINPs) via covalent imprinting within cross&#8208;linkable micelles, followed by photo&#8208;deprotection of the polymerized template molecules. Unlike previously reported protease mimics that work on activated ester substrates, the MINP&#8208;based catalysts are able to hydrolyze aryl amides under mild conditions. In addition, substrate selectivity can be finely tuned through the modular design of the template molecules.

         <title>Enhancing G&#8208;Quadruplex Binding: Rational Design and Biophysical Evaluation of Dimeric Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescence thermal shift assays, electrospray ionization&#8208;mass spectrometry, CD spectroscopy, molecular modeling and cytotoxicity assays were enrolled to study the binding of a rationally designed anthraquinone&#8208;based G&#8208;quadruplex binder interacting with the nucleic acid as a molecular tweezer.








ABSTRACT
G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) are non&#8208;canonical nucleic acid structures formed by guanine&#8208;rich sequences. Within the human genome, beyond telomeres, G4 motifs have also been found in promoters, implying a potential role in gene regulation that could be achieved through interactions with small&#8208;molecule ligands. In this field, anthraquinone represented a privileged scaffold for the design of G4&#8208;targeting molecules. Additionally, emerging evidence proved that compounds bearing two aromatic cores can offer enhanced affinity and selectivity toward G4s due to cooperative binding in a tweezer&#8208;like fashion. This study reports the rational design and synthesis of anthraquinone&#8208;based building blocks conceived to generate a dimeric ligand connected through a flexible polyethylene glycol (PEG) linker to potentially recognize G4 as molecular tweezers. The interaction of the synthesized compounds with G4 structures has been investigated by biophysical techniques, including fluorescence thermal shift assays, electrospray ionization&#8208;mass spectrometry and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, supported by molecular modeling studies. Finally, cytotoxicity assays were performed to evaluate the antiproliferative effects of the new ligands.

         <title>Biocatalytic Strategies for the Synthesis of Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atropisomeric scaffolds are important building blocks in natural products, organocatalysts, metal ligands, and functional materials. This review introduces current developments for synthesizing atropisomers employing biocatalytic kinetic resolution, dynamic kinetic resolution, and desymmetrization strategies.








ABSTRACT
The asymmetric synthesis of atropisomers has garnered extensive attention in recent years. Atropisomers constitute a key structural motif in natural products, chiral ligands, organocatalysts, and functional materials. Despite progress driven by transition&#8208;metal and organocatalysis, inherent limitations in enantioselectivity and sustainability have hampered further development in this field. Alternatively, biocatalysis offers a promising solution employing strategies including (dynamic) kinetic resolution, desymmetrization, and other strategies. These biocatalytic processes operate under mild, environmentally friendly conditions, achieving high stereoselectivity that is often difficult to attain with traditional methods. This review highlights recent advances in the biocatalytic synthesis of atropisomers and offer insights in the development of the relevant field.

         <title>Delivery Routes of Topical Eyedrops Reaching the Posterior Segment of the Eye&#8208;Recent Advances</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizs recent advances in topical eyedrop therapies for ocular fundus diseases, with a focus on their delivery routes and mechanisms by which they reach the posterior segment of eye.The formulations based on the corneal route include emulsomes and dual&#8208;transmembrane peptides, those based on the conjunctival route include PepT&#8208;1 ligands and cell&#8208;penetrating peptides, and those based on dual routes include chitosan, polymer micelles and supramolecular peptides.








ABSTRACT
Current topical eyedrop treatments for posterior segment diseases face significant challenges, including rapid tear clearance and ocular barrier limitations, which hinder effective drug delivery to target tissues in the posterior segment. To date, no eyedrop formulation has been clinically approved for the treatment of ocular fundus diseases. Eyedrops reach the posterior segment via two primary routes: the corneal route and the conjunctival routes, the latter comprising the conjunctival&#8211;vasculature route and the conjunctival&#8211;scleral route. This review summarizes recent advances in topical eyedrop therapies for ocular fundus diseases, with a focus on their delivery routes and the mechanisms by which they reach the posterior segment of eye. The cell&#8208;penetrating homing peptides and lipid nanoparticle&#8208;encapsulated eyedrops primarily reach the posterior segment via the corneal route; cell&#8208;penetrating peptides and PepT&#8208;1&#8208;targeting ligands mainly utilize the conjunctival route; whereas chitosan nanoparticles, polymeric micelles, and supramolecular peptide&#8208;based eyedrops can access the posterior segment via both routes. By systematically clarifying the pathways and mechanisms by which eyedrops formulations traverse ocular barriers, this review aims to provide a rational foundation for future research and development in posterior segment drug delivery.

         <title>Structural Control of RNA Demethylation: G&#8208;Quadruplex Proximity Suppresses ALKBH5 Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
RNA G&#8208;quadruplex structures significantly affected the m6A demethylation activity of the RNA demethylase, ALKBH5. The suppression was apparent when m6A was near G&#8208;tetrad cores, and not within the flexible loops. The G&#8208;quadruplex ligand induced G&#8208;quadruplex structure to RNA and suppressed ALKBH5 demethylation activity to nearby m6A. These results suggest that G&#8208;quadruplex RNA serves as a regulatory element in epitranscriptome regulation.








ABSTRACT
RNA modifications and higher&#8208;order structures function as regulatory layers of RNA metabolism beyond sequence context. However, their interplay remains largely unexplored. Among RNA modifications, N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant internal modification in mRNAs, regulated by writer, reader, and eraser proteins; the AlkB family dioxygenases, AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5), and fat mass&#8208; and obesity&#8208;associated protein (FTO). In addition, G&#8208;quadruplex RNA is a representative structure involved in key biological processes. This study investigated how G&#8208;quadruplex structures influence the demethylation efficiency of m6A erasers. Using RNAs with m6A positioned adjacent to the G&#8208;tetrad core or within a flexible loop of G&#8208;quadruplex structures, we showed that G&#8208;quadruplex formation markedly suppressed ALKBH5 activity compared with FTO, particularly when m6A was near the G&#8208;tetrad core, such as the HIV&#8208;1 U3&#8208;region G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;forming sequence. Conversely, m6A within a long, flexible loop, remained accessible to ALKBH5. The G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;specific ligand BRACO19, which stabilizes G&#8208;quadruplex structures, further confirmed the structural sensitivity of ALKBH5. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate a direct link between G&#8208;quadruplex structures and m6A eraser protein activity. These findings highlight the importance of the RNA structural context in regulating m6A erasers and suggest that G&#8208;quadruplexes may serve as regulatory elements in epitranscriptomic control.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific OaAEP1 Mediated Functional Proteins Immobilization on Magnetic Nanoparticles and the Recyclings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
Precise and stable immobilization of proteins on nanoparticle surfaces is essential for advancing applications in biocatalysis, biosensing, and synthetic biology. However, conventional immobilization strategies often suffer from nonspecific binding, random orientation, and loss of biological activity. Here, a chemically defined, site&#8208;specific protein conjugation strategy is developed using the peptide ligase OaAEP1 to catalyze ligation between N&#8208;terminal Gly&#8208;Leu (GL) and C&#8208;terminal Asn&#8208;Gly&#8208;Leu (NGL) motifs. This approach enables controlled&#8208;orientation and high&#8208;efficiency immobilization of functional proteins and enzymes on Fe3O4 and Fe3O4@SiO2 magnetic nanoparticles. Fluorescent proteins and catalytically active enzymes, including TEV (Tobacco Etch Virus) protease and Taq polymerase, retain activity and recyclability following conjugation. Sequential ligation permits programmable multimeric assembly. This enzymatic platform provides a robust, reusable, and modular route to construct functional protein&#8208;nanoparticle interfaces with broad implications for nanobiotechnology and protein engineering.

         <title>Porous Organic Polymer Constructed From Thiazolo&#8208;Thiazole and Cyclophosphazene as a Heterogeneous Photocatalyst for Visible Light&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Isatins, Thiocyanoindoles, and Thiocyanoanilines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous organic polymer (POP), constructed based on hexaaryloxycyclophosphazene and thiazolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazole building blocks, is demonstrated as a visible light&#8211;driven, metal&#8208;free heterogeneous photocatalyst for oxidation of indoles to isatins and thiocyanation of indoles and anilines under mild conditions.








Abstract
A porous organic polymer (POP) based on hexakis(4&#8208;formylphenoxy)cyclophosphazene (HFCP), that is, HFCPTzPOP, was synthesized by condensation reaction with dithiooxamide. The polymer is shown to exhibit excellent visible light absorption, enabling its application as a heterogeneous photocatalyst for the conversion of indoles to isatins and 3&#8208;thiocyanoindoles, and selective thiocyanation of anilines at the para position. The photocatalytic reactions occur under mild conditions in oxygen atmosphere without the addition of any toxic metal or oxidizing agent. HFCPTzPOP acts as a photoredox catalyst in oxidative transformations, converting molecular oxygen into singlet oxygen (1O2) and superoxide radical anion (O2&#8226;&#8211;) through energy transfer and electron transfer processes, respectively. It is shown that the photocatalyst can be easily recycled up to 10 cycles without any loss of catalytic activity.

         <title>Diastereoselective Access to 3&#8208;Aminoindanones Through Domino Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
A unique intermolecular approach for stereoselective synthesis of 3&#8208;aminoindanones bearing a &#946;&#8208;quaternary carbon from 2&#8208;alkynylacetophenones and anilines has been reported. The catalytic system comprised of silver salt and phosphoric acid effectively transformed a range of 2&#8208;alkynylacetophenones and anilines to corresponding 3&#8208;aminoindanones in moderate to good yields with excellent diastereoselectivity and broad functional group tolerance. Furthermore, scale up and synthetic transformations were carried out to demonstrate the synthetic utility of the developed protocol.

         <dc:description>
The family of template&#8208;assembled synthetic G&#8208;quartets, or TASQs, comprises different molecular tools that have been successfully used to decipher G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) biology (via optical imaging and/or affinity precipitation). The synthetic access to the different TASQs has been thoroughly revisited herein to make it simpler and more efficient thanks to a convergent strategy that relies on an unprecedented key common intermediate.

Precise insights into the biology of DNA and RNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) were obtained thanks to the use of ever more versatile G4&#8208;interacting molecules (or G4 ligands), which bear additional moieties making them functionalizable in situ (i.e., while in interaction with cellular G4s) thanks to bioorthogonal chemistry. We recently reported on a series of biomimetic G4 ligands known as TASQs (for template&#8208;assembled synthetic G&#8208;quartets) whose multifunctionality was exploited to visualize (pre&#8208;targeted and in situ click imaging) and identify cellular G4s (G4omics and Chem&#8208;CLIP). We report herein on a novel synthetic strategy that makes multivalent TASQs readily accessible and opens brand new perspectives for the design of ever smarter molecular tools to unravel the quite complex G4 biology in a more accurate, straightforward, and simpler manner.

&lt;p&gt;The family of template-assembled synthetic G-quartets, or TASQs, comprises different molecular tools that have been successfully used to decipher G-quadruplex (G4) biology (&lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; optical imaging and/or affinity precipitation). The synthetic access to the different TASQs has been thoroughly revisited herein to make it simpler and more efficient thanks to a convergent strategy that relies on an unprecedented key common intermediate.

         <title>New Phosphoranylideneketenes and Phosphoranylidenethioketenes&#8208;Synthesis, Structure, Spectroscopy, and Lewis Base Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of structurally and electronically diverse phosphoranylideneketenes (R3PCCO) and phosphoranylidenethioketenes (R3PCCS) were synthesized and comprehensively characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray&#8208;crystallography, 13C NMR, and IR spectroscopy. Despite acting as relatively weak ambidentate Lewis donors, these compounds readily form stable adducts with strong Lewis acids.








Abstract
Posphoranylideneketene Ph3PCCO and its sulfur analogue, Ph3PCCS, are cumulated ylides that exhibit diverse reactivity and distinct structural features. Herein, we present the first systematic study of substituent effects on the structures and bonding of a series of aryl&#8208; and alkyl&#8208;substituted phosphoranylideneketenes, R3PCCO [R = Et, cyclohexyl, NMe2, 4&#8208;Me2N&#8208;C6H4, 4&#8208;MeO&#8208;C6H4, 4&#8208;CF3&#8208;C6H4, 3,5&#8208;(CF3)2&#8208;C6H3], prepared from the corresponding phosphonium salts, [R3PCH2COOEt]X (X = Br, I) and two equivalents of Na[N(SiMe3)2]. Multinuclear NMR and IR spectroscopy, supported by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, revealed that the bond strength within the central P&#9552;C&#9552;C&#9552;O fragment increases with the electron&#8208;deficiency of the aryl substituents at phosphorus. The corresponding phosphoranylidenethioketenes, R3PCCS (R = Et, cyclohexyl, NMe2, 4&#8208;Me2N&#8208;C6H4, 4&#8208;MeO&#8208;C6H4, 4&#8208;CF3&#8208;C6H4), were obtained by reactions of R3PCCO with CS2. The rate of conversion of R3PCCO into R3PCCS decreases with increasing electron deficiency at phosphorus. Both R3PCCO and R3PCCS act as relatively weak ambidentate Lewis donors, yet they form stable acid&#8208;base adducts with strong Lewis acids such as B(C6F5)3 and Al(C6F5)3.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of the Tricyclic Core of Daphniphyllum Alkaloid Daphnilongeranin B via Oxidative Nazarov Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Employing the oxidative Nazarov reaction, the [7,5,5]&#8208;tricyclic core of the&#160;Daphniphyllum&#160;alkaloid daphnilongeranin B was facilely synthesized from cycloheptenone in seven steps.








ABSTRACT
Daphniphyllum alkaloid daphnilongeranin B presents synthetic challenges due to its congested hexacyclic skeleton, seven stereogenic centers, and two vicinal quaternary centers. Recently, we discovered a series of TEMPO+BF4&#8722;&#8208;promoted Nazarov reactions and demonstrated their value in the synthesis of five&#8208;membered ring&#8208;containing small molecules and structurally complex natural products. Herein, we report a concise synthesis of its [7&#8208;5&#8208;5] tricyclic core via a 7&#8208;step approach, using commercially available, inexpensive cycloheptenone as the starting material. Key transformations include a Babler&#8208;Dauben rearrangement, an intramolecular aldol condensation, and a pivotal TEMPO&#8314;BF4&#8722;&#8208;mediated oxidative Nazarov reaction via an easily synthesized, unfunctionalized tertiary divinyl carbinol (TDC). These results showcase the utility of our mild Nazarov methodology and lay the foundation for the total synthesis of daphnilongeranin B.

         <title>Red and Orange&#8208;Light&#8208;Accelerated Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Olefination of Arenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;wavelength visible&#8208;light&#8208;accelerated Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed olefination of arenes bearing anilides is reported. The method operates without an external photosensitizer or short&#8208;wavelength blue light. Rh(III) hydride intermediate is oxidized with oxygen in the excited state by absorbing long&#8208;wavelength visible light, improving catalytic efficiency.








ABSTRACT
Transition metal (TM)&#8208;catalyzed photoreactions have emerged as powerful tools for synthesizing products that are challenging to obtain under conventional thermal conditions. However, most protocols rely on short&#8208;wavelength visible light, such as purple or blue light (&lt;500&#160;nm). Although long&#8208;wavelength light (&gt;500&#160;nm) allows for milder conditions, higher chemical selectivity, and deep light penetration, its application in single TM&#8208;catalyzed photocatalytic systems is rare. Herein, we present the long&#8208;wavelength visible&#8208;light&#8208;accelerated Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed olefination of arenes bearing an anilide moiety as a directing group. This methodology circumvents the use of external photosensitizers and short&#8208;wavelength blue light, owing to the use of a cationic Rh(III) complex. Experimental and computational analyses suggest that the Rh(III) complex initially acts as a C&#9472;H activation catalyst, and oxidation of the generated Rh(III) hydride intermediate by oxygen is accelerated by absorption of long&#8208;wavelength visible light (&gt; 500&#160;nm).

         <title>Effective Strategies on Fabricating Photoelectrode Materials for Enhancing Photoelectrochemical Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designing and constructing highly active photoelectrodes is key to improving the performance of PEC sensor. A variety of signal enhancement strategies have been employed on fabricating effective photoelectrode materials, including constructing heterojunctions, modifying cocatalysts, doping elements, and surface sensitization to achieve excellent sensing performance of PEC analysis platforms.








Abstract
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensors, as a rapidly developing and highly promising method for detection and analysis, show the advantages of low background noise and high sensitivity by virtue of the separate &#8220;photoexcitation&#8208;electrical detection signal&#8221; mode. It is attracting increasing attention in fields such as environmental monitoring and pharmaceutical analysis. The working mechanism of PEC sensor is recording the change of electrical signals caused by the recognition reaction between the measured substance and the photoelectrode. The photoresponsive materials on electrodes play a central role in the conversion of light into electrical signal, and it can directly affect the sensitivity of the sensor element. Designing and constructing highly active photoelectrode is key to improve the performance of PEC sensor, but it also presents significant challenges. Based on the above, this paper reviews a variety of electrical signal enhancement strategies through fabricating effective photoelectrode materials, such as constructing heterojunctions, modifying cocatalysts, doping elements, and sensitization of quantum dots, etc., aiming to provide valuable solutions to achieving excellent sensing performance of PEC analysis platforms. Finally, some future opportunities and challenges of PEC sensors are also discussed.

         <title>Synthesis and Electrolyte Study of Lithium Bis(perfluorinated pinacolato)Borate for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work showcases the synthesis of lithium bis(perfluorinated pinacolato)borate and investigates its application as an electrolyte salt for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The synthesized salts give improved air and thermal stability compared to conventionally used lithium hexafluorophosphate. Long&#8208;term battery cycling followed by an electrolyte degradation study has been performed.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries are the leading rechargeable battery technology. 1 M lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) dissolved in carbonate solvents is commonly used as the electrolyte; however, LiPF6 is hygroscopic and forms toxic HF in the presence of water. This work presents the synthesis of lithium bis(perfluorinated pinacolato)borate salts Li[B(pp)2]&#183;xDME (x&#160;=&#160;0 or 1, pp&#160;=&#160;perfluorinated pinacolato, O2C2(CF3)4), which exhibit superior air tolerance and have higher thermal stability than LiPF6. Lithium&#8208;ion cycling using 1 M Li[B(pp)2]&#183;DME and 0.2 M Li[B(pp)2] electrolyte salts was performed, where 0.2 M Li[B(pp)2] cycled with higher capacity than 1 M Li[B(pp)2]&#183;DME. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy on the post&#8208;cycled NMC cathode found a thicker cathode electrolyte interphase with less LiF when using Li[B(pp)2]&#183;DME than for LiPF6 based electrolyte.

         <title>Deazaalloxazines &#8211; Flavin Derivatives That Provide Reductive Photoredox Catalysis with Inert Substrates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
7,8&#8208;Dimethoxy&#8208;5&#8208;aryl&#8208;5&#8208;deazaalloxazines (dAll) are new class of photostable, visible&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing flavin derivatives which are strongly reducible upon excitation with 400&#160;nm light. It was demonstrated on difficult&#8208;to&#8208;reduce aryl halides like bromo&#8208;, chloro&#8208; and fluoroanisoles which were transformed to phosphonates by reductive cross&#8208;coupling with trimethyl phosphite or on desulfonylation of sulfonamides to free amines by S&#9472;N bond cleavage.








Abstract
Reductive transformations of substances that are difficult to reduce continue to pose challenges for photoredox catalysis. Promising photoreduction catalysts include flavin and deazaflavin derivatives; however, even their reductive abilities are limited for the range of substrates considered &#8220;inert&#8221;. In this work, we present 5&#8208;deazaalloxazines, a new group of deazaflavin analogues that are predisposed to catalyze reductions due to their low reduction potential (down to &#8722;1.65&#160;V vs. SCE) even in the ground state. We studied three series of 5&#8208;deazaalloxazines ([i] 5&#8208;unsubstituted, [ii] 5&#8208;aryldeazaalloxazines, and [iii] 5&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;5&#8208;deazaalloxazines) to determine their photophysical and electrochemical properties and their ability to participate in model photoreduction reactions. From 31 compounds, we selected 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;7,8&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;5&#8208;(o&#8208;tolyl)&#8208;5&#8208;deazaalloxazine [3a(o&#8208;MePh)], as it showed, among other things, the highest efficiency in photodehalogenation of p&#8208;fluoroanisole and was photostable and absorbed in the visible light region, thereby allowing photoreactions using a 400&#160;nm LED. Practical applicability was demonstrated in the C&#9472;P coupling reaction of electron&#8208;rich aryl halides (including chloroanisoles and p&#8208;fluoroanisole) with trimethyl phosphite, providing an arylation reaction to form dimethyl arylphosphonates, and in the release/deprotection of amines from the corresponding tosyl and triflylamides.

         <title>Intertwined Processes in the Pummerer&#8208;Type Rearrangement Affording &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethoxylated Thioethers and the Corresponding Highly Enantioenriched Sulfoxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly stereoenriched &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethoxylated sulfoxides were accessed from racemic aryl methyl sulfoxides, by means of a trifluoromethoxylative Pummerer rearrangement and a highly enantioselective sulfoxidation. The 2&#8208;step procedure could be performed in one pot. The mechanism of the rearrangement and the properties of the desired sulfoxides were studied, paving the way for an alternative access to controlled trifluoromethoxylated stereocenters.








Abstract
A method to access racemic or highly stereoenriched &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethoxylated sulfoxides through the Pummerer rearrangement of aryl methyl sulfoxides followed by the oxidation of the resulting trifluoromethoxylated sulfides is described. Among the three reagents selected as both rearrangement activators and F3CO&#8211; anion sources, 2,4&#8208;dinitro&#8208;1&#8208;(trifluoromethoxy)benzene (DNTFB) was found to be the most effective. In each case, the OCF3&#8208;source was shown to play diverse key roles in the rearrangement. Enantioenriched trifluoromethoxy&#8208;sulfoxides (up to 95% enantiomeric excess) were obtained using an oxaziridinium salt derived from cholesterol.&#160;The configurational stability of these sulfoxides was investigated by thermal enantiomerization followed by enantioselective chromatography. Finally, the acidity of the protons in &#945;&#8208;position of the sulfinyl group was determined in DMSO (pKa value 20.3) suggesting the potency of this new scaffold for preparing trifluoromethoxylated trisubstituted C&#8208;sp3 centers via a deprotonation/alkylation sequence.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An environmentally benign and general protocol for intermolecular benzylic C(sp3)&#9472;H amination under mild, catalyst&#8208;free, and cost&#8208;effective conditions is reported, eliminating the long&#8208;standing reliance on transition metals, photoelectrochemical systems, and stoichiometric oxidants.








Abstract
We present an environmentally benign and efficient strategy for the direct amination of benzylic C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds. This method operates under metal&#8208;free, photocatalyst&#8208;free, and oxidant&#8208;free conditions. Notably, the protocol demonstrates exceptional functional group tolerance and scalability, enabling gram&#8208;scale synthesis and late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex drug&#8208;like molecules.

         <title>Nanocatalysis for Green Synthesis of Functionalized Benzofurans</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanocatalysis has been emerged as a sustainable green synthetic approach for the synthesis of organic compounds. The present manuscript demonstrates the development of functionalized benzofuran by using various NPs. Moreover, the mechanistic part of nanocatalysis also have been discussed.








Abstract
Due to vivid challenges for the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds such as maximizing efficiency, high yield, controlled&#8208; stereochemistry, high purity, and ecofriendly synthetic methods, nanomaterials, and nanocatalysis have gained much attention as highly efficient alternatives to conventional materials. Herein, the development of functionalized benzofuran by using sustainable green synthetic approaches, for instance, nanomaterial&#8208;based catalysis in presence of novel metal nanoparticles (NPs), bimetallic NPs, graphene&#8208;supported metals, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), and porous organic polymers (POPs) have been demonstrated.

     alt="Nanocatalysis for Green Synthesis of Functionalized Benzofurans"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanocatalysis has been emerged as a sustainable green synthetic approach for the synthesis of organic compounds. The present manuscript demonstrates the development of functionalized benzofuran by using various NPs. Moreover, the mechanistic part of nanocatalysis also have been discussed.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to vivid challenges for the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds such as maximizing efficiency, high yield, controlled- stereochemistry, high purity, and ecofriendly synthetic methods, nanomaterials, and nanocatalysis have gained much attention as highly efficient alternatives to conventional materials. Herein, the development of functionalized benzofuran by using sustainable green synthetic approaches, &lt;i&gt;for instance&lt;/i&gt;, nanomaterial-based catalysis in presence of novel metal nanoparticles (NPs), bimetallic NPs, graphene-supported metals, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), and porous organic polymers (POPs) have been demonstrated. Moreover, the role of nanomaterials, mechanistic approaches during the catalysis and advantages of nanocatalysis over conventional methods have also been discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cyclic Tetraindoles With a Cyclooctatetraene Core: Controlling Planarity and Antiaromatic Character via N&#8208;Alkylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report cyclic tetraindole derivatives incorporating a central cyclooctatetraene (COT) ring, where molecular distortion is tuned by N&#8208;alkylation. Increasing planarity through ethylene linkers enhances &#960;&#8208;conjugation and antiaromaticity, accompanied by red&#8208;shifted absorption, lower oxidation potentials, and a reduced HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, providing insights into structure&#8208;property relationships in antiaromatic &#960;&#8208;systems.








Abstract
Cyclooctatetraene (COT), a representative 4n &#960;&#8208;electronic system, typically exhibits nonaromatic character in highly twisted structures, but planarization significantly alters its electronic properties, increasing antiaromaticity. Therefore, investigations on the structure&#8208;property relationships of COT derivatives are essential for the development of future functional materials. In this study, we have developed a series of cyclic tetraindoles possessing a central COT ring. The degree of molecular distortion can be controlled by N&#8208;alkylation. Specifically, substitution of the N&#8208;butyl groups increased the distortion, while the structural fixation by ethylene linkers enhanced its planarity. As planarity increased, a noticeable red&#8208;shift in the absorption wavelength, a decrease in oxidation potential, and a reduction in the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap were observed. These results can be attributed to the more effective conjugation of the COT ring with increased planarity, which led to an enhancement of the antiaromaticity.

         <title>Enhanced i&#8208;Motif Stability through Consecutive 2&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;Difluorocytidine Incorporation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gemcitabine (dFdC) is a unique nucleoside containing two fluorine atoms at the 2&#8242;&#8208;position. Using circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we discovered that consecutive dFdC confer remarkable thermal and pH i&#8208;motif stability. In particular, the molecular surface of the fully modified human vertebrate i&#8208;motif structure shows the confluence of the fluorine atoms in green, which contributes to the overall stabilisation.








Abstract
Chemical modifications of nucleic acids are widely used to tune stability and functionality in therapeutic and nanotechnological applications. Among these, fluorinated cytidine derivatives such as 2&#8242;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;arabinocytidine (2&#8242;F&#8208;araC) and 2&#8242;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;ribocytidine (2&#8242;F&#8208;riboC) have been shown to influence i&#8208;motif structures differently, with 2&#8242;F&#8208;araC strongly stabilizing and 2&#8242;F&#8208;riboC exerting a mildly deleterious effect. In this study, we investigate the impact of gemcitabine (2&#8242;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;difluorocytidine, dFdC) on i&#8208;motif stability. dFdC exhibits small effects in single or double substituted sequences, but a pronounced stabilization when multiple consecutive residues are incorporated. Thermal and pH&#8208;dependent analyses demonstrate that sequences containing fully substituted dFdC maintain i&#8208;motif folding at neutral pH and show enhanced thermal stability. Structural insights suggest that this stabilization arises from a combination of factors, such as hyperconjugative interactions, hydrogen bonding, and dipole alignment, while the adaptable sugar conformation mitigates destabilizing minor groove contacts observed in other more rigid modifications, such as 2&#8242;&#8208;F&#8208;riboC. Cooperative interactions among adjacent dFdC residues and potential changes in hydration may play a key factor in reinforcing stability. These results highlight the unique capacity of dFdC to enhance i&#8208;motif robustness and suggest that strategically placed difluoro substitutions can be exploited to design i&#8208;motifs with improved stability, expanding their potential in biotechnology and therapeutic applications.

         <title>To What Extent a Synthetic Strategy Can Influence the Structure, Molecular Dynamics, and Biological Properties of Cyclic Tryptophan Cage Miniproteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Cyclic peptides are a powerful class of compounds with significant applications in both bio&#8208;logical research and medical therapy. Most of the known cyclic peptides of therapeutic importance are isolated from natural sources. In this paper, we show how the first&#8208;order structure of a precursor containing exactly the same amino acids sequence, but organized in the opposite order after macrocyclization, can alter the physicochemical properties.








Abstract
This paper presents structural and biological studies of two cyclic oligopeptides obtained as a result of macrocyclization of linear precursors containing the same amino acid composition, but arranged in reverse order. The first of them with an amino acid sequence (G1D2A3Y4A5Q6W7L8A9D10G11G12P13S14S15G16R17P18P19P20S21G22&#8208;) belongs to a group of oligopeptides known in the literature as Tryptophan Cage (Trp_C), often used as models to test and understand the mechanism of protein folding. The knowledge about second precursor (&#8208;G1S2P3P4P5R6G7S8S9P10G11G12D13A14L15W16Q17A18 Y19A20D21G22&#8208;) is not so extensive. The cyclic forms of both compounds labeled as cTrp_C and Inv&#8208;cTrp_C were studied by mass spectrometry (ESI MS and ESI MS/MS), electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy. ECD and NMR measurements were performed in a different solvents and a wide temperature range. The experimental data clearly demonstrated differences in thermal stability and conformational changes for the two samples. The nature and mechanism of these changes were investigated by means of Molecular Dynamics calculations. Theoretical studies have shown that for cTrp_C and Inv&#8208;cTrp_C the length and structure of the &#945;$\alpha$&#8208;helix, which is the core stabilizing the geometry of cyclic oligopeptides, are different. In the case of Inv&#8208;cTrp_C, two edge models with a indole ring of tryptophan (W16) inside the cage (Inv&#8208;cTrp_C1) and outside the cage (Inv&#8208;cTrp_C2) are postulated. Based on theoretical calculations, it is speculated that the formation of these two structures is due to the large&#8208;amplitude reorientation of the unstructured chain around the &#945;$\alpha$&#8208;helix.

         <title>Sc(III) Complexes of Pyclen Derivative Ligands as Probes for Hypoxia: Synthesis, Chemical Characterization, 44Sc&#8208;Radiolabeling, and Preclinical Assessment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hypoxia&#8208;sensitive nitroimidazole&#8208;functionalized pyclen derivatives were successfully synthesized and radiolabeled with 44Sc(III), affording stable and inert scandium complexes. Remarkable Sc(III)&#8208;binding capabilities of the PC2A&#8208;mono(amide) platform enabled excellent radiolabeling performance, with &#8805;92&#8211;99% yields and &#8805;99% radiochemical purity. MicroPET studies confirmed efficient tumor accumulation, with the PC2A&#8208;Ph&#8208;NI derivative exhibiting superior biodistribution and tumor&#8208;to&#8208;background ratios, highlighting its potential as a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical.








Abstract
Rigid pyclen derivative ligands bearing hypoxia&#8208;sensitive nitroimidazole (NI) pendants, PC2A&#8208;Ph&#8208;NI (hexadentate) and PC2AM&#8208;NI (heptadentate), were synthesized, radiolabeled with 44Sc(III), and evaluated under preclinical circumstances. Physicochemical characterization was carried out using the structurally related model ligand, PC2AMnBu, by multinuclear NMR, UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, and pH&#8208;potentiometry. Sc(III) ion was found to form a stable complex with PC2AMnBu (log KScL&#160;=&#160;19.53(4); pSc&#160;=&#160;19.32), in a reasonably fast reaction, with outstanding inertness (t1/2 = 529&#160;hours in 1&#160;M HClO4). The [Sc(PC2AMnBu)]+ complex can coordinate fluoride (log KScLF&#160;=&#160;2.5(2)), and the ternary complex is remarkably inert against fluoride exchange. Based on these results, the PC2A&#8208;mono(amide) platform seems to be a promising Sc(III)&#8208;binder, paving the way for the labeling of NI&#8208;containing ligands with 44Sc(III). Followed by successful radiolabeling with the positron&#8208;emitting 44Sc isotope, labeling yields of 92% and over 99% were evidenced for [44Sc][Sc(PC2AM&#8208;NI)]+ and [44Sc][Sc(PC2A&#8208;Ph&#8208;NI)]+; respectively, at 95 &#176;C and 15&#160;minutes; moreover, after purification, the radiochemical purity exceeded 99%. Both radiocomplexes remained stable in rat blood serum for at least 4 hours and exhibited high resistance toward transmetalation and transchelation processes. MicroPET imaging with preclinical models of B16&#8208;F10 mouse melanoma was conducted to assess the tumor targeting capability and the in vivo biodistribution pattern of [44Sc][Sc(PC2AM&#8208;NI)] and [44Sc][Sc(PC2A&#8208;Ph&#8208;NI)]+ radiopharmaceuticals. Given the higher tumor uptakes of [44Sc][Sc(PC2A&#8208;Ph&#8208;NI)]+ with decreasing off&#8208;target activity and related better tumor/noise ratios, we may conclude that the diagnostic potential of the PC2A&#8208;Ph&#8208;NI derivative outperforms that of the [44Sc][Sc(PC2AM&#8208;NI)]+.

&lt;p&gt;Hypoxia-sensitive nitroimidazole-functionalized pyclen derivatives were successfully synthesized and radiolabeled with &lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Sc(III), affording stable and inert scandium complexes. Remarkable Sc(III)-binding capabilities of the PC2A-mono(amide) platform enabled excellent radiolabeling performance, with &#8805;92&#8211;99% yields and &#8805;99% radiochemical purity. MicroPET studies confirmed efficient tumor accumulation, with the PC2A-Ph-NI derivative exhibiting superior biodistribution and tumor-to-background ratios, highlighting its potential as a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rigid pyclen derivative ligands bearing hypoxia-sensitive nitroimidazole (NI) pendants, PC2A-Ph-NI (hexadentate) and PC2AM-NI (heptadentate), were synthesized, radiolabeled with &lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Sc(III), and evaluated under preclinical circumstances. Physicochemical characterization was carried out using the structurally related model ligand, PC2AM&lt;sup&gt;nBu&lt;/sup&gt;, by multinuclear NMR, UV-Vis spectroscopy, and pH-potentiometry. Sc(III) ion was found to form a stable complex with PC2AM&lt;sup&gt;nBu&lt;/sup&gt; (log &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ScL&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;=&#160;19.53(4); pSc&#160;=&#160;19.32), in a reasonably fast reaction, with outstanding inertness (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; = 529&#160;hours in 1&#160;M HClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). The [Sc(PC2AM&lt;sup&gt;nBu&lt;/sup&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; complex can coordinate fluoride (log &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Selective Recognition of Physiological Phosphates by Luminescent Europium(III) Probes via Analyte&#8208;Specific Energy&#8208;Transfer Pathways</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synopsis: Time&#8208;resolved luminescent Eu(III) probes, [Eu.L1] and [Eu.L2], can discriminate Pi and NPPs in H2O based on their differential binding interaction triggered by analyte&#8208;specific energy&#8208;transfer pathways.








Abstract
The physiological phosphates (PPs) are crucial in various biochemical pathways and bioenergetics. Their dysregulation is associated with multiple cellular dysfunctions and life&#8208;threatening diseases. Designing sensitive and selective bioresponsive probes capable of differentiating Pi/NPPs levels is crucial for diagnostics and therapy. Developing probes for selective discrimination of phosphates faces intrinsic challenges due to their high hydration energy (&#916;Ghyd) barrier and structural similarity. The hard Ln(III) ions can overcome the high &#916;Ghyd barrier and are ideal for the detection and discrimination of PPs due to their longer lifetimes, using time&#8208;resolved luminescence (TRL) assays. Herein, two water&#8208;soluble luminescent Eu(III) probes, [Eu.L1] and [Eu.L2], can discriminate physiological inorganic (Pi) and nucleoside polyphosphates (NPPs) in H2O based on their differential binding interaction with the respective probe, triggering analyte&#8208;specific energy&#8208;transfer pathways. We established the involvement of coordinative unsaturation and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interaction between the [Eu.L] probes and PPs, which modulates the nonradiative vibrational energy transfer (VET) and photo&#8208;induced electron transfer (PeT) pathways, responsible for their specific luminescence response and selectivity. The interaction of phosphates with the Eu(III) probes were monitored by TRL spectroscopy, lifetime (&#964;) and hydration state (q) measurements, and 31P NMR spectroscopy. These results connect the intricate molecular interactions of the [Eu.L] probes with PPs with concomitant TRL&#8208;responses.

         <title>One&#8208;pot Modular Synthesis of Hydroquinolines, Hydrofluorenones, and Aryl Fluorenones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fundamentally unique method for building the fluorenone skeleton via a one&#8208;pot, stereo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective multi&#8208;bond&#8208;forming reaction of abundant starting materials is reported. Up to 8 new (C&#8208;C, and C&#8208;N) bonds, 3 cycles, and up to 4 stereocenters were built in a single operation with exclusive stereo and regioselectivity. The resulting aryl fluorenone was transformed to spirobifluorenes, which exhibit high potential as host materials for PhOLEDs.








Abstract
Many natural products and bioactive molecules are built on hydroquinolines, hydrofluorenones, and fluorenones. In addition, aryl fluorenones and their derivatives, such as spirobifluorene, are widely used as a key molecular framework for the development of organic electronic materials. The synthesis of aryl fluorenones relies on multiple steps involving at least two transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp2) coupling reactions to build the fluorenone ring, which impede the easy accessibility of these materials for academic research and follow&#8208;up practical applications. Herein, we report a fundamentally unique method to build the fluorenone skeleton via a one&#8208;pot reaction under metal&#8208;free conditions. The method relies on the formation of hydroquinolines and hydrofluorenones via a diastereo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective multi&#8208;bond forming reaction of feedstock chemicals. Up to 8 new (C&#8208;C, C&#8208;N, and C&#8208;O) bonds, 3 cycles, and up to 4 stereocenters were built in a single operation with exclusive diastereo and regioselectivity. DFT studies provided insights into the diastereo&#8208; and regioselectivity of this reaction. The aryl groups of aryl fluorenones, which are generally installed via transition metal&#8208;catalyzed coupling reaction of pre&#8208;functionalized arene moiety, are incorporated from readily available aryl aldehyde under metal&#8208;free conditions. The spirobifluorenes derived from these arylated fluorenones showed to have appropriate triplet energy, HOMO/LUMO levels, and thermal stability which indicate their potential as a host material for PhOLED.

         <title>A Redox&#8208;Tunable Carborane Crown: Toward Highly Selective Electrochemical Lithium Capture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical reduction transforms a new carborane&#8211;crown into a potent 2e&#8722; reduced nido anion with a redox&#8208;tunable cavity that captures Li&#8314; selectively over Na&#8314; and K&#8314;. The coupling of electronic control and size&#8208;matched binding offers a blueprint for selective, rapid lithium recovery for next&#8208;generation direct lithium extraction.








Abstract
Lithium is a critical element with a projected exponential rise in demand due to its widespread use in battery energy storage. New methods to extract Li+, such as through membrane adsorption&#8208;based direct Li+ extraction (DLE) technologies, are at various stages of development and aim to separate Li+ from brine and even seawater. In this report, we present a fundamentally new class of highly selective Li+&#8208;capture agent, the carborane&#8208;crown compound, 1,2&#8208;((6,6,7,7&#8208;Me4)14&#8208;crown&#8208;4)&#8208;ortho&#8208;carborane (14C4Cb), which is electrochemically activated for strong, selective Li+ binding over Na+ and K+. This newly synthesized extractant features a redox&#8208;tunable cavity size, giving rise to tunable binding constants for Li+ capture, favorable coulombic interactions between the reduced anionic capture agent and the Li+ cations, and boasts the benefit of rapid, electrochemically driven capture kinetics. Weak, negligible binding to Li+ was observed in the neutral &#8220;closo&#8221; carborane state (14C4Cb), whereas strong binding was observed in the cage&#8208;opened reduced nido state (14C4Cb2&#8722;). Equilibrium (K) binding constants were measured through experimental and simulated voltammetry, yielding the following log Kmetal (experimental; simulation) values: log KLi (6.8&#160;&#177;&#160;0.6; 8.0), log KNa (3.7&#160;&#177;&#160;0.2; 4.9), log KK (1.7&#160;&#177;&#160;0.2; 2.2). Rapid mass transport of Li+ to the electrode surface resulted in the simulated value (log KLi&#160;=&#160;8.0) representing a lower&#8208;limit value for log KLi as described herein. The observed strong binding to Li+ over Na+ and K+ is attributed to both the favorable redox&#8208;tunable crown cavity size of the 14C4Cb/14C4Cb2&#8722; couple, combined with strong coulombic interactions in the reduced nido state. This platform offers a potential new, rapid, and highly selective technique for Li+ capture in next&#8208;generation electrochemical DLE technologies.

&lt;sub&gt;Li&lt;/sub&gt; (6.8&#160;&#177;&#160;0.6; &lt;i&gt;8.0&lt;/i&gt;), log &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt; (3.7&#160;&#177;&#160;0.2; &lt;i&gt;4.9&lt;/i&gt;), log &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt; (1.7&#160;&#177;&#160;0.2; &lt;i&gt;2.2&lt;/i&gt;). Rapid mass transport of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to the electrode surface resulted in the simulated value (log &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;Li&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;=&#160;8.0) representing a lower-limit value for log &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;Li&lt;/sub&gt; as described herein. The observed strong binding to Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; over Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is attributed to both the favorable redox-tunable crown cavity size of the &lt;b&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;14C4&lt;/sup&gt;Cb/&lt;sup&gt;14C4&lt;/sup&gt;Cb&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; couple, combined with strong coulombic interactions in the reduced &lt;i&gt;nido&lt;/i&gt; state. This platform offers a potential new, rapid, and highly selective technique for Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; capture in next-generation electrochemical DLE technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Monosaccharide&#8208;Derived Enantioselectivity in SWCNT Chemoresistive VOC Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective sensing of minimally functionalized chiral VOCs with common recognition layers remains challenging. A chemoresistive sensor based on semiconducting single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes modified with multichiral and multifunctional substituted monosaccharides displays intriguing chiral preference toward (&#8211;)&#8208;limonene and (&#8211;)&#8208;carvone enantiomers. A novel class of tunable substituted monosaccharide&#8208;based eNoses is envisioned.








Abstract
Semiconducting single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (sc&#8208;SWCNTs) are of great potential for vapor sensing. However, sc&#8208;SWCNTs lack recognition features for discriminating between sparsely functionalized moieties, molecules with similar structural features, and enantiomer pairs. This becomes a major setback in discriminating between volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Here, we used two galactosides decorated with aromatic groups as a recognition layer in chemoresistive sc&#8208;SWCNT sensors to produce chiral preference toward six terpenoid enantiomers. The multichirality and multifunctionality of a monosaccharide scaffold were exploited to maximize the limited interacting features associated with VOCs. The developed system establishes a robust and tunable platform for enantioselective gas sensing.

         <title>In Situ Observation of Polyoxometalate Formation by Vibrational Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In&#8208;situ IR and Raman spectroscopy were employed to observe the formation of polyoxometalates (POMs) in aqueous solution. Thereby key intermediates were identified, and better understanding of POM formation enabled the development of an improved method for the synthesis of vanadium&#8208;substituted phosphomolybdates, which are important catalysts for sustainable applications. The findings streamline POM synthesis procedures by reducing energy input and shortening reaction times.








Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are multinuclear clusters of transition metals and oxo&#8208;ligands. They have a long history and are still gaining an increased relevance for diverse applications, such as sustainable catalysis. Although the first examples were discovered over a century ago, little is known about the process of their formation. We have now employed modern in situ IR and Raman techniques to gain insights into the processes of the formation of different POM structures in aqueous solution. Thereby, we were able to identify intermediates and optimize reaction conditions. We found that POM formation proceeds very rapidly even at low temperatures, making it unnecessary to reflux the synthesis solutions for multiple hours. With this knowledge, we developed an improved synthetic method for vanadium&#8208;substituted phosphomolybdates, which are of high relevance for sustainable catalysis.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Based Amphiphilic Farnesyl Glycidyl Ether Block Copolymers: Aqueous Self&#8208;Assembly and Solubilization Boosting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bio&#8208;derived amphiphilic poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(terpenyl glycidyl ether) diblock copolymers (mPEG114&#8208;b&#8208;PTGEm) were synthesized via AROP from farnesyl glycidyl ether (FarGE) and its hexahydrogenated derivative (HHFarGE). Block copolymer amphiphilicity is easily tunable via the TGE block size m and systematically affects the critical micelle concentration. Adding even small amounts of mPEG114&#8208;b&#8208;PTGEm to microemulsions leads to a significant increase of the solubilization efficiency.








Abstract
Sustainability has become essential in addressing the substitution of depleting fossil&#8208;based resources with bio&#8208;renewable alternatives, including products active at interfaces, such as surfactants. Enhancing their efficiency reduces both ecological and economic impact. Here, we present amphiphilic poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(terpenyl glycidyl ether) diblock copolymers synthesized via anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization from two terpenyl glycidyl ethers (TGE) based on the naturally occurring terpenoid farnesol, farnesyl glycidyl ether (FarGE), and its hydrogenated derivative hexahydrofarnesyl glycidyl ether (HHFarGE). Using poly(ethylene glycol) monomethyl ether (mPEG114) as a macroinitiator resulted in controlled molecular weights (5600 &#8211; 8400 g&#183;mol&#8722;1) with low dispersities&#160;&#272; (1.04&#8211;1.07). Fluorescence spectroscopy and light scattering revealed low critical micelle concentrations with a systematic decrease with increasing TGE block size due to the hydrophobic effect. The addition of small amounts of mPEG114&#8208;b&#8208;PTGEm to microemulsions leads to a significant increase of the solubilization efficiency not limited to conventional H2O/NaCl &#8211; n&#8208;decane &#8211; tetraethylene glycol monodecyl ether microemulsions, but also in sustainable H2O &#8211; isopropyl myristate &#8211; n&#8208;octyl &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;glucopyranoside &#8211; farnesol formulations, serving as model systems for cosmetic applications. Using SANS, we observed that adsorption of the copolymer at the amphiphilic film leads to an increased structural order of bicontinuous microemulsions due to a higher film bending rigidity.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of [MF5(terpy)]+ (M&#160;=&#160;Mo, W) Salts: Autoionization of MF6 Induced by a Tridentate Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hexafluorides MoF6 and WF6 autoionize in the presence of the tridentate terpyridine ligand, yielding [MF5(terpy)]+[MF7]&#8211; (M&#160;=&#160;Mo, W). The octacoordinated [MF5(terpy)]+ cations adopt bicapped trigonal prismatic geometries. The [WF7]&#8211; can be substituted for [SbF6]&#8211; using SbF5SO2, whereas the reaction was unsuccessful for displacing the [MoF7]&#8211; anion. The M&#9472;N bond has substantial covalent character, with the Wiberg bond indices (WBIs) being more than half of those of the M&#9472;F bonds.








Abstract
The reactions of the hexafluorides MoF6 and WF6 with the tridentate ligand terpyridine (terpy) result in autoionization forming [MF5(terpy)][MF7] (M&#160;=&#160;Mo, W) salts. Displacement of [WF7]&#8211; utilizing SbF5, yielded [WF5(terpy)][SbF6]. The octacoordinate [MF5(terpy)]+ cations adopt a bicapped trigonal prismatic geometry based on X&#8208;ray crystallography and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which is different than the geometry of previously reported fluorido WVI cations. The [MoF5(terpy)]+ cation represents the first fluorido MoVI cation.

         <title>High&#8208;Affinity Peptide&#8208;Drug Conjugate Ligands for the TRIM24 PHD and Bromodomain</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a series of bivalent peptide&#8208;drug conjugate (PDC) ligands for tripartite motif&#8208;containing protein 24 (TRIM24). These ligands simultaneously engage the PHD and BRD of TRIM24 through an intramolecular (in cis) binding mode, resulting in high affinity binding. By incorporating a trimethyllysine (KMe3) mimic and a BRD ligand, these PDCs can disrupt the multivalent chromatin interactions of TRIM24, resulting in complete inhibition of its epigenetic reader function.








Abstract
TRIM24 is an epigenetic transcriptional coregulator that &#8220;reads&#8221; KMe3 and KAc histone modifications via its tandem plant homeodomain (PHD) and bromodomain (BRD), respectively. The PHD and BRD are potential therapeutic targets due to the roles of TRIM24 in breast cancer progression. However, there are currently no small&#8208;molecule ligands for the PHD, and existing TRIM24 BRD inhibitors lack selectivity over the main off&#8208;target, BRPF1. Here, we report the development of the first bivalent tool molecules capable of simultaneously engaging both the TRIM24 PHD and BRD. Key to this strategy was the identification of effective KMe3 bioisosteres that enhance H3 peptide binding to the TRIM24 PHD. The most promising of these was incorporated into a nine amino acid H3&#8208;mimicking peptide, and linked to a TRIM24 BRD ligand. The resulting peptide&#8208;drug conjugates (PDCs) bind to TRIM24 with picomolar affinity and a slow dissociation rate (koff), which is driven by an in cis bivalent binding mode. Although the PDCs showed limited effects on breast cancer cell proliferation in vitro, this work underscores their potential as tools for studying previously unliganded reader domains and consequently advancing our understanding of multivalent epigenetic regulation in disease.

         <title>Systematic Determination of Structure&#8208;Activity&#8208;Selectivity Correlations for the Catalytic Oxidation of Glucose to Acetic Acid Depending on the Structure Type of the Used Polyoxometalate Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we investigate in detail the influence of different polyoxometalate structure types on the reaction pathways and kinetics for the selective catalytic oxidation of glucose to acetic acid.








Abstract
The BioValCat (Enhanced Biomass Valorization by Engineering of Polyoxometalate Catalysts) project aims for developing homogeneously catalyzed, selective biomass transformation techniques toward an industrially viable biomass valorization process. The present study sets out the foundations for a scalable, safe, and economic procedure for the oxidation of biomass to valuable products. The extension of the product scope to higher carboxylic acids is of great interest. Herein, we investigate in detail the influence of different polyoxometalate (POM) structure types on the reaction pathways and kinetics for the selective catalytic oxidation of glucose to acetic acid (AA). The results have shown severe structure&#8208;selectivity relationships depending on the used POM structure type. Whereas Lindqvist and Anderson&#8208;Evans structures promote the [C3&#160;+&#160;C3] pathway leading to high AA yields above 20%, Keggin and Wells&#8208;Dawson structures are more inclined to follow the [C1&#160;+&#160;C5] pathway, resulting mainly in levulinic acid formation. With respect to kinetics, the Anderson&#8208;type Na9TeV3W3O24 catalyst showed the highest reaction rate amongst all POMs with 32.62&#160;mmol L&#8722;1 min&#8722;1, followed by the Lindqvist&#8208;type Na5V3W3O19 with 27.26&#160;mmol L&#8722;1 min&#8722;1, the Keggin&#8208;type Na6PV3W9O40 with 21.50&#160;mmol L&#8722;1 min&#8722;1 and the Wells&#8208;Dawson&#8208;type Na9P2V3W15O62 with a reaction rate of only 14.50&#160;mmol L&#8722;1 min&#8722;1. Overall, the results demonstrate that the reaction pathways and efficiencies in the catalytic oxidation of glucose vary significantly among POMs with different structure types. These findings provide a basis for optimizing the application of POMs in biomass valorization reactions and suggest potential directions for developing more efficient catalysts in the near future.

         <title>Nb&#8208;Promoted Pt/MoOx/TiO2 Catalysts for Low&#8208;Temperature CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nb&#8208;promoted Pt/MoOx/TiO2 catalysts displayed enhanced methanol formation from CO2 hydrogenation at low temperature (STYMeOH&#160;=&#160;3.8&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at 150&#160;&#176;C). Mechanistic study revealed that all components are essential for methanol production.








Abstract
The catalytic hydrogenation of carbon dioxide (CO2) to methanol under mild conditions presents a sustainable route for carbon recycling and chemical energy storage. However, the inert nature of CO2 and high activation energy barrier for methanol formation remain major challenges. In this study, we developed a series of Nb&#8208;promoted Pt/MoOx/TiO2 catalysts for efficient CO2 hydrogenation at temperatures below 200&#160;&#176;C. Among these, Pt(5)/Mo(10)&#8208;Nb(1)/TiO2 exhibited superior performance, achieving a high methanol productivity of 3.8&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at 150&#160;&#176;C, outperforming the commercial Cu&#8208;ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst under comparable conditions. The catalyst showed stable performance during a 400&#160;h long&#8208;term reaction. Detailed in situ and operando spectroscopic studies revealed that Pt sites were primarily responsible for H2 activation, while partially reduced MoOx species facilitated the formation of oxygenated intermediates. The incorporation of highly dispersed Nb species promoted methanol desorption and inhibited its decomposition, thereby contributing to the overall catalytic efficiency. This study outlines a rational design approach for constructing robust low&#8208;temperature catalysts and provides mechanistic insights into the synergistic roles of the metal and oxide components in CO2&#8208;to&#8208;methanol conversion.

         <title>Size&#8208;Controlled Cobalt Nanoplates and Their Impact on Oxygen Evolution Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt nanoplate nanoparticles with controlled diameter size are presented to enhance catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction. This improvement is attributed to a high proportion of {101&#175;$\bar 1$1} surface facets and the presence of defects such as step&#8208;edges and stacking faults.








Abstract
Controlling the size of nanoparticles is important in catalytic reactions, not only for tuning the surface area but also for modifying the electronic structure. However, achieving precise size control in 2D structures remains challenging. In this work, we demonstrate precise size control of cobalt nanoplates, ranging from 19&#160;nm to 80&#160;nm, which is achieved by tuning the ratio of two surfactants used in the synthesis. The 19&#160;nm of Co nanoplates exhibit higher oxygen evolution reaction activity due to a higher proportion of {101&#175;$\bar 1$1} to {0001} facets. This size control allows systematic investigation into how nanoplate dimensions influence catalytic performance in the oxygen evolution reaction, offering new insights into structure&#8208;activity relationships of cobalt nanocatalysts.

Abstract
The sulfenylative N&#8208;glycosylation of glycals, which exhibits high &#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity, has been successfully developed for the first time under the facilitating effect of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP). This method is broadly applicable to four classes of nitrogen nucleophiles, including sulfamides, carbamates, ureas, and azoles. Furthermore, various glycal derivatives, such as D&#8208;galactal, D&#8208;arabinal, L&#8208;fucal, and D&#8208;glucal, can be effectively employed in this reaction system. A range of 2&#8208;phenylthio&#8208;N&#8208;glycosides were obtained in moderate to good yields with consistently high &#946;&#8208;selectivity (&#946;:&#945; &gt; 20:1). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the origin of the observed stereoselectivity and highlight the critical role of HFIP in promoting the glycosylation process.

         <title>Unravelling the Mechano&#8208;Responsive Solvent Inclusion Behaviour of a Luminescent Organic Solid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two crystalline solids, viz. C&#8208;Y and C&#8208;G forms, were obtained from an organic luminogen, 2N&#8208;4OH. The C&#8208;G form, isolated as DMF solvate, respond differently to mechanical grinding and compression producing metastable C&#8208;G(M) and C&#8208;M phases respectively, each of which were isolated and characterised.








Abstract
Organic solids typically adopt close&#8208;packed structures to maximize the weak intermolecular interactions. From this perspective, unraveling the conditions in which a seemingly close&#8208;packed molecular solid undergoes guest&#8208;induced phase transition and shows reversible guest inclusion/desolvation behavior remains a challenge. An organic luminogen, 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;benzoic acid (2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;naphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;ylmethylene)&#8208;hydrazide (2N&#8208;4 OH), produced two types of solids, viz., the yellow emissive C&#8208;Y form and the green emissive C&#8208;G form, of which the latter form was isolated as N.N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) solvate. The green emissive C&#8208;G phase exhibited distinctive responses under conditions of mechanical grinding and compression, which was evident from spectroscopic, thermal, and X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements. Further, when infused with DMF vapor, the C&#8208;Y form transformed into the green emissive metastable C&#8208;M form, which was structurally similar to the metastable phase obtained from the C&#8208;G form upon hydraulic compression. Subsequently, we explain the relation between the C&#8208;Y and C&#8208;G forms, obtained directly upon crystallization, and the metastable C&#8208;M form and the C&#8208;G(M) form obtained after mechanical stimulation.

         <title>Phase Stabilities and Influence on Magnetic and Electrical Properties of the System (MgxMn4&#8208;x)MnVO8</title>

Substitution of divalent manganese by magnesium in Mn5VO8 was found to introduce a change of structure and electrical conductivities.








Abstract
Manganese vanandates have a wide range of interesting material properties, covering magnetic, electrical, and catalytic aspects. Among them, Mn5VO8 is a compound containing manganese in both its trivalent as well as divalent oxidation states with ordering of the different manganese species on different crystallographic sites. In this article, we show that the divalent manganese can be replaced by magnesium fully up to a composition of Mg4MnVO8. For low magnesium content, this results in a change of symmetry from triclinic to monoclinic, whereas for Mg4MnVO8, a trigonal modification can be found in addition to a monoclinic phase. Density Functional Theory based calculations reveal that for magnesium rich compositions, monoclinic and trigonal modifications are energetically similar. Magnetic characterization reveals that the materials are paramagnetic around room temperature. Further, the magnesium substitution results in a strong decrease of electrical conductivity with an increase of the activation energy determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Generation of Air&#8208;stable Zn(I) Under Ambient Conditions</title>

Light irradiation pumps electrons from carboxylate to bipyridine via the Zn center, generating persistent air&#8208;stable Zn+ species within a 1D polymeric ladder. 








Abstract
Research on the synthesis and stabilization of air&#8208;stable monovalent zinc (Zn+) species under mild conditions remains relatively unexplored. This article reports the synthesis of a new zinc coordination polymer, [Zn2(PA)4(bipy)2]n&#183;nH2O (1) (PA&#160;=&#160;propionate; bipy&#160;=&#160;bipyridine), which generates stable Zn+ species upon photoirradiation under ambient conditions. Compound 1 features a metalloviologen structure built by 1&#8208;D ladder&#8208;like chains. Upon Xe lamp irradiation, it changes from colorless to light brown, which is accompanied by the emergence of new electron absorption bands assigned to bipy radical anions and Zn+ species by UV&#8211;vis and EPR tests. PXRD, Raman, and IR analyses indicate that the crystalline framework remains but distortion happens during photoirradiation. The photoinduced Zn+ species remains stable under ambient conditions for at least 7 days. This work demonstrates that air&#8208;stable Zn+ species can be easily prepared through the coordination assembly of Zn2+ ion, carboxylate and bipyridine and further light stimulation, which will help to understand the chemical bonding nature or find catalytic and other applications of Zn+&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Targeting G&#8208;Rich lncRNA and its Structural Polymorphism with Selective G&#8208;Quadruplex Ligands: An NMR Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The REG1CP&#8208;derived RNA oligonucleotide SL15P adopts a parallel G&#8208;quadruplex (rGQ) structure. In this study, we investigate the effect of several well&#8208;characterized ligands, originally developed for DNA GQs, on the RNA counterpart, with the aim of evaluating their binding ability and specific binding modes.








Abstract
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play essential regulatory roles, often mediated by complex structural elements such as RNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (rGQs). While ligand interactions with DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (dGQs) have been extensively studied, for rGQs remain less explored. Here, we studied the SL15P RNA oligonucleotide derived from the REG1CP lncRNA, which adopts a parallel rGQ structure in equilibrium with a hairpin (Hp). A set of 12 small molecules, previously known for their ability to make complex with dGQs, was tested for their ability to bind and stabilize the SL15P rGQ. Using NMR spectroscopy, we analyzed complex formation and assessed whether these ligands could promote rGQ folding under conditions where the Hp structure is favored. Melting experiments with circular dichroism (CD) quantified the thermal stabilization induced by ligand binding. Our results show that ligands known to target dGQs exhibit different behaviors toward rGQs. Among the tested compounds, 360A, PhenDC3, and PDS proved to be the most effective, as they induced well&#8208;defined complex formation and significant stabilization of the SL15P rGQ. PhenDC3 showed evidence of a dual binding interaction. This study emphasizes that the binding of ligands to rGQs can be highly variable and supports the rational design of selective compounds for therapeutic purposes.

         <title>A 2D Chemically Stable Cu&#8208;MOF for Green Synthesis of Bioactive 4H&#8208;Pyran Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient, green Cu&#8208;MOF catalyst,&#160;IITKGP&#8208;54&#160;was strategically designed and developed for the catalytic synthesis of pharmacologically important 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;cyano&#8208;4H&#8208;pyran derivatives, thereby expanding the applicability of 2D MOF&#8208;based heterogenous catalysts in one&#8208;pot, sustainable 4H&#8208;pyran synthesis.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are widely used as heterogeneous catalysts, offering high densities of tunable active sites for multicomponent organic transformations. However, the development of catalytically efficient and chemically robust 2D MOFs remains a significant challenge, especially under harsh reaction conditions. Herein, we report the green synthesis of a 2D robust mixed&#8208;ligand based Cu(II)&#8208;MOF, IITKGP&#8208;54, demonstrating exceptional chemical stability in water and across a wide range of aqueous pH&#8208;solutions (pH = 2&#8211;10). Owing to the accessible Lewis acidic open metal sites (OMSs), IITKGP&#8208;54 exhibits superior catalytic activities toward rarely explored three&#8208;component condensation reaction to produce pharmacologically important 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;cyano&#8208;4H&#8208;pyran derivatives, offering several advantages including low catalyst loading, operation in green solvent, broad substrate compatibility and excellent recyclability without structural degradation, which highlights its superiority as environmentally benign heterogeneous catalyst for this transformation over other homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts used earlier. IITKGP&#8208;54 expands the utility of 2D MOF catalysts for one&#8208;pot sustainable synthesis of bioactive 4H&#8208;pyran derivatives.

         <title>Tracking Dual&#8208;Pathway Self&#8208;Assembly via Butterfly&#8208;Motion&#8208;Based Molecular Fragment Conformational Transformation in Aqueous Homopolypeptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homopolypeptides with terminal VIE fluorophores undergo solvent&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly into distinct nanostructures. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) induces chiral nanotoroids with strong CPL, while 1,4 &#8208; Dioxane (DOA) forms nonchiral nanorods without CPL. The assembly pathways are monitored in real&#8208;time via ratiometric fluorescence, enabling precise control over chiroptical properties in aqueous media.








Abstract
Despite the inherent chirality of peptides, the development of peptide&#8208;based luminescent nanomaterials has been impeded by weak fluorescence and unclear self&#8208;assembly mechanisms. Herein, we report a straightforward strategy to direct supramolecular assembly by end&#8208;functionalizing homopolypeptides with a vibration&#8208;induced emission (VIE) motif. This system exhibits dual&#8208;pathway self&#8208;assembly, enabling real&#8208;time monitoring of the assembly process via ratiometric fluorescence changes. Depending on the solvent used, the homopolypeptides self&#8208;organize into either nanotoroids or nanorods, which display distinct CPL properties: the nanotoroids exhibit strong CPL activity, whereas the nanorods are CPL&#8208;silent. This work not only establishes a versatile platform for constructing efficient aqueous CPL&#8208;active nanomaterials but also elucidates the correlation between supramolecular morphology and chiroptical output, paving the way for the rational design of biocompatible chiral luminescent systems.

         <title>Hybrid Detergents Facilitate Scalable Charge Reduction and Stabilize Membrane Proteins While Retaining Lipid Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid detergents enable the purification and native mass spectrometry analysis of membrane proteins and associated lipids. Chemical tuning of headgroups in hybrid detergents enables control over charge reduction, oligomer stability, and lipid retention, which enables the analysis of intact membrane proteins and their interactions with associated lipids.








Abstract
Membrane protein complexes regulate many biological functions, yet they are incredibly challenging to handle. Detergents are a key enabling technology for purification and analysis as they can provide membrane proteins with controlled solubility, stability, and heterogeneity. However, the design criteria for detergents that enable both the purification and analysis of membrane proteins with their associated lipids remain unclear. Here, we leverage the modular nature of nonionic hybrid detergents to chemically tune molecular parameters that are important for maintaining native oligomeric states of membrane protein complexes and copurifying lipids. Tuning the hydrophilic&#8208;lipophilic balance (HLB), and the relative size of a nonionic head in proximity to a tetraethylene glycol headgroup, led to altered charge reduction, retention of protein oligomers and changed the relative degree of copurifying lipids from purification to analysis in a predictable manner. Our findings represent a significant step forward in the investigation of membrane proteins and interactions with lipids.

         <title>Thienylene&#8208;Based Diradicaloids: Electrochromic Ring&#8208;Closing of Dithienylethene&#8208;Based Bis&#8208;Amidinium Cation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable crystalline thienylene&#8208;based diradicaloids are reported along with photochromic dithienylethene&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;conjugated spacer. En&#8208;route to this an electrochromic (reductive as well as electron&#8208;mediated) ring&#8208;closing of the dithienylethene&#8208;core is established, an alternative stimulus in place of UV light.








Abstract
Due to the lower aromaticity of thiophene compared to benzene, thiophene&#8208;based diradicaloid compounds prefer larger weightage of their quinoid form (closed&#8208;shell electronic configuration) than their benzoid form (open&#8208;shell electronic configuration). At the same time, the lower aromaticity of thiophene facilitates its participation in electrocyclic reactions and as a result dithienylethene&#8208;derivatives represent a classical example of photochromism. Here a modular approach for the synthesis of crystalline thienylene&#8208;, bithienylene&#8208;, and terthienylene&#8208;based diradicaloids is reported with acyclic diaminocarbene&#8208;scaffold as end&#8208;caps. The influence of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated spacer is reflected in their triplet population at room temperature: thienylene&#8208; and bithienylene&#8208;bridged diradicaloids are EPR inactive whereas the terthienylene&#8208;bridged one exhibits an EPR signal, the intensity of which increases with rising temperature. A dithienylethene&#8208;based photochromic bis&#8208;amidinium cation was also designed and synthesized to obtain a related thienylene&#8208;based diradicaloid. Under two&#8208;electron reduction the crystalline diradicaloid is formed with a concurrent reductive ring&#8208;closing of the dithienylethene&#8208;core. Moreover, a two&#8208;electron oxidation of this dithienylethene&#8208;based diradicaloid leads to the closed&#8208;form of the dithienylethene&#8208;based photochromic bis&#8208;amidinium cation. Overall, this demonstrates the structurally characterized electrochromic (reductive as well as electron&#8208;mediated) ring&#8208;closing of a dithienylethene&#8208;based photochromic &#960;&#8208;non&#8208;conjugated bis&#8208;amidinium cation to the diradicaloid and &#960;&#8208;conjugated bis&#8208;amidinium cation, establishing an alternative stimulus in place of UV light.

         <title>Addressing Sustainability Challenges in Peptide Synthesis with Flow Chemistry and Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic protocol for polypeptides 6&#8211;58 residue long, using recyclable greener solvent mixture (Anisole/DMSO) was developed and compared to traditional SPPS methods and to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synthesizers.








Abstract
The high cost and the large amount of toxic waste generated during peptide production overshadow the current technology, requiring the reduction of excess reagents and the replacement of the solvents used. Advances have been made to replace N,N&#8208;Dimethylformamide with moderate success. By exploring the solvent parameter space, we have selected several mixtures, tested their swelling ability, amino acid solubility, coupling efficiency, and Fmoc&#8208;cleaving capacity, and found the Anisole/DMSO (17:3) mixture to be ideal for coupling. By adjusting the flow parameters, racemization was reduced to&#160;&lt;&#160;2% in the case of His, and&#160;&lt;&#160;1% for Cys. Several mixtures were screened for optimal Fmoc&#8208;cleavage, selected to cover the solvent parameter space uniformly. To test the selected solvent mixtures for aspartimide formation, and Fmoc&#8208;cleavage efficiency, both Scorpion Toxin II (VKDGYI) and JR10&#8208;mer (WFTTLISTIM) challenging sequences were synthesized. Fmoc&#8208;cleavage parameter optimization was performed using a machine learning algorithm (Bayesian Optimization) to reduce aspartimide formation and maximize Fmoc&#8208;deprotection. With the final parameters obtained, the Aib&#8208;ACP (10&#8208;mer), the glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP&#8208;1, 30&#8208;mer) and bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI, 58&#8208;mer) polypeptides were synthesized with high efficiency and synthetic speed (12&#160;min/cycle). The method is ideal for high temperature synthetic approaches and outperforms current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synthesizers.

By exploring the solvent parameter space, we have selected several mixtures, tested their swelling ability, amino acid solubility, coupling efficiency, and Fmoc-cleaving capacity, and found the Anisole/DMSO (17:3) mixture to be ideal for coupling. By adjusting the flow parameters, racemization was reduced to&#160;&amp;lt;&#160;2% in the case of His, and&#160;&amp;lt;&#160;1% for Cys. Several mixtures were screened for optimal Fmoc-cleavage, selected to cover the solvent parameter space uniformly. To test the selected solvent mixtures for aspartimide formation, and Fmoc-cleavage efficiency, both Scorpion Toxin II (VKDGYI) and JR10-mer (WFTTLISTIM) challenging sequences were synthesized. Fmoc-cleavage parameter optimization was performed using a machine learning algorithm (Bayesian Optimization) to reduce aspartimide formation and maximize Fmoc-deprotection. With the final parameters obtained, the Aib-ACP (10-mer), the glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1, 30-mer) and bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI, 58-mer) polypeptides were synthesized with high efficiency and synthetic speed (12&#160;min/cycle). The method is ideal for high temperature synthetic approaches and outperforms current state-of-the-art synthesizers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Aza&#8208;indeno&#8208;aza&#8208;fluoranthene and Constitutional Isomers by Ring&#8208;Size Selective C&#8211;H Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of constitutional isomers of aza&#8208;indeno&#8208;aza&#8208;fluoranthene with different ring sizes has been synthesized. Their product distribution was controlled by adjusting parameters such as base, temperature, solvent, or additive in the Pd&#8208;catalyzed direct arylation step, thereby providing an overview about the options to control ring&#8208;size selectivity in C&#8211;H activation reactions.








Abstract
The fluoranthene motif combines a planar geometry with electron&#8208;deficient character, rendering fluoranthene and its larger congeners like indenofluoranthene suitable compounds for designing n&#8208;semiconducting materials for applications in organic electronics. However, examples in which their opto&#8208; and electrochemical properties are tuned through selective five&#8208; or six&#8208;membered ring annelation, as well as by isosteric nitrogen substitution of a C&#8211;H unit within the fluoranthene core, remain scarce. Here the structure&#8211;property&#8208;relationships of a series of aza&#8208;fluoranthene&#8208;derived constitutional isomers as well as their syntheses by selective Pd&#8208;catalyzed indeno&#8208; or benzannelation of the same precursor is described.

         <title>DNA Noncovalent Interactions of Dinuclear &#951;6&#8208;Arene Ru(II) Complexes: Influence of Complex Charge and Bridging Ligand Length on DNA Binding Mode and Cytotoxic Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of cationic dinuclear Ru(II)&#8208;&#951;&#8310;&#8208;arene analogues was developed to assess how overall charge and Ru&#8211;Ru distance influence DNA binding noncovalent interactions and cytotoxicity. NMR studies showed multiple binding modes with the B&#8208;form DNA oligonucleotide d(5&#900;&#8208;CGCGAATTCGCG&#8208;3&#900;)2, while the complexes displayed micromolar IC50 values against MCF&#8208;7, A2780, and A2780cis&#8208;resistant cell lines.








Abstract
A series of dinuclear &#951;&#8310;&#8208;arene Ru(II) complexes with the general formulae {[(&#951;&#8310;&#8208;p&#8208;cym)Ru(L1)]2(&#956;&#8208;BL&#8208;i)}2+ (1)&#8211;(3) and {[(&#951;&#8310;&#8208;p&#8208;cym)2Ru2(L1)(L2)](&#956;&#8208;BL&#8208;i)}3+ (4)&#8211;(6), [L1&#160;=&#160;benzo[h]quinoline (bq), L2&#160;=&#160;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (phe) and BL&#8208;i the bridging ligands with i&#160;=&#160;1 &#8208;3, 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (BL&#8208;1), 1,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethane (BL&#8208;2) and 1,3&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)propane (BL&#8208;3)] were synthesized and fully characterized by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. The crystal structures of the complexes (1)&#8211;(3) were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. DNA binding interactions of the water&#8208;soluble chloride salts of the complexes (4)&#8211;(6) were investigated by NMR spectroscopy using the B&#8208;type DNA model oligonucleotide duplex d(5&#8242;&#8208;CGCGAATTCGCG&#8208;3&#8242;)2. 1H NMR chemical shift changes revealed that the chelating ligands (phe or bq) partially intercalate and/or bind in the helix minor groove. Among these, complex {[(&#951;&#8310;&#8208;p&#8208;cym)2Ru2(phe)(bq)](&#956;&#8208;BL&#8208;1)}3+, (4), induced the most pronounced perturbations, including partial helix unwinding. Fluorescence quenching experiments yielded the Stern&#8211;Volmer constants (Ksv) and the binding constants (Kb) in the moderate&#8208;to&#8208;high affinity range, consistent with the NMR observations. Preliminary cytotoxicity studies showed that the chloride salts of the complexes (1)&#8211;(6) exhibit low&#8208;micromolar IC50 values against MCF&#8208;7, A2780, and cisplatin&#8208;resistant A2780cis&#8208;resistant cell lines, while showing moderate selectivity for cancer cells over normal fibroblasts.

         <title>Golgi&#8208;Targeted Viscosity Fluorescent Probe for Monitoring Acute Lung Injury</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we present a novel Golgi&#8208;targeted fluorescent probe, GV, designed for highly sensitive and selective monitoring of viscosity changes during Golgi stress in an acute lung injury (ALI) model. GV was successfully applied to visualize elevated Golgi viscosity in living cells under various stimuli. More importantly, we directly demonstrated a significant increase in Golgi viscosity in ALI mouse models. With its excellent photophysical properties and good biocompatibility, GV also shows great potential for exploring the pathological processes of other viscosity&#8208;related diseases.








Abstract
Acute lung injury (ALI) is a severe respiratory disorder driven by uncontrolled inflammation, where early diagnosis and intervention are critical. Recent evidence implicates Golgi apparatus dysfunction in ALI progression, but its biophysical changes remain unexplored. Here, we report GV, a novel Golgi&#8208;targeted fluorescent probe with high photostability, low cytotoxicity, and excellent specificity, enabling sensitive imaging of viscosity changes under stress. Using both cellular and mouse models of ALI, we demonstrated a significant increase in Golgi viscosity during disease progression. These findings suggest that Golgi viscosity may serve as a potential biomarker for ALI and establish GV as a powerful tool for investigating organelle&#8208;level biophysical alterations in inflammatory diseases.

         <title>Effect of Thionation of the Carbonyl Groups in Naphthalimide&#8208;Phenoxazine Electron Donor&#8211;Acceptor Dyads on the Excited&#8208; State Dynamics: Transient Optical and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Spectral Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thionation: Enhanced SOC and Unusually Large ZFS Parameters: Thionated electron donor&#8211;acceptor dyads based on naphthalimide (NI) and phenoxazine (PXZ) were prepared and the photophysical properties were studied. Fluorescence quenching and efficient intersystem crossing (ISC) were observed for the dyad with the NI unit thionated. Large zero field splitting D value of the triplet state indicates that the enhanced spin&#8208;orbit coupling effect by the thionated carbonyls in the chromophore.








Abstract
We performed thionation of the electron acceptor naphthalimide (NI) moiety in donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8208;A) dyads in a series of thio&#8208;substituted D&#8208;A dyads. Thionation significantly enhances the electron&#8208;accepting ability of the chromophore, facilitating the formation of low&#8208;lying charge&#8208;separated (CS) states. Femtosecond transient absorption spectra revealed intersystem crossing (ISC) rate constants of S&#8208;NI&#8208;PXZ (kISC&#160;=&#160;3.8&#160;&#215; 1011 s&#8722;1) and DS&#8208;NI&#8208;PXZ (kISC&#160;=&#160;2.4&#160;&#215; 1011 s&#8722;1), which are interestingly independent of the number of sulfur atoms. Generally, fluorescence quenching was observed due to the rapid ISC process. Native NI&#8208;PXZ exhibits thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Thionation increased the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap, making the TADF vanish. In n&#8208;hexane, nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy detected the triplet lifetimes shortened from 11.6 &#181;s of NI&#8208;PXZ to 0.66 &#181;s for S&#8208;NI&#8208;PXZ and 0.25 &#181;s for DS&#8208;NI&#8208;PXZ. Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance revealed the large zero&#8208;field splitting D value (4200&#8211;9800&#160;MHz) of the triplet state of the thionated derivatives, which is due to the much larger SOC matrix elements of triplet state of DS&#8208;NI&#8208;PXZ (ca. 135 cm&#8722;1) and DS&#8208;NI (ca. 136 cm&#8722;1) than the nonthionated NI (3.1 cm&#8722;1). Thionation of the carbonyl groups in chromophore is a promising method for design of triplet photosensitizers to achieve fast ISC.

Femtosecond transient absorption spectra revealed intersystem crossing (ISC) rate constants of &lt;b&gt;S-NI-PXZ&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ISC&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;=&#160;3.8&#160;&#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and &lt;b&gt;DS-NI-PXZ&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ISC&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;=&#160;2.4&#160;&#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), which are interestingly independent of the number of sulfur atoms. Generally, fluorescence quenching was observed due to the rapid ISC process. Native &lt;b&gt;NI-PXZ&lt;/b&gt; exhibits thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Thionation increased the singlet-triplet energy gap, making the TADF vanish. In &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-hexane, nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy detected the triplet lifetimes shortened from 11.6 &#181;s of &lt;b&gt;NI-PXZ&lt;/b&gt; to 0.66 &#181;s for &lt;b&gt;S-NI-PXZ&lt;/b&gt; and 0.25 &#181;s for &lt;b&gt;DS-NI-PXZ&lt;/b&gt;. Time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance revealed the large zero-field splitting &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt; value (4200&#8211;9800&#160;MHz) of the triplet state of the thionated derivatives, which is due to the much larger SOC matrix elements of triplet state of &lt;b&gt;DS-NI-PXZ&lt;/b&gt; (ca. 135 cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and &lt;b&gt;DS-NI&lt;/b&gt; (ca. 136 cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) than the nonthionated &lt;b&gt;NI&lt;/b&gt; (3.1 cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Thionation of the carbonyl groups in chromophore is a promising method for design of triplet photosensitizers to achieve fast ISC.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unexpected Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence/Long Persistent Luminescence Dual Changes Induced by Conformational Freezing in Difluoroboron &#946;&#8208;Diketonate Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents unexpected dual afterglow changes induced by conformational freezing in difluoroboron &#946;&#8208;diketonate systems: cyclized systems exhibit green RTP and weak OLPL, while noncyclized systems show blue TADF&#8208;type afterglow with stronger OLPL. This inversion, stemming from &#916;EST differences and variations in charge separation and exciton harvesting, shows great potential for dynamic anticounterfeiting and multilevel encryption.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and organic long persistent luminescence (OLPL) materials are the current research hotspots in the field of luminescence and have broad application prospects, but afterglow systems with stimulus response or dynamic changes are still rare. Herein, we report unexpected dual afterglow change induced by conformational freezing in difluoroboron &#946;&#8208;diketonate (BF2bdk) systems. The cyclized BF2bdk system (after conformational freezing) exhibits bright green RTP followed by weak OLPL, whereas noncyclized BF2bdk system (before conformational freezing) displays blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)&#8208;type afterglow with subsequent stronger OLPL. In&#8208;depth investigations reveal that the inversion in afterglow intensity and mechanism change arise from the difference in &#916;EST as well as the ability to undergo charge separation and harvest of excitons. Besides, this dual afterglow changing behavior with brightness inversion over time demonstrates significant potential for advanced dynamic anticounterfeiting and multilevel information encryption applications.

         <title>Porous Organic Frameworks Utilizing Halogen&#183;&#183;&#183;Halogen Interactions of X4&#8211;tetra[2,3]Thienylene (X&#160;=&#160;Br, I): Guest Dynamics and Dielectric Response</title>

         <dc:description>
X4&#8208;tetrahalo[2,3]thienylene with four halogen atoms (X&#160;=&#160;Br and I) at the molecular terminals were used to investigate the formation of various guest inclusion crystals through intermolecular halogen&#183;&#183;&#183;halogen (X&#183;&#183;&#183;X) interactions and the dynamics of guest molecules.








Abstract
X4&#8208;tetrabromo[2,3]thienylene (1, Br4&#8208;tetra[2,3]thienylene) and X4&#8208;tetraiodotetra[2,3]thienylene (2, I4&#8208;tetra[2,3]thienylene) were used to investigate the formation of various guest inclusion crystals through intermolecular halogen&#183;&#183;&#183;halogen (X&#183;&#183;&#183;X) interactions and the dynamics of guest molecules. 1 and 2 formed host&#8211;guest crystals with aromatic molecules such as benzene (Bz), toluene (Tol), anisole (An), and chlorobenzene (ClBz). X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis revealed the formation of a channel structure where 1D chains formed by intermolecular X&#183;&#183;&#183;X interactions were arranged in a grid pattern. Host lattices of 1 and 2 were capable of reversibly adsorbing and desorbing Tol molecules while maintaining crystallinity. Dielectric measurements showed dielectric relaxation due to molecular motion of polar guest molecules (Tol and ClBz) in the host lattice formed by molecule 2. In particular, crystals containing ClBz exhibited rotational dynamics of guest molecules with increasing temperature. These results provide important insights for the design of flexible porous materials using halogen&#183;&#183;&#183;halogen interactions and the creation of dielectric materials based on guest molecule dynamics.

         <title>MnOX&#8208;CeO2 Bimetal Oxides Derived from Ce&#8208;Based MOFs as a Synergistic Catalyst Boost the Aerobic Oxidative Dehydrogenation of N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesized bimetallic oxides MnOX&#8208;CeO2 by the pyrolysis of Mn/Ce&#8208;BTC MOFs have been employed as a heterogenous catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of N&#8208;heterocycles to N&#8208;heteroaromatics with oxygen as the solo oxidant.








Abstract
The development of synthetic methods for N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds have garnered considerable attention due to their significance in diverse chemical processes. Among various synthesis methods, the direct oxidative dehydrogenation of saturated substances to N&#8208;heteroaromatics is a simple and efficient method. This study utilized the pyrolysis of Mn/Ce&#8208;BTC MOFs precursor to prepare MnOX&#8208;CeO2 composites as a heterogeneous catalyst for the aerobic oxidative dehydrogenation of N&#8208;heterocycles. The MnOX&#8208;CeO2 composites were analyzed with various characterization techniques including XRD, SEM, TEM, BET, XPS, ICP&#8208;OES and Raman spectroscopy. The detailed findings from experiments indicate that the catalytic activity of the composites has been significantly improved due to the synergistic effect of MnOX&#8208;CeO2 and the abundant oxygen vacancies on the surface of the catalyst. And the related mechanism experiments reveal that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in this catalytic system. Furthermore, MnOX&#8208;CeO2 composites retain excellent catalytic performance even after ten recycles.

         <dc:description>
A systematic co&#8208;crystallization&#8208;study of a tridentate ortho&#8208;carborane&#8208;based halogen&#8208;bond donor with halides was performed. Several association complexes are evaluated to give further insights into the halogen bond&#8208;strength of this moiety. For iodide, rare octahedral coordination via a sandwich&#8208;like complexation was observed in the solid state when using non&#8208;coordinating and &#8220;electron&#8208;rich&#8221; cations. This is to our knowledge the first such coordination by halogen&#8208;bonding multidentate receptors.
 








Abstract
We recently introduced multidentate halogen&#8208;bonding receptors based on C&#8208;iodinated ortho&#8208;Carborane moieties. Following up on our results in solution, which indicated a second binding event for sub&#8208;stochiometric concentrations of halide guests, we herein present a systematic co&#8208;crystallization study with halides to further evaluate the halogen&#8208;bonding capacities of these halogen&#8208;bonding catalysts. The obtained solid&#8208;state structures include two rare examples of octahedral coordination via halogen bonding of a halide ion by a pair of tridentate receptors.
