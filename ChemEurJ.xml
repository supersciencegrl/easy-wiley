         <title>Analysis of Non&#8208;innocence of Phosphaquinodimethane Ligands when Charge and Aromaticity Come into Play</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Several phosphaquinodimethanes and their M(CO)5 complexes (M = Cr, Mo, W) and model derivatives have been theoretically investigated regarding the quest of non&#8208;innocence. Computed structural and electronic properties of the P&#8208;Me/NH2 substituted phosphaquinodimethanes and tungsten complexes revealed an interesting non&#8208;innocent ligand behaviour for the radical anion complexes with distonic ion character and a strong rearomatization of the middle phenyl ring. The latter was further probed taking also geometric aromaticity (HOMA) and quinoid distortion parameters, (HOMQc) into account, as well as NICS(1). Furthermore, the effect of the P&#8208;substitution was investigated for real (or plausible) complexes and their free ligands focusing on the resulting aromaticity at the middle phenyl ring and vertical one&#8208;electron redox processes. The best picture of ligand engagement in redox changes was provided by representing NICS(1) values versus HOMA and the new geometric distortion parameter HOMQc8.</dc:description>

         <title>Design and Synthesis of new Withaferin A inspired Hedgehog pathway inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Withanolides constitute a well&#8208;known family of plant&#8208;based alkaloids characterised by widespread biological properties, including the ability of interfering with Hedgehog (Hh) signalling pathway. Following our interest in natural products and in anticancer compounds, we report here the synthesis of a new class of Hh signalling pathway inhibitors, inspired by withaferin A, the first isolated member of withanolides. The decoration of our scaffolds was rationally supported by  in silico  studies, while functional evaluation revealed promising candidates, confirming once again the importance of natural products as inspiration source for the discovery of novel bioactive compounds. A stereoselective approach, based on Brown chemistry, allowed the obtainment and the functional evaluation of the enantiopure hit compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>CO2 Capture by Hydroxylated Azine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent Organic Frameworks RIO&#8208;13, RIO&#8208;12, RIO&#8208;11, and RIO&#8208;11m were investigated towards their CO2 capture properties by thermogravimetric analysis at 1 atm and 40 &#176;C. These microporous COFs bear in common the azine backbone composed of hydroxy&#8208;benzene moieties but differ in the relative number of hydroxyl groups present in each material. Thus, their sorption capacities were studied as a function of their textural and chemical properties. Their maximum CO2 uptake values showed a strong correlation with an increasing specific surface area, but that property alone could not fully explain the CO2 uptake data. Hence, the specific CO2 uptake, combined with DFT calculations, indicated that the relative number of hydroxyl groups in the COF backbone acts as an adsorption threshold, as the hydroxyl groups were indeed identified as relevant adsorption sites in all the studied COFs. Additionally, the best performing COF was thoroughly investigated, experimentally and theoretically, for its CO2 capture properties in a variety of CO2 concentrations and temperatures, and showed excellent isothermal recyclability up to 3 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA&#8208;encoded Libraries: Hydrazide as a Pluripotent Precursor for on&#8208;DNA Synthesis of Various Azole Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA&#8208;encoded combinatorial chemical library (DEL) technology, an approach that combines the power of genetics and chemistry, has emerged as an invaluable tool in drug discovery. Skeletal diversity plays a fundamental importance in DEL applications, and relies heavily on novel DNA&#8208;compatible chemical reactions. We report herein a phylogenic chemical transformation strategy using DNA&#8208;conjugated benzoyl hydrazine as a common versatile precursor in azole chemical expansion of DELs. DNA&#8208;compatible reactions deriving from the common benzoyl hydrazine precursor showed excellent functional group tolerance with exceptional efficiency in the synthesis of various azoles, including oxadiazoles, thiadiazoles, and triazoles, under mild reaction conditions. The phylogenic chemical transformation strategy provides DELs a facile way to expand into various unique chemical spaces with privileged scaffolds and pharmacophores.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalency in Actinide Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 19, Page 5835-5841, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organometallics tricks for actinide extended structures: Covalency in actinide complexes has long been studied for both its fundamental interest and potential applications for minor actinides separation. In this concept paper, covalency in actinides is introduced and illustrated with several examples from the current literature. It is shown that actinide chalcogenide extended structures may serve as auxiliary platforms for studying covalency.







Abstract
Covalency in actinides has emerged as a resounding research topic on account of the technological importance in separating minor actinides from lanthanides for spent nuclear fuel processing, and utilization of their distinct bonding properties has been realized as a route towards overcoming this challenge. Because of the limited radial extent of the 4f orbitals, there is almost no 4f electron participation in bonding in lanthanides; this is not the case for the actinides, which have extended 5f orbitals that are capable of overlapping with ligand orbitals, although not to the degree of overlap as in the d orbitals of transition metals. In this concept paper, a general description of covalency in actinide compounds is provided. After introducing two main approaches to enhance covalency, either by exploiting increased orbital overlap or decreasing energy differences between the orbitals causing orbital energy degeneracy, the current state of the field is illustrated by using several examples from the recent literature. This paper is concluded by proposing the use of actinide chalcogenides as a convenient auxiliary tool to study covalency in actinide compounds.

         <title>Azobioisosteres of Curcumin with Pronounced Activity against Amyloid Aggregation, Intracellular Oxidative Stress, and Neuroinflammation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 19, Page 6015-6027, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Improving on nature: Synthetic bioisosteres of the natural product curcumin are designed, synthesized, and computationally evaluated by molecular dynamics and replica&#8208;exchange molecular dynamics simulations for their interaction with amyloid&#8208;&#946; 42 aggregation. Biological evaluation shows that such compounds greatly exceed the anti&#8208;neuroinflammatory and neuroprotective properties of their parent compounds.







Abstract
Many (poly&#8208;)phenolic natural products, for example, curcumin and taxifolin, have been studied for their activity against specific hallmarks of neurodegeneration, such as amyloid&#8208;&#946; 42 (A&#946;42) aggregation and neuroinflammation. Due to their drawbacks, arising from poor pharmacokinetics, rapid metabolism, and even instability in aqueous medium, the biological activity of azobenzene compounds carrying a pharmacophoric catechol group, which have been designed as bioisoteres of curcumin has been examined. Molecular simulations reveal the ability of these compounds to form a hydrophobic cluster with A&#946;42, which adopts different folds, affecting the propensity to populate fibril&#8208;like conformations. Furthermore, the curcumin bioisosteres exceeded the parent compound in activity against A&#946;42 aggregation inhibition, glutamate&#8208;induced intracellular oxidative stress in HT22 cells, and neuroinflammation in microglial BV&#8208;2 cells. The most active compound prevented apoptosis of HT22 cells at a concentration of 2.5&#8197;&#956;m (83&#8201;% cell survival), whereas curcumin only showed very low protection at 10&#8197;&#956;m (21&#8201;% cell survival).

The most active compound prevented apoptosis of HT22 cells at a concentration of 2.5&#8197;&#956;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; (83&#8201;% cell survival), whereas curcumin only showed very low protection at 10&#8197;&#956;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; (21&#8201;% cell survival).&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>How the Physicochemical Properties of the Bulk Material Affect the Ablation Crater Profile, Mass Balance, and Bubble Dynamics During Single&#8208;Pulse, Nanosecond Laser Ablation in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 19, Page 5978-5991, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The early cavitation bubble timescales of ablation of gold and aluminum targets in water are illustrated. It is evident that intensive chemical reactions occur depending on the oxidation sensitivity of the ablated material leading to different ablation depths during single pulse nanosecond laser ablation in liquids.







Abstract
Understanding the key steps that drive the laser&#8208;based synthesis of colloids is a prerequisite for learning how to optimize the ablation process in terms of nanoparticle output and functional design of the nanomaterials. Even though many studies focus on cavitation bubble formation using single&#8208;pulse ablation conditions, the ablation efficiency and nanoparticle properties are typically investigated under prolonged ablation conditions with repetition rate lasers. Linking single&#8208;pulse and multiple&#8208;pulse ablation is difficult due to limitations induced by gas formation cross&#8208;effects, which occur on longer timescales and depend on the target materials&#8217; oxidation&#8208;sensitivity. Therefore, this study investigates the ablation and cavitation bubble dynamics under nanosecond, single laser pulse conditions for six different bulk materials (Au, Ag, Cu, Fe, Ti, and Al). Also, the effective threshold fluences, ablation volumes, and penetration depths are quantified for these materials. The thermal and chemical properties of the corresponding bulk materials not only favor the formation of larger spot sizes but also lead to the highest molar ablation efficiencies for low melting materials such as aluminum. Furthermore, the concept of the cavitation bubble growth linked with the oxidation sensitivity of the ablated material is discussed. With this, evidence is provided that intensive chemical reactions occurring during the very early timescale of ablation are significantly enhanced by the bubble collapse.

         <title>Polymorphs of the Gadolinite&#8208;Type Borates ZrB2O5 and HfB2O5 Under Extreme Pressure</title>

Push the boundaries: The behavior of &#946;&#8208;HfB2O5 and &#946;&#8208;ZrB2O5 under extreme pressure up to 120&#8197;GPa has been studied by synchrotron&#8208;based in situ high&#8208;pressure X&#8208;ray diffraction in a diamond anvil cell. Both compounds remain stable to the highest applied pressure and for both experiments, a second additional phase, named &#947;&#8208;HfB2O5 and &#947;&#8208;ZrB2O5, respectively, was found at pressures above 114&#8197;GPa.







Abstract
Based on the results from previous high&#8208;pressure experiments on the gadolinite&#8208;type mineral datolite, CaBSiO4(OH), the behavior of the isostructural borates &#946;&#8208;HfB2O5 and &#946;&#8208;ZrB2O5 have been studied by synchrotron&#8208;based in situ high&#8208;pressure single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments. On compression to 120&#8197;GPa, both borate layer&#8208;structures are preserved. Additionally, at &#8776;114&#8197;GPa, the formation of a second phase can be observed in both compounds. The new high&#8208;pressure modification &#947;&#8208;ZrB2O5 features a rearrangement of the corner&#8208;sharing BO4 tetrahedra, while still maintaining the four&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered rings. The new phase &#947;&#8208;HfB2O5 contains ten&#8208;membered rings including the rare structural motif of edge&#8208;sharing BO4 tetrahedra with exceptionally short B&#8722;O and B&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;B distances. For both structures, unusually high coordination numbers are found for the transition metal cations, with ninefold coordinated Hf4+, and tenfold coordinated Zr4+, respectively. These findings remarkably show the potential of cold compression as a low&#8208;energy pathway to discover metastable structures that exhibit new coordinations and structural motifs.

         <title>Small Figure&#8208;Eight Luminophores: Double&#8208;Twisted Tethered Cyclic Binaphthyls Boost Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 19, Page 5923-5929, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of figure&#8208;eight&#8208;shaped cyclic naphthalenes with different tethers were synthesized, and their CPL properties were investigated. Compounds with short tether showed remarkable boosting of the glum (0.010&#8211;0.016). The proximate figure&#8208;eight luminophore promotes elongation of the magnetic transition dipole moment that results in significant increases in glum.







Abstract
Double&#8208;twisted cyclic binaphthyls, in which two naphthalenes are tethered by &#8208;O(CH2)nO&#8208; linkage (n=1&#8211;3), have been synthesized. X&#8208;ray analyses and DFT calculations revealed a tightly constrained stereogenic figure&#8208;eight geometry. Tethering of two naphthalenes by short linkage forces a small dihedral angle, and the cyclic binaphthyls with short tether (n=1, 2) exhibit remarkable boosting of the glum value (1.0&#8211;1.6&#215;10&#8722;2) in circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and unusual glum/gabs ratios (0.93&#8211;1.3). These experimental high |glum| values are in accord with the results of excited state TD&#8208;DFT calculations, which show transannular interactions and that consequent extensive delocalization occurs throughout the figure&#8208;eight &#960;&#8208;core. As a result, the present figure&#8208;eight luminophore promote the elongation of the magnetic transition dipole moment that results in significant increases in glum values.

         <title>Triggering G&#8208;Quadruplex Conformation Switching with [7]Helicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 19, Page 6064-6069, April 1, 2021. </description>

Stabilized by flexibility: Heterocyclic [7]helicenes and DNA strands prone to fold into G&#8208;quadruplex structures interact with and stabilise each other, mutually amplifying and stabilising certain conformations at increased temperatures. The [7]helicene ligands stabilise the parallel conformation of k&#8208;ras significantly, whereas hybrid (K+) and antiparallel (Na+) h&#8208;telo G&#8208;quadruplexes are stabilised upon conformational switching into altered G&#8208;quadruplex conformations.







Abstract
The dynamic interplay between two types of chiral structures; fully conjugated racemic hetero[7]helicenes and DNA strands prone to fold into G&#8208;quadruplex structures is described. Both the [7]helicenes and the G&#8208;quadruplex DNA structures exist in more than one conformation in solution. We show that the structures interact with and stabilise each other, mutually amplifying and stabilising certain conformations at increased temperatures. The [7]helicene ligands L1 and L2 stabilise the parallel conformation of k&#8208;ras significantly, whereas hybrid (K+) and antiparallel (Na+) h&#8208;telo G&#8208;quadruplexes are stabilised upon conformational switching into altered G&#8208;quadruplex conformations. Both L1 and L2 induce parallel G&#8208;quadruplexes from hybrid structures (K+) and L1 induces hybrid G&#8208;quadruplexes from antiparallel conformations (Na+). Enantioselective binding of one helicene enantiomer is observed for helicene ligand L2, and VTCD melting experiments are used to estimate the racemisation barrier of the helicene.

The [7]helicene ligands stabilise the parallel conformation of &lt;i&gt;k&#8208;ras&lt;/i&gt; significantly, whereas hybrid (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and antiparallel (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) &lt;i&gt;h&#8208;telo&lt;/i&gt; G&#8208;quadruplexes are stabilised upon conformational switching into altered G&#8208;quadruplex conformations.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dynamic interplay between two types of chiral structures; fully conjugated racemic hetero[7]helicenes and DNA strands prone to fold into G&#8208;quadruplex structures is described. Both the [7]helicenes and the G&#8208;quadruplex DNA structures exist in more than one conformation in solution. We show that the structures interact with and stabilise each other, mutually amplifying and stabilising certain conformations at increased temperatures. The [7]helicene ligands &lt;b&gt;L1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;L2&lt;/b&gt; stabilise the parallel conformation of &lt;i&gt;k&#8208;ras&lt;/i&gt; significantly, whereas hybrid (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and antiparallel (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) &lt;i&gt;h&#8208;telo&lt;/i&gt; G&#8208;quadruplexes are stabilised upon conformational switching into altered G&#8208;quadruplex conformations. Both &lt;b&gt;L1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;L2&lt;/b&gt; induce parallel G&#8208;quadruplexes from hybrid structures (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and &lt;b&gt;L1&lt;/b&gt; induces hybrid G&#8208;quadruplexes from antiparallel conformations (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). Enantioselective binding of one helicene enantiomer is observed for helicene ligand &lt;b&gt;L2&lt;/b&gt;, and VTCD melting experiments are used to estimate the racemisation barrier of the helicene.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>The Supramolecular Structural Chemistry of Pentafluorosulfanyl and Tetrafluorosulfanylene Compounds</title>

Molecules containing SF5 or SF4 groups show a diverse solid&#8208;state structural chemistry, including supramolecular dimers or polymers formed by F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F or other F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X contacts.







Abstract
The analysis of crystal structures of SF5&#8208; or SF4&#8208;containing molecules revealed that these groups are often surrounded by hydrogen or other fluorine atoms. Even though fluorine prefers F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H over F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F contacts, the latter appeared to be important in many compounds. In a significant number of datasets, the closest F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F contacts are below 95&#8201;% of the van der Waals distance of two F atoms. Moreover, a number of repeating structural motifs formed by contacts between SF5 groups was identified, including different supramolecular dimers and infinite chains. Among SF4&#8208;containing molecules, the study focused on SF4Cl compounds, including the first solid&#8208;state structure analyses of these reactive species. Additionally, electrostatic potential surfaces of a series of Ph&#8208;SF5 derivatives were calculated, pointing out the substituent influence on the ability of F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X contact formation (X=F or other electronegative atom). Interaction energies were calculated for different dimeric arrangements of Ph&#8208;SF5, which were extracted from experimental crystal structure determinations.

         <title>Synthesis and Evaluation of Novel Ring&#8208;Strained Noncanonical Amino Acids for Residue&#8208;Specific Bioorthogonal Reactions in Living Cells</title>

How do they click? A high throughput fluorescence flow cytometry&#8208;based FRET assay enables us to directly measure bioorthogonal reaction kinetics in living cells. Using this assay, we test several new compounds and identify well suited strained dienophiles for genetic code expansion experiments to site&#8208;specifically label proteins in vivo.







Abstract
Bioorthogonal reactions are ideally suited to selectively modify proteins in complex environments, even in vivo. Kinetics and product stability of these reactions are crucial parameters to evaluate their usefulness for specific applications. Strain promoted inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder cycloadditions (SPIEDAC) between tetrazines and strained alkenes or alkynes are particularly popular, as they allow ultrafast labeling inside cells. In combination with genetic code expansion (GCE)&#8208;a method that allows to incorporate noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) site&#8208;specifically into proteins in vivo. These reactions enable residue&#8208;specific fluorophore attachment to proteins in living mammalian cells. Several SPIEDAC capable ncAAs have been presented and studied under diverse conditions, revealing different instabilities ranging from educt decomposition to product loss due to &#946;&#8208;elimination. To identify which compounds yield the best labeling inside living mammalian cells has frequently been difficult. In this study we present a)&#8197;the synthesis of four new SPIEDAC reactive ncAAs that cannot undergo &#946;&#8208;elimination and b)&#8197;a fluorescence flow cytometry based FRET&#8208;assay to measure reaction kinetics inside living cells. Our results, which at first sight can be seen conflicting with some other studies, capture GCE&#8208;specific experimental conditions, such as long&#8208;term exposure of the ring&#8208;strained ncAA to living cells, that are not taken into account in other assays.

         <title>A Comparative Study on the Photophysical Properties of Anthocyanins and Pyranoanthocyanins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 19, Page 5956-5971, April 1, 2021. </description>

Anthocyanins vs. pyranoanthocyanins: The photophysical properties of 140 naturally derived anthocyanins were systematically evaluated by density functional theory (DFT) and its time&#8208;dependent variant (TD&#8208;DFT). The data provide insights into the structure&#8211;photophysical property relationship of these compounds and allow target&#8208;specific solutions in real&#8208;life applications such as food additives/colorants, textile dyes, reference analytical standards, and dye sensitizers.







Abstract
Anthocyanins and pyranoanthocyanins are flavonoids that are present in various food products (e.g., fruit, vegetables, wine, etc.). The large chemical diversity amongst these molecules leads to compound&#8208;specific properties such as color and stability towards external conditions. These properties are also attractive for food and non&#8208;food applications. The photophysical experimental characterization is not easy as this generally demands advanced analytical techniques along with optimized separation procedures. Molecular modeling can provide insights into the fundamental understanding of the photophysical properties of these compounds in a uniform way for a broad set of compounds. However, the current literature is quite fragmented on this topic. Herein, a large set of 140 naturally derived anthocyanins was evaluated in a systematic way with three functionals (B3LYP, PBE0, and CAM&#8208;B3LYP). The accuracy of these functionals was determined with experimental literature &#955;max,vis values. In addition to &#955;max,vis values, time&#8208;dependent (TD)&#8208;DFT calculations also provided oscillator strengths, molar absorption coefficients, and orbital energies, which define whether specific natural anthocyanin&#8208;based compounds can be deployed in food and non&#8208;food applications such as food additives/colorants, textile dyeing, analytical standards, and dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).

         <title>Electrochemically Enabled One&#8208;Pot Multistep Synthesis of C19 Androgen Steroids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 19, Page 6044-6049, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical manipulation of corticosteroids has enabled the preparation of important C19 steroids via removal of the C17 side chain. The reagent&#8208;free electrochemical method permitted several one&#8208;pot multistep syntheses of androgens. Simultaneous anodic oxidation and cathodic catalytic hydrogenation of corticosteroids for the generation of saturated androgens has also been established.







Abstract
The synthesis of many valuable C19 androgens can be accomplished by removal of the C17 side chain from more abundant corticosteroids, followed by further derivatization of the resulting 17&#8208;keto derivative. Conventional chemical reagents pose significant drawbacks for this synthetic strategy, as large amounts of waste are generated, and quenching of the reaction mixture and purification of the 17&#8208;ketosteroid intermediate are typically required. Herein, we present mild, safe, and sustainable electrochemical strategies for the preparation of C19 steroids. A reagent and catalyst free protocol for the removal of the C17 side chain of corticosteroids via anodic oxidation has been developed, enabling several one&#8208;pot, multistep procedures for the synthesis of androgen steroids. In addition, simultaneous anodic C17 side chain cleavage and cathodic catalytic hydrogenation of a steroid has been demonstrated, rendering a convenient and highly atom economic procedure for the synthesis of saturated androgens.

         <title>Metastability and Seeding Effects in the Mechanochemical Hybrid Lead(II) Iodide Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 19, Page 5944-5955, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Comprehensive in situ investigations allow for the formulation of a mechanism for the mechanochemical formation of two hybrid lead iodides. Via mechanochemistry or temperature the metastable compound can be stabilized. Its formation is strongly correlated with the formation of the second compound, which can be influenced by seeding.







Abstract
The mechanism for the mechanochemical synthesis of (C(NH2)3)3PbI5 3 and (C(NH2)3)4PbI6 4 and their conversion into each other is presented. We investigated the synthesis of 3 at different frequencies and energies using in situ powder X&#8208;ray diffraction. By splitting the reaction into single parts we could prove that the formation of 3 is simply dependent on the energy and mixing speed. The nucleation of 4 instead is slightly negative dependent on the energy but dependent on the mixing speed, while its growth is mostly independent of any influence. We were able to influence the reaction pathways by seeding the mixture with a small amount of powdery 4. The formation of 4 is very likely an auto&#8208;catalytic process. 3 instead is metastable. It can be stabilized by energy, which beside mechanochemistry can also be achieved by temperature. The results showcases the complex nature of mechanochemical reactions.

Tetramethyl Rhodamine (TMR) is out of fashion? Fluorescent TMR&#8208;clones containing a 6&#8208;chloronicotinic acid residue were synthesized, attached to ligands and applied for selective and vital labelling of intracellular targets. Superresolution STED microscopy in one&#8208; and two&#8208;colors demonstrated high optical resolution and target specificity of the good old TMR scaffold.







Abstract
Formylation of 2,6&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5&#8208;R&#8208;nicotinic acids at C&#8208;4 followed by condensation with 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethylaniline gave analogs of the popular TAMRA fluorescent dye with a 2,6&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5&#8208;R&#8208;nicotinic acid residues (R=H, F). The following reaction with thioglycolic acid is selective, involves only one chlorine atom at the carbon between pyridine nitrogen and the carboxylic acid group and affords new rhodamine dyes absorbing at 564/ 573&#8197;nm and emitting at 584/ 597&#8197;nm (R=H/ F, in aq. PBS). Conjugates of the dyes with &#8220;small molecules&#8221; provided specific labeling (covalent and non&#8208;covalent) of organelles as well as of components of the cytoskeleton in living cells and were combined with fluorescent probes prepared from 610CP and SiR dyes and applied in two&#8208;color STED microscopy with a 775&#8197;nm STED laser.

         <title>Iron Catalyzed Double Bond Isomerization: Evidence for an FeI/FeIII Catalytic Cycle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 19, Page 5972-5977, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using deuterium labelling, electrochemistry, EPR and DFT, an iron catalyzed double bond isomerization reaction was disclosed that is likely to proceed through on&#8208;cycle FeI and FeIII intermediates. The reaction uses an FeII pre&#8208;catalyst that undergoes a one&#8208;electron reduction to get to the first on&#8208;cycle species. These studies on mechanism, along with synthetic scope of the reaction, are presented.







Abstract
Iron&#8208;catalyzed isomerization of alkenes is reported using an iron(II) &#946;&#8208;diketiminate pre&#8208;catalyst. The reaction proceeds with a catalytic amount of a hydride source, such as pinacol borane (HBpin) or ammonia borane (H3N&#8901;BH3). Reactivity with both allyl arenes and aliphatic alkenes has been studied. The catalytic mechanism was investigated by a variety of means, including deuteration studies, Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The data obtained support a pre&#8208;catalyst activation step that gives access to an &#951;2&#8208;coordinated alkene FeI complex, followed by oxidative addition of the alkene to give an FeIII intermediate, which then undergoes reductive elimination to allow release of the isomerization product.

         <title>Endohedral Hydrogen Bonding Templates the Formation of a Highly Strained Covalent Organic Cage Compound**

Cages put under tension: Endohedral hydrogen bonding stabilizes a highly strained covalent organic cage compound. The introduction of carboxylic acid groups at the concave side of a curved diboronic acid linker switches cage geometry from tetrahedral [4+6] to trigonal&#8208;bipyramidal [2+3] assembly. Thermodynamic stability and kinetic preorganization of early intermediates have been analyzed by DFT calculations.







Abstract
A highly strained covalent organic cage compound was synthesized from hexahydroxy tribenzotriquinacene (TBTQ) and a meta&#8208;terphenyl&#8208;based diboronic acid with an additional benzoic acid substituent in 2&#8217;&#8208;position. Usually, a 120&#176; bite angle in the unsubstituted ditopic linker favors the formation of a [4+6] cage assembly. Here, the introduction of the benzoic acid group is shown to lead to a perfectly preorganized circular hydrogen&#8208;bonding array in the cavity of a trigonal&#8208;bipyramidal [2+3] cage, which energetically overcompensates the additional strain energy caused by the larger mismatch in bite angles for the smaller assembly. The strained cage compound was analyzed by mass spectrometry and 1H, 13C and DOSY NMR spectroscopy. DFT calculations revealed the energetic contribution of the hydrogen&#8208;bonding template to the cage stability. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations on early intermediates indicate an additional kinetic effect, as hydrogen bonding also preorganizes and rigidifies small oligomers to facilitate the exclusive formation of smaller and more strained macrocycles and cages.

         <title>Reactivity of Single Transition Metal Atoms on a Hydroxylated Amorphous Silica Surface: A Periodic Conceptual DFT Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 19, Page 6050-6063, April 1, 2021. </description>

SAC reactivity from theory: A periodic conceptual DFT investigation elucidating the nature of the adsorption and catalytic activity of single silica&#8208;supported late transition metal atoms was undertaken revealing the evidence of a strong correlation with experimental data and chemical properties.







Abstract
The drive to develop maximal atom&#8208;efficient catalysts coupled to the continuous striving for more sustainable reactions has led to an ever&#8208;increasing interest in single&#8208;atom catalysis.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SAC reactivity from theory&lt;/b&gt;: A periodic conceptual DFT investigation elucidating the nature of the adsorption and catalytic activity of single silica&#8208;supported late transition metal atoms was undertaken revealing the evidence of a strong correlation with experimental data and chemical properties.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drive to develop maximal atom&#8208;efficient catalysts coupled to the continuous striving for more sustainable reactions has led to an ever&#8208;increasing interest in single&#8208;atom catalysis. Based on a periodic conceptual density functional theory (cDFT) approach, fundamental insights into the reactivity and adsorption of single late transition metal atoms supported on a fully hydroxylated amorphous silica surface have been acquired. In particular, this investigation revealed that the influence of van der Waals dispersion forces is especially significant for a silver (98&#8201;%) or gold (78&#8201;%) atom, whereas the oxophilicity of the Group 8&#8211;10 transition metals plays a major role in the interaction strength of these atoms on the irreducible SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; support. The adsorption energies for the less&#8208;electronegative row 4 elements (Fe, Co, Ni) ranged from &#8722;1.40 to &#8722;1.92&#8197;eV, whereas for the heavier row 5 and 6 metals, with the exception of Pd, these values are between &#8722;2.20 and &#8722;2.92&#8197;eV.

         <title>Computational Insights into Different Mechanisms for Ag&#8208;, Cu&#8208;, and Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclopropanation of Alkenes and Sulfonyl Hydrazones</title>

Barriers to reaction: The [2+1] cycloaddition reaction of a metal carbene with an alkene is investigated through DFT calculations. Efficient cyclopropanation by the silver catalyst is attributed to the barrierless concerted cycloaddition step, and the kinetic inhibition of side reaction by a high concentration of alkene.







Abstract
The [2+1] cycloaddition reaction of a metal carbene with an alkene can produce important cyclopropane products for synthetic intermediates, materials, and pharmaceutical applications. However, this reaction is often accompanied by side reactions, such as coupling and self&#8208;coupling, so that the yield of the cyclopropanation product of non&#8208;silver transition&#8208;metal carbenes and hindered alkenes is generally lower than 50&#8201;%. To solve this problem, the addition of a low concentration of diazo compound (decomposition of sulfonyl hydrazones) to alkenes catalyzed by either CuOAc or PdCl2 was studied, but side reactions could still not be avoided. Interestingly, however, the yield of cyclopropanation products for such hindered alkenes were as high as 99&#8201;% with AgOTf as a catalyst. To explain this unexpected phenomenon, reaction pathways have been computed for four different catalysts by using DFT. By combining the results of these calculations with those obtained experimentally, it can be concluded that the efficiency of the silver catalyst is due to the barrierless concerted cycloaddition step and the kinetic inhibition of side reactions by a high concentration of alkene.

         <title>Crystal Structure and Ferroelectric Evidence of BaZnSi3O8, a&#8201;Low&#8208;Permittivity Microwave Dielectric Ceramic</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 19, Page 5992-5998, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microwave dielectric ceramics: The crystal structure information of BaZnSi3O8 ceramic is reported for the first time. The single&#8208;phase BaZnSi3O8 ceramic was fully validated by XRD and synchrotron studies. In addition, the coexistence of microwave dielectric properties (&#1013;r=6.55, Q&#215;f=52400&#8197;GHz, and &#964;f=&#8722;24.5) and weak ferroelectricity were discovered in the BaZnSi3O8 ceramic.







Abstract
BaZnSi3O8 ceramic was prepared by the conventional solid&#8208;state method and sintered at 1100&#8201;&#176;C. XRD and synchrotron Rietveld refinement analyses revealed the BaZnSi3O8 ceramic presented a monoclinic structure with a space group of P21/a (No.14), which is reported for the first time. The BaZnSi3O8 ceramic presented a weak ferroelectricity, which was confirmed by the P&#8211;E loop and the 90&#176; nanoscale ferroelectric domain. Although &#1013;r&#8211;T displayed two &#1013;r abnormal peaks at 400&#8201;&#176;C and 460&#8201;&#176;C, the Curie temperature (Tc) was located at 460&#8201;&#176;C according to the dielectric loss and Curie&#8211;Weiss law. Moreover, the BaZnSi3O8 ceramic exhibited optimized microwave dielectric properties with &#1013;r=6.55, Q&#215;f=52400&#8197;GHz, and &#964;f=&#8722;24.5&#8197;ppm/&#176;C. Hence, the BaZnSi3O8 ceramic in the ternary BaO&#8208;ZnO&#8208;SiO2 system possessed both weak ferroelectricity and microwave dielectric properties. These results are expected to break the technical barrier of ferroelectric phase shifter applications in microwave and even millimeter&#8208;wave frequency bands.

         <title>The Role of the &#8722;OH Groups within Mn12 Clusters in Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 19, Page 6034-6043, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new water&#8208;soluble Mn12 clusters, 3,4DHMn12 and 2,3DHMn12, were synthesized and explored in order to understand whether the &#8722;OH substituents on the benzoate ligands within these Mn12 clusters play a role in the catalytic water oxidation process. We showed that depending on their location on the aromatic ring, the hydroxyl substituents can either contribute (meta, para) or hamper (ortho) electrocatalytic water oxidation.







Abstract
The formidable reactivity of the oxygen&#8208;evolving center near photosystem II is largely based on its protein environment that stabilizes it during catalysis. Inspired by this concept, the water&#8208;soluble Mn12 clusters Mn12O12(O2CC6H3(OH)2)16(H2O)4 (3,5DHMn12) and Mn12O12(O2CC6H3(OH)3)16(H2O)4 (3,4,5THMn12) were developed as efficient electrocatalysts for water oxidation. In this work, the role of the &#8722;OH groups in the electrocatalytic process was explored by describing the structural and electrocatalytic properties of two new Mn12 clusters, 3,4DHMn12 and 2,3DHMn12, having one &#8722;OH group in the meta position relative to the benzoate&#8208;Mn moiety, and one at the para or ortho position, respectively. The Mn centers in 3,4DHMn12 were discovered to have lower oxidation potential compared with those in 2,3DHMn12, and thus, 3,4DHMn12 can catalyze water oxidation with higher rate and TON than 2,3DHMn12. Hence, the role of the &#8722;OH groups in the electrocatalysis was established, being involved in electronic stabilization of the Mn centers or in proton shuttling.

         <title>(Trifluoromethylselenyl)methylchalcogenyl as Emerging Fluorinated Groups: Synthesis under Photoredox Catalysis and Determination of the Lipophilicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 19, Page 6028-6033, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
New, highly lipophilic, fluorinated groups: Through an easy two&#8208;step procedure, with photoredox&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylation key step, molecules with (trifluoromethylselenyl)methylchalcogenyl groups can be easily obtained. These new innovative substituents are among the highest lipophilic fluorinated moieties.







Abstract
The synthesis of molecules bearing (trifluoromethylselenyl)methylchalcogenyl groups is described via an efficient two&#8208;step strategy based on a metal&#8208;free photoredox catalyzed decarboxylative trifluoromethylselenolation with good yields up to 88&#8201;%, which raised to 98&#8201;% in flow chemistry conditions. The flow methods allowed also to scale up the reaction. The mechanism of this key reaction was studied. The physicochemical characterization of these emerging groups was performed by determining their Hansch&#8211;Leo lipophilicity parameters with high values up to 2.24. This reaction was also extended to perfluoroalkylselenolation with yields up to 95&#8201;%. Finally, this method was successfully applied to the functionalization of relevant bioactive molecules such as tocopherol or estrone derivatives.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Promoted Fluorination Reactions of &#945;&#8208;Bromoamides</title>

Doubly inverted: Silver&#8208;promoted fluorination of &#945;&#8208;bromoamides proceeds under mild conditions via an aziridinone intermediate with double inversion of configuration. This approach can provide a variety of fluorinated products with high yield, chemoselectivity, and stereospecificity.







Abstract
Silver&#8208;promoted C&#8722;F bond formation in &#945;&#8208;bromoamides by using AgF under mild conditions is reported. This simple method enables access to tertiary, secondary, and primary alkyl fluorides involving biomolecular scaffolds. This transformation is applicable to primary and secondary amides and shows broad functional&#8208;group tolerance. Kinetics experiments revealed that the reaction rate increased in the order of 3&#176;&gt;2&#176;&gt;1&#176; &#945;&#8208;carbon atom. In addition, it was found that the acidic amide proton plays an important role in accelerating the reaction. Mechanistic studies suggested generation of an aziridinone intermediate that undergoes subsequent nucleophilic addition to form the C&#8722;F bond with stereospecificity (i.e., retention of configuration). The synthesis of sterically hindered alcohols and ethers by using AgI is also demonstrated. Examples of reactions of &#945;&#8208;bromoamides with O nucleophiles are presented.

         <title>Synthesis of Morpholine&#8208;Based Analogues of (&#8722;)&#8208;Zampanolide and Their Biological Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 19, Page 5936-5943, April 1, 2021. </description>

Opening up activity: A synthetic approach has been developed towards a new class of analogues of the marine macrolide (&#8722;)&#8208;zampanolide. The morpholine core replacing the tetrahydropyran ring was elaborated from epoxides and tosyl amide. The macrocycle was closed by a HWE reaction, and a stereoselective aza&#8208;aldol reaction installed the sorbamide&#8208;derived side chain. Two analogues showed nm antiproliferative activity.







Abstract
We describe the convergent synthesis of three prototypical examples of a new class of analogues of the complex, cytotoxic marine macrolide (&#8722;)&#8208;zampanolide that incorporate an embedded N&#8208;substituted morpholine moiety in place of the natural tetrahydropyran ring. The final construction of the macrolactone core was based on a high&#8208;yielding intramolecular HWE olefination, while the hemiaminal&#8208;linked side chain was elaborated through a stereoselective, BINAL&#8208;H&#8208;mediated addition of (Z,E)&#8208;sorbamide to a macrocyclic aldehyde precursor. The synthesis of the common functionalized morpholine building block involved two consecutive epoxide openings with tosylamide and the product of the first opening reaction, respectively, as nucleophiles. Of the three morpholino&#8208;zampanolides investigated, the N&#8208;acetyl and the N&#8208;benzoyl derivatives both exhibited nanomolar antiproliferative activity, thus being essentially equipotent with the natural product. In contrast, the activity of the N&#8208;tosyl derivative was significantly reduced.

         <dc:description>
Thermodynamic hydricity of transition&#8208;metal hydrides is a key parameter to guide in framing new catalyst design concepts for several hydride transfer catalysis including energy&#8208;relevant processes such as H+ and CO2 reduction to H2 and formate, respectively. Important aspects of this emerging research direction are summarized in the Minireview by J. Choudhury et&#8197;al. on page 5842.

         <title>Frontispiece: Covalency in Actinide Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 19, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
This frontispiece illustrates two ways of achieving a higher degree of covalency in actinide compounds, one employs orbital energy degeneracy and the other&#8212;orbital overlap between the 5f and ligand orbitals.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This frontispiece illustrates two ways&lt;/b&gt; of achieving a higher degree of covalency in actinide compounds, one employs orbital energy degeneracy and the other&#8212;orbital overlap between the 5f and ligand orbitals. For more information see the Concept article by V.&#8197;V. Klepov, H.&#8208;C. zur&#8197;Loye et&#8197;al. on &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202004632"&gt;page 5835&lt;/a&gt;.

         <title>Frontispiece: Recent Advances in Enantioselective Desymmetrizations of Prochiral Oxetanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 19, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthetic utility of prochiral oxetanes, based on their inherent ring&#8208;strain and Lewis&#8208;basicity, is highlighted in the Minireview by A. Sandvo&#223; and J.&#8197;M. Wiest on page 5871. Elegant desymmetrization strategies have been established for 3&#8208;substituted, 3,3 as well as 2,2&#8208;disubstituted oxetanes, which give rise to a diversity of products. The enantioselectivity of these reactions can be controlled through sophisticated choice of Lewis acids or Br&#248;nsted acids.

         <title>Cover Feature: Sb6O7(SO4)2: A Promising Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Material with an Enhanced Second&#8208;Harmonic&#8208;Generation Response Activated by SbIII Lone&#8208;Pair Stereoactivity (Chem. Eur. J. 19/2021)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 19, Page 5831-5831, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing the stereoactive lone pair cation of SbIII into sulfates, an anhydrous sulfate of Sb6O7(SO4)2 is achieved. Sb3+ cations are in seesaw configurations and in&#8208;phase aligned in a three&#8208;dimensional asymmetric dense structure. The material exhibits an enhanced phase&#8208;matching second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation response, a moderate birefringence, a wide transparency window and considerable environmental stabilities, which endow it a promising UV nonlinear optical material. Theoretical studies reveal that the functional SbIII with stereochemical active lone pair makes predominant contribution to the enhanced effect. More information can be found in the Communication by X.&#8208;T. An, G.&#8208;M. Wang, et&#8197;al. on page 5880.

         <title>Cover Feature: Synthesis and Characterization of Two Uranyl&#8208;Aryl &#8220;Ate&#8221; Complexes (Chem. Eur. J. 19/2021)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 19, Page 5833-5833, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first structurally&#8208;characterized uranyl aryl complexes are reported in this work. A combined 13C NMR spectroscopic and relativistic DFT computational analysis reveals that the chemical shifts of the aryl ipso carbon nuclei are shifted downfield by 62 to 68&#8197;ppm due to high levels of 5f orbital participation in the U&#8722;C bonds. Significantly, this study showcases the exquisite sensitivity of 13C chemical shifts to 5f participation in An&#8722;C bonding, further cementing the utility of this emerging method of analysis. More information can be found in the Communication by J. Autschbach, T.&#8197;W. Hayton, et&#8197;al. on page 5885.

Open and shut with silver! A silver&#8208;promoted fluorine substitution reaction of &#945;&#8208;bromoamide has been recently developed. This methodology enables access to tertiary, secondary, and primary alkyl fluorides with chemoselectivity and stereospecificity by forming an aziridinone intermediate. The cover image depicts that molecules are closed, and opening like an umbrella. In addition, the reaction of &#945;&#8208;bromoamide with O&#8208;nucleophiles including OCF3 provided the sterically hindered alcohol, ester and ether. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Mizuta et&#8197;al. on page 5930.

Impossible object in the molecular world: a stereogenic figure&#8208;eight molecule, which exhibits remarkable CPL properties, is depicted in the cover image. Electrons confined to the rigid and twisted molecule contribute greatly to the amplification of CPL in the excited state. The widely delocalized electrons in the molecule are described as if they were cats walking across a mysterious impossible object in the world of M.&#8197;C. Escher. More information can be found in the Full Paper by M. Hasegawa, Y. Imai, et&#8197;al. on page 5923.

         <title>Terpyridine&#8208;Based 3D Metal&#8211;Organic&#8208;Frameworks: A Structure&#8211;Property Correlation</title>

Terpyridine&#8208;based MOFs: The main objective of this review is to highlight the design strategy of 3D metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) based on 4&#8242;&#8208;phenyl substituted terpyridine derivatives, their structural features, and the important physicochemical properties related to the structures. The structure&#8211;property correlations could give rise to some concepts for the future design of terpyridine&#8208;based MOFs with desired properties.







Abstract
Design, synthesis, and applications of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are among the most salient fields of research in modern inorganic and materials chemistry. As the structure and physical properties of MOFs are mostly dependent on the organic linkers or ligands, the choice of ligand system is of utmost importance in the design of MOFs. One such crucial organic linker/ligand is terpyridine (tpy), which can adopt various coordination modes to generate an enormous number of metal&#8211;organic frameworks. These frameworks generally carry physicochemical characteristics induced by the &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;rich (basically N&#8208;electron&#8208;rich moiety) terpyridines. In this minireview, the construction of 3D MOFs associated with symmetrical terpyridines is discussed. These ligands can be easily derivatized at the lateral phenyl (4&#8242;&#8208;phenyl) position and incorporate additional organic functionalities. These functionalities lead to some different binding modes and form higher dimensional (3D) frameworks. Therefore, these 3D MOFs can carry multiple features along with the characteristics of terpyridines. Some properties of these MOFs, like photophysical, chemical selectivity, photocatalytic degradation, proton conductivity, and magnetism, etc. have also been discussed and correlated with their frameworks.

         <title>Emerging Implications of the Concept of Hydricity in Energy&#8208;Relevant Catalytic Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 19, Page 5842-5857, April 1, 2021. </description>

Back to the drawing board: Thermodynamic hydricity serves as an important conceptual tool in developing key catalyst design principles for various hydride&#8208;transfer reactions. Controlling factors such as solvent, metal identity, and ligand structure play a significant role in manipulating the thermodynamic hydricity of transition&#8208;metal complexes. These important aspects are discussed in the context of optimizing energy&#8208;relevant processes, such as H+ and CO2 reduction to H2 and formate, respectively.







Abstract
The &#8220;hydricity&#8221; of a species refers to its hydride&#8208;donor ability. Similar to how the pKa is useful for determining the extent of dissociation of an acid, the hydricity plays a vital role in understanding hydride&#8208;transfer reactions. A large number of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed processes involve the hydride&#8208;transfer reaction as a key step. Among these, two key reactions&#8212;proton reduction to evolve H2 and hydride transfer to CO2 to generate formate/formic acid&#8212;represent a promising solution to build a sustainable and fossil&#8208;fuel&#8208;free energy economy. Therefore, it is imperative to develop an in&#8208;depth relationship between the hydricity of transition&#8208;metal hydrides and its influencing factors, so that efficient and suitable hydride&#8208;transfer catalysts can be designed. Moreover, such profound knowledge can also help in improving existing catalysts, in terms of their efficiency and working mechanism. With this broad aim in mind, some important research has been explored in this area in recent times. This Minireview emphasizes the conceptual approaches developed thus far, to tune and apply the hydricity parameter of transition&#8208;metal hydrides for efficient H2 evolution and CO2 reduction/hydrogenation catalysis focusing on the guiding principles for future research in this direction.

         <title>Recent Advances in Enantioselective Desymmetrizations of Prochiral Oxetanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 19, Page 5871-5879, April 1, 2021. </description>

Prochiral oxetanes are excellent candidates for the synthesis of chiral alcohols and ethers via enantioselective desymmetrization. Recent methods relying on transition metal, Lewis acid, and Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis allow access to a remarkably diverse set of compounds, which are highlighted and put into context.







Abstract
Strain relief of oxetanes offers a plethora of opportunities for the synthesis of chiral alcohols and ethers. In this context, enantioselective desymmetrization has been identified as a powerful tool to construct molecular complexity and this has led to the development of elegant strategies on the basis of transition metal, Lewis acid, and Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis. This review highlights recent examples that harness the inherent reactivity of prochiral oxetanes and offers an outlook on the immense possibilities for synthetic application.

         <title>Isoselective Polymerization of rac&#8208;Lactide by Aluminum Complexes of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Phosphinidene Adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 19, Page 5913-5918, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene&#8208;phosphinidene trimethylaluminum (AlMe3) complexes can promote the isoselective ring&#8208;opening polymerization of rac&#8208;lactide, which proceeds via insertion into the aluminum&#8208;carbon bonds with the monodentate, prochiral phosphorus ligand acting as a stereo&#8208;directing group.







Abstract
The N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;phosphinidene adducts (NHC)PH were reacted with AlMe3 in toluene to afford the monoaluminum complexes [{(IDipp)PH}AlMe3] and [{(IMes)PH}AlMe3] (IDipp=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene, IMes=1,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene). In contrast, the dialuminum complex [{(MeIMes)PH}(AlMe3)2] was obtained for MeIMes=1,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethylimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene. These complexes served as initiators for the efficient ring&#8208;opening polymerization of rac&#8208;lactide in toluene at 60&#8201;&#176;C. High degrees of isoselectivity were found for the poly(rac&#8208;lactide) obtained in the presence of the monoaluminum complexes (Pm up to 0.92, Tm up to 191&#8201;&#176;C), whereas almost atactic polymers were produced by the dialuminum complex. Detailed mechanistic studies reveal that the polymerization proceeds via a coordination&#8208;insertion mechanism with the carbene&#8208;phosphinidene ligands acting as stereodirecting groups.

&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; up to 191&#8201;&#176;C), whereas almost atactic polymers were produced by the dialuminum complex. Detailed mechanistic studies reveal that the polymerization proceeds via a coordination&#8208;insertion mechanism with the carbene&#8208;phosphinidene ligands acting as stereodirecting groups.&lt;/p&gt;

Domino reactions involving nickel&#8208;catalyzed additions of (hetero)arylboronic acids to alkynes, followed by cyclization of the alkenylnickel intermediates onto tethered acyclic ketones to give chiral tertiary&#8208;alcohol&#8208;containing products in high enantioselectivities, are described. The reversible E/Z isomerization of the alkenylnickel intermediates enables overall anti&#8208;arylmetallative cyclization to occur. The ring system of the products are substructures of certain diarylindolizidine alkaloids.

         <title>Direct Cyclopropanation of &#945;&#8208;Cyano &#946;&#8208;Aryl Alkanes by Light&#8208;Mediated Single Electron Transfer Between Donor&#8211;Acceptor Pairs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 19, Page 5901-5905, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light and a base are all you need to couple &#945;&#8208;acidic cyanoalkanes with C1 units to form cyclopropanes. No photocatalyst, transition metal or alkene is required. Mechanistically, a photoinduced single electron transfer of a transient donor&#8211;acceptor complex is proposed to form a reactive &#946;,&#945;&#8208;radical anion of the cyanoalkane prior to &#946;&#8208;coupling with a decarboxylated C1 radical and &#945;&#8208;anionic ring closure.







Abstract
Cyclopropanes are traditionally prepared by the formal [2+1] addition of carbene or radical based C1 units to alkenes. In contrast, the one&#8208;pot intermolecular cyclopropanation of alkanes by redox active C1 units has remained unrealised. Herein, we achieved this process simply by exposing &#946;&#8208;aryl propionitriles and C1 radical precursors (N&#8208;oxy esters) to base and blue light. The overall process is redox&#8208;neutral and a photocatalyst, whether metal&#8208; or organic&#8208;based, is not required. Our findings support that single electron transfer (SET) from the &#945;&#8208;cyano carbanion of the propionitrile to the N&#8208;oxy ester is facilitated by blue&#8208;light via their electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complex. The &#945;&#8208;cyano carbon radical thus formed can then lose a &#946;&#8208;proton to form a &#960;&#8208;resonance stabilised radical anion that preferentially couples at the benzylic &#946;&#8208;position with a decarboxylated C1 radical unit. This new transition metal&#8208;free chemistry tolerates both electron rich and electron deficient (hetero)aryl systems, even sulfide or alkene functionality, to afford a range of cis&#8208;aryl/cyano cyclopropanes bearing congested tetrasubstituted quaternary carbons.

         <title>Probing the Local Reaction Environment During High Turnover Carbon Dioxide Reduction with Ag&#8208;Based Gas Diffusion Electrodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 19, Page 5906-5912, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Local affection: The abundance of gas diffusion electrodes (GDE) in modern electrochemistry has grown drastically, especially with the increasing interest in electrochemical reduction of CO2. Since several aspects of those electrodes and that reaction are not clarified yet, we herein couple assessment of the local reaction environment to the actual product distribution of the hydrogen evolution/CO2 reduction reaction system at Ag&#8208;based GDEs.







Abstract
Discerning the influence of electrochemical reactions on the electrode microenvironment is an unavoidable topic for electrochemical reactions that involve the production of OH&#8722; and the consumption of water. That is particularly true for the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), which together with the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) exert changes in the local OH&#8722; and H2O activity that in turn can possibly affect activity, stability, and selectivity of the CO2RR. We determine the local OH&#8722; and H2O activity in close proximity to a CO2&#8208;converting Ag&#8208;based gas diffusion electrode (GDE) with product analysis using gas chromatography. A Pt nanosensor is positioned in the vicinity of the working GDE using shear&#8208;force&#8208;based scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) approach curves, which allows monitoring changes invoked by reactions proceeding within an otherwise inaccessible porous GDE by potentiodynamic measurements at the Pt&#8208;tip nanosensor. We show that high turnover HER/CO2RR at a GDE lead to modulations of the alkalinity of the local electrolyte, that resemble a 16&#8201;m KOH solution, variations that are in turn linked to the reaction selectivity.

Half&#8208;sandwich iridium complexes bearing bidentate urea&#8208;phosphorus ligands were found to catalyze the direct reductive amination of aromatic and aliphatic ketones under mild conditions at 0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;% loading with high selectivity towards primary amines.

One of the complexes was found to be active in both the Leuckart&#8211;Wallach (NH4CO2H) type reaction as well as in the hydrogenative (H2/NH4AcO) reductive amination. The protocol with ammonium formate does not require an inert atmosphere, dry solvents, as well as additives and in contrast to previous reports takes place in hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) instead of methanol. Applying NH4CO2D or D2 resulted in a high degree of deuterium incorporation into the primary amine &#945;&#8208;position.

         <title>Sb6O7(SO4)2: A Promising Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Material with an Enhanced Second&#8208;Harmonic&#8208;Generation Response Activated by SbIII Lone&#8208;Pair Stereoactivity</title>

Seesaw structures: An anhydrous sulfate, Sb6O7(SO4)2, featuring considerable environmental stability, is prepared through a solvent&#8208;free method. It exhibits an enhanced phase&#8208;matching second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation (SHG) response and an appropriate birefringence. Functional SbIII, with a stereochemically active lone pair, makes a predominant contribution to the enhanced SHG effect.







Abstract
The stereochemical activity of lone pairs (SCALP) in a cation favors the formation of acentric materials and can enhance the second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation (SHG) response and/or the birefringence. By introducing functional SbIII into sulfates, an anhydrous sulfate of Sb6O7(SO4)2 (1) is explored. Sb3+ cations are in seesaw configurations and in&#8208;phase aligned in a 3D asymmetric dense structure. Compound 1 exhibits an enhanced phase&#8208;matching SHG response, a moderate birefringence, a wide transparency window, and considerable environmental stabilities, which result in it being a promising UV nonlinear optical (NLO) material. Theoretical studies reveal that the stereoactive lone pairs on Sb3+ cations make the predominant contribution to the SHG effect. This work will attract more interest from scientists for research into SCALP&#8208;cation&#8208;based NLO materials.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Two Uranyl&#8208;Aryl &#8220;Ate&#8221; Complexes</title>

5f orbital participation: The first structurally characterized uranyl aryl complexes, [Li(Et2O)2(THF)][UO2(C6Cl5)3] and [Li(THF)4][UO2(C6Cl5)3(THF)], exhibit appreciable covalency in their U&#8722;C bonds, as assayed by a combined 13C&#8197;NMR spectroscopic and DFT computational analysis. Moreover, the former exhibits good thermal stability in arene solvents.







Abstract
Reaction of [UO2Cl2(THF)3] with 3 equivalents of LiC6Cl5 in Et2O resulted in the formation of first uranyl aryl complex [Li(Et2O)2(THF)][UO2(C6Cl5)3] ([Li][1]) in good yields. Subsequent dissolution of [Li][1] in THF resulted in conversion into [Li(THF)4][UO2(C6Cl5)3(THF)] ([Li][2]), also in good yields. DFT calculations reveal that the U&#8722;C bonds in [Li][1] and [Li][2] exhibit appreciable covalency. Additionally, the 13C&#8197;NMR chemical shifts for their Cipso environments are strongly affected by spin&#8208;orbit coupling&#8212;a consequence of 5f orbital participation in the U&#8722;C bonds.

         <title>Selection of Planar Chiral Conformations between Pillar[5,6]arenes Induced by Amino Acid Derivatives in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 19, Page 5890-5896, April 1, 2021. </description>

A side&#8208;chain link to chirality: The &#945;&#8208;side chain or ethyl ester moieties of a chiral &#945;&#8208;amino acid ethyl ester hydrochloride were recognized by detecting induced CD signals of WP5 or its homologue WP6. The forces involved in selecting the chiral conformation, such as C (or N)&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions, hydrogen bonds, and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking were illuminated by DFT calculations.







Abstract
Chiral &#945;&#8208;amino acids play critical roles in the metabolic process in nearly all life forms. So far, chiral recognition of &#945;&#8208;amino acids has mainly focused on the determination of l/d enantiomers. Herein, selection of planar chiral conformations between water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arene WP5 and pillar[6]arene WP6 was observed due to &#945;&#8208;side chain or ethyl ester moieties of l&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid ethyl ester hydrochlorides binding with WP5 and WP6, respectively. Therefore, &#945;&#8208;side chain and ethyl ester moieties of l&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid ethyl ester hydrochlorides were recognized by observing the induced CD signal and its inversion. This is a rare example of being able to detect the chiral region around &#945;&#8208;carbon of a chiral &#945;&#8208;amino acid molecule.

         <title>Reactions of C60 with Pyridazine and Phthalazine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cage&#8208;opened bisfulleroids are one of suitable building blocks for making a large hole on fullerenes. Herein, we focused on the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of C  60  with azines among synthetic methods developed thus far to provide bisfulleroids. To our surprise, the computational study predicted that the reaction proceeds with normal electron demand in contrast to hitherto considered inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand pathway. The benzoannulation to the pyridazine ring, i.e., phthalazine, resulted in the remarkably shortened reaction time due to the better interaction between the HOMO of phthalazine and the LUMO of C  60  as well as stronger 2,3&#8208;diaza&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene character in the phthalazine as confirmed crystallographically. Different from our expectation, the benzobisfulleroid was converted into corresponding orifice&#8208;enlarged derivative via the photooxygenation slightly faster than the fulleroid derived from pyridazine.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Formation, Solution Rearrangements, and Catalytic Behavior of a Polymorphic Ca/K Allyl Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Without solvents present, the often far&#8208;from&#8208;equilibrium environment in a mechanochemically driven synthesis can generate high&#8208;energy, non&#8208;stoichiometric products not observed from the same ratio of reagents used in solution. Ball milling 2 equiv. K[A&#180;] (A&#180; = [1,3&#8208;(SiMe3)2C3  H3]&#8211;  ) with CaI2  &#160;yields a non&#8208;stoichiometric calciate, K[CaA&#180;3], which initially forms a structure (1) likely containing a mixture of pi&#8208; and sigma&#8208;bound allyl ligands. Dissolved in arenes, the compound rearranges over the course of several days to a structure (2) with only&#160; &#951;3&#8208;bound allyl ligands, and that can be crystallized as a coordination polymer. If dissolved in alkanes, however, the rearrangement of&#160;1&#160;to&#160;2&#160;occurs within minutes. The structures of&#160;1&#160;and&#160;2&#160;have been modeled with DFT calculations, and&#160;2&#160;initiates the anionic polymerization of methyl methacrylate and isoprene; for the latter, under the mildest conditions yet reported for a heavy Group 2 species (one&#8208;atm pressure and room temperature).</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Positive Materials for Magnesium Batteries: A review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Magnesium batteries, like lithium&#8208;ion batteries, with higher abundance and similar efficiency, have drawn great interest to large&#8208;scale applications such as electric vehicles, grid energy storage etc. On the other hand, the use of organic electrode materials allows high energy&#8208;performance, metal&#8208;free, environmentally friendly, versatile, lightweight, and economic&#8208;efficient magnesium storage devices. In particular, the structural diversity and the simple activity of organic molecules make redox properties and hence battery efficiency easy to monitor. While organic magnesium batteries still in their infancy, this field become more and more promising because significant results were reported in this field. To summarize the achievements in studies on organic cathodes for magnesium systems, we discuss the molecular development, and the combination with electrode design provides the basis for controlling the electrochemical properties. Moreover, the techniques to synthesize organic materials with high&#8208;yield are mentioned. Finally, potential problems and prospects are explored to further improve organic cathodes.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#946; &#8208;lactams, the cornerstone of antibiotherapy, inhibit multiple and partially redundant targets referred to as transpeptidases or penicillin&#8208;binding proteins. These enzymes catalyze the essential cross&#8208;linking step of the polymerization of cell wall peptidoglycan. The understanding of the mechanisms of action of &#946; &#8208;lactams and of resistance to these drugs requires the development of reliable methods to characterize their targets. Here, we describe an activity&#8208;based purification method of &#946; &#8208;lactam targets based on click and release chemistry. We synthesized alkyne&#8208;carbapenems with suitable properties with respect to the kinetics of acylation of a model target, the Ldt fm L , D &#8208;transpeptidase, the stability of the resulting acylenzyme, and the reactivity of the alkyne for the cycloaddition of an azido probe containing a biotin moiety for affinity purification and a bioorthogonal cleavable linker. The probe provided access to the fluorescent target in a single click and release step.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Construction of a N, F&#8208;co Doped Mesoporous Cobalt Phosphate with Rich&#8208;oxygen Vacancies for Oxygen Evolution Reaction and Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal phosphates  have been widely applied as promising candidates  for electrochemical energy storage and conversion fields. In this study, we report a simple method to prepare a N, F&#8208;co doped mesoporous cobalt phosphate with rich&#8208;oxygen vacancies via in&#8208;situ pyrolysis of a Co&#8208;phosphate precursor with NH  4  +  cations and F  &#8208;  anions. Due to this heteroatom doping, it could achieve current density of 10 mA/cm  2  at lower overpotential of 276 mV and smaller Tafel slope of 57.11 mV dec  &#8722;1  on glassy carbon, besides, it has excellent stability and durability current density with 92% of initial current density for 35 hrs. Furthermore, the optimal material applied in supercapacitor displays specific capacitance of 206.3 F g  &#8208;1  at 1 A&#183;g  &#8211;1  and maintains cycling stability with 80% after 3000 cycles. The excellent electrochemical properties should be attributed to N, F&#8208;co doping into this Co&#8208;based phosphate effectively modulates its electronic structure; in addition, its amorphous structure provides more active sites; moreover, its mesoporous structure should be beneficial to the mass transfer and electrolyte diffusion.</dc:description>

         <title>The Efficient K ion Storage of M2P2O7/C (M=Fe, Co, Ni) Anode Derived from Organic&#8208;Inorganic Phosphate Precursors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal phosphates have been widely explored in lithium ion batteries and sodium ion batteries owing to high theoretical capacities, mild toxicity and low cost. However, their potassium ion battery applications are less reported since the limited conductivity and the slow diffusion kinetic hindered. Considering these drawbacks, novel structured M  2  P  2  O  7  /C (M=Fe, Co, Ni) nanoflake composites are prepared via an organic&#8208;phosphors precursor assisted solvothermal method and a post high temperature annealing process. The designed Co  2  P  2  O  7  /C composite exhibits the highest rate capacity with 502 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 0.1 A g  &#8208;1  and good cyclability for 900 cycles at 1 A g  &#8208;1  and 2 A g  &#8208;1  when compared with Ni and Fe based composite. The superior electrochemical performance can be attributed to their unique nanoparticles assembled nanoflake structure, which can afford enough active sites for K  +  intercalation. In addition, the robust pyrophosphate crystal structure and the  in situ  formed carbon composition also have positive effects on enhancing the long&#8208;term cycling performance and the electrode&#8217;s conductivity. Finally, this organic&#8208;phosphors precursor induced simple approach can be applied for easy fabrication of other pyrophosphate/carbon hybrids as advanced electrodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequential Tether&#8208;Directed Synthesis of New [3:2:1] Hexakis&#8208;Adducts of C60 with a Mixed Octahedral Addition Pattern</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new concept for the regioselective synthesis of [3:2:1] hexakis&#8208;adducts of fullerene C  60  was developed. Based on sequential tether&#8208;directed remote functionalizations, chiral [3:2] pentakis&#8208;adducts with an incomplete octahedral addition pattern were synthesized  via  stepwise cyclopropanation of C  60  with suitable macrocyclic tri&#8208; and bifunctional cyclomalonate tethers. The four resulting stereoisomers were isolated using chiral HPLC. The corresponding pairs of enantiomers show mirror image behavior in their CD&#8208;spectra. The pentakis&#8208;adducts served as suitable building blocks for the spatially controlled synthesis of mixed hexakis&#8208;adducts. Implementation of functional group&#8208;bearing monomalonates afforded octahedral [3:2:1] hexakis&#8208;adducts suitable for the construction of larger molecular and supramolecular fullerene architectures in excellent yield.</dc:description>

Implementation of functional group&#8208;bearing monomalonates afforded octahedral [3:2:1] hexakis&#8208;adducts suitable for the construction of larger molecular and supramolecular fullerene architectures in excellent yield.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanoredox Chemistry as an Emerging Strategy in Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent research endeavors have established that the mechanochemical activation of piezoelectric materials can open new avenues in redox chemistry. Impact forces, such as those imparted by a ball mill, have been shown to transform piezoelectric materials such as barium titanate (BaTiO  3  ) into a highly polarized state, which can then donate an electron to a suitable oxidant and receive an electron from a suitable reductant, mimicking established photoredox catalytic cycles. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept studies have elucidated that mechanoredox chemistry holds great potential in sustainable and efficient radical&#8208;based synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Glycerol as a Substrate and Inactivator of Coenzyme B12&#8208;Dependent Diol Dehydratase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diol dehydratase dependent on coenzyme B  12  (B  12  &#8208;dDDH) displays a peculiar feature of being inactivated by its native substrate glycerol (GOL). Surprisingly, the isofunctional enzyme B  12  independent glycerol dehydratase (B  12  &#8208;iGDH) does not undergo suicide inactivation by GOL. Herein we present a series of QM/MM and MD calculations aimed at understanding the mechanism of substrate&#8208;induced suicide inactivation in B  12  &#8208;dDDH and resistance of B  12  &#8208;iGDH to inactivation. We show that the first step in the enzymatic transformation of GOL, hydrogen abstraction, can occur from both ends of the substrate (either C1 or C3 of glycerol). Whereas C1 abstraction in both enzymes leads to product formation, C3 abstraction in B  12  &#8208;dDDH results in the formation of a low energy radical intermediate, which is effectively trapped within a deep well on the potential energy surface. The long lifetime of this radical intermediate likely enables its side reactions, leading to inactivation.&#160; In B  12  &#8208;iGDH C3 abstraction appears to be endothermic, consequently radical intermediate is not of low energy, and the reverse process of reforming the reactant is possible.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>

Stability of transition metals in nanostructured platinum alloys is however a fundamental and practical problem in electrocatalysis, due to leaching of transition metals under acidic operating condition. Herein, an ultimate corrosion method has been developed to a Pt&#8208;Cu electrocatalyst with high activity (6.6 folds of commercial Pt/C) and excellent stability for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) under acidic operating conditions.

         <title>Polythiolactone&#8208;Decorated Silica Particles &#8211; a Versatile Approach for Surface Functionalization, Catalysis and Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The surface chemistry of colloidal silica has tremendous effects on its properties and applications. Commonly the design of silica particles is based on the de novo synthesis followed by the surface functionalization leading to tailormade properties for a specific purpose. Here, we demonstrate the design of robust &#8220;precursor&#8221; polymer&#8208;decorated silica nano&#8208; and microparticles which allows for easy post&#8208;modification by polymer embedded thiolactone chemistry. To obtain this organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid material, we functionalized silica particles (SiO2P) via surface&#8208;initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI&#8208;ATRP) with poly(2&#8208;hydroxyyethyl acrylate) (PHEA)&#8208;poly(thiolactone acrylamide (PThlAm) co&#8208;polymer brushes. Exploiting the versatility of thiolactone post&#8208;modification, we developed a system that could be used in three exemplary applications: (I) the straightforward molecular post&#8208;functionalization to tune the surface polarity and therefore the dispersibility in various solvents. (II) the immobilization of metal nanoparticles into the polymer brushes via the in situ formation of free thiols that preserved catalytic activity in a model reaction. (III) the formation of redox&#8208;responsive, permeable polymer capsules by crosslinking the thiolactone moieties with cystamine dihydrochloride (CDH) followed by dissolving the silica core.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks toward Diverse Photocatalytic Aerobic Oxidations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoactive  two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks  (2D&#8208;COFs) have become promising heterogenous photocatalysts in visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven organic transformations recently. Herein, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven selective aerobic oxidation of various small organic molecules by using 2D&#8208;COFs as the photocatalyst was developed. In this protocol, due to the remarkable photocatalytic capability of  hydrazone&#8208;based 2D&#8208;COF&#8208;1  on molecular oxygen activation, a wide range of amides, quinolones, heterocyclic compounds, and sulfoxides were delivered with high efficiency and excellent functional group tolerance under very mild reaction conditions. Furthermore,  benefiting from the inherent advantage of heterogenous photocatalysis  , prominent sustainability and easy photocatalyst recyclability, a drug molecule (modafinil) and an oxidized mustard gas simulant (2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfoxide) were selectively and easily obtained in scale&#8208;up reactions. Mechanistic investigations have been conducted using radical quenching experiments and  in situ  ESR spectroscopy, all  corroborating  the proposed role of 2D&#8208;COF&#8208;1 in photocatalytic cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Cerium Doping Double Perovskite Scintillator for Sensitive X&#8208;ray Detection and Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Scintillators are widely used for nondestructive testing, nuclear medicine image, space exploration and security inspection in the fields of radiation detectors. Recently, lead halide perovskite scintillation crystals have been brought into focus due to their high effective atomic number, fast scintillation decay time, strong luminous efficiency and tunable band gap. However, their application is limited by lead toxicity. Here we report that the Ce&#8208;doped to increase sensitivity in lead&#8208;free double perovskite crystals (Cs  2  NaTbCl  6  ) for X&#8208;ray detection and imaging. The introduction of Ce ion can be used as sensitizer to improve the radioluminescence of the crystals. The light output of Ce:Cs  2  NaTbCl  6  crystals is about 52153 ph/MeV, which is 25% higher than that of un&#8208;doped crystal. The X&#8208;ray sensitivity is significantly enhanced. And based on our scintillation film X&#8208;ray detector with a detection limit of 30 nGy&#183;s  &#8208;1  , which is about 1/183 of the typical medical imaging dose. Ours scintillating film has an excellent ability of imaging with spatial resolution of up to 10 lp/mm. The research shows that Ce:Cs  2  NaTbCl  6  perovskite crystals scintillators as promising materials for X&#8208;ray imaging application.</dc:description>

         <title>Theoretical Simulations of Thermochromic and Aggregation&#8208;induced Emission Behaviors of a Series of Red&#8208;light Anthracene&#8208;o&#8208;carborane Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantum mechanics and molecular dynamics simulations were carried out on a series of anthracene&#8208;  o  &#8208;carborane derivatives (  ANT&#8208;H  ,  ANT&#8208;Ph  ,  ANT&#8208;Me  and  ANT&#8208;TMS  ) with rare red&#8208;light emission in solid state. The simulation on the heating process of the crystals and further comparison of the molecular structures and excited&#8208;state properties before and after heating help us to disclose the thermochromic behavior, i.e., the red&#8208;shift emission is caused by the elongation of the C1&#8208;C2 bond in the carborane moiety after heating. Thus we believe that the molecular structure in crystal is severely affected by the heating. Molecular conformation transformation appears in  ANT&#8208;H  crystal with the increase of temperature. More specifically, the anthracene moiety changes from nearly parallel to the C1&#8208;C2 bond to nearly perpendicular, leading to the disappearance of the short&#8208;wavelength emission after heating. As for the aggregation&#8208;induced emission phenomenon, the structures and photophysical properties were comparatively investigated in both isolated state and crystal state, which suggests that the energy dissipation in crystal surroundings was greatly reduced through hindering structure relaxation from excited state to ground state. We expect that the discussion of the thermochromic behavior provides a new analysis perspective for the molecular design of  o  &#8208;carborane derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioconvergent Substitution Reactions of Racemic Electrophiles by Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over the past decades, the development of enantioselective catalysis using organocatalysts has evolved into an active research field and a number of enantioselective transformations have been established. However, despite their being a highly desirable process for the synthesis of organic molecules in an enantioenriched form, the enantioconvergent substitution reactions of racemic electrophiles using organocatalysts still present several challenges. Although intrinsic difficulties in the catalytic stereocontrol abound due to the initial chiral information of racemic electrophiles, in recent years, mechanistically diverse enantioconvergent processes have been intensively investigated in organocatalysis. In this minireview, we focus on recent achievements in the development of enantioconvergent substitution reactions of racemic electrophiles using organocatalysts. The contents are classified on the basis of the mechanistic types of enantioconvergent processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;catalyzed Low Pressure Carbonylation of Allylic Alcohols by Catalytic Anhydride Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A direct carbonylation of allylic alco&#173;hols has been realized for the first time with high catalyst activity at low pressure of CO (10 bar). The pro&#173;ce&#173;dure is described in detail for the car&#173;bo&#173;nylation of  E  &#8208;nero&#173;lidol, an important step in a new BASF&#8208;route to (&#8208;)&#8208;ambrox. Key to high activities in the allylic alcohol car&#173;bo&#173;nylation is the finding that catalytic amounts of carboxylic acid an&#173;hydride activate the substrate and are constantly re&#173;gen&#173;er&#173;ated with carbon monoxide under the reaction conditions. The identified reaction conditions are trans&#173;&#173;ferrable to other substrates as well.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic and Kinetic Factors of ortho&#8208;Benzyne Formation in Hexadehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder (HDDA) Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the rapid development of the hexadehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction (HDDA) from its first discovery in 1997, the question of whether a concerted or stepwise mechanism better describes the thermally activated formation of  ortho  &#8208;benzyne from a diyne and a diynophile has been debated. Mechanistic and kinetic investigations were able to show that this is not a black or white situation, as minor changes can tip the balance. For that reason, especially, linked yne&#8208;diynes were studied to examine steric, electronic, and radical&#8208;stabilizing effects of their terminal substituents on the reaction mechanism and kinetics. Furthermore, the influence of the nature of the linker on the HDDA reaction was explored. The more recently discovered photochemical HDDA reaction also gives  ortho  &#8208;arynes, which display the same reactivity as the thermally generated ones, but their formation might not proceed by the same mechanism. This minireview summarizes the current state of mechanistic understanding of the HDDA reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Synthesis of Large Single Crystals of Metal&#8208;Organic Framework CPO&#8208;27&#8208;Ni Prepared by a Modulation Approach: In situ Single Crystal X&#8208;ray Diffraction Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The size of single crystals of the metal&#8208;organic framework CPO&#8208;27&#8208;Ni was incrementally increased through a series of modulated syntheses. A novel linker modulated synthesis using 2,5&#8208;dihydroxyterephthalic acid and the isomeric ligand 4,6&#8208;dihydroxyisophthalic acid yielded large single crystals of CPO&#8208;27&#8208;Ni (~70 &#181;m). All materials proved high crystallinity and phase pure through powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, electron microscopy methods, thermogravimetric, and compositional analysis. For the first time single crystal structure analyses were carried out on CPO&#8208;27&#8208;Ni. High BET surface areas and nitric oxide (NO) release efficiencies were recorded for all materials. Large single crystals of CPO&#8208;27&#8208;Ni showed a prolonged NO release and proved suitable for in situ single crystal diffraction experiments to follow the NO adsorption. An efficient activation protocol was developed, leading to a dehydrated structure after just 4 h, which subsequently was NO&#8208;loaded, leading to a first NO loaded single crystal structural model of CPO&#8208;27&#8208;Ni.</dc:description>

         <title>Preparation and Properties of Benzylsulfonyl&#8208;Containing Silicone Copolymers via Ring&#8208;opening Copolymerization of Macroheterocyclosiloxane and Cyclosiloxane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ring&#8208;opening copolymerization (ROCP) of benzylsulfonyl macroheterocyclosiloxane (BSM) and five different cyclosiloxanes was systematically investigated. A general approach for the synthesis of benzylsulfonyl&#8208;containing silicone copolymers with various substituents, including methyl, vinyl, ethyl, and phenyl, was developed herein. A series of copolymers with variable incorporation (from 6% to 82%) of BSM were obtained by modifying the comonomer feed ratio and using KOH as the catalyst in a mixed solvent of dimethylformamide and toluene. The obtained copolymers exhibited various composition&#8208;dependent properties and unique viscoelasticity. Notably, the surface and fluorescent characteristics as well as the glass transition temperatures of the copolymers could be tailored by varying the amount of BSM. Unlike typical sulfone&#8208;containing polymers, such as poly(olefin sulfone)s, the prepared copolymers displayed excellent thermal and hydrolytic stability. The universal strategy developed in the present study provides a platform for the design of innovative silicone copolymers with adjustable structures and performance.</dc:description>

         <title>A Protecting&#8208;Group&#8208;Free Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Salvinorin A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A concise enantioselective total synthesis of the neoclerodane diterpene (&#8722;)&#8208;salvinorin A is reported. The stereogenic center at C&#8208;12 was installed by catalytic asymmetric propargylation with excellent enantioselectivity, and the remaining six stereogenic centers were set up highly diastereoselectively under substrate control. As for our previous synthesis of racemic salvinorin A, two intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reactions were applied to generate the tricyclic core. A chemoselective Mitsunobu inversion of a  syn  1,2&#8208;diol allowed for further streamlining of the original reaction sequence by two steps. Overall, (&#8722;)&#8208;salvinorin A was synthesized in only 16 steps starting from 3&#8208;furaldehyde with 1.4% total yield. Furthermore, an alternative intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder strategy employing a 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene moiety was investigated.</dc:description>

         <title>Sustainable and robust graphene cellulose paper decorated with lithiophilic Au nanoparticles to enable dendrite&#8208;free and high&#8208;power lithium metal anode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium metal anodes (LMAs) with high energy density have recently captured increasing attentions for development of next&#8208;generation batteries. However, practical viability of LMAs is hindered by the uncontrolled Li dendrite growth and infinite dimension change. Even though constructing 3D conductive skeleton has been regarded as a reliable strategy to prepare low volume stress LMAs, engineering the renewable and lithiophilic conductive scaffold is still a challenge. Herein, a robust scaffold derived from renewable cellulose paper, which is coated by reduced graphene oxide and decorated with lithiophilic Au nanoparticles, is engineered for LMAs. The graphene cellulose fibres with high surface area can reduce the local current density, while the well&#8208;dispersed Au nanoparticles can serve as lithiophilic nanoseeds to lower the nucleation overpotential of&#160;plating. The coupled relationship can guarantee uniform Li nucleation and unique Li spherical growth into 3D carbon matrix. Moreover, the natural cellulose paper possesses outstanding mechanical strength to tolerate the volume stress. In virtue of the modulated deposition behaviour and near&#8208;zero volume change, the hybrid LMAs can achieve reversible Li plating/stripping at ultrahigh current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2 as evidenced by high Coulombic efficiency (97.2% after 60 cycles) and ultralong lifespan (1000 cycles) together with ultralow overpotential (25 mV). Therefore, this strategy sheds light on a scalable approach to multiscale design versatile Li host, promising highly stable Li metal battery to be feasible and practical.</dc:description>

         <title>Easy Access to Versatile Catalytic Systems for C&#8208;H Activation and Reductive Amination Based on Tetrahydrofluorenyl Rhodium(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>On the basis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydrofluorenyl ligand, a simple approach was developed to new effective rhodium catalysts for the construction of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bonds. The halide compounds [(&#951;5&#8208;tetrahydrofluorenyl)RhX2]2 (2a: X = Br; 2b: X = I) were synthesized by treatment of the bis(ethylene) derivative (&#951;5&#8208;tetrahydrofluorenyl)Rh(C2H4)2 (1a) with halogens. An analogous reaction of the cyclooctadiene complex (&#951;5&#8208;tetrahydrofluorenyl)Rh(cod) (1b) with I2 is complicated by the side formation of [(cod)RhI]2. The reaction of 2b with 2,2&#697;&#8208;bipyridyl leads to cation [(&#951;5&#8208;tetrahydrofluorenyl)Rh(2,2&#697;&#8208;bipyridyl)I]+ (3). The halide abstraction from 2a,b with thallium or silver salts allowed us to prepare sandwich compounds with incoming cyclopentadienyl, dicarbollide and mesitylene ligands [(&#951;5&#8208;tetrahydrofluorenyl)RhCp]+ (4), (&#951;5&#8208;tetrahydrofluorenyl)Rh(&#951;&#8208;7,8&#8208;C2B9H11) (5), and [(&#951;5&#8208;tetrahydrofluorenyl)Rh(&#951;&#8208;mesitylene)]2+ (6). The structures of 1b, 2b&#8729;2I2, 3PF6, 4TlI4, 5, and [(cod)RhI]2 were determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Compounds 2a,b efficiently catalyze the oxidative coupling of benzoic acids with alkynes to selectively give isocoumarins or naphthalenes, depending on the reaction temperature. Moreover, they showed moderate catalytic activity in other annulations of alkynes with aromatic compounds (such as benzamide, acetanilide, etc.) which proceed through CH activation. Compound 2b also effectively catalyzes the reductive amination of aldehydes and ketones in the presence of carbon monoxide and water via water&#8208;gas shift reaction, giving amines in high yields (67&#8722;99%).</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Hidden &#963;&#8208;Dimerization of a Kinetically Protected Olympicenyl Radical</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The &#963;&#8208;dimer of a kinetically protected olympicenyl radical, which evaded the experimental detection, was revealed by converting into biolympicenylidene with  E  &#8208;configuration in a regioselective manner. The complicated stereochemistry and energetics of the &#963;&#8208;dimers derived from  C  2  v  symmetry and uneven spin distribution of the olympicenyl radical were revealed by the theoretical calculations, and the energetic preference of &#960;&#8208;dimer over &#963;&#8208;dimer by a minute gap was disclosed. The  E&#8208;  biolympicenylidene, a polycyclic ene structure previously considered as reactive intermediate in the phenalenyl radical system, exhibited exceptional stability, which allowed for a detailed investigation on its singlet diradical character and physical properties by means of X&#8208;ray crystallography, UV&#8208;  vis  &#8208;NIR absorption/emission spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry, and assisted by theoretical calculations. The  E&#8208;  biolympicenylidene showed high resistance towards both thermal and photochemical ring&#8208;cyclization reactions, which was attributed to high activation energies for the rate&#8208;determining electrocyclization operated on both disrotatory and conrotatory mode, as well as a small spin density at the bonding sites for the radical&#8208;radical coupling process.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclopentadienone Derivative Dimers as Tunable Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of photoswitchable cyclopentadienone derivative dimers bearing bromo, thienyl, 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)phenyl, 3&#8208;pyridinyl, 4&#8208;nitrophenyl and cyano groups was designed and facilely synthesized. Their photoswitching properties such as the photoconversions in the photostationary state (PSS), the thermal kinetics and thermal half&#8208;lives of photoisomers were systematically investigated. These photoswitches show high fatigue resistance and large photoconversions in the PSS. This work proves that the photoswitching properties of photoswitches based on cyclopentadienone dimers can be tuned by substitution groups and also pave the way to functionalize the cyclopentadienone derivative dimer&#8208;based photoswitch, which is important for its future applications.</dc:description>

         <title>d/f&#8208;Polypnictides Derived by Non&#8208;Classical Ln2+ Compounds: Synthesis, Small Molecule Activation and Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reduction chemistry induced by divalent lanthanides is primarily focused on samarium so far. In light of the rich physical properties of the lanthanides, this limitation to one element is a drawback. Since molecular divalent compounds of almost all lanthanides are available for some time, we used a known and two new non&#8208;classical reducing agents of the early lanthanides to establish a sophisticated reduction chemistry. As a result, six new d/f&#8208;polyphosphides or d/f&#8208;polyarsenides, [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)] [Cp''  2  Ln(E  5  )FeCp*] (Ln = La, Ce, Nd; E = P, As) were obtained. Their reactivity was studied by activation of P  4  , resulting in a selective expansion of the P  5  rings. The obtained compounds [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)] [Cp''  2  Ln(P  7  )FeCp*] (Ln = La, Nd) are the first examples of an activation of P  4  by a f&#8208;element&#8208;polypnictide complex. Additionally, the first systematic femto&#8208;second (fs)&#8208;spectroscopy investigations of d/f&#8208;polypnictides are presented to showcase the advantages of having access to a broader series of lanthanide compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Na2FePO4F/biocarbon nanocomposite hollow microspheres derived from biological cell template as high&#8208;performance cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>we successfully synthesized Na  2  FePO  4  F/biocarbon nanocomposite hollow microspheres from Fe  III  precursor as cathodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries through self&#8208;assembly of yeast cell biotemplate and sol&#8211;gel technology. The carbon coating on nanoparticle surface with a mesoporous structure enhances electron diffusion into Na  2  FePO  4  F crystal particles. The improved electrochemical performance of Na  2  FePO  4  F/biocarbon nanocomposites is attributed to the larger electrode&#8211;electrolyte contact area and more active sites for Na  +  on the surface of hollow microspheres compared with those of Na  2  FePO  4  F/C. The Na  2  FePO  4  F/biocarbon nanocomposite exhibits a high initial discharge capacity of 114.3 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 0.1 C, long&#8208;cycle stability with a capacity retention of 74.3% after 500 cycles at 5 C, and excellent rate capability (70.2 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 5 C) compared with Na  2  FePO  4  F/C. This novel nanocomposite hollow microsphere structure is suitable for improving the property of other cathode materials for high&#8208;power batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Activated Self&#8208;Resolution and Error&#8208;Correction in Catalytic Reaction Networks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To understand the emergence of function in complex reaction networks is a primary goal of systems chemistry and origin&#8208;of&#8208;life studies. Especially challenging is the establishment of systems that simultaneously exhibit several functionality parameters that can be independently tuned. In this work, a multifunctional complex reaction network of nucleophilic small molecule catalysts for the Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (MBH) reaction is demonstrated. The dynamic system exhibited triggered self&#8208;resolution, preferentially amplifying a specific catalyst/product set out of a many potential alternatives. By utilizing selective reversibility of the products of the reaction set, systemic thermodynamically driven error&#8208;correction could also be introduced. To achieve this, a dynamic covalent MBH reaction based on adducts with internal H&#8208;transfer capabilities was developed, displaying rate accelerations of retro&#8208;MBH reactions up to 10  4  times. This study demonstrates how efficient self&#8208;sorting of catalytic systems can be achieved through an interplay of several complex emergent functionalities.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultraviolet&#8208;Cured Semi&#8208;Interpenetrating Network Polymer Electrolytes for High&#8208;Performance Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid polymer electrolytes with relatively low ionic conductivity at room temperature and poor mechanical strength greatly restrict their practical applications. Herein, we design semi&#8208;interpenetrating network polymer (SNP) electrolyte composed of an ultraviolet&#8208;crosslinked polymer network (ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate), linear polymer chains (polyvinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) and lithium salt solution to satisfy the demand of high ionic conductivity, good mechanical flexibility and electrochemical stability for lithium metal batteries. The semi&#8208;interpenetrating network has pivotal effect in improving chain relaxation, facilitating the local segmental motion of polymer chains and reducing the polymer crystallinity. Thanks to these advantages, the SNP electrolyte shows a high ionic conductivity (1.12 mS cm&#8722;1  at 30&#176;C), wide electrochemical stability window (4.6 V  vs.  Li+/Li), good bendability and shape versatility. The promoted ion transport combined with suppressed impedance growth during cycling contribute to gratifying cell performances. The assembled quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (LiFePO4/SNP/Li) exhibit good cycling stability and rate capability at room temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Spectroscopic Studies of Synthetic Methylaluminoxane; Structure of Methylaluminoxane Activators</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrolysis of trimethylaluminum (Me  3  Al) in polar solvents can be monitored by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) using the donor additive octamethyltrisiloxane [(Me  3  SiO)  2  SiMe  2  , OMTS]. Using hydrated salts, hydrolytic methylaluminoxane (h&#8208;MAO) features different anion distributions, depending on the conditions of synthesis, and different activator contents as measured by NMR spectroscopy. Non&#8208;hydrolytic MAO was prepared using trimethylboroxine. The properties of this material, which contains incorporated boron, differ significantly from h&#8208;MAO. In the case of MAO prepared by direct hydrolysis, oligomeric anions are observed to rapidly form, and then more slowly evolve into a mixture dominated by an anion with  m/z  1375 with formula [(MeAlO)  16  (Me  3  Al)  6  Me]  &#8722;  . Theoretical calculations predict that sheet structures with composition (MeAlO)  n  (Me  3  Al)  m  are favored over other motifs for MAO in the size range suggested by the ESI&#8208;MS experiments. A possible precursor to the  m/z  1375 anion is a local minimum based on the free energy released upon hydrolysis of Me  3  Al.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Partially Saturated Fluorenyl&#8208;Derived [n]helicenes Featuring an Overcrowded Alkene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The straightforward, multigram&#8208;scale synthesis of the partially saturated H  6  &#8208;fluoreno[  n  ]helicenes (  n  = 5 or 7) featuring a central, overcrowded alkene is described. The key cyclization step was based on an intramolecular McMurry reaction from the corresponding 1,5&#8208;diketones. Chiral stationary phase HPLC analysis and isomer separation indicate that each helicenic compound is constituted of three diastereoisomers at room temperature, i.e. the configurationally&#8208;stable (  R,R,P  ) / (  S,S,M  ) pair of enantiomers and an apparently&#8208;achiral compound resulting from the rapid interconversion between the (  R,S,P  ) and (  S,R,M  ) enantiomers. The partially saturated H  6  &#8208;fluoreno[  n  ]helicenes are oxidatively aromatized to give an efficient access to the corresponding fluoreno[  n  ]helicenes. The chiroptical properties (vibrational and electronic circular dichroism) of the chiral, enantiopure compounds have been measured and analyzed by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, confirming their helicoidal nature.</dc:description>

         <title>Reductive Rearrangement of a 1&#8208;Phospha&#8208;2&#8208;azanorbornene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reduction of the 1&#8208;phospha&#8208;2&#8208;azanorbornene derivate  endo  &#8208;  1  with lithium aluminium hydride leads to an unprecedented 1&#8208;phosphabicyclo[3.2.1]octa&#8208;2,5&#8208;diene, while a phospholide anion is formed with lithium. The latter can be protonated resulting in formation of an unusual 2  H  &#8208;phosphole dimer. Furthermore, 3  H  &#8208;phospholes, previously assumed to have no synthetic relevance as intermediates, were proposed to act as dienophile in the dimerisation of 3,4&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1&#8208;phenylphosphole at elevated temperatures based on theoretical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Induced Growth of Coordination Polymer&#8208;Derived Straight Carbon Nanotubes on Carbon Nanofiber Network for Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low&#8208;cost heteroatom&#8208;doped carbon nanomaterials have been widely studied for efficient oxygen reduction reaction and energy storage and conversion in metal&#8208;air batteries. A Masson pine twigs&#8208;like 3&#8208;dimensional network construction of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) with abundant straight long Co, N, and S&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is developed by thermal treatment of Co&#8208;based polymer coated onto polyacrylonitrile nanofiber network together with thiourea at 900 oC, denoted as CNFT&#8208;Co9S8&#8208;900 . It is interesting to note that the introduction of a high concentration of sulfur does not lead to the complete toxicity of catalysts, but promotes the axial growth to selectively form straight CNTs instead of curly bamboo&#8208;like CNTs. The highly graphitized in&#8208;situ grown Co, N, S&#8208;doped CNTs and the 3&#8208;dimensional N&#8208;doped CNF network provide both active catalytic sites and highly conductive paths, which are beneficial for ORR. Thus, the optimal CNFT&#8208;Co9S8&#8208;900 performs the excellent ORR catalytic activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.84 V and a diffusion&#8208;limited current density of 5.49 mA cm&#8208;2 . Furthermore, the CNFT&#8208;Co9S8&#8208;900 based Zn&#8208;air devices also possess a high power density of 136.9 mW cm&#8208;2 better than commercial Pt/C.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Molecular compounds with permanent tubular architectures displaying radial &#960;&#8208;conjugation are exceedingly rare. Their radial and axial delocalization presents them with unique optical and electronic properties, such as remarkable tuning of their Stokes shifts, and redox switching between global and local aromaticity. Although these tubular compounds display large internal void spaces, these attributes have not been extensively explored presenting future opportunities in the development of materials. By using cutting&#8208;edge synthetic methodologies to bend aromatic surfaces, large opportunities in synthesis, property discovery, and applications are expected in new members of this family of conjugated molecular nanotubes.</dc:description>

         <title>Anthrathiadiazole Derivatives: Synthesis, Physical Properties and Two&#8208;photon Absorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anthrathiadiazole is a key synthon for the construction of large azaacenes, however, the attachment of different substituents onto the skeleton of anthrathiadiazole is difficult but highly desirable because it could be easy to enrich the structures of azaacenes. Here, we demonstrate that anthrathiadiazole derivatives with &#8208;Br, &#8208;CN, and &#8208;OCH 3  groups could be easily constructed through a simple [4+2] cycloaddition reaction between a, a, a&#8217;, a&#8217;&#8208;tetrabromo o&#8208;xylenes derivatives and benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole&#8208;4,7&#8208;dione. The structures of the as&#8208;prepared compounds with different substituents were carefully characterized. Moreover, the basic physical properties of the as&#8208;prepared anthrathiadiazole derivatives were fully investigated, where the cyano&#8208;substituted derivative (BTH&#8208;CN)  has the highest stability and the methoxy&#8208;substituted derivative ( BTH&#8208;OCH 3  )  is easy to be oxidized. Moreover, the two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) characteristics of different anthrathiadiazoles are also studied by using the femtosecond Z&#8208;scan technique. The results show that the fused anthrathiadiazole skeletons possess large TPA cross&#8208;section values &#948; 2  in the range of 3000&#8208;5000 GM, where the nature, position and strength of the substituted groups have strong effect on these values.</dc:description>

         <title>Intersystem Crossing and Electron Spin Selectivity in Anthracene&#8208;Naphthalimide Compact Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Dyads Showing Different Geometry and Electronic Coupling Magnitudes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anthracene&#8208;naphthalimide (An&#8208;NI) compact electron donor&#8208;acceptor dyads were prepared, in which the orientation and distance between the two subunits were varied by direct connection or with intervening phenyl&#160;linker. Efficient intersystem crossing (ISC) and long triplet state lifetime (&#934;  &#916;  = 92%, &#964;  T  = 438 &#956;s) were observed for the directly connected dyads showing a perpendicular geometry (81&#176;). This efficient spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer ISC (SOCT&#8208;ISC) takes 376 fs, inhibits the direct charge recombination (CR) to ground state (  1CT&#8208;&#8208;&gt;S0  , takes 3.04 ns). Interestingly, efficient SOCT&#8208;ISC for dyads with intervening phenyl linker (&#934;&#916;  = 40% in DCM) was also observed, although the electron donor and acceptor adopt almost coplanar geometry (dihedral angle: 15&#176;). Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectroscopy shows that the electron spin polarization of the triplet state,  i.e.  the electron spin selectivity of ISC, is highly dependent on the dihedral angle and the linker. For the dyads showing weaker coupling between the donor and acceptors, the charge separation and the intramolecular triplet energy transfer are inhibited at 80 K (frozen solution), because both the  3  An and  3  NI states were observed and the ESP are same as compared to the native anthracene and naphthalimide, which unravel their origin. The dyads were used as triplet photosensitizers for triplet&#8722;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA UC). High UC quantum yield (&#934;  UC  = 12.9%) as well as a large anti&#8208;Stokes shift (0.72 eV) was attained by excitation into the CT absorption band.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using tritopic and ditopic organic linkers derived from the same 2,4,6&#8208;triphenylpyridine core, copper(II) metal&#8208;organic frameworks with different three&#8208;dimensional structures have been successfully synthesized under ambient conditions. The crystalline framework,  PTB  MOF  ([Cu  3  (PTB)  2  (H  2  O)  3  ]  n  , where H  3  PTB = 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(pyridine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triyl)tribenzoic acid), was observed to be mesoporous in nature and exhibited dual functionalities in the removal of organic dyes. While cationic dyes such as methylene blue and malachite green, which are of different sizes, were adsorbed by  PTB  MOF  ; anionic dyes such as tartrazine could be effectively degraded via a photo&#8208;Fenton&#8208;like reaction catalyzed by the MOFs under the irradiation of visible light.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent advances in the synthesis and applications of chiral gold(III) complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since the beginning of the 2000&#8217;s homogeneous gold catalysis has emerged as a powerful tool to promote the cyclization of unsaturated substrates with excellent regioselectivity allowing for the synthesis of elaborated organic scaffolds. An important goal to achieve in gold catalysis is the possibility to induce enantioselective transformations via the assistance of chiral complexes. Unfortunately, the linear geometry of coordination for gold usually encountered in complexes at the +1 oxidation states renders this goal very challenging. In consequence, the interest toward the synthesis of chiral gold(III) complexes is steadily growing. Indeed, the square planar geometry of the gold(III) cation appears more suitable to promote chiral induction. Beside catalysis, gold(III) complexes have also shown promising potential in the field of pharmacology. In this mini&#8208;review, we aim at summarizing the syntheses and applications of well&#8208;defined gold(III) complexes reported since the last fifteen years.</dc:description>

         <title>Vapochromic Luminescent &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Systems with Reversible Coordination&#8208;Number Control of Hypervalent Tin(IV)&#8208;Fused Azobenzene Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report dynamic and reversible changes of coordination numbers between five and six in solution and solid states based on hypervalent tin(IV)&#8208;fused azobenzene (TAz) complexes. It was found that the  TAz  complexes showed deep&#8208;red emission owing to the hypervalent bond composed of an electron&#8208;donating three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron (3c&#8208;4e) bond and an electron&#8208;accepting nitrogen&#8211;tin (N&#8211;Sn) coordination. Furthermore, hypsochromic shifts in optical spectra were observed in Lewis basic solvents because of alteration of the coordination number from five to six. In particular, vapochromic luminescence was induced by attachment of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) vapor to the coordination point at the tin atom accompanied with a crystal&#8211;crystal phase transition. Additionally, the color&#8208;change mechanism and degree of binding constants were well explained by theoretical calculation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of vapochromic luminescence by using stable and variable coordination numbers of hypervalent bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Quadruple Photoresponsive Functionality in a Crystalline Hybrid Material: Photochromism, Photomodulated Fluorescence, Magnetism and Nonlinear Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As promising photoresponsive materials and potential smart materials, hybrid photochromic materials (HPMs), especially for crystalline HPMs (CHPMs), have been broadly explored for their potentiality in inheriting the merits of each constituents, and intriguing photomodulated functionality. Hitherto, the photoresponsive functionality in explored CHPMs mainly concentrate on dyad combination. By contrast, triple or quadruple photoresponsive properties are very rare because of the limited compatibility of multiple photoresponsive functionality in a single system. In this work, we utilize the electron&#8208;transfer (ET) and crystal engineering strategies to predesign CHPMs with multiple photoresponsive properties via the collaboration of paramagnetic metal ion (Dy3+), electron&#8208;donor (ED) ligand (benzene&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;tricarboxylic acid, H3BTA) and electron&#8208;acceptor (EA) ligand (1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, phen). The resulting complex [Dy(BTA)(phen)2]&#183;2H2O (1) shows hybrid chain with the intrachain Dy3+  ions bridged and chelated by tricarboxylate and phen ligands, respectively. After photostimuli, the ET between tricarboxylate and phen gives birth to photogenerated radicals, resulting in the quadruple photoresponsive properties. Considering the abundant resources of paramagnetic metal ions, ED&#8208; and EA&#8208;ligands, our work provides a general method to construct CHPMs with multiple photoresponsive performances via the collaboration of each unit&#160;under the guidance of ET and crystal engineering strategies.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emitters have attracted significant attention. However, purely organic RTP emitters in red to near&#8208;infrared region have not been properly investigated. In this study, a series of    naphthalenediimide&#8208;   halobenzoate  &#8208;linked molecules are synthesized, one of which exhibits efficient RTP properties, showing red to near&#8208;infrared emission in solid and aqueous dispersion. Spectroscopic studies and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis have shown that the difference in the stacking modes of compounds affects the optical properties, and the formation of intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer complexes of naphthalenediimide&#8208;halobenzoate moiety results in a bathochromic shift of absorption and RTP properties. The time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations showed that the formation of charge&#8208;transfer triplet states and the external heavy atom effect of the halogen atom enhance the intersystem crossing between excited singlet and triplet states.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of manganese valence on specific capacitance in supercapacitors of manganese oxide microspheres</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manganese oxides have attracted great concern in electrochemical energy storage due to high theoretical specific capacitance and abundant valence states. The multiple valence states in the redox reactions are beneficial for enhancing the electrochemical properties. Herein, three manganese microspheres were prepared by a one&#8208;pot hydrothermal method and subsequent calcination at different temperatures using carbon spheres as templates. The trivalent manganese of Mn  2  O  3  exhibited multiple redox transitions of Mn  3+  /Mn  2+  and Mn  4+  /Mn  3+  during the intercalation/deintercalation of electrolyte ions. The possible redox reactions of Mn  2  O  3  were proposed based on the cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammogram results. The Mn  2  O  3  microsphere integrated the advantages of multiple redox couples and unique structure, demonstrating a high specific capacitance and long cycling stability. The symmetric Mn  2  O  3  //Mn  2  O  3  device yielded a maximum energy density of 29.3 Wh kg  &#8208;1  at 250 W kg  &#8208;1  .</dc:description>

The G&#8208;quadruplex stabilization of a library of nine compounds was examined using FRET melting experiments, and CD, UV&#8208;Vis, fluorescence and NMR titrations, identifying several compounds that were capable of stabilizing G&#8208;quadruplex DNA with interesting selectivity profiles. The best G4 ligand was identified as compound  3  , which was based on a perylene scaffold and exhibited 40&#8208;fold selectivity for a telomeric G&#8208;quadruplex over duplex DNA. Surprisingly, a tetra&#8208;substituted flexible core, compound  11  , also exhibited selective stabilization of G4 DNA over duplex DNA. The anticancer and antiparasitic activity of the library was also examined, with the lead compound  3  exhibiting nanomolar inhibition of  T. brucei  with 78&#8208;fold selectivity over MRC5 cells. The cellular localization of this compound was also studied via fluorescence microscopy. We found that uptake time was time dependant, with localization outside the nucleus and kinetoplast that could be due to strong fluorescence quenching in the presence of small amounts of DNA.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Nitrogen Retention of Carbon Anode for Enhancing the Electrochemical Performance for Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Retaining nitrogen for polyacrylonitrile (PAN) based carbon anode is a cost&#8208;effective way to make full use of the advantages of PAN for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Here, a simple strategy is successfully adopted to in situ retain N atoms and increase production yield of a novel composite PAZ by mixing 3 wt% of zinc borate (ZB) with poly (acrylonitrile&#8208;co&#8208;itaconic acid) (PANIA). Among the prepared carbonised fibre (CF) samples, PAZ&#8208;CF&#8208;700 maintains the highest N content, retaining 90% of the original N from PANIA. It represents the highest capacity storage contribution (80.55%) and the lowest impedance Rct (117 &#937;). Consequently, the specific capacity increases from 60 mAh g&#8208;1 of PANIA&#8208;CF&#8208;700 to 190 mAh g&#8208;1 of PAZ&#8208;CF&#8208;700 at a current density of 100 mA g&#8208;1. At the same time, PAZ&#8208;CF&#8208;700 also exhibits a good rate performance and excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability with a specific capacity of 94 mAh g&#8722;1 after 4000 cycles at 1.6 A g&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;Spin and High&#8208;Spin Perferryl Intermediates in Non&#8208;Heme Iron Catalyzed Oxidations of Aliphatic C&#8211;H Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selectivity patterns of iron catalysts of the Fe(PDP) family in aliphatic C&#8211;H oxidation with H  2  O  2  have been studied (PDP =  N  ,  N  &#8242;&#8208;bis(pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyrrolidine). Cyclohexane, adamantane, 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;3,7&#8208;dimethyloctane, 3,7&#8208;dimethyloctyl acetate, (&#8211;)&#8208;acetoxy&#8208;  p  &#8208;menthane, and  cis  &#8208;1,2&#8208;dimethylcyclohexane were used as substrates. The studied catalyst systems generate low&#8208;spin (  S  &#160;=&#160;1/2) oxoiron(V) intermediates or high&#8208;spin (  S  &#160;=&#160;3/2) oxoiron(V) intermediates, depending on the electron&#8208;donating ability of remote substituents at the pyridine rings. The low&#8208;spin perferryl intermediates demonstrate lower stability and higher reactivity toward aliphatic C&#8211;H groups of cyclohexane than their high&#8208;spin congeners, according to the measured self&#8208;decay and second&#8208;order rate constants  k  1  and  k  2  . Unexpectedly, there appears to be no uniform correlation between the spin state of the oxoiron(V) intermediates, and the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity of the corresponding catalyst systems in the oxidation of the considered substrates. This contrasts with the asymmetric epoxidations by the same catalyst systems, in which case the epoxidation enantioselectivity increases when passing from the systems featuring the more reactive low&#8208;spin perferryl intermediates to those with their less reactive high&#8208;spin congeners.</dc:description>

         <title>Intertwined Analytical, Experimental and Theoretical Studies on the formation and structure of a Copper dienolate.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of a silyl dienolate, a Cu(II) salt and TBAT yielding the corresponding copper dienolate is addressed. A combined NMR and cyclic voltammetry analysis first highlight the role of TBAT in the Cu(II) to Cu(I) reduction and the structure of the precatalytic species. From these first results a second set of NMR and theoretical studies enable the determination of the structure and the mechanism of formation of the copper dienolate catalytic species. Finally, we showed that that the copper catalyst promote the  E  /  Z  s&#8208;  cis  / s&#8208;  trans  equilibration of the silyl dienolate precursor through a copper dienolate intermediate. All of these results unveil some peculiarities of the catalytic and asymmetric vinylogous Mukaiyama reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>[10]CPP&#8208;based inclusion complexes of charged fulleropyrrolidines. Effect of the charge location on the photoinduced electron transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A number of non&#8208;covalently bound donor&#8208;acceptor dyads, consisting of C  60  as the electron acceptor and cycloparaphenylene (CPP) as the electron donor, have been reported. A hypsochromic shift of the charge transfer (CT) band in polar medium has been found in  [10]CPP  &#8835;Li  +  @C  60  . To explore this anomalous effect, we study inclusion complexes  [10]CPP  &#8835;Li  +  @C  60  &#8208;MP  ,  [10]CPP  &#8835;C  60  &#8208;MPH  +  , and  [10]CPP  &#8835;C  60  &#8208;PPyMe  +  formed by fulleropyrrolidine derivatives and  [10]CPP  using the DFT/TDDFT approach. We show that the introduction of a positively charged fragment into fullerene stabilizes CT states that become the lowest&#8208;lying excited states. These charge separated states can be generated by the decay of locally excited states on a nanosecond to picosecond time scale. The distance of the charged fragment to the center of the fullerenic cage and its accessibility to the solvent determine the strength of the hypsochromic shift.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Coordination Cages Based on N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Gold(I) Ligands and Their Precursors: Self&#8208;Assembly, Structural Transformation and Guest&#8208;Binding Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of functional groups into the cavity of discrete supramolecular coordination cages (SCCs) will bring unique functions and applications. Here, three dicarboxylate ligands (H  2  L1  Cl, H  2  L2  Cl and H  2  L3  Cl) containing N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) precursors as linkers were introduced to construct SCCs by combining with two  C  3  &#8208;symmertic (CpZr)  3  (  &#956;  3  &#8208;O)(  &#956;  2  &#8208;OH)  3  clusters as three&#8208;connect vertices, resulted in a series of rugby&#8208;like V  2  E  3  (V = vertex, E = edge) type homoleptic cages (  SCC&#8208;1  ,  SCC&#8208;2  and  SCC&#8208;3  ). However, V  4  E  6  &#8208;type tetrahedral cages (  SCC&#8208;4  and  SCC&#8208;5  ), incorporating six Au&#8208;NHC moieties, were obtained when the corresponding NHC&#8208;gold(I) functionalized ligands (H  2  L1  Au  , H  2  L2  Au  ) were applied. For the first time, we present a trackable CpZr&#8208;involved cage to cage conversion to generate a heteroleptic V  2  E  3  cage (  SCC&#8208;6  ) from two homoleptic cages (  SCC&#8208;2  and  SCC&#8208;5  ) with different geometries of V  2  E  3  and V  4  E  6  . The heteroleptic assembly  SCC&#8208;6  can also be formed upon a subcomponent displacement strategy. The structural transformation and reassembly processes were detected and monitored by  1  H NMR spectroscopy and electrospray&#8208;ionization mass spectrometry. The formation of heteroleptic assembly was further supported by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Moreover, homoleptic cage  SCC&#8208;2  possesses a trigonal bipyramidal cationic cavity allowing the encapsulation of a series of sulfonate anionic guests.</dc:description>

Moreover, homoleptic cage  SCC&#8208;2  possesses a trigonal bipyramidal cationic cavity allowing the encapsulation of a series of sulfonate anionic guests.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cationic Aluminium Complexes as Catalysts for Imine Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract  Strongly Lewis acidic cationic aluminium complexes, stabilized by &#946;&#8211;diketiminate (BDI) ligands and free of Lewis bases, have been prepared as their B(C6F5  )4&#713; salts and were investigated for catalytic activity in imine hydrogenation. The backbone (R1) and N (R2) substituents on the  R1,R2  BDI ligand (R1,R2  BDI = HC[C(R1)N(R2)]2) influence sterics and Lewis acidity. Ligand bulk increases along the row  Me,DIPPBDI &lt;  Me,DIPePBDI &#8776;  tBu,DIPPBDI &lt;  tBu,DIPeP  BDI; DIPP = 2,6&#8208;C(H)Me2&#8208;phenyl, DIPeP = 2,6&#8208;C(H)Et2&#8208;phenyl. The Gutmann&#8208;Beckett test showed acceptor numbers of: (tBu,DIPPBDI)AlMe+  85.6, (tBu,DIPePBDI)AlMe+  85.9, (  Me,DIPPBDI)AlMe+  89.7, (Me,DIPePBDI)AlMe+  90.8, (Me,DIPPBDI)AlH+  95.3. Steric and electronic factors need to be balanced for catalytic activity in imine hydrogenation. Open, highly Lewis acidic, cations strongly coordinate imine rendering it inactive as a Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP). The bulkiest cations do not coordinate imine but its combination is also not an active catalyst. The cation (tBu,DIPPBDI)AlMe+  shows the best catalytic activity for various imines and is also an active catalyst for the Tishchenko reaction of benzaldehyde to benzylbenzoate. DFT calculations on the mechanism of imine hydrogenation catalyzed by cationic Al complexes reveal two interconnected catalytic cycles operating in concert. Hydrogen is activated either by FLP reactivity of an Al&#183;&#183;&#183;imine couple or, after formation of significant quantities of amine, by reaction with an Al&#183;&#183;&#183;amine couple. The latter autocatalytic Al&#183;&#183;&#183;amine cycle is energetically favored.</dc:description>

         <title>The Mechanism of Cleavage of RNA Phosphodiesters by a Gold Nanoparticle Nanozyme</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cleavage of uridine 3&#8217;&#8208;phosphodiesters bearing alcohols with pK  a  ranging from 7.14 to 14.5 catalyzed by AuNPs functionalized with 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane&#8208;Zn(II) complexes has been studied to unravel the source of catalysis by these nanosystems (nanozymes). The results have been compared with those obtained with two Zn(II) dinuclear catalysts for which the mechanism is fairly understood. Binding to the Zn(II) ions by the substrate and the uracil of uridine was observed. The latter leads to inhibition of the process and formation of less productive binding complexes than in the absence of the nucleobase. The nanozyme operates with these substrates mostly via a nucleophilic mechanism with little stabilization of the pentacoordinated phosphorane and moderate assistance in leaving group departure. This is attributed to a decrease of binding strength of the substrate to the catalytic site in reaching the transition state due to an unfavorable binding mode with the uracil. The nanozyme favors substrates with better leaving groups than the less acidic ones.</dc:description>

         <title>Benzenedisulfonic Acid as an ALD/MLD Building Block for Crystalline Metal&#8208;Organic Thin Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report two new ALD/MLD processes for depositing crystalline metal&#8208;organic thin films build from 1,4&#8208;benzenedisulfonate (BDS) as the organic linker and Cu or Li as the metal node. The processes yield in&#8208;situ crystalline but hydrated Cu&#8208;BDS and Li&#8208;BDS films; in the former case, the crystal structure is of a previously known MOF&#8208;like structure, while in the latter case not known from previous studies. Both hydrated materials can be readily dried to obtain the crystalline unhydrated phases. We characterized the stability and the ionic conductivity of the unhydrated Li&#8208;BDS films to assess their applicability as a thin film solid polymer ion conductor.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Bonding in Silicon Carbonyl Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although silylene&#8208;carbonyl complexes are known for decades, only recently isolable examples have been accomplished. In this work, we re&#8208;evaluate the bonding situation to explain the origins of their remarkable stability within the Kohn&#8208;Sham molecular orbital theory framework. We show that the chemical bond can be understood as CO interaction with the silylene  via  a donor&#8208;acceptor interaction: a  &#963;  &#8208;donation from the  &#963;  CO  into the empty  p&#8208;  orbital of silicon, and a  &#960;  &#8208;back donation from the  sp  2  lone pair of silicon into the  &#960;*  CO  antibonding orbitals. Notably, we establish that the driving force behind the surprisingly stable Si&#8722;CO compounds, however, is another  &#960;  &#8208;back donation from a perpendicular bonding R&#8208;Si  &#963;  &#8208;orbital into the  &#960;*  CO  antibonding orbitals. Consequently, the pyramidalization of the central silicon atom cannot be associated with the strength of the  &#960;  &#8208;back donation, in sharp contrast to the established chemical bonding model. Considering this additional bonding interaction not only shed light on the bonding situation, but is also an indispensable key for broadening the scope of silylene&#8208;carbonyl chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Excited State Properties of Lanthanide(III) Complexes with a Nonadentate Bispidine Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Eu  III  , Tb  III  , Gd  III  and Yb  III  complexes of the nonadentate bispidine derivative L  2  (bispidine = 3,7&#8208;diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane) were successfully synthesized and their emission properties studied. The X&#8208;ray crystallography reveals full encapsulation by the nonadentate ligand L  2  , that enforces to all Ln  III  cations a common highly symmetrical capped square antiprismatic (CSAPR) coordination geometry (pseudo C  4v  symmetry). The well&#8208;resolved identical emission spectra in the solid state and in solution confirm equal structures in both media. As therefore expected, this results in long&#8208;lived excited states and high emission quantum yields ([Eu  III  L  2  ]  +  , H  2  O, 298 K, &#964; = 1.51ms, &#966; = 0.35; [Tb  III  L  2  ]  +  , H  2  O, 298 K, &#964; = 1.95ms, &#966; = 0.68).

         <dc:description>
Different pathways: Over the years, SCN&#8208; and SeCN&#8208;containing molecules have received significant attention owing to their importance in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals as well as key intermediates in organic chemistry. Recently, original electrophilic reagents have been designed, offering straightforward synthetic pathways to thiocyanated and selenocyanated molecules. This Minireview will highlight and discuss these recent advances.







Abstract
Organothiocyanate and organoselenocyanate compounds are of paramount importance in organic chemistry as they are key intermediates to access sulfur&#8208; and selenium&#8208;containing compounds. Therefore, among the different synthetic pathways to get SCN&#8208; and SeCN&#8208;containing molecules, original methodologies using electrophilic reagents have recently been explored. This Minireview will showcase the recent advances that have been made. In particular, the design of several electrophilic sources and their applications for the thiocyanation and the selenocyanation of various classes of compounds will be highlighted and discussed.

         <title>Surprising Homolytic Gas Phase Co&#8722;C Bond Dissociation Energies of Organometallic Aryl&#8208;Cobinamides Reveal Notable Non&#8208;Bonded Intramolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crucial resistance of aryl&#8208;cobalamins, as antivitamins B12, against metabolic conversion into B12 cofactors has been traced to their presumed strong organometallic bond. The strength of the Co&#8722;C bond of aryl&#8208;cobinamides was examined here by ESI&#8208;MS threshold collision&#8208;induced dissociation (CID) experiments. Surprisingly, the Co&#8722;C
 bonds of these aryl&#8208;corrins were less strong than the Co&#8722;C
 bond in their methyl analogue, revealing the relevance of non&#8208;bonded interactions.







Abstract
Aryl&#8208;cobalamins are a new class of organometallic structural mimics of vitamin B12 designed as potential &#8216;antivitamins B12&#8217;. Here, the first cationic aryl&#8208;cobinamides are described, which were synthesized using the newly developed diaryl&#8208;iodonium method. The aryl&#8208;cobinamides were obtained as pairs of organometallic coordination isomers, the stereo&#8208;structure of which was unambiguously assigned based on homo&#8208; and heteronuclear NMR spectra. The availability of isomers with axial attachment of the aryl group, either at the &#8216;beta&#8217; or at the &#8216;alpha&#8217; face of the cobalt&#8208;center allowed for an unprecedented comparison of the organometallic reactivity of such pairs. The homolytic gas&#8208;phase bond dissociation energies (BDEs) of the coordination&#8208;isomeric phenyl&#8208; and 4&#8208;ethylphenyl&#8208;cobinamides were determined by ESI&#8208;MS threshold CID experiments, furnishing (Co&#8722;C
)&#8208;BDEs of 38.4 and 40.6&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, respectively, for the two &#946;&#8208;isomers, and the larger BDEs of 46.6 and 43.8&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for the corresponding &#945;&#8208;isomers. Surprisingly, the observed (Co&#8722;C
)&#8208;BDEs of the Co&#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;cobinamides were smaller than the (Co&#8722;C
)&#8208;BDE of Co&#946;&#8208;methyl&#8208;cobinamide. DFT studies and the magnitudes of the experimental (Co&#8722;C
)&#8208;BDEs revealed relevant contributions of non&#8208;bonded interactions in aryl&#8208;cobinamides, notably steric strain between the aryl and the cobalt&#8208;corrin moieties and non&#8208;bonded interactions with and among the peripheral sidechains.

         <title>Mononuclear Dysprosium Alkoxide and Aryloxide Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mononuclear lanthanide single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) have progressively evolved in recent years. Lanthanide alkoxide and aryloxide chemistry offers a modular design approach to study the relaxation dynamics of high&#8208;performing SMMs. Alkoxide and aryloxide ligands on a single axis at a DyIII ion enhances the magnetic anisotropy and the barrier to magnetic reversal (Ueff). Leading examples of DyIII alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs are discussed in this review.







Abstract
Recent studies have shown that mononuclear lanthanide (Ln) complexes can be high&#8208;performing single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs). Recently, there has been an influx of mononuclear Ln alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs, which have provided the necessary geometrical control to improve SMM properties and to allow the intricate relaxation dynamics of Ln SMMs to be studied in detail. Here non&#8208;aqueous Ln alkoxide and aryloxide chemistry applied to the synthesis of low&#8208;coordinate mononuclear Ln SMMs are reviewed. The focus is on mononuclear DyIII alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs with coordination numbers up to eight, covering synthesis, solid&#8208;state structures and magnetic attributes. Brief overviews are also provided of mononuclear TbIII, HoIII, ErIII and YbIII alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs.

         <title>Synthesis of Glycodendrimers with Antiviral and Antibacterial Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sticky scaffolds: The state of the art in the design and synthesis of glycodendrimers for the development of anti&#8208;adhesion therapy against bacterial and viral infections is described.







Abstract
Glycodendrimers are an important class of synthetic macromolecules that can be used to mimic many structural and functional features of cell&#8208;surface glycoconjugates. Their carbohydrate moieties perform key important functions in bacterial and viral infections, often regulated by carbohydrate&#8211;protein interactions. Several studies have shown that the molecular structure, valency and spatial organisation of carbohydrate epitopes in glycoconjugates are key factors in the specificity and avidity of carbohydrate&#8211;protein interactions. Choosing the right glycodendrimers almost always helps to interfere with such interactions and blocks bacterial or viral adhesion and entry into host cells as an effective strategy to inhibit bacterial or viral infections. Herein, the state of the art in the design and synthesis of glycodendrimers employed for the development of anti&#8208;adhesion therapy against bacterial and viral infections is described.

         <title>Tunable Light&#8208;Emission Properties of Solution&#8208;Processable N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Cyclometalated Gold(III) Complexes for Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

         <dc:description>
Golden carbene emitter systems: N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) monocyclometalated gold(III) complexes that efficiently emit in the sky&#8208;blue to green part of the electromagnetic spectrum are reported. A first example of a solution&#8208;processable organic light&#8208;emitting device has been realized for this class of gold(III) complexes, revealing unique opportunities presented by these highly efficient gold(III) carbene emitter systems.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) cyclometalated gold(III) complexes remain very scarce and therefore their photophysical properties remain currently underexplored. Moreover, gold(III) complexes emitting in the blue region of the electromagnetic spectrum are rare. In this work, a series of four phosphorescent gold(III) complexes was investigated bearing four different NHC monocyclometalated (C^C*)&#8208;type ligands and a dianionic (N^N)&#8208;type ancillary ligand ((N^N)=5,5&#8217;&#8208;(propane&#8208;2,2&#8208;diyl)bis(3&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;1&#8201;H&#8208;pyrazole) (mepzH2)). The complexes exhibit strong phosphorescence when doped in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) at room temperature, which were systematically tuned from sky&#8208;blue [&#955;PL=456&#8197;nm, CIE coordinates: (0.20, 034)] to green [&#955;PL=516&#8197;nm, CIE coordinates: (0.31, 0.54)] by varying the monocyclometalated (C^C*) ligand framework. The complexes revealed high quantum efficiencies (&#981;PL) of up to 43&#8201;% and excited&#8208;state lifetimes (&#964;0) between 15&#8211;266&#8197;&#956;s. The radiative rate constant values found for these complexes (kr=103&#8211;104&#8197;s&#8722;1) are the highest found in comparison to previously known best&#8208;performing monocyclometalated gold(III) complexes. Density functional theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations of these complexes further lend support to the excited&#8208;state nature of these complexes. The calculations showed a significant contribution of the gold(III) metal center in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of up to 18&#8201;%, which was found to be unique for this class of cyclometalated gold(III) complexes. Additionally, organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) were fabricated by using a solution process to provide the first insight into the electroluminescent (EL) properties of this new class of gold(III) complexes.

         <title>Co&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Intramolecular [3+2] Cycloaddition of Yne&#8208;Alkylidenecyclopropanes and its Reaction Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Co&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric intramolecular [3+2] reaction of yne&#8208;alkylidenecyclopropanes (yne&#8208;ACPs) using a commercially available ligand has been realized for the synthesis of 5/5 and 6/5 bicycles. This reaction avoids the use of precious Pd and Rh catalysts usually used for these reactions. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction takes places via oxidative cyclometallation of the alkyne and the ACP, ring opening of the cyclopropyl group, and reductive elimination.







Abstract
Developing new transition metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cycloadditions for the synthesis of five&#8208;membered carbocycles (FMCs) is a research frontier in reaction development due to the ubiquitous presence of chiral FMCs in various functional molecules. Reported here is our discovery of a highly enantioselective intramolecular [3+2] cycloaddition of yne&#8208;alkylidenecyclopropanes (yne&#8208;ACPs) to bicyclo[3.3.0]octadiene and bicyclo[4.3.0]nonadiene molecules using a cheap Co catalyst and commercially available chiral ligand (S)&#8208;Xyl&#8208;BINAP. This reaction avoids the use of precious Pd and Rh catalysts, which are usually the choices for [3+2] reactions with ACPs. The enantiomeric excess in the present reaction can be up to 92&#8201;%. Cationic cobalt(I) species was suggested by experiments as the catalytic species. DFT calculations showed that this [3+2] reaction starts with oxidative cyclometallation of alkyne and ACP, followed by ring opening of the cyclopropyl (CP) group and reductive elimination to form the cycloadduct. This mechanism is different from previous [3+2] reactions of ACPs, which usually start from CP cleavage, not from oxidative cyclization.

N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) monocyclometalated gold(III) complexes: Highly efficient photoluminescence was achieved in the sky&#8208;blue to green part of the electromagnetic spectrum using strong s&#8208;donating cyclometalated NHC ligands and a dianionic (N&#8201;N)&#8208;type bidentate as the ancillary ligand. Detailed photophysical investigations supported by density functional theory calculations provide insights into the excited&#8208;state properties of this new class of emitter molecules. The realization of the first solution&#8208;processable OLED device based on these strongly luminescent gold(III) carbene emitter systems opens up exciting new opportunities in light emitting applications.

         <title>Temperature Dependence of 1H Paramagnetic Chemical Shifts in Actinide Complexes, Beyond Bleaney's Theory: The AnVIO22+&#8211;Dipicolinic Acid Complexes (An=Np, Pu) as an Example</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NMR spectroscopy: The temperature dependence of paramagnetic 1H NMR chemical shifts are measured and modelled in the AnVIO22+&#8211;dipicolinic acid complexes. Only the pseudocontact term is non&#8208;zero. The magnetic susceptibility tensor, the energy states and magnetic moments of the paramagnetic center are deduced and compared to the SO&#8208;CASPT2 values.







Abstract
Actinide +VI complexes (
=
, 
 and 
) with dipicolinic acid derivatives were synthesized and characterized by powder XRD, SQUID magnetometry and NMR spectroscopy. In addition, 
 and 
 complexes were described by first principles CAS based and two&#8208;component spin&#8208;restricted DFT methods. The analysis of the 1H paramagnetic NMR chemical shifts for all protons of the ligands according to the X&#8208;rays structures shows that the Fermi contact contribution is negligible in agreement with spin density determined by unrestricted DFT. The magnetic susceptibility tensor is determined by combining SQUID, pNMR shifts and Evans&#8217; method. The SO&#8208;RASPT2 results fit well the experimental magnetic susceptibility and pNMR chemical shifts. The role of the counterions in the solid phase is pointed out; their presence impacts the magnetic properties of the 
 complex. The temperature dependence of the pNMR chemical shifts has a strong 
 contribution, contrarily to Bleaney's theory for lanthanide complexes. The fitting of the temperature dependence of the pNMR chemical shifts and SQUID magnetic susceptibility by a two&#8208;Kramers&#8208;doublet model for the 
 complex and a non&#8208;Kramers&#8208;doublet model for the 
 complex allows for the experimental evaluation of energy gaps and magnetic moments of the paramagnetic center.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NMR spectroscopy&lt;/b&gt;: The temperature dependence of paramagnetic &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR chemical shifts are measured and modelled in the An&lt;sup&gt;VI&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;dipicolinic acid complexes. Only the pseudocontact term is non&#8208;zero. The magnetic susceptibility tensor, the energy states and magnetic moments of the paramagnetic center are deduced and compared to the SO&#8208;CASPT2 values.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actinide +VI complexes (
=
, 
 and 
) with dipicolinic acid derivatives were synthesized and characterized by powder XRD, SQUID magnetometry and NMR spectroscopy. In addition, 
 and 
 complexes were described by first principles CAS based and two&#8208;component spin&#8208;restricted DFT methods. The analysis of the &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H paramagnetic NMR chemical shifts for all protons of the ligands according to the X&#8208;rays structures shows that the Fermi contact contribution is negligible in agreement with spin density determined by unrestricted DFT. The magnetic susceptibility tensor is determined by combining SQUID, pNMR shifts and Evans&#8217; method. The SO&#8208;RASPT2 results fit well the experimental magnetic susceptibility and pNMR chemical shifts. The role of the counterions in the solid phase is pointed out; their presence impacts the magnetic properties of the 
 complex. The temperature dependence of the pNMR chemical shifts has a strong 
 contribution, contrarily to Bleaney's theory for lanthanide complexes. The fitting of the temperature dependence of the pNMR chemical shifts and SQUID magnetic susceptibility by a two&#8208;Kramers&#8208;doublet model for the 
 complex and a non&#8208;Kramers&#8208;doublet model for the 
 complex allows for the experimental evaluation of energy gaps and magnetic moments of the paramagnetic center.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Unveiling Luminescent IrI and RhI N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Complexes: Structure, Photophysical Specifics, and Cellular Localization in the Endoplasmic Reticulum</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anticancer NHC complexes: RhI and IrI N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes provide an auspicious class of potential new anticancer agents; however, cellular imaging with luminescent derivatives of these complex types is often hampered by luminescence quenching. Building on an analysis of the parameters for metal&#8208;induced quenching processes, new examples of this complex class are designed with properties suitable for cellular imaging. Their main localization in the endoplasmic reticulum is not only an unprecedented finding but also represents the first ever insight into the cellular localization of Ir(NHC) complexes in the oxidation state +I.







Abstract
Complexes of RhI and IrI of the [M(COD)(NHC)X] type (where M=Rh or Ir, COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene, NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, and X=halide) have recently shown promising cytotoxic activities against several cancer cell lines. Initial mechanism of action studies provided some knowledge about their interaction with DNA and proteins. However, information about their cellular localization remains scarce owing to luminescence quenching within this complex type. Herein, the synthesis of two rare examples of luminescent RhI and IrI [M(COD)(NHC)I] complexes with 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide&#8208;based emitting ligands is reported. All new complexes are comprehensively characterized, including with single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures. Steric crowding in one derivative leads to two distinct rotamers in solution, which apparently can be distinguished both by pronounced NMR shifts and by their respective spectral and temporal emission signatures. When the photophysical properties of these new complexes are exploited for cellular imaging in HT&#8208;29 and PT&#8208;45 cancer cell lines, it is demonstrated that the complexes accumulate predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is an entirely new finding and provides the first insight into the cellular localization of such IrI(NHC) complexes.

         <title>Carbon Origami via an Alumina&#8208;Assisted Cyclodehydrofluorination Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational folding of nanographenes has the potential to penetrate the barrier between macro&#8208; and micro&#8208;worlds for the engineering of carbon&#8208;based materials with functional molecular shapes. This work reports that an alumina&#8208;mediated C&#8722;F bond activation strategy is able to tackle this challenge allowing both the effective incorporation of non&#8208;hexagonal rings and the formation of helical structures leading to the folding of nanographenes akin to origami.







Abstract
The synthesis of pristine non&#8208;planar nanographenes (NGs) via a cyclodehydrofluorination strategy is reported and the creation of highly strained systems via alumina&#8208;assisted C&#8722;F bond activation is shown. Steric hindrance could execute an alternative coupling program leading to rare octagon formation offering access to elusive non&#8208;classical NGs. The combination of two alternative ways of folding could lead to the formation of various 3D NG objects, resembling the Japanese art of origami. The power of the presented &#8220;origami&#8221; approach is proved by the assembly of 12 challenging nanographenes that are &#960;&#8208;isoelectronic to planar hexabenzocoronene but forced out of planarity.

         <title>Directed Assembly of Multi&#8208;Walled Nanotubes and Nanoribbons of Amino Acid Amphiphiles Using a Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;walled nanotubes and nanoribbons of amino acid amphiphiles are fabricated by using a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer technique, where successive rigid amphiphile layers are glued together by oppositely charged polyelectrolyte. The resulting well&#8208;defined 1D structures are attractive as potential biocompatible delivery systems and building blocks in nanotechnology.







Abstract
Monodisperse unilamellar nanotubes (NTs) and nanoribbons (NRs) were transformed to multilamellar NRs and NTs in a well&#8208;defined fashion. This was done by using a step&#8208;wise approach in which self&#8208;assembled cationic amino acid amphiphile (AAA) formed the initial NTs or NRs, and added polyanion produced an intermediate coating. Successive addition of cationic AAA formed a covering AAA layer, and by repeating this layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) procedure, multi&#8208;walled nanotubes (mwNTs) and nanoribbons were formed. This process was structurally investigated by combining small&#8208;angle neutron scattering (SANS) and cryogenic&#8208;transmission electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;TEM), confirming the multilamellar structure and the precise layer spacing. In this way the controlled formation of multi&#8208;walled suprastructures was demonstrated in a simple and reproducible fashion, which allowed to control the charge on the surface of these 1D aggregates. This pathway to 1D colloidal materials is interesting for applications in life science and creating well&#8208;defined building blocks in nanotechnology.

         <title>Additive&#8208;free Aqueous Dispersions of Two&#8208;Dimensional Materials with Glial Cell Compatibility and Enzymatic Degradability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioelectronics: Processing of additive&#8208;free aqueous dispersions of 2D materials like transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride is demonstrated, and biological implications like cell compatibility and enzymatic degradability are investigated.







Abstract
Water&#8208;dispersible two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials are desirable for diverse applications. Aqueous dispersions make processing safer and greener and enable evaluation of these materials on biological and environmental fronts. To evaluate the effects of 2D materials with biological systems, obtaining dispersions without additives is critical and has been a challenge. Herein, a method was developed for obtaining additive&#8208;free aqueous dispersions of 2D materials like transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN). The nanosheet dispersions were investigated through spectroscopic and microscopic methods, along with the role of size on stability. The aqueous media enabled investigations on cytocompatibility and enzymatic degradation of molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) and h&#8208;BN. Cytocompatibility with mixed glial cells was observed up to concentrations of 100&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1, suggesting their plausible usage in bioelectronics. Besides, biodegradation using human myeloperoxidase (hMPO) mediated catalysis was investigated through Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopy. The findings suggested that additive&#8208;free 2H&#8208;MoS2 and h&#8208;BN were degradable by hMPO, with 2H&#8208;phase exhibiting better resistance to degradation than the 1T&#8208;phase, while h&#8208;BN exhibited slower degradation. The findings pave a path for incorporating 2D materials in the burgeoning field of transient bioelectronics.

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Investigation of the Structural and Opto&#8208;electronic Properties of Fe&#8208;Doped Lead&#8208;Free Cs2AgBiCl6 Double Perovskite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Doubling up: The synthesis and first&#8208;principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations of Fe&#8208;doped, lead&#8208;free dipyramidal shape Cs2AgBiCl6 crystals for photodetector applications are presented. The results of systematic investigation of the crystal structure, morphology, optical properties, band structure, and stability of these materials are discussed.







Abstract
Lead&#8208;free double perovskites have emerged as stable and non&#8208;toxic alternatives to Pb&#8208;halide perovskites. Herein, the synthesis of Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 lead&#8208;free double perovskites are reported that display blue emission using an antisolvent method. The crystal structure, morphology, optical properties, band structure, and stability of the Fe&#8208;doped double perovskites were investigated systematically. Formation of the Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite is confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. XRD and thermo&#8208;gravimetric analysis (TGA) shows that the Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite has high structural and thermal stability, respectively. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE&#8208;SEM) analysis revealed the formation of dipyramidal shape Cs2AgBiCl6 crystals. Furthermore, energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping shows the overlapping of Cs, Bi, Ag, Fe, and Cl elements and homogenous incorporation of Fe in Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite. The Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite shows a strong absorption at 380&#8197;nm. It extends up to 700&#8197;nm, suggesting that sub&#8208;band gap states transition may originate from the surface defect of the doped perovskite material. The radiative kinetics of the crystals was studied using the time&#8208;correlated single&#8208;photon counting (TCSPC) technique. Lattice parameters and band gap value of the Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskites predicted by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations are confirmed by XRD and UV/Visible spectroscopy analysis. Time&#8208;dependent photo&#8208;response characteristics of the Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite show fast response and recovery time of charge carriers. We believe that the successful incorporation of Fe in lead&#8208;free, environmentally friendly Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite can open a new class of doped double perovskites with significant potential optoelectronics devices fabrication and photocatalytic applications.

         <title>Conformational Switching through the One&#8208;Electron Reduction of an Acridinium&#8208;based, &#947;&#8208;Cationic Phosphine Gold Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switch it: The reduction of the acridinium&#8208;based &#947;&#8208;cationic phosphine gold chloride complex neutralizes the carbenium unit and affords a stable radical. Due to a perturbation of the electrostatic potential profile of the complex and donor&#8211;acceptor bonding interactions, this reduction alters the complex's conformation, with the linear phosphine&#8208;gold&#8208;chloride moiety undergoing a windshield&#8208;wiper&#8208;type motion over the surface of the acridinium ring.







Abstract
Our efforts in the chemistry of gold complexes featuring ambiphilic phosphine&#8208;carbenium L/Z&#8208;type ligand have led us to consider the reduction of the carbenium moiety as a means to modulate the gold&#8211;carbenium interaction present in these complexes. Here, it was shown that the one&#8208;electron reduction of [(o&#8208;Ph2P(C6H4)Acr)AuCl]+ (Acr=9&#8208;N&#8208;methylacridinium) produces a neutral stable radical, the structure of which showed a marked increase in the Au&#8211;Acr distance. Related structural changes were observed for the phosphine oxide analogue [(o&#8208;Ph2P(O)(C6H4)Acr]+, the reduction of which interfered with the P=O&#8594;carbenium interaction. These structural effects, driven by a reduction&#8208;induced change in the electronic and electrostatic characteristics of the compounds, showed that the charge and accepting properties of the carbenium unit can be modulated. These results highlight the redox&#8208;noninnocence of carbenium Z&#8208;type ligand, a feature that can be exploited to induce specific conformational changes.

         <dc:description>
PdII catalysed site selective dual C&#8722;C Coupling in the presence of heteroditopic macrobicycle was achieved to synthesize symmetrical and unsymmetrical conjugated 1,3&#8208;diynes.







Abstract
Selectivity of aryl iodo over ethynyl iodo toward the Suzuki cross coupling reaction is explored by utilizing a palladium complex of amino&#8208;ether heteroditopic macrobicycle. Subsequently, unreacted ethynyl iodide undergoes homocoupling reaction in the same catalytic atmosphere, thereby representing a cascade dual C&#8722;C coupling reaction. Furthermore, this approach is extended for novel one&#8208;pot synthesis of unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;diynes.

         <title>Rational Molecular Design of Multifunctional Blue&#8208;Emitting Materials Based on Phenanthroimidazole Derivatives.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deeper blue: On the basis of multifunctional phenanthroimidazole&#8208;based material PTPBPTA, which acts both as a deep&#8208;blue fluorescent emitter and as a host material for phosphors, high&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), yellow and red phosphorescent OLEDs, and a white OLED were fabricated.







Abstract
High&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue emitters with external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) exceeding 5&#8201;% are still scarce in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). In this work, by introducing a [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5&#8208;a] pyridine (TP) unit at the N1 position of phenanthroimidazole (PI), two luminescent materials, PTPTPA and PTPTPA, were obtained. Systematic photophysical analysis showed that the TP block is suitable for constructing hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) emitters. Its moderate electron&#8208;withdrawing ability and rigid planar structure can enhance the CT component while ensuring color purity. In addition, compared with PTPTPA, the additional phenyl ring of PTPBPTA not only increased the oscillator strength, but also decreased the Stokes shift. TDDFT calculations pointed out facile reverse intersystem crossing processes in PTPTPA from high&#8208;lying triplet states to the singlet excited state. A nondoped device based on PTPTPA as emitter showed impressive performance with EQEmax of 7.11&#8201;% and CIE coordinates of (0.15, 0.09). At the same time, it was also an efficient host for yellow and red phosphorescent OLEDs. By doping yellow (PPYBA) and red (BTPG) phosphorescent dyes into PTPTPA, a white OLED with a high EQE of 23.85&#8201;% was achieved. The successful design of PTPTPA not only provided an optimization choice for OLED emitters, but also demonstrated the empirical rules for the design of multifunctional deep&#8208;blue emitters.

In this work, by introducing a [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5&#8208;&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;] pyridine (TP) unit at the N1 position of phenanthroimidazole (PI), two luminescent materials, &lt;b&gt;PTPTPA&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;PTPTPA&lt;/b&gt;, were obtained. Systematic photophysical analysis showed that the TP block is suitable for constructing hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) emitters. Its moderate electron&#8208;withdrawing ability and rigid planar structure can enhance the CT component while ensuring color purity. In addition, compared with &lt;b&gt;PTPTPA&lt;/b&gt;, the additional phenyl ring of PTPBPTA not only increased the oscillator strength, but also decreased the Stokes shift. TDDFT calculations pointed out facile reverse intersystem crossing processes in &lt;b&gt;PTPTPA&lt;/b&gt; from high&#8208;lying triplet states to the singlet excited state. A nondoped device based on &lt;b&gt;PTPTPA&lt;/b&gt; as emitter showed impressive performance with EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 7.11&#8201;% and CIE coordinates of (0.15, 0.09). At the same time, it was also an efficient host for yellow and red phosphorescent OLEDs. By doping yellow (PPYBA) and red (BTPG) phosphorescent dyes into &lt;b&gt;PTPTPA&lt;/b&gt;, a white OLED with a high EQE of 23.85&#8201;% was achieved. The successful design of &lt;b&gt;PTPTPA&lt;/b&gt; not only provided an optimization choice for OLED emitters, but also demonstrated the empirical rules for the design of multifunctional deep&#8208;blue emitters.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Boron Nitride and Carbon Domains in Boron Carbide Nitride Nanotube Supported Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Efficient Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single metal atoms supported on boron carbide nitride nanotubes are considered as promising electrocatalysts for N2 reduction to NH3 with high activity and selectivity. The outstanding performance is ascribed to the synergistic effect of boron nitride and carbon domains, which tuned the charge polarization of metal&#8208;atom active site and the electronic properties of material.







Abstract
Developing the low&#8208;cost and efficient single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is of great importance while remains as a great challenge. The catalytic activity, selectivity and durability are all fundamentally related to the elaborate coordination environment of SACs. Using first&#8208;principles calculations, we investigated the SACs with single transition metal (TM) atom supported on defective boron carbide nitride nanotubes (BCNTs) as NRR electrocatalysts. Our results suggest that boron&#8208;vacancy defects on BCNTs can strongly immobilize TM atoms with large enough binding energy and high thermal/structural stability. Importantly, the synergistic effect of boron nitride (BN) and carbon domains comes up with the modifications of the charge polarization of single&#8208;TM&#8208;atom active site and the electronic properties of material, which has been proven to be the essential key to promote N2 adsorption, activation, and reduction. Specifically, six SACs (namely V, Mn, Fe, Mo, Ru, and W atoms embedded into defective BCNTs) can be used as promising candidates for NRR electrocatalysts as their NRR activity is higher than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the art Ru(0001) catalyst. In particular, single Mo atom supported on defective BCNTs with large tube diameter possesses the highest NRR activity while suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, with a low limiting potential of &#8722;0.62&#8197;V via associative distal path. This work suggests new opportunities for driving NH3 production by carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts under ambient conditions.

Fit in the groove: Hybrid DNAs with Watson&#8211;Crick and purine&#8211;purine base pairs decorated with dendritic side chains are prepared. Space&#8208;demanding side chains introduced into the 7&#8208;position of 5&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deazaguanine&#8211;isoguanine base pairs are well accommodated in the large groove of purine&#8211;purine DNA and have a positive impact on helix stability.







Abstract
The Watson&#8211;Crick coding system depends on the molecular recognition of complementary purine and pyrimidine bases. Now, the construction of hybrid DNAs with Watson&#8211;Crick and purine&#8211;purine base pairs decorated with dendritic side chains was performed. Oligonucleotides with single and multiple incorporations of 5&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deaza&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyguanosine, its tripropargylamine derivative, and 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyisoguanosine were synthesized. Duplex stability decreased if single modified purine&#8211;purine base pairs were inserted, but increased if pyrene residues were introduced by click chemistry. A growing number of consecutive 5&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deazaguanine&#8211;isoguanine base pairs led to strong stepwise duplex stabilization, a phenomenon not observed for the guanine&#8211;isoguanine base pair. Spacious residues are well accommodated in the large groove of purine&#8211;purine DNA tracts. Changes to the global helical structure monitored by circular dichroism spectroscopy show the impact of functionalization to the global double&#8208;helix structure. This study explores new areas of molecular recognition realized by purine base pairs that are complementary in hydrogen bonding, but not in size, relative to canonical pairs.

Gold (I)&#8208;catalyzed higher&#8208;order cycloaddition: 8&#8208;Aryl&#8208;8&#8208;azafulvenes undergo a regioselective gold catalyzed [8+2] cycloaddition with electron&#8208;rich allenamines and ynamides to give dihydrocyclohepta[b]pyrrole derivatives. The cyclization takes place after the nucleophilic attack of the heptafulvene to the electrophilic intermediates formed by the coordination of cationic gold to either allene or triple bond moieties of the unsaturated systems.







Abstract
Gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed higher&#8208;order [8+2] cycloadditions of 8&#8208;aryl&#8208;8&#8208;azaheptafulvenes 1 with allenamides 2 and ynamides 3 were studied. 1,8&#8208;Dihydrocycloheptapyrroles 4 were achieved by a regioselective [8+2] cycloaddition of azaheptafulvenes 1 and allenamides 2 in the presence of (2,4&#8208;ditBuC6H3O)3PAuNTf2 as catalyst. Besides, ynamides 3 and 8&#8208;aryl&#8208;8&#8208;azaheptafulvenes 1, undergo a regioselective [8+2] cycloaddition, to give 2&#8208;amido&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydrocycloheptapyrroles 7 in the presence of JohnPhosAuNTf2 as catalyst. Both reactions take place with good yields and with a variety of substituents. A plausible mechanism hypothesis suggests a nucleophilic attack of the 8&#8208;azaheptafulvene to the gold activated electron rich allene or alkyne moieties of the allenamide and ynamide, respectively.

The material PTPBTPA is reported in this work, which is shown in blue in the cover picture. It can act as a high&#8208;efficiency deep blue emitter as well as an efficient host material for yellow (the color of the bull in the image) and red (the festive color, indicating the coming of the Spring Festival) phosphors. Combining the blue fluorescence and yellow or red phosphorescence produced high&#8208;performance WOLED, which emits white light as the color of the external circle.

         <title>A DNA&#8208;Encoded Chemical Library Based on Peptide Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA&#8208;encoded chemical library (DEL) based on canonical and non&#8208;canonical peptide macrocycles (YO&#8208;DEL) was generated. The single&#8208;stranded format allowed for selections by affinity capture, through a novel selection method exploiting the competition with an antibody fragment and the annealing to a photoreactive moiety which allowed for selections by a photocrosslinking approach. The YO&#8208;DEL yielded ligands against proteins of pharmaceutical interest such as CAIX, HSA and NKp46, a protein expressed on the surface of activated NK&#8208;cells.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of a novel DNA&#8208;encoded library of macrocyclic peptide derivatives are described; the macrocycles are based on three sets of proteinogenic and non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acid building blocks and featuring the use of copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction for ring closure. The library (termed YO&#8208;DEL) which contains 1&#8201;254&#8201;838 compounds, was encoded with DNA in single&#8208;stranded format and was screened against target proteins of interest using affinity capture procedures and photocrosslinking. YO&#8208;DEL selections yielded specific binders against serum albumins, carbonic anhydrases and NKp46, a marker of activated Natural Killer cells.

         <dc:description>
Two dimensional nanomaterials: An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC, HRG//m&#8208;WO3 ASC) fabricated from tungsten oxide (m&#8208;WO3) nanoplates as a negative electrode and highly reduced graphene oxide (HRG) as a positive electrode material attains specific capacitance of 389&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, with an associated high energy density of 93&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 500&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1 in a wide 1.6&#8197;V operating potential window. In addition, the HRG//m&#8208;WO3 ASC displays long&#8208;term cycling&#8208;stability, maintaining around 92&#8201;% of the original specific capacitance after 5000 galvanostatic charge&#8211;discharge cycles.







Abstract
Tungsten oxide/graphene hybrid materials are attractive semiconductors for energy&#8208;related applications. Herein, we report an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC, HRG//m&#8208;WO3 ASC), fabricated from monoclinic tungsten oxide (m&#8208;WO3) nanoplates as a negative electrode and highly reduced graphene oxide (HRG) as a positive electrode material. The supercapacitor performance of the prepared electrodes was evaluated in an aqueous electrolyte (1&#8201;m H2SO4) using three&#8208; and two&#8208;electrode systems. The HRG//m&#8208;WO3 ASC exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of 389&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, with an associated high energy density of 93&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 500&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1 in a wide 1.6&#8197;V operating potential window. In addition, the HRG//m&#8208;WO3 ASC displays long&#8208;term cycling stability, maintaining 92&#8201;% of the original specific capacitance after 5000 galvanostatic charge&#8211;discharge cycles. The m&#8208;WO3 nanoplates were prepared hydrothermally while HRG was synthesized by a modified Hummers method.

         <title>Probing Multiconfigurational States by Spectroscopy: The Cerium XAS L3&#8208;edge Puzzle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ce L3 X&#8208;ray absorption spectra of CeO2 and Ce(C8H8)2 are calculated with relativistic multiconfigurational wavefunction approaches. Calculated spectra are in excellent agreement with experiments. The metal oxidation state in the ground vs. the core&#8208;excited states, and the experimental 4f electron count derived spectroscopically, are fully rationalized.







Abstract
The Ce L3 edge XAS spectra of CeO2 and cerocene [Ce(C8H8)2] were calculated with relativistic ab&#8208;initio multireference wavefunction approaches capable of reproducing the observed spectra accurately. The study aims to resolve the decades&#8208;long puzzle regarding the relationship between the number and relative intensities of the XAS peaks and the 4f electron occupation in the ground state (GS) versus the core&#8208;excited states (ESs). CeO2 and cerocene exemplify the different roles of covalent bonding and wavefunction configurational composition in the observed intensity patterns. Good agreement is found between the calculated GS 4f&#8208;shell occupations and the value derived from XAS measurements using peak areas (nf). The identity of the two&#8208;peaked Ce L3 edge is fully rationalized from the perspective of the relaxed wavefunctions for the GS and core ESs. The states underlying the different peaks differ from each other in a surprisingly simple way that can be associated with 4f1 vs. 4f0 sub&#8208;configurations. Furthermore, part of one of the cerocene spectral peaks is associated with 4f2 sub&#8208;configurations. The pattern therefore reveals excited states that can be interpreted in terms of Ce&#8201;IV and III oxidation numbers, as long assumed, with Ce&#8201;II states additionally appearing in the cerocene spectrum. While this work demonstrates the rough accuracy of the conventional approach to determining nf from Ce L3&#8208;edge XAS, limitations are highlighted in terms of the ultimate accuracy of this approach and the potential of observing new types of excited states. The need to determine the sources of nf by calculations, is stressed.

         <title>Fluorinated Rings: Conformation and Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorine&#8208;containing compounds are widely used in different applications owing to their unique properties and effects. A particularly interesting feature is the impact of the C&#8722;F bond on the conformational preference when incorporated with organic molecules. In this Review, the conformational behavior of fluorinated aliphatic carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic systems will be discussed through presentation of the most recent applications.







Abstract
The introduction of fluorine atoms into molecules and materials across many fields of academic and industrial research is now commonplace, owing to their unique properties. A particularly interesting feature is the impact of fluorine substitution on the relative orientation of a C&#8722;F bond when incorporated into organic molecules. In this Review, we will be discussing the conformational behavior of fluorinated aliphatic carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic systems. The conformational preference of each system is associated with various interactions introduced by fluorine substitution such as charge&#8208;dipole, dipole&#8208;dipole, and hyperconjugative interactions. The contribution of each interaction on the stabilization of the fluorinated alicyclic system, which manifests itself in low conformations, will be discussed in detail. The novelty of this feature will be demonstrated by presenting the most recent applications.

Carbene&#8208;based radicals are important for both fundamental and applied chemical research. Herein, extensive electrochemical investigations of nine different 1,2,3&#8208;triazolylidene selenium adducts are reported. It is found that the half&#8208;wave potentials of the first reduction of the selones correlate with their calculated LUMO levels and the LUMO levels of the corresponding triazolylidene&#8208;based mesoionic carbenes (MICs). Furthermore, unexpected quasi&#8208;reversibility of the reduction of two triazoline selones, exhibiting comparable reduction potentials, was discovered. Through UV/Vis/NIR and EPR spectroelectrochemical investigations supported by DFT calculations, the radical anion was unambiguously assigned to be triazoline centered. This electrochemical behavior was transferred to a triazolylidene&#8208;type MIC&#8208;gold phenyl complex resulting in a MIC&#8208;radical coordinated AuI species. Apart from UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR and EPR spectroelectrochemical investigations of the reduction, the reduced gold&#8208;coordinated MIC radical complex was also formed in situ in the bulk through chemical reduction. This is the first report of a monodentate triazolylidene&#8208;based MIC ligand that can be reduced to its anion radical in a metal complex. The results presented here provide design principles for stabilizing radicals based on MICs.

         <title>Designed Construction of SrTiO3/SrSO4/Pt Heterojunctions with Boosted Photocatalytic H2 Evolution Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photocatalyst is designed with consideration of heterojunction band matching and porous structure. The SrTiO3/SrSO4 heterojunction using Pt as the co&#8208;catalyst reaches 396.82&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is 16&#8197;times higher than that of SrTiO3/Pt. It is proposed that the presence of SrSO4 provides extra channels for electron transportation as well as promoting photocatalytic activity.







Abstract
Efficient separation of photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pairs is a crucial factor for high&#8208;performance photocatalysts. Effective electron&#8211;hole separation and migration could be achieved by heterojunctions with suitable band structures. Herein, a porous SrTiO3/SrSO4 heterojunction is prepared by a sol&#8208;gel method at room temperature followed by an annealing process. XRD characterization suggests high crystallinity of the heterostructure. A well&#8208;defined interface between the two phases is confirmed by high&#8208;resolution (HR)TEM. The photocatalytic H2 evolution productivity of the SrTiO3/SrSO4 heterojunction with Pt as co&#8208;catalyst reaches 396.82&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is 16&#8197;times higher than that of SrTiO3/Pt. The boosted photocatalytic activity of SrTiO3/SrSO4/Pt can be ascribed to the presence of SrSO4, which promotes the transfer and migration of photogenerated carriers by forming the heterojunction and porous structure, which provides a large amount of active sites. This novel porous heterostructure brings new ideas for the development of high&#8208;efficiency photocatalysts for H2 release.

         <title>Organic Nanoparticles with Persistent Luminescence for In Vivo Afterglow Imaging&#8208;Guided Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Afterglow organic nanoparticles (ONPs) with long lifetime and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission offered high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio and good tissue penetration for afterglow imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT) in vivo. Owing to strong afterglow luminescence and abundant singlet oxygen generation from the ONPs upon NIR laser irradiation, they have shown effective suppression of tumor growth after imaging&#8208;guided PDT in mice with minimal damage to major organs.







Abstract
Optical imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT), with precise localization and non&#8208;invasive treatment of tumors, is an emerging technique with great potential for cancer therapy. However, impaired by tissue auto&#8208;fluorescence that causes low signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR), most fluorescence imaging systems show poor sensitivity to tumors in vivo. In this study, we synthesized organic nanoparticles (ONPs) with persistent luminescence and good biocompatibility for afterglow imaging&#8208;guided PDT. The ONPs displayed near&#8208;infrared light emission with half&#8208;life time at minute level, which offered high SBR and good tissue penetration for in vivo afterglow tumor imaging. Taking advantage of their abundant singlet oxygen generation by NIR laser irradiation guided to the tumor sites, the ONPs also enabled imaging&#8208;guided PDT for efficient suppression of tumor growth in mice with minimal damage to major organs.

         <title>Naphthalenediimides with High Fluorescence Quantum Yield: Bright&#8208;Red, Stable, and Responsive Fluorescent Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of a bis&#8208;NH2 core&#8208;substituted naphthalenediimide (NDI) with remarkably high 
. A simple synthetic protocol to NH2&#8208;substituted NDIs is described. Dependent on the substituents, fluorescence can be tuned from bright&#8208;green to the red/NIR region and the 
 modulated by two orders of magnitude. These fluorophores show large Stokes&#8208;shift and great responsiveness to solvent polarity.







Abstract
The naphthalenediimide (NDI) scaffold in contrast to its higher congeners possess low&#8208;fluorescence. In spite of elegant synthetic developments, a highly emissive NDI is quite rare to find, as well as, a green&#8208;light&#8208;emitting NDI is yet to be explored. Herein, we report a novel class of symmetric and asymmetric NH2&#8208;substituted core&#8208;NDIs (1&#8211;5) with tunable fluorescence in the visible region and extending to the NIR frontier. Importantly, the bis&#8208;NH2&#8208;substituted NDI 2 revealed quantum yield, 
 of &#8776;81 and &#8776;68&#8201;% in toluene and DMSO, respectively, suggesting versatility of the fluorophore in a wide range of solvent polarity. The dye 1 is shown to be the first NDI&#8208;based green&#8208;light emitter. The donor piperidine group in 5 diminish the 
 by 40&#8208;fold providing a lever to modulate the excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) process. Our synthetic protocol applies a Pd catalyst and a benign hydride source simplifying the non&#8208;trivial &#8722;NH2 group integration at the NDI&#8208;core. TD&#8208;DFT calculations predicted strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds in the excited state in the bulk nonpolar medium and responsiveness to solvent polarity. The maximization of the NDI emission outlined here would further boost the burgeoning repertoire of applications of the NDI scaffold.

         <title>Uranium versus Thorium: Synthesis and Reactivity of [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U[&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2]</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic reactivity of a stable uranium metallacyclopropene complex, [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U(&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2), was evaluated and compared to that of other uranium and thorium metallacyclopropenes. Although structurally similar, the thorium and uranium metallacyclopropenes exhibit distinctively different reactivity.







Abstract
The synthesis, electronic structure, and reactivity of a uranium metallacyclopropene were comprehensively studied. Addition of diphenylacetylene (PhC&#8801;CPh) to the uranium phosphinidene metallocene [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U=P&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;tBu3C6H2 (1) yields the stable uranium metallacyclopropene, [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U[&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2] (2). Based on density functional theory (DFT) results the 5f orbital contributions to the bonding within the metallacyclopropene U&#8208;(&#951;2&#8208;C=C) moiety increases significantly compared to the related ThIV compound [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2Th[&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2], which also results in more covalent bonds between the [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U2+ and [&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2]2&#8722; fragments. Although the thorium and uranium complexes are structurally closely related, different reaction patterns are therefore observed. For example, 2 reacts as a masked synthon for the low&#8208;valent uranium(II) metallocene [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2UII when reacted with Ph2E2 (E=S, Se), alkynes and a variety of hetero&#8208;unsaturated molecules such as imines, ketazine, bipy, nitriles, organic azides, and azo derivatives. In contrast, five&#8208;membered metallaheterocycles are accessible when 2 is treated with isothiocyanate, aldehydes, and ketones.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The intrinsic reactivity&lt;/b&gt; of a stable uranium metallacyclopropene complex, [&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), was evaluated and compared to that of other uranium and thorium metallacyclopropenes. Although structurally similar, the thorium and uranium metallacyclopropenes exhibit distinctively different reactivity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis, electronic structure, and reactivity of a uranium metallacyclopropene were comprehensively studied. Addition of diphenylacetylene (PhC&#8801;CPh) to the uranium phosphinidene metallocene [&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;U=P&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) yields the stable uranium metallacyclopropene, [&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;U[&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;). Based on density functional theory (DFT) results the 5f orbital contributions to the bonding within the metallacyclopropene U&#8208;(&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;C=C) moiety increases significantly compared to the related Th&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; compound [&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Th[&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;], which also results in more covalent bonds between the [&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;U&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and [&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; fragments. Although the thorium and uranium complexes are structurally closely related, different reaction patterns are therefore observed. For example, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; reacts as a masked synthon for the low&#8208;valent uranium(II) metallocene [&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;U&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; when reacted with Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (E=S, Se), alkynes and a variety of hetero&#8208;unsaturated molecules such as imines, ketazine, bipy, nitriles, organic azides, and azo derivatives. In contrast, five&#8208;membered metallaheterocycles are accessible when &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; is treated with isothiocyanate, aldehydes, and ketones.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Sulfur Tetrahydride and Allied Superhydride Clusters: When Resonance Takes Precedence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
H2S + H2 reactants are (computationally) found to form metastable &#8220;superhydride&#8221; SH4 that in turn forms (SH4&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H2S)n = &#8220;(SH3)2n&#8221; clusters with well&#8208;adapted (x,y,z) geometry for crystallization. Natural resonance theory (NRT) clarifies the uniqueness of the hypervalent bonding in this species.







Abstract
Sulfur offers a variety of bonding surprises compared to the parent oxygen atom of the chalcogen family. In the present work, we employ standard quantum chemistry methods to characterize formation of previously unrecognized sulfur tetrahydride (C4v&#8208;symmetric SH4) from hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and molecular hydrogen (H2) on the ground state potential energy surface. The unusual intramolecular interactions of SH4 defy Lewis&#8208;like bonding conceptions, exhibiting the dominance of resonance&#8208;type donor&#8208;acceptor delocalizations well beyond those of SF4 (C2v sawhorse geometry) and other known tetrahalides. The distressed character of SH4 bonding also leads to exotic intermolecular structural motifs in clusters of pure (SH4)n and mixed (SH4&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H2S)n composition. We evaluate structural, spectroscopic, and electronic properties for various 2D/3D coordination patterns and discuss how (SH4&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H2S)n&#8208;type building blocks may relate to recent experimental studies of superconductivity in high&#8208;pressure materials of &#8220;SH3&#8221; stoichiometry.

         <title>Tuning the Properties of MOF&#8208;808 via Defect Engineering and Metal Nanoparticle Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defects and metal nanoparticle encapsulations have been shown to have significant impacts on structure, texture, morphology and reactivity of the synthesized MOFs. Control over defects creation and metal nanoparticle encapsulations can become useful avenues to adjust the properties of MOFs.







Abstract
Defect engineering and metal encapsulation are considered as valuable approaches to fine&#8208;tune the reactivity of metal&#8211;organic frameworks. In this work, various MOF&#8208;808 (Zr) samples are synthesized and characterized with the final aim to understand how defects and/or platinum nanoparticle encapsulation act on the intrinsic and reactive properties of these MOFs. The reactivity of the pristine, defective and Pt encapsulated MOF&#8208;808 is quantified with water adsorption and CO2 adsorption calorimetry. The results reveal strong competitive effects between crystal morphology and missing linker defects which in turn affect the crystal morphology, porosity, stability, and reactivity. In spite of leading to a loss in porosity, the introduction of defects (missing linkers or Pt nanoparticles) is beneficial to the stability of the MOF&#8208;808 towards water and could also be advantageously used to tune adsorption properties of this MOF family.

         <title>Synthetic Approaches to Selenoesters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selenoesters are an important class of compounds that have wide possibilities for chemical transformations, being considered excellent building blocks for the synthesis of more complex molecules. In this review, an overview of the available methods for the synthesis of selenoesters will be presented. This overview is hoped to serve as a source of inspiration for the development of new strategies for the synthesis of this type of compound, as well as for their use as building blocks in synthesis.







Abstract
Selenoesters are compounds of great synthetic relevance since they can be used in several types of chemical transformations and mainly due to their great capacity in the formation of acyl radicals. Therefore, the scientific community has been developing several methods for the synthesis of this class of molecules. This review will address the synthesis of these compounds from different starting materials, such as carboxylic acids derivatives (acid chlorides and anhydrides), aldehydes, selenoacetylenes and miscellaneous methods.

         <title>Regioselective Synthesis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;Tetrasubstituted Arenes by Vicinal Functionalization of Arynes Derived from Aryl(Mes)iodonium Salts**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Densely functionalized 1,2,3,4&#8208;substituted arenes are found in societally important molecules but are challenging to synthesize. This work reports on a method that uses aryl(Mes)iodonium salts as an aryne precursor via regioselective deprotonation. Various arynophiles are used and result in formation of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;Cl, and C&#8722;Si bonds; mechanistic insights from experiments and DFT calculations are provided.







Abstract
Herein, the synthesis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted benzenoid rings, motifs found in pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and natural products, is described.[1] In the past, the regioselective syntheses of such compounds have been a significant challenge. This work reports a method using substituted arynes derived from aryl(Mes)iodonium salts to access a range of densely functionalized 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted benzenoid rings. Significantly, it was found that halide substituents are compatible under these conditions, enabling post&#8208;synthetic elaboration via palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling. This concise strategy is predicated on two regioselective events: 1)&#8197;ortho&#8208; deprotonation of aryl(Mes)iodonium salts to generate a substituted aryne intermediate, and 2)&#8197;regioselective trapping of said arynes, thereby improving previously reported reaction conditions to generate arynes at room temperature and in shorter reaction times. Density functional theory (DFT) computations and linear free energy relationship (LFER) analysis suggest the regioselectivity of deprotonation is influenced by both proximal and distal ring substituents on the aryne precursor. A competition experiment further reveals the role of arene substituents on relative reactivity of aryl(Mes)iodoniums as aryne precursors.

&lt;p&gt;Herein, the synthesis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted benzenoid rings, motifs found in pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and natural products, is described.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; In the past, the regioselective syntheses of such compounds have been a significant challenge. This work reports a method using substituted arynes derived from aryl(Mes)iodonium salts to access a range of densely functionalized 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted benzenoid rings. Significantly, it was found that halide substituents are compatible under these conditions, enabling post&#8208;synthetic elaboration via palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling. This concise strategy is predicated on two regioselective events: 1)&#8197;&lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;&#8208; deprotonation of aryl(Mes)iodonium salts to generate a substituted aryne intermediate, and 2)&#8197;regioselective trapping of said arynes, thereby improving previously reported reaction conditions to generate arynes at room temperature and in shorter reaction times. Density functional theory (DFT) computations and linear free energy relationship (LFER) analysis suggest the regioselectivity of deprotonation is influenced by both proximal and distal ring substituents on the aryne precursor. A competition experiment further reveals the role of arene substituents on relative reactivity of aryl(Mes)iodoniums as aryne precursors.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Scalable Synthesis of Porous SiFe@C Composite with Excellent Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Threesome is impressive: A novel and scalable strategy for the fabrication of porous SiFe@C composite with mesoporous structure is reported. The conductive phase of FeSi2 is partially retained; together with a uniform carbon layer excellent lithium storage is achieved.







Abstract
Utilizing cost&#8208;effective raw materials to prepare high&#8208;performance silicon&#8208;based anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is both challenging and attractive. Herein, a porous SiFe@C (pSiFe@C) composite derived from low&#8208;cost ferrosilicon is prepared via a scalable three&#8208;step procedure, including ball milling, partial etching, and carbon layer coating. The pSiFe@C material integrates the advantages of the mesoporous structure, the partially retained FeSi2 conductive phase, and a uniform carbon layer (12&#8211;16&#8197;nm), which can substantially alleviate the huge volume expansion effect in the repeated lithium&#8208;ion insertion/extraction processes, effectively stabilizing the solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase (SEI) film and markedly enhancing the overall electronic conductivity of the material. Benefiting from the rational structure, the obtained pSiFe@C hybrid material delivers a reversible capacity of 1162.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200&#8197;cycles at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, with a higher initial coulombic efficiency of 82.30&#8201;%. In addition, it shows large discharge capacities of 803.1 and 600.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 500&#8197;cycles at 2 and 4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively, manifesting an excellent electrochemical lithium storage. This work provides a good prospect for the commercial production of silicon&#8208;based anode materials for LIBs with a high lithium&#8208;storage capacity.

         <title>Chemical Bonding in Homoleptic Carbonyl Cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ (M=Cu, Ag, Au)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Donation of an electron pair from the HOMO of [Fe(CO)5]2 to the 4s LUMO of Cu+ giving the (+,+) component of the Fe&#8208;Cu&#8208;Fe &#963; bond in [Cu{Fe(CO)5}2]+. The associated charge flow with the direction red&#8594;blue is given by the deformation density.







Abstract
Syntheses of the copper and gold complexes [Cu{Fe(CO)5}2][SbF6] and [Au{Fe(CO)5}2][HOB{3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3}3] containing the homoleptic carbonyl cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ (M=Cu, Au) are reported. Structural data of the rare, trimetallic Cu2Fe, Ag2Fe and Au2Fe complexes [Cu{Fe(CO)5}2][SbF6], [Ag{Fe(CO)5}2][SbF6] and [Au{Fe(CO)5}2][HOB{3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3}3] are also given. The silver and gold cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ (M=Ag, Au) possess a nearly linear Fe&#8208;M&#8208;Fe&#8217; moiety but the Fe&#8208;Cu&#8208;Fe&#8217; in [Cu{Fe(CO)5}2][SbF6] exhibits a significant bending angle of 147&#176; due to the strong interaction with the [SbF6]&#8722; anion. The Fe(CO)5 ligands adopt a distorted square&#8208;pyramidal geometry in the cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+, with the basal CO groups inclined towards M. The geometry optimization with DFT methods of the cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ (M=Cu, Ag, Au) gives equilibrium structures with linear Fe&#8208;M&#8208;Fe&#8217; fragments and D2 symmetry for the copper and silver cations and D4d symmetry for the gold cation. There is nearly free rotation of the Fe(CO)5 ligands around the Fe&#8208;M&#8208;Fe&#8217; axis. The calculated bond dissociation energies for the loss of both Fe(CO)5 ligands from the cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ show the order M=Au (De=137.2&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1)&gt;Cu (De=109.0&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1)&gt;Ag (De=92.4&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1). The QTAIM analysis shows bond paths and bond critical points for the M&#8722;Fe linkage but not between M and the CO ligands. The EDA&#8208;NOCV calculations suggest that the [Fe(CO)5]&#8594;M+&#8592;[Fe(CO)5] donation is significantly stronger than the [Fe(CO)5]&#8592;M+&#8594;[Fe(CO)5] backdonation. Inspection of the pairwise orbital interactions identifies four contributions for the charge donation of the Fe(CO)5 ligands into the vacant (n)s and (n)p AOs of M+ and five components for the backdonation from the occupied (n&#8208;1)d AOs of M+ into vacant ligand orbitals.

         <title>Fluorogenic Squaraine Dendrimers for Background&#8208;Free Imaging of Integrin Receptors in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorogenic dendrimer probe for imaging membrane receptors has been developed. It combines eight squaraine dyes that undergo polarity&#8208;dependent aggregation&#8211;disaggregation within the dendrimer, resulting in OFF&#8211;ON fluorescence response to a biomolecular target. It enables integrin&#8208;specific imaging of cancer cells with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio.







Abstract
To overcome the limited brightness of existing fluorogenic molecular probes for biomolecular targets, we introduce a concept of fluorogenic dendrimer probe, which undergoes polarity&#8208;dependent switching due to intramolecular aggregation&#8208;caused quenching of its fluorophores. Based on a rational design of dendrimers with four and eight squaraine dyes, we found that octamer bearing dyes through a sufficiently long PEG(8) linker displays &gt;400&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement from water to non&#8208;polar dioxane. High extinction coefficient (&#8776;2,300,000&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1) resulted from eight squaraine dyes and quantum yield (&#8776;25&#8201;%) make this octamer the brightest environment&#8208;sensitive fluorogenic molecule reported to date. Its conjugate with cyclic RGD used at low concentration (3&#8197;nm) enables integrin&#8208;specific fluorescence imaging of cancer cells with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio. The developed dendrimer probe is a &#8220;golden middle&#8221; between molecular probes and nanoparticles, combining small size, turn&#8208;on response and high brightness, important for bioimaging.

         <title>Specific Ion&#8211;Protein Interactions Influence Bacterial Ice Nucleation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Effects of ions on bacterial ice nucleation: Freezing droplet experiments, sum&#8208;frequency generation spectroscopy, and molecular dynamic simulations were used to demonstrate that ions can profoundly influence the efficiency of bacterial ice nucleators in a manner that follows the Hofmeister series. The different effects are due to specific interactions of the ions with ice&#8208;nucleating proteins on the surface of the bacteria.







Abstract
Ice nucleation&#8208;active bacteria are the most efficient ice nucleators known, enabling the crystallization of water at temperatures close to 0&#8201;&#176;C, thereby overcoming the kinetically hindered phase transition process at these conditions. Using highly specialized ice&#8208;nucleating proteins (INPs), they can cause frost damage to plants and influence the formation of clouds and precipitation in the atmosphere. In nature, the bacteria are usually found in aqueous environments containing ions. The impact of ions on bacterial ice nucleation efficiency, however, has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that ions can profoundly influence the efficiency of bacterial ice nucleators in a manner that follows the Hofmeister series. Weakly hydrated ions inhibit bacterial ice nucleation whereas strongly hydrated ions apparently facilitate ice nucleation. Surface&#8208;specific sum&#8208;frequency generation spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the different effects are due to specific interactions of the ions with the INPs on the surface of the bacteria. Our results demonstrate that heterogeneous ice nucleation facilitated by bacteria strongly depends upon the nature of the ions, and specific ion&#8211;protein interactions are essential for the complete description of heterogeneous ice nucleation by bacteria.

         <title>Metal Cation Valency Dependence in Morphology Evolution of Cu2&#8722;xS Nanodisk Seeds and Their Pseudomorphic Cation Exchanges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tin cation valency&#8208;dependent morphology evolution of Cu2&#8722;xS nanodisk seeds was initially developed. Subsequent pseudomorphic full/partial cation exchanges with Zn2+ and Cd2+ to produce traditionally inaccessible nanostructures were reported as well.







Abstract
A crucial parameter in the design of semiconductor nanoparticles (NPs) with controllable optical, magnetic, electronic, and catalytic properties is the morphology. Herein, we demonstrate the potential of additive metal cations with variable valency to direct the morphology evolution of copper&#8208;deficient Cu2&#8722;xS nanoparticles in the process of seed&#8208;mediated growth. In particular, the djurleite Cu1.94S seed could evolve from disk into tetradecahedron in the presence of tin(IV) cations, whereas they merely formed sharp hexagonal nanodisks with tin(II) cations. In addition to djurleite Cu1.94S, the tin(IV) cations could be generalized to direct the growth of roxbyite Cu1.8S and covellite CuS nanodisk seeds into tetradecahedra. We further perform pseudomorphic cation exchanges of Cu1.94S tetradecahedra with Zn2+ and Cd2+ to produce polyhedral zinc sulfide (ZnS) and cadmium sulfide (CdS) NPs. Moreover, we achieve Cu1.8S/ZnS and Cu1.94S/CdS tetradecahedral heterostructures via partial cation exchange, which are otherwise inaccessible by traditional synthetic approaches.

         <title>Overview of N&#8208;Rich Antennae Investigated in Lanthanide&#8208;Based Temperature Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Noncontact temperature sensors are gaining importance. Lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensors stand out as they benefit form for example, high photostability. In this Review, an extensive overview on N&#8208;rich antennae used in lanthanide based temperature sensing is provided. The potential of N&#8208;rich small molecules, bi&#8208;and polynuclear complexes, metal organic frameworks, periodic mesoporous organosilicas and porous organic polymers are discussed.







Abstract
The market share of noncontact temperature sensors is expending due to fast technological and medical evolutions. In the wide variety of noncontact sensors, lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensors stand out. They benefit from high photostability, relatively long decay times and high quantum yields. To circumvent their low molar light absorption, the incorporation of a light&#8208;harvesting antenna is required. This Review provides an overview of the nitrogen&#8208;rich antennae in lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensors, emitting in the visible light spectrum, and discusses their temperature sensor ability. The N&#8208;rich ligands are incorporated in many different platforms. The investigation of different antennae is required to develop temperature sensors with diverse optical properties and to create a diverse offer for the multiple application fields. Molecular probes, consisting of small molecules, are first discussed. Furthermore, the thermometer properties of ratiometric temperature sensors, based on di&#8208; and polynuclear complexes, metal&#8211;organic frameworks, periodic mesoporous organosilicas and porous organic polymers, are summarized. The antenna mainly determines the application potential of the ratiometric thermometer. It can be observed that molecular probes are operational in the broad physiological range, metal&#8211;organic frameworks are generally very useful in the cryogenic region, periodic mesoporous organosilica show temperature dependency in the physiological range, and porous organic polymers are operative in the cryogenic&#8208;to&#8208;medium temperature range.

         <title>Biological and Medical Applications of Calcium Phosphate Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium phosphate nanoparticles are well suited to transport organic or biological molecules into cells and tissue. They are well tolerated by cells and organisms and have a clearly defined degradation pathway, also due to their almost ubiquitous presence in the body. Promising applications for them are seen in drug and gene delivery and also in immunization, for example, for vaccination. This Review explores the synthesis, characterization, functionalization and biomedical applications of calcium phosphate nanoparticles from the recent literature.







Abstract
Calcium phosphate nanoparticles have a high biocompatibility and biodegradability due to their chemical similarity to human hard tissue, for example, bone and teeth. They can be used as efficient carriers for different kinds of biomolecules such as nucleic acids, proteins, peptides, antibodies, or drugs, which alone are not able to enter cells where their biological effect is required. They can be loaded with cargo molecules by incorporating them, unlike solid nanoparticles, and also by surface functionalization. This offers protection, for example, against nucleases, and the possibility for cell targeting. If such nanoparticles are functionalized with fluorescing dyes, they can be applied for imaging in vitro and in vivo. Synthesis, functionalization and cell uptake mechanisms of calcium phosphate nanoparticles are discussed together with applications in transfection, gene silencing, imaging, immunization, and bone substitution. Biodistribution data of calcium phosphate nanoparticles in vivo are reviewed.

         <title>Engineered Bifunctional Luminescent Pillared&#8208;Layer Frameworks for Adsorption of CO2 and Sensitive Detection of Nitrobenzene in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Space for guests: Five isoreticular luminescent pillared&#8208;layer metal&#8211;organic frameworks showing CO2 uptake and the sensitive detection of nitrobenzene (NB) in aqueous solution are engineered. The NB&#8208;included framework provides direct evidence for framework&#8211;NB interactions.







Abstract
Through a dual&#8208;ligand synthetic approach, five isoreticular primitive cubic (pcu)&#8208;type pillared&#8208;layer metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), [Zn2(dicarboxylate)2(NI&#8208;bpy&#8208;44)]&#8901;x&#8201;DMF&#8901;y&#8201;H2O, in which dicarboxylate=1,4&#8208;bdc (1), Br&#8208;1,4&#8208;bdc (2), NH2&#8208;1,4&#8208;bdc (3), 2,6&#8208;ndc (4), and bpdc (5), have been engineered. MOFs 1&#8211;5 feature twofold degrees of interpenetration and have open pores of 27.0, 33.6, 36.8, 52.5, and 62.1&#8201;%, respectively. Nitrogen adsorption isotherms of activated MOFs 1&#8242;&#8211;5&#8242; at 77&#8197;K all displayed type&#8197;I adsorption behavior, suggesting their microporous nature. Although 1&#8242; and 3&#8242;&#8211;5&#8242; exhibited type&#8197;I adsorption isotherms of CO2 at 195&#8197;K, MOF 2&#8242; showed a two&#8208;step gate&#8208;opening sorption isotherm of CO2. Furthermore, MOF 3&#8242; also had a significant influence of amine functions on CO2 uptake at high temperature due to the CO2&#8211;framework interactions. MOFs 1&#8211;5 revealed solvent&#8208;dependent fluorescence properties; their strong blue&#8208;light emissions in aqueous suspensions were efficiently quenched by trace amounts of nitrobenzene (NB), with limits of detection of 4.54, 5.73, 1.88, 2.30, and 2.26&#8197;&#956;m, respectively, and Stern&#8211;Volmer quenching constants (Ksv) of 2.93&#215;103, 1.79&#215;103, 3.78&#215;103, 4.04&#215;103, and 3.21&#215;103&#8201;m&#8722;1, respectively. Of particular note, the NB&#8208;included framework, NB@3, provided direct evidence of the binding sites, which showed strong host&#8211;guest &#960;&#8211;&#960; and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions beneficial for donor&#8211;acceptor electron transfer and resulting in fluorescence quenching.

&lt;p&gt;Through a dual&#8208;ligand synthetic approach, five isoreticular primitive cubic (pcu)&#8208;type pillared&#8208;layer metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), [Zn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(dicarboxylate)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(NI&#8208;bpy&#8208;44)]&lt;b&gt;&#8901;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&#8201;DMF&lt;b&gt;&#8901;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, in which dicarboxylate=1,4&#8208;bdc (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), Br&#8208;1,4&#8208;bdc (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;1,4&#8208;bdc (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), 2,6&#8208;ndc (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;), and bpdc (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;), have been engineered. MOFs &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; feature twofold degrees of interpenetration and have open pores of 27.0, 33.6, 36.8, 52.5, and 62.1&#8201;%, respectively. Nitrogen adsorption isotherms of activated MOFs &lt;b&gt;1&#8242;&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;5&#8242;&lt;/b&gt; at 77&#8197;K all displayed type&#8197;I adsorption behavior, suggesting their microporous nature. Although &lt;b&gt;1&#8242;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&#8242;&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;5&#8242;&lt;/b&gt; exhibited type&#8197;I adsorption isotherms of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at 195&#8197;K, MOF &lt;b&gt;2&#8242;&lt;/b&gt; showed a two&#8208;step gate&#8208;opening sorption isotherm of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Furthermore, MOF &lt;b&gt;3&#8242;&lt;/b&gt; also had a significant influence of amine functions on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake at high temperature due to the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;framework interactions. MOFs &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; revealed solvent&#8208;dependent fluorescence properties; their strong blue&#8208;light emissions in aqueous suspensions were efficiently quenched by trace amounts of nitrobenzene (NB), with limits of detection of 4.54, 5.73, 1.88, 2.30, and 2.26&#8197;&#956;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;, respectively, and Stern&#8211;Volmer quenching constants (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;sv&lt;/sub&gt;) of 2.93&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, 1.79&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, 3.78&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, 4.04&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and 3.21&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;
&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Of particular note, the NB&#8208;included framework, NB@&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;, provided direct evidence of the binding sites, which showed strong host&#8211;guest &#960;&#8211;&#960; and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions beneficial for donor&#8211;acceptor electron transfer and resulting in fluorescence quenching.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Catalytic Performance of Zr&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Zr&#8208;abtc and MIP&#8208;200 in Selective Oxidations with H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An eight&#8208;connected metal&#8211;organic framework Zr&#8208;abtc catalyzes a range of H2O2&#8208;based selective oxidations. The significant predominance of 1,2&#8208;epoxide in the epoxidation of carvone and high sulfone selectivity in thioether oxidation point to a nucleophilic oxidation mechanism. With highly reactive alkenes, such as caryophyllene, electrophilic oxidation can also be realized.







Abstract
The catalytic performance of Zr&#8208;abtc and MIP&#8208;200 metal&#8211;organic frameworks consisting of 8&#8208;connected Zr6 clusters and tetratopic linkers was investigated in H2O2&#8208;based selective oxidations and compared with that of 12&#8208;coordinated UiO&#8208;66 and UiO&#8208;67. Zr&#8208;abtc demonstrated advantages in both substrate conversion and product selectivity for epoxidation of electron&#8208;deficient C=C bonds in &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. The significant predominance of 1,2&#8208;epoxide in carvone epoxidation, coupled with high sulfone selectivity in thioether oxidation, points to a nucleophilic oxidation mechanism over Zr&#8208;abtc. The superior catalytic performance in the epoxidation of unsaturated ketones correlates with a larger amount of weak basic sites in Zr&#8208;abtc. Electrophilic activation of H2O2 can also be realized, as evidenced by the high activity of Zr&#8208;abtc in epoxidation of the electron&#8208;rich C=C bond in caryophyllene. XRD and FTIR studies confirmed the retention of the Zr&#8208;abtc structure after the catalysis. The low activity of MIP&#8208;200 in H2O2&#8208;based oxidations is most likely related to its specific hydrophilicity, which disfavors adsorption of organic substrates and H2O2.

         <title>New Noncentrosymmetric Tetrel Pnictides Composed of Square&#8208;Planar Gold(I) with Peculiar Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bonding natures: Compared with common types of AuI coordination observed in extended solids, square&#8208;planar coordination is rare. Au(I)relia shows off the three&#8208;centered bonding of Au&#8722;Tt&#8722;Au and Au&#8722;Pn&#8722;Au (on her feathers; Tt=tetrel, Pn=pnictogen), square&#8208;planar cis&#8208;[AuTt2Pn2] units (her body), and linear chains of Au (her legs) that are characteristic of equiatomic AuSiAs, AuGeP, and AuGeAs compounds.







Abstract
Three novel isostructural equiatomic gold tetrel pnictides, AuSiAs, AuGeP, and AuGeAs, were synthesized and characterized. These phases crystallize in the noncentrosymmetric (NCS) monoclinic space group Cc (no. 9), featuring square&#8208;planar Au within cis&#8208;[AuTt2Pn2] units (Tt=tetrel, Si, Ge; Pn=pnictogen, P, As). This is in drastic contrast to the structure of previously reported AuSiP, which exhibits typical linear coordination of Au with Si and P. Chemical bonding analysis through the electron localization function suggests covalent two&#8208;center two&#8208;electron Tt&#8722;Pn bonds, and three&#8208;center Au&#8722;Tt&#8722;Au and Au&#8722;Pn&#8722;Au bonds with 1.6&#8197;e&#8722; per bond. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies support the covalent and nonionic nature of Au&#8722;Pn and Au&#8722;Tt bonds. The title materials were found to be n&#8208;type narrow&#8208;gap semiconductors or semimetals, with nearly temperature&#8208;independent electrical resistivities and low thermal conductivities. A combination of the semimetallic properties with tunable NCS structure provides opportunities for the development of materials based on gold tetrel pnictides.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Achiral Metal&#8211;Organic Colloids and Guest Molecules in a Vortex Field</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spinning around: Two metal&#8211;organic colloids based on achiral starting materials show active CD and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties in a vortex field. The optical properties of the colloids can be transferred to achiral Rhodamine derivatives, with glum 10&#8722;2 in magnitude and quantum yields of 40&#8211;83&#8201;%.







Abstract
Recently, scientists have reported a range of chiral fluorescence materials or chiral composites that can emit circularly polarized luminescence. Herein, two achiral metal&#8211;organic colloidal solutions were studied, showing active circularly polarized luminescence, which is observed in vortex stirring. The absolute values for glum are 0.05 and 0.03 and the plus or minus sign of glum depends on the colloidal structure and stirring direction, which make the property easy to manipulate. Further, the host&#8211;guest interaction study suggests both electrostatic interactions and coordination bonding may influence the chiroptical property from the colloidal solution to the guest molecule. Rhodamine 6G and its carboxylic acid derivative exhibit good quantum yields and acceptable glum values in the colloidal solution.

         <title>Altered Membrane Mechanics Provides a Receptor&#8208;Independent Pathway for Serotonin Action</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is known that serotonin binds to lipid membranes with high affinity, but what does it do to it? We find that it makes artificial lipid bilayers softer and easier to indent by an AFM tip (top), and promotes disorder in ordered regions. For cell membranes, this effect facilitates increased endocytosis (bottom). This increase occurs even when the serotonin receptors are blocked, providing a receptor&#8208;independent pathway for serotonin action.







Abstract
Serotonin, an important signaling molecule in humans, has an unexpectedly high lipid membrane affinity. The significance of this finding has evoked considerable speculation. Here we show that membrane binding by serotonin can directly modulate membrane properties and cellular function, providing an activity pathway completely independent of serotonin receptors. Atomic force microscopy shows that serotonin makes artificial lipid bilayers softer, and induces nucleation of liquid disordered domains inside the raft&#8208;like liquid&#8208;ordered domains. Solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy corroborates this data at the atomic level, revealing a homogeneous decrease in the order parameter of the lipid chains in the presence of serotonin. In the RN46A immortalized serotonergic neuronal cell line, extracellular serotonin enhances transferrin receptor endocytosis, even in the presence of broad&#8208;spectrum serotonin receptor and transporter inhibitors. Similarly, it increases the membrane binding and internalization of oligomeric peptides.

     alt="Altered Membrane Mechanics Provides a Receptor&#8208;Independent Pathway for Serotonin Action"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It is known that serotonin binds&lt;/b&gt; to lipid membranes with high affinity, but what does it do to it? We find that it makes artificial lipid bilayers softer and easier to indent by an AFM tip (top), and promotes disorder in ordered regions. For cell membranes, this effect facilitates increased endocytosis (bottom). This increase occurs even when the serotonin receptors are blocked, providing a receptor&#8208;independent pathway for serotonin action.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serotonin, an important signaling molecule in humans, has an unexpectedly high lipid membrane affinity. The significance of this finding has evoked considerable speculation. Here we show that membrane binding by serotonin can directly modulate membrane properties and cellular function, providing an activity pathway completely independent of serotonin receptors. Atomic force microscopy shows that serotonin makes artificial lipid bilayers softer, and induces nucleation of liquid disordered domains inside the raft&#8208;like liquid&#8208;ordered domains. Solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy corroborates this data at the atomic level, revealing a homogeneous decrease in the order parameter of the lipid chains in the presence of serotonin. In the RN46A immortalized serotonergic neuronal cell line, extracellular serotonin enhances transferrin receptor endocytosis, even in the presence of broad&#8208;spectrum serotonin receptor and transporter inhibitors. Similarly, it increases the membrane binding and internalization of oligomeric peptides. Our results uncover a mode of serotonin&#8211;membrane interaction that can potentiate key cellular processes in a receptor&#8208;independent fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Multiply Charged Helium Droplet Anions</title>

         <dc:description>
Charged droplets: The detection of multiply charged helium droplet anions is reported for the first time. By ionizing droplets of superfluid helium with low energy electrons (up to 25&#8197;eV), it was possible to produce droplets containing up to five negative charges, which remain intact on the timescale of the experiment.







Abstract
The detection of multiply charged helium droplet anions is reported for the first time. By ionizing droplets of superfluid helium with low energy electrons (up to 25&#8197;eV), it was possible to produce droplets containing up to five negative charges, which remain intact on the timescale of the experiment. The appearance sizes for different charge states are determined and are found to be orders of magnitude larger than for the equivalent cationic droplets, starting at 4 million He atoms for dianions. Droplets with He*&#8722; as charge carriers show signs of being metastable, but this effect is quenched by the pickup of water molecules.

         <title>Characterization of the Simplest Thiolimine: The Higher Energy Tautomer of Thioformamide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Keep it simple! Thioamides resemble viable prebiotic building blocks for biologically relevant molecules. However, only a handful of experimental reports on parent thioformamide exist. X&#8208;ray diffraction data of thioformamide are reported and its tautomerization induced by UV irradiation under cryogenic conditions is presented. Four conformers of the corresponding thiolimine form, whose (tunneling) reactivity is investigated.







Abstract
As sulfur&#8208;containing organic molecules thioamides and their isomers are conceivable intermediates in prebiotic chemistry, for example, in the formation of amino acids and thiazoles and resemble viable candidates for detection in interstellar media. Here, we report the characterization of parent thioformamide in the solid state via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and its photochemical interconversion to its hitherto unreported higher energy tautomer thiolimine in inert argon and dinitrogen matrices. Upon photogeneration, four conformers of thiolimine form, whose ratio depends on the employed wavelength. One of these conformers interconverts due to quantum mechanical tunneling with a half&#8208;life of 30&#8211;45&#8197;min in both matrix materials at 3 and 20&#8197;K. A spontaneous reverse reaction from thiolimine to thioformamide is not observed. To support our experimental findings, we explored the potential energy surface of the system at the AE&#8208;CCSD(T)/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pCVTZ level of theory and computed tunneling half&#8208;lives with the CVT/SCT approach applying DFT methods.

         <title>Tunable Anticancer Activity of Furoylthiourea&#8208;Based RuII&#8211;Arene Complexes and Their Mechanism of Action</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multitasking! Fourteen new Ru&#8211;arene (p&#8208;cymene or benzene) complexes bearing different furoylthiourea ligands have been synthesized and characterized. All the complexes were found to be highly toxic towards IMR&#8208;32 cancer cells. The complexes catalytically oxidized glutathione and promoted cell death by apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. They also showed good binding ability with receptors commonly overexpressed in cancer cells.







Abstract
Fourteen new RuII&#8211;arene (p&#8208;cymene/benzene) complexes (C1&#8211;C14) have been synthesized by varying the N&#8208;terminal substituent in the furoylthiourea ligand and satisfactorily characterized by using analytical and spectroscopic techniques. Electrostatic potential maps predicted that the electronic effect of the substituents was mostly localized, with some influence seen on the labile chloride ligands. The structure&#8211;activity relationships of the Ru&#8211;p&#8208;cymene and Ru&#8211;benzene complexes showed opposite trends. All the complexes were found to be highly toxic towards IMR&#8208;32 cancer cells, with C5 (Ru&#8211;p&#8208;cymene complex containing C6H2(CH3)3 as N&#8208;terminal substituent) and C13 (Ru&#8211;benzene complex containing C6H4(CF3) as N&#8208;terminal substituent) showing the highest activity among each set of complexes, and hence they were chosen for further study. These complexes showed different behavior in aqueous solutions, and were also found to catalytically oxidize glutathione. They also promoted cell death by apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, the complexes showed good binding ability with the receptors Pim&#8208;1 kinase and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, commonly overexpressed in cancer cells.

Strong candidates! The synthesis and structural characterization of ferrocene&#8208;appended &#946;&#8208;ketoimines and their BF2 complexes is reported. A study of their photophysical properties revealed that both the &#946;&#8208;ketoimines and their BF2 complexes show aggregation&#8208;induced emission and a strong second&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) response, and thus are excellent multifunctional candidates for NLO and luminescence applications.







Abstract
A series of new &#946;&#8208;ketoimines containing a ferrocene moiety and their BF2 complexes have been synthesized and structurally characterized. The solvatochromism of the &#946;&#8208;ketoimines was studied, putting in evidence a redshift with increasing solvent polarity. This positive solvatochromism can be attributed to a more polarized excited state compared with the ground state, due to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transitions. The &#946;&#8208;ketoimines exhibited weak emission, attributable to the excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) phenomenon. This ESIPT effect is suppressed upon restriction of the keto&#8208;enamine tautomerism, induced upon addition of BF3&#8901;OEt2, which afforded the related BF2 complexes, characterized by an enhancement of the fluorescence through the ICT effect. Both the &#946;&#8208;ketoimines and BF2 complexes exhibited significant aggregation&#8208;induced emission behavior in mixtures of CH3CN/H2O, due to restriction of intramolecular rotation in the aggregated state. The frontier molecular orbital levels, ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state dipole moments (&#956;g and &#956;e), and the origin of electronic absorption spectra were studied by time&#8208;dependent DFT calculations. The second&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) properties were determined by the electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced second&#8208;harmonic generation technique. The &#956;&#946;1907 values of the &#946;&#8208;ketoimines increased upon the formation of the related BF2 complexes, mainly due to an enhancement of the ground&#8208;state dipole moment. The results presented here reveal that some of these novel compounds are excellent multifunctional candidates for NLO and luminescence applications.

         <title>Controlling Emissive Properties by Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonds: Alkyl and Aryl meso&#8208;Substituted Porphycenes</title>

Abstract
Porphycene, a porphyrin isomer, is an efficient fluorophore. However, four&#8208;fold meso substitution with alkyl groups decreases the fluorescence quantum yield by orders of magnitude. For aryl substituents, this effect is small. To explain this difference, we have synthesized and studied a mixed aryl&#8208;alkyl&#8208;substituted compound, 9,20&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;10,19&#8208;dimethylporphycene, as well as the 9,20&#8208;diphenyl and 9,20&#8208;dimethyl derivatives. Analysis of the structural, spectroscopic, and photophysical data of the six porphycenes, combined with quantum chemical calculations, shows a clear correlation between the strength of the intramolecular NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N hydrogen bonds and the efficiency of the radiationless depopulation of the lowest&#8208;excited singlet state. This result led us to propose a model in which the delocalization of the inner protons in the cavity of the macrocycle is responsible for the nonradiative deactivation channel. The applicability of the model is confirmed by the literature data for other alkyl&#8208; or aryl&#8208;substituted porphycenes. The finding of a correlation between structural and emissive characteristics enables a rational design of porphycenes with desired photophysical properties.

Abstract
We report on the results of an in&#8197;situ synchrotron powder X&#8208;ray diffraction study of the crystallisation in aqueous medium of two recently discovered perfluorinated CeIV&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), analogues of the already well investigated ZrIV&#8208;based UiO&#8208;66 and MIL&#8208;140A, namely, F4_UiO&#8208;66(Ce) and F4_MIL&#8208;140A(Ce). The two MOFs were originally obtained in pure form in similar conditions, using ammonium cerium nitrate and tetrafluoroterephthalic acid as reagents, and small variations of the reaction parameters were found to yield mixed phases. Here, we investigate the crystallisation of these compounds, varying parameters such as temperature, amount of the protonation modulator nitric acid and amount of the coordination modulator acetic acid. When only HNO3 is present in the reaction environment, only F4_MIL&#8208;140A(Ce) is obtained. Heating preferentially accelerates nucleation, which becomes rate determining below 57&#8201;&#176;C. Upon addition of AcOH to the system, alongside HNO3, mixed&#8208;phased products are obtained. F4_UiO&#8208;66(Ce) is always formed faster, and no interconversion between the two phases occurs. In the case of F4_UiO&#8208;66(Ce), crystal growth is always the rate&#8208;determining step. A higher amount of HNO3 favours the formation of F4_MIL&#8208;140A(Ce), whereas increasing the amount of AcOH favours the formation of F4_UiO&#8208;66(Ce). Based on the in&#8197;situ results, a new optimised route to achieving a pure, high&#8208;quality F4_MIL&#8208;140A(Ce) phase in mild conditions (60&#8201;&#176;C, 1&#8197;h) is also identified.

The European Young Chemists&#8217; Network (EYCN) has been actively collaborating with the European Chemical Society (EuChemS) to create a platform for early&#8208;career scientists to contribute to policy&#8208;making in Europe. This article comments on the roles of chemists in policy&#8208;making and provides an overview of the initiatives and platforms for influencing at the European level from the perspective of early&#8208;career chemists, hoping to stimulate further engagement.







Abstract
Global societal challenges emphasize the importance of collaboration between scientists and policy&#8208;makers, while the participation of a diverse group of professionals, including early&#8208;career scientists, is critical towards a sustainable future. The European Young Chemists&#8217; Network (EYCN) has been actively working with the European Chemical Society (EuChemS) to create a platform for early&#8208;career chemists in policy advice. This article comments on the possible roles of scientists in policy&#8208;making and provides an overview of relevant initiatives and platforms at the European level that could facilitate involvement. Opportunities for participation in policy advice from the perspective of early&#8208;career chemists are discussed and examples of impact are provided, hoping to stimulate further discussions and engagement in policy&#8208;making.

         <title>The Missing Parent Compound [(C5H5)Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)]: Synthesis, Characterization, Coordination Behavior and Encapsulation</title>

Abstract
The so far missing parent compound of the large family of pentaphosphaferrocenes [CpFe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (1&#8201;b) was synthesized by the thermolysis of [CpFe(CO)2]2 with P4 using the very high&#8208;boiling solvent diisopropylbenzene. It was comprehensively characterized by, inter alia, NMR spectroscopy, single crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis, cyclic voltammetry and DFT computations. Moreover, its coordination behavior towards CuI halides was explored, revealing the unprecedented 2D polymeric networks [{CpFe(&#951;5:1:1:1:1&#8208;P5)}Cu2(&#956;&#8208;X)2]n (2&#8201;a: X=Cl, 2&#8201;b: X=Br) and [{CpFe(&#951;5:1:1&#8208;P5)}Cu(&#956;&#8208;I)]n (3) and even the first cyclo&#8208;P5&#8208;containing 3D coordination polymer [{CpFe(&#951;5:1:1&#8208;P5)}Cu(&#956;&#8208;I)]n (4). The sandwich complex&#8197;1&#8201;b can also be incorporated in nano&#8208;sized supramolecules based on [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (1&#8201;a) and CuX (X=Cl, Br, I): [CpFe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)]@[{Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)}12(CuX)20&#8208;n] (5&#8201;a: X=Cl, n=2.4; 5&#8201;b: X=Br, n=2.4; 5&#8201;c: X=I, n=0.95). Thereby, the formation of the CuI&#8208;containing fullerene&#8208;like sphere 5&#8201;c is found for the first time.

Abstract
In recent years, luminescent materials doped with Ln3+ ions have attracted much attention for their application as optical thermometers based on both downshifting and upconversion processes. This study presents research done on the development of highly sensitive optical thermometers in the physiological temperature range based on poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) films doped with two series of visible Ln3+ complexes (Ln3+=Tb3+, Eu3+, and Sm3+) and SiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) coated with these PMMA films. The best performing PMMA film doped with Tb3+ and Eu3+ complexes was the PMMA[TbEuL1tppo]1 film (L1=4,4,4&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadionate; tppo=triphenylphosphine oxide), which showed good temperature sensing of Sr=4.21&#8201;%&#8201;K&#8722;1 at 313&#8197;K, whereas for the PMMA films doped with Tb3+ and Sm3+ complexes the best performing was the PMMA[TbSmL2tppo]3 film (L2=4,4,4&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;1&#8208;(4&#8208;chlorophenyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadionate), with Sr=3.64&#8201;%&#8201;K&#8722;1 at 313&#8197;K. Additionally, SiO2 NPs coated with the best performing films from each of the series of PMMA films (Tb&#8211;Eu and Tb&#8211;Sm) and their temperature&#8208;sensing properties were studied in water, showing excellent performance in the physiological temperature range (PMMA[TbEuL1tppo]1@SiO2: Sr=3.84&#8201;%&#8201;&#176;C at 20&#8201;&#176;C; PMMA[TbSmL2tppo]3@SiO2: Sr=3.27&#8201;%&#8201;&#176;C at 20&#8201;&#176;C) and the toxicity of these nanoparticles on human cells was studied, showing that they were nontoxic.

         <title>Directing Polymorphism in the Helical Nanofilament Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymorphism is defined as the formation of more than two kinds of crystal structures from a single compound, which is essential for practical applications such as pharmaceuticals and agriculture. Stimuli&#8208;responsive polymorphism of the helical nanofilament (HNF) is investigated by using light&#8208;driven and nanoconfinement methods. The light&#8208;driven HNFs form the twisted ribbons, while the nanoconfined HNFs show the cylindrical ribbons. The discovery of polymorphism on HNF structures will provide insights for future studies on chirality. More information can be found in the Full Paper by D.&#8197;K. Yoon et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202005221).

         <title>Enantioselective Aromatic Amination?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
The atroposelective formation of C&#8722;N bonds has recently emerged within the field of amination reactions. On first sight, it may seem quite surprising that such an ancient class of organic coupling reactions (Gabriel, Ullmann, Goldberg, Buchwald, Hartwig and many others) has so few enantioselective solutions, and this in spite of asymmetric synthesis being now a mature concept and field. Why should enantioselective C&#8722;N bond formation be so difficult? This question and some of the first examples that promise an imminent change of paradigm are herein discussed.
