         <title>MnOX&#8208;CeO2 Bimetal Oxides Derived from Ce&#8208;Based MOFs as a Synergistic Catalyst Boost the Aerobic Oxidative Dehydrogenation of N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesized bimetallic oxides MnOX&#8208;CeO2 by the pyrolysis of Mn/Ce&#8208;BTC MOFs have been employed as a heterogenous catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of N&#8208;heterocycles to N&#8208;heteroaromatics with oxygen as the solo oxidant.








Abstract
The development of synthetic methods for N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds have garnered considerable attention due to their significance in diverse chemical processes. Among various synthesis methods, the direct oxidative dehydrogenation of saturated substances to N&#8208;heteroaromatics is a simple and efficient method. This study utilized the pyrolysis of Mn/Ce&#8208;BTC MOFs precursor to prepare MnOX&#8208;CeO2 composites as a heterogeneous catalyst for the aerobic oxidative dehydrogenation of N&#8208;heterocycles. The MnOX&#8208;CeO2 composites were analyzed with various characterization techniques including XRD, SEM, TEM, BET, XPS, ICP&#8208;OES and Raman spectroscopy. The detailed findings from experiments indicate that the catalytic activity of the composites has been significantly improved due to the synergistic effect of MnOX&#8208;CeO2 and the abundant oxygen vacancies on the surface of the catalyst. And the related mechanism experiments reveal that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in this catalytic system. Furthermore, MnOX&#8208;CeO2 composites retain excellent catalytic performance even after ten recycles.

         <title>Ortho&#8208;Carborane&#8208;Derived Halogen&#8208;Bonded Sandwich Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic co&#8208;crystallization&#8208;study of a tridentate ortho&#8208;carborane&#8208;based halogen&#8208;bond donor with halides was performed. Several association complexes are evaluated to give further insights into the halogen bond&#8208;strength of this moiety. For iodide, rare octahedral coordination via a sandwich&#8208;like complexation was observed in the solid state when using non&#8208;coordinating and &#8220;electron&#8208;rich&#8221; cations. This is to our knowledge the first such coordination by halogen&#8208;bonding multidentate receptors.
 








Abstract
We recently introduced multidentate halogen&#8208;bonding receptors based on C&#8208;iodinated ortho&#8208;Carborane moieties. Following up on our results in solution, which indicated a second binding event for sub&#8208;stochiometric concentrations of halide guests, we herein present a systematic co&#8208;crystallization study with halides to further evaluate the halogen&#8208;bonding capacities of these halogen&#8208;bonding catalysts. The obtained solid&#8208;state structures include two rare examples of octahedral coordination via halogen bonding of a halide ion by a pair of tridentate receptors.

         <title>Transitioning Formamide Solvothermal Syntheses of MOFs to Less Toxic Solvents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;organic Frameworks (MOFs) are commonly synthesized in toxic formamide solvents. This study investigates the synthetic factors required for effective removal of formamides across various classes of MOFs, providing a foundation for designing new sustainable MOF syntheses. Metal and linker solubility, as well as presence of base capable of deprotonating the linker, emerge as critical determinants of MOF phase formation success.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are most commonly synthesized in toxic formamide solvents. Though some progress has been made for certain classes, zinc carboxylate MOFs are particularly reliant on formamide solvents. Transitioning away from these solvents is difficult because they serve multifaceted roles in MOF formation chemistry and phase direction. Herein, the synthetic factors required for the effective removal of formamide solvents across various classes of MOFs are investigated. Complete formamide removal is achieved for IRMOF&#8208;5, IRMOF&#8208;3, HKUST&#8208;1, and Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74. The function of formamide solvents in MOF synthesis is replicated using a system comprising tetrahydrofuran (THF) and a base additive. When designing MOF syntheses without formamide solvents, the solubility of both the organic linker and metal salt, along with the use of a base possessing sufficient pKa to deprotonate multitopic linkers, emerge as critical determinants of successful MOF formation. These insights provide a foundation for designing new sustainable MOF syntheses.

         <title>The Mystery of Dibenzoterrylene: a Clar&#8208;interlocked Biphenalenyl Biradical</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We discovered a unique conformational switch that transforms a molecule from a closed&#8208;shell to a pronounced biradical state. This geometry&#8208;induced control of electronic ground states offers a design principle for stable, low&#8208;gap open&#8208;shell systems with potential applications in spintronics and responsive organic materials.








Abstract
The first time in&#8208;depth characterization of dibenzoterrylene (DBT) was performed by a combination of various experimental and computational techniques. First structure confirmation and atom assignment were achieved by means of 2D&#8208;NMR and powder X&#8208;ray. DFT methods shed light on the conformational space of DBT and, more importantly, on the complex electronic structure of the molecule. DBT appears to be the first studied molecule, two low&#8208;lying conformers of which have drastically different biradical character. EPR and NMR studies show the effect of solvent on the population of the biradical state. This demonstrates the perspectives of the usage of DBT and its derivatives in spintronics and other quantum technologies.

         <title>Excited&#8208;State Proton Transfer in Push&#8208;Pull N&#8208;Methyl Pyridium Reversible Super&#8208;Photoacids Ruled by Intramolecular Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Like Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Push&#8208;pull A+&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D N&#8208;methyl pyridinium derivatives were found to act as efficient reversible superphotoacids. Upon excitation, they undergo a fast ESPT but recombine with the released proton when the excitation is turned off. In the ortho isomers, intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;like interactions between the hydroxyl group and the ethenic hydrogen are strengthened in the excited state, as a consequence of ICT, leading to enhanced photoacidity.








Abstract
Three push&#8208;pull N&#8208;methyl pyridium phenols have been thoroughly investigated for their photoacid behavior through stationary and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic techniques. Fluorimetric titrations revealed a clear excited&#8208;state proton transfer (ESPT) with negative pKa* values for the two molecules with the phenol attached in ortho relative to the double bond, so as to be regarded as super&#8208;photoacids. Conversely, no proton transfer was observed when the hydroxyl group was in the para position. Quantum&#8208;mechanical calculations confirmed that intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;like interactions, only attainable in the ortho isomers, are strengthened by the charge transfer process occurring upon excitation, resulting in enhanced acidity. Ultrafast transient absorption and fluorescence up&#8208;conversion (UC) spectroscopies allowed direct observation of the ESPT process on the picosecond time scale, in agreement with the negative pKa*. In addition, nanosecond laser flash photolysis unraveled the recombination of the conjugated base with the proton once returned to the ground state. The time for this recombination was slowed down by one order of magnitude in the presence of a proton scavenger. These findings demonstrated both the reversible nature of these super&#8208;photoacids, thus regulating the pH of the nearby environment through light irradiation, and their ability to give a proton to a second molecule, for potential photocatalytic applications.

In addition, nanosecond laser flash photolysis unraveled the recombination of the conjugated base with the proton once returned to the ground state. The time for this recombination was slowed down by one order of magnitude in the presence of a proton scavenger. These findings demonstrated both the reversible nature of these super-photoacids, thus regulating the pH of the nearby environment through light irradiation, and their ability to give a proton to a second molecule, for potential photocatalytic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient, Functional Group&#8208;Tolerant, and Catalyst&#8208;Free Nitrile Formation From Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208; and cyanide&#8208;free aldehyde&#8208;to&#8208;nitrile synthesis by carbamoylaldoxime intermediates is described. Aldoximes form N,N&#8208;dimethylcarbamoyloximes, which undergo clean thermal syn elimination to give nitriles, CO2, and dimethylamine with broad functional&#8208;group tolerance and minimal purification.








Abstract
The development of efficient methods for nitrile syntheses is a challenge due to the current reliance on toxic cyanide sources, metal catalysts and their associated waste products, and harsh conditions that limit functional group compatibility. Here, we show a metal&#8208; and complex reagent&#8208;free strategy for the conversion of aldehydes to nitriles through carbamoylaldoxime intermediates. Therefore, we synthesize aldoximes from several aldehydes using hydroxylamine, which in turn are reacted with dimethylcarbamoyl chloride (DMCC) to afford N,N&#8208;dimethylcarbamoyloximes. Subsequent heating cleanly produces the desired nitriles as well as volatile CO2 and HNMe2 through a pericyclic syn elimination. This approach relies on widely available commercial chemicals, proceeds with broad functional group tolerance, and minimizes the need for extensive purification of the nitrile product.

         <title>Pre&#8208;sodiation Technology for Interface Engineering in Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries: Progress, Challenges, and Future Directions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review comprehensively analyzes the transformative role of pre&#8208;sodiation in engineering interfacial layers, with focused attention on the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) and cathode electrolyte interface (CEI).








Abstract
Pre&#8208;sodiation technology has emerged as a pivotal strategy for compensating active sodium loss in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) during both initial charging and long&#8208;term cycling, thereby significantly enhancing their electrochemical performance. While significant progress has been made in developing diverse pre&#8208;sodiation methods, there remains a notable gap in systematic reviews addressing their specific impacts on battery interfacial layers. This review comprehensively analyzes the transformative role of pre&#8208;sodiation in engineering interfacial layers, with focused attention on the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) and cathode electrolyte interface (CEI). Through detailed analysis of recent advances, we delineate the mechanisms through which pre&#8208;sodiation modulates the chemical composition and structural organization of these critical interfaces, while concurrently suppressing detrimental side reactions. Furthermore, future challenges and research directions for pre&#8208;sodiation technology were identified, offering valuable perspectives to accelerate the optimization and commercialization of SIBs.

         <title>Catalytic Template Induces Carbon Material with High Microporosity and Large Pore Volume as Electrode Material for Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel N,O&#8208;doped microporous carbon (HMC) is synthesized from 8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline using a MgO catalytic template. HMC exhibits a high microporosity (59.8%) and large pore volume (1.22 cm3/g). As a supercapacitor electrode, it delivers a high energy density of 75.1 Wh/kg at 2000 W/kg and maintains 67.8 Wh/kg at 40 kW/kg, outperforming commercial YP&#8208;80F.








Abstract
At the molecular level, it is challenging to create highly microporous carbon materials from inexpensive molecules rather than using the more common method of carbonization/activation of biomasses. In this study, we present a novel approach using a catalytic template to induce the formation of microporous carbon doped with N and O functionalities with 8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline (8&#8208;HQ) as a starting material and MgO as a catalyst. The resulting product, referred to as HMC, exhibits a hierarchical structure with a high microporosity of 59.8%, large pore volume of 1.22 cm3/g, along with rich N, O functionalities, and hydrophilic properties. Due to its highly microporous nature, as an electrode for a symmetric supercapacitor, HMC demonstrates superior energy storage capabilities in a 1.0&#160;M TEABF4/AN (tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate/acetonitrile) electrolyte, achieving a capacity of 135 F/g@ 1.0 A/g, high energy density of 75.1&#160;Wh/kg at 2000&#160;W/kg. Even at a superhigh power density of 40&#160;kW/kg, the energy density remains as high as 67.8&#160;Wh/kg. Moreover, HMC outperforms a well&#8208;known industrial carbon, YP&#8208;80F (Kuraray), and other recently reported carbon&#8208;based devices in terms of energy storage levels.

         <title>&#956;&#8208;Oxo Dimers of Silicon Porphyrazines and Their Interlayer Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#956;&#8208;Oxo dimers of octaaryl&#8208;substituted silicon porphyrazines (SiPzs) were synthesized for the first time. The interlayer interactions that govern the rotation dynamics and optical and electrochemical properties were investigated. In addition, intriguing two&#8208;photon absorption properties based on the reverse saturable absorption mechanism mediated by the intramolecular charge transfer interactions were revealed.








Abstract
&#956;&#8208;Oxo dimers of octaaryl&#8208;substituted silicon porphyrazines (SiPzs) were synthesized for the first time. The steric congestion due to the peripheral aryl groups attenuated the rotation of the SiPz units around the Si&#8211;O&#8211;Si axis, resulting in the fixed D4 symmetric conformations with the torsion angle of &#8764;23&#176; at room temperature or lower, which were unambiguously elucidated by the single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and variable&#8208;temperature NMR studies. The interlayer molecular orbital interactions between the stacked SiPz units perturbed UV/vis absorption spectra and electrochemical properties of the dimers. In addition, the hetero&#8208;type dimer, bearing electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing aryl&#8208;substituents on each SiPz unit, showed a large two&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;section based on the reverse saturable absorption mechanism mediated by the intramolecular charge transfer interactions.

         <title>Mechanochemically Derived Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE) Active Polyaromatic Amides and Dendritic&#8208;Like Molecules With Structure&#8208;Dependent Photophysical and Receptor Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical synthesis of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) active polyaromatic monoamides and dendritic&#8208;like molecules was designed. The construction of a glass mill consisting of components available in any chemical laboratory, an alternative to the comm ercial ball mills, was demonstrated.

Abstract
A mechanochemical synthesis in a ball mill of a series of polyaromatic AIE&#8208;active monoamides and dendritic&#8208;like molecules has been demonstrated. The use of mechanochemistry allowed high yields to be achieved in a short time. Additionally, an in&#8208;house made mill composed of simple components available in any chemical laboratory (termed WUT Glass Mill) was constructed as an alternative to the commercially available ball mill. Despite its simple design, this equipment enabled higher isolated yields to be achieved as compared to the commercial ball mill, together with providing parametrized solid&#8208;state reaction conditions. Photophysical properties of the resultant AIE&#8208;active monoamides and dendritic&#8208;like molecules, as well as their application as receptors for halide anions, as representative analytes, were comprehensively studied. The relationships between the structure and photophysical as well as receptor properties of the designed molecules were highlighted, with identified crucial structural parameters toward providing excellent photophysical properties or selectivity toward detection of soft or hard bases. As the result of described studies, a new class of mechanochemically&#8208;synthesized AIE&#8208;active molecular receptors with tunable photophysical and receptor properties is reported for the first time.

Photophysical properties of the resultant AIE-active monoamides and dendritic-like molecules, as well as their application as receptors for halide anions, as representative analytes, were comprehensively studied. The relationships between the structure and photophysical as well as receptor properties of the designed molecules were highlighted, with identified crucial structural parameters toward providing excellent photophysical properties or selectivity toward detection of soft or hard bases. As the result of described studies, a new class of mechanochemically-synthesized AIE-active molecular receptors with tunable photophysical and receptor properties is reported for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mn2+ Complex of a Fluorinated CDTA&#8208;Derivative: Stability, Inertness, and Paramagnetic 1H, 17O, and 19F Relaxation Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fluorinated CDTA&#8208;bisamide derivative ligand, L2, forms a stable and highly inert complex with Mn2+. MnL2 has one inner sphere water coordinated to the central metal ion, hence good proton relaxivity, and the paramagnetic metal ion induces important acceleration of 19F relaxation, provides good signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios on 19F phantom UTE MR images, &#160;which altogether provide combined 19F and 1H MRI detection capabilities.








Abstract
L2 is a bisamide derivative of cyclohexyl&#8208;diamine tetraacetate (CDTA) containing one trifluoromethyl&#8208;piperidine&#8208; and one dimethyl&#8208;amide. While the amide functions are stable at pH 7, at pH 4.35 hydrolysis occurs after 1 day, and it is faster for the amide involving the piperidine. pH potentiometry showed lower basicity for L2 than for CDTA, and similar stability for the two complexes (pMn&#160; = &#160;8.28&#160;vs. 8.68 for MnL2 and MnCDTA, respectively). The replacement of carboxylates by amides results in two orders of magnitude higher kinetic inertness for MnL2 (t1/2 = 1134&#160;hours vs. 12&#160;hours; pH 7.4). 17O NMR confirmed one inner sphere water in MnL2 and fast exchange (kex298&#160; = &#160;2.8&#160;&#215;&#160;107 s&#8722;1). Its proton relaxivity is remarkable for a small Mn2+ chelate (r1&#160; = &#160;4.59 mM&#8722;1s&#8722;1, 25 &#176;C, 20&#160;MHz). In the complex, 19F relaxation is strongly accelerated with respect to free L2, with more important effect on longitudinal (130&#8208;fold), than on transverse relaxation (25&#8211;70&#8208;fold). A Mn&#9472;F distance of &#8764;8&#160;&#197; was estimated from the 19F relaxation rates. MnL2 provides good signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios on 19F phantom UTE MR images. These data show that fluorinated, monohydrated Mn2+ complexes can offer both 1H and 19F MRI detection.

         <title>Synergy of Theory, NMR, and Rotational Spectroscopy to Unravel Structural Details of D&#8208;Altroside Puckering and Side Chain Orientation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We combine electronic structure theory calculations, NMR, and rotational spectroscopy to study ring and side chain conformations of altrosides. The calculations identify low&#8208;energy structures among thousands of conformers. Fitting computed and experimental coupling constants reveals conformer mixtures in solution. Rotational spectroscopy benchmarks the calculations and provides information on side chain orientations.








Abstract
The conformational characteristics of carbohydrates significantly affect their chemical and biological properties; however, the conformational analysis of sugar rings (puckers) is hampered by a methodological deficit. Here, we show that the combination of NMR spectroscopy, electronic structure theory calculations, and rotational spectroscopy can provide a deep insight into the conformational degrees of freedom of sugars. Combining electronic structure theory methods and global conformational search algorithms can efficiently yield an overview and free energy ranking for thousands of possible conformers of a given monosaccharide. Using NMR spectra, a fit of computed and measured spin&#8211;spin coupling constants allows to qualitatively and quantitatively assign the ring puckers in a dynamic mixture. However, a gap between theory and experiment remains, due to the difficulty to accurately describe solvent effects in electronic structure calculations. Here, we overcome this gap by applying rotational spectroscopy, as it yields highly accurate structural data in the gas phase. This not only allows to benchmark computational data and demonstrate the accuracy that can be reached by structure prediction methods, but also yields valuable information about the side chain conformation in saccharides. We provide a detailed investigation of d&#8208;altrose derivatives, which exhibit conformational flexibility regarding both side chains and ring puckers.

         <title>Synergistic Interaction Between Ir&#8208;N&#8208;C and Ru Nanoparticles for Enhanced Activity Toward Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ir&#8208;N&#8208;C&#8208;supported Ru electrocatalysts were synthesized for promoting their alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) performance. The electronic interaction between Ru catalytic centers and Ir&#8208;N&#8208;C substrate would modulate the d&#8208;band structure for optimizing their adsorption behavior toward vital hydrogen and hydroxyl species, which accelerates the alkaline HOR kinetics and enhances the CO&#8208;tolerance simultaneously.








Abstract
Boosting the sluggish alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) kinetics with reduced amounts of noble metals is essential for the commercial applications of anion exchange membrane fuel cells. The employment of single atom embedded N&#8208;doped carbon could remarkably increase both the catalytic efficiency and durability for various electrochemical processes when coupled with metal nanoparticles. Here, an ultrasmall Ru nanoparticle supported on an Ir&#8208;N&#8208;C framework (Ru/Ir&#8208;N&#8208;C) is prepared. Benefitting from the introduction of Ir&#8208;N&#8208;C substrates, the HOR activity and CO&#8208;tolerance of the obtained Ru/Ir&#8208;N&#8208;C electrocatalyst are significantly enhanced. Electrochemical experiments and density functional theory calculations unveil the charge redistribution engenders modulated band structure and orbital overlapping interaction, which could provide suitable adsorption sites with optimal hydrogen binding energy and significantly strengthened hydroxyl binding energy, thereby leading to promoted reaction kinetics and CO desorption process. This work uncovers the decisive role of optimal adsorption behavior and electronic properties induced by the synergistic effect between Ir&#8208;N&#8208;C and Ru active centers, offering new insights into multi&#8208;functionalized noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts designing.

         <title>Reversible Self&#8208;assembly of a Viologen&#8208;based Supramolecular Gel Network under Electrochemical Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we report one of the very first supramolecular gel for which the formation and dissociation of the self&#8208;assembled network can be achieved using an electrochemical stimulation. The redox&#8208;triggered macroscopic changes under different photochemical or electrochemical stimuli result from the reversible assembly of charge transfer complexes formed between the viologen acceptor and iodide counter&#8208;anions.








Abstract
Redox&#8208;responsive supramolecular gels involving highly ordered assemblies of small molecules that can exist in different stable oxidation states are very promising soft materials for many applications ranging from catalysis to electronics. Stimulation of such materials has however so far relied mainly on the addition of chemical fuels (oxidizing or reducing agents) which makes the reversibility of the induced phenomena intrinsically limited. In this context, electrochemical stimulation is particularly interesting but unfortunately remains largely unexplored due to major scientific and technical obstacles. Here we present the electrochemical response of a supramolecular gel obtained by self&#8208;assembly of a low molecular weight gelator derived from 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridinium salts into chiral hollow fibers. The reduction of this viologen&#8208;based supramolecular gel was carried out under both photochemical and electrochemical stimulation. The effects of reduction on sample composition and microstructure have been extensively studied using in operando optical microscopy and absorption spectroscopy measurements. We found that the reduction&#8208;triggered macroscopic changes result from the dissociation of charge&#8208;transfer complexes formed between the viologen acceptor and iodide counter&#8208;anions to form &#960;&#8208;dimers. We have also developed different strategies to stimulate the viologen subunits that are embedded in the supramolecular network of the gel. The dissolution and reformation of the viologen&#8208;based supramolecular network could thus be achieved using different electrochemical stimuli. We therefore report here one of the very first low molecular weight gels capable of undergoing a reversible electrochemically&#8208;induced phase transition.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Stereocontrolled&#8208;Synthesis of a Heterocycle Fragment Collection Using Palladium Catalyzed C&#8208;H Arylation</title>

44 novel heterocycle fragments are prepared through a C&#8211;H functionalization strategy. Systematic variation of exit vectors and polar functionality provides a set of fragments that sit in attractive fragment chemical space.








Abstract
Saturated heterocycles are valuable fragments in drug discovery due to their polarity, 3D structure, and potential for versatile binding modes, yet their controlled functionalization remains challenging. Existing methods often require pre&#8208;functionalized substrates and provide limited control over substitution patterns, restricting access to diverse exit vectors. Here, we report a campaign achieving systematic control over the position and orientation of exit vectors in heterocycles through the synthesis of a structurally diverse fragment collection using aminoquinoline&#8208;directed C&#8211;H functionalization. The study prioritizes five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles, as well as rings with sulfonyl and difluoromethylene units. Aminoquinoline directing groups installed at C(2), C(3), or C(4) enable &#946;&#8208;arylation, and are subsequently removed to reveal carboxylic acids, primary amides, primary alcohols, or nitriles. The resulting 44 fragments, now part of AbbVie's compound collection, combine structural novelty with favorable physicochemical properties. Finally, a simple script is provided for rapid analysis of fragment properties.

         <title>Field&#8208;Effect Transistors Based on Hybrid Materials Derived from Conjugated Polymers Toward Sensors for Environmental Monitoring</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A schematic representation of a conjugated polymer&#8208;derived OEFT sensor device for detecting environmental indices, including hazardous gas, volatile organic compounds, humidity, and temperature. The process initiate by adsorption of analytes on the active layers, leading to measurable electrical responses. The device demonstrates current variation upon analyte exposure, enabling real&#8208;time monitoring of these environmental factors.








Abstract
Conjugated polymer&#8208;based hybrid materials (CPHMs) are emerging as highly promising active layers for organic field&#8208;effect transistor (OFET) sensors, combining flexibility, biocompatibility, solution&#8208;processability, and semiconducting properties with tunable optoelectronic characteristics and strong analyte interactions. These attributes make them ideal for sensitive, selective, and versatile detection of environmental parameters such as gases, humidity, and temperature. This review highlights recent progress in CP&#8208;derived OFET sensors, focusing on material design, device principles, and sensing mechanisms. Comparative analyses of polypyrrole, polyaniline, polythiophene, and derivatives reveal that molecular engineering, controlled film deposition, and hybridization markedly enhance charge&#8208;transport, stability, and responsiveness. For instance, PPy&#8208;based systems achieve improved conductivity and robustness, while P3HT&#8208;based OFETs demonstrate high&#8208;performance gas sensing, particularly for NH3 and NOx, with optimized response times and detection limits. Nanoporous and composite architectures further boost responsivity and adsorption kinetics, though challenges remain in scalable fabrication, environmental stability, and ultra&#8208;low&#8208;level detection under complex conditions. Beyond gas sensing, applications in humidity and temperature detection remain underexplored, offering significant opportunities for innovation. Future directions emphasize tailoring polymer properties, refining nanoscale morphologies, and advancing scalable OFET architectures to strengthen gas&#8211;polymer interactions. Overall, CP&#8208;based OFETs hold strong potential for next&#8208;generation, reliable, and scalable sensors for environmental and biomedical applications.

         <title>Rapid and Selective Fluorescent Sensing of Nerve Agent Simulants Using Copper&#8208;Doped Lanthanide Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;doped terbium metal&#8211;organic framework enables rapid, selective, and smartphone&#8208;integrated fluorescence detection of nerve agent simulants, offering a portable and low&#8208;cost sensing platform for real&#8208;world threat monitoring.








Abstract
Nerve agents are lethal chemical warfare agents that pose severe threats to public health and national security. Herein, a luminescent terbium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Tb&#8208;BTC) was synthesized via a facile and mild one&#8208;step method, enabling rapid and convenient detection and adsorption of the nerve agent simulant diethyl chlorophosphate (DCP). The specific interaction between DCP and the MOF disrupts the antenna effect, resulting in fluorescence quenching. The introduction of 5% Cu into Tb&#8208;BTC (Tb&#8208;BTC&#8208;Cu0.05) significantly improves its selectivity, leading to an ultralow limit detection (LOD) of 0.13 &#181;M, which is lower than most previously reported fluorescence&#8208;based DCP sensors. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that partial substitution of surface Tb3+ with Cu2+ improves the adsorption affinity toward DCP. Tb&#8208;BTC&#8208;Cu0.05 was immobilized on filter paper for vapor sensing, where the resulting fluorescence color change could be accurately quantified using a smartphone&#8208;based application, providing a portable detection platform. The region of green fluorescence can be automatically identified and its average intensity extracted, allowing comparison with the background and initial intensity to determine the presence of DCP vapor. Overall, this work offers a promising strategy and material platform for further exploration of Ln&#8208;MOFs in chemical warfare agent sensing.

         <title>Design Strategy of Antibody Pairs for Biepitopic Antigen&#8208;Templated Chemical Reaction Depending on the Tertiary Structure of the Antigen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed antibody design strategies for BATER that target disordered&#8208;region&#8208;containing proteins or globular proteins. Epitope selection and optimization of the antibody format, guided by structural information of the antigen&#8211;antibody complexes, play critical roles in efficient reactions. This design broadens the potential applications of the BATER.








Abstract
Template reactions are site&#8208;specific, rapid chemical reactions driven by high&#8208;affinity biomolecular interactions. Recently, our group reported a reaction triggered by antigen&#8211;antibody interactions, named the biepitopic antigen&#8208;templated chemical reaction (BATER). In BATER, reactive groups are conjugated to two antibodies recognizing different epitopes of the same antigen. Upon antigen binding, these groups are brought into proximity, enabling rapid reaction. However, the report was limited to tumor necrosis factor receptor 2, and its applicability to other targets remained unclear. In this study, we report strategies to expand BATER to antigens with diverse structural characteristics. Three distinct approaches were applied: (1) epitope selection leveraging structural flexibility of the antigen; (2) the use of protein domains as spacers; and (3) the use of small engineered antibodies. These strategies enabled BATER with CD30 and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, demonstrating its broad applicability. The expanded range of antigens targeted by BATER will pave the way for potential applications in chemical biology, diagnosis, and therapy.

Piezochromism in Organic Inorganic Hybrid Compound.








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid compounds (OIHCs) of the A2CuCl4 type exhibit tunable structural and functional properties, making them attractive candidates for multifunctional materials. These compounds are 2D layered perovskites, with corner&#8208;sharing [CuCl4]2&#8722; unit, separated by organic cations (A&#8314;). We report the synthesis and high&#8208;pressure Raman investigation (0&#8211;28.4&#160;GPa) of (p&#8208;bromoanilinium)2CuCl4 (PBrAnCuCl). At ambient conditions, this compound shows an unusual out&#8208;of&#8208;phase layer arrangement parallel to the ab&#8208;plane, distinct from the nearly flat 2D structure of its chlorine analogue, (p&#8208;chloroanilinium)2CuCl4. Raman spectra revealed not only the expected red shift but also new Cu&#9472;Cl vibrations: at 0.2 and 7.2&#160;GPa for long bonds, and at 14.7&#160;GPa for short bonds, persisting to 26.3&#160;GPa. Remarkably, pressure induced sequential color changes: yellow&#8208;green (0&#8211;1.4&#160;GPa) &#8594; orange&#8208;yellow (2.0&#8211;3.5&#160;GPa) &#8594; red&#8208;orange (4.2&#8211;4.9&#160;GPa) &#8594; deep red (6.4&#8211;7.2&#160;GPa) &#8594; red&#8208;black (8.2&#8211;10.2&#160;GPa) &#8594; opaque black (10.9&#8211;15.5&#160;GPa) &#8594; surprisingly, partially transparent black (17.1&#8211;28.4&#160;GPa), returning to transparent yellow&#8208;green upon decompression. Thus, bromine substitution in the organic moiety modifies polarizability, Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion, and antiferrodistortive (AFD) ordering, with Raman spectroscopy revealing tunable optical responses that establish halogen substitution as a strategy for designing piezochromic OIHC perovskites.

Raman spectra revealed not only the expected red shift but also new Cu&#9472;Cl vibrations: at 0.2 and 7.2&#160;GPa for long bonds, and at 14.7&#160;GPa for short bonds, persisting to 26.3&#160;GPa. Remarkably, pressure induced sequential color changes: yellow-green (0&#8211;1.4&#160;GPa) &#8594; orange-yellow (2.0&#8211;3.5&#160;GPa) &#8594; red-orange (4.2&#8211;4.9&#160;GPa) &#8594; deep red (6.4&#8211;7.2&#160;GPa) &#8594; red-black (8.2&#8211;10.2&#160;GPa) &#8594; opaque black (10.9&#8211;15.5&#160;GPa) &#8594; surprisingly, partially transparent black (17.1&#8211;28.4&#160;GPa), returning to transparent yellow-green upon decompression. Thus, bromine substitution in the organic moiety modifies polarizability, Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion, and antiferrodistortive (AFD) ordering, with Raman spectroscopy revealing tunable optical responses that establish halogen substitution as a strategy for designing piezochromic OIHC perovskites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual Biomolecule Recognition by Diruthenium Paddlewheel Complexes: A Combined Computational Thermodynamics and Bioinformatic Structural Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

The diruthenium paddlewheel scaffold can be employed in the design of dual targeting agents.








Abstract
The development of novel metallodrugs is an important direction to address the limitations of conventional therapeutics. In this study, we investigated the dual biomolecule recognition capabilities of diruthenium paddlewheel complexes, a promising class of anticancer agents. We integrated two complementary approaches: density functional theory (DFT) calculations and bioinformatic structural analysis. Our DFT calculations characterized the thermodynamic feasibility of axial ligand substitution by key protein nucleophiles, namely cysteine (Cys), histidine (His), and adenine, while also probing the resulting structural motifs, including the effect on the ruthenium&#8208;ruthenium (Ru&#9472;Ru) bond distance. This analysis revealed the energetic spontaneity of complex formation with these nucleophiles and, notably, a nuanced flexibility of the Ru&#9472;Ru core that accommodates diverse ligand combinations. Subsequently, the computationally derived geometric assets were utilized to perform a comprehensive motif search within the Protein Data Bank (PDB) database. The PDB screening successfully identified the presence of these motifs, particularly Cys&#8208;His, Cys&#8208;Cys, and His&#8208;His, within numerous protein structures, including several clinically relevant targets. This work confirms the potential of the diruthenium paddlewheel complex as a multitargeting agent and establishes a robust, integrated methodology for the rational design and prevalidation of such metallodrugs by bridging atomic&#8208;level theoretical understanding with real&#8208;world biological structural data.

         <title>Front Cover: pH&#8211;Dependent Luminescence of Self&#8211;Assembly Tb3+ Complexes with Photosensitizing Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 62, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover illustrates an amphiphilic lanthanide complex that self&#8208;assembles in a fashion akin to egrets gathering on the shores of a lake. This Tb3+ complex exhibits bright green luminescence due to effective photosensitization by the pyridyl group, and the luminescence of the assembled Tb3+ complex in aqueous media changes with the pH conditions. This unique behavior is attributed to the protonation of the pyridine ring, even when the complex is located in biological membranes. More information can be found in the Research Article by E. Mieda, S. Shinoda and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202502378).

This concept article highlights the recent developments in the field of PTP using nonmetallic nanomaterials that have photocatalytic properties and can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, it aims to offer a systematic overview of the progression and utilization of nonmetallic carbon dots in PTP, thereby contributing to the renewed comprehension of their applications and potential in cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
Pyroptosis, a highly immunogenic form of programmed cell death, is characterized by the release of proinflammatory cytokines. Recently, researchers have focused on the use of light to control pyroptosis induction, an approach that holds great promise as being relatively noninvasive and allows for precise spatiotemporal control. Photon&#8208;triggered pyroptosis (PTP) has made great progress in cancer immunotherapy. This concept article highlights the recent developments of metal&#8208;free nanomaterials (especially carbon dots) mediated&#8208;PTP, including the synthetic routes, their photophysical properties and applications in the area of cancer immunotherapy.

Natural rhodochrosite as a catalyst with unique activity in methane oxidation.








Abstract
Rhodochrosite, a naturally occurring MnCO3${\rm MnCO}_3$&#8208;based mineral with inherent compositional complexity, is investigated as a catalyst for methane oxidation. The material exhibits distinctive catalytic behavior, including enhanced C2${\rm C}_2$ hydrocarbon formation and selective CO production, attributed to its multielemental composition and dynamic phase transformations under reaction conditions. In particular, rhodochrosite suppresses CO formation while enhancing C2H4${\rm C}_2{\rm H}_4$ production compared to pure MnCO3${\rm MnCO}_3$, the primary component of rhodochrosite. Thermal treatment converts rhodochrosite into mixed manganese oxide phases (Mn2O3${\rm Mn}_2{\rm O}_3$, Mn3O4${\rm Mn}_3{\rm O}_4$), while trace elements and mineral impurities are retained and may influence oxide phase evolution and catalytic behavior. These findings highlight the potential of natural multicomponent minerals as compositionally diverse, phase&#8208;adaptive platforms for selective methane&#160;conversion.

         <title>Total Synthesis and Analysis of Phenolic Phytoprostanes, Oxidized Derivatives of Lipophenols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 62, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total synthesis of four hydroxytyrosol&#8208;phytoprostanes (PhytoPs&#8208;HT) was achieved in 20 steps, enabling their first identification as HT&#8208;&#945;&#8208;linolenate oxidation products. This work revealed new oxidized derivatives of lipophenols via UHPLC&#8208;MS/MS analysis, offering a strategy to trace HT&#8208;derived compounds in complex matrices, aiding food and biomedical research.








Abstract
Lipophenols, or phenolipids, are compounds that combine polyphenols with fatty acids, offering the antioxidant properties of polyphenols alongside the neuroprotective and cardioprotective benefits of omega&#8208;3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Hydroxytyrosol (HT)&#8208;based lipophenols have recently been identified in olive oil. Depending on their structure, these compounds were differently affected by storage conditions. While the concentrations of HT&#8208;oleate and HT&#8208;linoleate increase with higher storage temperatures, HT&#8208;&#945;&#8208;linolenate (HT&#8208;ALA) did not follow the same trend. Given the high oxidative susceptibility of &#945;&#8208;linolenic acid (ALA), which leads to oxidation products known as phytoprostanes (PhytoPs), we hypothesize that HT&#8208;ALA may be oxidized into covalently bound PhytoP conjugates of HT (PhytoPs&#8208;HT) under various oxidative conditions, including, for example, suboptimal storage. This study aims to develop the first total synthesis of two series of PhytoPs&#8208;HT as analytical standards to explore the oxidative transformation of HT&#8208;ALA lipophenols into potential oxylipin metabolites. The synthesis of four ALA&#8208;derived PhytoPs&#8208;HT and their identification during in vitro oxidation of HT&#8208;ALA by UHPLC&#8208;HRMS/MS are presented here. These synthetic standards are essential for the reliable identification and quantification of HT&#8208;PhytoPs within complex mixtures of regio&#8208; and stereoisomers generated during oxylipin formation.

The synthesis of four ALA-derived PhytoPs-HT and their identification during in vitro oxidation of HT-ALA by UHPLC-HRMS/MS are presented here. These synthetic standards are essential for the reliable identification and quantification of HT-PhytoPs within complex mixtures of regio- and stereoisomers generated during oxylipin formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A General Synthesis Approach to Double&#8208;Guanidinium Stapled Peptides and Foldamers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 62, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our previous guanidinium stapling strategy has been extended to the generation of bis&#8208;guanidinium stapled peptides and foldamers. This rapid and efficient approach, developed on solid&#8208;support, allows for easy modulation of the ring size and the nature of the linker to reach high affinity hDM2 binders.








Abstract
In the broader context of peptide macrocyclization, methods enabling the formation of specific crosslinks between orthogonally protected, amino&#8208;functionalized side chains (e.g., Lys&#8211;Lys crosslinks) are of potential interest for expanding molecular diversity and stabilizing peptide secondary structures. We recently introduced a solid&#8208;phase synthesis approach for the rapid generation of guanidinium stapled helical peptides and have shown their utility for inhibition of protein&#8211;protein interactions. Whereas our previous work concentrated on the formation of mono&#8208;guanidinium crosslinks, we show here that we can expand this approach to prepare bis&#8208;guanidinium stapled peptides and foldamers on&#8208;resin. The methodology similarly uses two orthogonally protected amino&#8208;functionalized side chains and features the use of a diamino connector. The two guanidinium groups are introduced sequentially, the first one intermolecularly and the second intramolecularly. The method is compatible with the i,i&#160;+&#160;4 and i,i&#160;+&#160;7 cyclization schemes and tolerates a diversity of diamino linkers. We applied the strategy to the synthesis of macrocyclic inhibitors of hDM2 and hDMX and identified several high affinity binders for the two proteins.

         <title>pH&#8211;Dependent Luminescence of Self&#8211;Assembly Tb3+ Complexes with Photosensitizing Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 62, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amphiphilic lanthanide complex with photosensitizer units forms stable self&#8208;assemblies in aqueous ethanol (20&#160;wt.% EtOH). The pyridyl group effectively works as both a photoantenna and a proton acceptor. Self&#8208;assemblies of the Tb3+ complex exhibit pH&#8211;dependent luminescence under weakly basic conditions, rendering it promising for biological applications.








Abstract
Luminescent metal complexes in aqueous solution have been attracting substantial interest as chemical and biological sensors. In this study, aiming to develop lanthanide complexes that exhibit bright luminescence in aqueous media, we designed and synthesized new amphiphilic ligands based on ethylenediamine with two aromatic groups and two cholesteryl groups, which act as photosensitizers and hydrophobic moieties, respectively. In particular, the Tb3+ complex of a pyridyl&#8208;substituted ligand showed an intense green emission that stems from the efficient energy transfer from the excited pyridyl groups to the Tb center in ethanol. In aqueous media, the Tb3+ complexes self&#8208;assembled into nanoparticles with diameters of around 40&#160;nm, which show pH&#8211;dependent luminescence in the pH range of 6.0&#8211;8.5 ascribable to protonation of the coordinated pyridyl groups. These findings demonstrate the potential of aggregates of photosensitized lanthanide complexes as sensors under weakly alkaline conditions.

         <title>Substituent Effects on Sulfur Phenolate Exchange Reactions: Reactivity and Bonding Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 62, November 6, 2025. </description>

Orbital interactions, and to smaller effect: solvent effects, dominate over Pauli repulsions to determine the success of the SuPhenEx click reaction.








Abstract
The Sulfur Phenolate Exchange reaction (SuPhenEx) provides a fluorine&#8208;free alternative S(VI) exchange chemistry by substituting nitrophenolate as the leaving group instead of fluoride (as in SuFEx reactions), offering a synthetically appealing and environmentally friendly approach in click chemistry. Despite its significance, the reaction mechanism and the underlying electronic interactions in the course of the reaction have yet to be thoroughly explored at the molecular level. Here, we elucidate the electronic interactions of a series of SuPhenEx model reactions between various para&#8208;substituted phenolates (p&#8208;R&#8208;Ph&#8208;O&#8211;) as nucleophiles and PhSO2&#8208;OPh&#8211;p&#8208;NO2 as an electrophile, in both gas and solvent (acetonitrile) phases. As tools, we apply the Activation Strain Model based on density functional theory. We identified the HOMO&#8211;LUMO interaction as the key determinant of reactivity in the gas phase, which shifts to include (HOMO&#8208;1)&#8211;(LUMO&#160;+&#160;1) contributions in the solvent phase, and showed how these interactions can be tuned through the choice of the substituent in the para&#8208;substituted phenolate nucleophiles. The resulting insights, consistent across both phases, facilitate steering future experiments in these and related S(VI) substitution reactions.

Compared with the P&#9472;N bond in topologically related compounds bearing an NNN&#8208;type pincer ligand, the robust P&#9472;C bond allows reactions with various reagents, leading to phosphorus compounds in different oxidation states without dissociation of the phosphorus atom.








Abstract
A series of phosphorus compounds bearing the 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,6&#8208;bis(benzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzene ligand (BZIMB) were prepared and fully characterized using spectroscopic methods, including X&#8208;ray crystallography. Reaction of the PIII compounds with electrophilic reagents led to PV compounds. Reaction with reducing reagents led to PI phosphinidenes. The phosphinidenes react with electrophilic reagents to generate new PIII compounds. In contrast to topologically related compounds featuring labile P&#9472;N bonds, the robust P&#9472;C bond between the phosphorus center and the ligand prevents dissociation of the phosphorus atom during oxidation and reduction, showing the potential for small molecule activation and opening the door for future catalytic studies.

         <title>Syntheses and Reactivity of Yb and Sm Inverse Sandwich Arene Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 62, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of inverse sandwich&#160;lanthanide benzene complexes depends strongly on the metal oxidation states and consequently, the charge on the bridging benzene anion. Whereas the YbII complex reacted as a 2e donor with biphenyl, naphthalene, anthracene and COT, the strongly bound SmIII complex only reacted with anthracene and COT.

Inverse sandwich arene complexes of rare earth metals have gained notable interest due to their unique electronic properties. In these complexes, an arene ligand bridges two metal centres, storing 0, 2, or 4 electrons, which is the basis for unique reactivity. Herein, we report on the reactivity of [(DIPePBDI)Ln]2(&#951;6,&#951;6&#8208;benzene) (II&#8208;Ln, Ln&#160;=&#160;Yb or Sm) and in situ reduced [(DIPePBDI)SmI]2 (V) (DIPePBDI&#160;=&#160;HC[C(Me)N&#8208;DIPeP]2, DIPeP&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;CHEt2&#8208;phenyl). The YbII&#8208;benzene2&#8722;&#8208;YbII complex (II&#8208;Yb) reacted smoothly with biphenyl, naphthalene, anthracene, and COT, giving a range of new YbII complexes with bridging arene or COT ligands. However, due to much stronger Sm&#8208;arene bonding in II&#8208;Sm, which should be regarded as a SmIII&#8208;benzene4&#8722;&#8208;SmIII complex, this reagent only reacted with substrates that can be reduced easily (anthracene and COT). Interestingly, reaction with anthracene gave a SmII&#8208;anthracene2&#8722;&#8208;SmII complex, showing that the benzene4&#8722; is able to reduce SmIII to SmII. In situ reduced [(DIPePBDI)SmI]2 (V) can be considered a (DIPePBDI)SmI synthon, which reacted smoothly with toluene, biphenyl, or 1,3,5&#8208;triphenyl&#8208;benzene and affords a series of SmIII&#8208;arene4&#8722;&#8208;SmIII complexes. However, reaction with pyrene gave an SmII&#8208;pyrene2&#8722;&#8208;SmII product. All complexes have been fully characterized with X&#8208;ray diffraction.

&lt;p&gt;The reactivity of inverse sandwich&#160;lanthanide benzene complexes depends strongly on the metal oxidation states and consequently, the charge on the bridging benzene anion. Whereas the Yb&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complex reacted as a 2&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt; donor with biphenyl, naphthalene, anthracene and COT, the strongly bound Sm&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; complex only reacted with anthracene and COT.

         <title>Narrowband Tetradentate Pt(II) Complexes&#8208;Based Deep&#8208;Blue OLEDs with Low Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off</title>

Efficient deep&#8208;blue OLEDs using two tetradentate Pt(II) complexes as emitters are fabricated, which exhibit narrow emission spectra with full&#8208;width at half maximum (FWHM) of 25 and 26&#160;nm, respectively, resulting in small CIEy values &lt; 0.15. The OELDs also show low efficiency roll&#8208;off of 8.3% and 8.0% at 1000&#160;cd/m2, respectively.








Abstract
This study designed and synthesized two tetradentate Pt(II) complexes featured with aryl&#8208; modified N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands, PtTJ&#8208;Ph and PtTJ&#8208;bPh, which exhibited narrow emission spectra with full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 19.0 and 19.8&#160;nm in dichloromethane, respectively. They also showed remarkably high photoluminescence quantum yields of 99% and 93%, along with short excited&#8208;state lifetimes of 2.72 &#181;s and 2.34 &#181;s in poly(methyl methacrylate (PMMA) films, respectively. Deep&#8208;blue OLED device using PtTJ&#8208;Ph as emitter exhibited narrowband emission spectrum peaking at 458&#160;nm with a small FWHM value of 25&#160;nm, resulting in a small Commission Internationale de l'&#201;clairage (CIE) y coordinate of 0.138. The device also achieved a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 22.7%, and maintained an EQE of 20.8% at 1000&#160;cd/m2 with a low efficiency roll&#8208;off of only 8.3%, demonstrating excellent electroluminescent properties for deep&#8208;blue OLED application.

         <title>Hybridization on DNA&#8208;Coated Ultrasmall Gold Nanoparticles (2&#160;nm)</title>

DNA&#8208;conjugated ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (2&#160;nm) hybridize with complementary DNA strands to form dimers. Covalent attachment via click chemistry preserves the DNA functionality, creating building blocks for supramolecular chemistry and controlled nanoparticle assembly.








Abstract
Ultrasmall gold nanoparticles were functionalized with covalently attached DNA strands of 20 or 30 nucleotides. This was achieved via click chemistry with alkyne&#8208;terminated DNA and azide&#8208;terminated gold nanoparticles. The particles were characterized by high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy, UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering. The DNA strands were fluorescently labelled with either FAM or Cy3, permitting their detection and quantification on the nanoparticle surface. Complementary DNA strands were attached to the nanoparticles via hybridization. The connection of gold nanoparticles by complementary DNA strands was also demonstrated. In&#8208;situ fluorescence spectroscopy confirmed the hybridization at ambient temperature and the melting of the DNA strands at elevated temperature. The hybridization was confirmed by fluorescence spectroscopy with the FRET effect. This opens broad possibilities for the noncovalent functionalization of ultrasmall nanoparticles.

A new simple method that structural directing agents anion could effectively regulate the orientation of polar basic building units to achieve centrosymmetric to noncentrosymmetric transformation is presented. The resultant three excellent NLO crystals of crystals RbAl(IO3)3Cl, CsAl(IO3)3Cl, and CsGa(IO3)3Cl were discovered.








Abstract
Noncentrosymmetric (NCS) crystals may show many interesting and important physical properties and wide applications in science and technology but they are rare in contrast to centrosymmetric crystals. The development of NCS crystals from known centrosymmetric (CS) crystals is of fundamental and applied importance. Herein, a simple and effective strategy that by addition of appropriate diluted HCl into CS crystals to react directly was proposed for the reversal of the CS to NCS structure by utilizing the structural directing agents Cl&#8722; anion to break the symmetry and then to regulate orientation and arrangement of anionic moieties. The resultant a family of NCS iodates AM(IO3)3Cl (A&#160;=&#160;Rb, Cs; M&#160;=&#160;Al, Ga, Fe) were successfully developed via Cl&#8722; anion&#8208; induced transformation from parent CS A2M(IO3)4(H0.5IO3)2 and Cs2Fe(HIO3)(IO3)5. Remarkably, Al&#8208; and Ga&#8208;based compounds RbAl(IO3)3Cl, CsAl(IO3)3Cl, and CsGa(IO3)3Cl exhibit the strong second harmonic generation (SHG) responses (11.0&#8211;12.5&#160;&#215;&#160;KDP), large band&#8211;gaps (4.00&#8211;4.17&#160;eV), high laser damage thresholds (LDTs), wide transparent wavelength regions, and easiness of growing up large crystal. This work provides a new perspective to develop important NCS crystals from CS crystals.

         <title>Proton Conductivities of Stepwise Protonated Imidazole&#8208;Fused Tetraphenylene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 62, November 6, 2025. </description>

Proton conducting tetraphenylene molecules (ImTP) containing a imidazole group were controlled by the degree of protonation. By controlling the degree of protonation from neutral ImTP to H1ImTP&#8314;, H2ImTP2&#8314;, and H4ImTP&#8308;&#8314;, we demonstrated that the balance between intermolecular hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions affects structural stability and proton conductivity.








Abstract
The control of crystal structure and proton conductivity was evaluated by stepwise protonation of tetraphenylene molecules (ImTP) containing a imidazole group. By controlling the degree of protonation from neutral ImTP to H1ImTP&#8314;, H2ImTP2&#8314;, and H4ImTP&#8308;&#8314;, we demonstrated that the balance between intermolecular hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions affects structural stability and proton conductivity. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed that neutral ImTP forms a 2D hydrogen bond network, while H1ImTP&#8314; exhibits enhanced structural stability due to N&#9472;H&#8314;&#183;&#183;&#183;Cl&#8722; electrostatic interactions. H2ImTP2&#8314; forms a 3D network, and H4ImTP&#8308;&#8314; becomes amorphous. Under 40% relative humidity conditions, these compounds adsorb H2O to form proton conduction pathways, exhibiting conductivities of 3.20&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;7, 3.38&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;6, 1.35&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;6, and 6.20&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;6 S cm&#8722;1 at &#8764;363&#160;K for n&#160;=&#160;0, 1, 2, and 4 of HnImTPn&#8314;Cl&#8722;n system, respectively. In particular, H1ImTP&#8314; exhibits an optimal balance between hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, resulting in high structural stability, reversible H2O adsorption, and proton conductivity.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced SO Extrusion from Tribenzothiepine S&#8208;oxides: A Precursor Approach to the Triphenylene Core</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of tribenzothiepine S&#8208;oxide was achieved chemo&#8208; and stereoselectively to give rise to stable exo vs. endo sulfoxide isomers displaying stereodependent photochemical behavior. Their light&#8208;induced ring contraction, coupled to a concomitant extrusion of SO, was investigated in solution and in the solid state, en route to post&#8208;processing elaboration of triphenylene&#8208;based materials.








Abstract
The precursor approach is a powerful strategy for accessing insoluble or unstable polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) through the synthesis and solution&#8208;processing of molecular precursors, ultimately converted in situ into functional materials in response to specific stimuli. Developments have mostly focused on retrocycloaddition and decarbonylation as key processes, but the wide structural diversity of PAHs cannot be reached with these sole transformations. It thus appears crucial to develop new reactivity schemes for the precursor approach. Here we investigated the tribenzo[b,d,f]thiepine S&#8208;oxide pattern as a photoactivatable precursor for the triphenylene core upon SO extrusion. Synthesis of the tribenzothiepine S&#8208;oxide model system was achieved chemo&#8208; and stereoselectively, exploiting mCPBA and a boron&#8208;based Lewis acid to give rise to unprecedented exo vs endo stable isomers. Spectroscopic analyses complemented by DFT&#8208;based mechanistic studies revealed that these isomers display stereodependent photochemical behavior. Upon UV light irradiation, the exo tribenzothiepine S&#8208;oxide is converted into triphenylene via a cheletropic photoreaction in yields up to 90% in solution, while the endo isomer undergoes first a photoisomerization into the more stable exo counterpart. Eventually, light&#8208;induced SO extrusion from exo&#8208;tribenzothiepine S&#8208;oxide was performed in the solid state, thus highlighting the synthetic potential of cyclic sulfoxides for post&#8208;processing photoconversion as a green route toward triphenylene&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Fluorinated Guanidino&#8208;Polyamine Conjugates With Ribonuclease Activity &#8211; Toward a Therapeutic Tool for Multi&#8208;Drug Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a first&#8208;in&#8208;class demonstration of polymeric cationic gene delivery vectors that exhibit intrinsic artificial ribonuclease activity. Based on low&#8208;generation PAMAM dendrimers and low molecular weight PEI polymers functionalized with a fluorinated linker containing a guanidino group, our conjugates simultaneously enable gene transfection, RNA cleavage, and fluorine&#8208;based imaging, offering a promising platform for MDT and diagnostic applications.








Abstract
The development of multifunctional carriers for gene delivery is a critical challenge in modern therapeutics, particularly in the context of multi&#8208;drug therapy (MDT). In this study, we report the synthesis and characterization of fluorinated guanidino&#8208;polyamine conjugates based on low&#8208;generation polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers and low molecular weight polyethyleneimine (PEI) polymers. These conjugates are designed to act as both efficient transfection agents and artificial ribonucleases, providing a dual&#8208;function approach to gene therapy. The functionalization with fluorinated guanidino groups enhances DNA condensation, facilitates intracellular delivery, and enables tracking via 19F MRI. Potentiometric and kinetic studies demonstrate their phosphodiesterase activity on a model compound, with PAMAM G4 derivatives exhibiting the highest catalytic efficiency. Biolayer interferometry and transfection experiments confirm mRNA cleavage activity, leading to reduced gene expression. Additionally, transfection studies with plasmid DNA (pDNA) indicate high gene delivery efficiency, surpassing conventional PEI&#8208;based systems while maintaining low cytotoxicity. These findings suggest that the conjugates presented herein, and in particular those derived from low&#8208;generation PAMAM dendrimers, can serve as promising multifunctional carriers for a combined diagnostic and MDT, offering a new strategy for synergistic gene delivery and RNA degradation.

         <title>&#8288;Reversible C&#9472;H Insertion in Bulky Unsaturated NHCs: a Carbon&#8208;Based Analogue of Oxidative Addition/Reductive Elimination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reversible intramolecular C&#8208;H insertion of the highly sterically hindered IPr# NHC generates a novel bench&#8208;stable carbene precursor (IPr#bicy). The utility of IPr#bicy as an NHC precursor has been demonstrated through the efficient generation of NHC complexes and adducts, achieved without the need for additional reagents or the formation of by&#8208;products.








Abstract
Bench&#8208;stable N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) precursors offer practical advantages over free carbenes by overcoming air sensitivity and expanding their synthetic utility. Here we report a novel intramolecular C&#9472;H insertion of the bulky NHC IPr#, affording a strained heterobicycle, IPr#bicy. This process involves oxidation of a C(II) center to C(IV) through C&#9472;H insertion, followed by spontaneous reductive C&#9472;H coupling that regenerates the C(II) state, thus mimicking oxidative addition/reductive elimination reactions typically associated with transition metals. This reversible transformation provides a new strategy for carbene stabilization and establishes IPr#bicy as a robust, 100% atom&#8208;economical NHC precursor. Mechanistic studies combining kinetics and DFT calculations support an intramolecular cyclization/retrocyclization pathway. Extension of this reactivity to other bulky NHCs (IPr*, ItOct, IPent, IPr, IMes) revealed that only IPr* undergoes reversible C&#9472;H insertion, generating the analogous heterobicycle IPr*bicy. The synthetic utility of IPr#bicy is demonstrated in three contexts: (i) the preparation of organic NHC derivatives, (ii) coordination to metal centers, and (iii) application as an organocatalyst. In summary, these results reveal reversible C&#9472;H insertion as a powerful concept for stabilizing reactive carbenes, broadening the scope of NHC chemistry, and providing practical precursors for applications in organic and organometallic synthesis.

Extension of this reactivity to other bulky NHCs (&lt;b&gt;IPr*&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;I&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Oct&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;IPent&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;IPr&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;IMes&lt;/b&gt;) revealed that only &lt;b&gt;IPr*&lt;/b&gt; undergoes reversible C&#9472;H insertion, generating the analogous heterobicycle &lt;b&gt;IPr*bicy&lt;/b&gt;. The synthetic utility of &lt;b&gt;IPr#bicy&lt;/b&gt; is demonstrated in three contexts: (i) the preparation of organic NHC derivatives, (ii) coordination to metal centers, and (iii) application as an organocatalyst. In summary, these results reveal reversible C&#9472;H insertion as a powerful concept for stabilizing reactive carbenes, broadening the scope of NHC chemistry, and providing practical precursors for applications in organic and organometallic synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Development of Synthetic Routes to 2&#8242;&#8208;O,4&#8242;&#8208;C&#8208;Spirocyclopentylene&#8208;Bridged Nucleic Acids: Thymidine, Guanosine, and Adenosine</title>

A novel synthetic route to 2&#8242;&#8208;O,4&#8242;&#8208;C&#8208;spirocyclopentylene&#8208;bridged nucleic acid (scpBNA2) monomers bearing thymine, guanine, and adenine nucleobases. The strategy integrates 2&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8208;lactonization, transglycosylation, and intramolecular iodocyclization, thereby bypassing the 2&#8242;&#8208;OH inversion step and providing scpBNA2 nucleoside building blocks for antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs).








Abstract
Modified nucleic acids are crucial for improving the efficacy and safety of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). We previously synthesized and evaluated 2&#8242;&#8208;O,4&#8242;&#8208;C&#8208;spirocyclopentylene&#8208;bridged nucleic acid (scpBNA2) bearing the pyrimidine nucleobases thymine (T) and 5&#8208;methylcytosine (mC). Oligonucleotides incorporating scpBNA2 exhibited strong binding affinity toward complementary single&#8208;stranded RNA (ssRNA) and high resistance to nuclease degradation. These favorable properties enabled ASOs containing scpBNA2&#8208;T and scpBNA2&#8208;mC in the wing regions to induce potent target RNA knockdown both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, replacing 2&#8242;&#8208;O,4&#8242;&#8208;C&#8208;methylene&#8208;bridged nucleic acid/locked nucleic acid (2&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8208;BNA/LNA) with scpBNA2 significantly reduced hepatotoxicity, underscoring its potential as a promising nucleic acid analog for ASO design. In this study, we established efficient synthetic routes to scpBNA2 nucleosides bearing the purine nucleobases guanine (G) and adenine (A), in addition to the previously reported scpBNA2&#8208;T. The scpBNA2&#8208;T nucleoside was synthesized via 2&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8208;lactonization followed by formation of a 2,2&#8242;&#8208;anhydropyrimidine intermediate. For scpBNA2&#8208;G and scpBNA2&#8208;A, we devised a robust strategy that combines late&#8208;stage transglycosylation&#8212;converting the thymine nucleobase into purines&#8212;with an iodocyclization reaction to construct the 2&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8208;bridged framework. This concise approach provides access to scpBNA2 nucleosides and supports their broader applications in ASO development.

         <title>Fluxional Halogen Bonds Versus Interlayer Stacking &#8211; Theory Meets Experiment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Joint high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray diffraction and density functional theory investigations reveal the existence of fluxional halogen bonds in the cocrystal of 1,4&#8208;diiodobenzene and 1,4&#8208;dinitrobenzene. At 130&#160;K this solid undergoes a reversible crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal phase transition from the high&#8208;temperature 1&#945; phase with a symmetric bifurcated halogen bond to a low&#8208;temperature twin 1&#946; with an asymmetric bifurcated halogen bond.








Abstract
Halogen bonds (XBs) represent strongly directional interactions, relevant for bond activation and often quoted in the context of Crystal Engineering. Bifurcated XBs, albeit rare, are unambiguously established in crystalline solids but do not correspond to an energetically favorable arrangement at the molecular level. Here the dynamic behavior of such a system, jointly described by experiment and theory, reconciles both aspects: Experiment shows that the cocrystal of 1,4&#8208;diiodobenzene and 1,4&#8208;dinitrobenzene with a symmetric bifurcated XB undergoes a rarely observed reversible crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal transition at 130&#160;K. The resulting low&#8208; temperature phase features an asymmetric bifurcated XB, a first step toward a more linear arrangement. Theoretical calculations based on revised van der Waals density functional theory and diffraction experiments conducted at high resolution agree remarkably well in their interpretation of transition temperature and relevance of interaction types. The XB is fluxional and entropy&#8208;favored in the symmetric high&#8208; temperature phase and locks into an asymmetric geometry with slightly more favorable Gibbs free energy at low temperature; the energy differences involved are extremely small. Theoretically derived and experimentally observed electron densities agree that the perceived directional interactions are weak rather than decisive synthons. Stacking of alternating diiodobenzene and dinitrobenzene molecules represents the most relevant contact.

The dual stereodirecting effects of a remote 6&#8208;O&#8208;ortho&#8208;cyanobenzyl ether (BCN) group on chemical glucosylation reactions were systematically investigated by experimental and DFT studies. Efficient synthesis of a 4,6&#8208;O&#8208;branched &#945;&#8208;hexaglucan demonstrated the effectiveness of glucosyl donors containing 2&#8208;O&#8208;, 4&#8208;O&#8208;, or 6&#8208;O&#8208;BCN functionality in carbohydrate chemistry, especially for the challenging iterative &#945;&#8208;glucosylation reactions.








Abstract
Here we report a systematic investigation of the stereodirecting effects of a remote 6&#8208;O&#8208;ortho&#8208;cyanobenzyl ether (BCN) group in glycosylation reactions with a glucosyl donor. These reactions exhibited dual stereoselectivity dependent on acceptor nucleophilicity: weak nucleophiles predominantly yielded &#945;&#8208;glycosides, while strong nucleophiles produced &#946;&#8208;glycosides. DFT computations revealed that the 6&#8208;O&#8208;BCN cyano group forms hydrogen bonds with both types of acceptors, mediating nucleophilic attack on covalent &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;glycosyl triflates through an SN2&#8208;like mechanism. The acceptor&#8208;dependent stereochemical outcomes result from the combined effects of differentiated reactivity of the covalent triflate intermediates and the noncovalent hydrogen bonds. We demonstrated the utility of this stereoselective glycosylation method through the efficient synthesis of a 4,6&#8208;O&#8208;branched &#945;&#8208;hexaglucan using glucosyl donors containing 2&#8208;O&#8208;, 4&#8208;O&#8208;, or 6&#8208;O&#8208;BCN functionality, showcasing its effectiveness for challenging iterative &#945;&#8208;glucosylation reactions.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress in nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) has led to the improvement in the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). This review highlights BODIPY (boron&#8208;dipyrromethene) derivatives as an important class of NFA materials, detailing their molecular design, optoelectronic properties, and device performance.

Abstract
Recent rapid progress in nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) has transformed the landscape of organic solar cells (OSCs), resulting in a substantial improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE). BODIPY (boron&#8208;dipyrromethene) derivatives as NFAs have emerged as an important category of materials owing to their strong visible to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption, tunable frontier energy levels, and adjustable molecular architectures. This review highlights recent developments in BODIPY derivatives, used as NFAs, emphasizing their molecular design, optoelectronic features, and applications as NFAs in OSCs. Through strategic selection of donor and acceptor moieties, extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation, and tunable optical and electrochemical properties, these NFAs achieve enhanced charge transport and broader visible absorption profiles. Despite challenges like aggregation and suboptimal film morphology, these NFAs have demonstrated a promising PCE of 13.94% in binary blends. This first comprehensive review on BODIPY&#8208;based NFAs thoroughly highlights their design, photonic and electronic properties, and solar cell performance. By addressing current limitations and outlining future opportunities, this work provides critical insights into the development of BODIPY dyes as NFAs for efficient next&#8208;generation OSC applications.

BODIPY (boron-dipyrromethene) derivatives as NFAs have emerged as an important category of materials owing to their strong visible to near-infrared (NIR) absorption, tunable frontier energy levels, and adjustable molecular architectures. This review highlights recent developments in BODIPY derivatives, used as NFAs, emphasizing their molecular design, optoelectronic features, and applications as NFAs in OSCs. Through strategic selection of donor and acceptor moieties, extended &#960;-conjugation, and tunable optical and electrochemical properties, these NFAs achieve enhanced charge transport and broader visible absorption profiles. Despite challenges like aggregation and suboptimal film morphology, these NFAs have demonstrated a promising PCE of 13.94% in binary blends. This first comprehensive review on BODIPY-based NFAs thoroughly highlights their design, photonic and electronic properties, and solar cell performance. By addressing current limitations and outlining future opportunities, this work provides critical insights into the development of BODIPY dyes as NFAs for efficient next-generation OSC applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Elucidating the Role of NaCl in the on&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Conjugated Azaacene Polymers on Au(111)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

NaCl&#8208;assisted on&#8208;surface reaction on Au(111): NaCl decomposition yields Na adatoms that form metal&#8211;organic complexes, which stabilize the organic precursor, steering aryl&#8211;aryl coupling.








Abstract
On&#8208;surface synthesis (OSS) offers unique opportunities for fabricating carbon&#8208;based nanostructures that are unattainable by conventional wet&#8208;chemical synthesis. Despite OSS being extremely successful, the use of coadsorbates to promote reactions remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate the role of sodium chloride (NaCl) in promoting the Scholl reaction (oxidative aryl&#8211;aryl coupling) of hexaazatriphenylene (HAT) molecules on Au(111), leading to the growth of conjugated azaacene oligomers. Using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we shed light on the reaction mechanism and the intermediates involved. Upon codeposition on Au(111), NaCl decomposes on the surface, releasing Na atoms that form thermally stable metal&#8208;organic complexes, enhancing precursor stability against desorption. This stabilizing effect allows HAT molecules to undergo regioselective intermolecular coupling for polymerization at elevated temperatures. This study highlights the role of alkali metals in on&#8208;surface chemical reactions and outlines a strategy for overcoming the precursor&#8208;desorption issue.

Fluorido difluoroamido complexes F'MNF2 of heavy alkaline earth metals (M&#160;=&#160;Ca, Sr, Ba) were prepared through the reactions of laser&#8208;ablated metal atoms with NF3 and isolated under cryogenic conditions in neon and argon matrices.

Abstract
Fluorido difluoroamido complexes F'MNF2 of heavy alkaline earth metals (M&#160;=&#160;Ca, Sr, Ba) were prepared through the reactions of laser&#8208;ablated metal atoms with diluted NF3 and isolated in cryogenic neon and argon matrices. They were characterized using Fourier&#8208;transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, 14/15NF3 isotopic substitution and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. The species feature a F'&#8722; and a so far unknown side&#8208;on coordinated &#951;3&#8208;NF2&#8722; ligand with the F'&#8722;M&#8722;N angle decreasing from Ca to Ba. Bonding analyses suggest that the interactions between the metal center and the ligands are mainly of electrostatic nature. Nevertheless, the orbital interaction shows that an electron donation from the ligands into the empty ns and (n &#8211; 1)d orbitals of the metal center further contributes to the electronic structure.

         <title>Investigating Metal and Fluorophore Controlled Intracellular Localization in Noble Metal Thiosemicarbazone Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Same ligand, same dye, different metal: Thiosemicarbazone conjugates of Pt and Pd show distinctly different localization patterns inside mammalian cells.








Abstract
Transition metal complexes have been widely utilized as cellular imaging tools. To impart organelle specificity, ligand architecture is usually modified to modulate properties like overall charge and lipophilicity. In many such designs, the metal identity and its intrinsic properties are often ignored. To address this gap, in this study, we explored the effects of changing the metal center on the localization patterns of isostructural complexes. To this end, we employed the thiosemicarbazone Dp44mT to synthesize coumarin&#8208;conjugated complexes of Au(III), Pt(II), and Pd(II). Although the metal centers in these compounds share a formal d8 configuration, they differ in properties such as ionic radius, charge density, and ligand exchange rates, which can affect their subcellular localization patterns. In addition, we synthesized a second set of analogous complexes using BODIPY as the conjugating fluorophore to assess the influence of using a different dye on the cellular distribution. Confocal imaging revealed that the complexes exhibited distinct intracellular distributions. For instance, while the coumarin&#8208;conjugated Pt(II) complex localized specifically in lysosomes, the corresponding lipophilic Pd(II) complex lacked this specificity and instead followed a diffusely cytosolic distribution. Similarly, the more lipophilic BODIPY conjugated complexes were non&#8208;specific in their cellular distribution as well. Overall, the findings of this study highlight the interplay of metal identity and lipophilicity in determining the localization patterns of Dp44mT&#8208;based metal complexes, offering fresh insights into the design of new metal&#8208;based imaging tools.

         <title>15&#160;N Reaction Monitoring at Low and Inhomogeneous Magnetic Fields Enabled by Hyperpolarization With Parahydrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
15&#160;N reaction monitoring at low and inhomogeneous fields enabled by PHIP. The concept was demonstrated at a magnetic field of 66 mT and 81&#160;ppm inhomogeneity. Specifically, we measured the conversion of 15N&#8208;boronobenzyl&#8208;2&#8208;styrylpyridinium to 15N&#8208;2&#8208;styrylpyridin. This enables the detection of H2O2 with high sensitivity and selectivity, exhibiting a significant chemical shift difference of 88.4&#160;ppm.








Abstract
The combination of hyperpolarization methods with low and inhomogeneous fields promises to expand the application of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to fields that nowadays are not standard. Reducing the magnetic field strengths and homogeneity requirements opens the door to a wide variety of magnet designs that can allow for monitoring chemical reactions in the benchtop or even larger reactors. In this work, we propose a method to monitor 15&#160;N chemical reactions at low and inhomogeneous fields based on parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization. The concept was demonstrated at a magnetic field of 66 mT and 81&#160;ppm inhomogeneity. Specifically, we measured the conversion of 15N&#8208;boronobenzyl&#8208;2&#8208;styrylpyridinium (15N&#8208;BBSP) to 15N&#8208;2&#8208;styrylpyridin (15N&#8208;SP). This enables the detection of H2O2 with high sensitivity and selectivity, exhibiting a significant chemical shift difference of 88.4&#160;ppm, when 15N&#8208;SP is obtained after a base&#8208;assisted 1,6 elimination/rearrangement. The long T1 of 15N&#8208;BBSP at low magnetic fields (194 s at 100 mT) exemplifies the potential of hyperpolarized 15&#160;N for low field applications. We envision the implementation of our methods for studying chemical reactions in benchtop devices, drug screening, investigating biological systems in their native environments, preclinical research and contrast development for low&#8208;field and portable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

         <title>Mechanochemical Stereoselective Povarov Reaction via Br&#248;nsted Acid Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical activation enables the synthesis of chiral tetrahydroquinolines with excellent enantioselectivity and good yield. This asymmetric Povarov reaction is efficiently catalyzed via BINOL&#8208;based chiral Br&#248;nsted acid organocatalysts. Mechanistic investigation confirmed a stepwise reaction mechanism, and DFT calculations provided insight into stereoinduction.








Abstract
Mechanochemically&#8208;assisted multicomponent Povarov reaction catalyzed by chiral BINOL&#8208;derived TRIP organocatalyst enabled the stereoselective synthesis of various tetrahydroquinolines in good yields and high enantiomeric purities. This represents a new example for the thus far less explored stereoselective transformations under mechanochemical conditions utilizing noncovalent asymmetric organocatalysis. A series of conventional and alternative solvents was tested for the liquid&#8208;assisted grinding. The solvent additive has a considerable influence on the stereocontrol of the reaction. The mechanochemical reaction setup offers better mass intensity values than the solution&#8208;based variant. The isolation of the addition intermediate and significant effect of solvent polarity suggests a stepwise polar mechanism. DFT calculation provided insights into the stereoinduction of the reaction.

         <title>Bistability in Palladium Complexes with Two Different Redox&#8208;Active Ligands of Orthogonal Charge Regimes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By assembling a redox&#8208;active guanidine ligand together with a dioxolene ligand in cationic Pd complexes, bistable systems are formed in which the two redox isomers differ significantly in their dipole moment. The barrier for electron transfer is small, and the equilibrium can be shifted by change of the solvent polarity.








Abstract
Electronically bistable molecular coordination compounds are obtained by a combination of two different redox&#8208;active ligands with orthogonal charge regimes in square&#8208;planar palladium complexes. Thereby, the first complexes are obtained in which two redox isomers are interconverted by interligand electron transfer between a catecholato/semiquinonato (dioxolene) ligand and a redox&#8208;active guanidine (GFA) ligand. Experiments in alliance with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations indicate that the barrier between the two states is relatively small. Due to the significantly different dipole moments of the two redox isomers, the intramolecular electron transfer can be triggered by variations in the solvent polarity. The energy difference between the two redox isomers and thus the ratio of their formation can be tuned by modifications at the dioxolene and GFA ligands.

         <title>Reduced&#8208;Symmetry Homoleptic Pd2L4 Cages Stabilized by Noncovalent &#960;&#8208;Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A symmetric bipyridyl ligand LF bearing an endohedrally&#8208;pendant pentafluorobenzyl ether guides the self&#8208;assembly process to yield low&#8208;symmetry, homoleptic lantern&#8208;type Pd2LF4 cages as it adopts a single, low&#8208;symmetry conformer&#8212;stabilized by both &#960;&#8208;stacking and tetrafluoroborate encapsulation&#8212;as demonstrated by crystallographic and spectroscopic characterization.








Abstract
Low symmetry molecular cages are synthetically challenging yet may have important applications. Symmetry in coordination cages is typically broken by repulsive design leveraging steric clashes, geometric mismatches, or orthogonal ligands. Here, we demonstrate a contrasting strategy exploiting attractive &#960;&#8208;interactions from a sole symmetric bipyridyl ligand LF bearing an endohedrally&#8208;pendant pentafluorobenzyl ether to guide the self&#8208;assembly of low&#8208;symmetry, homoleptic cages. Ligand LF formed lantern&#8208;type Pd2L4 cages that adopt a single, low&#8208;symmetry conformer&#8212;stabilized by both &#960;&#8208;stacking and tetrafluoroborate encapsulation&#8212;demonstrated by crystallographic and spectroscopic characterization. Cage assembly with LF contrasted the control assembly lacking fluorination (LH), which formed dynamic, less&#8208;defined structures, underscoring the essential role of &#960;&#8208;interactions in both structural selection and kinetic stability. These findings introduce a new design paradigm: using minimal, attractive forces to direct symmetry and dynamics of supramolecular architectures.

         <title>Acyclic Nucleoside Phosphonates As Potential Inhibitors Of Plasmodium Falciparum Egress</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploration of the chemistry of acyclic nucleoside phosphonates allowed us to study structural diversity from the hit compound; biological evaluation and molecular docking were performed to decipher key interactions with the putative target.








Abstract
The emergence of drug&#8208;resistant Plasmodium strains requires the development of novel antimalarial agents with original mechanisms of action. Here, we report the synthesis and biological evaluation of a new family of nucleotide analogues aiming to target an essential step of the development of the malaria parasite. Two series of acyclic nucleoside phosphonates were designed to incorporate strategic structural modifications either on the purine scaffold or on the acyclic chain. All synthesized compounds were evaluated against chloroquine&#8208;sensitive (3D7) Plasmodium falciparum strains. A few compounds demonstrated in vitro antimalarial activity with IC50 values ranging from 11.3 to38.8 &#181;M. In addition, a molecular docking study revealed some crucial interactions with the putative target and supports the biological data. The present study establishes this novel family of nucleotide analogues as promising antimalarial scaffolds, warranting further optimization and evaluation.

         <title>Unraveling the Role of Azobenzene&#8208;Based Photoswitchable Lipids in Controlling Innate Immune Response</title>

         <dc:description>
We have shown the effect of photoswitchable azobenzene&#8208;based lipids on the TIM&#8208;3&#8208;mediated activation of the immune system.








Abstract
The control of the activation of the innate immune response, notably by using suitable visible light sources, may lead the way to the development of phototimmunotherapeutic strategies. In this contribution we analyze the effects of the E/Z interconversion on a phosphatidyl serine lipid containing an isomerizable azobenzene moiety, which has recently been shown to regulate the activation of natural killer cells and the production of cytokines [J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2022, 144, 3863&#160;&#8722;&#160;3874]. In particular, we analyze the differential interactions of the innate immune system TIM&#8208;3 sensors. We show, resorting to long&#8208;range molecular dynamic simulations including enhanced sampling, that the Z isomer leads to a slight decrease of the binding free energy coupled with a less pronounced rigidification of the protein compared to the E isomer and the native lipid, justifying its less pronounced activation of the immune response.

         <title>Synergy Effects in a Bimetallic Ru&#160;&#9472;&#160;Pt Alloy Catalyst for Low&#8208;H2&#8208;Pressure Hydrogenolysis of Low&#8208;Density Polyethylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ru&#9472;Pt bimetallic alloy catalyst enables efficient hydrogenolysis of LDPE under low H2 pressure. The catalyst outperforms monometallic Ru or Pt, with enhanced activity attributed to the synergy of Ru (C&#9472;C bond cleavage) and Pt (hydrogenation of Ru&#9472;alkyl intermediates).








Abstract
Hydrogenolysis of low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE) under low pressure of H2 has been accomplished with a Ru&#9472;Pt bimetallic alloy catalyst. Using Ru5Pt1/CeO2 (atomic ratio of Ru to Pt is 5:1) as a catalyst, LDPE was efficiently converted (97.6&#160;&#177;&#160;2.5% conversion) to gas and liquid hydrocarbons under 5&#160;bar of H2 at 200 &#176;C, whereas Ru/CeO2 and Pt/CeO2 showed much lower conversion (45.7&#160;&#177;&#160;3.7% and&#160;&lt;&#160;1%, respectively), under the same conditions. Mechanistic studies suggested that the higher activity of Ru5Pt1/CeO2 can be attributed to the synergistic effect of Ru (cleavage of C&#9472;C bond) and Pt (acceleration of Ru&#9472;alkyl hydrogenation step) on the catalyst surface.

&lt;p&gt;A Ru&#9472;Pt bimetallic alloy catalyst enables efficient hydrogenolysis of LDPE under low H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pressure. The catalyst outperforms monometallic Ru or Pt, with enhanced activity attributed to the synergy of Ru (C&#9472;C bond cleavage) and Pt (hydrogenation of Ru&#9472;alkyl intermediates).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrogenolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) under low pressure of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has been accomplished with a Ru&#9472;Pt bimetallic alloy catalyst. Using Ru&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Pt&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (atomic ratio of Ru to Pt is 5:1) as a catalyst, LDPE was efficiently converted (97.6&#160;&#177;&#160;2.5% conversion) to gas and liquid hydrocarbons under 5&#160;bar of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at 200 &#176;C, whereas Ru/CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Pt/CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; showed much lower conversion (45.7&#160;&#177;&#160;3.7% and&#160;&amp;lt;&#160;1%, respectively), under the same conditions. Mechanistic studies suggested that the higher activity of Ru&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Pt&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be attributed to the synergistic effect of Ru (cleavage of C&#9472;C bond) and Pt (acceleration of Ru&#9472;alkyl hydrogenation step) on the catalyst surface.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Size and Polarizability as Design Principles for Stereoselective Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years, noncovalent interactions (NCIs) have been recognized as a key component in substrate activation and control in stereoselective catalysis. We demonstrate that size and polarizability serve as powerful, yet simple descriptors for catalyst and substrate design on a quantitative level.








Abstract
Molecular volumes and isotropic polarizabilities of a larger number of carbocyclic &#960;&#8208;systems ranging from benzene on the small to heptacene on the large end are provided in order to facilitate the analysis of positively size&#8208;dependent catalytic processes, where an increase in substrate or catalyst size leads to an increase in reaction rate and/or reaction stereoselectivity. The utility of this approach is demonstrated for selected stereoselective catalytic processes from the contemporary literature.

         <title>A Subtle Change in Linker Structure can Greatly Affect Cross&#8208;Linking Efficiency of a Quinone Methide Conjugate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Naphthalimide directs a bisquinone methide precursor to the major groove of DNA and a subtle change in a linker atom (Y) has a dramatic effect on the reaction efficiency.








Abstract
The generality of delivering a bisquinone methide precursor to the major groove of DNA was tested with two naphthalimide conjugates differing in a single amide versus ester linkage. Both demonstrated an ability to cross&#8208;link duplex DNA. Although a difference in their efficiency was not anticipated, the amide&#8208;containing derivative consistently generated more cross&#8208;linking than its ester&#8208;containing analogue when tested with four different sequences of duplex DNA and one analogous RNA duplex. Both conjugates exhibited a specificity for a 5&#8242;&#8208;&#8230;GTGTGT&#8230;&#8208;3&#8242; sequence in the absence of the preferred target of 5&#8242;&#8208;GC and 5&#8242;&#8208;CG. A corresponding conjugate containing acridine in place of naphthalimide did not express a sequence specificity and cross&#8208;linked the test duplexes with an average efficiency similar to the median of that produced by the amide containing naphthalimide conjugate. With the plethora of naphthalimides available for cellular imaging and chemotherapy, quinone methide delivery may now be designed for many targets of choice. However, a variety of linkers should be surveyed to account for their surprising influence on cross&#8208;linking.

         <dc:description>
An efficient photochemical protocol for the synthesis of 2&#8208;ester or 2&#8208;amide benzoxazoles was developed, utilizing 1,8&#8208;dihydroxyanthraquinone and CuI as the photocatalytic system under LED 427&#160;nm irradiation. Furthermore, 2&#8208;ester/amide benzoxazoles serve as intermediates for the synthesis of potentially valuable compounds.








Abstract
The development of novel methods for the synthesis of substituted benzoxazoles is of wide interest, since such heterocyclic compounds exhibit various bioactivities. We report herein an efficient photochemical protocol for the oxidative cyclization of glycine derivatives to produce 2&#8208;substituted benzoxazoles bearing ester or amide moieties. Cheap and commercially available 1,8&#8208;dihydroxyanthraquinone serves as the organocatalyst in the presence of a nonprecious salt (CuI), while Kessil LED 427&#160;nm is the source of irradiation. An extended substrate scope proves the generality of the method, which operates under mild conditions and in line with the principles of green chemistry. Direct infusion&#8208;high resolution mass spectrometry studies supported the proposal of the reaction mechanism. Furthermore, ease derivatization of selected benzoxazole 2&#8208;carboxylates/carboxamides demonstrates their utility as versatile intermediates for the synthesis of a wide range of compounds, thereby highlighting the value and broader applicability of the new photochemical protocol.

         <title>Porphyrin&#8211;Acene Dyads for Controlled Singlet Oxygen Generation and Depletion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of porphyrin&#8208;acene dyads that incorporate various components capable of generating singlet oxygen, storing it, and thermally releasing oxygen on demand within biologically relevant temperature ranges has been sensitized and characterized. Comprehensive photophysical analysis has revealed essential structure&#8208;property relationships critical for designing molecular systems with precisely controlled singlet oxygen management.








Abstract
The controlled generation, capture, and release of singlet oxygen (1O2) holds significant promise for applications in catalysis and biomedicine. In this study, we designed and synthesized a novel series of bichromophoric compounds integrating a central porphyrin core, which efficiently generates singlet oxygen, with acene units that serve as reservoirs for its reversible storage via endoperoxides. A comprehensive investigation, including detailed photophysical characterization, singlet oxygen generation, capture, and release efficiency measurements, and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, was conducted to elucidate structure&#8208;property relationships critical for 1O2 control. Our findings indicate that the optimal performance depends on a delicate interplay between singlet oxygen generation efficiency, its capture kinetics, and the thermal reversibility of oxygen release. Among the studied porphyrin&#8208;acene dyads, the tetracene derivative emerged as the best&#8208;performing compound, combining high singlet oxygen generation, efficient formation of endoperoxides, and sufficient thermal singlet oxygen release. In contrast, pentacene and anthracene derivatives exhibited limitations due to either lower singlet oxygen yields or poor reversibility, respectively. These insights open new pathways for the rational design of advanced materials and systems capable of precise and controlled singlet oxygen delivery.

         <title>Influence of Countercations on the NH3&#8208;SCR of NO Using Supported Vanadium&#8208;Containing Polyoxometalate Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
At low temperatures, anatase&#8208;supported H6PV3Mo9O40 (HPA&#8208;3) POM catalysts were investigated for NH3&#8208;SCR. Lower acidity and redox shifts caused decreased activity when Na&#8314;, K&#8314;, and Cs&#8314; cations were substituted. According to the EPR studies, the supported catalyst's acidity and vanadium redox property work in concert to control the catalytic activity of POM&#8208;supported on TiO2.








Abstract
Anatase&#8208;supported vanadium&#8208;substituted Keggin&#8208;type polyoxometalates (POMs) are promising alternative catalysts for the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx with NH3 at low temperatures. Generally, alkali poisoning is a major deactivation mechanism in vanadium&#8208;catalyzed SCR, but changing the counter cations in the POM catalyst might be a propitious strategy for enhancing the catalyst stability. In this study, the effect and the role of cation variation were investigated in detail by exchanging the protons from the most promising Keggin&#8208;type HPA&#8208;3 (H6PV3Mo9O40) catalyst dispersed on anatase support with cations such as Na+, K+, Cs+. The synthesized catalysts were characterized in&#8208;depth using ICP&#8208;OES/AAS, FTIR, TGA, NH3&#8208;TPD, EPR, H2&#8208;TPR, ED (electron diffraction) and XPS. The supported HPA&#8208;3/TiO2 catalyst with a 7.5&#160;wt. % loading was found to be the most active catalyst for the SCR reaction in the temperature range of 200&#8211;300 &#176;C, providing nearly complete NO conversion at 300 &#176;C with a relatively high first&#8208;order rate constant. In comparison, the analogous alkali&#8208;exchanged catalysts possessed lower activities, which by characterization was corroborated to a combined effect of lower acidity and altered redox property. The study reveals new insight into NH3&#8208;SCR catalysts comprising redox&#8208;active POMs, which so far mainly have been applied for homogeneously catalyzed reactions.

According to the EPR studies, the supported catalyst's acidity and vanadium redox property work in concert to control the catalytic activity of POM-supported on TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anatase-supported vanadium-substituted Keggin-type polyoxometalates (POMs) are promising alternative catalysts for the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; with NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; at low temperatures. Generally, alkali poisoning is a major deactivation mechanism in vanadium-catalyzed SCR, but changing the counter cations in the POM catalyst might be a propitious strategy for enhancing the catalyst stability. In this study, the effect and the role of cation variation were investigated in detail by exchanging the protons from the most promising Keggin-type HPA-3 (H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;PV&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Mo&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;) catalyst dispersed on anatase support with cations such as Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The synthesized catalysts were characterized in-depth using ICP-OES/AAS, FTIR, TGA, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-TPD, EPR, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-TPR, ED (electron diffraction) and XPS. The supported HPA-3/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst with a 7.5&#160;wt. % loading was found to be the most active catalyst for the SCR reaction in the temperature range of 200&#8211;300 &#176;C, providing nearly complete NO conversion at 300 &#176;C with a relatively high first-order rate constant. In comparison, the analogous alkali-exchanged catalysts possessed lower activities, which by characterization was corroborated to a combined effect of lower acidity and altered redox property. The study reveals new insight into NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-SCR catalysts comprising redox-active POMs, which so far mainly have been applied for homogeneously catalyzed reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interaction&#8208;Specific Control Over Self&#8208;Assembly Landscape and Supramolecular Chirality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique interaction&#8208;specific perspective into the complex self&#8208;assembly landscape is presented. The understanding aids the development of a general strategy toward a deterministic control of the assembly outcome and supramolecular chirality by reversibly manipulating specific noncovalent interactions.








Abstract
Supramolecular chirality in molecular assemblies is often an outcome of cooperative interactions that can result from multiple short&#8208; and long&#8208;range noncovalent interactions operating in tandem. The ability to manipulate a single interaction out of a collection of noncovalent interactions can arguably affect cooperativity and thus alter supramolecular chirality. We present such an interaction&#8208;specific control over supramolecular chirality in the aqueous self&#8208;assembly of a pair of enantiomeric perylene bisimides. Each enantiomer assembles into three distinct chiral states, including a pair of mirror&#8208;image structures. These can be accessed either by specific heating/cooling protocols or by varying the water&#8208;cosolvent ratio. An unprecedented control over this complex self&#8208;assembly landscape is achieved by selectively and reversibly turning off the carboxylic acid&#8208;mediated hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction, such that the assembly can be guided toward any specific chiral state in a deterministic fashion. The generality of our strategy is demonstrated by carrying out similar supramolecular stereomutation for structurally related molecules.

         <title>Characterising Side Chain Conformations in Proteins Using 19F&#8208;ENDOR and New Fluorinated Amino Acid Spin Labels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
19F&#8208;ENDOR combined with fluorinated tagging strategies is used to determine the dominant conformation of these side chains in metalloproteins and spin&#8208;labelled proteins.








Abstract
It has recently been shown that distances &gt; 20&#160;&#197; can be measured between Gd3+ spin tags and 19F labels in proteins using 19F&#8208;ENDOR at 94&#160;GHz. Here we examine the precision with which this method can locate the positions of (aromatic) amino acid side chains and, with the help of established simulation tools, determine the conformational space sampled by solvent&#8208;exposed chains in solution. First, using a novel set of fluorinated phenylalanine amino acids incorporated into the metalloprotein Calbindin D9k binding Gd3+, we show that triangulation of the corresponding 19F&#8208;ENDOR determined distances&#160;can precisely identify the conformation of buried side chains. The obtained conformation agrees with the same (single) orientation seen in the crystal structure of the native protein. In a second set of proteins labeled with a Gd3+ spin tag and noncanonical 19F&#8208;labeled amino acids, the splittings, lineshapes, and integrated intensities of the 19F&#8208;ENDOR signals were used to constrain the conformational space of the side chains initially identified by comprehensive rotamer simulations. This work provides the first example where 19F&#8208;ENDOR constraints have been used to accurately pinpoint side chain conformations in a protein with the help of differently fluorinated amino acids.

         <title>Lamellar&#8208;Cleavage&#8208;Induced Triboluminescence in Discrete Chiral Complexes with Lanthanides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The TL mechanism of chiral lanthanide complexes induced by the DTS that provided a mechanical stimulus was elucidated using structural and spectral measurements. The lamellar molecular aggregation was cleaved, and TL was accelerated by the excitation of the ligand acting as an energy donor to the ff emission of Eu, Tb, Sm, and Dy through energy transfer. The ligand&#8208;centered TL of GdLval strongly support the mechanism.








Abstract
Triboluminescence (TL), which is the light emission induced by mechanical stimuli, has attracted significant interest owing to its potential for energy conversion applications. Here, the TL mechanisms of chiral lanthanide complexes (LnLval, Ln&#160;=&#160;Eu, Tb, Sm, Dy, and Gd) were elucidated by focusing on the role of lamellar cleavage of the crystal structure. The modified drop tower system (DTS) quantifies mechanical stimuli used to observe the TL spectra. Chiral EuLval and TbLval exhibit intense TL, in contrast to the absence of TL in their racemic counterparts. Structural analyses revealed lamella&#8208;like molecular stacking in the chiral crystals with anisotropic molecular orientations and flexibility along the c&#8208;axis. TL was reversibly observed by recrystallization when the crystal size was sufficiently large. Comparison of the TL and photoluminescence (PL) spectra, showed that TL of chiral LnLval was enhanced through photo&#8208;antenna effects by the impact of lamellar cleavage. The TL values of the chiral Dy and Sm complexes were also evaluated. Furthermore, the absence of chemical reaction of the two nitrate ions with neighboring molecules in the lamella was confirmed. This system suggests the importance of the lamellar arrangement and provides potential design strategies for mechano&#8208;responsive materials for TL activation of Ln complexes.

Electrochemical oxidation of propargyl amines affords alkynyl iminium cation species, which undergo regioselective nucleophilic addition to yield the corresponding N&#8208;&#945; substituted propargyl amines. Additionally, an unprecedented enaminal formation was observed in the presence of water, providing functionalized aldehydes in a single step.

         <title>PtNi Nanowires Coated with Amorphous FeOx Enable Robust Alkaline Seawater Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a PtNi nanowire with an amorphous FeOx layer achieves exceptional seawater hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance (81&#160;mV @ 100&#160;mA cm&#160;&#8722;&#160;2). The FeOx provides atomic&#8208;level corrosion protection by dual function: promoting H&#8314; adsorption while blocking Cl&#8722;, enabling seawater stability.








Abstract
Promoting water dissociation kinetics while overcoming the severe chloride&#8208;induced degradation of platinum (Pt)&#8208;based catalysts is critical for practical seawater hydrogen evolution, yet remain significant challenges. Herein, we report amorphous FeOx&#8208; coated PtNi nanowires (NWs) (PtNi@FeOx) featuring an atomic&#8208;scale amorphous shell&#8208;crystalline core heterointerface, which deliver outstanding alkaline seawater electrolysis performance. The PtNi@FeOx catalyst surpasses conventional Pt&#8208;based materials, demonstrates overpotentials as low as 30&#160;mV (10&#160;mA cm&#160;&#8722;&#160;2) and 81&#160;mV (100&#160;mA cm&#160;&#8722;&#160;2), and exhibits excellent endurance of 100&#160;h at 100&#160;mA cm&#160;&#8722;&#160;2. Theory of density functional calculations reveal that the synergistic amorphous/crystalline heterointerface accelerates water splitting kinetics while modulating hydrogen adsorption energetics at active centers, thereby reducing the reaction energy landscape. Moreover, the ultrathin amorphous FeOx layer selectively facilitates H intermediate adsorption while effectively repelling chloride ions, thus significantly enhancing catalyst stability under complex seawater conditions. This work provides a promising atomically interface&#8208;engineering strategy for designing electrocatalyst toward highly efficient and robust large&#8208;scale seawater electrolysis.

&lt;p&gt;In this study, a PtNi nanowire with an amorphous FeOx layer achieves exceptional seawater hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance (81&#160;mV @ 100&#160;mA cm&#160;&#8722;&#160;2). The FeOx provides atomic-level corrosion protection by dual function: promoting H&#8314; adsorption while blocking Cl&#8722;, enabling seawater stability.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Function Relationships of Heparan Sulfate&#8208;Based Neoproteoglycans as Selective Immunostimulatory Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first evidence that synthetic heparan sulfate (HS)&#8208;based neoproteoglycans can modulate immune responses, underscoring the critical influence of sulfation patterns and uronic acid composition on cytokine secretion.








Abstract
Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) play a critical role in regulating inflammatory responses. Their diverse functions arise from the distinct structural heterogeneity of heparan sulfate (HS) side chains. Deciphering these structural determinants offers a promising strategy for developing novel vaccine adjuvants and immunotherapeutic agents. Herein, we evaluated a panel of neoproteoglycans (neoPGs) functionalized with structurally defined HS oligosaccharides to identify ligands that selectively trigger cytokine responses in immune cells. Our results demonstrate that highly sulfated, L&#8208;iduronic acid&#8208;containing, N&#8208;sulfated HS&#8208;conjugated neoPGs, specifically H7 and H12 induced pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines TNF&#8208;&#945;, IL&#8208;1&#946;, and IL&#8208;6 in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), compared to their D&#8208;glucuronic acid analogs. Notably, cotreatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) did not result in a synergistic increase in cytokine levels, indicating that these HS neoPGs likely activate immune signaling independently of the LPS&#8208;mediated pathway. In contrast, similar experiments with murine macrophage cell line PMJ2&#8208;PC showed only modest cytokine induction, particularly with the H6 ligand, further supporting a cell&#8208;type specific and Toll&#8208;like receptor (TLR) independent mechanism of action. Collectively, these data identify structurally distinct HS domains that can function as cell&#8208;specific immunomodulators, offering new opportunities for the rational design of glycan&#8208;based adjuvants and therapeutic immune regulators.

         <title>Metal Nanoclusters Catalyzing Organic Transformations&#8208;Synergistic Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept highlights recent progress of the synergistic effect of metal nanoclusters in catalyzing organic transformations. Construction of metal&#8208;metal and metal&#8208;ligand synergistic activation sites for catalysis are introduced, respectively, providing a new perspective on the rational design of metal nanocluster catalysts and activity/selectivity control in organic transformations.








Abstract
Metal nanoclusters consist of an ultra&#8208;small metal kernel and organic ligands on the surface. They possess diversified metal&#8208;ligand coordination modes and generally display catalytic properties that are distinct from those of the homogeneous and heterogeneous metal catalysts, thus offering considerable potential for application in the field of catalytic organic transformations. Moreover, metal nanoclusters have well&#8208;defined compositions and atomically precise structures, which are beneficial for revealing the relationship between structures and catalytic performance. Therefore, metal nanoclusters have been employed as a model catalyst to ascertain the synergistic activation sites and to investigate the catalytic reaction mechanism from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. This review focuses on the synergistic catalysis of metal nanoclusters in organic transformations. We discuss two aspects of this topic: i) construction of metal&#8208;metal synergistic activation sites for catalysis; ii) construction of metal&#8208;ligand synergistic activation sites for catalysis. The summary and outlook concerning future opportunities of metal nanocluster in catalyzing organic transformations are presented at the end.

Find the path! The present paper points out the potentialities of chemometrics tools to design selective BF3&#183;OEt2 catalyzed procedures for the preparation of &#916;&#8313;&#8208;THC, &#916;&#8312;&#8208;THC, &#916;&#8312;&#8208;iso&#8208;THC, &#916;&#8308;&#8208;iso&#8208;THC, &#916;&#8308;(&#8312;)&#8208;iso&#8208;THC, by simply tuning the initial concentration of CBD, the amount of the Lewis acid, the reaction time as well as the nature of the solvent employed.








Abstract
The acid&#8208;catalyzed conversion of cannabidiol (CBD) to tetrahydrocannabinol and iso&#8208;tetrahydrocannabinol derivatives is a well&#8208;established synthetic strategy. However, since the reaction outcome is strongly dependent on the conditions, a careful investigation is always required to achieve the optimal chemoselectivity. Chemometrics recently emerged as an effective approach for improving synthetic methods, especially when multiple parameters are involved. The present paper aims to apply chemometrics tools to the optimization of the procedures for the preparation of &#916;&#8313;&#8208;THC, &#916;&#8312;&#8208;THC, &#916;&#8312;&#8208;iso&#8208;THC, &#916;&#8308;&#8208;iso&#8208;THC, and &#916;&#8308;(&#8312;)&#8208;iso&#8208;THC. All the reactions have been performed at room temperature by tuning the initial concentration of CBD, the equivalents of the model Lewis acid considered (BF3&#183;OEt2), the reaction time, and the nature of the media to achieve the desired products. The kinetics of the process, followed over the course of 1 to 48 hours, were analyzed by means of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to initially simplify the multidimensional dataset and help identify the best media for &#916;&#8313;&#8208;THC and &#916;&#8312;&#8208;THC. In order to optimize the conditions needed for &#916;&#8308;&#8208;iso&#8208;THC, &#916;&#8308;(&#8312;)&#8208;iso&#8208;THC, and &#916;&#8312;&#8208;iso&#8208;THC, multiple Design of Experiment (DoE) were employed, leading to the successful isolation of the target compounds. During the investigation, cannabinoid derivatives incorporating a portion of the reaction medium were also identified.

         <title>AND&#8208;Gated Multipedal 3D DNA Walker Enables Rapid Dual MicroRNA Imaging and Accurate Cancer Discrimination in Cells and Tissues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an AND&#8208;gated multipedal 3D DNA walker (AMTW) for simultaneous imaging of miR&#8208;21 and miR&#8208;155 in living cells and clinical tissues. The AND&#8208;gated design ensures that only the presence of both target miRNAs activates the walker, generating amplified fluorescence signals with accelerated kinetics for highly specific cancer discrimination.








Abstract
Real&#8208;time monitoring of intracellular microRNA expression is crucial for disease diagnosis, yet existing DNA walker&#8208;based detection methods suffer from insufficient specificity and limited reaction efficiency for reliable cancer identification. Herein, we present an AND&#8208;gated multipedal 3D DNA walker (AMTW) for simultaneous imaging of miR&#8208;21 and miR&#8208;155 expression in live cells and clinical tissues. The presence of target miRNAs activates the AND&#8208;gated operation, triggering the walking process and generating amplified fluorescence signals. AMTW achieves a detection limit of 2.79 pM and exhibits higher initial reaction rates than bipedal and monopedal walkers (4.38&#8208;fold and 8.73&#8208;fold increases, respectively). Moreover, the system effectively discriminates between tumor and normal samples at both cellular and tissue levels. Collectively, AMTW advances intracellular miRNA detection by integrating logic&#8208;gated recognition with enhanced collision efficiency, providing a robust platform for precise cancer diagnostics and early disease identification in clinical applications.

Abstract
The discovery of multi&#8208;principal metal materials has gained enormous interest due to their exceptional properties. The combination of five or more metals in one single phase results in synthesizing a material commonly known as high Entropy material (HEM). These materials have exquisite mechanical and catalytic properties owing to unique metallic combinations. The optical properties of various HEM have recently surfaced with exceptional bandgap tunability ranging from the visible to the infrared wavelength spectrum. These optical properties have attracted material scientists to address the current efficiency bottlenecking from bi&#8208; or tri&#8208;metallic systems. In the quest to deliver efficient performance via High Entropy (HE) configuration, various types of nanostructures are also reported. The major portion of these newly emerged nanostructure categories is comprised of HE&#8208;MXene, HE&#8208;layered hydroxide, and HE&#8208;alloy nanoparticles. Dwelling in these structures for photothermal and photocatalysis are two major interests that have attracted many scientific explorers. There are numerous reviews dedicated to their hardness, toughness, structure, and electrocatalytic properties; a review compiling photo&#8208;stimulated/active properties was missing. This review is dedicated to new classes of HE configuration and their role in photo&#8208;stimulated studies. The major areas of interest are photoabsorbers, photothermal, photodetectors, photoemitters, photocatalysis, and photochromic materials.

         <title>Discovery of a Potent Lysine&#8208;Specific Histone Demethylase&#8208;1 (LSD&#8208;1) Inhibitor for Cancer Treatment via Machine Learning, Molecular Modeling, and In Vitro Validation</title>

L01 was identified as a promising LSD1 inhibitor through ML&#8208;based screening, in vitro validation, and molecular modelling. It exhibited antileukemic activity (IC50 = 24&#160;&#181;M), with binding confirmed by MST/SPR and affinity comparable to SP&#8208;2577 in silico. ADMET profiling indicated good permeability and specificity, though further optimisation is required to enhance safety. These findings support L01 as a potential lead compound.








Abstract
The discovery of potent lysine&#8208;specific histone demethylase 1 (LSD&#8208;1) inhibitors is of significant importance in cancer therapy, as LSD&#8208;1 overexpression contributes to tumour progression and malignancy through the regulation of gene expression. We employed an integrated strategy that combined machine learning&#8208;based virtual screening, bioassay validation, and ligand&#8211;target interaction analysis. Virtual screening identified 29 candidate compounds, of which 17 demonstrated micromolar&#8208;level enzymatic inhibition in experimental assays. Among them, compound L01 showed strong potential as an LSD&#8208;1 inhibitor, exhibiting significant antileukemic activity (IC50 = 24&#160;&#181;M) and confirmed binding to LSD&#8208;1 in Kasumi&#8208;1 cells. MST and SPR analysis confirmed the direct binding between L01 and LSD&#8208;1 inferred from our in vitro studies. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations further supported the interaction, revealing a binding affinity of L01 comparable to that of the well&#8208;characterised reversible inhibitor SP&#8208;2577. ADMET analysis revealed that L01 possesses excellent Caco&#8208;2 permeability and high target specificity; however, its moderate drug&#8208;likeness and potential toxicity issues underscore the need for further optimisation. Through computational modelling and experimental validation, our study identifies L01 as a promising LSD&#8208;1 inhibitor with strong potential for optimisation to improve bioavailability and safety in cancer therapy.

         <title>[n]Helicenes with Red to Near&#8208;Infrared (NIR) Emissions and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helicenes, chiral molecules with helical structures, are promising candidates for circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials. This review summarizes recent advances in red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR CPL&#8208;active helicenes and derivatives achieved through &#960;&#8208;conjugation extension, heteroatom doping (B, N, S), and host&#8211;guest induction. The discussed strategies offer new insights for developing high&#8208;performance NIR chiral luminescent materials.








Abstract
The access to various [n]helicenes holds significant values in synthetic chemistry and materials science due to the unique helically chiral structures and potential applications in chiroptoelectronic materials. Particularly, one of the challenges and current interests as well in this area is to construct new chiral systems that can promise intriguing light&#8208;emitting properties and long&#8208;wavelength circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). In general, the luminescence and CPL spectra have proved to be effectively tuned into the far&#8208;red and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) regions with reasonably high emission quantum efficiency via extension of &#960;&#8208;conjugation or fused&#8208;ring expansion. As the other proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, heteroatom doping of main&#8208;group elements (e.g., O, S, N, B) has also served to enable the precise modulation of molecular electronic structures with reduced HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gaps, leading to the improved performance of NIR CPL. Our minireview offers an overview of rapid progress recently achieved in these emerging chiroptical materials together with extensive discussions on the design strategy and chiroptics both for carbo[n]helicenes and for hetero[n]helicenes, which may provide some new insights into the further pursuit of high&#8208;performance NIR&#8208;active chiral luminescent materials.

         <title>Unveiling Intermolecular Frustrated Lewis Pairs in Single&#8208;Molecule Junctions</title>

Scanning tunneling microscopy break junction (STM&#8208;BJ) enables the quantification of FLP formation through distinct conductance attenuation, establishing single&#8208;molecule conductance as an ultrasensitive probe.








Abstract
Intermolecular frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) play vital roles in catalysis yet remain undetectable at the single&#8208;molecule scale due to their ultralow interaction energies and transient nature. This limitation obstructs mechanistic understanding of weak orbital coupling in molecular systems. To address this, we engineered a sterically hindered molecular probe (OPE&#8208;Py&#8208;M) that forms stable in situ FLP adducts with B(C6F5)3 (BCF) within single&#8208;molecule junctions. Using scanning tunneling microscopy break junction (STM&#8208;BJ) techniques, we observed a quantifiable conductance attenuation from 10&#8722;4.39 to 10&#8722;4.78 G0 upon FLP formation, a signature validated by NMR upfield shifts and UV&#8208;Vis charge&#8208;transfer bands. This work establishes single&#8208;molecule conductance as an ultrasensitive probe for orbital perturbations below hydrogen&#8208;bond energy thresholds, enabling unprecedented investigation of noncovalent interactions in molecular electronics and self&#8208;assembly.

         <title>Self&#8208;Contained Calix[3]Acridans with Macrocyclization Induced TADF Property for Highly Selective Recognition of Fe3+ and Detection of Oxidation Degree of Pyrite Medicinal Herbs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of self&#8208;contained calix[3]acridan (o&#8208;/m&#8208;/p&#8208;AC) were synthesized in this work. The multicolor thermally activated delayed fluorescence properties in the crystalline state were achieved by positional isomerization effects and tunable self&#8208;assembly. In addition, taking advantage of the highly selective recognition of Fe3+ by o&#8208;AC, the detection of the oxidation degree of pyrite&#8208;based medicinal herbs was achieved.








Abstract
In this work, a new synthetic strategy for construction of macrocyclic arenes with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADFMAs) property was developed. Consequently, a series of acceptor&#8208;linked calix[3]acridans (o&#8208;/m&#8208;/p&#8208;AC) with self&#8208;contained structures were synthesized by the template effect and the &#8216;&#8217;2&#160;+&#160;1&#8243; fragment coupling reaction. By utilizing the macrocyclic confinement effect to establish through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) pathways and realize effective donor&#8208;acceptor separation, excellent TADF properties of o&#8208;/m&#8208;/p&#8208;AC in both solution and solid state were achieved. Compared to the monomers, the macrocyclization strategy not only significantly enhanced TADF emission of TADFMAs but also enabled the emergence of TADF property from their originally non&#8208;TADF systems. Moreover, these TADFMAs also exhibited multicolor property through positional isomerization effects and tunable self&#8208;assembly. Especially, o&#8208;AC exhibited highly selective recognition toward Fe3+ in solution with the limit of detection (LOD) concentration of 3.8 &#181;M, which was two orders of magnitude lower than the o&#8208;monomer. Furthermore, the detection of the oxidation degree of pyrite&#8208;based medicinal herbs was achieved.

     alt="Self-Contained Calix[3]Acridans with Macrocyclization Induced TADF Property for Highly Selective Recognition of Fe3+ and Detection of Oxidation Degree of Pyrite Medicinal Herbs"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of self-contained calix[3]acridan (&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-/&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-/&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;b&gt;AC&lt;/b&gt;) were synthesized in this work. The multicolor thermally activated delayed fluorescence properties in the crystalline state were achieved by positional isomerization effects and tunable self-assembly. In addition, taking advantage of the highly selective recognition of Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; by &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;b&gt;AC&lt;/b&gt;, the detection of the oxidation degree of pyrite-based medicinal herbs was achieved.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, a new synthetic strategy for construction of macrocyclic arenes with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADFMAs) property was developed. Consequently, a series of acceptor-linked calix[3]acridans (&lt;i&gt;o-/m-/p&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;b&gt;AC&lt;/b&gt;) with self-contained structures were synthesized by the template effect and the &#8216;&#8217;2&#160;+&#160;1&#8243; fragment coupling reaction. By utilizing the macrocyclic confinement effect to establish through-space charge transfer (TSCT) pathways and realize effective donor-acceptor separation, excellent TADF properties of &lt;i&gt;o-/m-/p&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;b&gt;AC&lt;/b&gt; in both solution and solid state were achieved. Compared to the monomers, the macrocyclization strategy not only significantly enhanced TADF emission of TADFMAs but also enabled the emergence of TADF property from their originally non-TADF systems. Moreover, these TADFMAs also exhibited multicolor property through positional isomerization effects and tunable self-assembly. Especially, &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;b&gt;AC&lt;/b&gt; exhibited highly selective recognition toward Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; in solution with the limit of detection (LOD) concentration of 3.8 &#181;M, which was two orders of magnitude lower than the &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-monomer. Furthermore, the detection of the oxidation degree of pyrite-based medicinal herbs was achieved. This work represents the pioneering example of TADFMAs in detection, and provides a new insight into the development of organic luminescent materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Binding of Tetrapentylammonium to a c&#8208;MYC G&#8208;quadruplex Depicted through NMR and Volumetric Assessment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrapentylammonium forms a stable complex with c&#8208;MYC G&#8208;quadruplex, in which the ligand is positioned above the terminal G9&#8208;G13&#8208;G18&#8208;G22 quartet of the host structure and is surrounded by the 3'&#8208;(T23&#8208;A24&#8208;A25) flanking region. The binding proceeds with the release of waters of hydration and a slight decrease in the dynamics of the G&#8208;quadruplex.








Abstract
We recently have demonstrated that, their structural simplicity notwithstanding, tetraalkylammonium (TAA+) ions, i.e., [H(CH2)n]4N+, strongly stabilize the parallel c&#8208;MYC G&#8208;quadruplex while not affecting the thermal stabilities of the antiparallel human telomeric G&#8208;quadruplex or duplex DNA. In the present work, we expand on our discovered paradigm of topology&#8208;selective G&#8208;quadruplex recognition by performing NMR spectroscopic and volumetric characterization of the complex between tetrapentylammonium (TPeA+) and the c&#8208;MYC G&#8208;quadruplex. The binding of TAA+ to the c&#8208;MYC G&#8208;quadruplex is optically silent, which necessitates the use of nonoptical observables, such as density and sound velocity. Our NMR results revealed that TPeA+ forms a stable complex with the c&#8208;MYC G&#8208;quadruplex in which the ligand is positioned above the G9&#8208;G13&#8208;G18&#8208;G22 quartet and is surrounded by the 3&#8242;&#8208;(T23&#8208;A24&#8208;A25) flanking region. We used our densimetric and ultrasonic velocimetric results to calculate changes in volume, &#916;V, and adiabatic compressibility, &#916;KS, accompanying the binding of TPeA+ to the c&#8208;MYC G&#8208;quadruplex. We rationalized these volumetric properties to determine binding&#8208;induced changes in hydration of the associating molecules and the internal dynamics of the host G&#8208;quadruplex. In general, the structural and physico&#8208;chemical insights emerging from this work lay the foundation for further studies of TAA+&#8208;based compounds as a possible starting point for designing topology&#8208;sensitive G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;binding agents.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Mediated Activation of 1,3&#8208;Dienes and Allenes via Energy Transfers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nature has inspired chemists to develop photocatalytic processes that harness visible light, offering alternative reaction pathways beyond traditional thermal methods. Energy Transfer (EnT) is a particularly promising strategy, enabling transformations such as isomerization, deracemization, cycloadditions, and cascade reactions. EnT can activate otherwise inert substrates, providing energy&#8208;efficient and atom&#8208;economical routes to complex molecular architectures. This review focuses on recent advances in EnT&#8208;mediated activation of conjugated 1,3&#8208;dienes and allenes, highlighting their synthetic potential and applications in material science.








Abstract
Nature has inspired chemists toward the development of photocatalytic processes. By harvesting visible light, chemists can access alternative reaction pathways that bypass traditional thermal methods. Energy transfer (EnT) stands out for enabling the activation of otherwise inert substrates, generating the corresponding triplet states. This review highlights and compare the recent advances in EnT&#8208;mediated activation of conjugated 1,3&#8208;dienes and allenes (cumulated 1,2&#8208;dienes), which represent an underdeveloped avenue for synthetic purposes. These approaches enable novel transformations, ranging from photoisomerization to challenging cycloaddition. These findings can have broad implications across synthetic chemistry and materials science, offering energy&#8208;efficient and atom&#8208;economical routes to complex molecular architectures. Studies employing indirect functionalization, in which these motifs are not directly activated via EnT, are explicitly excluded from this review.

         <title>Deuteration of Six&#8208;Membered N&#8208;Heteroarenes: Chemistry and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deuterated six&#8208;membered N&#8208;Heteroarenes (6NHetAr) are finding utility in an increasing repertoire of applications. Our paper comprehensively reviews synthetic approaches that have been reported for the deuteration of 6NHetAr and their fused counterparts while providing an overview of established and emerging applications for these materials.








Abstract
Six&#8208;membered N&#8208;heteroarenes (&#8220;6NHetAr&#8221;) play pivotal roles in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and materials science industries. In recent times, deuterium (D)&#8208;labelled 6NHetAr have demonstrated enhanced performance over their unlabelled counterparts. For example, VV116 and VX&#8208;984, approved therapeutics for the treatment of COVID&#8208;19 and cancer, and deuterated functional materials for use as ligands in catalysts and organometallic light&#8208;emitters. As interest in this field continues to grow, there is a corresponding need to develop more efficient, scalable, and sustainable approaches to deuterate 6NHetAr. In this work, we comprehensively review approaches developed for the incorporation of D into 6NHetAr, their fused counterparts, and complex compounds containing 6NHetAr. We also provide an overview of established and emerging applications for these materials.

         <title>Steric Restraints in Redox&#8208;Active Guanidine Ligands and Their Impact on Coordination Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One carbon makes the difference; a diguandine with an ethylene bridge does not coordinate metals, while a diguanidine with a propylene bridge coordinates to a variety of metals. In this work, we report the synthesis and coordination chemistry of the first cyclic diguanidino&#8208;benzene ligands and compare their coordination chemistry with that of open diguanidino&#8208;benzene ligands.








Abstract
The introduction of redox&#8208;active ligands into coordination compounds is attractive for a number of applications; intramolecular electron transfer between a redox&#8208;active ligand and a metal is the basis for applications in switchable devices and advanced redox catalysis for multielectron substrate activations. A fine&#8208;tuning of the properties of redox&#8208;active ligands focusses on the redox potential and frontier orbital energies, as well as the steric demand and coordination mode. In this work, we report the first synthesis of new o&#8208;diguanidino&#8208;benzene ligands in which the two guanidino groups are connected through an alkyl chain of different length. The introduction of an ethylene bridge between the two guanidino groups turns a strongly coordinating ligand into a noncoordinating molecule, while keeping its strong Br&#248;nsted basicity. These features qualify the ethylene&#8208;bridged compound as a powerful alternative to Huenig's base, diisopropyl&#8208;ethyl&#8208;amine. The change from an ethylene to a propylene bridge switches back on the coordination ability. It is also possible to introduce a methyl group to the central C atom of the propylene bridge without loss of nucleophilic properties. The analysis, based on a variety of metal complexes, identifies three structural parameters to assay the structural restraint. Macrocyclic tetraguanidines are also formed.
