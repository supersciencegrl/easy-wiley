N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene&#8208;phosphinidene complexes can be conceived as new and true members of the class of nucleophilic phosphinidene complexes according to their spectroscopic, structural, and electronic properties, since substitution of the aryl moiety in authentic neutral arylphosphinidene complexes of the type [ArP=MLn] by an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene affords the corresponding cationic complexes [(NHC)P=MLn]+ with equally short and covalent metal&#8211;phosphorus double bonds. More information can be found in the Full Paper by A. Doddi, M. Tamm, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202003099).

      <title>Control of Axial Chirality by Planar Chirality Based on Optically Active [2.2]Paracyclophane</title>
      <dc:description>
Chiral X&#8208;shaped molecules based on the planar chiral [2.2]paracyclophane have been prepared, in which di(methoxy)terphenyl units are stacked on the central benzene rings. At 25&#8201;&#176;C, methoxyphenyl rings freely rotate in solution, while at &#8722;120&#8201;&#176;C, their rotary motion is suppressed in the excited state. The X&#8208;shaped molecules emit CPL at 25&#8201;&#176;C in solution with a large glum value. On the other hand, at &#8722;120&#8201;&#176;C, dual CPL emission with opposite signs is observed. The axial chirality is controlled by the planar chirality at low temperature, leading ultimately to propeller chirality. More information can be found in the Full Paper by Y. Morisaki et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202003188).

      <dc:description>
Light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells have been fabricated for the first time from graphene quantum dots (GQDs) sandwiched by ITO and Al electrodes, to display a broad and strong white emission. The GQDs have been fabricated in gram scale from electrochemical exfoliation of graphite and studied in electrochemiluminescence to gain insight into their optoelectronic characteristics. It is anticipated to use the GQDs in lighting applications. More information can be found in the Full Paper by Z. Ding et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202003395).

      <dc:description>
Three birds with one stone: New therapies are needed to facilitate synergistic combinations that span distinct antitumor mechanisms. A small library of structurally relevant C,N&#8208;cyclometalated ruthenium(II) complexes was synthesized and their pharmacologic efficacy was investigated. The cover art shows the structure of the complex Ru8, which was demonstrated to have three antitumor functions, including potent cytotoxicity, antimetastasis and antivascular activity. The complex deserves further investigation as a promising drug candidate to combat metastatic cancer. More information can be found in the Full Paper by C. Chen, H. Wang, et&#8197;al.

      <title>Natural Polyphenol&#8211;Vanadium Oxide Nanozymes for Synergistic Chemodynamic/Photothermal Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
One&#8208;step assembly of tannic acid and metavanadate led to the formation of a type of nanozyme comprising natural polyphenol&#8208;hybrided mixed valence vanadium oxide nanosheets (TA@VOx NSs). In this nanosystem, the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of VOx provides the possibility to achieve tumor&#8208;specific chemodynamic therapy (CDT). As a valid supplement to CDT, NIR absorption ensures that TA@VOx NSs can realize NIR light&#8208;mediated photothermal therapy (PTT). Such combination of chemodynamic and photothermal activities means that TA@VOx NSs can be applied for effective synergistic CDT/PTT of cancers. More information can be found in the Full Paper by X.&#8208;C. Shen, B.&#8208;P. Jiang, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202002335).

      <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Heptacene Generation under Ambient Conditions: Utilization of a Single&#8208;Crystal Interior as an Isolated Reaction Site</title>
      <dc:description>
The visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced conversion of heptacene precursors to heptacene is described. The photoirradiation of the inner region of a mono&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diketone&#8208;type heptacene precursor crystal resulted in characteristic heptacene absorption peaks, indicating that the single&#8208;crystal interior provided a reaction site isolated from the external environment thus preventing oxidation of unstable products. More information can be found in the Communication by H. Hayashi, S. Masuo, H. Yamada, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202002155).

      <title>Tetrazole Azasydnone (C2N7O2H) and Its Salts: High&#8208;Performing Zwitterionic Energetic Materials Containing a Unique Explosophore</title>
      <dc:description>
The first compound containing both a tetrazole and an azasydnone ring, a unique energetic material, is reported. Several energetic salts of the tetrazole azasydnone were synthesized and characterized, leading to the creation of new secondary and primary explosives. Molecular structures are confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR, IR spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. The high heats of formation, fast detonation velocities, and straightforward synthesis of energetic azasydnones should capture the attention of future energetics research.

      <title>Study of excited states and electron transfer of semiconductor&#8208;metal&#8208;complex hybrid photocatalysts for CO2 reduction using picosecond time&#8208;resolved spectroscopies</title>
      <dc:description>We have previously reported on a semiconductor&#8208;metal&#8208;complex hybrid photocatalyst for CO2 reduction composed of nitrogen&#8208;doped Ta2O5 as a semiconductor photosensitizer and Ru complex as a CO2 reduction catalyst that operates under visible light (&gt; 400 nm) with high selectivity for HCOOH formation of more than 75 %. The electron transfer from a photoactive semiconductor to the metal&#8208;complex catalyst is a key process for photocatalytic CO2 reduction with hybrid photocatalysts. To understand the mechanism of electron transfer from a semiconductor to the metal&#8208;complex catalyst, here we describe the excited&#8208;state dynamics of several hybrid photocatalysts using time&#8208;resolved emission and infrared absorption spectroscopies. Our results show that electron transfer from the semiconductor to the metal&#8208;complex catalyst does not directly occur upon photoexcitation, but that the photoexcited electron transfers to a new excited state. Based on the present results and previous reports, we suggest that the excited state is a charge transfer state located between shallow defects of the semiconductor and the metal&#8208;complex catalyst.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis, Electronic Properties and Reactivity of [B12X11(NO2)]2&#8722; (X=F&#8211;I) Dianions</title>
      <dc:description>
Improved electrochemical stability. The [B12X11(NO2)]2&#8722; (X=F&#8211;I) dianions show an improved electrochemical stability compared to the parent [B12X12]2&#8722; anions but thermally cleave NO to give very reactive [B12X11O]2&#8722;. radical dianions.







Abstract
Nitro&#8208;functionalized undecahalogenated closo&#8208;dodecaborates [B12X11(NO2)]2&#8722; were synthesized in high purities and characterized by NMR, IR, and Raman spectroscopy, single crystal X&#8208;diffraction, mass spectrometry, and gas&#8208;phase ion vibrational spectroscopy. The NO2 substituent leads to an enhanced electronic and electrochemical stability compared to the parent perhalogenated [B12X12]2&#8722; (X=F&#8211;I) dianions evidenced by photoelectron spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. The stabilizing effect decreases from X=F to X=I. Thermogravimetric measurements of the salts indicate the loss of the nitric oxide radical (NO.). The homolytic NO. elimination from the dianion under very soft collisional excitation in gas&#8208;phase ion experiments results in the formation of the radical [B12X11O]2&#8722;.. Theoretical investigations suggest that the loss of NO. proceeds via the rearrangement product [B12X11(ONO)]2&#8722;. The O&#8208;bonded nitrosooxy structure is thermodynamically more stable than the N&#8208;bonded nitro structure and its formation by radical recombination of [B12X11O]2&#8722;. and NO. is demonstrated.

The homolytic NO&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt; elimination from the dianion under very soft collisional excitation in gas&#8208;phase ion experiments results in the formation of the radical [B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;O]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;.&lt;/sup&gt;. Theoretical investigations suggest that the loss of NO&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt; proceeds via the rearrangement product [B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;(ONO)]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. The &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;bonded nitrosooxy structure is thermodynamically more stable than the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;bonded nitro structure and its formation by radical recombination of [B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;O]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;.&lt;/sup&gt; and NO&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt; is demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Synthesis, structure and properties of an extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore aluminosilicate zeolite NUD&#8208;6</title>
      <dc:description>Pure silica zeolites possessing uniform micropores, large surface area and high thermal and chemical stability have been widely studied and used in the fields of fine chemicals and oil industry. The incorporation of Al into the framework of silica zeolites changes their properties, making them more industrially useful as adsorbents and catalysts. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of an extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore aluminosilicate zeolite NUD&#8208;6 with a 16&#8208;membered&#8208;ring pore channel. The Al was directly incorporated into the zeolite NUD&#8208;6 framework, which was confirmed by  27  Al MAS NMR studies and ammonia temperature&#8208;programmed desorption probes. Al&#8208;NUD&#8208;6 was not stable when heated at 550&#176;C to remove the organic templates. However, the organic templates in Al&#8208;NUD&#8208;6 could be removed by oxidation in nitric acid at room temperature. The obtained Al&#8208;NUD&#8208;6H retained the crystalline structure and possessed both micropores and mesopores despite the occurrence of severe structural distortions due to the presence of the corner&#8208;sharing Q  3  Si  2  O  7  units.

      <title>A Carboxyl&#8208;Functionalized Covalent Organic Framework Synthesized in a Deep Eutectic Solvent for Dye Adsorption</title>
      <dc:description>Instead of the use of organic solvents, a deep eutectic solvent (DES) composed of tetrabutylammonium bromide and imidazole (Bu 4  NBr/Im) was employed as a solvent for the first time to synthesize covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Due to the low vapor pressure of the Bu 4  NBr/Im&#8208;based DES, a new carboxyl&#8208;functionalized COF (TpPa&#8208;COOH) was synthesized under the environmental pressure. The as&#8208;synthesized TpPa&#8208;COOH has open channels and the DES can be removed completely from the pores. The dye adsorption performance of TpPa&#8208;COOH was examined for three organic dyes with similar molecular sizes, including one anionic dye (eosin B, EB) and two cationic dyes (methylene blue, MB; safranine T, ST). TpPa&#8208;COOH showed an excellent selective adsorption effect on MB and ST. The electronegative keto form in TpPa&#8208;COOH may help to form electrostatic and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between the &#960;&#8211;stacking frameworks of TpPa&#8208;COOH and the positive plane MB and ST molecules. The adsorption isotherms of MB and ST on TpPa&#8208;COOH were further investigated in detail and the equilibrium adsorption was well&#8208;modeled by using Langmuir isotherm model. Together with hydrogen bonding, TpPa&#8208;COOH showed higher adsorption capacity for ST than that for MB (1135 vs 410 mg/g). These results could provide a guidance for the green synthesis of adsorbents in removing organic dyes from wastewater.</dc:description>

      <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence from d10 Metal Carbene Complexes via Intermolecular Charge Transfer and Multicolor Emission with a Monomer&#8208;Dimer Equilibrium</title>
      <dc:description>We report a series of two&#8208;coordinate Au(I) and Cu(I) complexes (3a&#8211;3b and 5a&#8211;5b) as new organometallic thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters, which were based on the carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;carbazole model with pyridine&#8208;fused&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazolylidene (PyTz) ligand. The PyTz features small steric hindrance and low&#8208;energy LUMO (LUMO = &#8211;1.47 eV) locating over the &#960;* orbitals of the whole ligand, which facilitates the intermolecular charge transfer (CT) between a donor (carbazole) and an accepter (PyTz). These compounds exhibit efficient TADF with microsecond lifetimes. Temperature&#8208;dependent PL kinetics of 3a supports a rather small energy gap between S1 and T1 (&#916;ES1&#8211;T1 = 60 meV). Further experiments reveal that there exist dual&#8208;emission properties from a monomer&#8208;dimer equilibrium in the solution, exhibiting single&#8208;component multicolor emission from blue to orange including white&#8208;light emission.</dc:description>

      <title>Synergistic Self&#8208;Assembly of Oxoanions and d&#8208;Block Metal Ions with Heteroditopic Receptors into Triple&#8208;Stranded Helicates</title>

      <title>Insights on the Pseudo&#8208;Enantiomeric Properties of Bifunctional Cinchona Alkaloid Squaramide&#8208;derived Organocatalyst</title>
      <dc:description>The use of pseudo enantiomers is a well&#8208;known method of achieving products of complementary stereochemistry. Only rarely can different enantiomers of a product be accessed without modulation of the catalyst. Recently, a system was reported wherein two different enantiomers of spirocycles were obtained by a cascade reaction of unsaturated pyrrolin&#8208;4&#8208;ones with mercaptoacetaldehyde catalyzed by a single optimized cinchona alkaloid squaramide&#8208;derived organocatalyst. It was originally proposed that the  E  &#8208;/  Z  &#8208;geometry of the unsaturated pyrrolin&#8208;4&#8208;one dictated the stereochemistry of the spirocycle product, but this was not investigated further. In the present work, we have investigated the nature of a pseudo&#8208;enantiomeric organocatalyst conformation applying density functional theory calculations for investigating the transition states for the reaction. Furthermore, the influence of the double&#8208;bond geometry of the pyrrolin&#8208;4&#8208;one has been studied beyond what is possible to test experimentally. The results provide a greater understanding for this class of reactions that may be applicable in future methodology development.</dc:description>

Abstract
Naphthalenediimides (NDIs) are privileged scaffolds par excellence, of use in functional systems from catalysts to ion channels, photosystems, sensors, ordered matter in all forms, tubes, knots, stacks, sheets, vesicles, and colored over the full visible range. Despite this extensively explored chemical space, there is still room to discover core&#8208;substituted NDIs with fundamentally new properties: NDIs with cyclic trisulfides (i.e., trisulfanes) in their core absorb at 668&#8197;nm, emit at 801&#8197;nm, and contract into disulfides (i.e., dithietes) upon irradiation at &lt;475&#8197;nm. Intramolecular 1,5&#8208;chalcogen bonds account for record redshifts with trisulfides, ring&#8208;tension mediated chalcogen&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated cleavage for blueshifts to 492&#8197;nm upon ring contraction. Cyclic oligochalcogenides (COCs) in the NDI core open faster than strained dithiolanes as in asparagusic acid and are much better retained on thiol exchange affinity columns. This makes COC&#8208;NDIs attractive not only within the existing multifunctionality, particularly artificial photosystems, but also for thiol&#8208;mediated cellular uptake.

      <title>Stabilization of Black Phosphorus using Sonication&#8208;Assisted Simultaneous Exfoliation&#8208;Functionalization</title>
      <dc:description>Black Phosphorus (BP) displays extraordinary properties but its ambient instability remains a critical challenge. Functionalization has been employed to overcome the sensitivity of BP to ambient conditions while preserving its properties. Here, we report a simultaneous exfoliation&#8208;functionalization process that functionalizes BP flakes during exfoliation, hence providing increased protection which can be attributed to the minimal exposure of flakes to ambient oxygen and water. A tetrabutylammonium salt was employed for the intercalation of BP, resulting in the formation of flakes with large lateral dimensions. The addition of an aryl iodide or an aryl iodonium salt to the exfoliation solvent creates a scalable strategy for the production of functionalized few&#8208;layer BP flakes. The ambient stability of functionalized BP was prolonged to a period of 1 week compared to unfunctionalized BP, as characterized using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and x&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Black Phosphorus (BP) displays extraordinary properties but its ambient instability remains a critical challenge. Functionalization has been employed to overcome the sensitivity of BP to ambient conditions while preserving its properties. Here, we report a simultaneous exfoliation&#8208;functionalization process that functionalizes BP flakes during exfoliation, hence providing increased protection which can be attributed to the minimal exposure of flakes to ambient oxygen and water. A tetrabutylammonium salt was employed for the intercalation of BP, resulting in the formation of flakes with large lateral dimensions. The addition of an aryl iodide or an aryl iodonium salt to the exfoliation solvent creates a scalable strategy for the production of functionalized few&#8208;layer BP flakes. The ambient stability of functionalized BP was prolonged to a period of 1 week compared to unfunctionalized BP, as characterized using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and x&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Manufacturing Reusable NAND Logic Gates and Their Initial Circuits for DNA Nanoprocessors</title>
      <dc:description>Insert abstract text here. DNA&#8208;based computers can potentially analyze complex sets of biological markers, thereby advancing diagnostics and treatment of diseases. Despite extensive efforts, DNA processors have not yet been developed due to, in part, the limitations in ability to integrate available logic gates into circuits. Here, we designed a NAND gate, which represents one of the functionally complete set of logic connectives. The gate&#8217;s design avoids stem&#8208;loop folded DNA fragments, and capable of reusable operations in RNase H&#8208;containing buffer. The output of the gate can be translated in RNA cleaving activity or fluorescent signal produced either by a deoxyribozyme or molecular beacon probe. Furthermore, three NAND gate&#8208;forming DNA strands were cross&#8208;linked by click chemistry and purified in a simple procedure, which allowed manufacturing 10  13  gates in 16 h, with hands&#8208;on time of about 30 min. Two NAND gates can be joined in one association, performing new logic function simply by adding a DNA linker strand. Approaches developed in this work may contribute to the development of biocompatible DNA logic circuits for biotechnological and medical applications</dc:description>

      <title>Building C(sp3) Molecular Complexity on 2,2&#8217;&#8208;Bipyridine and 1,10&#8208;Phenanthroline in Rhenium Tricarbonyl Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>The reactions of [Re(N&#8208;N)(CO)  3  (PMe  3  )]OTf (N&#8208;N= 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine, bipy; 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, phen) compounds with  t  BuLi and with LiHBEt  3  have been explored. Addition to the N&#8208;N chelate took place with different site&#8208;selectivity depending on both chelate and nucleophile. Thus, with  t  BuLi, an unprecedented addition to C5 of bipy, a regiochemistry non&#8208;accessible for free bipy, was obtained, while coordinated phen underwent  t  BuLi addition to C2 and C4. Remarkably, when LiHBEt  3  reacted with [Re(bipy)(CO)  3  (PMe  3  )]OTf, hydride addition to the 4 and 6 positions of bipy triggered an intermolecular cyclodimerization of two dearomatized pyridyl rings. In contrast, hydride addition to the phen analog resulted on partial reduction of one pyridine ring. The resulting neutral Re(I) products showed a varied reactivity with HOTf and with MeOTf to yield cationic complexes. These strategies rendered access to Re(I) complexes containing bipy&#8208; and phen&#8208;derived chelates with several C(sp  3  ) centers.</dc:description>

Hydrogenase enzymes produce H2 naturally, holding promise in the future of H2&#8208;based energy economy. In their review on page&#8197;12494&#8197;ff., S.

      <title>A Local D4h Symmetric Dysprosium(III) Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet with an Energy Barrier Exceeding 2000 K</title>
      <dc:description>Three six&#8208;coordinate Dy(III) single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) [Dy(OtBu)2(L)4]+  with local  D4h  symmetry are obtained by optimising the equatorial ligands. One of the compounds with L = 4&#8208;phenylpyridine shows an energy barrier (Ueff) of 2075(11) K, which is the third largest  Ueff  , and the first  Ueff  &gt; 2000 K for SMMs with axial&#8208;type symmetry so far.  Ab initio  analysis indicates that the exceptional uniaxial magnetic anisotropy is deeply related to the axially compressed octahedral geometry. This work provides a new insight into the local  D4h  symmetry for high&#8208;performance SMMs.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Three six&#8208;coordinate Dy(III) single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) [Dy(OtBu)2(L)4]+  with local  D4h  symmetry are obtained by optimising the equatorial ligands. One of the compounds with L = 4&#8208;phenylpyridine shows an energy barrier (Ueff) of 2075(11) K, which is the third largest  Ueff  , and the first  Ueff  &amp;gt; 2000 K for SMMs with axial&#8208;type symmetry so far.  Ab initio  analysis indicates that the exceptional uniaxial magnetic anisotropy is deeply related to the axially compressed octahedral geometry. This work provides a new insight into the local  D4h  symmetry for high&#8208;performance SMMs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Saccharide Recognition by a Three Arm&#8208;Shaped Host Having Preorganized Three&#8208;Dimensional Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Sites</title>
      <dc:description>Generally, cage&#8208;shaped hosts for saccharides can strongly bind to guest molecules owing to the three&#8208;dimensional preorganized hydrogen&#8208;bonding sites. However, the preparation of cage molecules is often difficult due to the low&#8208;yield macrocyclization step. Here, we report a three arm&#8208;shaped molecule possessing pyridine&#8211;acetylene&#8211;phenol units as a new kind of host having a preorganized three&#8208;dimensional hydrogen&#8208;bonding site. This three arm&#8208;shaped host was readily prepared compared to a cage&#8208;shaped analogue. This host associated with lipophilic glycosides to form chiral complexes, and the association constants were sufficiently high as well as those of the cage&#8208;shaped one. Furthermore, this host extracted native monosaccharides into a lipophilic solvent.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The ability to tune optical features of BODIPY materials in solid state is essential for their photo&#8208;related application and require efficiently control of the crystal packing. In this study, such control of BODIPY supramolecular assemblies was achieved by deliberate design and synthesis a BODIPY containing a strong halogen bond (XB) acceptor (&#8211;NO2) and donor (I, Br) to mediate XB interactions.

These XB interactions promote singlet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet intersystem crossing and triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet reverse intersystem crossing due to delocalization of oxygen electrons partially onto the Br and I, which leads to unexpected fluorescence enhancement of  B4&#8208;II  .

      <title>Synthetically Versatile Nitrogen Acyclic Carbene stabilized Gold Nanoparticles</title>
      <dc:description>N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have received significant attention as gold nanoparticle stabilizers due to their strong binding affinity towards gold. However, their tunability is limited by the difficulty in obtaining nonsymmetric NHCs. In this regard, N&#8208;acyclic carbenes (NACs) are attractive alternatives due to their high synthetic versatility, allowing easy tuning of their steric and electronic properties towards specific applications. This work reports the first series of stable and monodisperse NAC&#8208;functionalized gold nanoparticles. These particles with sizes ranging 3.8 to 11.6 nm were characterized using NMR, UV&#8208;Vis and TEM. The nanoparticles display good stability at elevated temperatures and for extended periods both dried or dispersed in a medium, as well as in the presence of exogenous thiols. Importantly, these NAC&#8208;stabilized gold nanoparticles offer a promising and versatile alternative to NHC&#8208;stabilized gold nanoparticles.</dc:description>

      <title>Tuning the Thermal Stability and Photoisomerization of Azoheteroarenes through Macrocycle Strain</title>
      <dc:description>Azobenzene and its derivatives are one of the most&#8208;widespread molecular scaffolds in a range of modern applications, as well as in fundamental research. After photoexcitation, azo&#8208;based photoswitches revert back to the most stable isomer in a timescale ( [[EQUATION]] ) that determines the range of potential applications. Attempts to bring [[EQUATION]] to extreme values prompted to the development of azobenzene and azoheteroarene derivatives that either rebalance the E&#8208; and Z&#8208; isomer stabilities, or exploit unconventional thermal isomerization mechanisms. In the former case, one successful strategy has been the creation of macrocycle strain, which tends to impact the E/Z stability asymmetrically, and thus significantly modify [[EQUATION]] . On the bright side, bridged derivatives have shown an improved optical switching owing to the higher quantum yields and absence of degradation. However, in most (if not all) cases, bridged derivatives display a  reversed  thermal stability (more stable Z&#8208;isomer), and smaller [[EQUATION]] than the acyclic counterparts, which restricts their potential interest to applications requiring a fast forward and backwards switch. In this paper, we investigate the impact of alkyl bridges to the thermal stability of phenyl&#8208;azoheteroarenes using computational methods, and we reveal that is indeed possible to combine such improved photo&#8208;switching characteristics while preserving the  regular  thermal stability (more stable E&#8208;isomer), and increased [[EQUATION]] values under the appropriate connectivity and bridge length.</dc:description>

Enzymatically synthesised cellodextrins are known to have limited water solubility beyond DP9, a point at which they self&#8208;assemble into particles resembling the antiparallel cellulose II crystalline packing. We have prepared and characterised a series of site selectively fluorinated cellodextrins of different degrees of fluorination and substitution patterns by chemoenzymatic synthesis. Bearing in mind the potential disruption of the hydrogen bond network of cellulose II, we have prepared and characterised a multiply 6&#8208;fluorinated cellodextrin. In addition, a series of single site selectively fluorinated cellodextrins were synthesised to assess the structural impact upon addition of one fluorine atom per chain. The structural characterisation of these materials at different length scales, combining advanced NMR and microscopy methods, showed that a 6&#8208;fluorinated donor substrate yielded multiply 6&#8208;fluorinated cellodextrin chains that assembled into particles presenting morphological and crystallinity features, and intermolecular interactions, that are unprecedented for cellulose&#8208;like materials.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The discovery of NHCs (NHC = N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes) as ancillary ligands in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalysis ranks as one of the most important developments in synthesis and catalysis.

In this context, although the classical NHCs based on imidazolylidene and imidazolinylidene ring systems are now well&#8208;established, recently tremendous progress has been made in the development and catalytic applications of BIAN&#8211;NHC (BIAN = bis(imino)acenaphtene) class of ligands. The enhanced reactivity of BIAN&#8211;NHCs is a direct result of the combination of electronic and steric properties that collectively allow for a major expansion of the scope of catalytic processes that can be accomplished using NHCs. BIAN&#8211;NHC ligands take advantage of (1) the stronger&#160;&#963;&#963;&#8208;donation, (2) lower lying LUMO orbitals, (3) the presence of an extended &#960;&#960;&#8208;system, (4) the rigid backbone that pushes the N&#8208;wingtip substituents closer to the metal center by buttressing effect, thus resulting in a significantly improved control of the catalytic center and enhanced air&#8208;stability of BIAN&#8211;NHC&#8211;metal complexes at low oxidation state.

      <title>Temperature as an extra dimension in multidimensional protein NMR.</title>
      <dc:description>Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) is a particularly informative method for studying protein structure and dynamics in solution; however, it is also one of the most time&#8208;consuming. Modern approaches to biomolecular NMR are based on lengthy multidimensional (ND) experiments whose duration grows exponentially with the number of dimensions. The experimental time may even be several days in the case of 3D and 4D spectra. Moreover, the experiment often has to be repeated in several different conditions, for example in order to measure the temperature&#8208;dependent effects in a spectrum (temperature coefficients, TCs). In this paper we propose a new approach that involves joint sampling of indirect evolution times and temperature. This allows us to measure TCs with 3D spectra in even less time than is needed to acquire a single spectrum using the conventional approach. We propose two signal processing methods that are complementary in terms of sensitivity and resolution: a) dividing the data into overlapping subsets followed by compressed sensing reconstruction, and b) treating the complete data set with a variant of the Radon transform. The temperature&#8208;swept 3D HNCO spectra of two intrinsically disordered proteins&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;osteopontin and CD44 cytoplasmic tail&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;show that our new approach makes it possible to determine TCs and their non&#8208;linearities effectively. Non&#8208;linearities, which indicate the presence of a compact state, are particularly interesting. We provide the complete package of data acquisition and processing software for this new approach.</dc:description>

      <title>Quinoline Photobasicity &#8211; Investigation within water&#8208;soluble light&#8208;responsive copolymers</title>
      <dc:description>Photobases exhibit a distinctly higher pK  a  in their excited state compared to the ground state, thus, enabling light&#8208;controlled proton transfer reactions. Their versatility in  e.g.  molecular catalysis routes in the dramatic change of the electronic configuration. The absorption of UV light translates in a pK  a  jump of approximately 10 units as established for small molecule photobases. This contribution presents the first synthesis of quinoline&#8208;based polymeric photobases prepared  via  reversible addition&#8210;fragmentation chain&#8208;transfer (RAFT) polymerization. The integration of quinolines as photobase chromophores within copolymers offers new possibilities for light triggered proton transfer in nanostructured materials,  i.e.  , in nanoparticles, at surfaces, membranes and interfaces. To exploit the light&#8208;triggered reactivity of photobases within such materials, we first investigated how the ground and excited state properties of the quinoline unit changes upon polymer integration. To address this matter, we combine absorption and emission spectroscopy with time&#8208;resolved transient absorption studies to reveal photoinduced proton transfer dynamics in various solvents. The results yield important insights into the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of these polymeric quinoline photobases.</dc:description>

      <title>B&#8592;N&#8208;Incorporated Dibenzo&#8208;azaacene with Selective Near&#8208;Infrared Absorption and Visible Transparency</title>
      <dc:description>Organic compounds with selective near&#8208;infrared absorption and visible transparency are very desirable for fabrication of transparent/semi&#8208;transparent opto&#8208;electronic devices. Herein, we develop a molecule with selective near&#8208;infrared absorption property, QBNA&#8208;O, in which four B&#8592;N units are incorporated to the core and two benzodioxin groups are introduced at the termini of the dibenzo&#8208;azaacene skeleton. QBNA&#8208;O exhibits a small optical gap of 1.39 eV due to the strong electron&#8208;donating benzodioxin groups and the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing B&#8592;N units. In toluene solution, QBNA&#8208;O shows a strong absorption peak at 856 nm with the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of only 41 nm as well as very weak absorption in the visible range from 380 nm to 760 nm. Thin films of QBNA&#8208;O exhibit the average visible transparency (AVT) of 78% at the thickness of 205 nm and 90% at the thickness of 45 nm. Solution&#8208;processed organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) of QBNA&#8208;O display ambipolar transporting behavior with the electron mobility of 0.52 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1 and the hole mobility of 0.013 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1 together with excellent air&#8208;stability. The selective NIR absorbing property and excellent charge transporting property imply that QBNA&#8208;O can be used to fabricate transparent organic opto&#8208;electronic devices.</dc:description>

      <title>The Microwave Detection of Wet Triacetone Triperoxide (TATP): Non&#8208;Covalent Forces and Water Dynamics</title>

      <title>DpgC&#8208;catalyzed peroxidation of&#160; DPA&#8208;CoA: insights into the spin&#8208;forbidden transition and charge transfer mechanisms</title>
      <dc:description>Despite being a very strong oxidizing agent, most organic molecules are not oxidized in the presence of O$_2$ at room temperature because O$_2$ is a diradical while most organic molecules are closed&#8208;shell. Oxidation then requires a change in the spin state of the system, forbidden according to non&#8208;relativistic quantum theory. To overcome this limitation, oxygenases usually rely on metal or redox cofactors to catalyze the incorporation of, at least, one oxygen atom into an organic substrate. However, some oxygenases do not require any cofactor, and the detailed mechanism followed by these enzymes remains elusive. To fill this gap, here we study the mechanism for the enzymatic cofactor&#8208;independent oxidation of&#160; 3,5&#8208;dihydroxyphenylacetyl&#8208;CoA (DPA&#8208;CoA) combining multi&#8208;reference calculations on a model system, with QM/MM calculations. Our results reveal that intersystem crossing takes place without requiring the previous protonation of molecular oxygen. The characterization of the electronic states reveals that&#160; &#160;electron transfer is concomitant with the triplet&#8208;singlet transition. The enzyme plays a passive role in promoting the intersystem crossing, although spontaneous reorganization of the water&#8208;wire connecting the active site with the bulk presets the substrate for subsequent chemical transformations. Our results show that the stabilization of the singlet radical&#8208;pair between dioxygen and enolate is enough to promote spin&#8208;forbidden reaction without the need for neither metal cofactors nor basic residues in the active site.</dc:description>

      <title>Understanding the Uniqueness of the 2p&#8208;Elements in the Periodic Table</title>

      <title>An Apparent Umpolung Reactivity of Indole via [Au]&#8208;Catalysed Cyclisation and Lewis&#8208;Acid Mediated Allylation</title>
      <dc:description>The possibility of sequential functionalisation of indole C2 and C3 in an umpolung fashion has been executed with a pre&#8208;designed substrate and choice of reagents. The developed method comprises of a gold&#8208;catalysed alkynol cycloisomerization/ intramolecular addition of C2 of indole and subsequent BF  3  .OEt  2  mediated regioselective C3 allylation, resulting in the synthesis of the functionalized indoloisoquinolinone scaffold. The reaction involves 5&#8208;  endo  &#8208;alkynol cycloisomerization and the dearomative/ addition of indole C2 to the intermediate oxocarbenium cation, which results in two equilibrating fused and spiro pentacyclic intermediates which upon treatment with allylsilane in the presence of BF  3  .OEt  2  , undergo selective indole C3 allylation. Other nucleophiles such as hydride, azide and indole were also found to be compatible in this process.</dc:description>

      <title>Modulation of metallophilic and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions in platinum cyclometalated luminophores with halogen bonding</title>

      <dc:description>Biowaste&#8208;derived substances isolated from green compost (BBS&#8208;GC) are environmental&#8208;friendly reactants similar to humic substances, which bring multiple functionalities, suitable to adsorb different kinds of pollutants in wastewater.

Our results show that both hydrogels and films are mechanically stable and can effectively remove differently charged dyes through an adsorption mechanism describable by the Freundlich model. BBS&#8208;GC&#8208;containing gels always performed better than samples prepared without BBS&#8208;GC, revealing that such unconventional materials can integrate waste valorization and water decontamination, potentially providing social and environmental benefits.</dc:description>

      <title>On the Role of Alkali&#8208;Metal&#8208;Like Superatom Al12P in Reduction and Conversion of Carbon Dioxide</title>
      <dc:description>Developing efficient catalysts for the conversion of CO  2  into fuels and value&#8208;added chemicals is of great significance to relieve the growing energy crisis and global warming. With the assistance of DFT calculations, it is interesting to find that, different from Al  12  X (X = Be, Al, and C), the  alkali&#8208;metal&#8208;like superatom Al  12  P  prefers to combine with CO  2  via a bidentate double oxygen coordination, yielding a stable Al  12  P(  &#951;  2  &#8208;O  2  C) complex containing an activated radical anion of CO  2  (  i.e.  , CO  2  &#8226;&#8722;  ). Thereby, this compound can not only participate in the subsequent cycloaddition reaction with propylene oxide, but also initiate the radical reaction with hydrogen gas to form high value chemicals, revealing that Al  12  P can play an important role in catalyzing these conversion reactions. Considering that Al  12  P has been produced in laboratory, and is capable of absorbing visible light to drive the activation and transformation of CO  2  , we optimistically anticipated that this work could guide the experimentalists to discover such an additional superatom catalyst for CO  2  transformation, and open up a new research field of superatom catalysis.</dc:description>

      <title>Exciton Transport in Molecular Semiconductor Crystals for Spin&#8208;Optoelectronics Paradigm</title>
      <dc:description>Organic semiconductors with ultralong&#8208;range exciton diffusion length is highly desirable for optoelectronics but currently remain rare. Here, we show the diffusion length of singlet excitons (LD) in 2,6&#8208;diphenyl anthracene (DPA) crystals grown by solvent evaporation is up to ~124 nm. These crystals show a previously unseen parallelogram morphology with layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer edge&#8208;on molecular stacking, isotropic optical waveguiding, radiation rate and non&#8208;radiation rate constants of 0.15 ns&#8208;1 and 0.26 ns&#8208;1 respectively, as well as good field effect transistor hole mobility and theoretically computed strong electronic couplings as high as 109 meV. Photoresponse experiments reveal that the photoconductivity of DPA crystals is surprisingly not related to the radiative pathway, but associated with rapid exciton diffusion to crystal surface for charge separation and carrier bimolecular recombination. Taken together, this study shows that DPA with ultralong&#8208;range exciton diffusion length is a promising semiconducting material for new organic optoelectronics paradigm.</dc:description>

      <title>Single&#8208;step glycosylations with 13C&#8208;labelled sulfoxide donors: a low&#8208;temperature NMR cartography of the distinguishing mechanistic intermediates</title>
      <dc:description>Glycosyl sulfoxides have gained recognition in the total synthesis of complex oligosaccharides and as model substrates for dissecting the mechanisms involved. While these donors are usually reacted under pre&#8208;activation conditions, an experimentally more convenient single&#8208;step protocol has also been reported, whereby the activation is performed in the presence of the acceptor alcohol; yet, the nature and prevalence of the reaction intermediates formed in this more complex scenario have comparatively received minimal attention. Herein, we report a systematic NMR&#8208;based study employing both  13  C&#8208;labelled and unlabelled glycosyl sulfoxide donors for the detection and monitorization of marginally populated intermediates. Our results conclusively show that glycosyl triflates play a key role in these glycosylations despite the presence of the acceptor alcohol. Importantly, the formation of covalent donor/acceptor sulfonium adducts has been identified as the main competing reaction, thus defining a non&#8208;productive consumption of the acceptor that could limit the reaction yield.</dc:description>

Importantly, the formation of covalent donor/acceptor sulfonium adducts has been identified as the main competing reaction, thus defining a non&#8208;productive consumption of the acceptor that could limit the reaction yield.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>The convenient cross&#8208;coupling of sp  2  or sp  3  carbons with a specific boron vertex on carborane cage represents significant synthetic values and insurmountable challenges.

      <title>Influence of Amide Connectivity on the Hydrogen Bond Directed Self&#8208;Assembly of [n.n]Paracyclophanes</title>
      <dc:description>Reported here is the synthesis and self&#8208;assembly characterization of [n.n]paracyclophanes (  [n.n]pCps  , &#160;n = 2, 3) equipped with anilide hydrogen bonding units.

      <title>Chiral oligothiophenes with remarkable circularly polarized luminescence and electroluminescence in thin films</title>
      <dc:description>We report circular polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) in thin films of self&#8208;organized oligothiophenes. Four new 1,4&#8208;phenylene and 9H&#8208;carbazole&#8208;based oligothiophenes were ad hoc designed to ensure efficient spontaneous formation of chiral supramolecular order. They were easily synthetized and their chiroptical properties in thin films were measured. Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectra revealed glum in the order of 10&#8208;2 on a wide wavelengths range, originating from their self&#8208;organized chiral supramolecular organization. These molecules have reasonable properties as organic semiconductors and for this reason they can constitute the active layer of circularlypolarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs). Thus, we could investigate directly their electroluminescence (EL) and CPEL, without resorting to blends, but rather in a simple multilayer device with basic architecture. This is the first example of a CP&#8208;OLED with active layer made only of a small organic compound.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries are one of the most promising high&#8208;energy&#8208;density storage system. However, serious capacity attenuation and poor cycling stability induced by the shuttle effect of polysulfide intermediates can impede the practical application of Li&#8208;S batteries.

This structural design enables trapping of active sulfur and serves to localize the soluble polysulfide within the cathode region, leading to low active material loss. Compared with CNTs/S, CNTs/BNFs/S cathodes delivered a high initial capacity of 1222 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 0.1 C. Upon increasing the current density of 4 C, the cell retained a capacity of 482 mAh g  &#8208;1  after 500 cycles with a capacity decay of only 0.044% per cycle.

      <title>What determines the selectivity of arginine dihydroxylation by the nonheme iron enzyme OrfP?</title>
      <dc:description>The nonheme iron enzyme OrfP reacts with L&#8208;Arg selectively to form the 3  R  ,4  R  &#8208;dihydroxyarginine product, which in mammals can inhibit the nitric oxide synthase enzymes involved in blood pressure control. To understand the mechanisms of dioxygen activation of L&#8208;Arg by OrfP and how it enables two sequential oxidation cycles on the same substrate, we performed a density functional theory study on a large active site cluster model. We show that substrate binding and positioning in the active site guides a highly selective reaction through C  3  &#8208;H hydrogen atom abstraction. This happens despite the fact that the C  3  &#8210;H and C  4  &#8210;H bond strengths of L&#8208;Arg are very similar. Electronic differences in the two hydrogen atom abstraction pathways drive the reaction with an initial C  3  &#8210;H activation to a low&#8208;energy  5  s&#8208;pathway, while substrate positioning destabilizes the C  4  &#8210;H abstraction and sends it over the higher&#8208;lying  5  p&#8208;pathway. We show that substrate and monohydroxylated products are strongly bound in the substrate binding pocket and hence product release is difficult and consequently its lifetime will be long enough to trigger a second oxygenation cycle.</dc:description>
