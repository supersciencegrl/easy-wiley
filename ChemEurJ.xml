         <title>Formal Umpolung Addition of Phosphites to 2&#8208;Azaaryl Ketones under Chiral Br&#248;nsted Base Catalysis: Enantioselective Protonation Utilizing [1,2]&#8208;Phospha&#8208;Brook Rearrangement</title>

         <dc:description>The formal enantioselective umpolung addition of dialkyl phosphites to 2&#8208;azaaryl ketones was developed under Br&#248;nsted base catalysis. The reaction involves the enantioselective protonation of the transient &#945;&#8208;oxygenated (2&#8208;azaaryl)methyl anion generated through the 1,2&#8208;addition of the anion of dialkyl phosphite to the 2&#8208;azaaryl ketone and the subsequent [1,2]&#8208;phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement. A chiral bis(guanidino)iminophosphorane organosuperbase efficiently catalyzed the reaction to provide enantio&#8208;enriched phosphates in high yields with good to high enantioselectivities. This is a rare example of the catalytic enantioselective protonation of transient carbanions other than enolates, constructing a trisubstituted stereogenic center &#945; to 2&#8208;azaarenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Perfluoroalkylation of C&#8208;H Bonds in (Hetero)arenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perfluoroalkylated (hetero)arenes represent an extremely important family of molecules commonly utilized in many areas such as medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry and material sciences. Due to their unique properties, they have attracted significant interest from synthetic chemists and various methods have been developed for their synthesis. Among them, the direct perfluoroalkylation of C(sp  2  )&#8208;H bonds in (hetero)arenes is one of the most attractive and straightforward ones, provided that it proceeds with high levels of regioselectivity. In this review article, a comprehensive overview of advances in this field is presented, with a special focus on the reaction mechanisms involved in these transformations and their regioselectivity. All methods available have been classified according to the nature of the perfluoroalkyl chain introduced, trifluoromethylation reactions being overviewed in a separate section, and to the nature of the reagents/catalysts required.</dc:description>

         <title>Sunlight&#8208;Induced In Situ Isomerization of Both Ligands in a Mixed&#8208;Ligand Coordination Polymer: From Photosalient to Photoinert Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Altering the reaction conditions from dark to visible light gives rise to the formation of two different 1D coordination polymers (CPs). Keeping the reaction mixture in dark results in the formation of interdigitated 1D CPs, which undergo photodimerization accompanied by a photosalient effect. On the other hand, while keeping the same reaction mixture under visible light, a different 1D CP is obtained via in&#8197;situ isomerization of both the ligands, which is found to be photoinert.







Abstract
Reaction of Zn(NO3)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6H2O, maleic acid (H2mal) and trans&#8208;4&#8208;(1&#8208;naphthylvinyl)pyridine (trans&#8208;nvp) in the dark results in the formation of a one&#8208;dimensional coordination polymer (1D CP) [Zn(mal)(trans&#8208;nvp)] (1), which is photosalient in nature. The crystals of 1 pop violently under UV light and moderately in sunlight, and generate cyclobutane ligands. However, the same reaction mixture kept in visible light exhibits the rare example of in&#8197;situ isomerization of both ligands: cis&#8208;trans transformation of maleate and trans&#8208;cis isomerization of the nvp ligands, and subsequent formation of another 1D CP [Zn(fum)(cis&#8208;nvp)2(H2O)2] (2, H2fum=fumaric acid), which is found to be photoinert. Thus, altering the reaction condition from dark to visible light gives rise to photosalient to photoinert crystals.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent and Supramolecular Polymers: From Monolayer to Bilayer and the Thicker</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled growth of 2D polymer layers: With the synthetic strategies of monolayer 2D covalent and supramolecular polymers being available, synthetic chemistry for bilayer 2D polymers has emerged, which holds promises for attaining well&#8208;defined, few&#8208;layer 2D polymers. The advances will lead to a bridge to transform 2D materials to 3D materials in a controllable manner.







Abstract
Selective preparation of two&#8208;dimensional polymers (2DPs) and supramolecular polymers (2DSPs) with defined thickness is crucially important for controlling and maximizing their functions, yet it has remained as a synthetic challenge. In the past decade, several approaches have been developed to allow selective preparation of discrete monolayer 2DPs and 2DSPs. Recently, crystal exfoliation and self&#8208;assembly strategies have been employed to successfully prepare bilayer 2DP and 2DSP, which represent the first step towards the controlled &#8220;growth&#8221; of 2D polymers from the thinnest monolayers to thicker few&#8208;layers along the third dimension. This Concept review discusses the concept of accurate synthesis of 2D polymers with defined layers. Advances in this research area will pave the way to rational synthetic strategies for 2D polymers with controlled thickness.

         <title>Chiral Hemilabile P,N&#8208;Ligand&#8208;Assisted Gold Redox Catalysis for Enantioselective Alkene Aminoarylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective, intermolecular alkene arylamination has been achieved through gold redox catalysis. Screening of ligands revealed chiral P,N ligands as the optimal choice, giving alkene aminoarylation with good yields (up to 80&#8201;%) and excellent stereoselectivity (up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 er). As the first example of enantioselective gold redox catalysis, this work confirmed the feasibility of applying a chiral ligand at the gold(I) stage with the stereodetermining step (SDS) at the gold(III) intermediate, thus opening up a new way to conduct gold redox catalysis with stereochemistry control.

         <title>Lipid A Mimetics Based on Unnatural Disaccharide Scaffold as Potent TLR4 Agonists for Prospective Immunotherapeutics and Adjuvants</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TLR4 activating lipid A mimetics with picomolar affinity were assembled on the basis of an unnatural synthetic &#946;,&#946;&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;linked diglucosamine scaffold. Excellent stereoselectivity in a challenging &#946;,&#946;&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;glycosylation was achieved by tuning the reactivities of donor and acceptor molecules using protective group manipulation strategy. Specific 3D&#8208;molecular shape of &#946;GlcN(1&#8596;1&#8242;)&#946;GlcN disaccharide was decisive for induction of pro&#8208;inflammatory signaling by disaccharide lipid A mimetics (&#946;&#946;&#8208;DLAMs) based thereof. Potent immunostimulating potential was confirmed in human and murine immune cells rendering &#946;&#946;&#8208;DLAMs promising vaccine adjuvant candidates.







Abstract
TLR4 is a key pattern recognition receptor that can sense pathogen&#8208; and danger&#8208; associated molecular patterns to activate the downstream signaling pathways which results in the upregulation of transcription factors and expression of interferons and cytokines to mediate protective pro&#8208;inflammatory responses involved in immune defense. Bacterial lipid A is the primary TLR4 ligand with very complex, species&#8208;specific, and barely predictable structure&#8208;activity relationships. Given that therapeutic targeting of TLR4 is an emerging tool for management of a variety of human diseases, the development of novel TLR4 activating biomolecules other than lipid A is of vast importance. We report on design, chemical synthesis and immunobiology of novel glycan&#8208;based lipid A&#8208;mimicking molecules that can activate human and murine TLR4&#8208;mediated signaling with picomolar affinity. Exploiting crystal structure &#8208; based design we have created novel disaccharide lipid A mimetics (DLAMs) where the inherently flexible &#946;(1&#8594;6)&#8208;linked diglucosamine backbone of lipid A is exchanged with a conformationally restrained non&#8208;reducing &#946;GlcN(1&#8596;1&#8242;)&#946;GlcN scaffold. Excellent stereoselectivity in a challenging &#946;,&#946;&#8208;1,1&#8242; glycosylation was achieved by tuning the reactivities of donor and acceptor molecules using protective group manipulation strategy. Divergent streamlined synthesis of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;linked diglucosamine&#8208;derived glycolipids entailing multiple long&#8208;chain (R)&#8208;3&#8208; acyloxyacyl residues and up two three phosphate groups was developed. Specific 3D&#8208;molecular shape and conformational rigidity of unnatural &#946;,&#946;&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;linked diglucosamine combined with carefully optimized phosphorylation and acylation pattern ensured efficient induction of the TLR4&#8208;mediated signaling in a species&#8208;independent manner.

         <title>The Aryl Sulfide Synthesis via Sulfide Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An eco&#8208;friendly sulfide transfer protocol is explored under a reductive Pd&#8208;catalyzed, Ni&#8208;mediated condition. Both experimental and theoretical results support the sulfide transfer over the aryl transfer. Late&#8208;functionalization of drugs and semiconducting materials highlight the importance of the method.







Abstract
Aryl sulfides are in great demands in drugs and materials sciences. To avoid using nucleophilic and noxious thiols, many efforts have been focused on exploring novel sulfide resources. Herein, a reductive Pd&#8208;catalyzed, Ni&#8208;mediated method to synthesize aryl sulfides via a sulfide transfer reaction is developed. The utility and scope of this reaction is exemplified by various aryl electrophiles and aryl sulfides. Mechanistic studies reveal two competing catalytic cycles of sulfide transfer and aryl transfer in this reaction, where the former one is favored over the later one because of the large energy barrier difference during the transmetalation. Moreover, two important chemicals are late&#8208;stage functionalized by this method, exhibiting the potential applications in drugs and materials science.

         <title>Reliable Functionalization of 5,6&#8208;Fused Bicyclic N&#8208;Heterocycles Pyrazolopyrimidines and Imidazopyridazines via Zinc and Magnesium Organometallics</title>

         <dc:description>
N&#8208;heterocycles, pyrazolopyrimidines and imidazopyridazines were reliably functionalized with the support of DFT &#8208; calculations using Grignard reagents as nucleophilic partners and TMPZn&#8208;mediated zincations for 5&#8208;chloropyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidine. Successive regioselective magnesiations with TMPMgCl&#8901;LiCl or TMP2Zn&#8901;MgCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2&#8201;LiCl in the presence or absence of BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2 for the 6&#8208;chloroimidazo[1,2&#8208;b]pyridazine scaffold provided a range of highly functionalized new N&#8208;heterocycles of pharmaceutical interest.







Abstract
DFT&#8208;calculations allow prediction of the reactivity of uncommon N&#8208;heterocyclic scaffolds of pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidines and imidazo[1,2&#8208;b]pyridazines and considerably facilitate their functionalization. The derivatization of these N&#8208;heterocycles was realized using Grignard reagents for nucleophilic additions to 5&#8208;chloropyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidines and TMP2Zn&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2&#8201;MgCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2&#8201;LiCl allowed regioselective zincations. In the case of 6&#8208;chloroimidazo[1,2&#8208;b]pyridazine, bases such as TMP2Zn&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;MgCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2&#8201;LiCl, in the presence or absence of BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2, led to regioselective metalations at positions 3 or 8. Subsequent functionalizations were achieved with TMPMgCl&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;LiCl, producing various polysubstituted derivatives (up to penta&#8208;substitution). X&#8208;ray analysis confirmed the regioselectivity for key functional heterocycles.

Pt NPs on octadecahedral &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 supports with a truncated hexagonal bipyramid shape (Pt/&#945;&#8208;Fe2O3&#8208;O) and rod&#8208;shaped &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 supports (Pt/&#945;&#8208;Fe2O3&#8208;R) were prepared. The electronic structure and dispersion of Pt NPs can be modified by the supports. The Pt/&#945;&#8208;Fe2O3&#8208;O catalyst exhibited superior catalytic performance for hydrogenation of 3&#8208;nitrostyrene because its low coordinated Pt sites and small size of Pt NPs, which is a benefit from the high&#8208;index exposed surfaces of truncated hexagonal bipyramid&#8208;shaped &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 support.







Abstract
Selective hydrogenation of substituted nitroaromatic compounds is an extremely important and challenging reaction. Supported metal catalysts attract much attention in this reaction because the properties of metal nanoparticles (NPs) can be modified by the nature of the support. Herein, the support morphology on the catalytic performance of selective hydrogenation of 3&#8208;nitrostyrene to 3&#8208;vinylaniline was investigated. Pt NPs supported on octadecahedral &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 supports with a truncated hexagonal bipyramid shape (Pt/&#945;&#8208;Fe2O3&#8208;O) and rod&#8208;shaped &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 supports (Pt/&#945;&#8208;Fe2O3&#8208;R) were prepared by glycol reduction method. Detailed characterizations reveal that the electronic structure and dispersion of Pt NPs can be modified by the supports. The Pt/&#945;&#8208;Fe2O3&#8208;O catalyst exhibited superior catalytic performance for hydrogenation of 3&#8208;nitrostyrene because of its low coordinated Pt sites and the small Pt NPs size, which is benefit from the high&#8208;index exposed surfaces of truncated hexagonal bipyramid&#8208;shaped &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 support. The structural evolution during the catalytic reaction was investigated in detail by identical location transmission electron microscopy (IL&#8208;TEM) method, which found that the high cycling activity of Pt/&#945;&#8208;Fe2O3&#8208;O catalyst during the cycle experiment results from the stability of Pt NPs.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selective hydrogenation of substituted nitroaromatic compounds is an extremely important and challenging reaction. Supported metal catalysts attract much attention in this reaction because the properties of metal nanoparticles (NPs) can be modified by the nature of the support. Herein, the support morphology on the catalytic performance of selective hydrogenation of 3-nitrostyrene to 3-vinylaniline was investigated. Pt NPs supported on octadecahedral &#945;-Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; supports with a truncated hexagonal bipyramid shape (Pt/&#945;-Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-O) and rod-shaped &#945;-Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; supports (Pt/&#945;-Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-R) were prepared by glycol reduction method. Detailed characterizations reveal that the electronic structure and dispersion of Pt NPs can be modified by the supports. The Pt/&#945;-Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-O catalyst exhibited superior catalytic performance for hydrogenation of 3-nitrostyrene because of its low coordinated Pt sites and the small Pt NPs size, which is benefit from the high-index exposed surfaces of truncated hexagonal bipyramid-shaped &#945;-Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; support. The structural evolution during the catalytic reaction was investigated in detail by identical location transmission electron microscopy (IL-TEM) method, which found that the high cycling activity of Pt/&#945;-Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-O catalyst during the cycle experiment results from the stability of Pt NPs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Acyl Group Migration in Pyranosides as Studied by Experimental and Computational Methods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive experimental and computational study on acyl migration in different monosaccharides with five different acyl groups, under similar conditions, provides conclusive evidence for the anionic, stepwise migration mechanism, which depends on the concentration of the hydroxyl anion and pKa of the receiving hydroxyl group, together with the anomeric and relative configurations of the carbohydrate in question.







Abstract
Acyl group migration affects the synthesis, isolation, manipulation and purification of all acylated organic compounds containing free hydroxyl groups, in particular carbohydrates. While several isolated studies on the migration phenomenon in different buffers have been reported, comprehensive insights into the overall migration process in different monosaccharides under similar conditions have been lacking. Here, we have studied the acyl migration in different monosaccharides using five different acyl groups by a combination of experimental, kinetic and theoretical tools. The results show that the anomeric configuration in the monosaccharide has a major influence on the migration rate, together with the relative configurations of the other hydroxyl groups and the nature of the migrating acyl group. Full mechanistic model, based on computations, demonstrates that the acyl migration proceeds through an anionic stepwise mechanism with linear dependence on the [OH&#8722;] and the pKa of the hydroxyl group toward which the acyl group is migrating.

         <title>A One&#8208;Pot Approach for Bio&#8208;Based Arylamines via a Combined Photooxidative Dearomatization&#8208;Rearomatization Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;for&#8208;one: Arylamines were obtained from biomass&#8208;derived phenolic substrates and cyclic &#945;&#8208;amino acids by combining photooxidative dearomatization with decarboxylation/azomethine ylide chemistry. A novel organophotocatalytic approach was reported for the synthesis of a wide range of p&#8208;quinols, including natural products and pharmaceutically&#8208;relevant compounds.







Abstract
The synthesis of arylamines from renewable resources under mild reaction conditions is highly desired for the sustainability of the chemical industry, where the production of hazardous waste is a prime concern. However, to date, there are very few tools in chemists&#8217; toolboxes that are able to produce arylamines in a sustainable manner. Herein, a robust one&#8208;pot approach for constructing bio&#8208;based arylamines via a combined photooxidative dearomatization&#8208;rearomatization strategy is presented. The developed methodology enables the synthesis of structurally complex amines in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good isolated yields using biomass&#8208;derived phenols, natural &#945;&#8208;amino acids, and naphthols under remarkably mild reaction conditions. For the photooxygenation of phenols, a novel chrysazine&#8208;based catalyst system was introduced, demonstrating its efficiency for the synthesis of natural products &#8211; hallerone, rengyolone, and the pharmaceutically relevant prodrug DHED.

         <title>Single&#8208;Phase Precursors for the Preparation of Spinel Ferrites via Oxalate Route: the Study of Cobalt Ferrite Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the benefits of single&#8208;phase oxalate precursors for the preparation of spinel ferrites by thermal decomposition. Various characterization techniques are employed to study the bimetallic nature of the oxalate precursor. The thermal decomposition of the bimetallic oxalate is investigated using in situ XRD. The products of decomposition are further examined by M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, XRD and N2 adsorption.







Abstract
This work explores the benefits of single&#8208;phase oxalate precursors for the preparation of spinel ferrites by thermal decomposition. A direct comparison between the genuine oxalate solid solution and the physical mixture of simple oxalates is presented using the case study of cobalt ferrite preparation. The mixing of metal cations within a single oxalate structure could be verified prior to its thermal decomposition by several non&#8208;destructive experimental techniques, namely M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray powder diffraction (XRD) and energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy. In situ XRD experiments were conducted to compare the decomposition processes of the solid solution and the physical mixture. Additionally, the decomposition products of the FeCo oxalate solid solution were studied ex situ by means of N2 adsorption, M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and XRD. The results obtained for different reaction temperatures demonstrate the possibilities to easily control the physical properties of the prepared oxides.

         <title>Reversible and Stepwise Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Transformation of a Platinum(II) Complex with Vapochromic Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Out of the blue: The blue color of the luminescence of a PtII complex bearing an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene changes in response to the vapor atmosphere, although the single crystallinity and luminescence intensity are maintained. The vapor&#8208;induced reversible and stepwise single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformations were elucidated by variable&#8208;temperature and continuous in&#8208;situ tracking of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements.







Abstract
The vapochromic single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformation of a highly luminescent PtII complex bearing an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene [Pt(CN)2(tBu&#8208;impy)] (tBu&#8208;impyH+=1&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazolium) is reported. The trihydrate form of the complex, which exhibits blue 3MMLCT emission owing to weak Pt&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt interactions, changed its luminescence color from blue to yellowish&#8208;green upon the desorption of water molecules while keeping the high emission quantum yield of more than 0.45. Variable&#8208;temperature and continuous in&#8208;situ tracking of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements revealed that the SCSC transformation proceeds reversibly by the release and reabsorption of water molecules, thereby changing the stacked structure slightly. As a result, the dynamics of vapor&#8208;induced SCSC transformation were elucidated: that the anhydrous form returned to the original trihydrate form in a two&#8208;step process under a water vapor atmosphere. In addition, the PtII complex exhibited a similar SCSC response accompanied by a luminescence color change in the presence of methanol vapor, while being inactive toward ethanol vapor.

         <title>Structural Phase Transitions and Magnetic Superexchange in MIAgIIF3 Perovskites at High Pressure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations predict that MIAgIIF3 perovskites undergo a series of pressure&#8208;induced phase transitions towards post&#8208;perovskite phases. These transitions are associated with changes of the first coordination sphere of AgII and an increasing complexity of the [AgF3] sublattice connectivity. Remarkably, the coordination number of the alkali metal ions decreases upon phase transitions. More information can be found in the Research Article by P. K&#246;gerler, W. Grochala, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200712).

         <title>Decoration Strategy in Para Boron Position: An Effective Way to Achieve Ideal Multi&#8208;Resonance Emitters</title>

Tunable narrowband emitters: In the &#8220;decoration strategy in para B position&#8221;, introduction of an electron donor or acceptor could induce a hypsochromic&#8208; or bathochromic&#8208;shift emission without undesirable spectral broadening, proving a reasonable molecular design approach for color&#8208;tunable, quenching&#8208;resistant, narrowband and stable multi&#8208;resonance emitters.







Abstract
Narrowband, full&#8208;color, and quenching&#8208;resistant emitters are urgently needed for the next generation high&#8208;resolution displays. Though the flourishment of narrowband multiple resonance (MR) emitters in blue region, these materials still face thorny challenges such as effective light&#8208;color regulation strategies and concentration&#8208;induced spectral broadening/emission quenching. Herein, the research status of an effective &#8220;decoration strategy for para B position&#8221; is highlighted. On one hand, the introduction of an electron donor or acceptor could induce a hypsochromic&#8208; or bathochromic&#8208;shift emission, respectively, without undesirable FWHM broadening. On the other hand, a more advanced molecular motif is further proposed through adopting a peripheral benzene ring on the para position of the B&#8208;substituted phenyl in MR core to construct the high&#8208;purity, high&#8208;efficiency, quenching&#8208;resistant and stable MR emitters. Such concept is expected to provide a possible way for the modification, optimization and expansion of MR emitters to meet more possible applications.

         <title>The Non&#8208;Ancillary Nature of Trimethylsilylamide Substituents in Boranes and Borinium Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 27, May 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of borinium cations were generated from boranes by fluoride extraction. The authors investigated the reaction mechanism using observational and density functional calculations and discuss how silyl&#8208;amide substituents in boranes and borinium cations are shown not to be ancillary substituents, but rather act as sources of protons, SiMe3 and methyl groups.







Abstract
The known boranes (R(Me3Si)N)2BF (R=Me3Si 1, tBu 2, C6F5 3, o&#8208;tol 4, Mes 5, Dipp 6) and borinium salts (R(Me3Si)N)2B][B(C6F5)4] (R=Me3Si 7, tBu 8) are prepared and fully characterized. Compound 7 is shown to react with phosphines to generate [R3PSiMe3]+ and [R3PH]+ (R=Me, tBu). Efforts to generate related borinium cations via fluoride abstraction from (R(Me3Si)N)2BF (R=C6F5 3, o&#8208;tol 4, Mes 5) gave complex mixtures suggesting multiple reaction pathways. However for R=Dipp 6, the species [(&#956;&#8208;F)(SiMe2N(Dipp))2BMe][B(C6F5)4] was isolated as the major product, indicating methyl abstraction from silicon and F/Me exchange on boron. These observations together with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art DFT mechanistic studies reveal that the trimethylsilyl&#8208;substituents do not behave as ancillary subsitutents but rather act as sources of proton, SiMe3 and methyl groups.

         <title>An Allyl Uranium(IV) Sandwich Complex: Are &#981; Bonding Interactions Possible?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 27, May 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complexes of actinide species that employ the unique orbital structure of the f orbitals is still quite rare. We have used theory&#8208;directed synthesis to create a unique uranium&#8208;allyl species with an orbital configuration designed to optimize the potential for ligand&#8208;f orbital bonding. The resulting U&#8208;allyl sandwich complex displays unexpected 3c&#8211;2e bonding between the uranium center and two ligand&#8208;based carbons with a large degree of covalency.







Abstract
A method to explore head&#8208;to&#8208;head &#981; back&#8208;bonding from uranium f&#8208;orbitals into allyl &#960;* orbitals has been pursued. Anionic allyl groups were coordinated to uranium with tethered anilide ligands, then the products were investigated by using NMR spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal XRD, and theoretical methods. The (allyl)silylanilide ligand, N&#8208;((dimethyl)prop&#8208;2&#8208;enylsilyl)&#8208;2,6&#8208;diisopropylaniline (LH), was used as either the fully protonated, singly deprotonated, or doubly deprotonated form, thereby highlighting the stability and versatility of the silylanilide motif. A free, neutral allyl group was observed in UI2(L1)2 (1), which was synthesized by using the mono&#8208;deprotonated ligand [K][N&#8208;((dimethyl)prop&#8208;2&#8208;enyl)silyl)&#8208;2,6&#8208;diisopropylanilide] (L1). The desired homoleptic sandwich complex U[L2]2 (2) was prepared from all three ligand precursors, but the most consistent results came from using the dipotassium salt of the doubly deprotonated ligand [K]2[N&#8208;((dimethyl)propenidesilyl)&#8208;2,6&#8208;diisopropylanilide] (L2). This allyl&#8208;based sandwich complex was studied by using theoretical techniques with supporting experimental spectroscopy to investigate the potential for phi (&#981;) back&#8208;bonding. The bonding between UIV and the allyl fragments is best described as ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal electron donation from a two carbon fragment&#8208;localized electron density into empty f&#8208;orbitals.

A concise method for the asymmetric synthesis of tricyclic chromans from salicylaldehydes and cyclic ketones was developed through bifunctional enamine&#8208;metal Lewis acid catalysis. Mechanism of the chroman formation reaction was proposed and investigated with deuterium experiments and DFT calculations. Tricyclic chromans containing three consecutive stereogenic centers were prepared in good yields (up to 87&#8201;%) and stereoselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee and 11&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr).







Abstract
Cooperative enamine&#8208;metal Lewis acid catalysis has emerged as a powerful tool to construct carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond forming reactions. A concise synthetic method for asymmetric synthesis of chromans from cyclohexanones and salicylaldehydes has been developed to afford tricyclic chromans containing three consecutive stereogenic centers in good yields (up to 87&#8201;%) and stereoselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee and 11&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). This difficult organic transformation was achieved through bifunctional enamine&#8208;metal Lewis acid catalysis. It is believed that the strong activation of the salicylaldehydes through chelating to the metal Lewis acid and the bifunctional nature of the catalyst accounts for the high yields and enantioselectivity of the reaction. The absolute configurations of the chroman products were established through X&#8208;ray crystallography. DFT calculations were conducted to understand the mechanism and stereoselectivity of this reaction.

         <title>On the Existence and Role of Formaldehyde During Aqueous Electrochemical Reduction of Carbon Monoxide to Methanol by Cobalt Phthalocyanine</title>

A fresh look: Molecular electrochemical reduction of carbon monoxide with Co phthalocyanine leads to methanol, with formaldehyde being formed as an intermediate as well as a secondary product. Demonstration of this rare reactivity and mechanistic insights open a new perspective for the solar fuel community.







Abstract
A long&#8208;time challenge in aqueous CO2 electrochemical reduction is to catalyze the formation of products beyond carbon monoxide with selectivity. Formaldehyde is the simplest of these products and one of the most relevant due to its broad use in the industry. Paradoxically it is one of the less reported product. Such scarcity may be in part explained by difficult identification and quantification using conventional chromatography or proton nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. Likewise, indirect detection methods are usually not compatible with labelled studies for asserting product origin. Recently, the possible production of formaldehyde during electrochemical reduction of carbon monoxide to methanol at cobalt phthalocyanine molecular catalyst in basic media has been the object of contradictory reports. By applying an analytical procedure based on proton NMR along with labelled studies, we provide definitive evidence for HCHO formation. We have further identified the possible scenarios for methanol formation through formaldehyde and revealed that the formation of the intermediate and its subsequent reduction are taking place at the same single active site. These studies open a new perspective to improve selectivity toward formaldehyde formation and to develop a subsequent chemistry based on reacting it with nucleophiles.

         <title>Photoswitching Affinity and Mechanism of Multivalent Lectin Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 27, May 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An arylazopyrazole&#8208;containing divalent ligand was tailored to control multivalent binding to the model lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) by light irradiation. The ligand was designed in such a way that only the E isomer is able to bridge adjacent binding sites of WGA. The two photoisomers show an unprecedentedly high change in binding affinity, as determined by isothermal titration calorimetry and different binding modes (chelating binding for the E isomer and crosslinking binding for the Z isomer).







Abstract
Multivalent receptor&#8211;ligand binding is a key principle in a plethora of biological recognition processes. Immense binding affinities can be achieved with the correct spatial orientation of the ligands. Accordingly, the incorporation of photoswitches, which can be used to reversibly change the spatial orientation of molecules, into multivalent ligands is a means to alter the binding affinity and possibly also the binding mode of such ligands. We report a divalent ligand for the model lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) containing an arylazopyrazole photoswitch. This switch, which has recently been introduced as an alternative to the more commonly used azobenzene moiety, is characterized by almost quantitative E/Z photoswitching in both directions, high quantum yields, and high thermal stability of the Z isomer. The ligand was designed in a way that only one of the isomers is able to bridge adjacent binding sites of WGA leading to a chelating binding mode. Photoswitching induces an unprecedentedly high change in lectin binding affinity as determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Furthermore, additional dynamic light scattering (DLS) data suggest that the binding mode of the ligand changes from chelating binding of the E isomer to crosslinking binding of the Z isomer.

Formation of a tetrameric heteropolyoxometalate ring of bismuth&#8208;containing lacunary phosphomolybdate clusters.







Abstract
A new hetero&#8208;bimetallic polyoxometalate (POM) nano&#8208;ring was synthesized in a one&#8208;pot procedure. The structure consists of tetrameric units containing four bismuth&#8208;substituted monolacunary Keggin anions including distorted [BiO8] cubes. The nano&#8208;ring is formed via self&#8208;assembly from metal precursors in aqueous acidic medium. The compound (NH4)16[(BiPMo11O39)4]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;22&#8201;H2O; (P4Bi4Mo44) was characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS), Raman spectroscopy, matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionisation&#8208;time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI&#8208;TOF), and thermogravimetry/differential scanning calorimetry mass spectrometry (TG&#8208;DSC&#8208;MS). The formation of the nano&#8208;ring in solution was studied by time&#8208;resolved in&#8197;situ small&#8208; and wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS) and in&#8197;situ EXAFS measurements at the Mo&#8722;K and the Bi&#8722;L3 edge indicating a two&#8208;step process consisting of condensation of Mo&#8208;anions and formation of Bi&#8722;Mo&#8208;units followed by a rapid self&#8208;assembly to yield the final tetrameric ring structure.

         <title>Cocrystal Formation Precedes the Mechanochemically Acetate&#8208;Assisted C&#8722;H Activation with [Cp*RhCl2]2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 27, May 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanistic insights into the mechanochemically acetate&#8208;assisted C&#8722;H activation of nitrogen containing substrates with [Cp*RhCl2]2 are reported in this work. Ex&#8208;situ analysis revealed the formation of unexpected crystalline phases prior to the C&#8722;H activation step, making the mechanochemical pathway different from the mechanism in solution. Moreover, the mechanochemical protocol enabled the synthesis of Cp*Rh(2&#8208;benzilpyridine)Cl, a the six&#8208;membered rhodacycle previously reported as impossible to access in solution.







Abstract
This work reports the experimentally studied mechanochemical formation of rhodacycles by ball milling pyridine&#8208; and quinoline&#8208;derived substrates and [Cp*RhCl2]2 in the presence of NaOAc. Ex&#8208;situ analysis of the mechanochemical reactions using powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), solid&#8208;state UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy and ATR&#8208;FTIR spectroscopy revealed the formation of unexpected cocrystals between the substrates and the rhodium dimer prior to the C&#8722;H activation step. This sequence of events differs from the generally accepted steps in solution in which cleavage of [Cp*RhCl2]2 is initiated by acetate ions. Additionally, the mechanochemical approach enabled the synthesis of the six&#8208;membered rhodacycle [Cp*Rh(2&#8208;benzilpyridine)Cl], a metal complex repeatedly reported as inaccessible in solution. Altogether, the results of this investigation clarify some of the fundamental aspects of mechanochemical cyclometallations.

&lt;p&gt;This work reports the experimentally studied mechanochemical formation of rhodacycles by ball milling pyridine- and quinoline-derived substrates and [Cp*RhCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the presence of NaOAc. Ex-situ analysis of the mechanochemical reactions using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), solid-state UV-vis spectroscopy and ATR-FTIR spectroscopy revealed the formation of unexpected cocrystals between the substrates and the rhodium dimer prior to the C&#8722;H activation step. This sequence of events differs from the generally accepted steps in solution in which cleavage of [Cp*RhCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is initiated by acetate ions. Additionally, the mechanochemical approach enabled the synthesis of the six-membered rhodacycle [Cp*Rh(2-benzilpyridine)Cl], a metal complex repeatedly reported as inaccessible in solution. Altogether, the results of this investigation clarify some of the fundamental aspects of mechanochemical cyclometallations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tetranuclear Dicationic Aurophilic Gold(I) Catalysts in Enyne Cycloisomerization: Cooperativity for a Dramatic Shift in Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 27, May 11, 2022. </description>

Towards specific &#8220;cluster&#8208;like&#8221; reactivity? Ligands pre&#8208;organizing gold centers in a constrained environment, assisted by aurophilic interactions, push further the selectivity not achieved by mono&#8208; and digold complexes from previously unseen cooperative tetragold catalysis.







Abstract
In comparison to mononuclear gold Lewis acid catalysts, digold complexes and dual&#8208;gold catalysis have illustrated a distinct and powerful potential for the activation of carbon&#8208;carbon multiple bonds. Herein, this concept is pushed further by designing novel tetranuclear gold(I) dicationic complexes structurally supported by strongly stabilizing constraint diphosphinoferrocenyl ligands and attractive closed&#8208;shell Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au aurophilic interactions. The use of a molecularly&#8208;defined tetranuclear dicationic aurophilic gold(I) precatalyst for the selectivity&#8208;challenging cycloisomerization of low&#8208;substituted 1,6&#8208;enynes favors the formation with high selectivity of strained azabicyclo[4.1.0]hept&#8208;4&#8208;enes &#8211; even in the complete absence of activating/orienting substituents on alkyne and olefin reactive functions. This selectivity is not achieved by the reported phosphine&#8208; and carbene&#8208;stabilized mono&#8208; and dinuclear cationic gold(I) complexes, including the ones formed from the same ligands. More importantly this selectivity differs also from nanoparticles and heterogeneous gold catalysts reported to date. DFT studies correlated to experimental mechanistic investigations support an unprecedented &#8220;cluster&#8208;like&#8221; reactivity from polynuclear cooperation at the origin of this peculiar selectivity where the aurophilic interactions preexist, and pre&#8208;organize, gold cluster reactive intermediates.

         <title>Quantum Chemistry&#8208;based Molecular Dynamics Simulations as a Tool for the Assignment of ESI&#8208;MS/MS Spectra of Drug Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 27, May 11, 2022. </description>

The previously unknown fragmentation pathways of the two drug molecules Nateglinide (45 atoms) and Zopiclone (51 atoms) are completely elucidated using a combination of generic formalisms and calculations conducted with the Quantum Chemical Mass Spectrometry (QCxMS) program. The computations of the de novo fragment spectra were conducted with the semi&#8208;empirical GFNn&#8208;xTB (n=1, 2) methods and compared against Orbitrap measured electrospray ionization (ESI) spectra in positive ion mode.







Abstract
In organic mass spectrometry, fragment ions provide important information on the analyte as a central part of its structure elucidation. With increasing molecular size and possible protonation sites, the potential energy surface (PES) of the analyte can become very complex, which results in a large number of possible fragmentation patterns. Quantum chemical (QC) calculations can help here, enabling the fast calculation of the PES and thus enhancing the mass spectrometry&#8208;based structure elucidation processes. In this work, the previously unknown fragmentation pathways of the two drug molecules Nateglinide (45 atoms) and Zopiclone (51 atoms) were investigated using a combination of generic formalisms and calculations conducted with the Quantum Chemical Mass Spectrometry (QCxMS) program. The computations of the de novo fragment spectra were conducted with the semi&#8208;empirical GFNn&#8208;xTB (n=1, 2) methods and compared against Orbitrap measured electrospray ionization (ESI) spectra in positive ion mode. It was found that the unbiased QC calculations are particularly suitable to predict non&#8208;evident fragment ion structures, sometimes contrasting the accepted generic formulation of fragment ion structures from electron migration rules, where the &#8220;true&#8221; ion fragment structures are approximated. For the first time, all fragment and intermediate structures of these large&#8208;sized molecules could be elucidated completely and routinely using this merger of methods, finding new undocumented mechanisms, that are not considered in common rules published so far. Given the importance of ESI for medicinal chemistry, pharmacokinetics, and metabolomics, this approach can significantly enhance the mass spectrometry&#8208;based structure elucidation processes and contribute to the understanding of previously unknown fragmentation pathways.

         <title>Large Enhancement of the Single&#8208;Molecular Conductance of a Molecular Wire through a Radical Substituent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 27, May 11, 2022. </description>

A radical solution: Single&#8208;molecular conductances were compared between methyl&#8208; and iminonitroxide&#8208;substituted 4&#8208;(biphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;yl)pyridine wires bound on porphyrin template by STM apparent height measurement. Statistical analysis of the STM images revealed that the radical&#8208;substituted wire has 3.2&#177;1.7&#8208;fold larger conductance than the methyl&#8208;substituted reference, despite the fact that only 17&#8201;% of the SOMO is calculated to be distributed on the wire moiety.







Abstract
The single&#8208;molecular conductance between two &#960;&#8208;conjugated wires with and without a radical substituent has been compared. Specifically, methyl&#8208; and iminonitroxide&#8208;substituted 4&#8208;(biphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;yl)pyridine wires bound onto a porphyrin template were subjected to scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) apparent&#8208;height measurement at the interface between highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) and octan&#8208;1&#8208;oic acid. Statistical analysis of the STM images revealed that the radical&#8208;substituted wire has 3.2&#177;1.7&#8208;fold higher conductance than the methyl&#8208;substituted reference. Although density functional theory (DFT) calculation suggests that only 17&#8201;% of the SOMO is distributed on the wire moiety, the effect was significant. This study presents the potential of radical substituents to achieve high conductivity in molecular wires.

The importance of O/N&#8208;glycosides as biologically active compounds cannot be overstated. This study is focused on the functionalization of glycals and ribals at the C2 position with alkyl, vinyl, aryl, heteroaryl and strained ring substituents. The functionalized glycals and ribals were transformed into 2&#8208;C&#8208;deoxyglycosides and 2&#8217;&#8208;C&#8208;deoxynucleosides. The application to the synthesis of an analogue of cladribine and clofarabine is described.







Abstract
The synthesis of 2&#8208;C&#8208;glycals and 2&#8208;C&#8208;ribals was achieved in good yields using a nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling between 2&#8208;iodoglycals and 2&#8208;iodoribal respectively and Grignard reagents. The prepared 2&#8208;C&#8208;glycals and ribals were then transformed into 2&#8208;C&#8208;2&#8208;deoxyglycosides, 2&#8208;C&#8208;diglycosides and 2&#8217;&#8208;C&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxynucleosides. The developed method was applied to the synthesis of a 2&#8208;chloroadenine
2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside &#8211; a structural analogue of cladribine (Mavenclad&#174;, Leustatin&#174;) and clofarabine (Clolar&#174;, Evoltra&#174;), two compounds used in the treatment of relapsing&#8208;remitting multiple sclerosis and hairy cell leukemia.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Dehydroxyazidation of Alcohols Promoted by Trifunctional Hypervalent Azido&#8208;Iodine(III) Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 27, May 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a mild, metal&#8208;free practical method for late&#8208;stage dehydroxyazidation of structurally complex alcohols promoted by trifunctional hypervalent azido&#8208;iodine(III) reagents ABZ. The reactions proceeded via an SN2 pathway and showed excellent chemoselectivity and stereospecificity and gave the corresponding azides in high yields. The reaction mechanism was investigated by means of experiments and DFT calculations.







Abstract
The development of convenient new methods for the synthesis of organic azides is highly desirable. Herein, we report a practical method for dehydroxyazidation of alcohols via an SN2 pathway involving PPh3 and trifunctional benziodazolone&#8208;based hypervalent azido&#8208;iodine(III) reagents, which function as an electrophilic center, an azido source, and a base. This mild, chemoselective method was used for late&#8208;stage azidation of structurally complex alcohols, as well as for a new synthetic route to the antiepileptic drug rufinamide. The reaction mechanism was also investigated both experimentally and computationally.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Site&#8208; and Enantioselective Carbene Insertion into Carbon&#8208;Silicon Bonds of Benzosilacyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 27, May 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ligand&#8208;controlled carbene insertion into C(sp3)&#8722;Si and C(sp2)&#8722;Si bonds of benzosilacyclobutanes has been achieved. With sterically bulky BINOL&#8208;based chiral phosphoramidite ligand L1, carbene insertion into the C(sp3)&#8722;Si bond occurred to afford product A in excellent site&#8208; and enantioselectivity. By employing less sterically hindered chiral spiro&#8208;phosphoramidite ligand L2, carbene C(sp2)&#8722;Si bond insertion occurred to give product B with high site&#8208;selectivity. DFT calculation reveals the reaction mechanism and the factors governing the selectivity.







Abstract
We report herein a highly efficient palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbene insertion into strained Si&#8722;C bonds of benzosilacyclobutanes, which provides an efficient method to access &#945;&#8208;chiral silanes. With a sterically hindered ligand, carbene insertion into the C(sp3)&#8722;Si bond of benzosilacyclobutanes occurred in excellent site&#8208; and enantioselectivity, while C(sp2)&#8722;Si bond insertion occurred selectively with less sterically hindered ligands. Reaction mechanism, in particular the roles of the chiral ligands in controlling the site&#8208;selectivity of the insertion reactions, are elucidated by using hybrid density functional theory.

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions in Molecular Systems: Thermodynamic Evaluation of the Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Strength in Amino&#8208;Ethers and Amino&#8208;Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 27, May 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strength of NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O bond in three series of amino&#8208;alcohols characterized by branching, mono&#8208;alkylation of the amino group, or increased chain length between the functional groups, was evaluated by a combination of quantum chemistry and a method based on experimental vaporization enthalpies. It was observed that moderate tertiary branching at the H&#8208;acceptor or at the H&#8208;donor side has only a marginal effect on the NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bond strength so that it remains in the range of &#8722;4&#8197;kJ&#8901;mol&#8722;1 to &#8722;6&#8197;kJ&#8901;mol&#8722;1.







Abstract
The intramolecular hydrogen bond (intra&#8208;HB) is one of the best&#8208;known examples of non&#8208;covalent interactions in molecules. Among the different types of intramolecular hydrogen bonding, the NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bond in amino&#8208;alcohols and amino&#8208;ethers is one of the weakest. In contrast to the strong OH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N intramolecular hydrogen bond, the strength of the NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O bond can hardly be measured with conventional spectroscopic methods, even for simple amino&#8208;alcohols, since the band belonging to the NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O conformer merges with the free OH band. In this work, we developed a combination of G4 calculations, and a method based on experimental vaporization enthalpies to determine the NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bonding strength. The archetypal compounds for this study are 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;ethanol and 3&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;propanol as well as their respective methoxy analogs. Based on these molecules, different series were studied to investigate various factors influencing NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O intra&#8208;HB strength. In the first series, the influence of alkylation near the hydroxy or methoxy group and the amino group in sterically hindered aminoalcohols was examined. In the second series, the influence of alkylation of the amino&#8208;group was investigated. In the third series, the effect of extending the alkyl chain between functional groups was studied.

         <title>Cover Feature: Photoswitching Affinity and Mechanism of Multivalent Lectin Ligands (Chem. Eur. J. 27/2022)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 27, May 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemical cis&#8211;trans isomerization was used to switch a divalent lectin ligand between its two forms, which show contrasting binding properties to the plant lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), as visualized by the yin&#8208;yang symbol. Whereas the E isomer (obtained under irradiation with green light) is able to bridge adjacent binding sites of WGA leading to a high&#8208;affinity chelating binding mode, the Z isomer (obtained under UV light irradiation) crosslinks two lectin molecules associated with a much lower binding affinity. More information can be found in the Research Article by V. Wittmann and co&#8208;authors (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200267).

         <title>Front Cover: Large Enhancement of the Single&#8208;Molecular Conductance of a Molecular Wire through a Radical Substituent (Chem. Eur. J. 27/2022)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 27, May 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular conductance of radical&#8208;substituted molecular wire was evaluated by STM apparent&#8208;height measurement compared with a non&#8208;radical&#8208;substituted wire. Statistical analysis of the STM images revealed that the radical&#8208;substituted wire has a 3.2&#8208;fold larger conductance. Although only 17&#8201;% of the SOMO is calculated to exist on the wire moiety, the effect was significant. This study presents the potential of radical substituents to achieve high conductivity in molecular wires. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Matsuda and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104242).

Abstract
Catalyst wettability regulation has emerged as an attractive approach for high catalytic performance for the past few years. By introducing appropriate wettability, the molecule diffusion of reactants and products can be enhanced, leading to high activity. Besides this, undesired molecules are isolated for high selectivity of target products and long&#8208;term stability of catalyst. Herein, we summarize wettability&#8208;induced high&#8208;performance heterogeneous thermocatalysis in recent years, including hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity, hybrid hydrophilicity&#8208;hydrophobicity, amphiphilicity, and superaerophilicity. Relevant reactions are further classified and described according to the reason for the performance improvement. It should be pointed out that studies of utilizing superaerophilicity to improve heterogeneous thermocatalytic performance have been included for the first time, so this is a comparatively comprehensive review in this field as yet.

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Study of the Ni(II)&#8208; and Pd(II)&#8208;Promoted Double Geminal C(sp3)&#8211;H Bond Activation Providing Facile Access to NHC Pincer Complexes: Isolated Intermediates and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the first examples of metal&#8208;promoted double geminal activation of C(sp  3  )&#8211;H bonds of the N&#8211;CH  2  &#8211;N moiety in an imidazole&#8208;type heterocycle, leading to nickel and palladium NHC complexes under mild conditions. Reaction of the new electron&#8208;rich diphosphine 1,3&#8208;bis((di&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butylphosphaneyl)methyl)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1  H  &#8208;benzo[  d  ]imidazole (  1  ) with [PdCl  2  (cod)] occurred stepwise, first by single C&#8211;H bond activation yielding the alkyl pincer complex [PdCl(PC  sp3  H  P)] (  3  ) with two trans phosphane donors and a covalent Pd&#8211;C  sp3  bond. Activation of the C&#8211;H bond of the resulting &#945;&#8208;methine C  sp3  H&#8211;M group occurred subsequently when  3  was reacted with HCl to yield the NHC pincer complex [PdCl(PC  NHC  P)]Cl (  2  ). The reaction of  1  with [NiBr  2  (dme)] also afforded a NHC pincer complex, [NiBr(PC  NHC  P)]Br (  6  ), but the reactions leading to the double geminal C&#8211;H bond activation of the N&#8211;CH  2  &#8211;N group were too fast to allow identification or isolation of an intermediate analogous to  3  . The determination of six crystal structures, the isolation of reaction intermediates and DFT calculations provided the basis for suggesting the mechanism of the stepwise transformation of a N&#8211;CH  2  &#8211;N moiety in the N&#8211;C  NHC  &#8211;N unit of NHC pincer complexes and explain the key differences observed between the Pd and Ni chemistries.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We report the first examples of metal-promoted double geminal activation of C(sp  3  )&#8211;H bonds of the N&#8211;CH  2  &#8211;N moiety in an imidazole-type heterocycle, leading to nickel and palladium NHC complexes under mild conditions. Reaction of the new electron-rich diphosphine 1,3-bis((di-  tert  -butylphosphaneyl)methyl)-2,3-dihydro-1  H  -benzo[  d  ]imidazole (  1  ) with [PdCl  2  (cod)] occurred stepwise, first by single C&#8211;H bond activation yielding the alkyl pincer complex [PdCl(PC  sp3  H  P)] (  3  ) with two trans phosphane donors and a covalent Pd&#8211;C  sp3  bond.

         <title>Four&#8208;step spin crossover in a new cyano&#8208;bridged iron&#8208;silver coordination polymer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spin&#8208;crossover complexes with multistep transitions attract much attention due to their potential applications as multi&#8208;switches and for data storage. A four&#8208;step spin crossover is observed in the new iron(II)&#8208;based cyanometallic guest&#8208;free framework compound Fe(2&#8208;ethoxypyrazine)  2  {Ag(CN)  2  }  2  during the transition from the low&#8208;spin to the high&#8208;spin state. A reverse process occurs in three steps. Crystallographic studies reveal an associated stepwise evolution of the crystal structures. Multiple transitions in the reported complex originate from distinct Fe  II  sites which exist due to the packing of the ligand with a bulky substituent.</dc:description>

         <title>[2.2]&#8208; and [3.3]Paracyclophane as bridging units in organic dyads for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven dye&#8208;sensitized hydrogen production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel donor&#8211;acceptor dyads containing [2.2]&#8208; and [3.3]paracyclophane (PCP) as the bridging moiety were synthesized and used to effectively fabricate dye&#8208;sensitized hydrogen production systems. All the prepared compounds had a phenothiazine and a cyanoacrylic acid/pyridinyl acrylonitrile moiety acting as an electron donor and acceptor, respectively. Although cyclic voltammetry measurements showed similar electron&#8208;donating properties among all the synthesized dyads, the lowest absorption energy of the [2.2]PCP moiety was lower than that of the [3.3]PCP one; this was due to its shorter distance between benzene rings, which could effectively drive the charge transfer between the donor and acceptor chromophores. Under visible light (&gt;395 nm), a dyad&#8208;loaded photocatalyst in a 0.5 M aqueous glycerol solution generated detectable hydrogen gases. The optimal turnover number and photocurrent order exhibited the same trend as the hydrogen production rate since the suggested number of excited photons played a critical role in hydrogen production.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;(tricyanoborane)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenate anion (  2  )&#160;was obtained in high yield by deprotonation of the B(CN)  3  &#8208;methylimidazole adduct&#160;  1  . Regarding charge and stereo&#8208;electronic properties, anion&#160;  2  &#160;closes the gap between well&#8208;known neutral NHCs and the ditopic dianionic NHC, the&#160;1,3&#8209;bis(tricyanoborane)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenate dianion (  IIb  ). The influence of the number of&#160;  N  &#8208;bonded tricyanoborane moieties on the &#963;&#8208;donating and &#960;&#8208;accepting properties of NHCs was assessed by quantum chemical calculations and verified by experimental data on&#160;  2  ,&#160;  IIb  , and 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#173;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;yilidene (IMe,&#160;  IIa  ). Therefore NHC&#160;  2  , which acts as a ditopic ligand via the carbene center and the cyano groups, was reacted with alkyl iodides, selenium, and [Ni(CO)  4  ] yielding alkylated imidazoles&#160;  3  &#160;and&#160;  4  , the anionic selenium adduct&#160;  5  , and the anionic nickel tricarbonyl complex&#160;  6  , respectively. The results of this study prove that charge, number of coordination sites, buried volume (%  V  bur  ) and &#963;&#8208;donor and &#960;&#8208;acceptor abilities of NHCs can be tuned effectively via the number of tricyanoborane substituents.</dc:description>

         <title>A shared prebiotic formation of neopterins and guanine nucleosides from pyrimidine bases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The prebiotic origins of biopolymers and metabolic co&#8208;factors are key questions in Origins of Life studies. In a simple warm little pond model, utilizing a drying phase to produce a urea&#8208;enriched solution, we present a prebiotic synthetic path for the simultaneous formation of neopterins and tetrahydroneopterins, along with purine nucleosides. We show that the formation of neopterins from pyrimidine precursors, in the presence of ribose, and in a formylating environment consisting of a urea, ammonium formate, water (UAFW) is robust, while the simultaneous formation of guanosine requires a significantly higher ribose concentration. Furthermore, these reactions provide a redox pair of tetrahydropterin&#8208;pterin. This model suggests a prebiotic link in the origin of purine nucleosides and pterin cofactors, which provides a possible deep prebiotic temporal connection for the emergence of nucleic acids and metabolic cofactors</dc:description>

         <title>Dihydroxy&#8208;acid dehydratases from pathogenic bacteria: emerging drug targets to combat antibiotic resistance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is an urgent global need for the development of novel therapeutics to combat the rise of various antibiotic&#8208;resistant superbugs. Enzymes of the branched&#8208;chain amino acid (BCAA) biosynthesis pathway are an attractive target for novel anti&#8208;microbial drug development. Dihydroxy&#8208;acid dehydratase (DHAD) is the third enzyme in the BCAA biosynthesis pathway. It relies on an Fe&#8208;S cluster for catalytic activity and has recently also gained attention as a catalyst in cell&#8208;free enzyme cascades. Two types of Fe&#8208;S clusters have been identified in DHADs,  i.e.  [2Fe&#8208;2S] and [4Fe&#8208;4S], with the latter being more prone to degradation in the presence of oxygen. Here, we characterise two DHADs from bacterial human pathogens,  Staphylococcus aureus  and  Campylobacter jejuni  (  Sa  DHAD and  Cj  DHAD). Purified  Sa  DHAD and  Cj  DHAD are virtually inactive, but activity could be reversibly reconstituted  in vitro  (up to ~19,000&#8208;fold increase with  k  cat  as high as ~6.7 s  &#8208;1  ). Inductively&#8208;coupled plasma&#8208;optical emission spectroscopy (ICP&#8208;OES) measurements are consistent with the presence of [4Fe&#8208;4S] clusters in both enzymes. N&#8208;isopropyloxalyl hydroxamate (IpOHA) and aspterric acid are both potent inhibitors for both  Sa  DHAD (  K  i  = 7.8 and 51.6 &#181;M, respectively) and  Cj  DHAD (  K  i  = 32.9 and 35.1 &#181;M, respectively). These compounds thus present suitable starting points for the development of novel anti&#8208;microbial chemotherapeutics.</dc:description>

N-isopropyloxalyl hydroxamate (IpOHA) and aspterric acid are both potent inhibitors for both  Sa  DHAD (  K  i  = 7.8 and 51.6 &#181;M, respectively) and  Cj  DHAD (  K  i  = 32.9 and 35.1 &#181;M, respectively). These compounds thus present suitable starting points for the development of novel anti-microbial chemotherapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tuning Deazaflavins Towards Highly Potent Reducing Photocatalysts Guided by Mechanistic Understanding &#8208; Enhancement of the Key Step by the Internal Heavy Atom Effect</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deazaflavins are well suited for reductive chemistry acting  via  a consecutive photo&#8208;induced electron transfer, in which their triplet state and semiquinone &#8208; the latter is formed from the former after electron transfer from a sacrificial electron donor &#8208; are key intermediates. Guided by mechanistic investigations aiming to increase intersystem crossing by the internal heavy atom effect and optimising the concentration conditions to avoid unproductive excited singlet reactions, we synthesised 5&#8208;aryldeazaflavins with Br or Cl substituents on different structural positions  via  a three&#8208;component reaction. Bromination of the deazaisoalloxazine core leads to almost 100% triplet yield but causes photo&#8208;instability and enhances unproductive side reactions. Bromine on the 5&#8208;phenyl group in ortho position does not affect the photostability, increases the triplet yield, and allows its efficient usage in the photocatalytic dehalogenation of bromo&#8208; and chloroarenes with electron&#8208;donating methoxy and alkyl groups even under aerobic conditions. Reductive powers comparable to lithium are achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfur and azobenzenes, a profitable liaison: straightforward synthesis of photoswitchable thioglycosides with tunable properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Azobenzene photoswitches are valuable tools for controlling properties of molecular systems with light. We have been investigating azobenzene glycoconjugates to probe carbohydrate&#8208;protein interactions and to design glycoazobenzene macrocycles with chiroptical and physicochemical properties modulated by light irradiation. To date, direct conjugation of glycosides to azobenzenes was performed by reactions providing target compounds in limited yields. We therefore sought a more effective and reliable coupling method. In this paper, we report on a straightforward thioarylation of azobenzene derivatives with glycosyl thiols as well as other thiols, thereby increasing the scope of azobenzene conjugation. Even challenging unsymmetrical conjugates can be achieved in good yields via sequential or one pot procedures. Importantly, red&#8208;shifted azoswitches, which are addressed with visible light were easily functionalized. Additionally, by oxidation of the sulfide bridge to the respective sulfones, both the photochromic and the thermal relaxation properties of the core azobenzene can be tuned. Utilizing this option, we realized orthogonal three&#8208;state photoswitching in mixtures containing two distinct azobenzene thioglycosides.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal borides (TMBs) containing B  n  &#8208;fragment (  n  &gt; 3) have recently gained interest for their ability to enable exciting magnetic materials. Herein, we show that the B  4  &#8208;containing TiFe  0.64(1)  Os  2.36(1)  B  2  is a new ferromagnetic TMB with a Curie temperature of 523(2) K and a Weiss constant of 554(3) K, originating from the chain of  M  3  &#8208;triangles (  M  = 64%Fe + 36%Os). The new phase was synthesized from the elements by arc&#8208;melting, and its structure was elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. It belongs to the Ti  1+  x  Os  2&#8722;  x  RuB  2  &#8208;type structure (space group  P  6&#773;2  m  , no. 189) and contains trigonal planar B  4  boron fragments [B&#9472;B distance of 1.87(4) &#197;] interacting with  M  3  &#8208;triangles [  M  &#9472;  M  distances of 2.637(8) &#197; and 3.0199(2) &#197;]. The experimental results were supported by computational calculations based on the ideal TiFeOs  2  B  2  composition, which revealed strong ferromagnetic interactions within and between the Fe  3  &#8208;triangles. This discovery represents the first magnetically ordered Os&#8208;rich TMB, thus it will help expand our knowledge of the role of Os in low&#8208;dimensional magnetism of intermetallics and enable the design of such materials in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>ThioCORMates: Tunable and Cost&#8208;Effective Carbon Monoxide&#8208;Releasing Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon monoxide&#8208;releasing molecules (CORMs), can offer a safer alternative to CO delivery than the use of CO gas cylinders. Upon treatment with an amine base,  S&#8208;aryl thioformates (&#8220;thioCORMates&#8221;) release CO nearly quantitatively at room temperature, a gas which can then be harnessed for carbonylative cross&#8208;coupling, biological study, or inorganic synthesis. These bench&#8208;stable molecules are easily synthesized from the corresponding thiophenol and can be electronically tuned to release CO at different rates&#8212;from less than 1 minute to greater than 1 hour&#8212;offering a practical alternative to existing CORM technology. Finally, isotopically labeled  13CO can be conveniently generated and used, with the thioCORMate synthesized from  13C&#8208;formic acid.</dc:description>

         <title>Fully Bridged Triphenylamines Comprising Five&#8208; and Seven&#8208;Membered Rings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The heptagon makes the difference: A new family of versatile electron donors based on fully bridged triphenylamines with embedded 5&#8208; and 7&#8208;membered rings has been realized. The structural and optoelectronic properties of the compounds were evaluated both in experiment and theory. The compounds form donor/acceptor systems with strong cyano&#8208;based acceptors and are prone to further functionalization towards &#960;&#8208;extended polycyclic scaffolds.







Abstract
A family of fully bridged triphenylamines with embedded 5&#8208; and 7&#8208;membered rings is presented. The compounds are potent electron donors capable to undergo donor/acceptor interactions with strong cyano&#8208;based acceptors both in the solid state and solution.

     alt="Fully Bridged Triphenylamines Comprising Five- and Seven-Membered Rings"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The heptagon makes the difference&lt;/b&gt;: A new family of versatile electron donors based on fully bridged triphenylamines with embedded 5- and 7-membered rings has been realized. The structural and optoelectronic properties of the compounds were evaluated both in experiment and theory. The compounds form donor/acceptor systems with strong cyano-based acceptors and are prone to further functionalization towards &#960;-extended polycyclic scaffolds.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A family of fully bridged triphenylamines with embedded 5- and 7-membered rings is presented. The compounds are potent electron donors capable to undergo donor/acceptor interactions with strong cyano-based acceptors both in the solid state and solution. These interactions were evaluated by IR and UV/vis spectroscopy as well as X-ray crystallography. The vinylene-bridged compound was oxidized to the corresponding 1,2-diketone which readily underwent acid-catalyzed condensation with selected 1,2-phenylenediamines. The resulting &#960;-extended quinoxaline derivatives represent valuable building blocks for the development of functional chromophores upon appropriate functionalization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cucurbit[7]uril Inhibits IAPP Aggregation by Targeting N&#8208;terminus Hot Segments and Attenuates Cytotoxicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two &#8220;hot segments&#8221; within islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) are responsible for its self&#8208;assembly, which in turn is linked to the decline of &#946;&#8208;cells in type II diabetes (T2D). A readily available water&#8208;soluble, macrocyclic host, cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]), effectively inhibits IAPP aggregation by ion&#8208;dipole and hydrophobic interactions with different residues of the monomeric peptide in its random coil conformation. HSQC NMR study shows that CB[7] modulates IAPP self&#8208;assembly likely by interacting with and masking major residues present in the &#8220;hot segments&#8221; at the N&#8208;terminus. CB[7] also prevents formation of toxic oligomers and inhibits seed&#8208;catalyzed fibril proliferation. Importantly, CB[7] recovers rat insulinoma cells (RIN&#8208;m) from IAPP&#8208;assembly associated cytotoxicity.</dc:description>

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Installation of Dehydroamino Acid Motifs into Peptides Enabled by an N&#8208;Chloropeptide Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conventional methods for the construction of dehydroamino acids (&#916;AAs), which are a unique class of non&#8208;proteiogenic amino acids, require the pre&#8208;installation of special amino acids.

The electrophilic N &#8208;chlorination of peptide bonds is drastically accelerated by a catalytic amount of quinuclidine (ABCO), and the subsequent &#946;&#8208;elimination of N &#8208;chloroamide efficiently provides &#916;AA&#8208;containing peptides in high yield. The strategy enables, for the first time, the construction of a wide variety of &#916;AA residues in peptides without any pre&#8208;functionalized side chains and facilitates the late&#8208;stage installation of &#916;AA motifs into already&#8208;constructed oligopeptides, including a medicinally important macrocyclic peptide.</dc:description>

         <title>Cesium Fluoride Promoted Synthesis of Stable Organocesium Reagents and Their Ambident Reactivities with Arynes.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Described are the diverse reactivities of novel, stable, ambident thio&#8208;organocesium reagents (bearing electron withdrawing groups) against benzynes. Reactions at reflux temperature predominantly led to the generation of various functionalized stable sulfonium ylides and at 45 &#176;C the same reaction underwent direct c&#8208;arylation. Furthermore, Lack of internal hydrogen on cesium reagent helped to produce different ortho&#8208;bifunctional arynes in both the reactions. Interestingly, depending on the reactivities of substrates, the one&#8208;pot tri&#8208;component procedure generated either ylides or &#963;&#8208;bond insertion product.</dc:description>

         <title>Effects of cis/trans&#8208;Configuration and Ligand Substitution of the Cyanidometal Bridge on Metal to Metal Charge Transfer Properties in Mixed Valence Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two series of trinuclear cyanidometal&#8208;bridged compounds with cis/trans configuration were synthesized and fully characterized in this work. The experimental results show that the trans&#8208;configuration and the ligand with high electron&#8208;donating ability of the central cyanidometal bridge are more favorable for MMCT in trinuclear cyanidometal&#8208;bridged mixed valence compounds, and these mixed valence compounds all belong to localized compounds, supported by the TDDFT calculations.







Abstract
To investigate the effects of cis/trans&#8208;configuration of the cyanidometal bridge and the electron donating ability of the auxiliary ligand on the cyanidometal bridge on metal to metal charge transfer (MMCT) in cyanidometal&#8208;bridged mixed valence compounds, two groups of trinuclear cyanidometal&#8208;bridged compounds cis/trans&#8208;[Cp(dppe)Fe(&#956;&#8208;NC)Ru(4,4&#8217;&#8208;dmbpy)2(&#956;&#8208;CN)Fe(dppe)Cp][PF6]n (n=2 (cis/trans&#8208;1[PF6]2), 3 (cis/trans&#8208;1[PF6]3), 4 (cis/trans&#8208;1[PF6]4)) and cis/trans&#8208;[Cp(dppe)Fe(&#956;&#8208;NC)Ru(bpy)2(&#956;&#8208;CN)Fe(dppe)Cp][PF6]3 (cis/trans&#8208;2[PF6]3) were synthesized and fully characterized. The experimental results indicate that for these one&#8208; and two&#8208;electron oxidation mixed valence compounds, the trans&#8208;configuration compounds are more beneficial for MMCT than the cis&#8208;configuration compounds, and increasing the electron donating ability of the auxiliary ligand on the cyanidometal bridge is also conductive to MMCT. Moreover, compounds cis/trans&#8208;1[PF6]n (n=3, 4) and cis/trans&#8208;2[PF6]3 belong to localized compounds by analyzing the experimental characterization results, supported by the TDDFT calculations.

         <dc:description>The utility of 2&#8208;diphenylphosphoryloxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes for the construction of substituted six&#8208;membered nitrogen heterocycles is presented. These dienes undergo boron trifluoride&#8208;promoted aza&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reactions when reacted with imines or related species formed in situ using aldehydes and amine derivatives. The stability of the dienes allows this three&#8208;component reaction to be carried out with no special precautions to eliminate water or air. Thirty&#8208;one examples of this process are presented. The usefulness of the enol phosphate functional group is highlighted in further reactions after the cycloaddition step to generate functionalized piperidenes or pyridines.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Bridging Enables Isolated Iron Atoms on Stereoassembled Carbon Framework To Boost Oxygen Reduction for Zinc&#8208;air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Realizing the synergy between active site regulation and rational structural engineering is essential in the electrocatalysis community but still challenging. Here, we demonstrate a matrix&#8208;confined co&#8208;pyrolysis strategy based on molecular bridging to realize highly dispersed Fe atoms on stereoassembled carbon framework. Both polyacrylonitrile matrix and organic linker from metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) provide sufficient N&#8208;anchoring sites for the generation of Fe&#8208;N  4  moieties. A high Fe loading of 2.9 wt.% is readily achieved based on the scalable approach without post&#8208;treatment. Owing to the presence of highly exposed Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C sites and well&#8208;tuned pore structures, isolated Fe atoms on porous carbon nanofiber framework (Fe&#8208;SA/NCF) exhibits decent oxygen reduction activity and stability in alkaline conditions via a near four&#8208;electron path, demonstrating superior performance as air cathode for zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) to commercial Pt/C catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogenative catalysis with three&#8208;coordinate zinc complexes supported with PN ligands is enhanced compared to PNP analogs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work details the synthesis, characterization, and catalytic activity of reactive low&#8208;coordinate organozinc complexes. The complexes activate hydrogen and they appear to be more active in hydrogenation of ketones and imines than their tridentate pincer analogs. This is thought, in part, to be due to the lack of trailing third phosphorus arm present in previous work. DFT computations reveal a sigma&#8208;bond metathesis mechanism is comparable to an alternative aromatization/dearomatization metal&#8208;ligand cooperative mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>The Pursuit of Perphenylterphenyls</title>

         <dc:description>Tetradecaphenyl&#8208;  p  &#8208;terphenyl (  2  ) was synthesized from 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diiodobenzene (  11  ) by two methods. Ullmann coupling of  11  with pentaphenyliodobenzene (  9  ) gave compound  2  in 1.7% yield, and Sonogashira coupling of  11  with phenylacetylene, followed by a double Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of the product diyne  12  with tetracyclone (  6  ), gave  2  in 1.5% overall yield. The latter reaction also gave the monoaddition product 4&#8208;(phenylethynyl)&#8208;2,2',3,3',4',5,5',6,6'&#8208;nonaphenylbiphenyl (  13  ) in 4% overall yield. The X&#8208;ray structures of compounds  2  and  13  show them to possess core aromatic rings distorted into shallow boat conformations. Density functional calculations indicate that these unusual structures are not the lowest energy conformations in the gas phase, and may be the result of packing forces in the crystal. In addition, while uncorrected DFT calculations indicate that the strain energy in compound  2  is approximately 50 kcal/mol, dispersion&#8208;corrected DFT calculations suggest that it is essentially unstrained, due to compensating, favorable, intramolecular interactions of its many phenyl rings. An attempted synthesis of tetradecaphenyl&#8208;  o  &#8208;terphenyl (  4  ) by reaction of diphenylhexatriyne (  14  ) with three equivalents of tetracyclone at 350 &#176;C gave only the diadduct 2&#8208;(phenylethynyl)&#8208;2',3,3',4,4',5,5',6,6'&#8208;nonaphenylbiphenyl (  15  ) in 17% yield. Even higher temperatures failed to produce  4  and lowered the yield of  15  , perhaps due to rapid decomposition of the starting materials. Ullmann coupling of 3,4,5,6&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;diiodobenzene (  16  ) and compound  9  also failed to give compound  4  .</dc:description>

         <title>Preparation of a Large Amount of Ultrathin Graphdiyne</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and feasible synthesis method is developed to achieve the preparation of GDY with high&#8208;quality and large&#8208;scale. By simply mixing the solution of GDY monomer in CHCl3 and catalysts in water and stirring at room temperature, high&#8208;quality GDY films with a thickness of &#8764;4&#8197;nm can be obtained at the interface of the two&#8208;phase.







Abstract
We report a facile strategy to prepare a large amount of ultrathin graphdiyne (GDY) with good crystallinity in the mixture of oil&#8211;water systems. By simply mixing the solution of GDY monomer in CHCl3 and the copper acetate solution as a catalyst in water and stirring at room temperature, ultrathin GDY films with a thickness of &#8764;4&#8197;nm were obtained in a yield of 95&#8201;%. This work provides a feasible path for the substantial preparation of GDY films and may pave the way to the development of substantial preparation of the GDY materials.

         <title>Adaptable optical microwaveguides from mechanically flexible crystalline materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flexible organic crystals (elastic and plastic) are important materials for optical waveguides, tunable optoelectronic devices, and photonic integrated circuits. Here, we present highly elastic organic crystals of a Schiff base, 1&#8208;((E)&#8208;(2,5&#8208;dichlorophenylimino)methyl)naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ol (  1  ) and an azine molecule, 2,4&#8208;dibromo&#8208;6&#8208;((E)&#8208;((E)&#8208;(2,6&#8208;dichlorobenzylidene)hydrazono)methyl)phenol (  2  ). These microcrystals are highly flexible under external mechanical force, both in the macroscopic and the microscopic regimes. The mechanical flexibility of these crystals arises as a result of weak and dispersive C&#8211;H&#183;&#183;&#183;Cl, Cl&#183;&#183;&#183;Cl, Br&#183;&#183;&#183;Br, and &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; stacking interactions. Singly and doubly&#8208;bent geometries were achieved from their straight shape by a micromechanical approach using the AFM cantilever tip. Crystals of molecules  1  and  2  display a bright&#8208;green and red fluorescence (FL) emission, respectively, and selective reabsorption of a part of their FL band. Crystals  1  and  2  exhibit optical&#8208;path&#8208;dependent low loss emissions at the termini of crystal in their straight and even in extremely bent geometries. Interestingly, the excitation position&#8208;dependent optical modes appear in both linear and bent waveguides of crystals  1  and  2  , confirming their light&#8208;trapping ability.</dc:description>

         <title>Mapping Catalyst&#8208;Solvent Interplay in Competing Carboamination/Cyclopropanation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Group 9 metals, in particular Rh  III  complexes with cyclopentadienyl ligands, are competent C&#8211;H activation catalysts. Recently, a Cp*Rh  III  catalyzed reaction of alkenes with  N  &#8208;enoxyphthalimides showed divergent outcome based on the solvent, with carboamination favored in methanol and cyclopropanation in 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethanol (TFE). Here, we create selectivity and activity maps capable of unravelling the catalyst&#8208;solvent interplay on the outcome of these competing reactions by analyzing 42 cyclopentadienyl metal catalysts, Cp  X  M  III  (M = Co, Rh, Ir). These maps not only can be used to rationalize previously reported experimental results, but also capably predict the behavior of untested catalyst/solvent combinations as well as aid in identifying experimental protocols that simultaneously optimize both catalytic activity and selectivity (solutions in the Pareto front). In this regard, we demonstrate how and why the experimentally employed Cp*Rh  III  catalyst represents an ideal choice to invoke a solvent&#8208;induced change in reactivity. Additionally, the maps reveal the degree to which even perceived minor changes in the solvent (  e.g.  , replacing methanol with ethanol) influence the ratio of carboamination and cyclopropanation products. Overall, the selectivity and activity maps presented here provide a generalizable tool to create global pictures of anticipated reaction outcome that can be used to develop new experimental protocols spanning metal, ligand, and solvent space.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Luminescent organic&#8208;inorganic metal halides (OIMHs) are well known as a new materials family in recent years. Novel materials and applications of luminescent OIMHs have been explored by changing either the organic component or the metal halide species. Thereinto, the stimuli&#8208;responsive (SR) phenomena in OIMHs have drawn much attention recently, for not only their attractive application potential but also the helpfulness in understanding the stability of OIMHs to the external environment. Herein, the luminescent OIMHs that are sensitive to external stimuli including contact, pressure, mechanical grinding, light, heat, and gas molecules, are reviewed, with an emphasis on analyses of the structural change during the SR process. The applications of SR luminescent OIMHs in widespread fields, including gas sensing, information encryption, and rewritable luminescent paper are summarized. Finally, the challenges that deserve to be further explored in this research field are discussed, which provides certain guidance for the future study of SR luminescent OIMHs.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peroxynitrite (ONOO&#8208;) as a major reactive oxygen species plays important roles in cellular signal transduction and homeostatic regulation. Precise detection of ONOO&#8208; in biological systems is vital for exploring its physiological and pathological function. Among numerous detection methods, fluorescence imaging technology using fluorescent probe offers some advantages, including simple operation, high sensitivity and selectivity, real&#8208;time and non&#8208;destructive detection. In particular, ratiometric fluorescent probes, in which the built&#8208;in calibration of the two emission bands prevents interference from the biological environment, have been extensively employed to monitor the fluctuation of bioactive species. In this review, we will discuss the small&#8208;molecule ratiometric fluorescent probes for ONOO&#8208; in live cells or in vivo, which involves the chemical structures, response mechanism and biological applications. Moreover, the challenges and future prospects of ONOO&#8208; responsive ratiometric fluorescent probe are also proposed.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>As the 21  st  century unfolds with rapid changes, new challenges in research and development emerge. These new challenges prompted us to repurpose our HPLC&#8208;A platform that was previously used in solid phase glycan synthesis to a solution phase batch synthesis described herein.

To enable sequential synthesis of multiple oligosaccharides with the single press of a button, we supplemented our system with a four&#8208;way split valve and an automated fraction collector. This enabled the operator to load all reagents and all reactants in the autosampler, press the button to start the repetitive automation sequence, leave the lab, and upon return find products of multiple reactions ready for purification, analysis, and subsequent application</dc:description>

         <title>The Unexpected Helical Supramolecular Assembly of a Simple Achiral Acetamide Tecton Generates Selective Water Channels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water wire transfer: A simple achiral hydrated acetamide self&#8208;organizes into a chiral channel with highly mobile water molecules. The crystalline architecture displays breathing behavior near room temperature with fully reversible release and re&#8208;uptake of water molecules. The water transport is very efficient compared to that with previously reported artificial water channels and has a very good selectivity against NaCl; it could therefore be an efficient candidate for desalination processes.







Abstract
Achiral 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;N&#8208;(diphenylmethyl)acetamide (HNDPA) crystallizes in the P61 chiral space group as a hydrate, building up permeable chiral crystalline helical water channels. The crystallization&#8208;driven chiral self&#8208;resolution process is highly robust, with the same air&#8208;stable crystalline form readily obtained under a variety of conditions. Interestingly, the HNDPA supramolecular helix inner pore is filled by a helical water wire. The whole edifice is mainly stabilized by robust hydrogen bonds involving the HNDPA amide bonds and CH&#8230;&#960; interactions between the HNDPA phenyl groups. The crystalline structure shows breathing behavior, with completely reversible release and re&#8208;uptake of water inside the chiral channel under ambient conditions. Importantly, the HNDPA channel is able to transport water very efficiently and selectively under biomimetic conditions. With a permeability per channel of 3.3 million water molecules per second in large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) and total selectivity against NaCl, the HNDPA channel is a very promising functional nanomaterial for future applications.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Water wire transfer&lt;/b&gt;: A simple achiral hydrated acetamide self-organizes into a chiral channel with highly mobile water molecules. The crystalline architecture displays breathing behavior near room temperature with fully reversible release and re-uptake of water molecules. The water transport is very efficient compared to that with previously reported artificial water channels and has a very good selectivity against NaCl; it could therefore be an efficient candidate for desalination processes.

         <title>Enantioselective Cytotoxicity of Chiral Diphosphine Ruthenium(II) Complexes Against Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chiral cationic diphosphine ruthenium(II) complexes [RuX(CO)(PP)(phen)]Y (X, Y=carboxylates, thioacetate, PP=(R,R)&#8208; or (S,S)&#8208;Skewphos), isolated as single stereoisomers, inhibit cancer cell proliferation and colonization with EC50 values ranging from 2.8 to 0.04&#8197;&#956;M, the (R,R)&#8208;enantiomers being up to 14 times more active than the (S,S) ones. In water, the (S)&#8208;cysteine and GSH adducts are easily formed from the carboxylate derivatives via aquo complexes.







Abstract
The chiral cationic complex [Ru(&#951;1&#8208;OAc)(CO)((R,R)&#8208;Skewphos)(phen)]OAc (2R), isolated from reaction of [Ru(&#951;1&#8208;OAc)(&#951;2&#8208;OAc)(R,R)&#8208;Skewphos)(CO)] (1R) with phen, reacts with NaOPiv and KSAc affording [RuX(CO)((R,R)&#8208;Skewphos)(phen)]Y (X=Y=OPiv 3R; X=SAc, Y=OAc 4R). The corresponding enantiomers 2S&#8208;4S have been obtained from 1S containing (S,S)&#8208;Skewphos. Reaction of 2R and 2S with (S)&#8208;cysteine and NaPF6 at pH=9 gives the diastereoisomers [Ru((S)&#8208;Cys)(CO)(PP)(phen)]PF6 (PP=(R,R)&#8208;Skewphos 2R&#8208;Cys; (S,S)&#8208;Skewphos 2S&#8208;Cys). The DFT energetic profile for 2R with (S)&#8208;cysteine in H2O indicates that aquo and hydroxo species are involved in formation of 2R&#8208;Cys. The stability of the ruthenium complexes in 0.9&#8201;% w/v NaCl solution, PBS and complete DMEM medium, as well as their n&#8208;octanol/water partition coefficient (logP), have been evaluated. The chiral complexes show high cytotoxic activity against SW1736, 8505&#8197;C, HCT&#8208;116 and A549&#8197;cell lines with EC50 values of 2.8&#8211;0.04&#8197;&#956;M. The (R,R)&#8208;Skewphos derivatives show higher cytotoxicity compared to their enantiomers, 4R (EC50=0.04&#8197;&#956;M) being 14 times more cytotoxic than 4S against the anaplastic thyroid cancer 8505&#8197;C cell line.

         <title>Cation&#8208;&#960; Interactions between a Noble Metal and a Polyfunctional Aromatic Ligand: Ag+(benzylamine)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
IR multiple photon dissociation spectroscopy unveils the structure of the Ag+(benzylamine) complex (Ag+(BA)), presenting a N&#8208;Ag+&#8208;&#960; chelate coordination involving both the amino nitrogen and the phenyl &#960;&#8208;system. The gas&#8208;phase reactivity of Ag+(BA) with neutral molecular ligands (L) confirms N&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;binding affinity and indicates an augmented silver coordination in the Ag+(BA)(L) adduct.







Abstract
The structure of an isolated Ag+(benzylamine) complex is investigated by infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy complemented with quantum chemical calculations of candidate geometries and their vibrational spectra, aiming to ascertain the role of competing cation&#8208;N and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions potentially offered by the polyfunctional ligand. The IRMPD spectrum has been recorded in the 800&#8211;1800&#8197;cm&#8722;1 fingerprint range using the IR free electron laser beamline coupled with an FT&#8208;ICR mass spectrometer at the Centre Laser Infrarouge d'Orsay (CLIO). The resulting IRMPD pattern points toward a chelate coordination (N&#8208;Ag+&#8208;&#960;) involving both the amino nitrogen atom and the aromatic &#960;&#8208;system of the phenyl ring. The gas&#8208;phase reactivity of Ag+(benzylamine) with a neutral molecular ligand (L) possessing either an amino/aza functionality or an aryl group confirms N&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;binding affinity and suggests an augmented silver coordination in the product adduct ion

         <title>Remote Effect from Boron Cluster: Tunable Photophysical Properties of o&#8208;Carborane&#8208;Based Luminogens</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new molecular design strategy that attaches the o&#8208;carborane group to the remote side of luminogens was proposed. The remote effect from the o&#8208;carboranyl unit on the end of luminogens could significantly modulate the photophysical properties in both solution and the solid state. The carborane&#8208;substituted luminogens show lower luminescence efficiency in solution and longer emission wavelength in the solid state in contrast to those of model compounds.







Abstract
We proposed a new molecular design strategy that the o&#8208;carboranyl group is attached as &#8220;an innocent unit&#8221; to the remote side of luminogens to tune photophysical properties. To verify this strategy, two o&#8208;carborane&#8208;based compounds with asymmetric molecular geometry were designed and synthesized. Photophysical properties of o&#8208;carborane&#8208;based luminogens were investigated on the basis of UV&#8208;Vis spectra, photoluminescence spectra, crystal structure analysis and theoretical calculations. The results indicate that the o&#8208;carboranyl group has a slight effect on the energy gap between the ground state (S0) and the first excited state (S1) in the solution state but a significant effect on the energy gap between S0 and S1 in the solid state. Besides, the radiative and non&#8208;radiative transition processes are modulated by the o&#8208;carboranyl unit. This leads to emission quenching in the solution state but an enhanced luminous efficiency in the aggregate state with a typical aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) property.

         <title>A&#160;porous sulfonated 2D zirconium metal&#8208;organic framework as a robust platform for proton conduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using the strategy of pre&#8208;assembly chlorosulfonation applied to a linker precursor, the first&#160;sulfonated zirconium metal&#8208;organic framework (JUK&#8208;14) with two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structure, was synthesized. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals that the material is built of Zr  6  O  4  (OH)  4  (COO)  8  oxoclusters, doubly 4&#8208;connected by angular dicarboxylates, and stacked in layers spaced 1.5 nm apart by the presence of sulfonic groups. JUK&#8208;14 exhibits excellent hydrothermal stability, permanent porosity confirmed by gas adsorption studies, and shows high (&gt;10  &#8208;4  S/cm) and low (&lt;10  &#8208;8  S/cm) proton conductivity under humidified and anhydrous conditions, respectively. Post&#8208;synthesis inclusion of imidazole improves the overall conductivity increasing it to 1.7&#215;10  &#8208;3  S/cm at 60  o  C and 90% relative humidity, and by 3 orders of magnitude at 160  o  C. The combination of 2D porous nature with robustness of zirconium MOFs offers new opportunities for exploration of the material towards energy and environmental applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulated Synthesis of Self&#8208;Standing Covalent Organic Framework Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The weak interaction of covalent organic framework (COF) nanoparticles makes the preparation of self&#8208;standing COF &#64257;lms difficult. Herein, we report a modulated strategy for the facile synthesis of self&#8208;standing COF films with good crystallinity and tunable thickness. As compared with the non&#8208;modulated approach, the modulated strategy changes the COF morphology from nanoparticles to nanofibers, enabling the facile preparation of self&#8208;standing COF films with improved mechanical properties. The Young's modulus of the self&#8208;standing COF film obtained via the modulated strategy could increase by 26 times. Moreover, self&#8208;standing LZU&#8208;8 film can be used as a membrane for efficient removal of 99% mercury ions from aqueous solution. Our results open up a new approach to prepare self&#8208;standing COF thin &#64257;lms for practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Driving the active site incorporation in zeolitic materials via the organic structure&#8208;directing agent through development of H&#8208;bonds with hydroxyl groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work we use (1  S  ,2  S  )&#8208;N&#8208;methyl&#8208;pseudoephedrine (MPS) as organic structure&#8208;directing agent (OSDA) for the synthesis of Mg&#8208;doped nanoporous aluminophosphates. This molecule displays a particular conformational behavior, where the presence of H&#8208;bond donor and acceptor groups provide a rigid conformational space with one asymmetric conformation preferentially occurring. MPS drives the crystallization of Mg&#8208;containing AFI materials. Characterization of these materials shows that the OSDA incorporate as protonated species, arranged as head&#8208;to&#8208;tail monomers. Combination of three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction with high&#8208;resolution synchrotron powder X&#8208;ray diffraction allowed to locate both the Mg and the organic species. Interestingly, results showed that the spatial incorporation of Mg is driven by the hydroxyl groups of the organic cation through the development of H&#8208;bonds with negatively&#8208;charged MgO  4  tetrahedra. Thus, our work demonstrates that H&#8208;bond forming groups can be used to drive the spatial incorporation of low&#8208;valent dopants within zeolitic frameworks, a highly desired aim in order to control their catalytic activity and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Neutron diffraction study of indole solvation in deep eutectic systems of choline chloride, malic acid, and water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deep eutectic systems are currently under intense investigation to replace traditional organic solvents in a range of syntheses. Here, indole in choline chloride&#8208;malic acid deep eutectic solvent (DES) was studied as a function of water content, to identify solute interactions with the DES which affect heterocycle reactivity and selectivity, and as a proxy for biomolecule solvation. Empirical Potential Structure Refinement models of neutron diffraction data showed [Cholinium]  +  cations associate strongly with the indole &#960;&#8208;system due to electrostatics, whereas malic acid is only weakly associated. Trace water is sequestered into the DES, and does not interact strongly with indole. When water is added to the DES, it does not interact with the indole &#960;&#8208;system but is exclusively in&#8208;plane with the heterocyclic rings, forming strong H&#8208;bonds with the &#8208;NH group, and also weak H&#8208;bonds and thus prominent hydrophobic hydration of the indole aromatic region, which could direct selectivity in reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Borylation of Acyl Chlorides with an Alkoxy Diboron Reagent: A Facile Route to Acylboron Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein the copper&#8208;catalyzed borylation of readily available acyl chlorides with bis(pinacolato)diboron (B2pin2) or bis(neopentane glycolato)diboron (B2neop2) which provides stable potassium acyltrifluoroborates (KATs) in good yields from the acylboronate esters. A variety of functional groups are tolerated under the mild reaction conditions (room temperature) and substrates containing different carbon&#8208;skeletons, such as aryl, heteroaryl and primary, secondary, tertiary alkyl are applicable. Acyl N&#8208;methyliminodiacetic acid (MIDA) boronates can also been accessed by modification of the workup procedures. This process is scalable and also amenable to the late&#8208;stage conversion of carboxylic acid&#8208;containing drugs into their acylboron analogues, which have been challenging to prepare previously. A catalytic mechanism is proposed based on in situ monitoring of the reaction between p&#8208;toluoyl chloride and an NHC&#8208;copper(I) boryl complex as well as the isolation of an unusual lithium acylBpinOBpin compound&#160;as a key intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactions of Mesityl Azide with Ferrocene&#8208;Based N&#8208;Heterocyclic Germylenes, Stannylenes and Plumbylenes, Including PPh2&#8208;Functionalised Congeners</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactivity of ferrocene&#8208;based N&#8208;heterocyclic tetrylenes [{Fe(&#951;  5  &#8208;C  5  H  4  &#8208;NSi  t  BuMe  2  )  2  }E] (E = Ge, Sn, Pb) towards mesityl azide (MesN  3  ) is compared with that of PPh  2  &#8208;functionalised congeners exhibiting two possible reactions sites, viz. the E  II  and P  III  atom.

         <title>Electrochemistry and Reactivity of Chelation&#8208;stabilized Hypervalent Bromine(III) Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hypervalent bromine(III) reagents possess a higher electrophilicity and a stronger oxidizing power compared to their iodine(III) counterparts. Despite the superior reactivity, bromine(III) reagents have a reputation of hard&#8208;to&#8208;control and difficult&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize compounds. This is partly due to their low stability, and partly because their synthesis typically relies on the use of the toxic and highly reactive BrF  3  as a precursor. Recently, we proposed chelation&#8208;stabilized hypervalent bromine(III) compounds as a possible solution to both problems. First, they can be conveniently prepared by electro&#8208;oxidation of the corresponding bromoarenes. Second, the chelation endows bromine(III) species with increased stability while retaining sufficient reactivity, comparable to that of iodine(III) counterparts. Finally, their intrinsic reactivity can be unlocked in the presence of acids. Herein, an in&#8208;depth mechanistic study of both the electrochemical generation and the reactivity of the bromine(III) compounds is disclosed, with implications for known applications and future developments in the field.</dc:description>

         <title>Chlorine substituted N&#8208;heteroacene analogues acting as organic semiconductors for solution&#8208;processed n&#8208;type organic field&#8208;effect transistors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High performance solution processable n&#8208;type organic semiconductor is an essential element to realize low&#8208;cost, all organic and flexible composite logic circuits. In the design of n&#8208;type semiconducting materials, tuning the LUMO level of compounds is a key point. As a strong electron withdrawing unit, the introduction of chlorine atom into the chemical structure can increase the electron affinity of the material and reduce the LUMO energy level. Here, a series chlorine substituted N&#8208;heteroacene analogues of 6,7,8,9&#8208;tetrachloro&#8208;4,11&#8208;bis(4&#8208;((2&#8208;ethylhexyl)oxy)phenyl)&#8208;[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4&#8208;b]phenazine (O4Cl), 6,7,8,9&#8208;tetrachloro&#8208;4,11&#8208;bis(4&#8208;((2&#8208;ethylhexyl)thio)phenyl)&#8208;[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4&#8208;b]phenazine (S4Cl), 1,2,3,4,8,9,10,11&#8208;octachloro&#8208;6,13&#8208;bis(4&#8208;((2&#8208;ethylhexyl)oxy)phenyl)quinoxalino[2,3&#8208;b]phenazine (8Cl) and 12Cl have been synthesized and characterized. Solution&#8208;processed organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) based on these four compounds exhibit good electron mobilities of 0.04 cm  2  V  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  , 0.01 cm  2  V  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  , 2 &#215; 10  &#8208;3  cm  2  V  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  and 3 &#215; 10  &#8208;3  cm  2  V  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  , respectively, under ambient conditions.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A catalytic enantioselective amination of  &#946;  &#8208;keto esters using (  S  )&#8208;BINOL chiral calcium phosphate has been developed. The reaction produces chiral  &#945;  &#8208;amino&#8208;  &#946;  &#8208;keto ester derivatives in most cases with moderate to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99%) and good yields (up to 99%). This mild synthetic method highlights a low catalyst loading and high catalytic efficiency. When the substrate backbone was changed to 1&#8208;tetralone&#8208;derived  &#946;  &#8208;keto esters, unexpectedly high yields of selective redox products were obtained. The practicality of the reaction was realized by a scale up without any significant loss in the enantioselectivity and yield. Chiral calcium phosphate was successfully recovered and reused for four runs, indicating its stability and high catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Organophotocatalytic Telescoped Synthesis of a Chiral Privileged Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient in&#8208;flow catalytic enantioselective organophotoredox alkylation of aldehydes has been successfully developed (up to 98&#8201;% e.e.) and applied to the fully telescoped synthesis of a chiral active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), consisting of four units of operation: in&#8208;flow asymmetric benzylation, inline continuous work&#8208;up, neutralisation and oxidative amidation. By using flow technologies, the productivity was increased by almost 200 times compared to the batch reaction.







Abstract
The continuous flow, enantioselective, organophotoredox catalytic asymmetric alkylation of aldehydes was studied, by using a homemade, custom&#8208;designed photoreactor for reactions under cryogenic conditions. Going from microfluidic conditions up to a 10&#8197;mL mesofluidic reactor, an increase of productivity by almost 18000&#8201;% compared to the batch reaction was demonstrated. Finally, for the first time, a stereoselective photoredox organocatalytic continuous flow reaction in a fully telescoped process for an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API)synthesis was successfully achieved. The final process consists of four units of operation: visible light&#8208;driven asymmetric catalytic benzylation under continuous flow, inline continuous work&#8208;up, neutralisation and a final oxidative amidation step afforded the pharmaceutically active molecule in 95&#8201;% e.e.

         <title>Four&#8208;Component Ugi Reaction for Optical Chirality Sensing and Surface Nanoengineering of Chiral Self&#8208;Assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The four&#8208;component Ugi reaction was successfully utilized in the optical ee% sensing of chiral amines. An intramolecular folded structure was employed to boost the CD signal. Optical sensing of amines was applicable in a general and precise manner to a variety of substrates, from synthetic to natural amines. In aqueous media, conjugation of amine&#8208;bearing dyes enables fluorescent visualization yet without changing the pristine morphology, providing a promising strategy for surface engineering of soft assemblies.







Abstract
Using green chemistry to control chirality at hierarchical levels as well as chiroptical activities endows with new opportunities to the development of multiple functions. Here, the four&#8208;component Ugi reaction is introduced for the general and precise optical chirality sensing of amines as well as the surface nanoengineering of chiral soft self&#8208;assemblies. To overcome the relatively weak Cotton effects, direct synthesis of a folded peptide structure on a rotatable ferrocene core with axial chirality was accomplished from chiral amine, 1,1&#8217;&#8208;ferrocenyl dicarboxylic acid, formaldehyde and isocyanide. Enhanced Cotton effects benefiting from the folded structure allow for the precise and quantitative sensing of natural and synthetic chiral amines covering alkyl, aromatic amines and amino acid derivatives. In addition, aqueous reaction enables the modification of amine&#8208;bearing dye to microfibers self&#8208;assembled from &#960;&#8208;conjugated amino acids. Surface dye&#8208;modification via Ugi reaction barely changes the pristine morphology, showing non&#8208;invasive properties in contrast to dye staining, which is applicable in soft nano/microarchitectures from self&#8208;assembly. This work which combines the four&#8208;component Ugi reaction to enable precise ee% detection and surface nanoengineering of soft chiral assemblies sheds light on the advanced application of green chemistry to chirality science.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The four-component Ugi reaction&lt;/b&gt; was successfully utilized in the optical ee% sensing of chiral amines. An intramolecular folded structure was employed to boost the CD signal. Optical sensing of amines was applicable in a general and precise manner to a variety of substrates, from synthetic to natural amines. In aqueous media, conjugation of amine-bearing dyes enables fluorescent visualization yet without changing the pristine morphology, providing a promising strategy for surface engineering of soft assemblies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using green chemistry to control chirality at hierarchical levels as well as chiroptical activities endows with new opportunities to the development of multiple functions. Here, the four-component Ugi reaction is introduced for the general and precise optical chirality sensing of amines as well as the surface nanoengineering of chiral soft self-assemblies. To overcome the relatively weak Cotton effects, direct synthesis of a folded peptide structure on a rotatable ferrocene core with axial chirality was accomplished from chiral amine, 1,1&#8217;-ferrocenyl dicarboxylic acid, formaldehyde and isocyanide. Enhanced Cotton effects benefiting from the folded structure allow for the precise and quantitative sensing of natural and synthetic chiral amines covering alkyl, aromatic amines and amino acid derivatives. In addition, aqueous reaction enables the modification of amine-bearing dye to microfibers self-assembled from &#960;-conjugated amino acids. Surface dye-modification via Ugi reaction barely changes the pristine morphology, showing non-invasive properties in contrast to dye staining, which is applicable in soft nano/microarchitectures from self-assembly. This work which combines the four-component Ugi reaction to enable precise ee% detection and surface nanoengineering of soft chiral assemblies sheds light on the advanced application of green chemistry to chirality science.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct In Situ Vertical Growth of Interlaced Mesoporous NiO Nanosheets on Carbon Felt for Electrocatalytic Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel interlaced mesoporous NiO NSs@CF electrochemical catalyst was prepared using a direct in&#8197;situ vertical growth method, in which NiO formed mesoporous nanosheets with a pore size of 15&#8197;nm and a thickness of &#8764;30&#8197;nm. This binder&#8208;free electrode exhibited a superior NH3 yield of 71.3&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8197;mg&#8722;1cat. and a FE of 17.9&#8201;% at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. RHE.







Abstract
Metal oxide nanomaterials directly grown on conductive substrates are optimal electrode materials because their structures allow for rapid ion and electron transport and thereby reduce internal resistance in the electrode. The development of such binder&#8208;free, self&#8208;supporting electrodes is of great significance for applications in electrocatalysis. In this work, a simple hydrothermal in&#8197;situ self&#8208;assembly reaction and annealing process was developed to prepare three kinds of nickel oxide @ carbon felt (NiO@CF) nanocomposites with different morphologies. The influence of different precipitators (strong or weak bases) on the morphology of the resulting nano&#8208;sized nickel oxide nanocomposites was investigated. The microstructures of the NiO@CF samples were characterized with field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). When ammonia was used as the precipitator, NiO grew vertically on the surface of the carbon felt and formed a mesoporous nanosheet&#8208;like structure (NiO NSs@CF). As an electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (e&#8208;NRR) electrode, the NiO NSs@CF sample showed an excellent NH3 yield (71.3&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8197;mg&#8722;1cat.) and Faradaic efficiency (17.9&#8201;% at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. RHE) in 0.1&#8197;M Na2SO4. The good performance was attributed to the vertical interleaved mesoporous sheet&#8208;like structure (with the pore size of 15&#8197;nm and the thickness of &#8764;30&#8197;nm) and the relatively high concentration of oxygen vacancies. First&#8208;principles calculations with strong on&#8208;site Coulomb interactions demonstrated that the presence of oxygen vacancy on NiO sample leads to a significantly stronger N binding over the surface, benefiting for the nitrogen gas adsorption and reduction. The e&#8208;NRR performance of this binder&#8208;free, flexible electrode material is superior to that of other reported nickel&#8208;based nanomaterials. This study highlights the potential of such binder&#8208;free carbon felt electrodes for use in e&#8208;NRR that could meet the needs of industrial production.

         <title>An Orthogonal Dynamic Covalent Chemistry Tool for Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Cyclic Oligochalcogenides on Detachable Helical Peptide Templates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recyclable with orthogonal dynamic covalent semicarbazone chemistry, 310 helical peptide templates are introduced as a general chemistry tool to enable and tame unfavorable ring&#8208;opening polymerizations by dynamic covalent disulfide and diselenide exchange cascades.







Abstract
A model system is introduced as a general tool to elaborate on orthogonal templation of dynamic covalent ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ODC&#8208;TROP). The tool consists of 310 helical peptides as unprecedented templates and semicarbazones as orthogonal dynamic covalent linkers. With difficult&#8208;to&#8208;control 1,2&#8208;dithiolanes, ODC&#8208;TROP on the level of short model oligomers occurs with high templation efficiency, increasing and diminishing upon helix stabilization and denaturation, respectively. Further, an anti&#8208;templated conjugate with mispositioned monomers gave reduced templation upon helix twisting. Even with the &#8220;unpolymerizable&#8221; 1,2&#8208;diselenolanes, initial studies already afford mild templation efficiency. These proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle results promise that the here introduced tool, recyclable and enabling late&#8208;stage side chain modification, will be useful to realize ODC&#8208;TROP of intractable or unknown cyclic dynamic covalent monomers for dynamer materials as well as cellular uptake and signaling applications.

         <title>Development of a Fully Continuous&#8208;Flow Approach Towards Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Tetrahydroprotoberberine Natural Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully continuous flow approach towards asymmetric total synthesis of four natural tetrahydroprotoberberine alkaloids, was developed through a concise linear sequence involving four chemical transformations and three on&#8208;line work&#8208;up processes without any intermediate purification. The overall yields and enantioselectivities obtained in this novel integrated flow platform were up to 50&#8201;% and 92&#8201;%ee, respectively, in a total residence time of 32.5&#8197;min.







Abstract
Continuous flow synthetic technologies had been widely applied in the total synthesis in the past few decades. Fully continuous flow synthesis is still extremely focused on multi&#8208;step synthesis of complex natural pharmaceutical molecules. Thus, the development of fully continuous flow total synthesis of natural products is in demand but challenging. Herein, we demonstrated the first fully continuous flow approach towards asymmetric total synthesis of natural tetrahydroprotoberberine alkaloids, (&#8722;)&#8208;isocanadine, (&#8722;)&#8208;tetrahydropseudocoptisine, (&#8722;)&#8208;stylopine and (&#8722;)&#8208;nandinine. This method features a concise linear sequence involving four chemical transformations and three on&#8208;line work&#8208;up processing in an integrated flow platform, without any intermediate purification. The overall yield and enantioselectivity of this four&#8208;step continuous flow chemistry were up to 50&#8201;% and 92&#8201;%ee, respectively, in a total residence time of 32.5&#8197;min, corresponding to a throughput of 145&#8197;mg/h.

         <title>Reactivity of Xantphos&#8208;Type Rhodium Complexes Towards SF4: SF3 Versus SF2 Complex Generation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
S&#8722;F bond activation: Treatment of the xantphos&#8208;type rhodium complex [Rh(Me)(tBuxanPOP)] with SF4 gave the &#955;4&#8208;trifluorosulfanyl complex [Rh(Me)(SF3)(tBuxanPOP)][SF5]. Its molecular structure in the solid state reveals a Rh&#8722;F interaction of the SF3 ligand with the metal center. Further reactions with Lewis acids and chlorine sources have been investigated.







Abstract
S&#8722;F&#8208;bond activation of sulfur tetrafluoride at [Rh(Cl)(tBuxanPOP)] (1; tBuxanPOP=9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;bis&#8208;(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphino)&#8208;xanthene) led to the formation of the cationic complex [Rh(F)(Cl)(SF2)(tBuxanPOP)][SF5] (2&#8201;a) together with trans&#8208;[Rh(Cl)(F)2(tBuxanPOP)] (3) and cis&#8208;[Rh(Cl)2(F)(tBuxanPOP)] (4) which both could also be obtained by the reaction of SF5Cl with 1. In contrast to that, the conversion of SF4 at the methyl complex [Rh(Me)(tBuxanPOP)] (5) gave the isolable and room&#8208;temperature stable cationic &#955;4&#8208;trifluorosulfanyl complex [Rh(Me)(SF3)(tBuxanPOP)][SF5] (6). Treatment of 6 with the Lewis acids BF3 or AsF5 produced the dicationic difluorosulfanyl complex [Rh(Me)(SF2)(tBuxanPOP)][BF4]2 (8&#8201;a) or [Rh(Me)(SF2)(tBuxanPOP)][AsF6]2 (8&#8201;b), respectively. Refluorination of 8&#8201;a was possible with the use of dimethylamine giving [Rh(Me)(SF3)(tBuxanPOP)][BF4] (9). A reaction of 6 with trichloroisocyanuric acid (TClCA) gave the fluorido complex [Rh(F)(Cl)(SF2)(tBuxanPOP)][Cl] (2&#8201;b) together with chloromethane and SF5Cl.

         <title>Genuine Pores in a Stable Zinc Phosphite for High H2 Adsorption and CO2 Capture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of crystalline zinc phosphite incorporating thio&#8208;functionalized O&#8208;donor and tetradentate N&#8208;donor building blocks has been synthesized and characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Interestingly, this compound possessed not only uncommon structural features but also good capture for H2O, CO2, CO, CH4, N2, and H2 gases. The possible adsorption sites are discussed, and CO2 gas selectivity at 298&#8197;K is reported.







Abstract
An uncommon example of stable mixed&#8208;ligand zinc phosphite with genuine pores has been synthesized by using zinc metal, inorganic phosphite acid, thio&#8208;functionalized O&#8208;donor (2,5&#8208;thiophenedicarboxylate, TPDC), and tetradentate N&#8208;donor [1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrakis(imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;ylmethyl)benzene, TIMB] units assembled into one crystalline structure according to a hydro(solvo)thermal method. This is a very rare case of a metal phosphite incorporating both N&#8208; and O&#8208;donor ligands. The tetradentate TIMB linker bound to zinc atoms of the isolated zincophosphite hexamers to form a 3D open&#8208;framework structure by crosslinking structural components of 1D chains and 2D layers. Here, the TPDC ligand acts as a monodentate binding model to functionalize its porous structure with the uncoordinated S atom and COO&#8722; group. Interestingly, this compound demonstrates the highest H2 storage capacity among organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal phosphates (and phosphites), and a good CO2 capture at 298&#8197;K compared with the majority of crystalline materials. The possible adsorption sites and selectivity for CO2 over H2, N2, and CO at 298&#8197;K were calculated by using density functional theory (DFT), the ideal adsorption solution theory (IAST), and fitting experimental pure&#8208;component adsorption data.

         <title>Programming Rapid Functional Group Diversification into a Solid&#8208;State Reaction: Aryl Nitriles for Self&#8208;Assembly, Click Reactivity, and Discovery of Coexisting Supramolecular Synthons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method to rapidly diversify molecules formed in organic crystals is introduced with aryl nitriles serving as a novel dual role as both hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;acceptors and modifiable organic groups. The discovery of coexisting supramolecular synthons in the same crystal is also described.&#160; The general concept is demonstrated using a bis(aryl nitrile) alkene that undergoes a hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;directed intermolecular [2+2] photodimerization to form a tetra(aryl nitrile)cyclobutane. The product is readily converted by Click reactivity to a tetra(aryl tetrazole) and hydrolysis to a tetra(aryl carboxylic acid). The integration of aryl nitriles into solid&#8208;state reactions opens broad avenues to post&#8208;modify products formed in crystalline solids for rapid diversification.</dc:description>

         <title>Homolytic X&#8208;H Bond Cleavage at a Gold(III) Hydroxide: Insights into One&#8208;Electron Events at Gold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C(sp  3  )&#8208;H and O&#8208;H bond breaking steps in the oxidation of 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene and phenol by a Au(III)&#8208;OH complex were studied computationally. The analysis reveals that for both types of bonds the initial X&#8208;H cleavage step follows a concerted proton coupled electron transfer step (cPCET), reflecting electron transfer from the substrate directly to the Au(III) center and proton transfer to the Au&#8208;bound oxygen. This mechanistic picture is distinct from the analogous formal Cu(III)&#8208;OH complexes studied by the Tolman group (  J. Am. Chem. Soc.  2019  , 141, 17236&#8722;17244  ), which proceed  via  hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) for C&#8208;H bonds and cPCET for O&#8208;H bonds. Hence, care should be taken when transferring concepts between Cu&#8208;OH and Au&#8208;OH species. Furthermore, the ability of Au&#8208;OH complexes to perform cPCET suggests further possibilities for one&#8208;electron chemistry at the Au center, for which only limited examples exist.</dc:description>

         <title>Controllable Zeolite AST Crystallization: Between Classical and Reversed Crystal Growth</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A truly reversed crystal growth mode in which the crystallization starts at the surface of a spherically amorphous aggregate and then proceeds towards its center is described. The fundamental function of the structure&#8208;directing agent (SDA) controlling the crystallization pathway is uncovered. Thus, the crystallization pathway can be &#8220;switched&#8221; between classical and reversed crystal growth by tuning the concentration of the SDA.







Abstract
Crystal growth mechanisms govern a wide range of properties of crystalline materials. Reversed crystal growth is one of the nonclassical mechanisms observed in many materials. However, the reversed crystallization starting from amorphous aggregates and the key factors driving this growth remain elusive. Here, we describe a characteristic model of reversed crystal growth representing the inner structure and crystallinity development of aggregates studied by microscopy and nano X&#8208;ray computed tomography. By adjusting the synthesis conditions, the fundamental function of the structure&#8208;directing agent, which determines the crystallization pathway, was revealed. As a result, the crystal growth mode can be &#8220;switched&#8221; from the classical route at a low ratio of SDA/framework elements to reversed growth at a high ratio. Our findings provide further insights into crystal growth control, which is crucial for improving synthesis protocols and designing various forms of crystalline materials.

Weaker under pressure: The phase transitions and magnetic properties of MAgF3 perovskites at pressures up to 100&#8197;GPa have been elucidated for the first time by DFT calculations. The emerging post&#8208;perovskite structures feature much weaker antiferromagnetic interactions than the parent perovskites. The magneto&#8208;structural behavior of the AgII compounds differs substantially from that of their CuII siblings due to the pronounced covalence of Ag&#8722;F bonds.







Abstract
Pressure&#8208;induced phase transitions of MIAgIIF3 perovskites (M=K, Rb, Cs) have been predicted theoretically for the first time for pressures up to 100&#8197;GPa. The sequence of phase transitions for M=K and Rb consists of a transition from orthorhombic to monoclinic and back to orthorhombic, associated with progressive bending of infinite chains of corner&#8208;sharing [AgF6]4&#8722; octahedra and their mutual approach through secondary Ag&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F contacts. In stark contrast, only a single phase transition (tetragonal&#8594;triclinic) is predicted for CsAgF3; this is associated with substantial deformation of the Jahn&#8211;Teller&#8208;distorted first coordination sphere of AgII and association of the infinite [AgF6]4&#8722; chains into a polymeric sublattice. The phase transitions markedly decrease the coupling strength of intra&#8208;chain antiferromagnetic superexchange in MAgF3 hosts lattices.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Difluoromethylations of Aryl Boronic Acids, Halides, and Pseudohalides with ICF2H Generated ex Situ</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ex&#8208;situ process for the generation of stoichiometric difluoroiodomethane and its application to a two&#8208;step catalytic difluoromethylation of aryl (pseudo)halides is identified. The method exhibits good functional&#8208;group tolerance and is adaptable to isotope labeling, as exemplified by the preparation of deuteriodifluoromethyl arenes.







Abstract
An expedient ex&#8208;situ generation of difluoroiodomethane (DFIM) and its immediate use in a Pd&#8208;catalyzed difluoromethylation of aryl boronic acids and ester derivatives in a two&#8208;chamber reactor is reported. Heating a solution of bromodifluoroacetic acid with sodium iodide in sulfolane proved to be effective for the generation of near stoichiometric amounts of DFIM for the ensuing catalytic coupling step. A two&#8208;step difluoromethylation of aryl (pseudo)halides with tetrahydroxydiboron as a low&#8208;cost reducing agent, both promoted by Pd catalysis, proved effective to install this fluorine&#8208;containing C1 group onto several pharmaceutically relevant molecules. Finally, the method proved adaptable to deuterium incorporation by simply adding D2O to the DFIM&#8208;generating chamber.

         <title>Biomimetic Peptide Catalytic Bond&#8208;Forming Utilizing a Mild Br&#248;nsted Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since the global peptide drug market demand has been predicted to increase, highly efficient and inexpensive mass scale peptides are required. However, the production process raises questions about the cost of energy input, scale&#8208;up production, raw materials, and solvents treatment. This paper introduces 2 methods for the 2&#8208;4 mer oligopeptides bond formation for batch reaction utilizing 50&#8208;100 mol% of a mild Br&#248;nsted acid under the mild condition. One of the methods has been capably adapted to flow synthesis at room temperature using organic solvents with boiling points below 100 . The method applies the tert&#8208;butoxycarbonyl amino methoxy group, forming the desired dipeptide without solvent at mild temperatures. Furthermore, the conversion of the carboxylic acid leaving the group to phenyl ester promotes peptide bond formation, and the reaction were applied to di, tri, and tetrapeptide bond formation in excellent yield without notable racemization at ambient temperature (up to &gt;99% yield and 99:1 dr). And the end, this study proposes this new production method to overcome the limited scale&#8208;up production by reaction device scale: liquid phase biomimetic catalytic peptide flow synthesis utilizing a mild Br&#248;nsted acid.</dc:description>

         <title>1&#8208;(Azidomethyl)&#8208;5H&#8208;tetrazole &#8211; a Powerful New Ligand for Highly Energetic Coordination Compounds</title>

         <dc:description>Highly energetic 1&#8208;(azidomethyl)&#8208;5  H  &#8208;tetrazole (  AzMT  ,  3  ) is synthesized and characterized. This completes the series of 1&#8208;(azidoalkyl)&#8208;5  H  &#8208;tetrazoles represented by 1&#8208;(azidoethyl)&#8208;5  H  &#8208;tetrazole (AET) and 1&#8208;(azidopropyl)&#8208;5  H  &#8208;tetrazole (APT). AzMT is thoroughly analyzed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments, elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy and multinuclear (  1  H,  13  C,  14  N,  15  N) NMR measurements. Several ECCs of 3d metals (Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn) and silver in combination with anions such as (per)chlorate, mono&#8208; and di&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;trinitrophenolate are prepared, giving insight on the coordination behavior of  AzMT  as ligand. The synthesized ECCs are also analyzed by X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments, elemental analysis, and IR spectroscopy. Differential thermal analysis for all compounds is conducted and the sensitivity towards external stimuli (impact, friction, and ESD) are measured. Due to the high enthalpy of formation of AzMT (+654.5 kJ mol  &#8722;1  ), some of the resulting coordination compounds are extremely sensitive, yet are able to undergo deflagration&#8208;to&#8208;detonation transition (DDT) and initiate pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN). Therefore, they are to be ranked as primary explosives.</dc:description>

         <title>Methyl Viologens of Bis&#8208;(4'&#8208;pyridylethynyl)arenes &#8208; Structures, Photophysical and Electrochemical Studies, and their Potential Application in Biology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of bis&#8208;(4'&#8208;pyridylethynyl)arenes (arene = benzene, tetrafluorobenzene, &amp; anthracene) were synthesized and their bis&#8208;  N  &#8208;methylpyridinium compounds were investigated as a class of &#960;&#8208;extended methyl viologens. Their structures were determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction, and their photophysical and electrochemical properties as well as their interactions with DNA/RNA were investigated. The dications showed bathochromic shifts in emission compared to the neutral compounds. The neutral compounds showed very small Stokes shifts, which are a little larger for the dications. The compounds showed very short fluorescence lifetimes (&lt; 4 ns). The neutral compound with an anthracene core has a quantum yield of almost unity. With stronger acceptors, the analogous dicationic&#160;compound showed a larger 2&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) cross&#8208;section than its neutral precursor. All of the dicationic compounds interact with DNA/RNA; while the compounds with benzene and tetrafluorobenzene cores bind in the grooves, the one with an anthracene core intercalates as a consequence of its large,&#160;aromatic linker moiety, and it aggregates within the polynucleotide when in excess over DNA/RNA. All cationic compounds showed highly specific CD spectra upon binding to ds&#8208;DNA/RNA, attributed to the rare case of forcing the planar, achiral molecule into a chiral rotamer, and negligible toxicity toward human cell lines at &#8804; 10 &#181;M concentrations. The anthracene&#8208;analogue exhibited intracellular accumulation within lysosomes, preventing its interaction with cellular DNA/RNA. However, cytotoxicity was evident at 1 &#181;M concentration upon exposure to light, due to singlet oxygen generation within cells. These&#160;features, in combination with its TPA properties, suggest it to be a promising lead compound for development of light&#8208;activated theranostic agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Hydrosilylation of gem&#8208;Difluorocyclopropenes Leading to a Stereochemical Study of the Silylated gem&#8208;Difluorocyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrosilylation of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropenes providing the chiral gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes is presented. The use of copper(I) chloride, chiral ligands including bidentate BINAPs and monodentate phosphoramidites, and silylborane Me2PhSi&#8208;Bpin accompanying NaOtBu in methanol was appropriate for the enantioselective hydrosilylation of the strained C=C double bond. Subsequent activation of the silyl groups in enantio&#8208;enriched gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes showed substantial reduction of the enantiopurity, indicating cleavage of the distal C&#8722;C bond.







Abstract
Optically active cyclopropanes have been widely investigated especially from the views of pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries, and substituting one of the methylenes with the difluoromethylene unit should be promising for developing novel biologically relevant compounds and functional materials. In this paper, the copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrosilylation of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropenes to provide the corresponding chiral gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes is presented. The use of copper(I) chloride, chiral ligands including bidentate BINAPs and monodentate phosphoramidites, and silylborane Me2PhSi&#8208;Bpin accompanying sodium tert&#8208;butoxide in methanol was appropriate for the enantioselective hydrosilylation of the strained C=C double bond, and the resultant chiral difluorinated three&#8208;membered ring was unambiguously characterized. Subsequent activation of the silyl groups in enantio&#8208;enriched gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes showed substantial reduction of the enantiopurity, indicating cleavage of the distal C&#8722;C bond leading to the transient acyclic intermediates.

         <title>Size Effects of the Anions in the Ionothermal Synthesis of Carbon Nitride Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Size effects: Ionothermal condensation of dicyandiamide in alkali halide salt melts leads to the formation of extended 2D, layered frameworks only in the presence of small halides such as chloride, and bromide. With increasing size of the alkali halide intercalate, stabilizing van der Waals interactions between extended, &#960;&#8208;conjugated triazine&#8208;based sheets are lost. The main, crystalline product from an alkali iodide eutectic was identified as melem hydrate, a heptazine (C6N7)&#8208;based, hydrogen&#8208;bonded, monoclinic solid.







Abstract
Semiconducting carbon nitride polymers are used in metal&#8208;free photocatalysts and in opto&#8208;electronic devices. Conventionally, they are obtained using thermal and ionothermal syntheses in inscrutable, closed systems and therefore, their condensation behavior is poorly understood. Here, the synthetic protocols and properties are compared for two types of carbon nitride materials &#8211; 2D layered poly(triazine imide) (PTI) and hydrogen&#8208;bonded melem hydrate &#8211; obtained from three low&#8208;melting salt eutectics taken from the systematic series of the alkali metal halides: LiCl/KCl, LiBr/KBr, and LiI/KI. The size of the anion plays a significant role in the formation process of the condensed carbon nitride polymers, and it suggests a strong templating effect. The smaller anions (chloride and bromide) become incorporated into triazine (C3N3)&#8208;based PTI frameworks. The larger iodide does not stabilize the formation of a triazine&#8208;based polymer, but instead it leads to the formation of the heptazine (C6N7)&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded melem hydrate as the main crystalline phase. Melem hydrate, obtained as single&#8208;crystalline powders, was compared with PTI in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water and in an OLED device. Further, the emergence of each carbon nitride species from its corresponding salt eutectic was rationalized via density functional theory calculations. This study highlights the possibilities to further tailor the properties of eutectic salt melts for ionothermal synthesis of organic functional materials.

         <dc:description>
A hierarchical asymmetric magnetic mesoporous hollow nanorobot was constructed in a sequential interfacial super&#8208;assembly strategy. This nanorobot with magnetic responsiveness, confined catalytic degradation, durable motion and recyclability not only sets a platform for manipulating motion behavior, but also provides a promising tool for future applications.

         <title>Design of Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Phenothiazine Derivatives with Triplet&#8208;Related Dual Emission and High&#8208;Contrast Mechanochromism Guided by Polymorph Prediction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potential conformations of phenthiazine derivatives have been predicted by Polymorph Prediction. The crystals of those derivatives with the potential to form both quasi&#8208;axial and quasi&#8208;equatorial conformations can undergo conformation transition and show high&#8208;contrast mechanochromism from local emission (LE) to intramolecular or intermolecular charge transfer (CT) emission. All the derivatives also exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced emission and triplet&#8208;related dual emission characters. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Xiao, T. Yi, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200458).

         <title>Nanosheets of Ni&#8208;SAPO&#8208;34 Molecular Sieve for Selective Oxidation of Cyclohexanone to Adipic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanosheets of nickel doped SAPO&#8208;34 molecular sieves in thickness of ~10 nm (denoted as NS&#8208;Ni&#8208;SAPO&#8208;34) has been successfully prepared through a morphology&#8208;reserved method of synthesis. A special aluminum phosphate in two&#8208;dimensional layered structure is used as precursor and converts to crystallized SAPO&#8208;34 molecular sieve, in nanosheet morphology reserved from the aluminum phosphate precursor, under hydrothermal conditions with tetraethyl orthosilicate and templates of mixed amines added. It is found that adequate amount of nickel, ~5 wt.%, added to the synthetic system is a key factor for the morphology&#8208;reserved synthesis. By characterization, the nickel is proved to be doped in the framework of the molecular sieve, which more likely helps to balance the high surface energy of nanosheet products. The NS&#8208;Ni&#8208;SAPO&#8208;34 shows excellent catalytic performance for oxidation of cyclohexanone to adipic acid by gaseous oxygen.</dc:description>

         <title>Azobenzene Substituted Triptycenes &#8211; Understanding Exciton Coupling of Molecular Switches in Close Proximity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a series of azobenzene substituted tripycenes. In their design, the switching units were placed in close proximity, but electronically separated by a sp  3  center. The azobenzene switches were prepared  via  Baeyer&#8208;Mills coupling as key step. The isomerization behavior was investigated via  1  H NMR, UV/Vis spectroscopy and HPLC. It was shown that all azobenzene moieties are efficiently switchable. Despite the geometric decoupling of the chromophores, computational studies revealed excitonic coupling effects between the individual azobenzene units depending on the connectivity pattern due to different transition dipole moments of &#960;&#8594;&#960;* excitations. In these cases, transition probabilities for those excitations are slightly altered which is also revealed in their absorption spectra. These insights provide new design parameters for combining multiple photoswitches in one molecule, which bear high potential for energy or information storage systems, and among others also in molecular machines and supramolecular chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>A Stereocontrolled Total Synthesis of Lipoxin B4 and its Biological Activity as a Pro&#8208;Resolving Lipid Mediator of Neuroinflammation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two stereocontrolled, efficient, and modular syntheses of eicosanoid lipoxin B4 (LXB4) are reported. One features a stereoselective reduction followed by an asymmetric epoxidation sequence to set the vicinal diol stereocentres. The dienyne was installed via a one&#8208;pot Wittig olefination and base&#8208;mediated epoxide ring opening cascade. The other approach installed the diol through an asymmetric dihydroxylation reaction followed by a Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons olefination to afford the common dienyne intermediate. Finally, a Sonogashira coupling and an alkyne hydrosilylation/proto&#8208;desilylation protocol furnished LXB4  in 25% overall yield in just 10 steps. For the first time, LXB4  has been fully characterized spectroscopically with its structure confirmed as previously reported. We have demonstrated that the synthesized LXB4  showed similar biological activity to commercial sources in a cellular neuroprotection model. This synthetic route can be employed to synthesize large quantities of LXB4  , enable synthesis of new analogs, and chemical probes for receptor and pathway characterization.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemically Assisted Cycloaddition of Carbon Dioxide to Styrene Oxide on Copper/carbon Hybrid Electrodes: Active Species and Reaction Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel electrochemically assisted cycloaddition reaction process was proposed, in which highly efficient coupling of CO 2 with styrene oxide (SO) can be achieved forming styrene carbonate (SC) as high value&#8208;added product. A series of Cu catalysts with different morphologies and chemical states were fabricated on carbon paper using the in&#8208;situ electrodeposition method, and the sample with nano&#8208;dendrimer structure exhibited relatively high activity of 74.8% SC yield with 92.7% SO conversion under gentle reaction conditions, showing its potential for practical applications. The relatively high electrochemical active surface area and charge transfer ability of dendrimer&#8208;like Cu benefited the electrochemical reaction. Especially the Cu 2+ species those were in&#8208;situ formed during the reaction played a vital role in enhancing the activity and selectivity of the proposed copper/carbon paper (Cu/CP) hybrid catalyst. Cu 2+ served as the active sites, that can not only electrochemically activate CO 2 but also facilitate the ring&#8208;opening process of SO. Mechanistic analysis suggested that the reaction followed the electrochemical and liquid phase heterogeneous paths, respectively, which provided a new green and sustainable route for efficient utilization of CO 2 resources for fine chemical electro&#8208;synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Teaching an old compound new tricks: reversible transamidation in maleamic acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic combinatorial chemistry is a method widely used for generating responsive libraries of compounds, with applications ranging from chemical biology to materials science. It relies on dynamic covalent bonds that are able to form in a reversible manner in mild conditions, and therefore requires the discovery of new types of these bonds in order to progress. Amides, due to their high stability, have been scarcely used in this eld

and typically require an external catalyst or harsh conditions for exchange. Compounds able to undergo uncatalysed transamidation at room temperature are still rare exceptions. In this work, we describe reversible amide formation and transamidation in a class of compounds known as maleamic acids. Due to the presence of a carboxylic acid in b&#8208;position, these compounds are in equilibrium with their anhydride and amine precursors in organic solvents at room temperature. First, we show that this equilibrium is responsive to external stimuli: by alternating the additions of a Br&#248;nsted acid and a base, we can switch between amide and anhydride several times without side&#8208;reactions. Next, we prove that this equilibrium provides a pathway for reversible transamidation without any added catalyst, leading to thermodynamic distributions of amides at room temperature. Lastly, we use dierent preparation conditions and concentrations of Br&#248;nsted acid to access dierent library distributions, easily controlling the transition between kinetic and thermodynamic regimes. Our results show that maleamic acids can undergo transamidation in mild conditions in a reversible and tunable way, establishing them as a new addition to the toolbox of dynamic combinatorial chemistry.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vanadium compounds have been frequently proposed as therapeutics but their application has been hampered due to lack of information on the different V&#8208;containing species that may form and how these interact with blood and cell proteins, and enzymes. Here, we report several resolved crystal structures of lysozyme with bound V  IV  O  2+  and V  IV  OL, where L = 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine or 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (phen), and of trypsin with V  IV  O(picolinato)  2  and V  V  O  2  (phen) moieties. Computational studies complete the refinement and shed light on the relevant role of hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds and microsolvation in the structure stabilization. Noteworthy, the trypsin&#8208;V  V  O  2  (phen) and trypsin&#8208;V  IV  O(OH)(phen) adducts correspond to similar energies suggesting a possible interconversion under physiological/biological conditions. Obtained data support the relevance of hydrolysis of V  IV  &#8208; and V  V  &#8208;complexes in the several types of binding established with proteins and formation of different adducts that may contribute to their pharmacological action, and significantly widens the knowledge of vanadium&#8208;protein interactions  .</dc:description>

         <title>Multienzyme Biocatalytic Cascade Systems in Porous Organic Frameworks for Biosensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New strategies for spatially organizing multienzyme biocatalytic cascades using porous organic frameworks are discussed in this Concept article, describing how this new bio&#8208;nanosystem that integrates framework and enzyme functions can be designed as a versatile biosensing platform.







Abstract
Multienzyme biocatalytic cascade systems (MBCS) have attracted widespread research in the field of biosensing due to selective substrate transformations and signal amplification function. However, the poor stability of enzymes significantly restricts their effectiveness in practical applications. The spatial organization of MBCS within porous organic frameworks (POFs), such as metal&#8211;organic frameworks, covalent organic frameworks, and hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks, is regarded as a promising strategy to overcome these challenges. This advanced biotechnology sets up a POFs microenvironment for enzymes immobilization, and thus make it possible to shield the enzyme from the external stimulus by POFs&#8208;guided structural confinement. Simultaneously, the tailorable porous structure of POFs shell allows for the selective transport of substrates into interior enzymes, thereby accelerating the sensing process. Herein, we present the concept of this POFs&#8208;confined MBCS, wherein enzymes were completely encapsulated into, rather than adsorption onto, the POFs. We highlight the new strategies for MBCS spatial organization through rational POFs support, and describe how this new bio&#8208;nanosystem that integrates framework and enzymes functions can be designed as a versatile biosensing platform. In addition, the challenges and outlooks are also discussed.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Isolation of a Labile Silylated Hydrazinium&#8208;yl Radical Cation, [(Me3Si)2N&#8722;N(H)SiMe3].+</title>

Radical hydrazinium: A highly labile hydrazinium&#8208;yl radical cation, [(Me3Si)2N&#8722;N(H)SiMe3].+, formed by a one&#8208;electron oxidation of tris(trimethylsilyl) hydrazine, (Me3Si)2N&#8722;N(H)SiMe3, with silver salts is presented. The structural and electronic parameters of the hydrazinium&#8208;yl radical cation were elucidated, revealing that the spin density in the isolated radical is mainly localized along the N&#8722;N unit of the hydrazine moiety.







Abstract
The oxidation of silylated hydrazine, (Me3Si)2N&#8722;N(H)SiMe3, with silver salts led to the formation of a highly labile hydrazinium&#8208;yl radical cation, [(Me3Si)2N&#8722;N(H)SiMe3].+, at very low temperatures (decomposition &gt; &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C). EPR, NMR, DFT and Raman studies revealed the formation of a nitrogen&#8208;centered radical cation along the N&#8722;N unit of the hydrazine. In the presence of the weakly coordinating anion [Al{OCH(CF3)2}4]&#8722;, crystallization and structural characterization in the solid state were achieved. The hydrazinium&#8208;yl radical cation has a significantly shortened N&#8722;N bond and a nearly planar N2Si3 framework, in contrast to the starting material. According to DFT calculations, the shortened N&#8722;N bond has a total bond order of 1.5 with a &#960;&#8208;bond order of 0.5. The &#960; bond can be regarded as a three&#8208;&#960;&#8208;electron, two&#8208;center bond.

         <title>Reactivity of Diphenylberyllium as a Br&#248;nsted Base and Its Synthetic Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Br&#248;nsted basic properties of diphenylberyllium have been used to cleanly produce a range of important benchmark compounds. The long&#8208;suspected structure of [Be3(OtBu)6] is finally verified, and shown to be static in solution; the NHC&#8208;stabilised beryllium Grignard is the first of its kind. The stark differences between Be&#8722;N and Be&#8722;P interactions are also evidenced here.







Abstract
Diphenylberyllium [Be3Ph6] is shown here to react cleanly as a Br&#248;nsted base with a vast variety of protic compounds. Through the addition of the simple molecules tBuOH, HNPh2 and HPPh2, as well as the more complex 1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolinium chloride, one or two phenyl groups in diphenylberyllium were protonated. As a result, the long&#8208;postulated structures of [Be3(OtBu)6] and [Be(&#956;&#8208;NPh2)Ph]2 have finally been verified and shown to be static in solution. Additionally [Be(&#956;&#8208;PPh2)(HPPh2)Ph]2 was generated, which is only the second beryllium&#8208;phospanide to be prepared; the stark differences between its behaviour and that of the analogous amide were also examined. The first crystalline example of a beryllium Grignard reagent with a non&#8208;bulky aryl group has also been prepared; it is stabilised with an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene.

         <title>Efficient Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting from a Discrete Hybrid Bismuth Bromide Ferroelectric Templated by Phosphonium Cation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphonium perovskitoid harvesters: A hybrid bismuth halide salt, [Me(Ph)3P]3[Bi2Br9], stabilized by phosphonium cations was synthesized and shown to exhibit ferroelectric polarization as determined by P&#8722;E loop and piezoresponse force microscopy measurements. Flexible composite devices of it with polydimethylsiloxane were fabricated and utilized as piezoelectric nanogenerators with high output voltage and power density values. The obtained voltages were further employed for capacitor charging applications.







Abstract
Bismuth containing hybrid molecular ferroelectrics are receiving tremendous attention in recent years owing to their stable and non&#8208;toxic composition. However, these perovskite&#8208;like structures are primarily limited to ammonium cations. Herein, we report a new phosphonium based discrete perovskite&#8208;like hybrid ferroelectric with a formula [Me(Ph)3P]3[Bi2Br9] (MTPBB) and its mechanical energy harvesting capability. The Polarization&#8208;Electric field (P&#8208;E) measurements resulted in a well&#8208;defined ferroelectric hysteresis loop with a remnant polarization value of 2.1&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Piezoresponse force microscopy experiments enabled visualization of the ferroelectric domain structure and evaluation of the piezoelectric strain coefficient (d33) for an MTPBB single crystal and thin film sample. Furthermore, flexible devices incorporating MTPBB in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix at various concentrations were fabricated and explored for their mechanical energy harvesting properties. The champion device with 20&#8197;wt&#8201;% of MTPBB in PDMS rendered a maximum peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak open&#8208;circuit voltage of 22.9&#8197;V and a maximum power density of 7&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at an optimal load of 4&#8197;M&#937;. Moreover, the potential of MTPBB&#8208;based devices in low power electronics was demonstrated by storing the harvested energy in various electrolytic capacitors.

         <title>Revisiting the environment effect on mass transfer for heterogenized Ru6Pd8 metal&#8208;organic cage photocatalyst confined within 3D matrix</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial light&#8208;driven splitting of water into hydrogen involves multiple links to emulate natural photosynthesis, including light absorption, electron or energy transfer, surface catalysis et al., in which, the mass transportation of sacrificial reagent and reactant is always ignored. Metal&#8208;organic cage (MOC) of Pd  6  Ru  8  (MOC&#8208;16), assembling multiple photosensitive Ru and catalytic Pd concomitant with directional electron transfer between them, provides an opportunity to explore the environmental effects from the view point of mass transportation without disturbance of other links. Zr&#8208;MOF of UiO&#8208;66 is used as a matrix to heterogenize MOC&#8208;16 and a series of characterizations are carried out to unravel the composition, structure and optical properties. The intact MOC&#8208;16 is remained with long&#8208;term photo&#8208;stability and the outstanding photocatalytic activity is obtained by virtue of a long&#8208;lived triplet state. Three matrixes of ZIF&#8208;8, ZIF&#8208;8 derived carbonate CZIF, and UiO&#8208;66 are intercompared for mass transfer based on wettability and porous structure. Water molecule directly takes part in the formation of H  2  catalyzed by MOC&#8208;16@UiO&#8208;66, evidenced by a kinetic isotope effect, in addition to the proton delivery thanks to the hydrophilic nature of UiO&#8208;66. The porous structure of UiO&#8208;66 is essential for the permeation of sacrificial reagent to serve as two&#8208;electron donor, in sharp contrast as one&#8208;electron donor in nonporous CZIF matrix. These results highlight the importance of microenviroment surrounding molecular catalysts in view of the heterogenization of molecular catalysts, meanwhile, provide a prominent guidance on how to choose 3D support to bridge the homogenous and heterogenous system.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequential Nucleophilic Substitution of Phosphorus Trichloride with Alcohols in a Continuous&#8208;Flow Reactor and Consideration of a Mechanism for Reduced Overreaction via the Addition of Imidazole</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrated a sequential nucleophilic substitution of highly electrophilic and inexpensive phosphorus trichloride with three different alcohols in a continuous&#8208;flow reactor. A variety of alcohols including ones that contained acid&#8208;labile and/or basic&#8208;labile functionalities were rapidly reacted. An over nucleophilic substitution that occurred during reaction of the second alcohol was suppressed via the addition of imidazole. Density functional theory calculation of the sequen&#8208;tial nucleophilic substitutions of alcohols was performed both with and without imidazole, and Berry pseudorotation was suggested as a rate&#8208;limiting step in both cases. Herein we discuss the reasons for the decreased selectivity in the ab&#8208;sence of imidazole as well as those for improved selectivity in the presence of imidazole during the second nucleophilic substitution.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of the linker chemistry on the photoinduced charge&#8208;transfer dynamics of heterodinuclear photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For optimizing light&#8208;driven catalytic processes, light&#8208;mediated multi&#8208;electron transfer dynamics in molecular dyads need to be studied and correlated with structural changes focusing on the catalytically active metastable intermediates. Here, spectroelectrochemistry has been employed to investigate the structure dependent photoelectron transfer kinetics in catalytically active intermediates of two Ru&#8208;Rh&#8208;catalysts for light&#8208;driven NAD+ reduction. The excited state reactivity of short&#8208;lived intermediates was studied along different photoreaction pathways by resonance Raman and time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroelectrochemistry with sub&#8208;ps time resolution under in operando conditions. The results demonstrate for the first time, how the bridging ligand serves as an (multi&#8208;)electron storage structure, mediates the strength of the electronic coupling of catalytic and photocenter and impacts the targeted electron transfer as well as parasitic electron&#8208;transfer kinetics.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report the first example of very efficient NIR Circularly Polarized Luminescence (CPL) (around 970 nm) in water, obtained thanks to the combined use of a chiral Yb complex and of poly lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles. [Yb  L  (tta)  2  ]CH  3  COO (  L  = N, N&#8217;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;pyridylmethylidene)&#8208;1,2&#8208;(  R,R  +  S,S  ) cyclohexanediamine and tta = 2&#8208;thenoyltrifluoroacetonate) shows good CPL in organic solvents, because the tta ligands efficiently sensitize Yb NIR luminescence and the readily prepared chiral ligand  L  endows the complex with the necessary dissymmetry. PLGA nanoparticles incorporate the complex and protect the metal ion from the intrusion of solvent molecules, while ensuring biocompatibility, water solubility and stability to the complex. Hydrophilic NIR&#8208;CPL optical probes can find applications in the field of NIR&#8208;CPL bio&#8208;assays.</dc:description>

         <title>The effects of ring strain on cyclic tetraaryl[5]cumulenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic tetraaryl[5]cumulenes (  1a&#8211;f  ) have been synthesized and studied as a function of increasing ring strain. The magnitude of ring strain is approximated by the extent of bending of the cumulenic core as assessed by a combination of X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and DFT calculations. Trends are observed in  13  C NMR, UV&#8208;vis, and Raman spectra associated with ring strain, but the effects are small. In particular, the experimental HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap is not appreciably affected by bending of the [5]cumulene framework from ca. 174&#176; (  &#955;  max  = 504 nm) in  1a  to ca. 178&#176; (  &#955;  max  = 494 nm) in  1f  .</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Star&#8208;Shaped Indoline Hole Transport Materials: The Influence of Planarity on the Hole Extraction and Transport Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The planarity of the side chain of star&#8208;shaped hole transport material (HTM) is systematically improved. Along with the improvement, the HOMO level of the HTM is increased, leading to enhanced hole extraction capability. Meanwhile, the hole transport capability can also be improved due to the intensification of molecular stacking during film formation. As a result, the planar HTM achieves a relatively high efficiency of 18.48&#8201;%, providing us with a promising strategy for further optimization of efficient HTMs.







Abstract
As the key properties of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the hole extraction and transport capabilities of the hole transport material (HTM) affect the photovoltaic performance of PSCs to a considerable extent, while both capabilities can be adjusted by molecular planarity. Therefore, in this work, the molecular planarity of the HTM is systematically optimized to regulate the hole extraction and transport capabilities. Along with the improvement in planarity, the HTM&#8242;s HOMO level is increased, leading to the enhancement of hole extraction capability. Meanwhile, the hole transport capability can also be improved due to the intensification of molecular stacking during the film formation. As a result, the planar HTM achieves a relatively high efficiency of 18.48&#8201;%, which is higher than that of spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. Accordingly, the molecular planarity presents an important impact on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, providing us with a promising strategy for further optimization of efficient HTMs.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of folded aromatic oligoamides with absolute control of helical sense has been synthesized. These helices can implement an asymmetric reduction reaction in their cavities, and the diastereoselectivity of the reaction is significantly improved by optimization of the oligoamide sequences. More information can be found in the Research Article by Q. Gan and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200834).

 Dimers in a Low&#8208;Dimensional Tetrabromocuprate Magnet</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Only one way: (3,4&#8208;lutH)2CuBr4 (3,4&#8208;lut=3,4&#8208;lutidine) is a homometallic spin&#8208;
 tetrabromocuprate that adopts a bilayer structure with strong antiferromagnetic coupling between dimers across the bilayer and weaker intralayer ferromagnetic interactions. First&#8208;principles calculations suggest there is only significant magnetic coupling within one direction of a layer; this is consistent with a spin&#8208;ladder motif with antiferromagnetic rung and weaker ferromagnetic rail couplings.







Abstract
This work describes a homometallic spin&#8208;
 tetrabromocuprate adopting a bilayer structure. Magnetic&#8208;susceptibility measurements show a broad maximum centred near 70&#8197;K, with fits to this data using a Heisenberg model consistent with strong antiferromagnetic coupling between neighbouring copper atoms in different layers of the bilayer. There are further weak intralayer ferromagnetic interactions between copper cations in neighbouring dimers. First&#8208;principles calculations are consistent with this, but suggest there is only significant magnetic coupling within one direction of a layer; this would suggest the presence of a spin ladder within the bilayer with antiferromagnetic rung and weaker ferromagnetic rail couplings.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes Carrying Weakly Coordinating Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piggyback: N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes carrying weakly coordinating anions (WCA&#8208;NHCs) are an important and versatile ligand class used in transition metal as well as main group element chemistry. Bearing a negative charge in the backbone of the heterocycle, these carbenes can convert otherwise cationic NHC complexes into their overall neutral congeners. Aspects such as their development, syntheses, reactivity and possible future applications are discussed within this concept article.







Abstract
In this Concept article we provide a brief overview of the design and preparation of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes carrying weakly coordinating anions (WCA&#8208;NHCs). The anionic charge in these ligand systems is located on an exocyclic group, for example, B(C6F5)3, tethered to the backbone of the imidazole ring, thus resembling a weakly coordinating moiety. With the general guiding principle behind the application of WCA&#8208;NHCs being the conversion of otherwise cationic NHC complexes into their overall neutral congeners, numerous transition metal as well as main group element complexes were isolated during the last decade, which are summarized herein.

Creating Kekul&#233; diradicaloids: That cyclic(alkyl)(amino)(carbene)&#8212;CAAC&#8212;donates one electron during the formation of a transient radical&#8208;cation was evidenced by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The disclosed property of CAAC as a one&#8208;electron reductant was utilized for the synthesis of acyclic(amino)(aryl)carbene&#8208;based Chichibabin hydrocarbons, a new class of Kekul&#233; diradicaloids.

         <title>Irreversible Inhibition of IspG, a Target for the Development of New Antimicrobials, by a 2&#8208;Vinyl Analogue of its MEcPP Substrate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rational design of a substrate analogue has afforded the first irreversible inhibitor of an IspG enzyme, a target for the development of new drugs to fight antimicrobial resistance. Inspired by the structural features of the natural substrate and by mechanistic aspects, we introduced a vinyl substituent to generate conjugated species during enzyme catalysis. Inhibition might occur through covalent interaction at the catalytic site. More information can be found in the Research Article by J.&#8208;B. Behr, M. Seemann, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200241).

         <title>Significant Effect of Flexibility of Bridging Alkyl Chains on&#160;the&#160;Proximity of Stacked Porphyrin and Phthalocyanine Conjugated with Fourfold Rotaxane Linkage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The spatial distance is an important factor in controlling the functional interactions between molecular units in a conjugate; therefore, the bridging unit was closely examined.&#160; Herein, we examined the effect of the flexibility of bridging alkyl chains &#160;on the proximity of stacked porphyrin and phthalocyanine conjugated with a fourfold rotaxane linkage. We found that closely stacking two&#160; &#960; &#160;systems&#160;requires bridging alkyl chains above&#160;a certain length, and the shorter bridges hinder stacking because of their lower flexibility. The stacking distance between porphyrin and phthalocyanine in the conjugate with decyl (C10) chains was estimated to be 4.03 &#197; and showed&#160;a unique physical character&#160;arising from short&#8208;distance interactions. The&#160;longer alkyl chains minimized steric restriction inside the fourfold rotaxane and allowed efficient communication between the porphyrin and phthalocyanine units. This is due to the flexibility of the side chains.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Participation of Solvent Molecules in the Formation of Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This article reports supramolecular polymerization of two naphthalene&#8208;diimide (NDI) building blocks (NDI&#8208;L and NDI&#8208;C) in&#160;n&#8208;heptane (Hep) and methylcyclohexane (MCH). NDI&#8208;L and NDI&#8208;C differ only by the peripheral hydrocarbon wedges, consisting of linear C7 chains or cyclic methylcyclohexane rings, respectively. UV/Vis and FT&#8208;IR spectra&#160;reveal distinct internal&#8208;order and H&#8208;bonding&#160; for NDI&#8208;L and NDI&#8208;C aggregates irrespective of the solvent, indicating a dominant role of the intrinsic packing parameters of the individual building block. However, NDI&#8208;L produces a significantly stronger gel in Hep compared to MCH. In contrast, NDI&#8208;C exhibits a clear preference for MCH, producing gel with moderate strength but in Hep it fails to produce 1D morphology or gel. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies corroborate with the experimental results and provide a quantitative estimate regarding the thermodynamics of self&#8208;assembly in these four combinations. Such clear&#8208;cut shape&#8208;matching effect (between the peripheral hydrocarbon wedge and the solvent system) unambiguously support a direct participation of the solvent molecules during supramolecular polymerization and presence of a closely&#8208;adhered solvent shell around the supramolecular polymers, similar to the first layer of water molecules around the protein surface. Solvent induced CD experiments support this hypothesis as induced CD band was observed only from a chiral co&#8208;solvent of matching shape. This is reconfirmed by the higher de&#8208;solvation temperature of the shape&#8208;matching NDI/solvent system combination compared to the shape mis&#8208;match combination in variable temperature UV/Vis experiments, revealing transformation to a different aggregate at higher temperatures rather than disassembly to the monomer for all four combinations.</dc:description>

         <title>Breaking the Aliphatic Wall: Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Reductive Amination of Ketones and Secondary Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct reductive amination (DRA) is a ubiquitous reaction in organic chemistry. This transformation between a carbonyl group and an amine is most often achieved using super stoichiometric amount of hazardous hydride reagents, thus being incompatible with many sensitive functional groups. DRA could also be achieved by means of chemo&#8208; or bio&#8208;catalysis, thereby attracting the interest of industry as well as academic laboratories due to their virtually perfect atomeconomy. Although DRA are well&#8208;established for substrate pairs such as aldehydes with either 1 o or 2 o amines as well as ketones with 1 o amines, the current methodologies are limited in the case of ketones with 2 o amines. Herein, we present a general DRA protocol that overcomes this major limitation by means of iridium catalysis. The applicability of the methodology is demonstrated by accessing an unprecedented range of biologically relevant tertiary amines starting from both aliphatic ketones and aliphatic amines. The choice of a disphosphane ligand (Josiphos A or Xantphos) is essential for the success of the transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>A Series of Rare&#8208;Earth Mesoionic Carbene Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis and characterisation of a series of rare&#8208;earth mesoionic carbene complexes, [RE{N(SiMe  3  )  2  }  3  {CN(Me)C(Me)N(Me)CH}] (  3RE  , RE = Sc, Ce, Pr, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, and Lu), greatly expanding the limited library of f&#8208;block mesoionic carbene complexes. These complexes were prepared by treatment of the parent RE&#8208;triamides with an N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin (NHO), where an NHO backbone proton undergoes a formal 1,4&#8208;proton migration to the NHO&#8208;methylene group. For all RE(III) metals, as expected, quantum chemical calculations suggest only a&#160; &#963; &#8208; component to the metal&#8208;carbene bonding, in contrast to a previously reported uranium(III) congener where the 5f  3  &#160;metal engages in a weak&#160; &#960; &#8208;back&#8208;bond to the MIC. All complexes were characterized by static variable&#8208;temperature magnetic measurements, and dynamic magnetic measurements reveal that&#160;  3Dy  &#160;and&#160;  3Er  &#160;are field&#8208;induced single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs), with&#160; U  eff  &#160;energy barriers of 35 and 128 K, respectively. Complex&#160;  3Dy  &#160;is, as expected, a poorly performing SMM, but conversely&#160;  3Er  &#160;performs unexpectedly well.</dc:description>

         <title>Strong Antibiotic Activity of the Myxocoumarin Scaffold in vitro and in vivo</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Myxocoumarin B from Stigmatella aurantiaca MYX&#8208;030 is shown to possess strong antibiotic activity against a range of clinically relevant pathogens. Synthesis of a diverse compound library of structural analogs enabled investigations into initial structure&#8208;activity relationships and revealed the potential of the myxocoumarin scaffold as lead structure for the development of new antibiotics. Myxocoumarin B and analogs show low toxicity in&#8197;vivo in a zebrafish infection model and were superior in clearing bacterial infections when compared to established antibiotics such as vancomycin.







Abstract
The increasing emergence of resistances against established antibiotics is a substantial threat to human health. The discovery of new compounds with potent antibiotic activity is thus of utmost importance. Within this work, we identify strong antibiotic activity of the natural product myxocoumarin B from Stigmatella aurantiaca MYX&#8208;030 against a range of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens, including clinical isolates of MRSA. A focused library of structural analogs was synthesized to explore initial structure&#8208;activity relationships and to identify equipotent myxocoumarin derivatives devoid of the natural nitro substituent to significantly streamline synthetic access. The cytotoxicity of the myxocoumarins as well as their potential to cure bacterial infections in vivo was established using a zebrafish model system. Our results reveal the exceptional antibiotic activity of the myxocoumarin scaffold and hence its potential for the development of novel antibiotics.

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution over Ce&#8722;Co9S8 Core&#8211;Shell Nanoneedle Arrays by Electronic and Architectural Dual Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rare&#8208;earth&#8208;based nanomaterials for catalysis: Ce&#8208;doped Co9S8 core&#8211;shell nanoneedle arrays, vertically aligned on carbon cloth (Ce&#8722;Co9S8@CC) were prepared in&#8197;situ by calcining a Ce&#8722;Co(CO3)0.5OH@CC precursor. The Ce&#8208;incorporated Co9S8 active component and core&#8211;shell nanoneedle arrayed architecture give Ce&#8722;Co9S8@CC a refigured electronic configuration, highly exposed active sites and multidimensional mass diffusion channels. Benefitting from these dual electronic and architectural advantages, Ce&#8722;Co9S8@CC exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity, stability and selectivity toward the oxygen evolution reaction.







Abstract
An dual electronic and architectural engineering strategy is a good way to rationally design earth&#8208;abundant and highly efficient electrocatalysts of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for sustainable hydrogen&#8208;based energy devices. Here, a Ce&#8208;doped Co9S8 core&#8211;shell nanoneedle array (Ce&#8722;Co9S8@CC) supported on a carbon cloth has been designed and developed to accelerate the sluggish kinetics of the OER. Profiting from valance alternative Ce doping, a fine core&#8211;shell structure and vertically aligned nanoneedle arrayed architecture, Ce&#8722;Co9S8@CC integrates modulated electronic structure, highly exposed active sites, and multidimensional mass diffusion channels; together, these afford a favorable catalyzed OER. Ce&#8722;Co9S8@CC exhibits remarkable performance in the OER in an alkaline medium, where the overpotential requires only 242&#8197;mV to deliver a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for the OER; this is 70&#8197;mV superior to that of Ce&#8208;free Co9S8 catalyst and other counterparts. Good stability and impressive selectivity (nearly 100&#8201;% Faradic efficiency) are also demonstrated. When integrated into a two&#8208;electrode OER//HER electrolyzer, the as&#8208;prepared Ce&#8722;Co9S8@CC displays a low operation potential of 1.54&#8197;V at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and long&#8208;term stability, thus demonstrating great potential for economical water electrolysis.

         <title>Cobalt Complexes Supported by Phosphinoquinoline Ligands for the Catalyzed Hydrosilylation of Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphinoquinoline cobalt(II) complexes were used for the hydrosilylation of ketones. The diisopropylphosphino containing bisliganded complex was the most efficient allowing the transformation of variously substituted aliphatic or aromatic ketones at low catalyst loading and under mild conditions. The involvement of a Co&#8722;H complex as the active species was experimentally ascertained.







Abstract
P,N phosphinoquinoline based ligands differing by the nature of the phosphorus substituent (iPr, Ph) were employed to synthesize a series of cobalt(II) complexes ([LCoBr2], [L2CoBr](PF6) and [L&#8217;2CoBr](PF6)). The latter were obtained in high yield and characterized among others by X&#8208;ray analysis and elemental analysis. Complex [L2CoBr](PF6) showed a very good catalytic activity for the hydrosilylation of various ketones. The catalysis proceeds at a low catalytic loading (1&#8197;mol&#8201;%) with only 1 equivalent of Ph2SiH2 in mild conditions and was efficient with aliphatic or aromatic ketones giving moderate to excellent yields of the corresponding silylated ether.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bigger the better! Thioamides and selenoamides are better hydrogen&#8208;bond donors than carboxamides because their amino groups are more positively charged. Quantum chemical analyses reveal that this counterintuitive phenomenon, which is not explainable by the electronegativity, results from the effective steric size of the chalcogen atoms.







Abstract
The amino groups of thio&#8208; and selenoamides can act as stronger hydrogen&#8208;bond donors than of carboxamides, despite the lower electronegativity of S and Se. This phenomenon has been experimentally explored, particularly in organocatalysis, but a sound electronic explanation is lacking. Our quantum chemical investigations show that the NH2 groups in thio&#8208; and selenoamides are more positively charged than in carboxamides. This originates from the larger electronic density flow from the nitrogen lone pair of the NH2 group towards the lower&#8208;lying &#960;*C=S and &#960;*C=Se orbitals than to the high&#8208;lying &#960;*C=O orbital. The relative energies of the &#960;* orbitals result from the overlap between the chalcogen np and carbon 2p atomic orbitals, which is set by the carbon&#8208;chalcogen equilibrium distance, a consequence of the Pauli repulsion between the two bonded atoms. Thus, neither the electronegativity nor the often&#8208;suggested polarizability but the steric size of the chalcogen atom determines the amide's hydrogen&#8208;bond donor capability.

         <title>First&#8208;Principles Design of Na&#8208;ion Superionic Conductors: Interstitial&#8208;Based Na Diffusion in NaCuZrS3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes are usually based on vacancies of diffusing ions to enhance diffusivity. NaCuZrS3 with a post&#8208;perovskite&#8208;like structure exhibits an interstitial&#8208;based Na ion diffusion mechanism. The low diffusion barriers of the order of 0.22&#8197;eV in the two &#8208; dimensional interlayer channels suggest a new class of Na&#8208;ion superionic conductors for further exploration. Doping by trivalent ions (such as La) on Zr sites could help introduce Na interstitials.







Abstract
In recent years all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SS&#8208;SIBs) have drawn significant attention due to their potential to be safer and lower cost than lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the lack of sodium solid&#8208;state electrolytes with high ionic conductivity has become one of the major challenges. Here, with first&#8208;principles computation we took NaCuZrS3, consisting of earth&#8208;abundant and environmentally benign elements only, as an example to study Na&#8208;ion transport in the post&#8208;perovskite&#8208;like structure and used computation&#8208;guided design to improve its potential as a solid&#8208;state electrolyte. With ab initio molecular dynamics simulation and nudged elastic band calculation, we studied possible diffusion mechanisms in this material and found that Na ion interstitials have a favorable migration barrier of 0.22&#8197;eV, which is among the smallest in the literature reported values. Considering the large formation energy of Frenkel defects, we proposed doping strategy to introduce extra Na interstitials in the material. Our study suggests that the post&#8208;perovskite&#8208;like sulfides are worth of exploration for applications in SS&#8208;SIBs.

         <title>Design of Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Phenothiazine Derivatives with Triplet&#8208;Related Dual Emission and High&#8208;Contrast Mechanochromism Guided by Polymorph Prediction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potential conformations of phenothiazine derivatives were well predicted by Polymorph Prediction. The crystals of those derivatives with the potential to form both quasi&#8208;axial (ax) and quasi&#8208;equatorial (eq) conformations could undergo conformation transition and showed high&#8208;contrast mechanochromism (MC). All the derivatives exhibited aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) and triplet&#8208;related dual emission (DEM) characters.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;contrast stimulus&#8208;responsive materials with excited triplet emission is of great significance for anti&#8208;counterfeiting, sensor and memory applications, but remains a challenge. Here, we report a strategy for the rational design of stimulus&#8208;responsive phenothiazine derivatives with triplet&#8208;related dual emissions and high&#8208;contrast mechanochromism guided by Polymorph Prediction. The designed phenothiazine derivatives have the characters of simple structures, a facile synthetic procedure, and a good crystalline nature. We found that the crystals of those derivatives with the potential to form both quasi&#8208;axial (ax) and quasi&#8208;equatorial (eq) conformations could undergo conformation transition and show significant emission difference (&#916;&#955;em&gt;100&#8197;nm) under mechanical force. Meanwhile, all these phenothiazine derivatives exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced emission and emit room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence or thermally activated delayed fluorescence. The significant luminescent change of these materials under different stimuli gives them promise for applications in encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Acenaphthenoannulation Induced by the Dual Lewis Acidity of Alumina</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual Lewis acidity of &#947;&#8208;alumina is reported to enable rapid &#960;&#8208;extension of readily available building blocks through the tandem activation of &#8220;soft&#8221; triple C&#8722;C bonds and hard C&#8722;F bonds. The reaction gives facile access to elusive non&#8208;alternant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as &#960;&#8208;extended helicenes and geodesic carbon nanoribbon fragments.







Abstract
We have discovered a dual (i.&#8201;e., soft and hard) Lewis acidity of alumina that enables rapid one&#8208;pot &#960;&#8208;extension through the activation of terminal alkynes followed by C&#8722;F activation. The tandem reaction introduces an acenaphthene fragment &#8211; an essential moiety of geodesic polyarenes. This reaction provides quick access to elusive non&#8208;alternant polyarenes such as &#960;&#8208;extended buckybowls and helicenes through three&#8208;point annulation of the 1&#8208;(2&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;6&#8208;fluorophenyl)naphthalene moiety. The versatility of the developed method was demonstrated by the synthesis of unprecedented structural fragments of elusive geodesic graphene nanoribbons.

The G&#228;nseliesel showcases the scientific magic in G&#246;ttingen! Scientific magic on the &#945;&#8208;anomer of d&#8208;glucosamine helps the targeted cleavage of C&#8722;N bonds in d&#8208;glucosamine (&#945;&#8208;2&#176; amine) from biobased resources and the conjunction of nitrogen in the synthesis of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines. This new approach expands the scope of readily accessible imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines relative to existing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods. A key strategic advantage of this approach is that the &#945;&#8208;anomer of d&#8208;glucosamine enables C&#8722;N bond cleavage through a seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring transition state.

         <title>Deposition of Vertically Aligned Ag/Ag2S Nanoflakes on EGaIn Particles for Humidity Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Core&#8211;shell EGaIn/Ag particles were prepared in an ultrasonication assisted galvanic replacement reaction, and were subsequently transformed into EGaIn/Ag/Ag2S by a partial sulfurization. A humidity sensor based on the EGaIn/Ag/Ag2S particles showed superior sensing response to EGaIn and EGaIn/Ag due to the silver sulfide in the composites; two conduction mechanisms take place simultaneously.







Abstract
Liquid metals, which possess both good electrical conductivity and liquid&#8208;like processability, have drawn much attention recently. They are also capable of acting as synthesis templates to guide the deposition of other functional materials. Herein, through an in&#8208;situ galvanic replacement reaction assisted by ultrasonication, core&#8211;shell EGaIn/Ag particles composed of EGaIn cores and vertically aligned Ag nanoflakes as shells were prepared; they were further sulfurized to yield ternary EGaIn/Ag/Ag2S core&#8211;shell composite particles. A humidity sensor based on EGaIn/Ag/Ag2S particles showed much higher sensing response than EGaIn and EGaIn/Ag. Such superior performance could be attributed to the n&#8208;type semiconducting character of Ag2S allowing it to receive electrons from water molecules at low humidity, and its highly hydrophilic surface allowing it to absorb more water molecules at higher humidity so as to enable the formation of ion&#8208;conductive paths.

         <title>pH&#8208;Triggered Removal of Nitrogenous Organic Micropollutants from Water by Using Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra</title>

MOPping up micropollutants: A new pH&#8208;triggered pollutant&#8208;removal methodology that uses water&#8208;soluble metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOPs) as coordinative capturing agents removes nitrogenous organic micropollutants from water. The exohedral coordination positions in the MOP structure are harnessed to coordinatively sequester the coordinating pollutants, while the exposed surface carboxyl groups are used to control their solubility in water through acid/base reactions. Benzotriazole (BT), benzothiazole (BTZ), 1&#8208;napthylamine (NA) and isoquinoline (IQ) were selected to validate this methodology.







Abstract
Water pollution threatens human and environmental health worldwide. Thus, there is a pressing need for new approaches to water purification. Herein, we report a novel supramolecular strategy based on the use of a metal&#8208;organic polyhedron (MOP) as a capture agent to remove nitrogenous organic micropollutants from water, even at very low concentrations (ppm), based exclusively on coordination chemistry at the external surface of the MOP. Specifically, we exploit the exohedral coordination positions of RhII&#8208;MOP to coordinatively sequester pollutants bearing N&#8208;donor atoms in aqueous solution, and then harness their exposed surface carboxyl groups to control their aqueous solubility through acid/base reactions. We validated this approach for removal of benzotriazole, benzothiazole, isoquinoline, and 1&#8208;napthylamine from water.

         <title>Hierarchical Fibrous Honeycomb Ceramics with High Load Capability and Low Light&#8208;Off Temperature for the Next&#8208;Generation Auto Emissions Standards</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new 3D microarchitecture as a backbone to support the catalyst was prepared by combing with the synergy of high&#8208;strength ceramic fibers and ultrathin TiO2 nanosheets. The honeycomb ceramic exhibits a high volume&#8208;specific surface area of 3.59&#215;104&#8197;cm2/cm3, a compressive strength of 2.01&#8197;MPa. It also delivered a low light&#8208;off temperature of 150&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Novel and stringent automotive exhaust gas emissions standards are urgently needed to counter the problems posed by the worsening global climate and environment. However, the traditional cordierite&#8208;based honeycomb ceramics substrates with ultimate pore density have seriously restricted the establishment of new emission standards. Herein, we introduce a novel robust substrate with tailored volume&#8208;specific surface area and low heat capacity. This substrate employs the synergy of high&#8208;strength ceramic fibers and ultrathin TiO2 nanosheets. The micro&#8208;sized fibers provide support to ensure structural strength during the catalytic reaction, while the nanosheets play the dual role of connecting the fibers and providing a high surface area for catalyst immobilization. The new three&#8208;dimensional (3D) microarchitecture exhibits a high volume&#8208;specific surface area of 3.59&#215;104&#8197;cm2/cm3, a compressive strength of 2.01&#8197;MPa, and remarkable stability after high&#8208;speed air erosion at 800&#8201;&#176;C. The honeycomb&#8208;like structure exhibit low resistance to gas flow. Furthermore, after loading with Pt and Pd nanoparticles, the composite 3D microarchitecture delivered an excellent catalytic performance and prominent structural stability, with a super low light&#8208;off temperature of 150&#8201;&#176;C. The outstanding mechanical and thermal stability and the high surface area and light&#8208;off temperature of the new substrate indicate its potential for use as a highly efficient catalytic carrier to meet the next&#8208;generation auto emissions standards.

         <title>A Mesoionic Diselenolene Anion and the Corresponding Radical Dianion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Being mesoionic makes the difference: A diselenolene ligand with fundamentally different electronic properties compared to a normal diselenolene is reported. Two stable redox states are accessible: a paramagnetic radical dianion and a diamagnetic monoanion. The ligand was used for the preparation of novel aluminum bis&#8208; and tris(diselenolene) complexes.







Abstract
Dichalcogenolenes are archetypal redox non&#8208;innocent ligands with numerous applications. Herein, a diselenolene ligand with fundamentally different electronic properties is described. A mesoionic diselenolene was prepared by selenation of a C2&#8208;protected imidazolium salt. This ligand is diamagnetic, which is in contrast to the paramagnetic nature of standard dichalcogenolene monoanions. The new ligand is also redox&#8208;active, as demonstrated by isolation of a stable diselenolene radical dianion. The unique electronic properties of the new ligand give rise to unusual coordination chemistry. Thus, preparation of a hexacoordinate aluminum tris(diselenolene) complex and a Lewis acidic aluminate complex with two ligand&#8208;centered unpaired electrons was achieved.

         <title>Constructing Atomic Fe and N Co&#8208;doped Hollow Carbon Nanospheres with a Polymer Encapsulation Strategy for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries with Accelerated Polysulfide Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymer encapsulation strategy is designed to synthesize atomic Fe and N co&#8208;doped hollow carbon nanospheres (Fe&#8722;NHC) with Fe&#8722;Nx sites for modifying commercial PP separator of LSBs to suppress the shuttle effect and promote the sluggish kinetics of intermediate polysulfides. Therefore, the battery with the Fe&#8722;NHC/PP separator delivers outstanding cycling and rate performances. Even at a harsh current density of 4&#8197;C, a high capacity of 824&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 is achieved, indicating the superiority of the Fe&#8208;NHC/PP separator in LSBs.







Abstract
As competitive next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries, lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs) suffer from the shuttle effect and the sluggish kinetics of intermediate polysulfides during charge and discharge processes, adversely affecting their electrochemical performances and actual applications. Herein, we demonstrate a polymer encapsulation strategy to synthesize atomic Fe and N co&#8208;doped hollow carbon nanospheres (Fe&#8722;NHC) with Fe&#8722;Nx sites for modifying commercial PP separator of LSBs to suppress the shuttle effect and promote the kinetics of intermediate polysulfides. Benefiting from the excellent structural design, the doped&#8208;N with positive charges could effectively adsorb negatively charged soluble polysulfides, help attract the soluble polysulfides to the Fe atoms and boost the catalytic transformation of the soluble polysulfides. Additionally, such a thin carbon shell could provide a short mass diffusion pathway and hence promote the adsorption and the catalytic conversion.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A polymer encapsulation strategy&lt;/b&gt; is designed to synthesize atomic Fe and N co-doped hollow carbon nanospheres (Fe&#8722;NHC) with Fe&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; sites for modifying commercial PP separator of LSBs to suppress the shuttle effect and promote the sluggish kinetics of intermediate polysulfides. Therefore, the battery with the Fe&#8722;NHC/PP separator delivers outstanding cycling and rate performances. Even at a harsh current density of 4&#8197;C, a high capacity of 824&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; is achieved, indicating the superiority of the Fe-NHC/PP separator in LSBs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As competitive next-generation rechargeable batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) suffer from the shuttle effect and the sluggish kinetics of intermediate polysulfides during charge and discharge processes, adversely affecting their electrochemical performances and actual applications. Herein, we demonstrate a polymer encapsulation strategy to synthesize atomic Fe and N co-doped hollow carbon nanospheres (Fe&#8722;NHC) with Fe&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; sites for modifying commercial PP separator of LSBs to suppress the shuttle effect and promote the kinetics of intermediate polysulfides. Benefiting from the excellent structural design, the doped-N with positive charges could effectively adsorb negatively charged soluble polysulfides, help attract the soluble polysulfides to the Fe atoms and boost the catalytic transformation of the soluble polysulfides. Additionally, such a thin carbon shell could provide a short mass diffusion pathway and hence promote the adsorption and the catalytic conversion. Therefore, the battery with the Fe&#8722;NHC/PP separator delivers outstanding cycling and rate performances. At the large current density of 1&#8197;C, the specific capacity is 1079&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and maintains a low loss of 0.076&#8201;% per cycle within 500&#8197;cycles. Even at a harsh current density of 4&#8197;C, a high capacity of 824&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; is still achieved, indicating the advantage of the Fe&#8722;NHC/PP separator in LSBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Halogenation of the Hexaphosphabenzene Complex [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;6:&#951;6&#8208;P6)]: Snapshots on the Reaction Progress</title>

         <dc:description>
Snapshots on the halogenation of the hexaphosphabenzene complex [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;6:&#951;6&#8208;P6)] show the plethora of complexes that are formed, resulting from the initial halogenation of the P6 ligand. Among them, with iodine, a compound with six P atoms still present could be obtained, directly at room temperature. With the more aggressive bromine and chlorine, the P6 unit degrades to an allylic P3 unit but phosphorus rich compounds could also be isolated.







Abstract
The oxidation of [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;6:&#951;6&#8208;P6)] (1) with halogens or halogen sources was investigated. The iodination afforded the ionic complexes [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;3:&#951;3&#8208;P3)(&#956;,&#951;1:&#951;1:&#951;1:&#951;1&#8208;P3I3)][X] (X=I3&#8722;, I&#8722;) (2) and [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;4:&#951;4&#8208;P4)(&#956;&#8208;PI2)][I3] (3), while the reaction with PBr5 led to the complexes [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;3:&#951;3&#8208;P3)(&#956;&#8208;Br)2][Cp*MoBr4] (4) [(Cp*MoBr)2(&#956;,&#951;3:&#951;3&#8208;P3)(&#956;,&#951;1&#8208;P2Br3)] (5) and [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;&#8208;PBr2)(&#956;&#8208;PHBr)(&#956;&#8208;Br)2] (6). The reaction of 1 with the far stronger oxidizing agent PCl5 was followed via time&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent 31P{1H} NMR spectroscopy. One of the first intermediates detected at 193&#8197;K was [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;3:&#951;3&#8208;P3)(&#956;&#8208;PCl2)2][PCl6] (8) which rearranges upon warming to [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;&#8208;PCl2)2(&#956;&#8208;Cl)2] (9), [(Cp*MoCl)2(&#956;,&#951;3:&#951;3&#8208;P3)(&#956;&#8208;PCl2)] (10) and [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;4:&#951;4&#8208;P4)(&#956;&#8208;PCl2)][Cp*MoCl4] (11), which could be isolated at room temperature. All complexes were characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, NMR spectroscopy and their electronic structures were elucidated by DFT calculations.
