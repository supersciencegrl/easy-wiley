         <title>Conformation Regulation of Trisresorcinarene Directed by Cavity Solvation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This compound is a synthetic macrocycle comprising three pivaloyl&#8208;protected resorcinarene units connected by six pentylene chains. We conducted a conformational study using 1H&#8208;NMR, X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), and computational analyses. The macrocycle adopts two conformers, one open, the other closed. The ratio of the open to closed forms depended on the solvent used. Only the open form existed in [D8]toluene, both forms coexisted in [D6]benzene, and the closed form was the major conformer in [D1]chloroform. The benzene&#8208;solvated open form observed in the solid state suggests that cavity solvation by solvent molecules directs the open form. The open form was the major or only conformer in [D10]o&#8208; and [D10]m&#8208;xylene and [D12]mesitylene, whereas the closed form was the major conformer in [D6]acetone. The open and closed forms were equally populated in [D10]p&#8208;xylene, suggesting that the size, shape, and dimensions of the solvent molecules most likely influenced the conformation of the protected trisresocinarene.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering the cell surface sugar&#8208;coating via Biochemical Pathways</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cell surface components, specifically glycans, play a significant role in several biological functions like cell structure, crosstalk between cells, and eventual target recognition of the cells for therapeutics. The dense layer of glycans, i.e., glycocalyx, could differ in taxon, species, and cell type. Glycans are coupled with lipids and proteins to form glycolipids, glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol&#8208;anchored proteins, making their study challenging. However, understanding glycosylation at the cellular level is vital for fundamental research and the advancement of glycan&#8208;targeted therapy. Among different pathways, metabolic glycan labelling uses the natural metabolic processes of the cell to introduce abiotic functionality into glycan residues. The Bertozzi group pioneered metabolic oligosaccharide engineering using glycan salvage pathways to convert monosaccharides with unnatural modifications. This eventually results in the probe becoming part of the complex cellular glycan structures via click chemistry using copper. On the other hand, the boronic acid&#8208;based probe can recognise carbohydrates in a single step without any chemical modification of the surface. This review discusses the significance of glycans as biomarkers for different diseases and the necessity to evaluate them in situ within the physiological environment. The review also discusses the prospect of this field and its potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Generation of Benzyl Anions from Aryl Ketones Utilizing [1,2]&#8208;Phospha&#8208;Brook Rearrangement and Their Application to Synthesis of Tertiary Benzylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A synthetic method of tertiary alcohols was developed based on the formal umpolung addition of aryl ketones with electrophiles utilizing the [1,2]&#8208;phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement under Br&#248;nsted base catalysis. The addition reaction of &#945;&#8208;hydroxyphosphonates, derived from alkyl aryl&#8208; and diaryl ketones, with electrophiles such as phenyl vinyl sulfone, afforded phosphates having a tertiary alkyl group, which were readily convertible to the corresponding tertiary benzylic alcohols. This operationally simple protocol provides efficient complementary access to tertiary alcohols that are difficult to synthesize by conventional methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Formate Salt as a Bifunctional Reagent for Hydroxylation and Carbonylation Reactions Under Photochemically Driven Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we disclose for the first time that formate salt can be used as a bifunctional reagent for the synthesis of phenol derivatives and as a CO source for carbonylative cross&#8208;coupling processes using the COware gas reactor under activation free conditions. Key to this success is the in&#8208;situ synthesis of aryl formate via an unprecedented nickel/organophotocatalyst system under blue LED irradiation. This developed system demonstrated high applicability to various aryl iodide substrates for synthesizing phenol derivatives. Moreover, the generated CO could be utilized in a range of carbonylative C&#8208;heteroatom and C&#8208;C processes. Notably, commercially available H13COONa salt can serve as a bifunctional reagent for both synthesizing phenols and generating 13CO.</dc:description>

         <title>Access to diverse carbonyl compounds by catalyst&#8208;free and photoinduced aerobic cleavage of C=N bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functional group interconversion is of great significance in organic synthesis. However, aerobic cleavage of C=N bonds to access carbonyl compounds still suffered from some limitations such as harsh reaction conditions, stoichiometric oxidants, poor substrate scope and use of toxic reagents. Herein, we report a catalyst&#8208;free and photo&#8208;induced aerobic cleavage of C=N bonds to afford diverse carbonyl compounds using oxygen from air as green oxidant. This mild methodology permits N&#8208;tosylhydrazones converted into the corresponding carbonyl compounds including ketones, amides, aldehydes and carboxylic acids, showing broad functional group tolerance and compatibility. Moreover, the gram&#8208;scale reaction and post&#8208;modification of complicated molecules proved the applicability and efficiency of this strategy. Finally, a plausible mechanism was proposed based on spectroscopic investigations and detailed mechanistic studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Complexes of a Frustrated Lewis Pair&#8208;Supported P(&#8211;1) Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Several complexes of the intramolecular frustrated Lewis pair (FLP)&#8208;supported P(&#8211;1) ligand [iPr2P(C6H4)BCy2{P}]&#8211; are presented (Cy = cyclohexyl). Chief among these is the first example of a monomeric zinc bis(phosphido) complex, which was synthesized as a potential precursor for the solution&#8208;phase deposition of Zn3P2. While this goal was ultimately unsuccessful, the Zn(II) complex acts as a convenient springboard to other metal phosphide species via transmetallation: namely, a tellurium bis(phosphido) and a formal adduct of the phosphorus subhalide PPCl2. Trapping experiments show that the PPCl2 adduct can also be prepared directly through the in situ reduction of PCl3 in the presence of an intramolecular FLP ligand. Lastly, we report a formal &#951;2&#8208;phosphaborene complex of cobalt(&#8208;1) which is isoelectronic to olefin complexes, and explore its bonding via density functional theory (DFT) computations.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Synthesis for Benzofuro[3,2&#8208;d]pyrimidin&#8208;2&#8208;Amines via One&#8208;Pot Cascade [4 + 2] Annulation/Aromatization between Benzofuran&#8208;Derived Azadienes&#160;and Carbodiimide Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemoselective [4+2] annulation/aromatization reactions between benzofuran&#8208;derived azadienes and N&#8208;Ts cyanamides are developed, affording a convenient method for synthesizing benzofuro[3,2&#8208;d]pyrimidin&#8208;2&#8208;amines under mild conditions.

         <title>Ferrocenyl Dithiophosphonate Ag(I) Complexes: Synthesis, Structures, Luminescence, and Electrocatalytic Water Splitting Tuned by Nuclearity and Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The heterometallic [Ag(I)/Fe(II)] molecular electrocatalysts for hydrogen production were introduced here to recognize the mutual role of metallic nuclearity and ligand engineering. A series of ferrocenyl dithiophosphonate stabilized mononuclear [Ag(PPh3)2{S2PFc(OR)}] {where R = Me (1), Et (2), nPr (3), iPr (4), iAmyl (5); Fc = Fe (&#627;5&#8208;C5H4)(&#627;5&#8208;C5H5) } and dinuclear [Ag(PPh3){S2PFc(OR}]2 {where R = Et (2a), and nPr (3a)} complexes were synthesized and characterized by SCXRD, NMR (31P and 1H), ESI&#8208;MS, UV&#8208;Vis, and FT&#8208;IR spectroscopy. The comparative electrocatalytic HER behavior of 1&#8722;5 and 2a&#8722;3a showed effective current density of 1 mA/cm2 with overpotentials ranging from 772 to 991 mV, demonstrating the influence of extended and branched carbon chains in dithiophosphonates and metallic (mono&#8208;/di&#8208;) nuclearity, which correlates with documented tetra&#8208;nuclear [Ag4(S2PFc(OnPr)4], 6. DFT study suggests the coordinated (&#956;1&#8208;S) site of ligands is the reactivity center and the adsorption energy of intermediate [H*&#8208;SM] varies with the engineering of ligand and nuclearity. A catalytic mechanism using mononuclear (1) and di&#8208;nuclear (2a) was proposed with the assistance of DFT. Each complex, being the first example of Ag(I) dithiophosphonates, exhibits intense photoluminescence with high quantum yields ranging from 33% to 67%. These results link the lower nuclearity structures to their physical and catalytic properties.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>&#960;&#8208;Electronic molecules with a BN&#8208;heterocyclic and carbon&#8208;based aromatic hybrid ring system (h&#8208;CBN) are interesting in that they potentially exhibit synergistic properties arising from the two different &#960;&#8208;systems. Here we report the synthesis and properties of a h&#8208;CBN&#8208;type molecule (1) having a bicyclic B4N4&#8208;heteropentalene core fused with extended aromatic rings. This molecule exhibits excellent chemical stability despite the absence of bulky substituents for kinetic protection, which in turn provides effective stacking of the &#960;&#8208;system upon crystallization. Depending on the crystallization solvent, 1 forms two polymorphs, i.e., the &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;phases. While both phases have one&#8208;dimensional columnar structures, the &#960;&#8208;stacking geometries associated with the transfer integrals of the frontier orbitals are different, resulting in a twofold difference in the electrical conducting properties. We also found that upon thermal vacuum deposition, 1 gives an amorphous film, which serves as a host material for a red phosphorescent OLED device (maximum external quantum efficiency: 15.5 and 13.3% at 0.1 and 2.5 mA, respectively).</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescence of Aggregated Aromatic Peptides for Studying the Kinetics of Aggregation and Hardening of Amyloid&#8208;like Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic fluorescence anisotropy of peptide based amyloid&#8208;like structures gives clues about kinetics of aggregation and hardening of these supramolecular architectures.







Abstract
The capability of amyloid&#8208;like peptide fibers to emit intrinsic&#8208;fluorescence enables the study of their formation, stability and hardening through time&#8208;resolved fluorescence analysis, without the need for additional intercalating dyes. This approach allows the monitoring of amyloid&#8208;like peptides aggregation kinetics using minimal sample volumes, and the simultaneous testing of numerous experimental conditions and analytes, offering rapid and reproducible results. The analytical procedure applied to the aromatic hexapeptide F6, alone or derivatized with PEG (polyethylene glycol) moiety of different lengths, suggests that aggregation into large anisotropic structures negatively correlates with initial monomer concentration and relies on the presence of charged N&#8208; and C&#8208;termini. PEGylation reduces the extent of aggregates hardening, possibly by retaining water, and overall impacts the final structural properties of the aggregates.

         <title>Fluorogenic in&#8208;situ Labelling of Gelatin Polymer in Aqueous Solution and Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical fluorogenic gelatin labelling was achieved directly in the aqueous phase using water&#8208;soluble tetraphenylethylene fluorophores via multivalent tetrazolate&#8208;amine electrostatic interactions during macromolecular encapsulation. This strategy allowed the construction of fluorescence&#8208;responsive hydrogel biomaterials exhibiting dynamic behaviors upon salting&#8208;in/out treatments, and enabled high spatio&#8208;temporal imaging of the hydrogel network for biomedical applications.







Abstract
Gelatin polymers made from partially degraded collagen are important biomaterials, but their in&#8208;situ analysis suffers from uncontrollable covalent labelling and poor spatial&#8208;temporal imaging resolution. Herein, three tetrazolate&#8208;tagged tetraphenylethylene fluorophores (TPE&#8722;TAs) are introduced for practical fluorogenic labelling of gelatin in aqueous phase and hydrogels. These probes with aggregation&#8208;induced emission characteristics offer negligible background and elicit turn&#8208;on fluorescence by simply mixing with the gelatin in aqueous phase, giving a detection limit of 0.15&#8197;mg/L over a linear dynamic range up to 100&#8197;mg/L. This method does not work for collagens and causes minimal interference with gelatin properties. Mechanistic studies reveal a key role for multivalent electrostatic interactions between the abundant basic residues in gelatin (e.&#8201;g., lysine, hydroxylysine, arginine) and anionic tetrazolate moieties of the lipophilic fluorophore synergistically in spatially rigid macromolecular encapsulation to achieve fluorogenic labelling. The AIE strategy by forming non&#8208;covalent fluorophore&#8208;gelatin complexes was developed for novel hydrogels that exhibited reversible fluorescence in response to dynamic microstructural changes in the hydrogel scaffold upon salting&#8208;in/out treatments, and enabled high spatial&#8208;temporal imaging of the fiber network in lyophilized samples. This work may open up avenues for in&#8208;situ imaging analysis and evaluation of gelatin&#8208;based biomaterials during processes such as in&#8197;vivo degradation and mineralization.

         <title>Uncatalyzed Diboron Activation by a Strained Hydrocarbon: Experimental and Theoretical Study of [1.1.1]Propellane Diborylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This report reveals that a special apolar hydrocarbon can activate a boron&#8208;boron bond to produce its electrophilic diborylation. Interestingly, this unique reaction occurs with surprising ease within minutes at room temperature, and its detailed mechanistic study has revealed several disruptive features in the context of both propellane and diboron chemistries.







Abstract
The synthesis of strained carbocyclic building blocks is relevant for Medicinal Chemistry, and methylenecyclobutanes are particularly challenging with current synthetic technology. Careful inspection of the reactivity of [1.1.1]propellane and diboron reagents has revealed that bis(catecholato)diboron (B2cat2) can produce a bis(borylated) methylenecyclobutane in a few minutes at room temperature. This reaction constitutes the first example of B&#8722;B bond activation by a special apolar hydrocarbon and also the first time that propellane is electrophilically activated by boron. Mechanistic studies including in&#8197;situ NMR kinetics and DFT calculations demonstrate that the diboron moiety can be directly activated through coordination with the inverted sigma bond of propellane, and reveal that DMF is involved in the stabilization of diboronate ylide intermediates rather than the activation of the B&#8722;B bond. These results enable new possibilities for both diboron and propellane chemistry, and for further developments in the synthesis of methylenecyclobutanes based on propellane strain release.

         <title>Research Progress on Ni&#8208;based Electrocatalysts for Electrochemical Reduction of Nitrogen to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical NRR&#160;to synthesize ammonia&#160;is considered as a promising method due to its approvable advantages of zero&#8208;pollution emission, feasible reaction proceedings, good safety and easy management. The multiple efforts have been devoted to the exploration of earth&#8208;abundant&#8208;element&#8208;based nanomaterials as high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts for realizing their industrial applications. Among these, the Ni&#8208;based nanomaterials is prioritized as an attractive non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal electrocatalysts for catalyzing NRR because they are earth&#8208;abundance and exceedingly easy to synthesize as well as also delivers the potential of high electrocatalytic activity and durability. In this review, after briefly elucidating the underlying mechanisms of NRR during the electrochemical process, we systematically sum up the recent research progress in representative Ni&#8208;based electrocatalysts, including monometallic Ni&#8208;based nanomaterials, bimetallic Ni&#8208;based nanomaterials, polymetallic Ni&#8208;based nanomaterials, etc. In particular, we discuss the effects of physicochemical properties, such as phases, crystallinity, morphology, composition, defects, heteroatom doping, and strain engineering, on the comprehensive performance of the abovementioned electrocatalysts, with the aim of establishing the nanostructure&#8208;function relationships of the electrocatalysts. In addition, the promising directions of Ni&#8208;based electrocatalysts for NRR are also pointed out and highlighted. The generic approach in this review may expand the frontiers of NRR and provides the inspiration for developing high&#8208;efficiently Ni&#8208;based electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Bi2Mo3O12: A Dual&#8208;Functional material for electrocatalytic water splitting and supercapacitor applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study explores the functionality of &#945;&#8208;Bi2Mo3O12 (BMO) as an electrocatalyst for water splitting and its suitability for supercapacitor applications. BMO was synthesized by the solvothermal method and characterized in pre&#8208;calcination [BMO (BC)], post&#8208;calcination [BMO (AC)], and base&#8208;etched forms [BMO (BE)]. Structural analysis confirmed the formation of &#945;&#8208;Bi2Mo3O12 with well&#8208;defined crystallographic planes. Electrochemical analysis revealed that BMO (AC) exhibited the lowest overpotential for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and BMO (BC) exhibited the lowest overpotential for oxygen evolution reactions (OER), indicating its superior electrocatalytic activity. The Tafel slope and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results confirmed the superior kinetics and charge transfer properties of BMO material. Furthermore, BMO samples demonstrated excellent stability during prolonged chronoamperometry (CA) testing for 12 h. For supercapacitor performances, the BMO (BE) exhibits a superior specific capacitance value of 398 F/g at 2.0 A/g. Thus, the BMO material delivers prominent electrocatalytic activity as well as supercapacitor performance. Overall, this study demonstrates the potentiality of &#945;&#8208;Bi2Mo3O12 in different forms as a dual&#8208;functional material for efficient energy storage and conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Quantum Coherence of Reversible Photo&#8208;generated Radical and Its Film</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electron spin qubits are becoming an important research direction in the field of quantum computing and information storage. However, the quantum decoherence has seriously hindered the development of this field. So far, few qubits exhibit long phase memory time (Tm), and even fewer qubits that can reach room temperature. Some reports show that the coherence times of radicals are generally long, so radicals may be the preferred spin carriers for qubits. Here, we demonstrate the qubit properties of a photogenerated radical (1a) based on 2,4,6&#8208;Tri(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (tpt, 1). More importantly, the photogenerated radical is a spin self&#8208;diluting complex, which the dilution is generally used in the investigation of qubits to reduce the interference of environment on qubits in order to overcome the decoherence of qubits. It is surprised that radical tpt has a stable Tm = 1.1 &#956;s above 20 K, even keep it to room temperature. In addition, the tpt&#8208;film prepared by the vacuum evaporation is significantly increase the T1 and Tm at low temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Discrete Macrocyclic Polymers Hosts Induced Cascade Luminescence Enhancement and Application in Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The integration of polymers, supramolecular macrocycles and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) molecules provides numerous possibilities for constructing various functional supramolecular systems. Herein, we constructed supramolecular assembled systems based on discrete macrocyclic polymer hosts via the cooperation of hydra&#8208;headed macrocycles containing two or three pillar[5]arene units (defined as P2, P3), the block polymer F127 and AIE molecules (alkyl&#8208;cyano modified tetraphenylethene, alkyl&#8208;triazole&#8208;cyano modified 9,10&#8208;distyrylanthracene, defined as TPE&#8208;(CN)4 and DSA&#8208;(TACN)2). Compared with the binary assembly between hydra&#8208;headed hosts or F127 and AIE molecules, cascaded supramolecular assembly&#8208;induced emission enhancement (SAIEE) in aqueous solution was achieved in discrete macrocyclic polymer&#8208;based supramolecular assembled systems. Considering the cascaded SAIEE performance, we have successfully applied discrete macrocyclic polymer&#8208;based supramolecular assembled systems to bioimaging and constructed an artificial light&#8208;harvesting system (LHs) to explore more potential applications. The supramolecular assembly form of discrete macrocyclic polymers hosts and AIE molecules proposed in this work provides new inspiration for the construction and application of high&#8208;performance supramolecular luminescent systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Reduced Surface Area for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Porous Electrode via Electrical Conductivity Relaxation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance of porous electrode is critical for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). However, the effects of gas diffusion on the ORR in porous media need further investigation, although some issues, such as nonthermal surface oxygen exchange, have been attributed to gas diffusion. Herein, La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3&#8208;&#948; (LSCF) with various porosity, pore radii and gas permeability were investigated via the electrical conductivity relaxation method and analysed using the distributed of characteristic time (DCT) model. The ORR is revealed with three characteristic times, which are gas diffusion, oxygen exchange via the surface corresponding to small pores, and oxygen exchange to large pores. Gas diffusion delays the oxygen surface exchange reaction, resulting in very low chemical oxygen surface exchange coefficient compared with that obtained with dense sample under the assumption that all the surfaces are active for the ORR. Reduced surface area is thus defined to quantitatively represent the gas diffusion effects. The reduced surface area increases with increasing gas permeability, demonstrating the importance of electrode engineering for fast gas transport. Moreover, reduced surface area is suggested for replacing the specific surface area to calculate the electrode polarization resistance using the ALS model.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The synthetic methodology for the preparation of photoresponsive dioxazaborocanes&#8208;containing oligomers is developed. It relies on the transformation of the (diisopropylamino)boryl group (&#8208;BH(NiPr2)) into a dioxazaborocane unit in the presence &#946;&#8208;aminodiols and involves a bis&#8208;borylated dithienylethene photochromic unit. The photophysical properties of the obtained oligomers are evaluated as well as their processability for the preparation of spin&#8208;coated films. The photomechanical behavior of the resulting films is assessed via displacement tracking profile.</dc:description>

         <title>Amplifying reactivity of bio&#8208;inspired [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase mimics by organic nanotubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A bio&#8208;inspired FeFe hydrogenase model which catalyses hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic solutions is immobilized in polyaniline (PANI)&#8208;based nanotubes. A combination of analytical techniques reveals that this construct maintains both the molecular signatures of the bio&#8208;inspired complex and the material properties of PANI. The amine and imine&#8208;rich environment of the PANI chain amplifies the inherent HER activity of the bio&#8208;inspired complex, allowing electrocatalytic HER at neutral pH, with lower overpotentials and higher current densities compared to the bio&#8208;inspired complex alone. This construct retains the oxygen stability of the bio&#8208;inspired complex and remains stable through several hours of aerobic electrolysis, producing only 6.5% H2O2 from the competing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).</dc:description>

         <title>The possible aromatic conjugation via the different edges of (car)borane clusters &#8722; Can the relationship between 3D and 2D aromatic systems be reconciled?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The possible aromatic conjugation between 3D and 2D aromatic units is in the focus since the synthesis of benzocarborane. It has been showed that in the 3D aromatic icosahedral 1,2&#8208;dicarba&#8208;closo&#8208;dodecaborane systems fused with 2D aromatic rings a global 3D/2D aromaticity does not exist. Despite this fact during the last years several studies propose interactions between 2D and 3D moieties. Herein, while tuning the size and the effective charge of the (car)borane systems, we demonstrate that global aromatic character can be excluded in any investigated cases, and the detectable conjugative properties can be explained the effect of the well&#8208;known negative hyperconjugation.</dc:description>

         <title>Aerobic Oxidation of PMB Ethers to Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With Fe(NO3)3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;9H2O and TEMPO as cocatalysts and oxygen as green oxidant, PMB ethers have been converted to carboxylic acids at room temperature with high efficiency and selectivity. Total synthesis of naturally occuring (R)&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;7,9&#8208;octadecadiynoic acid has been realized by applying this protocol as key step. A mechanism involving oxygen&#8208;stabilized benzylic cation has been proposed based on careful studies.







Abstract
The first aerobic protocol of direct transformation of p&#8208;methoxybenzyl (PMB) ethers to carboxylic acids efficiently with Fe(NO3)3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;9H2O and TEMPO as catalysts at room temperature has been developed. The reaction accommodates C&#8722;Br bond, terminal/non&#8208;terminal C&#8722;C triple bond, amide, cyano, nitro, ester, and trifluoromethyl groups. Even highly selective oxidative deprotection of different benzylic PMB ethers has been realized. The reaction has been successfully applied to the total synthesis of natural product, (R)&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;7,9&#8208;octadecadiynoic acid, demonstrating the practicality of the method. Based on experimental studies, a possible mechanism involving oxygen&#8208;stabilized benzylic cation has been proposed.

         <title>Pd/C Catalyzed Selective N&#8208;monomethylation by Transfer Hydrogenation of Urea derivatives using Methanol as H2 and C1 Sources</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;monomethyl amines are useful intermediates in drugs, natural products, paints. Yet their synthesis is a tremendous challenge due to their high reactivity, typically leading to overmethylation. In this contribution, a highly selective catalytic N&#8208;methylation methodology is reported, converting urea derivatives to monomethylated amines, using a commercially available heterogeneous Pd/C catalyst and methanol as unique reagent. Methanol provides a sustainable alternative protocol for the selective preparation of mono&#8208;methylated derivatives as it acts as both H2 and C1 sources. In addition, several control experiments were performed to provide a proposal for the mechanism, namely dehydrogenation of methanol and subsequent hydrogenation of urea derivatives, followed by reduction of the in situ formed methyl imine. Importantly, the approach is simple, highly productive and enables novel synthetic procedures for the preparation of monomethylamines from urea derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Reactivity, and Bonding Analysis of a Tetracoordinated Nickel Carbene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nickel carbenes are key reactive intermediates in the catalytic cyclopropanation of olefins and other reactions, but isolated examples are scarce and generally rely on low coordination numbers (&#8804; 3) to stabilize the metal&#8211;ligand multiple bond. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a stable tetracoordinated nickel carbene bearing a triphosphine pincer ligand. Its nucleophilic character is evidenced by reaction with acids, and it can transfer the carbene fragment to CO to form a ketene. A computational study of the Ni=C chemical bond sheds light on the role of the third phosphine in the pincer framework to the stabilization of the nickel carbene fragment.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrasonication&#8208;Boosted Resorcinol&#8208;Formaldehyde Resin Nanoparticle Bromine Fixation and Corresponding Upgraded Aquatic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bromine (Br2) and related species removal from water systems are rather complicated due to the complicated chemistry instability, and materials with high Br2 removal rate and efficiency, along with stimuli/apparatus suitable for highly corrosive environments, are necessary. Ultrasonication as a non&#8208;destructive process is especially suitable in scenarios where conventional stir apparatus is not applicable, such as highly corrosive environments. Considering the validity nature of Br2 and combining the advantages of ultrasonic with a highly stable Br2 fixation method through aromatic polymer nanoparticles, we demonstrate highly efficient acoustic&#8208;aided Br2 removal in aqueous solutions with two times capacity compared to the non&#8208;treated sample. Related aquatic applications are also proposed for the materials to be cost&#8208;effective, including silver (Ag) recovery, recyclable MnO2&#8208;mediated Br2 deep removal, and aqueous zinc anode modification. The coupled novel&#8208;material&#8208;based processes motivate the strategic design of water purification with high&#8208;safety and sustainable industrial procedures and post&#8208;value&#8208;added utilizations.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Coordinate Dinuclear Donor&#8208;Gold(I)&#8208;Acceptor Complexes Exhibiting Multiple Excitation Wavelength Dependent Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;coordinate Au(I) complexes with a donor&#8208;metal&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;M&#8208;A) structure have shown rich luminescent properties. However, charge&#8208;neutral dinuclear donor&#8208;metal&#8208;acceptor type Au(I) complexes featuring aurophilic interactions have been seldom explored. Herein, we describe the structures and photoluminescence properties of two dinuclear Au(I) complexes, namely DiAu&#8208;Ph and DiAu&#8208;Me. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis of DiAu&#8208;Ph reveals a short intramolecular Au&#8208;Au distance of 3.224 &#197;. In dilute solution and doped films, excitation wavelength dependent multiple phosphorescence phenomena were observed for these dinuclear complexes. Theoretical calculations reveal that the aurophilic interaction causes increased contribution of the Au d orbital to the highest occupied molecular orbitals. Thus, the gap between singlet and triplet excited states (&#916;EST) is enlarged, which disables the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Moreover, the large energy separation (0.45&#8208;0.52 eV) and the different orbital configurations between the various excited states result in an inefficient internal conversion, accounting for their multiple phosphorescence properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Janus Reactivity of Crownphyrinoids: Alkali&#8208; vs. Transition Metal&#8208;Mediated Transformations of Crown Ether&#8208;Porphyrin Hybrids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crownphyrinogens and crownphyrins constitute a group of macrocycles that combine the structural facets of porphyrinoids and crown ethers. The dual&#8208;nature cavity embedded in their molecules enables reactivity involving two structurally distinct parts of the macrocyclic ligand. Upon Ni(II) and Pd(II) insertion, coordination compounds are produced wherein the metal is incorporated into the porphyrinoid&#8208;like pocket, resulting in monomeric or accordion&#8208;like dimeric products, depending on the oxidation level of the macrocycle and metal cation. The reactions with Na(I) and K(I) resulted in the formation of complexes where only the crown ether segment of the molecule is involved in metal binding, yielding remarkable dimeric species. The exploitation of a crownphyrin large enough to accommodate two metal cations allowed the synthesis of an alkali/transition metal binuclear complexes wherein the macrocycle demonstrated the Janus reactivity with one cavity acting as a porphyrinoid, and the other mimicking the crown ether.</dc:description>

         <title>Advancements and Challenges in the Synthesis of Oxymethylene Ethers (OMEs) as Sustainable Transportation Fuels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 48, August 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept reviews the recent advancements in the field of oxymethylene ether (OME) production. We discuss mechanistic details as well as synthesis conditions examined in the last decade. We identified the Schulz&#8208;Flory product distribution, the energy efficiency, the influence of water as well as the production of suitable starting materials as the main challenges to establishing a large&#8208;scale OME production.







Abstract
The urgent need for sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels in the transportation sector is driving research into novel energy carriers that can meet the high energy density requirements of heavy&#8208;duty vehicles without exacerbating the climate change. This concept article examines the synthesis, mechanisms, and challenges associated with oxymethylene ethers (OMEs), a promising class of synthetic fuels potentially derived from carbon dioxide and hydrogen. We highlight the importance of OMEs in the transition towards non&#8208;fossil energy sources due to their compatibility with the existing Diesel infrastructure and their cleaner combustion profile. The synthesis mechanisms, including the Schulz&#8208;Flory distribution and its implications for OME chain length specificity, and the role of various catalysts and starting materials are discussed in depth. Despite advancements in the field, significant challenges remain, such as overcoming the Schulz&#8208;Flory distribution, efficiently managing water as an undesirable byproduct, and improving the overall energy efficiency of the OME synthesis. Addressing these challenges is crucial for OMEs to become a viable alternative fuel, contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the transition to a sustainable energy future in the transportation sector.

         <title>Redox Behaviour and Redox Potentials of Dyes in Aqueous Buffers and Protic Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 48, August 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;active protic ionic liquids hold promise as low&#8208;cost, high energy density electrolytes for redox flow batteries. Their redox behaviour is similar to parent salts in pH&#8208;neutral aqueous buffer, although they may undergo different side reactions. In this work, fortuitous side&#8208;reactions yield quinone&#8208;imines which display promising electrochemistry for flow battery applications.







Abstract
Organic dyes hold promise as inexpensive electrochemically&#8208;active building blocks for new renewable energy technologies such as redox&#8208;flow batteries and dye&#8208;sensitised solar cells, especially if they display high oxidation and/or low reduction potentials in cheap, non&#8208;flammable solvents such as water or protic ionic liquids. Systematic computational and experimental characterisation of a representative selection of acidic and basic dyes in buffered aqueous solutions and propylammonium formate confirm that quinoid&#8208;type mechanisms impart electrochemical reversibility for the majority of systems investigated, including quinones, fused tricyclic heteroaromatics, indigo carmine and some aromatic nitrogenous species. Conversely, systems that generate longlived radical intermediates &#8211; arylmethanes, hydroquinones at high pH, azocyclic systems &#8211; tend to display irreversible electrochemistry, likely undergoing ring&#8208;opening, dimerisation and/or disproportionation reactions.

A BODIPY derivative BDP&#8208;TR was identified as a non&#8208;biased red&#8208;fluorescent dye for labelling of low molecular weight (pro)drugs. The labelling does not affect intracellular localization and mode of action of the (pro)drugs. The BDP&#8208;TR&#8208;conjugates were used to clarify the mechanism of activation and in&#8197;vivo distribution of the representative (pro)drugs.







Abstract
Red fluorescent dyes are usually charged, lipophilic molecules with relatively high molecular weight, which tend to localize in specific intracellular locations, e.&#8201;g., a cyanine dye Cy5 is biased towards mitochondria. They are often used as markers of biomolecules including nucleic acids and proteins. Since the molecular weight of the dyes is much smaller than that of the biomolecules, the labelling has a negligible effect on the properties of the biomolecules. In contrast, conjugation of the dyes to low molecular weight (pro)drugs can dramatically alter their properties. For example, conjugates of Cy5 with lysosome&#8208;targeting aminoferrocenes accumulate in mitochondria and exhibit no intracellular effects characteristic for the parent (pro)drugs. Herein we tested several neutral and negatively charged dyes for labelling lysosome&#8208;targeting aminoferrocenes 7 and 8 as well as a non&#8208;targeted control 3. We found that a BODIPY derivative BDP&#8208;TR exhibits the desired unbiased properties: the conjugation does not disturb the intracellular localization of the (pro)drugs, their mode of action, and cancer cell specificity. We used the conjugates to clarify the mechanism of action of the aminoferrocenes. In particular, we identified new intermediates, explained why lysosome&#8208;targeting aminoferrocenes are more potent than their non&#8208;targeted counterparts, and evaluated their distribution in&#8197;vivo.

         <title>Facile Synthesis and Characterization of Uniform Au Nanospheres Capped by Citrate for Biomedical Applications</title>

Ligand exchange. By depositing one atomic layer of fresh Au atoms onto CTAB/CTAC&#8208;capped 10&#8208;nm Au spheres in the presence of citrate at an adequate concentration, the original surface&#8208;bound CTAB/CTAC is replaced with citrate. The newly formed citrate&#8208;capped 10&#8208;nm Au spheres show a decrease in cell toxicity.







Abstract
We report a simple and versatile method for effectively replacing the toxic ligands, such as cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC), on the surface of Au nanospheres with different sizes by citrate. The method involves the deposition of an ultrathin shell of fresh Au in the presence of sodium citrate at an adequate concentration. After the ligand exchange process, multiple techniques are used to confirm that the surface of the resultant Au nanospheres is covered by citrate while there is no sign of aggregation. We also demonstrate the mitigation of cell toxicity after exchanging the surface&#8208;bound CTAB/CTAC with citrate, opening the door to a range of biomedical applications.

         <title>Coinage Metal Complexes of a Sterically Encumbered Anionic Pyridylborate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 48, August 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sterically loaded anionic pyridyl borate ligand has been utilized successfully to stabilize two&#8208;coordinate gold, silver, and copper phosphine complexes and a gold isocyanide complex, and to probe their solid&#8208;state structures, bonding, and spectroscopic features.







Abstract
Sterically loaded, anionic pyridine has been synthesized and utilized successfully in the stabilization of a isoleptic series of coinage metal complexes. The treatment of [4&#8208;(Ph3B)&#8208;2,6&#8208;Trip2Py]K (Trip=2,4,6&#8208;iPr3C6H2) with CuBr(PPh3), AgCl(PPh3) or AuCl(PPh3) (Py=pyridine) afforded the corresponding [4&#8208;(Ph3B)&#8208;2,6&#8208;Trip2Py]M(PPh3) (M=Au, Ag, Cu) complexes, via salt metathesis, as isolable, crystalline solids. Notably, these reactions avoid the facile single electron transfer chemistry reported with the less bulky ligand systems. The X&#8208;ray structures revealed that they are two&#8208;coordinate metal adducts. The M&#8722;N and M&#8722;P bond distances are longest in the silver and shortest in the copper adduct among the three group 11 family members. Computational analysis revealed an interesting stability dependence on steric bulk of the anionic pyridine (i.&#8201;e., pyridyl borate) ligand. A comparison of structures and bonding of [4&#8208;(Ph3B)&#8208;2,6&#8208;Trip2Py]Au(PPh3) to pyridine and m&#8208;terphenyl complexes, {[2,6&#8208;Trip2Py]Au(PPh3)}[SbF6] and [2,6&#8208;Trip2Ph]Au(PPh3) are also provided. The Au(I) isocyanide complex, [4&#8208;(Ph3B)&#8208;2,6&#8208;Trip2Py]Au(CNBut) has been stabilized using the same anionic pyridylborate illustrating that it can support other gold&#8208;ligand moieties as well.

         <title>Dioxygen Activation by Gold(I)&#8208;Distorted Porphyrin Dinuclear Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 48, August 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of dinuclear gold(I) porphyrin complexes that could activate dioxygen (O2) in polar protic solvents was synthesized and their reactivities were evaluated. The revealed mechanistic insights indicate the coordination of O2 to a gold center and the importance of hydrogen bonding of an NH proton in a porphyrin ligand.







Abstract
Interactions between gold&#8208;based materials and dioxygen (O2) have motivated researchers to understand reaction mechanisms for O2 activation by homo&#8208; and heterogeneous gold catalysts. In this work, gold(I) porphyrin dinuclear complexes were synthesized with a saddle&#8208;distorted porphyrin ligand. The gold(I) porphyrin complexes showed unprecedented O2 activation in the presence of protic solvents to form gold(III) tetradentate porphyrin complexes. Mechanistic insights into the O2 activation by the gold(I) center were elucidated by spectroscopic measurements and theoretical calculations, revealing that dissociation of halides on the gold(I) center by alcohol solvents and hydrogen bonding of an N&#8722;H proton in the distorted porphyrin with dioxygen played important roles in establishing the unique reactivities of gold(I) complexes.

         <title>Designed Mannosylerythritol Lipid Analogues Exhibiting Both Selective Cytotoxicity Against Human Skin Cancer Cells and Recovery Effects on Damaged Skin Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 48, August 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthesis of four kinds of mannosylerythritol lipid (MEL) analogues R&#8208;MEL&#8722;A ([2R,3S]&#8208;erythritol type), S&#8208;mannosylthreitol lipid (MTL)&#8208;A ([2S,3S]&#8208;threitol type), R&#8208;MTL&#8722;A ([2R,3R]&#8208;threitol type), and &#945;&#8208;S&#8208;MEL&#8722;A ([2S,3R]&#8208;erythritol type) and their selective cytotoxicity against HSC&#8208;5 cancer cells. The results indicate that R&#8208;MTL&#8722;A has potential as a lead compound for new cosmeceuticals exhibiting both cancer cell&#8208;selective toxicity and recovery effects on damaged skin cells.







Abstract
Mannosylerythritol lipids (MELs) are a class of amphipathic molecules bearing a hydrophilic 4&#8208;O&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;mannopyranosyl&#8208;D&#8208;erythritol skeleton. Here, we designed and synthesized four kinds of MEL analogues R&#8208;MEL&#8722;A ([2R,3S]&#8208;erythritol type), S&#8208;mannosylthreitol lipid (MTL)&#8208;A ([2S,3S]&#8208;threitol type), R&#8208;MTL&#8722;A ([2R,3R]&#8208;threitol type), and &#945;&#8208;S&#8208;MEL&#8722;A ([2S,3R]&#8208;erythritol type) using our previously reported boron&#8208;mediated aglycon delivery (BMAD) method and a neighboring group assisted glycosylation method. The selective cytotoxicity of the target compounds against cancer cells was evaluated, with R&#8208;MTL&#8722;A showing the highest selective cytotoxicity against human skin squamous carcinoma HSC&#8208;5 cells. Our findings suggest that R&#8208;MTL&#8722;A induces necrosis&#8208;like cell death against HSC&#8208;5 cells by decreasing cell membrane fluidity.

&lt;p&gt;We report the synthesis of four kinds of mannosylerythritol lipid (MEL) analogues &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-MEL&#8722;A ([2&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,3&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;]-erythritol type), &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-mannosylthreitol lipid (MTL)-A ([2&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,3&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;]-threitol type), &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-MTL&#8722;A ([2&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,3&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;]-threitol type), and &#945;-&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-MEL&#8722;A ([2&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,3&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;]-erythritol type) and their selective cytotoxicity against HSC-5 cancer cells. The results indicate that &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-MTL&#8722;A has potential as a lead compound for new cosmeceuticals exhibiting both cancer cell-selective toxicity and recovery effects on damaged skin cells.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mannosylerythritol lipids (MELs) are a class of amphipathic molecules bearing a hydrophilic 4-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-&#946;-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;-mannopyranosyl-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;-erythritol skeleton. Here, we designed and synthesized four kinds of MEL analogues &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-MEL&#8722;A ([2&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,3&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;]-erythritol type), &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-mannosylthreitol lipid (MTL)-A ([2&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,3&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;]-threitol type), &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-MTL&#8722;A ([2&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,3&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;]-threitol type), and &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-MEL&#8722;A ([2&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,3&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;]-erythritol type) using our previously reported boron-mediated aglycon delivery (BMAD) method and a neighboring group assisted glycosylation method. The selective cytotoxicity of the target compounds against cancer cells was evaluated, with &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-MTL&#8722;A showing the highest selective cytotoxicity against human skin squamous carcinoma HSC-5 cells. Our findings suggest that &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-MTL&#8722;A induces necrosis-like cell death against HSC-5 cells by decreasing cell membrane fluidity. &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-MTL&#8722;A also exhibits an efficient recovery effect on damaged skin cells, indicating that &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-MTL&#8722;A has potential as a lead compound for new cosmeceuticals with both cancer cell-selective toxicity and recovery effects on damaged skin cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
A formal [4+1]&#8208;cycloaddition of bicyclic D&#8722;A cyclopropanes and thioureas, acting as N,N&#8208;bisnucleophiles, is developed to synthesize analogs of prevalent furolactones, i.&#8201;e. furolactams and related heterocycles.







Abstract
Fused bicyclic cyclopropanes were converted by Lewis acid&#8208;catalysis with thioureas to furo&#8208;, pyrano, and pyrrololactams with yields of up to 99&#8201;% and high diastereoselectivity. The formation of the title compounds, representing a formal [4+1]&#8208;cycloaddition to a donor&#8208;acceptor substituted cyclopropane, follows a cascade reaction involving SN1&#8208;type ring&#8208;opening addition and cyclization. Thiourea, being a cost&#8208;effective and odorless reagent, acts as an N,N&#8208;bis&#8208;nucleophile to generate bicyclic compounds containing an N&#8208;substituted &#947;&#8208;lactam moiety.

         <title>Mechanochemical Regioselective [3+3] Annulation of 6&#8208;Amino Uracil with Propargyl Alcohols Catalyzed by a Br&#248;nsted Acid/Hexafluoroisopropanol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 48, August 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed the first mechanochemical annulation of 6&#8208;amino uracil with tert&#8208;propargyl alcohols by milling with p&#8208;TSA/HFIP. This regioselective annulation proceeds through the allenylation of uracil and subsequent 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization. Interestingly, sec&#8208;propargyl alcohols furnished the propargylation of amino uracil.







Abstract
A mechanochemistry approach is developed for regioselective synthesis of functionalized dihydropyrido[2,3&#8208;d]pyrimidines by milling propargylic alcohols and 6&#8208;aminouracils with HFIP/p&#8208;TsOH. In the case of tert&#8208;propargyl alcohols, this [3+3] cascade annulation proceeded through allenylation of uracil followed by a 6&#8208;endo trig cyclization. With sec&#8208;propargyl alcohols, the reaction furnished the propargylation of uracil. This atom economy ball milling reaction allows access to a broad range of dihydropyrido[2,3&#8208;d]pyrimidine derivatives in excellent yields. We demonstrated the gram scale synthesis of 3&#8201;g and post&#8208;synthetic modifications to effect the cyclization of 5 to 6.

         <title>The Excited&#8208;State N&#8722;H Tautomerization Rate in Free&#8208;Base Corroles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 48, August 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Corrole, akin to porphyrin but with a missing carbon, exhibits unique structural and dynamic properties. Three pyrrolic protons induce a dynamic equilibrium between tautomeric structures, favoring one in excited states due to energy disparities. Despite the tautomerization being known, few studies exist. Ultrafast photoluminescence reveals rates and activation energies, unraveling the excited&#8208;state dynamics.







Abstract
Corrole is a tetrapyrrolic dye with a structure that resembles porphyrin, apart from a single missing carbon. The absence of this carbon results in the re&#8208;arrangement of the double bonds within the macrocycle, and the presence of three pyrrolic protons in the central cavity in its free&#8208;base form. These protons lead to the existence of two distinct tautomeric structures that exist in a dynamic equilibrium. Although the ground&#8208;state energies of the tautomers are similar, the excited states show a significant difference in energy which unbalances the equilibrium between the tautomers and results in rapid excited&#8208;state tautomerization, favouring one tautomeric species over the other. Although the excited&#8208;state tautomerization process has been known for a long time, very few studies have been performed on it, leaving many key aspects of the process poorly understood. Herein we show how ultrafast photoluminescence can be used to experimentally determine the rates of excited&#8208;state tautomerization and activation energies of three free&#8208;base corrole derivatives thus allowing us to completely describe the excited&#8208;state dynamics of the unusual excited state of free&#8208;base corrole and opening the door to the development of new materials that can exploit its unique characteristics.

We disclose herein a novel and general radical approach to alkylthiopurines, encompassing 4 types of thiopurines, as well as their corresponding ribosides. This strategy is achieved through visible light&#8208;mediated late&#8208;stage functionalization of the sulfur atoms of mercaptopurines. The in situ&#8208;generated disulfide was proposed as the pivotal neutral intermediate for this transformation.







Abstract

This strategy is achieved through visible light&#8208;mediated late&#8208;stage functionalization of the sulfur atoms of mercaptopurines. The in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated disulfide was proposed as the pivotal neutral intermediate for this transformation. We present herein a novel photo&#8208;mediated homolytic C&#8722;S bond formation for the preparation of alkylthiopurines and alkylthiopurine nucleosides. Despite the presence of reactive sites for the Minisci reaction, chemoselective S&#8208;alkylation remained the predominant pathway. This method allows for the late&#8208;stage introduction of a broad spectrum of alkyl groups onto the sulfur atom of unprotective mercaptopurine derivatives, encompassing 2&#8208;, 6&#8208;, and 8&#8208;mercaptopurine rings. Organoborons serve as efficient and eco&#8208;friendly alkylating reagents, providing advantages in terms of readily availability, stability, and reduced toxicity. Further derivatization of the thioetherified nucleosides, together with anti&#8208;tumor assays, led to the discovery of potent anti&#8208;tumor agents with an IC50 value reaching 6.1&#8197;&#956;M (Comp. 31 for Jurkat).

We present herein a novel photo-mediated homolytic C&#8722;S bond formation for the preparation of alkylthiopurines and alkylthiopurine nucleosides. Despite the presence of reactive sites for the Minisci reaction, chemoselective &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-alkylation remained the predominant pathway. This method allows for the late-stage introduction of a broad spectrum of alkyl groups onto the sulfur atom of unprotective mercaptopurine derivatives, encompassing 2-, 6-, and 8-mercaptopurine rings. Organoborons serve as efficient and eco-friendly alkylating reagents, providing advantages in terms of readily availability, stability, and reduced toxicity. Further derivatization of the thioetherified nucleosides, together with anti-tumor assays, led to the discovery of potent anti-tumor agents with an IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value reaching 6.1&#8197;&#956;M (Comp. &lt;b&gt;31&lt;/b&gt; for Jurkat).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Sulfilimines via Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Triplet Energy Transfer to Sulfonyl Azides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 48, August 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a novel reactivity of triplet nitrenes toward sulfides to afford sulfilimines. The use of triplet nitrenes as reactive intermediates circumvented the substrate scope limitations of the prior singlet nitrene approaches, as demonstrated by broad functional group tolerance, water compatibility, and amenability to use for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of drugs.







Abstract
Sulfilimines and their derivatives have garnered considerable interest in both synthetic and medicinal chemistry. Photochemical nitrene transfer to sulfides is known as a conventional synthetic approach to sulfilimines. However, the existing methods have a limited substrate scope stemming from the incompatibility of singlet nitrene intermediates with nucleophilic functional groups. Herein, we report the synthesis of N&#8208;sulfonyl sulfilimines via visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated energy transfer to sulfonyl azides, uncovering the previously overlooked reactivity of triplet nitrenes with sulfides. This reaction features broad functional group tolerance, water compatibility, and amenability to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of drugs. Thus, this work represents an important example of energy transfer chemistry that overcomes challenges in traditional synthetic methods.

         <title>Dissolution of g&#8208;C3N4 Using Zinc Chloride Molten Salt Hydrates for Nanobelt Fabrication and Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 48, August 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method has been developed for dissolving g&#8208;C3N4 using ZnCl2 molten salt hydrates, which achieve high solubility (up to 200&#8197;mg/ml) and efficient recovery while maintaining structure. The regenerated C3N4 (r&#8208;C3N4) presents nanobelt morphology and exhibits significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity in H2O2 production.







Abstract
Graphitic&#8208;carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4), a metal&#8208;free two&#8208;dimensional layered semiconductor material, holds great potential for energy conversion, environmental remediation, and sensing. However, the limited solubility of g&#8208;C3N4 in conventional solvents hinders its widespread application. Improving the dissolution of g&#8208;C3N4 in the liquid phase is highly desired but challenging. Herein, we report an innovative approach to dissolve g&#8208;C3N4 using ZnCl2 molten salt hydrates. The solubility of g&#8208;C3N4 in the solution reaches up to 200&#8197;mg&#8201;mL&#8722;1. Density functional theory (DFT) results suggest that ZnCl+H2O is the key species that leads to charge redistribution on g&#8208;C3N4 surface and promotes the dissolution of carbon nitride in the solution. Furthermore, through dilution, the dissolved carbon nitride can be effectively recovered while maintaining its intrinsic chemical structure. The resultant regenerated C3N4 (r&#8208;C3N4) exhibits nanobelt morphology and demonstrates a substantially improved photocatalytic activity in H2O2 production. The rate of H2O2 production over the r&#8208;C3N4 reaches 20,228&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is 6.2 times higher than that of pristine g&#8208;C3N4. This green and efficient dissolution route of g&#8208;C3N4 offers an effective approach for its diverse applications.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Olefination of Aryl Aldehydes Using Propiolates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 48, August 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Propiolates have been demonstrated as olefinating agents in the silver&#8208;catalyzed olefination of aryl and cinnamyl aldehydes to make &#945;,&#946;&#8208; and &#945;,&#946;,&#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated esters with excellent E&#8208;selectivity. Trimethyl orthoformate plays a dual role by generating nucleophilic allenolate from propiolate and more electrophilic oxocarbenium ion from aldehyde to effect the reaction.







Abstract
Olefination of aldehydes is one of the fundamental reactions in organic synthesis. The commonly used Wittig olefination reaction however uses stoichiometric quantities reagents under basic conditions resulting in stoichiometric amounts of byproducts. Known catalytic alternate to the Wittig reaction requires stoichiometric amounts of silane reducing agents and high temperature. Herein, we report a base&#8208;free olefination of aryl aldehydes using propiolates as a surrogate for the Witting reagent under silver catalysis. Trimethyl orthoformate, in the presence of a silver catalyst adds to the alkynoate to form the nucleophilic silver allenolate which reacts with the reactive oxocarbenium ion formed from aldehyde under the reaction conditions. Subsequently, decarbonylation occurs to form the olefin. Trans olefin is formed exclusively from simple aryl aldehydes and cinnamaldehydes. Such a silver allenolate is conceptually novel and has not been explored so far.

         <title>Ring Rearrangement Reactions of 4&#8208;Alkenylisocoumarins and Photophysical Evaluation of Multi&#8208;Substituted Anthracene Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 48, August 27, 2024. </description>

Several &#960;&#8208;extended homophthalates have been synthesised by novel ring&#8208;opening/ring&#8208;closing cascade reaction of lactol silyl ethers bearing acrylate moiety. Thus obtained homophthalates can be used as effective C4 building blocks for polycyclic aromatic systems.







Abstract
Herein we report that readily available 4&#8208;alkenylisocoumarins can be regarded as potent dienolate equivalents. For example, lactol silyl ethers derived from 4&#8208;alkenylisocoumarins were selectively converted to the corresponding benzo&#8208;homophthalates through a fluoride&#8208;induced ring opening step that was followed by a ring closure through a vinylogous intramolecular aldol condensation. Likewise, nucleophilic activation of 4&#8208;alkenylisocoumarins directly yields diversely poly&#8208;substituted naphthalenes and anthracenes without formation of any regioisomer. Photophysical evaluation of a set of thus obtained 1,3&#8208;di&#8208; and 1,3,4&#8208;trisubstituted anthracenes reveals their distinct intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) character during light absorption in polar solutions and excimer emission from the solid state when a face&#8208;to&#8208;face &#960;&#8208;stacked molecular assembly is present in the crystal packing.

         <title>Encapsulation of Cu(II) Terpyridine Complexes into Polymeric Nanoparticles for Enhanced Anticancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 48, August 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, the chemical synthesis and biological evaluation of the encapsulation of a Cu(II) terpyridine complex with the polymer Pluronic F&#8208;127/Poloxamer&#8208;407 into polymeric nanoparticles for anticancer therapy is reported. The nanoparticles were able to overcome the pharmacological shortcomings of the molecular agent and induced a strong therapeutic effect in the nanomolar range.







Abstract
Cancer is one of the deadliest diseases worldwide. One of the most commonly applied therapeutic techniques to combat this disease is chemotherapy. Despite its success, the majority of clinically applied chemotherapeutic agents are associated with strong side effects and drug resistance. To overcome this limitation, much research efforts are devoted toward the development of new anticancer agents. Among the most promising class of compounds, Cu(II) complexes have emerged. Despite their strong cytotoxic effect, these agents are typically associated with low water solubility, low stability, and poor tumor selectivity. To overcome these limitations, herein, we report on the encapsulation of a promising Cu(II) terpyridine complex with the Pluronic F&#8208;127/Poloxamer&#8208;407 polymeric carrier into nanoparticles. Besides overcoming the pharmacological drawbacks, the nanoparticles were able to eradicate human breast adenocarcinoma monolayer cells as well as challenging multicellular tumor spheroids at nanomolar concentrations.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;promoted C(sp3)&#8208;H &#945;&#8208;Carbamoylation of Cyclic Ethers with Isocyanides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 48, August 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
C(sp3)&#8208;H carbamoylation of cyclic ethers has been achieved via a domino sequence of Hydrogen Atom Transfer/Radical Polar Crossover pathways, finally enabling the nucleophilic addition of isocyanides to oxocarbenium ions. The current method features mild reaction conditions to generate oxocarbenium ions from non&#8208;activated ethers, along with good substrate scope and functional group compatibility.







Abstract
A protocol exploiting isocyanides as carbamoylating agents for the &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H functionalization of cyclic ethers has been optimized via a combined visible light&#8208;driven hydrogen atom transfer/Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed approach. The isocyanide substrate scope revealed an exquisite functional group compatibility (18 examples, with yields up to 99&#8201;%). Both radical and polar trapping, kinetic isotopic effect and real&#8208;time NMR studies support the mechanistic hypothesis and provide insightful details for the design of new chemical processes involving the generation of oxocarbenium ions.

         <title>Multicomponent Synthesis of 3(2H)&#8208;Furanones Initiated by Copper(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Alkyne&#8208;Carbonyl Cross Metathesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 48, August 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cooperative Lewis&#8208; and Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis enables a multicomponent synthesis of 3(2H)&#8208;furanones from 1,3&#8208;diynes, alkyl glyoxylates and water, in which a highly chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselective alkyne&#8208;carbonyl cross metathesis of 1,3&#8208;diynes has been developed and suggested as the initial step of the annulation.







Abstract
The cooperative Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis makes convergent synthesis of 3(2H)&#8208;furanones through a three&#8208;component coupling of 1,3&#8208;diynes, alkyl glyoxylates and water. Control experiments support that Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed highly chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselective alkyne&#8208;carbonyl metathesis of 1,3&#8208;diynes and alkyl glyoxylates might be the initial step of this multicomponent annulation. Further chemo&#8208; and regioselective hydration of the alkyne&#8208;carbonyl metathesis product and subsequent oxa&#8208;Michael addition promoted by Br&#248;nsted acid results in the formation of two C&#8722;O bonds of the five&#8208;membered oxygen heterocycle.

         <title>Design of Triphenylamine&#8208;based D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A Systems for Efficient Ternary WORM Memory Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 48, August 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The resistive switching memory behaviour of D&#8722;A architectured triphenylamine&#8208;based small organic molecules has been investigated. Conversion from binary to ternary WORM memory is achieved through fine&#8208;tuning substituents on the D&#8722;A system, which paves the way for the strategic design of molecules for developing highly efficient data storage systems.







Abstract
The impact of various substituent moieties on the molecular framework of a conjugated D&#8722;A system in resistive switching memory property has been scrutinized through an array of novel D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A molecules. The synthesized molecules with triphenylamine (TPA) as the electron donor and dicyanovinylindanone (IC) as the electron acceptor demonstrated substantial non&#8208;volatile WORM (Write&#8208;Once Read&#8208;Many) memory behaviour with appreciable ON/OFF current ratios up to 105 and a lowest recorded threshold voltage of &#8722;0.80&#8197;V. The well&#8208;balanced combination of these potent electron donating and accepting units culminated in exceptional intramolecular charge transfer interactions and minimal band gap values (1.82&#8211;2.31&#8197;eV) for the molecules, as demonstrated by photophysical and electrochemical investigations. These factors, coupled with the thin&#8208;film morphological studies, corroborated the superior performance of the fabricated devices. A longer retention time of 2000s and an endurance of 100 cycles mark the substantial stability of the memory devices. Moreover, conversion from binary to ternary WORM memory was achieved by the effective tuning of the electronic properties of the D&#8722;A systems by various substituent moieties. Molecular simulation studies revealed that the resistive switching phenomenon arises from a synergistic interplay of charge transfer and charge trapping processes within these D&#8722;A systems.

         <title>Pegylated Phosphine Ligands in Iridium(I) Catalyzed Hydrogen Isotope Exchange Reactions in Aqueous Buffers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 48, August 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pegylated phosphine as water&#8208;soluble ligand in iridium(i) catalyzed hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) reactions. The new catalyst was studied in HIE reactions in buffers and protic solvents. We found that solvent and pH had a strong impact on the two occurring HIE processes.







Abstract
The synthesis of a water&#8208;soluble, phosphine&#8208;pegylated iridium(I) catalyst and its application in hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) reactions in buffer is reported. The longer polyethylene glycol side chains on the phosphine increased the water solubility independently from the pH. HIE reactions of polar substrates in protic solvents were studied. DFT calculations gave further insights into the catalytic processes. The scope and limitation of the pegylated catalyst was studied in HIE reactions of several complex compounds in borax buffer at pH&#8197;9 and the best conditions were applied in a tritium experiment with the drug telmisartan.

         <title>A Prebiotic Pathway to Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 48, August 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemical activation is the key in the prebiotic synthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide: NAD+ is obtained under prebiotic conditions by formation of nicotinamide riboside from ammonia, cyanoacetaldehyde, prop&#8208;2&#8208;ynal, glycol aldehyde and glyceraldehyde. Regioselective phosphorylation and use of light activated AMP yields NAD+ in a continuous formation process.







Abstract
Enzymes play a fundamental role in cellular metabolism. A wide range of enzymes require the presence of complementary coenzymes and cofactors to function properly. While coenzymes are believed to have been part of the last universal ancestor (LUCA) or have been present even earlier, the syntheses of crucial coenzymes like the redox&#8208;active coenzymes flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) remain challenging. Here, we present a pathway to NAD+ under prebiotic conditions starting with ammonia, cyanoacetaldehyde, prop&#8208;2&#8208;ynal and sugar&#8208;forming precursors, yielding in&#8197;situ the nicotinamide riboside. Regioselective phosphorylation and water stable light activated adenosine monophosphate derivatives allow for topographically and irradiation&#8208;controlled formation of NAD+. Our findings indicate that NAD+, a coenzyme vital to life, can be formed non&#8208;enzymatically from simple organic feedstock molecules via photocatalytic activation under prebiotically plausible early Earth conditions in a continuous process under aqueous conditions.

         <title>Synthesis of a Library of Terpenoid Alkaloid&#8211;Like Compounds Containing Medium&#8208;Sized Rings via Reconstruction of the Humulene Skeleton</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 48, August 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a library of terpenoid alkaloid&#8208;like compounds with diverse heteroatom&#8208;containing ring systems. Our strategy involves the introduction of a nitrogen atom into a humulene skeleton and subsequent ring reconstruction. A tartrate&#8208;resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) assay using a receptor activator of nuclear factor&#8208;&#954;B ligand (RANKL)&#8208;induced RAW264.7 cells allowed identifying a seed compound for bone&#8208;resorptive diseases.







Abstract
The construction of a chemical library based on natural products is a promising method for the synthesis of natural product&#8208;like compounds. In this study, we synthesized a terpenoid alkaloid&#8208;like compound library based on the humulene skeleton. Our strategy, which enables access to diverse ring systems such as 11&#8208;membered monocyclic, oxabicyclic, and medium&#8208;sized aza ring&#8208;containing scaffolds, involves the introduction of a nitrogen atom, an intermolecular C&#8722;O bond formation via Lewis acid&#8208;mediated epoxide&#8208;opening transannulation, and a ring&#8208;reconstruction strategy based on olefin metathesis. A cheminformatics analysis based on their structural and physicochemical properties revealed that the synthesized compounds have high three&#8208;dimensionality and high natural product likeness scores but with structural novelty. The usefulness of the terpenoid alkaloid&#8208;like compound library for drug discovery and the accessibility to structure&#8208;activity relationship studies were validated by performing an assay for osteoclast&#8208;specific tartrate&#8208;resistant acid phosphatase activity, resulting in the identification of a seed compound for bone&#8208;resorptive diseases such as osteoporosis.

         <title>Multi Stimuli Responsive Dual Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission and Photochromic Behavior of a Tetraphenyl Substituted Triphenylamine Derivative and its Application as Anti&#8208;counterfeiting Agent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 48, August 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twisted polyaromatic luminescent systems are well known for their AIE behavior and this AIE feature is exploited for a wide variety of applications. In this work, a new tetraphenyl substituted triphenylamine moiety is coupled with spiropyran and the final compound furnished both photochromism, acidochromism, and AIE behavior which was used to afford anti&#8208;counterfeiting ink for versatile response under different wavelength of light.







Abstract
A multi&#8208;stimuli responsive tetraphenyl substituted tripehnylamine&#8208;based aggregation induced emissive (AIE) material coupled with spiropyran was prepared. Owing to the presence of AIE and photochromic moiety, the molecule exhibits emissive aggregates, photochromism, and acidochromism. The multiple stimuli sensitive behavior of the molecule was explored for anti&#8208;counterfeiting behavior on TLC plate and commercial banknotes. The fluorogenic and photogenic response under UV and visible light established the potential of the candidate as a new generation encryption material.

         <title>Supramolecular Complexation&#8208;Enhanced CO2 Chemisorption in Amine&#8208;Derived Sorbents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 48, August 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular complexation approach was developed to improve the CO2 chemisorption performance of water&#8208;lean amine sorbents. Detailed characterizations and theoretical simulation revealed that the supramolecular complexation between the CO2&#8208;integrated products and crown ether could stabilize the carbamic acid products, leading to improved CO2 uptake capacity and diminished energy consumption in CO2 releasing.







Abstract
A supramolecular complexation approach is developed to improve the CO2 chemisorption performance of solvent&#8208;lean amine sorbents. Operando spectroscopy techniques reveal the formation of carbamic acid in the presence of a crown ether. The reaction pathway is confirmed by theoretical simulation, in which the crown ether acts as a proton acceptor and shuttle to drive the formation and stabilization of carbamic acid. Improved CO2 capacity and diminished energy consumption in sorbent regeneration are achieved.

Sugared DNA displaying up to four different glycosides in the major groove has been prepared by DNA polymerase catalyzed primer extension using four different carbohydrate&#8208;linked 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates.







Abstract
A portfolio of six modified 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) derivatives derived from 5&#8208;substituted pyrimidine or 7&#8208;substituted 7&#8208;deazapurine bearing different carbohydrate units (d&#8208;glucose, d&#8208;galactose, d&#8208;mannose, l&#8208;fucose, sialic acid and N&#8722;Ac&#8208;d&#8208;galactosamine) tethered through propargyl&#8208;glycoside linker was designed and synthesized via the Sonogashira reactions of halogenated dNTPs with the corresponding propargyl&#8208;glycosides. The nucleotides were found to be good substrates for DNA polymerases in enzymatic primer extension and PCR synthesis of modified and hypermodified DNA displaying up to four different sugars. Proof of concept binding study of sugar&#8208;modified oligonucleotides with concanavalin A showed positive effect of avidity and sugar units count.

Mannosylerythritol lipid (MEL) analogues exhibiting both selective cytotoxicity against human skin cancer cells and recovery effects on damaged skin cells are presented by K. Toshima, D. Takahashi, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202401319). R&#8208;Mannosylthreitol lipid (MTL)&#8208;A induces not only necrosis&#8208;like cell death against HSC&#8208;5 cells but also exhibits an efficient recovery effect on damaged skin cells, thus indicating that R&#8208;MTL&#8208;A has potential as a lead compound for new cosmeceuticals.

         <title>Aggregation Mechanisms and Molecular Structures of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; in Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 48, August 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amyloid protein aggregation proceeds through two distinct pathways. In one pathway, misfolded proteins undergo nucleation and elongation steps ultimately forming fibrillar aggregates in the bulk solution environment. Alternatively, protein aggregation can be initiated via LLPS and LSPT steps, which further promote amyloid fibrils formation.







Abstract
Amyloid plaques are a major pathological hallmark involved in Alzheimer's disease and consist of deposits of the amyloid&#8208;&#946; peptide (A&#946;). The aggregation process of A&#946; is highly complex, which leads to polymorphous aggregates with different structures. In addition to aberrant aggregation, A&#946; oligomers can undergo liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) and form dynamic condensates. It has been hypothesized that these amyloid liquid droplets affect and modulate amyloid fibril formation. In this review, we briefly introduce the relationship between stress granules and amyloid protein aggregation that is associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Then we highlight the regulatory role of LLPS in A&#946; aggregation and discuss the potential relationship between A&#946; phase transition and aggregation. Furthermore, we summarize the current structures of A&#946; oligomers and amyloid fibrils, which have been determined using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and cryo&#8208;electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;EM). The structural variations of A&#946; aggregates provide an explanation for the different levels of toxicity, shed light on the aggregation mechanism and may pave the way towards structure&#8208;based drug design for both clinical diagnosis and treatment.

     alt="Aggregation Mechanisms and Molecular Structures of Amyloid-&#946; in Alzheimer's Disease"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amyloid protein aggregation proceeds through two distinct pathways. In one pathway, misfolded proteins undergo nucleation and elongation steps ultimately forming fibrillar aggregates in the bulk solution environment. Alternatively, protein aggregation can be initiated via LLPS and LSPT steps, which further promote amyloid fibrils formation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amyloid plaques are a major pathological hallmark involved in Alzheimer's disease and consist of deposits of the amyloid-&#946; peptide (A&#946;). The aggregation process of A&#946; is highly complex, which leads to polymorphous aggregates with different structures. In addition to aberrant aggregation, A&#946; oligomers can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and form dynamic condensates. It has been hypothesized that these amyloid liquid droplets affect and modulate amyloid fibril formation. In this review, we briefly introduce the relationship between stress granules and amyloid protein aggregation that is associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Then we highlight the regulatory role of LLPS in A&#946; aggregation and discuss the potential relationship between A&#946; phase transition and aggregation. Furthermore, we summarize the current structures of A&#946; oligomers and amyloid fibrils, which have been determined using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The structural variations of A&#946; aggregates provide an explanation for the different levels of toxicity, shed light on the aggregation mechanism and may pave the way towards structure-based drug design for both clinical diagnosis and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Biomarker&#8208;driven therapy holds significant potential to improve patient outcomes and quality of life. In this review, we explore recent advancements in bioinspired artificial systems and their therapeutic applications, with a particular emphasis on the capabilities of these BAS modalities. We discuss their roles in enabling on&#8208;demand activation, targeted drug delivery, intelligent treatment, and precision cell therapy, highlighting how these technologies can lead to more effective and tailored healthcare solutions.







Abstract
Bioinspired molecular engineering strategies have emerged as powerful tools that significantly enhance the development of novel therapeutics, improving efficacy, specificity, and safety in disease treatment. Recent advancements have focused on identifying and utilizing disease&#8208;associated biomarkers to optimize drug activity and address challenges inherent in traditional therapeutics, such as frequent drug administrations, poor patient adherence, and increased risk of adverse effects. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the latest developments in bioinspired artificial systems (BAS) that use molecular engineering to tailor therapeutic responses to drugs in the presence of disease&#8208;specific biomarkers. We examine the transition from open&#8208;loop systems, which rely on external cues, to closed&#8208;loop feedback systems capable of autonomous self&#8208;regulation in response to disease&#8208;associated biomarkers. We detail various BAS modalities designed to achieve biomarker&#8208;driven therapy, including activatable prodrug molecules, smart drug delivery platforms, autonomous artificial cells, and synthetic receptor&#8208;based cell therapies, elucidating their operational principles and practical in&#8197;vivo applications. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and future perspectives in the advancement of BAS&#8208;enabled technology and envision that ongoing advancements toward more programmable and customizable BAS&#8208;based therapeutics will significantly enhance precision medicine.

         <title>Photomediated Hexafluoroisopropoxylation of Unactivated Aryl Halides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of fluoroalkoxy groups, such as trifluoromethoxy and 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethoxy groups, in pharmaceutical and agrochemical development has increased dramatically in recent years. However, hexafluoroisopropoxy groups have remained significantly underrepresented, presumably due to limited synthetic methods for accessing this substituent in good yields. Herein, we report a mild, photochemical nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) approach for the synthesis of hexafluoroisopropyl aryl ethers from unactivated and abundant aryl halides. Notably, aryl chloride and bromide functionality are efficiently engaged by this methodology in addition to the traditional aryl fluoride nucleofuge. This method provided access to a diverse array of hexafluoroisopropyl aryl ethers, including multiple examples of late&#8208;stage functionalization of active pharmaceutical ingredients. A simple flow system was adapted for 10x scale&#8208;up, maintaining good yield for the reaction. Initial mechanistic studies indicate single electron oxidation of the arene as a key step in product formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving Regioselectivity for Remote C&#8211;H Activation by Substructure Conformations: an Approach of Paralogous Cytochrome P450 Enzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For advanced synthetic intermediates or natural products with multiple unactivated and energetically similar C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds, controlling regioselectivity for the C&#8208;H activation is particularly challenging. The use of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) is a promising solution to the &#8216;regioelectivity&#8217; challenge in remote C&#8211;H activation. Notably, CYPs and organic catalysts share a fundamental principle: they strive to control the distance and geometry between the metal reaction center and the target C&#8208;H site. Most structural analyses of the regioselectivity of CYPs are limited to the active pocket, particularly when explaining why regioselectivity could be altered by enzyme engineering through mutagenesis. However, the substructures responsible for forming the active pocket in CYPs are well known to display complex dynamic changes and substrate&#8208;induced plasticity. In this context, we highlight a comparative study of the recently reported paralogous CYPs, IkaD and CftA, which achieve different regioselectivity towards the same substrate ikarugamycin by distinct substructure conformations. We propose that substructural conformation&#8208;controlled regioselectivity might also be present in CYPs of other natural product biosynthesis pathways, which should be considered when engineering CYPs for regioselective modifications.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have become important tools in modern synthetic chemistry due to their versatility as organocatalysts and ligands in organometallic complexes. Since their first isolation and characterization, NHCs have demonstrated significant utility in various catalytic processes, offering advantages such as strong &#963;&#8208;electron donation and the ability to stabilize reactive intermediates. However, beyond their well&#8208;documented roles in catalysis, the potential of NHCs as stoichiometric reagents and synthetic building blocks remains an underexplored yet promising area. This Mini&#8208;review aims to shed light on these lesser&#8208;known applications of NHCs and their N&#8208;heterocyclic precursors or derivatives in organic synthesis. Furthermore, we discuss how the unique electronic and steric properties of NHCs can be harnessed to develop new synthetic methodologies or construct interesting organic frameworks. By highlighting these emerging uses, we hope to encourage further research into the non&#8208;catalytic applications of NHCs, broadening their scope and impact in synthetic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Introduction of Molecular Complexity via the Cross&#8208;Coupling of Lithium 1,4&#8208;Dioxene with Aryl Bromides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthetic potential of substituted 1,4&#8208;dioxenes is well recognised, although the chemistry of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dioxenes is relatively unexplored. Their transition metal&#8208;catalysed synthesis has been limited to Stille&#8208;type cross&#8208;coupling chemistry, typically showing long reaction times, or proceeding at high reaction temperatures. Here we present a facile and general methodology for the cross&#8208;coupling of aryl bromides with lithium 1,4&#8208;dioxene, affording a range of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dioxenes in generally good yields. We highlight the synthetic applicability of this transformation at multigram scale, and demonstrate the versatility of the products by conversion of the dioxene units to various carbonyl&#8208;based functionalities. Additionally, we present a concise two&#8208;step synthesis of an arylated analogue to a known 1,4&#8208;dioxene&#8208;based antifungal agent.</dc:description>

The compounds dehydrate to Na3RE(BO3)2 upon heating in air to about 500 &#176;C. Na2[RE(BO3)(OH)2] (RE = Tb&#8211;Er) are photoluminescent under UV radiation. Their UV&#8208;Vis spectra show the typical absorptions associated with 4f&#8208;4f transitions and absorption edges in the UV (band gaps &#8805; 5.7 eV). The RE3+ cation is coordinated by seven oxygen atoms, which define a distorted pentagonal bipyramid. The bipyramids share trans&#8208;edges of their base forming infinite chains. Triangular (BO3)3&#8211; groups connect the chains into layers. The crystal structure of Na2[Ho(BO3)(OH)2] was investigated at various temperatures in the range 100 K &#8804; T &#8804; 320 K. Above 310(2) K, the compound crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Cmcm (&#946;&#8208;phase), below, it undergoes a displacive phase transition of second order resulting in a monoclinic structure in space group C2/c (&#945;&#8208;phase). The critical exponents derived from different structural parameters indicate a cooperative distortion of the borate layers, but a rather uncorrelated adaptation of the sodium cations to their local environment. The other compounds of the series also adopt the structure of the &#945;&#8208;phase at 296 K.</dc:description>

         <title>ZnH2P4N8: Case Study on Topochemical Imidonitridophosphate High&#8208;Pressure Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitridophosphates are subject of current research, as they have a broad spectrum of properties and potential applications, such as ion conductors or luminescent materials. Yet, the subclass of imidonitridophosphates has been studied less extensively. The primary reason is that the controlled N&#8211;H functionalization of nitridophosphates is not straight forward, making targeted synthesis more challenging. Inspired by the high&#8208;pressure (HP) post&#8208;synthetic modification of nitridophosphates, we present the topochemical HP deprotonation of phosphorus nitride imides using the high&#8208;pressure polymorph &#946;&#8208;PN(NH) as an example. Additional incorporation of Zn2+ results in the first quaternary transition metal imidonitridophosphate ZnH2P4N8. The crystal structure was elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD), energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDX), powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) and solid&#8208;state magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MAS NMR). In addition, the presence of H as part of an imide group was confirmed by IR spectroscopy. The potential of this defunctionalization approach for controlling the N&#8211;H content is demonstrated by the preparation of partially deprotonated intermediates ZnxH4&#8722;2xP4N8 (x&#160;&#8776;&#160; 0.5, 0.85). This topochemical high&#8208;pressure reaction represents a promising way to prepare, control and manipulate new imide&#8208;based materials without altering their overall anionic framework</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Natural&#8208;Product&#8208;Inspired ABCB1 Inhibitors Through Regioselective Tryptophan C3&#8208;Benzylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The emergence of drug resistance in cancer&#160;is a serious threat. Upregulation of&#160;ABC/P&#8208;gp&#160;transporters significantly contributes to this&#160;emergence.&#160;Despite&#160;30 years of efforts,&#160;the search for effective ABC/P&#8208;gp inhibitors with&#160;minimal&#160;toxicity to human cells, is&#160;still underway.&#160;Inspired by Nocardioazine A, a marine alkaloid that inhibits&#160;P&#8208;gp, we report a regioselective pathway to create&#160;indole&#8208;C3&#8208;benzyl cyclo&#8208;L&#8208;Trp&#8208;L&#8208;Trp DKPs. We have reported that&#160;exo&#8208;C3&#8208;N&#8208;Dbn&#173;&#8208;Trp2 (13) as a lead ABCB1 inhibitor that is more effective than Verapamil. C3N&#8208;Dbn&#8208;Trp2 restored chemotherapy sensitivity in drug&#8208;resistant human cancer cells and had no adverse effect on cell proliferation.&#160;Herein, we report several such&#160;C3&#8208;functionalized pyrroloindolines as ABCB1 inhibitors.&#160;Results arising from the molecular docking studies indicate that the interactions at the access tunnel between ABCB1 and the inhibitor result in a powerful predictor for the efficacy of the inhibitor. Based on fluorescence&#8208;based assays, we conclude that the most efficacious inhibitor is the p&#8208;cyano&#8208;derived exo&#8208;C3&#8208;N&#8208;Dbn&#173;&#8208;Trp2 (33a), closely followed by several analogues. We correlate that the predictions based on the inhibitor interactions at the access tunnel provide clues about the design of improved ABCB1 inhibitors. This work lays the foundation for the design of a new class of inhibitors from a&#160;cyclo&#8208;L&#8208;Trp&#8208;L&#8208;Trp DKP scaffold.</dc:description>

         <title>Columnar Organization of Nonalternant Fluorinated Dehydrobenzannulenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two new partially fluorinated dehydrobenzannulenes have been prepared by inter&#8208; and intramolecular oxidative homocoupling of diyne precursors. These systems contain fluorinated and nonfluorinated arene rings in a non&#8208;alternant arrangement. Both macrocycles are roughly planar and organize into extended columns in the solid state. The assembly of these columns is mediated by the combination of dispersion interactions, slipped [&#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;] stacking interactions of the perfluorinated rings with each other, and their association with the nonfluorinated rings in the molecules of the neighboring macrocycles. These results suggest that partial fluorination of dehydrobenzannulenes can serve as a versatile motif for their assembly into columnar superstructures.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The atomic precision of metal nanoclusters and variability of surface ligands pave the way for its rational design and functionalization, whereas the property strengthening in multiple ways has been long challenging. Herein, improved amphiphilicity, chirality, thermostability, and strong CPL (circularly polarized luminescence) properties have been accomplished by facile ligand exchange of [Au23(CHT)16]&#8208; with HCapt (HCHT and HCapt denote cyclohexanethiol and captopril). In addition, the obtained chiral [Au23(SR)16]&#8208; (short for [Au23(CHT)16&#8208;x(Capt)x]&#8208;) clusters show specific binding affinity to remote&#8208;diamines (such as arginine and single/double strand DNA), originating from the hydrogen bonding and Van der Walls interaction among the surface Capt ligands and the di&#8208;amine groups.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Electrolyte for Electrosynthesis: Scalable Anodically&#8208;Enabled One&#8208;Pot Sequence from Aldehyde to Isoxazol(in)es</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical transformations are considered a green alternative to classical redox chemistry as it eliminates the necessity for toxic and waste producing redox reagents. Typical electrochemical reactions require the addition of a so&#8208;called supporting electrolyte &#8208; a salt bridge &#8211; and other additives, such as hexafluorisopropanol, to enhance conductivity and reaction outcomes, respectively. However, this is often accompanied by an increase in the amount of produced waste. Here, we report an "in&#8208;situ electrolyte" concept for facile, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, additive&#8208;free one&#8208;pot electrochemical preparation of isoxazol(in)es, important scaffolds for biologically active natural and synthetic molecules, from the respective aldehydes. The protocol utilizes no halogenated solvents and no external oxidants, while salt side&#8208;products provide the ionic conductivity necessary for the electrosynthesis. The electrolysis is performed in an undivided cell, using the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrodes for the chlor&#8208;alkali industry dimensionally stable and scalable mixed metal oxide anode and platinized titanium anode of high durability. The cascade transformation comprises the condensation of aldehyde to oxime followed by its anodic oxidation and subsequent intra&#8208; and/or intermolecular [3+2] cycloadditions with an appropriate dipolarophile. Chemical yields up to 97%, and good Faradaic efficiency, scalability, and stability are observed for most substrates in a broad scope.</dc:description>

         <title>Assay for characterizing adsorption&#8208;properties of surfaces (APS)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Analytes, from sample preparation, until entering an analytical instrument, are prone to adsorb to surfaces, driven by the chemical properties of the surface and the liquids they are dissolved in. This problem can be addressed with internal standards when a single or few known analytes are quantified that are usually not available in omics. However, minimal to no loss of analytes is the aim. Here, we present a novel assay for qualifying and quantifying interactions responsible for adsorption of molecules to surfaces (APS) by using LC&#8208;MS/MS&#8208;based differential quantitative analysis. To reflect a broad range of chemical interactions with surfaces, a reference mixture of thousands of tryptic peptides, with known compositions was selected, representing a variety of different chemical characteristics. The assay was tested by investigating the adsorption properties of several different vials with different surface chemistries. A significant number of hydrophobic peptides adsorbed to conventional polypropylene vials. In contrast, only few peptides adsorbed to polypropylene vials, assigned as low&#8208;protein&#8208;binding. The highest number of peptides adsorbed to glass vials driven by electrostatic interactions. In summary, the new assay is suitable to characterize adsorption properties of different surfaces and to approximate the loss of analytes during sample preparation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A hitherto unknown modification of I2O5 was obtained from high&#8208;pressure/high&#8208;temperature syntheses in a Walker&#8208;type multianvil device at 8 GPa and 250 &#176;C.

The single&#8208;crystal structure data are accompanied by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction data at ambient and elevated temperatures. Furthermore, DFT calculations were carried out to investigate the phase transition between the ambient&#8208;pressure polymorph NP&#8208;I2O5 to the newly synthesized high&#8208;pressure phase.</dc:description>

         <title>What is the Origin of the Regioselective C3&#8208;Hydroxylation of L&#8208;Arg by the Nonheme Iron Enzyme Capreomycin C?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The nonheme iron dioxygenase capreomycin C (CmnC) hydroxylates a free L&#8208;arginine amino acid regio&#8208; and stereospe&#8208;cifically at the C3&#8208;position as part of the capreomycin antibiotics biosynthesis. Little is known on its structure, catalytic cycle and substrate specificity and, therefore, a comprehensive computational study was performed. A large QM cluster model of CmnC was created of 297 atoms and the mechanisms for C3&#8722;H, C4&#8722;H and C5&#8722;H hydroxylation and C3&#8722;C4 desaturation were investigated. All low&#8208;energy pathways correspond to radical reaction mechanisms with an initial hydrogen atom abstraction followed by OH rebound to form alcohol product complexes. The work is compared to alternative L&#8208;Arg hydroxylating nonheme iron dioxygenases and the differences in active site polarity are compared. We show that a tight hydrogen bonding network in the substrate binding pocket positions the substrate in an ideal orientation for C3&#8722;H activation, whereby the polar groups in the substrate binding pocket induce an electric field effect that guides the selectivity</dc:description>

         <title>Overriding Cage Effect in Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Photoactivation of Diaryliodonium Reagents: Synthesis of Chalcogenides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent times, diaryliodonium reagents (DAIRs) have witnessed a resurgence as arylating reagents, especially under photoinduced conditions. However, reactions proceeding through electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex formation with DAIRs are restricted to electron&#8208;rich reacting partners serving as donors due to the well&#8208;known cage effect. We discovered a practical and high&#8208;yielding visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced EDA platform to generate aryl radicals from the corresponding DAIRs and use them to synthesize key chalcogenides. In this process, an array of DAIRs and dichalcogenides react in the presence of 1,4 diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) as a cheap and readily available donor, furnishing a variety of di(hetero)aryl and aryl/alkyl chalcogenides in good yields. The method is scalable, features a broad scope with good yields, and operates under open&#8208;to&#8208;air conditions. The photoinduced chalcogenation technology is suitable for late&#8208;stage functionalizations and disulfide bioconjugations and facilitates access to biologically relevant thioesters, dithiocarbamates, sulfoximines, and sulfones. Moreover, the method applies to synthesizing diverse pharmaceuticals, such as vortioxetine, promazine, mequitazine, and dapsone, under amenable conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural and Electronic Factors Controlling the Efficiency and Rate of Intersystem Crossing to the Triplet State in Thiophene Polycyclic Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thiophene polycyclic derivatives are widely used in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, photovoltaics, and medicinal chemistry applications. Understanding the electronic and structural factors controlling their intersystem crossing rates is paramount for these applications to be successful. This study investigates the photophysical, electronic structure, and excited state dynamics of 1,2&#8208;benzodiphenylene sulfide, benzo[b]naphtho[1,2&#8208;d]thiophene, and benzo[b]naphtho[2,3&#8208;d]thiophene in polar aprotic and non&#8208;polar solvents. Steady&#8208;state absorption and emission spectroscopy, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, and DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations are employed.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Thiophene polycyclic derivatives are widely used in organic light-emitting diodes, photovoltaics, and medicinal chemistry applications. Understanding the electronic and structural factors controlling their intersystem crossing rates is paramount for these applications to be successful. This study investigates the photophysical, electronic structure, and excited state dynamics of 1,2-benzodiphenylene sulfide, benzo[b]naphtho[1,2-d]thiophene, and benzo[b]naphtho[2,3-d]thiophene in polar aprotic and non-polar solvents. Steady-state absorption and emission spectroscopy, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, and DFT and TD-DFT calculations are employed. Low fluorescence quantum yields of 1.2 to 2.7% are measured in acetonitrile and cyclohexene, evidencing that the primary relaxation pathways in these thiophene derivatives are nonradiative. Linear interpolation of internal coordinates calculations predict that an S-C bond elongation reaction coordinate facilitates the efficient intersystem crossing to the T1 state. Excitation of 1,2-benzodiphenylene sulfide and benzo[b]naphtho[1,2-d]thiophene at 350 nm or benzo[b]naphtho[2,3-d]thiophene at 365 nm, populates the lowest-energy 1&#960;&#960;* state, which relaxes to the 1&#960;&#960;* minimum in tens of picoseconds or intersystem crosses to the triplet manifold in ca. 500 ps to 1.1 ns depending on the position at which the benzene rings are added.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Metabolic Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy of Pancreatic and Colon Cancer Tumor&#8208;Xenografts with Parahydrogen Hyperpolarized 1&#8208;13C Pyruvate&#8208;d3</title>

1&#8208;13C&#8208;pyruvate&#8208;d3 hyperpolarized via parahydrogen can be used to study altered metabolism with MRI in pancreatic as well as colon cancer human tumor&#8208;xenografts.







Abstract
Parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization (PHIP) is an emerging technique to enhance the signal of stable isotope metabolic contrast agents for Magnetic Resonance (MR). The objective of this study is to continue establishing 1&#8208;13C&#8208;pyruvate&#8208;d3, signal&#8208;enhanced via PHIP, as a hyperpolarized contrast agent, obtained in seconds, to monitor metabolism in human cancer. Our focus was on human pancreatic and colon tumor xenografts. 1&#8208;13C&#8208;vinylpyruvate&#8208;d6 was hydrogenated using parahydrogen. Thereafter, the polarization of the protons was transferred to 13C. Following a workup procedure, the free hyperpolarized 1&#8208;13C&#8208;pyruvate&#8208;d3 was obtained in clean aqueous solution. After injection into animals bearing either pancreatic or colon cancer xenografts, slice&#8208;selective MR spectra were acquired and analyzed to determine rate constants of metabolic conversion into lactate and alanine. 1&#8208;13C&#8208;pyruvate&#8208;d3 proved to follow the increased metabolic rate to lactate and alanine in the tumor xenografts.

         <title>Elevating Oxygen Evolution using Iron Phthalocyanine Infused Vanillic acid Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The designing of transition metal based organic catalyst plays an important role in water oxidation to produce oxygen. The present work involves the fabrication of iron based phthalocyanine catalyst on Ni foam which exhibited higher oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with lower overpotential compared to standard IrO2&#8901; It emphasizes the role of bimetallic Fe and Ni catalyst in the enhancement of OER activity.







Abstract
Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the bottle neck step in water splitting reaction towards the realization of hydrogen based clean energy production and storage. Metal air batteries and polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) are the alternative green energy systems that utilise O2 and H2 in the production of continuous and high energy output without the utilization of carbon based fuels which are the major sources of pollution. Transition metal based N4 organics are explored extensively as oxygen electrocatalysts i.&#8201;e., OER and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts because of their ease of synthesis, tuneable properties, low cost and high performance with long term stability. Here, vanillic acid functionalized iron phthalocyanine (FeVAPc) was synthesised and characterised by various spectroscopic techniques. The novel FeVAPc exhibited good thermal stability and was coated on Ni foam for OER studies. The scanning electron microscopy images showed net&#8208;work like surface morphology and the X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated the presence of Fe in +3 oxidation state. The Ni/FeVAPc demonstrated excellent electrocatalytic activity for OER with overpotential of 312&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA.cm&#8722;2 current density in 1.0&#8197;M KOH electrolyte. The designed organic based catalyst exhibited lesser Tafel slope value which is nearer to the benchmark catalyst, IrO2. The proposed catalyst exhibited good stability as phthalocyanines are highly stable and do not undergo decomposition even in strong acidic and basic corrosive media. Integration of FeVAPc onto the Ni foam resulted in higher mass activity, lower charge transfer resistance, high active surface area leading to enhanced conductivity and activity. The fabricated Ni/FeVAPc is an appropriate cost&#8208;effective, efficient and stable catalyst for OER towards industrial applications.

         <title>Interdependent Dynamic Nitroaldol and Boronic Ester Reactions for Complex Dynamers of Different Topologies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Complex dynamic systems displaying interdependency between nitroaldol and boronic ester reactions have been demonstrated. Nitroalkane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diols, generated by the nitroaldol reaction, were susceptible to ester formation with different boronic acids in aprotic solvents, whereas hydrolysis of the esters occurred in the presence of water. The boronic ester formation led to significant stabilization of the nitroaldol adducts under basic conditions. The use of bifunctional building blocks was furthermore established, allowing for main chain nitroaldol&#8208;boronate dynamers as well as complex network dynamers with distinct topologies. The shape and rigidity of the resulting dynamers showed an apparent dependency on the configuration of the boronic acids.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Ln&#8208;Doped Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks with Rare&#8208;Earth&#8208;Characteristic Long Persistent Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tunable luminescence&#8208;assisted information storage and encryption holds increasing significance in today's society. A promising approach to incorporating the benefits of both organic long persistent luminescent (LPL) materials and rare&#8208;earth (RE) luminescence lies in utilizing organic host materials to sensitize RE luminescence, as well as hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) phosphorescence F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer to RE compound luminescence. This work introduces a one&#8208;pot, in situ pyrolytic condensation method, achieved through high&#8208;temperature melting calcination, to synthesize lanthanide ion&#8208;doped HOF materials. This method circumvents the drawback of molecular triplet energy annihilation, enabling the creation of organic LPL materials with RE characteristics. The HOF material serves as the host, exhibiting blue phosphorescence and cyan LPL. By fine&#8208;tuning the doping amount, the composite material U&#8208;Tb&#8208;100 achieves green LPL with a luminescent quantum yield of 56.4%, and an LPL duration of approximately 2&#8208;3 s, demonstrating tunable persistence. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, spectral analysis, and theoretical calculation unveil that U&#8208;Tb&#8208;100 exhibits exceptional quantum yield and long&#8208;lived luminescence primarily due to the efficient sensitization of U monomer to RE ions and the PRET process between U and RE complexes. This ingenious strategy not only expands the repertoire of HOF materials but also facilitates the design of multifunctional LPL materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Bismuth Nanoparticles and Single Iron&#160;Atoms on Carbon Derived from a Covalent Organic Framework Synergistically Catalyze the&#160;Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The utilization of catalysts comprising metal nanoparticle has been beneficial for enhancing the performance of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the unsatisfactory intrinsic activity of these catalysts still presents a significant challenge, limiting their overall effectiveness. This issue can be addressed by introducing single atoms, which can create a synergistic effect with the nanoparticles to catalyse and thereby improve performance. Nevertheless, the synergistic catalysis of nanoparticles and single atoms is still being explored. In this study, we fabricated a core&#8208;shell structured carbon framework with Fe single atoms and Bi nanoparticles through the pyrolysis of COF and MOF core&#8208;shell structures. Introducing Fe single atoms into ZIF&#8208;8, with Fe&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8 as the core and Bi&#8208;containing COF as the shell, resulted in higher ORR activity. The catalyst exhibited a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.867 V and a high current density of 6.68 mA cm&#8208;2 in 0.1 M KOH, which were comparable to those of Pt/C equivalent.&#160; This study provides new research concepts for exploring the application of single atoms and nanoparticles in catalytic oxygen reduction reactions through synergistic effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Urea Ligand&#8208;Promoted Chainwalking Heteroannulation for the Synthesis of 6&#8208; and 7&#8208;membered Azaheterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Typical approaches to heterocycle construction require significant changes in synthetic strategy even for a change as minor as increasing the ring size. The ability to access multiple heterocyclic scaffolds through a common synthetic approach, simply through trivial modification of one reaction component, would enable facile access to diverse libraries of structural analogues of core scaffolds. Here, we show that urea&#8208;derived ligands effectively promote Pd&#8208;mediated chainwalking processes to enable remote heteroannulation for the rapid construction of six&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered azaheterocycles under essentially identical reaction conditions. This method demonstrates good functional group tolerance and effectively engages sterically hindered substrates. In addition, this reaction is applicable to target&#8208;oriented synthesis, demonstrated through the formal synthesis of antimalarial alkaloid galipinine.</dc:description>

         <title>Osmapentalenofurans Constructed by Reacting Os&#8801;C1 of Osmapentalyne with Phenols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over the past decade, significant research efforts have focused on osmapentalyne, characterized by the more reactive Os&#8801;C7 (Carbon atoms numbered in a clockwise direction on the osmapentalyne skeleton), across areas encompassing electrophilic, nucleophilic, and addition reactions. Nevertheless, the reactivity of osmapentalyne featuring Os&#8801;C1 remains ripe for further exploration. In this investigation, we effectively synthesized a lineage of osmapentalenofurans through the nucleophilic reaction of osmapentalyne incorporating Os&#8801;C1 with phenols. These resulting complexes demonstrate near&#8208;infrared luminescence traits in both solid and liquid states. Particularly noteworthy is the osmapentalenofuran derived from tetraphenylethane (TPE) unit, which showcases remarkable aggregation&#8208;induced emission ( AIE) property in the aggregated state. These osmapentalenofurans are also able to further extend their range of reactions, including reactions with base and isonitrile. This study not only broadens the scope of applications for metal aromatics but also furnishes valuable insights into the realm of specialized functional materials.</dc:description>

A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced cascade reaction was developed for the one&#8208;pot synthesis of 6&#8208;hydroxyindoloquinazolinones using isatins (or isatins and isatoic anhydrides) and aliphatic carboxylic acids, without the need for any catalysts/oxidants/metals. This method is applicable to various aliphatic carboxylic acids, yielding 36 sterically diverse products in 33&#8211;96&#8201;% yields.

         <title>Electrostatic Surface Potentials and Chalcogen&#8208;Bonding Motifs of Substituted 2,1,3&#8208;Benzoselenadiazoles Probed via 77Se Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of substituents on the self&#8208;complementary chalcogen bonding of 2,1,3&#8208;benzoselenadiazoles is investigated through solid&#8208;state and computational methods. 77Se solid&#8208;state NMR is found to be a sensitive probe of molecular surface potentials and chalcogen bond motifs.







Abstract
Chalcogen bonds (ChB) are moderately strong, directional, and specific non&#8208;covalent interactions that have garnered substantial interest over the last decades. Specifically, the presence of two &#963;&#8208;holes offers great potential for crystal engineering, catalysis, biochemistry, and molecular sensing. However, ChB applications are currently hampered by a lack of methods to characterize and control chalcogen bonds. Here, we report on the influence of various substituents (halogens, cyano, and methyl groups) on the observed self&#8208;complementary ChB networks of 2,1,3&#8208;benzoselenadiazoles. From molecular electrostatic potential calculations, we show that the electrostatic surface potentials (ESP) of the &#963;&#8208;holes on selenium are largely influenced by the electron&#8208;withdrawing character of these substituents. Structural analyses via X&#8208;ray diffraction reveal a variety of ChB geometries and binding modes that are rationalized via the computed ESP maps, although the structure of 5,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,1,3&#8208;benzoselenadiazole also demonstrates the influence of steric interactions. 77Se solid&#8208;state magic&#8208;angle spinning NMR spectroscopy, in particular the analysis of the selenium chemical shift tensors, is found to be an effective probe able to characterize both structural and electrostatic features of these self&#8208;complementary ChB systems. We find a positive correlation between the value of the ESP maxima at the &#963;&#8208;holes and the experimentally measured 77Se isotropic chemical shift, while the skew of the chemical shift tensor is established as a metric which is reflective of the ChB binding motif.

&lt;p&gt;Chalcogen bonds (ChB) are moderately strong, directional, and specific non-covalent interactions that have garnered substantial interest over the last decades.

         <title>Photochemical Initiation and Reactions of Thiyl Radicals Studied with SH2&#8217; Radical Traps</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SH2&#8217;&#8208;based radical traps were used to probe the mechanisms of photochemical spirocyclisation of indole&#8208;ynones with thiols and a relate thiol&#8208;ene reaction. The observation of trapped initiator radicals by electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) was consistent with the proposed formation of an intramolecular electron donor&#8208;acceptor indole&#8208;ynone complex. Trends in MS intensity of trapped intermediate radicals were rationalised in terms of radical reactivity.







Abstract
A radical trapping method based on an SH2&#8217; homolytic substitution reaction was applied to study the mechanism of a photochemical spirocyclisation of indole&#8208;ynones in the presence of thiols. Starting material, products and a range of trapped radical intermediates were simultaneously detected in reaction mixtures by mass spectrometry (MS). The trapped intermediates included both initiating and main chain propagating radicals. These data made it possible to propose a self&#8208;initiation mechanism consistent with the originally postulated photoexcitation of an intramolecular electron donor&#8208;acceptor complex of the substrate. The effect of thiol structure on the MS peak intensity of the reaction components was rationalised in terms of the relative stability of the radical intermediates. The results were compared to a simpler related reaction, a photochemical thiol&#8208;ene addition where reagents, products and trapped intermediate radicals were also detected by MS. Relative MS peak intensities were again explained by a combination of electronic and steric effects on the stability of intermediate radicals. Overall, SH2&#8217; radical trapping was demonstrated to be a powerful experimental technique for providing mechanistic evidence on photochemical and other organic radical reactions.

         <title>Gas Delivery Relevant to Human Health using Porous Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gases are essential for various applications relevant to human health and medicine. This Perspective aims to review the use of porous materials for the delivery of medicinally relevant gases including hydrogen sulfide, xenon, oxygen, and various gases for organic synthesis and to highlight the advantages of these solid&#8208;state systems over traditional methods of gas storage and delivery.







Abstract
Gases are essential for various applications relevant to human health, including in medicine, biomedical imaging, and pharmaceutical synthesis. However, gases are significantly more challenging to safely handle than liquids and solids. Herein, we review the use of porous materials, such as metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), zeolites, and silicas, to adsorb medicinally relevant gases and facilitate their handling as solids. Specific topics include the use of MOFs and zeolites to deliver H2S for therapeutic applications, 129Xe for magnetic resonance imaging, O2 for the treatment of cancer and hypoxia, and various gases for use in organic synthesis. This Perspective aims to bring together the organic, inorganic, medicinal, and materials chemistry communities to inspire the design of next&#8208;generation porous materials for the storage and delivery of medicinally relevant gases.

         <title>Enhanced Photocatalytic Ozonation Using Modified TiO2 With Designed Nucleophilic and Electrophilic Sites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface hydroxyl groups greatly promote O3 adsorption due to the presence of nucleophilic O&#8208;sites and electrophilic H&#8208;sites. At the same time, the surface hydroxyl groups lead to the internal polarization of the surface&#8208;adsorbed O3 and enhanced separation of photogenerated charge carriers, both of which are beneficial to promote O3 activation and ROS formation. Therefore, TiO2&#8722;OH displays efficiently photocatalytic ozonation. Notably, TiO2&#8722;OH mineralization efficiency in pharmaceutical plant wastewater is as high as 97.6&#8201;% within 7&#8197;hours.







Abstract
Photocatalytic ozonation is considered to be a promising approach for the treatment of refractory organic pollutants, but the design of efficient catalyst remains a challenge. Surface modification provides a potential strategy to improve the activity of photocatalytic ozonation. In this work, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were first performed to check the interaction between O3 and TiO2&#8722;OH (surface hydroxylated TiO2) or TiO2&#8722;F (surface fluorinated TiO2), and the results suggest that TiO2&#8722;OH displays better O3 adsorption and activation than does TiO2&#8722;F, which is confirmed by experimental results. The surface hydroxyl groups greatly promote the O3 activation, which is beneficial for the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Importantly, TiO2&#8722;OH displays better performance towards pollutants (such as berberine hydrochloride) removal than does TiO2&#8722;F and most reported ozonation photocatalysts. The total organic carbon (TOC) removal efficiency reaches 84.4&#8201;% within two hours. This work highlights the effect of surface hydroxylation on photocatalytic ozonation and provides ideas for the design of efficient photocatalytic ozonation catalysts.

         <title>Design and Realization of Visual and Contact&#8208;Type Fast Charging Power Source</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different with the charging method of conventional batteries, charging is achieved by a Zn sheet contacting with a WO3 film moistened with water, resulting in a rapid discoloration of WO3, and the open&#8208;circuit voltage of the device is 0.7&#8197;V, which can be used to drive various electronics by series&#8208;parallel connection.







Abstract
Charging power supplies with both fast and visualization functions have a wide range of applications in the information and new energy industries. In this paper, the visualized and contact&#8208;type fast charging power supply based on WO3 film and Zn sheet is presented, and the prototype devices are fabricated. Different with the charging method of conventional batteries, charging is achieved by a Zn sheet contacting with a WO3 film moistened with water, resulting in a rapid discoloration of WO3. Theoretical investigation indicates that the interaction between Zn sheet and water molecules is the primary cause of the color change in the WO3 film. The WO3 film completes the colouring state within 10&#8197;s in the presence of Zn sheet and water, and the open&#8208;circuit voltage of the device is 0.7&#8197;V, which can be used to drive various electronics by series&#8208;parallel connection. This research introduces a novel method to induce colouring of WO3 films and proposes a fast charging mode different from traditional power sources. It provides valuable insights for the future development of fast charging in the field of electrical energy.

         <title>Elucidating Mechanism and Selectivity in Pyridine Functionalization Through Silylium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that a semi&#8208;enclosed &#8242;rigid&#8217; electronegative cavity in PADI&#8208;type anions creates a well&#8208;defined recognition site, facilitating interaction with positively charged silylium pyridine species. Due to the high electrophilicity and minimal steric demand at the C4&#8208;position of the pyridine substrate, the reaction predominantly produces a C4&#8208;regioselective product.







Abstract
The functionalization of aromatic N&#8208;heterocycles through silylium activation demonstrates exceptional selectivity and efficiency. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations unveil the detailed silylium catalysis mechanism and elucidate the origins of selectivity in this reaction. The phosphoramidimidate sulfonamide (PADI) precatalyst orchestrates of the catalytic cycle via three elementary steps. The Br&#248;nsted acidity of precatalyst significantly influences both the formation of silylium&#8208;based Lewis acid active species and the silylium activation of pyridine. Unlike disulfonimide (DSI)&#8208;type precatalysts, both Tf2NH and PADI precatalysts with strong acidities can easily promote the generation of activated silylium pyridine species. A semi&#8208;enclosed &#8242;rigid&#8217; electronegative cavity in PADI&#8208;type anions constructs a well&#8208;defined recognition site, facilitating engagement with the positively charged silylium pyridine species. Due to the high electrophilicity and less steric demand at the C4&#8208;position of the pyridine substrate, the product with C4&#8208;regioselectivity was predominantly generated.

         <title>Radical C&#8208;Glycosylation Using Photoexcitable Unprotected Glycosyl Borate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed radical C&#8208;glycosylation using photoexcitable unprotected glycosyl borate. The direct excitation of glycosyl borate under visible light irradiation enabled the generation of anomeric radical without any photoredox catalysts. The in&#8197;situ generated anomeric radical was applicable to the radical addition such as Giese&#8208;type addition and Minisci&#8208;type reaction to introduce alkyl and heteroaryl groups at the anomeric position. In addition, the radical&#8211;radical coupling between the glycosyl borate and acyl imidazolide provided unprotected acyl C&#8208;glycoside.

         <title>Novel Benzothiadiazole&#8208;based Donor&#8208;Acceptor Systems: Synthesis, Ultrafast Charge Transfer and Separation Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new series of benzothiadiazole&#8208;based donor&#8208;acceptor chromophores with multiple donor/acceptor entities of variable electronic strengths has been designed, synthesized, and unveiled their explicit photo&#8208;electro&#8208;chemical responses for the first time. Facile intramolecular charge transfer, subsequent charge separation, and broad absorption expand their horizons in advanced optical and photonic applications.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorbing electron donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) chromophores have been at the forefront of current energy research owing to their facile charge transfer (CT) characteristics, which are primitive for photovoltaic applications. Herein, we have designed and developed a new set of benzothiadiazole (BTD)&#8208;based tetracyanobutadiene (TCBD)/dicyanoquinodimethane (DCNQ)&#8208;embedded multimodular D&#8722;A systems (BTD1&#8208;BTD6) and investigated their inherent photo&#8208;electro&#8208;chemical responses for the first time having identical and mixed terminal donors of variable donicity. Apart from poor luminescence, the appearance of broad low&#8208;lying optical transitions extendable even in the NIR region (&gt;1000&#8197;nm), particularly in the presence of the auxiliary acceptors, are indicative of underlying nonradiative excited state processes leading to robust intramolecular CT and subsequent charge separation (CS) processes in these D&#8722;A constructs. While electrochemical studies identify the moieties involved in these photo&#8208;events, orbital delocalization and consequent evidence for the low&#8208;energy CT transitions have been achieved from theoretical calculations. Finally, the spectral and temporal responses of different photoproducts are obtained from femtosecond transient absorption studies, which, coupled with spectroelectrochemical data, identify broad NIR signals as CS states of the compounds. All the systems are found to be susceptible to ultrafast (~ps) CT and CS before carrier recombination to the ground state, which is, however, significantly facilitated after incorporation of the secondary TCBD/DCNQ acceptors, leading to faster and thus efficient CT processes, particularly in polar solvents. These findings, including facile CT/CS and broad and intense panchromatic absorption over a wide window of the electromagnetic spectrum, are likely to expand the horizons of BTD&#8208;based multimodular CT systems to revolutionize the realm of solar energy conversion and associated photonic applications.

         <title>A Facile Approach to Construct Novel Polyesters as Soft Midblock for Thermoplastic Elastomers</title>

         <dc:description>
A facile synthetic strategy was developed to prepare a class of CL&#8208;based monomers (R&#8208;TO) with a variety of functionalities and well&#8208;defined stereochemistry by exploit of epoxides, which readily polymerize via well&#8208;controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) to afford a series of amorphous polyesters P(R&#8208;TO). Sequential addition copolymerization of MTO and L&#8208;lactide (L&#8208;LA) allowed to access of a series of ABA triblock copolymers with composition&#8208;dependent mechanical properties.







Abstract
The development of innovative synthetic strategies to create functional polycaprolactones is highly demanded for advanced material applications. In this contribution, we reported a facile synthetic strategy to prepare a class of CL&#8208;based monomers (R&#8208;TO) derived from epoxides. They readily polymerize via well&#8208;controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) to afford a series of polyesters P(R&#8208;TO) with high molecular weight (Mn up to 350&#8197;kDa). Sequential addition copolymerization of MTO and L&#8208;lactide (L&#8208;LA) allowed to access of a series of ABA triblock copolymers with composition&#8208;dependent mechanical properties. Notably, P(L&#8208;LA)100&#8208;b&#8208;P(MTO)500&#8208;b&#8208;P(L&#8208;LA)100 containing the amorphous P(MTO) segment as a soft midblock and crystalline P(L&#8208;LA) domain as hard end block behaved as an excellent thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) with high elongation at break (1438&#177;204&#8201;%), tensile strength (23.5&#177;1.7&#8197;MPa), and outstanding elastic recovery (&gt;88&#8201;%).

         <title>Lead Bromide Complex in Tri&#8208;n&#8208;Octylphosphine Oxide Matrix with Bright Photoluminance and Exceptional Thermoplasticity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal halide materials, known for their opto&#8208;electronic properties and structural diversity, face challenges due to rigidity, making them brittle and difficult to shape. We introduce a thermoplastic hybrid lead halide solid, formed by integrating lead bromide complex into a TOPO matrix. This enables near&#8208;room&#8208;temperature melt&#8208;processing, offering potential for self&#8208;healing fluorescent inks.







Abstract
Metal halide materials have recently drawn increasing research interest for their excellent opto&#8208;electronic properties and structural diversity, but their resulting rigid structures render them brittle and poor formability during manufacturing. Here we demonstrate a thermoplastic luminant hybrid lead halide solid by integrating lead bromide complex into tri&#8208;n&#8208;octylphosphine oxide (TOPO) matrix. The construction of the hybrid materials can be achieved by a simple dissolution process, in which TOPO molecules act as the solvents and ligands to yield the monodispersed clusters. The combination of these functional units enables the near&#8208;room&#8208;temperature melt&#8208;processing of the materials into targeted geometry by simple molding or printing techniques, which offer possibilities for fluorescent writing inks with outstanding self&#8208;healing capacity to physical damage. The intermarriage between metal halide clusters with functional molecules expands the range of practical applications for hybrid metal halide materials.

         <title>Intramolecular Nucleophilic Vinylic Substitution (SNV) by Carbon Nucleophiles: Conformationally Directed Formation of Dienes from N,N&#8217;&#8208;Diallyl Ureas</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diallyl ureas, on treatment with base, undergo a cascade of reversible deprotonations and alkene isomerisations that culminate in an intramolecular SNV reaction that links the two allylic substituents together to form a diene.







Abstract
Nucleophilic vinylic substitution (SNV) by carbon nucleophiles allows the formation of vinylic C&#8722;C bonds without transition metal catalysts. In this paper, we show that tethering two alkenes together through a urea linkage can lead to the formation of a diene by an intramolecular SNV reaction. The starting materials are fully substituted N,N&#8217;&#8208;diallyl ureas; the reaction proceeds in the presence of base, and entails a cascade of deprotonations, reprotonations, and an SNV reaction of an allylic carbanion on a rare electrophile: a vinylic urea. As a result, two allylic substituents couple to form a diene, despite the fact that neither is activated towards electrophilic attack. The reaction is tolerant of significant steric bulk, and exhibits regioselectivity with unsymmetrical diallyl ureas: &#946;&#8208;substituted allyl groups invariably behave as nucleophiles, while electrophilic behavior may be enforced by the use of an E&#8208;vinylic urea substituent that cannot be deprotonated under the reaction conditions.

In this paper, we show that tethering two alkenes together through a urea linkage can lead to the formation of a diene by an intramolecular S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;V reaction. The starting materials are fully substituted &lt;i&gt;N,N&#8217;&lt;/i&gt;-diallyl ureas; the reaction proceeds in the presence of base, and entails a cascade of deprotonations, reprotonations, and an S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;V reaction of an allylic carbanion on a rare electrophile: a vinylic urea. As a result, two allylic substituents couple to form a diene, despite the fact that neither is activated towards electrophilic attack. The reaction is tolerant of significant steric bulk, and exhibits regioselectivity with unsymmetrical diallyl ureas: &#946;-substituted allyl groups invariably behave as nucleophiles, while electrophilic behavior may be enforced by the use of an &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;-vinylic urea substituent that cannot be deprotonated under the reaction conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis, Structures, and Properties for PIII&#8208;Doped Hetero&#8208;Buckybowls and Their Phosphonium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Doping polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with heteroatoms enables manipulation of their electronic structures. Herein, the structures and properties of phosphorus (P) doped heterosumanenes (HSEs) are regulated by varying the valence states of P&#8208;dopant. The phosphine sulfide (PV) and chalcogens (S, Se, Te) co&#8208;doped HSEs (1&#8211;3) are reduced to&#160;trivalent phosphorus (PIII) doped analogues 4&#8211;6. Then, the PIII&#8208;dopants on 4&#8211;6 are converted to phosphonium salts (R4P+), giving 7&#8211;9. The valence states of P&#8208;dopant show great influence on molecular geometries and electronic structures. Taking P and S co&#8208;doped HSEs as example, bowl&#8208;depths increase in the order of 1 (PV) &lt; 7 (R4P+) &lt; 4 (PIII), and the HOMO energy levels and HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps increase to be 7 &lt; 1 &lt; 4. Consistent with the theoretical calculation, the first oxidation potentials decrease and the absorption/emission bands show blue shift from 7 to 1 to 4. The transformation of PV to PIII leads to large variations on the coordination with Ag+, owing to the alteration of coordination site from P=S to PIII. The phosphonium salts show ring&#8208;opening of phosphole rings under electrochemical reduction. It is found that chalcogen atoms play pivotal roles on coordination patterns of coordination complexes and the conversion rates of ring&#8208;opening reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>The Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Continuum in the Salt/Cocrystal Systems of Quinoline and Chloro&#8208;Nitrobenzoic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study investigates the hydrogen&#8208;bond geometry in six two&#8208;component solid systems composed of quinoline and chloro&#8208;nitrobenzoic acids. New X&#8208;ray diffraction studies were conducted using both the conventional independent&#8208;atom model and the more recent Hirshfeld atom&#8208;refinement method, with the latter providing precise hydrogen&#8208;atom positions. The systems can be divided into salts (the hydrogen atom transferred to the quinoline nitrogen), cocrystals (the hydrogen atom retained by the acid), and intermediate structures. Solid&#8208;state NMR experiments corroborated the X&#8208;ray diffraction&#8208;derived H&#8211;N distances. DFT calculations, using five functionals including hybrid B3LYP and PBE0, showed varying energy profiles for the hydrogen bonds, with notable differences across functionals. These calculations revealed different preferences for salt or cocrystal structures, depending on the functional used. Path&#8208;integral molecular dynamics simulations incorporating nuclear quantum effects demonstrated significant hydrogen&#8208;atom delocalization, forming a hydrogen&#8208;bond continuum, and provided average N&#8211;H distances in excellent agreement with experimental results. This comprehensive experimental and theoretical approach highlights the complexity of multicomponent solids. The study emphasizes that the classification into salts or cocrystals is frequently inadequate, as the hydrogen atom is often significantly delocalized in the hydrogen bond. This insight is crucial for understanding and predicting the behavior of such systems in pharmaceutical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Photodynamic Therapy for Neurodegenerative Diseases: Development of Azobenzene&#8208;Spiropyran@Gold Nanoparticles for Controlled Singlet Oxygen Generation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of durable photosensitizers is pivotal for advancing phototherapeutic applications in biomedicine. Here, we introduce a core&#8208;shell azobenzene&#8208;spiropyran structure on gold nanoparticles, engineered to enhance singlet oxygen generation. These nano&#8208;photosensitizers exhibit increased structural stability and thermal resistance, as demonstrated by slowed O&#8208;N&#8208;C bond recombination dynamics via in&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy. Notably, the in&#8208;situ formation of merocyanine and a light&#8208;induced compact shell arrangement extend its half&#8208;life from 47 minutes to over 154 hours, significantly boosting singlet oxygen output. The nano&#8208;photosensitizer also shows high biocompatibility and notably inhibits tau protein aggregation in neural cells, even with phosphatase inhibitors. Further, it promotes dendritic growth in neuro cells, doubling typical lengths. This work not only advances chemical nanotechnology but also sets a foundation for developing long&#8208;lasting phototherapy agents for treating neurodegenerative diseases</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How to select a few cells from a culture and modify them with a probe? Triphenylamine&#8208;sensitized 8&#8208;DMAQ (TAQ) probes showed internalization in HeLa cells that could be consecutively activated either by using UV light source (357&#8197;nm) or, under two&#8208;photon irradiation conditions (760&#8197;nm). Activation allowed to efficient release of the reporter into cells in light&#8208;exposed regions.







Abstract
Triphenylamine&#8208;sensitized 8&#8208;dimethylaminoquinoline (TAQ) probes showed fair two&#8208;photon absorption and fragmentation cross sections in releasing kainate and GABA ligands. The water&#8208;soluble PEG and TEG&#8208;analogs allowed cell internalization and efficient light&#8208;gated liberation of the rhodamine reporter under UV and two&#8208;photon (NIR) irradiation conditions.

         <title>Dimers and 2D Networks of Adamantane&#8208;Related Ternary Organosilicon Coinage Metal Sulfide Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions of the organosilicon sulfide cluster [(PhSi)4S6] with [AgCl(PMe2Ph)2]2 or mixtures of MCl (M=Cu or Ag) and a phosphine ligand in CH2Cl2 caused its disassembly and reorganization under incorporation of metal phosphine moieties to form [(Ph3P)3Ag(&#956;&#8208;S)SiCl2Ph], [(PhSiClS2CH2)2(&#956;&#8208;dppb)], [{(dppbCu2)Cu(&#956;&#8211;dppb)0.5(PhSi)3S6}2], and [Na2(thf)1.5][(Me2PhPAg)(PhSi)3S6]. The latter two represent ternary M&#8722;S&#8722;Si&#8208;based clusters with complex crystal structures and wideband semiconductor&#8208;like optical gaps.







Abstract
Adamantane&#8208;type organotin sulfide clusters were recently shown to react with coinage metal phosphine complexes under replacement of an organic substituent by a metal&#8208;phosphine unit. An extension of such studies involving the silicon&#8208;based congener [(PhSi)4S6] (A) revealed that the cluster core will be partly disassembled and a {PhSi} moiety is replaced by a coinage metal phosphine complex to form [(Et3PAg)3(PhSi)3S6] (B) and [Na2(thf)2.33][(Me3PCu)(PhSi)3S6] (C). Herein, we present an extension of this work upon variation of the reactants and reaction conditions. Besides the isolation of crystalline precursor complexes [CuCl(PMe2Ph)3] (1) and [AgCl(PMe2Ph)2]2 (2), the study addresses reactions of A with AgCl and a phosphine ligand in CH2Cl2, upon which A is completely disassembled to form [(Ph3P)3Ag(&#956;&#8208;S)SiCl2Ph] (3). In another case a CH2 group, most likely stemming from CH2Cl2, was attached to the ligand, thus generating [{PhCl(S)SiSCH2P(Ph2)CH2CH2}2] (4). Upon using CuCl and 1,4&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)butane (dppb) we isolated the phosphine&#8208;bridged analog of B, [{(dppbCu2)CuP(Ph2)(CH2CH2)(PhSi)3S6}2] (5). In order to receive the yet elusive silver homolog of C, we used PMe2Ph as a bulkier ligand. This way we generated a 2D coordination polymer of the desired composition, [Na2(thf)1.5][(Me2PhPAg)(PhSi)3S6] (6). UV&#8208;visible spectra of 6 indicated a bandgap of 3.89&#8197;eV, thus blue&#8208;shifted in regards to B and C.

&lt;p&gt;Reactions of the organosilicon sulfide cluster [(PhSi)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] with [AgCl(PMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ph)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or mixtures of MCl (M=Cu or Ag) and a phosphine ligand in CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; caused its disassembly and reorganization under incorporation of metal phosphine moieties to form [(Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ag(&#956;-S)SiCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ph], [(PhSiClS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;-dppb)], [{(dppbCu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)Cu(&#956;&#8211;dppb)&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;(PhSi)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;], and [Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(thf)&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt;][(Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PhPAg)(PhSi)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]. The latter two represent ternary M&#8722;S&#8722;Si-based clusters with complex crystal structures and wideband semiconductor-like optical gaps.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adamantane-type organotin sulfide clusters were recently shown to react with coinage metal phosphine complexes under replacement of an organic substituent by a metal-phosphine unit. An extension of such studies involving the silicon-based congener [(PhSi)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;) revealed that the cluster core will be partly disassembled and a {PhSi} moiety is replaced by a coinage metal phosphine complex to form [(Et&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PAg)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(PhSi)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;) and [Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(thf)&lt;sub&gt;2.33&lt;/sub&gt;][(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PCu)(PhSi)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;). Herein, we present an extension of this work upon variation of the reactants and reaction conditions. Besides the isolation of crystalline precursor complexes [CuCl(PMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ph)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) and [AgCl(PMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ph)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), the study addresses reactions of &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt; with AgCl and a phosphine ligand in CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, upon which &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt; is completely disassembled to form [(Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ag(&#956;-S)SiCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ph] (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;). In another case a CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group, most likely stemming from CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, was attached to the ligand, thus generating [{PhCl(S)SiSCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P(Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;). Upon using CuCl and 1,4-bis(diphenylphosphino)butane (dppb) we isolated the phosphine-bridged analog of &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;, [{(dppbCu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)CuP(Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(PhSi)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;). In order to receive the yet elusive silver homolog of &lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;, we used PMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ph as a bulkier ligand.

         <title>Selective Oxidation of Vitamin D3 Enhanced by Long&#8208;Range Effects of a Substrate Channel Mutation in Cytochrome P450BM3 (CYP102A1)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;range effects from mutation of a substrate access tunnel residue selected by docking&#8208;guided design of cytochrome P450BM3 (CYP102A1) to loosen the interaction between two secondary structure elements reshaped the substrate binding pocket and increased the activity for the oxidation vitamin D3 to 25&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;vitamin D3, an important human and animal health supplement.







Abstract
Vitamin D deficiency affects nearly half the population, with many requiring or opting for supplements with vitamin D3 (VD3), the precursor of vitamin D (1&#945;,25&#8208;dihydroxyVD3). 25&#8208;HydroxyVD3, the circulating form of vitamin D, is a more effective supplement than VD3 but its synthesis is complex. We report here the engineering of cytochrome P450BM3 (CYP102A1) for the selective oxidation of VD3 to 25&#8208;hydroxyVD3. Long&#8208;range effects of the substrate&#8208;channel mutation Glu435Ile promoted binding of the VD3 side chain close to the heme, enhancing VD3 oxidation activity that reached 6.62&#8197;g of 25&#8208;hydroxyVD3 isolated from a 1&#8208;litre scale reaction (69.1&#8201;% yield; space&#8208;time&#8208;yield 331&#8197;mg/L/h).

         <title>Realizing Color Transitions for Three Copper (I) Cluster Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Materials by Adjusting Reaction Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three isomeric copper iodide cluster hybrid materials 1&#8211;3 were achieved by adjusting the reaction conditions. The crystal color transit from green, yellow to orange with high QYs at 57&#8201;%~88&#8201;%. All three complexes have good thermal stability, good solution processability, and high quantum yield. This study can provide development of cuprous iodide cluster luminescent materials.







Abstract
Copper iodide organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials have been favored by many researchers in the field of solid&#8208;state lighting (SSL) due to their structural diversity and optical adjustability. In this paper, three isomeric copper iodide cluster hybrid materials, Cu4I6(L)2(1), Cu5I4.5Cl2.5(L)2(2) and Cu5I7(L)2) (3) (L=1&#8208;(4&#8208;methylpyrimidin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octan&#8208;1&#8208;ium), were achieved by adjusting the reaction conditions. The crystal color transit from green, yellow to orange and the internal quantum yield (IQY) increase from 57&#8201;%&#8211;88&#8201;%. All three complexes have good thermal stability, good solution processability, and high quantum yield. And origin and mechanism of luminescence of complexes were further studied. This study can provide ideas and theoretical basis for the regulation of cuprous iodide cluster luminescent materials.

         <title>High Rotational Barrier Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented class of atropisomers based on Ugi reaction that exhibit exceptional rotational barrier is reported. The versatility of our approach enables the synthesis of atropisomers &#8220;by design&#8221; and allow the conceptualization of this work in atroposelective synthesis and high&#8208;sensitivity modular balances. Single&#8208;crystal structures, combined by DFT calculations and dynamic NMR allow us to examine a plethora of &#960;&#8208;interactions.







Abstract
Atropisomers have attracted a great deal of attention lately due to their numerous applications in organic synthesis and to their employment in drug discovery. However, the synthetic arsenal at our disposal with which to access them remains limited. The research described herein is two&#8208;pronged; we both demonstrate the use of MCR chemistry as a synthetic strategy for the de novo synthesis of a class of atropisomers having high barriers to rotation with the simultaneous insertion of multiple chiral elements and we study these unprecedented molecular systems by employing a combination of crystallography, NMR and DFT calculations. By fully exploiting the synthetic capabilities of our chemistry, we have been able to monitor a range of different types of interaction, i.&#8201;e. &#960;&#8208;&#960;, CH&#8211;&#960;, heteroatom&#8208;&#960; and CD&#8211;&#960;, in order to conduct structure&#8208;property studies. The results could be applied both to atroposelective synthesis and in drug discovery.

         <title>Dynamic Structural Fluxionality in a Planar Tetracoordinate Carbon Cluster Stabilized by Boron Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported a molecular compasses CB2H5+ with a planar tetracoordinate carbon (ptC) atom, two ligand hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon rotate alternately. This is the first global minimum for boron&#8208;coordinated ptC clusters with dynamic fluxionality.







Abstract
The design of boron&#8208;based molecular rotors stems from boron&#8208;carbon binary clusters containing multiple planar hypercoordinate carbons (phCs, such as C2B8).

&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; with a planar tetracoordinate carbon (ptC) atom, two ligand hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon rotate alternately. This is the first global minimum for boron-coordinated ptC clusters with dynamic fluxionality.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design of boron-based molecular rotors stems from boron-carbon binary clusters containing multiple planar hypercoordinate carbons (phCs, such as C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;). However, the design of boron-coordinated phCs is challenging due to boron's tendency to occupy hypercoordinate centers more than carbon.

         <title>CoCorrole&#8208;Functionalized PCN&#8208;222 for Carbon Monoxide Selective Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have combined the carbon monoxide chemisorption properties of cobalt corroles with the high porosity and stability of the PCN&#8208;222 MOFs. High performance materials for the selective and reversible adsorption of CO vs O2, N2 and CO2 at low pressure have been obtained.







Abstract
The high risk of CO poisoning justifies the need for indoor air quality control and warning systems based on the detection of low concentrations (ppm&#8208;ppb) of CO. Cobalt corrole complexes selectively bind CO vs. O2, CO2, N2, opening new fields of applications. By combining the CO chemisorption properties of cobalt corroles with the known sorption capacity of MOFs, we hope to obtain high performance sensing materials for CO detection. In addition, the exposed metal sites of MOFs lead to CO2 physisorption, allowing the co&#8208;detection of CO and CO2. In this work, PCN&#8208;222, a stable Zr&#8208;based MOF made from Ni(TCPP) with natural vacancies, has been used as a porous matrix for the grafting of electron&#8208;poor metallocorroles. The materials were characterized by powder XRD, SEM and optical microscopy, BET analyses and gas adsorption measurements at 298&#8197;K. No degradation of the crystalline structure of PCN&#8208;222 was observed. At 1&#8197;atm, the adsorbed CO(g) volumes measured for the best materials were 12.15&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 14.01&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 for CoCorr2@PCN&#8208;222 and CoCorr3@PCN&#8208;222 respectively, and both materials exhibited high CO chemisorption and selectivity against O2, N2, and CO2 at low pressure due to the highest energy of the chemisorption process vs physisorption.

         <title>Anions as Lewis Acids in Noncovalent Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#963; or &#960;&#8208;hole within a Lewis acid usually signals a positive electrostatic potential that can attract the negative region of an approaching nucleophile. Because of their overall negative charge, any such hole on an anion will typically indicate a negative potential. Nonetheless, it is shown here that a wide range of anions are able to act as Lewis acid in a noncovalent bond, despite a negatively charged &#963; or &#960;&#8208;hole. These bonds are constituted in large part by an attractive electrostatic interaction, even though negative regions of the two subunits face one another.







Abstract
The ability of an anion to serve as electron&#8208;accepting Lewis acid in a noncovalent bond is assessed via DFT calculations. NH3 is taken as the common base, and is paired with a host of ACln&#8722; anions, with central atom A=Ca, Sr, Mg, Te, Sb, Hg, Zn, Ag, Ga, Ti, Sn, I, and B. Each anion reacts through its &#963; or &#960;&#8208;hole although the electrostatic potential of this hole is quite negative in most cases. Despite the contact between this negative hole and the negative region of the approaching nucleophile, the electrostatic component of the interaction energy of each bond is highly favorable, and accounts for more than half of the total attractive energy. The double negative charge of dianions precludes a stable complex with NH3.

         <title>Copper(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Amination of Aryl Chlorides in Aqueous Ammonia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anilines are ubiquitous in bio&#8208;active compounds and their synthesis can be achieved via metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions involving aryl halides. We describe an unusual, yet simple, CuII&#8208;catalyzed system for the amination of aryl chlorides in pure aqueous ammonia with 2.5 mol% catalyst loading under non&#8208;inert conditions. Different from previous systems, the reaction proceeds even without an additional organic solvent. Copper(II) sulfate in combination with 4,7&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline enabled the amination of several aryl chlorides containing electron&#8208;neutral, &#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing groups to the corresponding anilines with good to excellent yields. The upscaling potential of the procedure has been shown by the synthesis at 50 mmol scale. The reaction proceeds as one of the rare cases of a CuII&#8208;assisted coupling, in contrast to the typical CuI&#8213;CuIII intermediates postulated for most Ullmann&#8208;type coupling reactions. The copper(II) center allows for a nucleophilic substitution pathway, enabled by the deprotonation of coordinated ammonia.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in Electrolytes for Magnesium Batteries: Bridging the Gap Between Chemistry and Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) have the potential to provide a sustainable and long&#8208;term solution for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to high theoretical capacity of magnesium (Mg) metal as an anode, its competitive redox potential (Mg/Mg2+: &#8208;2.37 V vs. SHE) and high natural abundance. To develop viable magnesium batteries with high energy density, the electrolytes must meet a range of requirements: high ionic conductivity, wide electrochemical potential window, chemical compatibility with electrode materials and other battery components, favourable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfacial properties and cost&#8208;effective synthesis. In recent years, significant progress in electrolyte development has been made. Herein, a comprehensive overview of these advancements is presented. Beginning with the early developments, we particularly focus on the chemical aspects of the electrolytes and their correlations with electrochemical properties. We also highlight the design of new anions for practical electrolytes, the use of electrolyte additives to optimize anode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces and the progress in polymer electrolytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Glycerol as Reaction Medium for Sonogashira Couplings: A Green Approach for the Synthesis of New Triarylamine&#8208;Based Materials with Potential Application in Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study focuses on the design, eco&#8208;friendly synthesis, and characterization of several novel three&#8208;legged triphenylamine derivatives. By performing Sonogashira couplings of functionalized aryl iodides with tris(4&#8208;ethynylphenyl)amine in glycerol, a readily available bio&#8208;derived solvent, we achieved the synthesis of target products in short times and high yields, up to 94%, with consistently lower E&#8208;factors and reduced costs compared to standard conditions using toluene as the reaction medium. The target molecules possess a D&#8208;(&#960;&#8208;A)&#8323; or D&#8208;(&#960;&#8208;D)&#8323; structure, where an electron&#8208;donating core connects to three electron&#8208;donating (D) or electron&#8208;accepting (A) peripheral aromatic subunits through an acetylene spacer.

By performing Sonogashira couplings of functionalized aryl iodides with tris(4-ethynylphenyl)amine in glycerol, a readily available bio-derived solvent, we achieved the synthesis of target products in short times and high yields, up to 94%, with consistently lower E-factors and reduced costs compared to standard conditions using toluene as the reaction medium. The target molecules possess a D-(&#960;-A)&#8323; or D-(&#960;-D)&#8323; structure, where an electron-donating core connects to three electron-donating (D) or electron-accepting (A) peripheral aromatic subunits through an acetylene spacer. Their main optical and electronic properties have been determined experimentally and by DFT simulations and suggest a possible implementation in energy conversion technologies such as luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) and perovskite solar cells (PSCs).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Two&#8208;step Intermolecular Interaction of Molecular Macroions with&#160;Multivalent Counterions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macroion&#8208;counterion interaction is essential for regulating the solution behaviors of hydrophilic macroions, as simple models for polyelectrolytes. Here, we explore the interaction between uranyl peroxide molecular cluster Li68K12(OH)20[UO2(O2)OH]60 (U60) and multivalent counterions. Different from interaction with monovalent counterions that shows a simple one&#8208;step process, isothermal titration calorimetry, combined with light/X&#8208;ray scattering measurements and electron microscopy, confirm a two&#8208;step process for their interaction with multivalent counterions: an ion&#8208;pairing between U60 and the counterion with partial breakage of hydration shells followed by strong U60&#8208;U60 attraction, leading to the formation of large nanosheets with severe breakage and reconstruction of hydration shells. The detailed studies on macroion&#8208;counterion interaction can be nicely correlated to the microscopic (self&#8208;assembly) and macroscopic (gelation or phase separation) phase transitions in the dilute U60 aqueous solutions induced by multivalent counterions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The reaction of hydrazinium sulfate and chlorosulfonic acid in pyridine leads to the pyridinium salt of the hydrazine disulfonate anion, [(SO3)HNNH(SO3)]2&#8722;. The salt is the starting material for the preparation of further hydrazine disulfonates, for example of alkaline metals and barium. In all compounds, the [(SO3)HNNH(SO3)]2&#8722; anion adopts the gauche conformation. The conformer is chiral but all of the investigated compounds crystallize as racemates.

         <title>COMPUTATIONAL DESIGN OF 3D LANTERN ORGANIC FRAMEWORK</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study employed a computational approach, particularly Density Functional Theory at B3LYP&#8208;D3/6&#8208;31+G(d) level to design two new classes of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) Lantern Organic Frameworks (LOFs) materials based on trisilasumanene and porphyrin core building units. Particularly, we detail strategies for transitioning from 1DLOF nanowires to extended 3D structures: first by connecting planar&#8208;molecule base units of trisilasumanene or porphyrin using benzene&#8208;based linkers, and then connecting silicon anchoring atoms on the bases with other bases that are vertically stacked by sp3&#8208;hydrocarbon chains. The 3D&#8208;LOF structures are designed to have different pore sizes through the use of various bases, bridges, and linkers. Comparisons of electronic properties of these 3D structures lead to one designing rule. That is, the gap between highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the 3D materials depends only on its base and is nearly independent of the stack size or the length of the sp3&#8208;hydrocarbon bridges. Additionally, connecting base units with linkers also extends &#960;&#8208;electron conjugation system leading to a reduction in HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap. For instance, linking two trisilasumanene molecules significantly narrows HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap by 1.75 eV while stacking these bases vertically and connecting them by linear pentane&#8208;based bridges yield insignificant change to the gap.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Silylcyclopentenes via Ball Milling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and environmentally friendly method for synthesizing silylcyclopentenes has been developed using Ar2SiH2, Li metal, and butadiene with the ball milling technique. Additionally, DFT calculations suggest that this transformation involves a nucleophilic addition of mechanochemically generated Si&#8722;Li intermediates with butadiene to form corresponding carbon anion species, which then completes the [4+1] cycloaddition process through nucleophilic substitution with Si&#8722;H.







Abstract
The development of innovative methods for synthesizing silylcyclopentene compounds is particularly important for enriching and improving the synthetical toolbox of organosilicon compounds. Herein, a facile approach has been developed for the synthesis of silylcyclopentenes promoted by mechanochemically generated organolithium species as silicon nucleophiles under ball milling conditions, avoiding the requirement of large amounts of bulk solvent. This operationally simple method demonstrates good functional group compatibility, which provides a great opportunity for further exploration of the synthetic applications of silylcyclopentenes. Density functional theory calculations indicated that the transient lithiosilole intermediates undergo a stepwise nucleophilic addition process, which governs this mechanic&#8208;force&#8208;promoted [4+1] cycloaddition reaction.

         <title>Superlong Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanowire Fabricated via Steam&#8208;Assisted Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile steam&#8208;assisted conversion is developed to fabricate superlong 1D Cu metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanowire through recrystallization mechanism. As&#8208;prepared 1D Cu MOF nanowire possesses identical crystal structure of MOF&#8208;74 and multiscale porous structure, which can effectively remove cationic dyes and is an ideal template to form Cu nanoparticle&#8208;doped carbon nanofiber with excellent electrocatalytic activity for glucose detection.







Abstract
1D nanomaterials have attracted great attention due to their outstanding anisotropic and linear structures. A facile method is developed to fabricate 1D copper metal&#8211;organic framework nanowires (Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;NW) through steam&#8208;assisted conversion from Cu&#8208;MOF precursors. During the steam&#8208;assisted conversion, Cu&#8208;MOF precursor gradually dissolves in methanol steam, and then recrystallized into Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;NW, which shows high aspect ratio of about 600 and identical crystal structure of MOF&#8208;74. As&#8208;prepared Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;NW with multiscale porous structure can effectively remove cationic dyes even in dye mixture. Moreover, Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;NW, as an ideal template, is calcined to form Cu nanoparticle&#8208;doped carbon nanofiber with maintaining its 1D morphology, which shows excellent electrocatalytic activity for the non&#8208;enzymatic sensing of glucose.

Moreover, Cu-MOF-NW, as an ideal template, is calcined to form Cu nanoparticle-doped carbon nanofiber with maintaining its 1D morphology, which shows excellent electrocatalytic activity for the non-enzymatic sensing of glucose.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design of an Acidic pH&#8208;Activated NIR Fluorescent Convertible Rhodamine&#8722;Hemicyanine Probe&#8208;Peptide Conjugate for Living Cancer Cell Active Targeted Selective Tracking of Lysosomes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A closed and an open state switchable rhodamine&#8208;hemicyanine probe&#8208;peptide conjugate is presented. Acidic pH&#8208;activated NIR fluorescent convertible probe&#8208;peptide conjugate can be used for live cancer cell active targeted selective tracking and ratiometric imaging of lysosomes.







Abstract
We have synthesized an acidic pH&#8208;activatable dual targeting ratiometric fluorescent probe&#8208;peptide conjugate using the SPPS protocol on Rink amide AM resin. Living carcinoma cell specific active targeting, successive cell penetration, and selective staining of lysosomes are accomplished. Real&#8208;time monitoring of lysosomes, 3D, and multicolor cancer cell imaging are also attained. The de novo design consists of the integration of multifunctionality into a single molecular scaffold, e.&#8201;g., RGDS peptide residue to target cancer cell surface overexpressed receptor &#945;V&#946;3 integrin, live&#8208;cell penetrating organic unsymmetrical rhodamine&#8208;hemicyanine chromophore comprising a lysosome targeting morpholine group, and an acidic pH openable spiro&#8208;lactam ring for a visible&#8208;to&#8208;NIR switchable ratiometric response. Water&#8208;soluble fluorescent probe&#8208;peptide conjugate exhibits intramolecular spirolactamization at basic pH through Arg amide N. The visible spirolactam state predominantly exists at physiological and basic pH and can be switched to the highly conjugated NIR open amide state (&#955;em=735&#8197;nm) through spiro&#8208;lactam ring opening triggered by acidic pH with a huge bathochromic shift (&#916;&#955;abs=336&#8197;nm, &#916;&#955;FL=265&#8197;nm). Moreover, pH&#8208;sensitive ratiometric optical switching is achieved. This in&#8197;situ acidic cancer cell lysosome activatable multifunctional fluorophore&#8208;peptide conjugate shows augmented molar absorptivity, enhanced quantum yield, and improved fluorescence lifetime at acidic lysosomal pH; negligible cytotoxicity; and dual targeted ratiometric imaging capability of living cancer cell selective lysosomes with a pKa value of 5.1.

         <title>Pre&#8208;Coordination Induced Further Deamination to Create Inter&#8208;Chain Cross&#8208;Linking in Carbon Nitride for Enhanced Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A KCl&#8208;guided, pre&#8208;coordination&#8208;induced further deamination strategy has been developed to create cross&#8208;linking between different chains of polymeric carbon nitride (PCN). This sufficient pre&#8208;coordination endows the resulting CNK&#8208;2 with a relatively high degree of cross&#8208;linking, which promotes efficient inter&#8208;chain charge transport. Consequently, the obtained CNK&#8208;2 exhibits significantly enhanced photocatalytic H&#8322;O&#8322; production.







Abstract
Creating cross&#8208;linking to establish efficient inter&#8208;chain charge&#8208;transfer channels in carbon nitride represents a promising strategy for enhancing its photocatalytic capabilities. Molten salt&#8208;assisted calcining has emerged as a method for preparing cross&#8208;linked carbon nitrides. However, the precise influence of molten salts on the molecular structure of carbon nitride remains to be fully elucidated. Herein, we develop a KCl guided cross&#8208;linking reaction to preliminarily reveal the formation mechanism of cross&#8208;linking. The cross&#8208;linking reaction is initiated by the pre&#8208;coordination of amino groups with K+. Subsequent heating at high temperature converts the amino groups into chlorines. Then, dechlorination leads to the formation of cross&#8208;linking. Thus, this cross&#8208;linking reaction can be accurately described as a pre&#8208;coordination&#8208;induced, two&#8208;step deamination reaction. The pre&#8208;coordination step plays a pivotal role in the cross&#8208;linking process. Sufficient pre&#8208;coordination results in a relatively high cross&#8208;linking degree of the as&#8208;prepared CNK&#8208;2. Consequently, CNK&#8208;2 demonstrates a significantly enhanced photocatalytic H2O2 production, with a generation rate of 682&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, about 59 times that of traditional carbon nitride.

         <title>Visible Light Promoted Site&#8208;Specific Functionalization of &#945;&#8208;Acyloxy Carboxamides: Unlocking a Forbidden Chemical Space in the Passerini Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel method is presented, demonstrating the facile generation of &#945;&#8208;acyloxy carboxamide radicals via photoredox catalysis of Passerini adducts, obtained employing a 4&#8208;formyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydropyridine. These radicals efficiently undergo Giese reactions with various olefins, yielding novel Passerini compounds unattainable through traditional aldehyde&#8208;based routes.







Abstract
The facile generation of the &#945;&#8208;acyloxy carboxamide radical is hereby reported for the first time, utilizing a photoredox catalyzed reaction of Passerini adducts synthesized using a 4&#8208;formyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydropyridine as the carbonyl component. This radical effectively engages in a Giese reaction with a range of olefins, ultimately leading to the synthesis of novel Passerini&#8208;derived products not previously amenable to direct aldehyde&#8208;based transformations. Consequently, the resulting strategy, developed both in batch and in flow, offers a promising opportunity to expand the chemical space accessible through the Passerini reaction, virtually incorporating &#8220;impossible&#8221; aldehydes.

         <title>Targeted Endoperoxides Delivering Singlet Oxygen to Cancer Cell Mitochondria: Exploration of the Therapeutic Potential</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled and targeted generation of singlet oxygen in tumor tissues is poised to evolve into a viable therapeutic approach for cancer which does not require light or oxygen.







Abstract
The clinical practice of photodynamic therapy of cancer (PDT) is mostly limited to superficial types of cancer. The major reason behind this limited applicability is the need for light in the photogeneration of ROS, and in particular singlet oxygen. In order to circumvent this major roadblock, we designed and synthesized naphthalene&#8208;derived endoperoxides with mitochondria targeting triphenylphosphonium moieties. Here, we show that these compounds release singlet oxygen by thermal cycloreversion, and initiate cell death with IC50&lt;10&#8197;&#956;M in cancer cell cultures. The mouse 4T1 breast tumor model study, where the endoperoxide compound was introduced intraperitoneally, also showed highly promising results, with negligible systemic toxicity. Targeted delivery of singlet oxygen to cancer cell mitochondria could be the breakthrough needed to transform Photodynamic Therapy into a broadly applicable methodology for cancer treatment by keeping the central tenet and discarding problematic dependencies on oxygen or external light.

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Corannulene Flanked N&#8208;heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) Precursors and Preparation of Their Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the mechanosynthesis of novel corannulene&#8208;flanked imidazolium bromide NHC precursors. The proposed approach is benchmarked against conventional solution&#8208;based methods using green metrics and energy consumption parameters, showcasing ball&#8208;milling as a greener and more energy&#8208;efficient technique. In addition, the new compounds are demonstrated to be robust ligands for transition metals using ligand substitution reactions as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept.







Abstract
The synthesis of new compounds is an important pillar for the advancement of the field of chemistry and adjacent fields. In this regard, over the last decades huge efforts have been made to not only develop new molecular entities but also more efficient sustainable synthetic methodologies due to the increasing concerns over environmental sustainability. In this context, we have developed synthetic routes to novel corannulene flanked imidazolium bromide NHC precursors both in the solid&#8208;state and solution phases. Our work presents a comprehensive comparative study of mechanochemical routes and conventional solution&#8208;based methods. Green metrics and energy consumption comparison were performed for both routes revealing ball&#8208;milling generation of these compounds to be an environmentally greener technique to produce such precursors compared to conventional solvent&#8208;based methods.

&lt;p&gt;This study presents the mechanosynthesis of novel corannulene-flanked imidazolium bromide NHC precursors. The proposed approach is benchmarked against conventional solution-based methods using green metrics and energy consumption parameters, showcasing ball-milling as a greener and more energy-efficient technique. In addition, the new compounds are demonstrated to be robust ligands for transition metals using ligand substitution reactions as proof-of-concept.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of new compounds is an important pillar for the advancement of the field of chemistry and adjacent fields. In this regard, over the last decades huge efforts have been made to not only develop new molecular entities but also more efficient sustainable synthetic methodologies due to the increasing concerns over environmental sustainability. In this context, we have developed synthetic routes to novel corannulene flanked imidazolium bromide NHC precursors both in the solid-state and solution phases. Our work presents a comprehensive comparative study of mechanochemical routes and conventional solution-based methods. Green metrics and energy consumption comparison were performed for both routes revealing ball-milling generation of these compounds to be an environmentally greener technique to produce such precursors compared to conventional solvent-based methods. In addition, we have demonstrated proof-of-concept of the herein reported corannulene flanked NHCs to be robust ligands for transition metals and their ligand substitution reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mesoionic Janus&#8208;Type Dicarbene: Complexes, Adducts, and Catalytic Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition metal and main group adducts of the first mesoionic Janus&#8208;type N&#8208;heterocyclic dicarbene (diNHC) are thoroughly described in terms of their preparations, characterizations, and electronic properties. In addition, a preliminary catalytic study of its dipalladium complex in the sequential C2&#8208; and C5&#8208;arylation of 1&#8208;methylpyrrole affording non&#8208;symmetrical 2,5&#8208;diarylpyrroles is included.







Abstract
The preparations of homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;bimetallic complexes as well as thiourea and selenourea derivatives of a mesoionic Janus&#8208;type N&#8208;heterocyclic dicarbene (diNHC) are reported. Analogues of its monocationic intermediate NHC have also been obtained for comparison. Using the main group adducts, the &#960;&#8208;acceptor properties of both NHCs were determined using low temperature 77Se NMR spectroscopy completing their stereoelectronic profiling. Moreover, catalytic investigations reveal that the mesoionic dipalladium Janus&#8208;diNHC complex can be used in the sequential C2&#8208; and C5&#8208;arylation of 1&#8208;methylpyrrole for the preparation of non&#8208;symmetrical 2,5&#8208;diarylpyrroles.

         <title>Wittig Reaction in Deep Eutectic Solvents: Expanding the DES Toolbox in Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wittig reaction was performed in Deep Eutectic Solvents with high yields, wide scope, facile TPPO (triphenyl phosphine oxide) removal and scalability of the process.







Abstract
Wittig reaction between substituted phosphonium salts and (hetero)aromatic and alkyl carbonyl compounds in Deep Eutectic Solvents has been developed under a scalable and friendly protocol. Highly efficient reactions were successfully run with a wide range of bases including organic (DBU, LiTMP, t&#8208;BuOK) and inorganic (NaOH, K2CO3) ones in ChCl/Gly 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 (mol/mol) as solvent under mild conditions, at room temperature and under air. The proposed protocol was applied to a wide range of substrates, including (hetero)aromatic aldehydes with substituents as halogens (I, Br, Cl), EDG (alkoxy, methyl), EWG (NO2, CF3) or reactive groups as CN, esters, and ketones. Vinylic, alkynyl and cycloalkyl, alicyclic and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes can also be used. Highly electrophilic ketones gave good yields. The diastereoselectivity of the reaction is in complete agreement with the E/Z ratio predictable under traditional conditions. We demonstrated that the protocol is scalable to 2&#8197;g (5&#8197;mmol) of phosphonium salt, furthermore the proposed workup protocol allows to remove TPPO without need of additional chromatographic purification.

         <title>Monomeric Fe(III)&#8208;Hydroxo and Fe(III)&#8208;Aqua Complexes Display Oxidative Asynchronous Hydrogen Atom Abstraction Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper presents the lipoxygenase&#8208;like activity of monomeric [FeIII(L5R)(OH)]1+ and [FeIII(L5R)(OH2)]2+ complexes (R=OMe, H, Cl, NO2), employing linoleic acid as a substrate. The rate&#8208;limiting step involves hydrogen atom transfer from linoleic acid to the &#8220;FeIII&#8722;OH&#8220;/&#8221;FeIII&#8722;OH2&#8220; complexes via an oxidative asynchronous concerted proton&#8208;electron transfer (CPET) pathway. The higher degree of asynchronicity in CPET within aqua complexes enhances the rate by approximately five&#8208;fold compared to hydroxo analogs.







Abstract
This paper presents the synthesis and characterization of a series of novel monomeric aqua&#8208;ligated iron(III) complexes, [FeIII(L5R)(OH2)]2+ (R=OMe, H, Cl, NO2), supported by an amide&#8208;containing pentadentate N5 donor ligand, L5R [HL5R=2&#8208;(((1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methyl)(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#8208;methyl)amino)&#8208;N&#8208;(5&#8208;R&#8208;quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)acetamide]. The complexes were characterized by various spectroscopic and analytical techniques, including electrochemistry and magnetic measurements. The Fe(III)&#8208;hydroxo complexes, [FeIII(L5R)(OH)]1+, were generated in&#8197;situ by deprotonating the corresponding aqua complexes in a pH ~7 aqueous medium. In another way, adding one equivalent of a base to a methanolic solution of the Fe(III)&#8208;aqua complexes also produced the Fe(III)&#8208;hydroxo complexes. The study uses linoleic fatty acid as a substrate to explore the hydrogen atom abstraction (HAA) reactivity of both hydroxo and aqua complexes. The investigation highlights the substitution effect of the L5R ligand on reactivity, revealing a higher rate when an electron&#8208;withdrawing group is present. Hammett analyses and(or) determination of the asynchronicity factor (&#951;) suggest an oxidative asynchronous concerted proton&#8208;electron transfer (CPET) pathway for the HAA reactions. Aqua complexes exhibited a higher asynchronicity in CPET, resulting in higher reaction rates than their hydroxo analogs. Overall, the work provides insights into the beneficial role of a higher imbalance in electron&#8208;transfer&#8208;proton&#8208;transfer (ET&#8208;PT) contributions in HAA reactivity.

         <title>Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Based Ion&#8208;Pair Recognition for Encapsulation of a Stilbazolium&#8208;Type Dye with Enhanced Photophysical Properties and Nonlinear Optical Activity</title>

         <dc:description>
A pillar[5]arene is used as an ion&#8208;pair receptor for the modulation of both the crystalline&#8208;state packing and photophysical properties of a dye guest. The host&#8722;guest complex cocrystals formed from this pillar[5]arene receptor and the dye guest not only show enhanced solid&#8208;state photoluminescence quantum yields compared to dye crystals, but also possess second harmonic generation activity.







Abstract
Constructing organic composite materials through molecular recognition has emerged as an important theme in materials science. Here we report an ion&#8208;pair recognition system involving the use of a propoxylated pillar[5]arene (PrP5) to modulate the solid&#8208;state photophysical properties of dye trans&#8208;4&#8217;&#8208;(dimethylamino)&#8208;N&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;stilbazolium hexafluorophosphate (DMASP). Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis reveals that the dye guest DMASP is encapsulated by PrP5 to form a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8722;guest complex 2PrP5&#11815;DMASP in the crystalline state. The macrocyclic skeleton of PrP5 imposes restrictions on the intramolecular motions of the dye guest, leading to a significant enhancement of its fluorescence emission. Additionally, within the 2PrP5&#11815;DMASP complex crystal structure, DMASP molecules are found to display two possible opposite orientations in the one&#8208;dimensional channels formed by PrP5 molecules. This arrangement is believed to alter the overall solid&#8208;state packing structure of DMASP, thereby activating its nonlinear optical activity. This work not only reports a novel ion&#8208;pair molecular recognition system based on pillararenes but also provides valuable insights into the modulation of the crystalline state photophysical properties of organic dyes via cocrystal engineering.

This arrangement is believed to alter the overall solid-state packing structure of &lt;b&gt;DMASP&lt;/b&gt;, thereby activating its nonlinear optical activity. This work not only reports a novel ion-pair molecular recognition system based on pillararenes but also provides valuable insights into the modulation of the crystalline state photophysical properties of organic dyes via cocrystal engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Influence of Disulfide, Thioacetal and Lanthionine&#8208;Bridges on the Conformation of a Macrocyclic Peptide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Does the bridge matter? We have compared the solution conformations of lanthionine, disulfide and thioacetal&#8208;bridged cyclic analogues of angiotensin(1&#8211;7). Despite the different bridging structures, the major conformations are found to be conserved for the macrocyclic core.







Abstract
Cyclisation of peptides by forming thioether (lanthionine), disulfide (cystine) or methylene thioacetal bridges between side chains is established as an important tool to stabilise a given structure, enhance metabolic stability and optimise both potency and selectivity. However, a systematic comparative study of the effects of differing bridging modalities on peptide conformation has not previously been carried out. In this paper, we have used the NMR deconvolution algorithm, NAMFIS, to determine the conformational ensembles, in aqueous solution, of three cyclic analogues of angiotensin(1&#8211;7), incorporating either disulfide, or non&#8208;reducible thioether or methylene thioacetal bridges. We demonstrate that the major solution conformations are conserved between the different bridged peptides, but the distribution of conformations differs appreciably. This suggests that subtle differences in ring size and bridging structure can be exploited to fine&#8208;tune the conformational properties of cyclic peptides, which may modulate their bioactivities.

Abstract
Complex oxides Eu2MeO6 (Me&#8211;Mo, W), Eu2W2O9 were obtained by a solid&#8208;phase reaction between binary oxides. The thermodynamic and kinetic mechanisms of the reaction processes were established using a variety of physical&#8208;chemical methods. All compounds obtained in this work crystallize in the low&#8208;symmetry monoclinic system, forming complex framework structures, which determine a set of very valuable physical&#8208;chemical properties. Comparison of experimental Kubelka&#8208;Munk functions and DFT&#8208; calculated absorption spectra shows adequate agreement and reveals the origin of the fundamental absorption. In addition, the deficiency in DFT calculations in the part of mutual contribution of CTBs of Mo&#8722;O and W&#8722;O, from one side, and Eu&#8722;O contributions, from the other side, is reported. Calculations of absorption spectra are shown to be superior to band structure analysis in the determination of optical band gaps. Additionally, luminescent properties of Eu2MeO6 and Eu2W2O9 compounds were investigated. These studies provide a better understanding of the electronic and optical properties of the compounds Eu2MeO6 and Eu2W2O9, along with their potential applications in various areas.

Abstract
We described a copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed atom economic and selective hydroamination&#8208;cyclization of alkynyl&#8208;tethered quinazolinones to prepare a variety of indole&#8208;fused pyrazino[1,2&#8208;a]quinazolinones in good to excellent yields ranging from 39&#8201;%&#8211;99&#8201;% under mild reaction conditions. Control experiments revealed that coordination&#8208;directed method of quinazolinone moiety with copper(I) was important for the selective hydroamination&#8208;cyclization of alkynes at the N1&#8208;atom instead of N3&#8208;atom of quinazolinone. The reaction could be easily performed at gram scales and some prepared indole&#8208;fused pyrazino[1,2&#8208;a]quinazolinones with donating groups on the indole moiety showed a distinct fluorescence emission wavelength with blue shift under the acid conditions.

         <title>Excited&#8208;State Dynamics in Segregated Donor&#8208;Acceptor Stacks Versus a Peri&#8208;Bisdonor&#8208;Acceptor System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Delocalized excitation in the segregated stacks of the naphthalenemonoimide&#8208;perylene based donor&#8208;acceptor system (NI&#8208;Pe) is reported. In the monomer of the fork&#8208;shaped bisdonor&#8208;acceptor system (NI&#8208;Pe2) with intrinsic close&#8208;stacked perylene donors, a long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated (CS) state is observed in non&#8208;polar solvents. The CS state involves a delocalized perylene dimer radical cation engendered by the peri&#8208;perylene interactions in NI&#8208;Pe2.







Abstract
The investigation of impact of through&#8208;space/through&#8208;bond electronic interaction among chromophores on photoexcited&#8208;state properties has immense potential owing to the distinct emergent photophysical pathways. Herein, the photoexcited&#8208;state dynamics of homo&#8208;sorted &#960;&#8208;stacked aggregates of a naphthalenemonoimide and perylene&#8208;based acceptor&#8208;donor (NI&#8208;Pe) system and a fork&#8208;shaped acceptor&#8208;bisdonor (NI&#8208;Pe2) system possessing integrally stacked peri&#8208;substituted donors was examined. Femtosecond transient absorption (fsTA) spectra of NI&#8208;Pe monomer recorded in chloroform displayed spectroscopic signatures of the singlet state of Pe; 1Pe*, the charge&#8208;separated state; NI&#8722;&#8901;&#8208;Pe+&#8901;, and the triplet state of Pe; 3Pe*. The examination of ultrafast excited&#8208;state processes of NI&#8208;Pe aggregate in chloroform revealed faster charge recombination (

         <title>Photoinduced Transition&#8208;Metal and External Photosensitizer Free Benzylic Fluorination of Unactivated Alkylarenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photocatalytic monofluorination of unactivated alkylarenes, potentially initiated via a single&#8208;electron transfer, offers a highly efficient and selective pathway with excellent substrate compatibility, enabling the scale&#8208;up synthesis of pharmaceutical molecules. Omitting transition&#8208;metal catalysts and photosensitizers simplifies late&#8208;stage drug modification and the purification process.







Abstract
A green and efficient protocol for the direct monofluorination of unactivated alkylarenes under visible&#8208;light irradiation has been developed, without any extraneous transition&#8208;metal catalysts or photosensitizers. This method is compatible with a broad spectrum of functional groups, including carboxylic and alcoholic scaffolds, under mild reaction conditions. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis of a fluorine&#8208;containing pharmaceutical analogue was successfully executed, underscoring the strategy's reliability and practicality. Furthermore, mechanistic studies suggest that a single&#8208;electron transfer mechanism might be responsible for the generation of the benzylic radicals in initiation step.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Catalytic Metal&#8208;Based Homogeneous&#8208;Heterogeneous Systems in Organic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this concept article we provide examples where metal&#8208;based homogeneous and heterogeneous multi&#8208;catalytic systems cooperate to provide advantages over conventional catalytic systems, such as higher compatibility or increased sustainability. This simple, yet powerful strategy has an untapped potential to address important challenges in organic chemistry.







Abstract
The combination of metal&#8208;based homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts in the same reaction media is a powerful, yet relatively unexplored approach in organic chemistry. This strategy can address important limitations associated with purely homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysis such as the incompatibility of different catalytic species in solution, or the limited tunability of solid catalysts, respectively. Moreover, the facile reusability of the solid catalyst, contributes to increase the overall sustainability of the process. As a result, this semi&#8208;heterogeneous multi&#8208;catalytic approach has unlocked significant advances in organic chemistry, improving existing reactions and even enabling the discovery of novel transformations, exemplified by the formal alkane metathesis. This concept article aims to showcase the benefits of this strategy through the exploration of diverse relevant examples from the literature, hoping to spur research on new metal&#8208;based homogeneous&#8208;heterogeneous catalyst combinations that will result in reactivity challenging to achieve by conventional homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysis alone.

         <title>Exploring the Esterase Catalytic Activity of Minimalist Heptapeptide Amyloid Fibers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The esterase activity of minimalist amyloid fibers, made up of seven&#8208;residue peptides IHIHIHI and IHIHIQI, is examined using computational techniques. Contrary to initial assumptions, computational simulations reveal that the twist angle of the fiber is not notably influenced by the sixth residue, the reduction in the energy barrier when Gln is present being attributed to the formation of hydrogen bonds with the substrate.







Abstract
This paper investigates the esterase activity of minimalist amyloid fibers composed of short seven&#8208;residue peptides, IHIHIHI (IH7) and IHIHIQI (IH7Q), with a particular focus on the role of the sixth residue position within the peptide sequence. Through computational simulations and analyses, we explore the molecular mechanisms underlying catalysis in these amyloid&#8208;based enzymes. Contrary to initial hypotheses, our study reveals that the twist angle of the fiber, and thus the catalytic site's environment, is not notably affected by the sixth residue. Instead, the sixth residue interacts with the p&#8208;nitrophenylacetate (pNPA) substrate, particularly through its &#8722;NO2 group, potentially enhancing catalysis. Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations of the reaction mechanism suggest that the polarizing effect of glutamine enhances catalytic activity by forming a stabilizing network of hydrogen bonds with pNPA, leading to lower energy barriers and a more exergonic reaction. Our findings provide valuable insights into the intricate interplay between peptide sequence, structural arrangement, and catalytic function in amyloid&#8208;based enzymes, offering potentially valuable information for the design and optimization of biomimetic catalysts.

         <title>A Hydrogen Bonded Non&#8208;Porous Organic&#8208;Inorganic Framework for Measuring Cysteine in Blood Plasma and Endogenous Cancer Cell</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article reports the synthesis of a non&#8208;luminescent one&#8208;dimensional hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic&#8208;inorganic framework (HOIF) of Cu(II) and its affinity studies with cysteine. Cysteine measurement by HOIF has been validated using a commercial dye, &#8220;Cysteine Green&#8221;. The probe is suitable for measuring cysteine in plasma and bio&#8208;imaging endogenous cysteine in cancer cells.







Abstract
An imbalance in cysteine (Cys) levels in the cells and plasma has been identified as the risk indicator for various human diseases. The structural similarity of cysteine with its congener homocysteine and glutathione offers challenges in its measurement. Herein, we report a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic&#8208;inorganic framework of Cu(II) (HOIF) for the selective detection of cysteine over other biothiols. The non&#8208;fluorescent HOIF showed 12&#8208;fold green emission in the presence of cysteine. The monomeric unit of HOIF is stabilized via intermolecular hydrogen bonds, resulting in a non&#8208;porous network structure. Non&#8208;interference from homocysteine, glutathione, and other competitive bio&#8208;analytes revealed explicit affinity of HOIF for cysteine. Fluorimetric titration showed a wide working concentration window (650&#8197;nM&#8211;800&#8197;&#956;M) for measuring cysteine in an aqueous medium. The mechanistic investigation involving HRMS, EPR, and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopic studies revealed the decomplexation of HOIF with Cys, resulting in a fluorescence turn&#8208;on response from the luminescent ligand. Validation using a commercial dye, &#8220;Cysteine Green&#8221;, confirmed the prospect of HOIF for early diagnostic purposes. Utilizing the fluorescence turn&#8208;on property of HOIF in the presence of cysteine, we measured cysteine quantitatively in the blood plasma samples. Bio&#8208;imaging of endogenous cysteine in cancer cells indicated the ability of HOIF to monitor the intracellular cysteine.

         <title>Reproducible Green Syntheses Using Hybrid Sol&#8208;Gel Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aiming to contribute to eradicate a certain naivet&#233; common to many research chemists specializing in green chemistry and catalysis, this study illustrates through selected examples of reproducible green syntheses using hybrid sol&#8208;gel catalysts from doctoral theses and research articles published between 2013 and early 2024, how said catalysts have been applied to a number industrially relevant green synthetic methods.







Abstract
Referring to selected examples of reproducible green syntheses using hybrid sol&#8208;gel catalysts of the SiliaCat series from different doctoral theses and research works published between 2015 and early 2024, this study briefly illustrates how said catalysts have been applied in a number of green synthetic methods of significant industrial relevance. This shows evidence that the nanochemistry &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; sol&#8208;gel approach based on catalytic species entrapped in organically modified silicas as effective and versatile heterogeneous catalysts developed between the late 1990s and 2010 has succeeded. Subsequent developments will show how the use of said materials in automated syntheses, supplying data to machine learning algorithms actually leads to faster and cheaper optimization of the reaction conditions. Said progress ultimately will further accelerate industrial uptake of heterogeneous catalysis under flow in the fine chemical industry whose reluctance to change processes was due to the need to replace financially amortized (and expensive) production plants.

         <title>Probing Basal and Prismatic Planes of Graphitic Materials for Metal Single Atom and Subnanometer Cluster Stabilization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The detection of small quantities of metal clusters in single atom catalysts remains a challenge even when combining electron microscopy (EM), X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results obtained demonstrate that Rh single atoms are mainly present on materials presenting prismatic surface, and that catalysis itself constitutes a valuable tool for the characterization of these materials.







Abstract
Supported metal single atom catalysis is a dynamic research area in catalysis science combining the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. Understanding the interactions between metal single atoms and the support constitutes a challenge facing the development of such catalysts, since these interactions are essential in optimizing the catalytic performance. For conventional carbon supports, two types of surfaces can contribute to single atom stabilization: the basal planes and the prismatic surface; both of which can be decorated by defects and surface oxygen groups. To date, most studies on carbon&#8208;supported single atom catalysts focused on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbons, which, unlike classic carbon materials, have a fairly well&#8208;defined chemical environment. Herein we report the synthesis, characterization and modeling of rhodium single atom catalysts supported on carbon materials presenting distinct concentrations of surface oxygen groups and basal/prismatic surface area. The influence of these parameters on the speciation of the Rh species, their coordination and ultimately on their catalytic performance in hydrogenation and hydroformylation reactions is analyzed. The results obtained show that catalysis itself is an interesting tool for the fine characterization of these materials, for which the detection of small quantities of metal clusters remains a challenge, even when combining several cutting&#8208;edge analytical methods.

         <title>Highly Graphitized Coal Tar Pitch&#8208;Derived Porous Carbon as High&#8208;Performance Lithium Storage Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report that excellent porous carbon materials are obtained by modulating different proportions of coal tar pitch and nano&#8208;calcium carbonate powder (CTP&#8722;X). CTP&#8208;2 exhibits excellent cycling and multiplication performance when used as an anode for LIBs, and is expected to be used as an electrode material for the next generation LIBs.







Abstract
Because of its high specific capacity and superior rate performance, porous carbon is regarded as a potential anode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, porous carbon materials with wide pore diameter distributions suffer from low structural stability and low electrical conductivity during the application process. During this study, the calcium carbonate nanoparticle template method is used to prepare coal tar pitch&#8208;derived porous carbon (CTP&#8722;X). The coal tar pitch&#8208;derived porous carbon has a well&#8208;developed macroporous&#8208;mesoporous&#8208;microporous hierarchical porous network structure, which provides abundant active sites for Li+ storage, significantly reduces polarization and charge transfer resistance, shortens the diffusion path and promotes the rapid transport of Li+. More specifically, the CTP&#8208;2 anode shows high charge capacity (496.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1), excellent rate performance (413.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1), and high cycling stability (capacity retention rate of about 100&#8201;% after 1,000 cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). The clean and eco&#8208;friendly large&#8208;scale utilization of coal tar pitch will facilitate the development of high&#8208;performance anodes in the field of LIBs.

         <title>Active Site Environment and Reactivity of Copper&#8208;A&#946; in Membrane Mimetic SDS Micellar Environment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper interacts with A&#946; peptides in membrane&#8208;mimicking SDS micellar environments, forming Cu&#8208;A&#946; complexes that induce higher hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. Moreover, we observe an increased oxidation rate of neurotransmitter such as dopamine in the presence of H2O2 by Cu&#8208;A&#946; complexes.







Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the abnormal aggregation of amyloid &#946; (A&#946;) peptide in extracellular deposits generated upon proteolysis of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP). While copper (Cu(II)) binds to A&#946; in soluble oligomeric and aggregated forms, its interaction with membrane&#8208;bound A&#946; remains elusive. Investigating these interactions is crucial for understanding AD pathogenesis. Here, utilizing SDS micelles as a simplified membrane mimic, we focus on elucidating the interplay between membrane&#8208;anchored A&#946; and copper, given their pivotal roles in AD. We employed spectroscopic techniques including UV, CD, and EPR to characterize the active site of Cu&#8208;A&#946; complexes. Our findings demonstrate that copper interacts with A&#946; peptides in membrane&#8208;mimicking micellar environments similarly to aqueous buffer solutions. Cu&#8208;A&#946; complexes in this medium also induce higher hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production, potentially contributing to AD&#8208;related oxidative stress. Moreover, we observe an increased oxidation rate of neurotransmitter such as dopamine by Cu&#8208;A&#946; complexes. These results enhance our understanding of Cu&#8208;A&#946; interactions in AD pathology and offer insights into potential therapeutic interventions targeting this interaction.

         <title>Thiolated Cyanines Appended to Partially Pegylated Gold Nanoparticles for Fluorescence Quenching of Two&#8208;Channel Photothermal Inks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyanine dyes equipped with a thiolated bridge are non&#8208;fluorescent when grafted on partially&#8208;pegilated Au nanoparticles. The cyanine/AuNP pegilated hybrids can be dissolved in water/alcohol mixtures to give nanoinks, whose printouts display two photothermally responsive absorption bands, that give different T increases when laser&#8208;irradiated.







Abstract
Following a new approach, we prepared a nanoink with two separate photothermally responsive absorption bands. One is the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) absorption of gold nanoparticles (AuNP, d=17&#8197;nm), the second is the absorption band of two cyanine (Cy) dyes, Cy7&#8208;C6 or Cy7&#8208;C11, grafted to the AuNP surface through thiolated bridges of different lengths: the close proximity to the Au surface induces full quenching of the Cy fluorescence, resulting in thermal relaxation on irradiation. Attempts to full coat AuNP with the lipophilic Cy7&#8208;C6 and Cy7&#8208;C11 lead to precipitation from aqueous solutions. We thus prepared AuNP with partial pegylation (30, 50, or 70&#8201;%), using a long chain thiol&#8208;terminated PEG bearing a &#8208;COOH function. Addition until saturation of either Cy7&#8208;C6 or Cy7&#8208;C11 to the partially pegylated AuNP gave the AuNP@Cy/PEGX% hybrids (X=30, 50, 70) that are stable in water and in the water/alcohol mixtures used to prepare the nanoinks. Further overcoating of AuNP@Cy7&#8208;C6/PEG50&#8201;% with PAH (polyallylamine hydrochloride) avoids LSPR hybridization in the dry nanoink printouts, that present two separate bands. When irradiated with laser sources near their absorption maxima, the printouts of the AuNP@Cy7&#8208;C6/PEG50&#8201;%@PAH nanoink respond on two channels, giving different temperature increases depending on the irradiation wavelengths. This enhances the potentiality of use of these nanoinks for photothermal anticounterfait printouts, making more difficult to reproduce the correct &#916;T vs &#955;irradiation output.

         <title>A Novel Fluorescent Gemcitabine Prodrug That Follows a Nucleoside Transporter&#8208;Independent Internalization and Bears Enhanced Therapeutic Efficacy With Respect to Gemcitabine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorescent prodrug, named GF, based on gemcitabine and 5(6)&#8208;carboxyfluorescein was developed in a single step. GF follows a nucleoside transporter&#8208;independent endocytosis internalization mechanism, surpassing a key resistance mechanism against gemcitabine. Its pharmacokinetic profile and drug release efficiency were evaluated in mice, and eventually its visualization was achieved in zebrafish and its tumor inhibition was monitored in A549 xenografted mice.







Abstract
The multiplexity of cancer has rendered it the second leading cause of mortality worldwide and theragnostic prodrugs have gained popularity in recent years as a means of treatment. Theragnostic prodrugs enable the simultaneous diagnosis and therapy of tumors via high&#8208;precision real&#8208;time drug release monitoring. Herein, we report the development of the small theragnostic prodrug GF, based on the nucleoside anticancer agent gemcitabine and the fluorescent dye 5(6)&#8208;carboxyfluorescein. We have successfully demonstrated its efficient internalization in tumor cells, showing localization throughout both the early and late endocytic pathways. Its mechanism of cell internalization was evaluated, confirming its independence from nucleoside transporters. Its cellular localization via confocal microscopy revealed a clathrin&#8208;mediated endocytosis mechanism, distinguishing it from analogous compounds studied previously. Furthermore, GF exhibited stability across various pH values and in human blood plasma. Subsequently, its in&#8197;vitro cytotoxicity was assessed in three human cancer cell lines (A549, U87 and T98). Additionally, its pharmacokinetic profile in mice was investigated and the consequent drug release was monitored.

     alt="A Novel Fluorescent Gemcitabine Prodrug That Follows a Nucleoside Transporter-Independent Internalization and Bears Enhanced Therapeutic Efficacy With Respect to Gemcitabine"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fluorescent prodrug, named GF, based on gemcitabine and 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein was developed in a single step. GF follows a nucleoside transporter-independent endocytosis internalization mechanism, surpassing a key resistance mechanism against gemcitabine. Its pharmacokinetic profile and drug release efficiency were evaluated in mice, and eventually its visualization was achieved in zebrafish and its tumor inhibition was monitored in A549 xenografted mice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The multiplexity of cancer has rendered it the second leading cause of mortality worldwide and theragnostic prodrugs have gained popularity in recent years as a means of treatment. Theragnostic prodrugs enable the simultaneous diagnosis and therapy of tumors via high-precision real-time drug release monitoring. Herein, we report the development of the small theragnostic prodrug &lt;b&gt;GF&lt;/b&gt;, based on the nucleoside anticancer agent gemcitabine and the fluorescent dye 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein. We have successfully demonstrated its efficient internalization in tumor cells, showing localization throughout both the early and late endocytic pathways. Its mechanism of cell internalization was evaluated, confirming its independence from nucleoside transporters. Its cellular localization via confocal microscopy revealed a clathrin-mediated endocytosis mechanism, distinguishing it from analogous compounds studied previously. Furthermore, &lt;b&gt;GF&lt;/b&gt; exhibited stability across various pH values and in human blood plasma. Subsequently, its &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt; cytotoxicity was assessed in three human cancer cell lines (A549, U87 and T98). Additionally, its pharmacokinetic profile in mice was investigated and the consequent drug release was monitored. Finally, its &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vivo&lt;/i&gt; visualization was accomplished in zebrafish xenotransplantation models and its &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vivo&lt;/i&gt; efficacy was evaluated in A549 xenografts. The results unveiled an intriguing efficacy profile, positioning &lt;b&gt;GF&lt;/b&gt; as a compelling candidate warranting further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Contact Electrification as an Emerging Strategy for Controlling the Performance of Metal Nanoparticle Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As modern technology enters the era of nanomaterials, the contact electrification, as a classic physical phenomenon, brings new ideas for studying the interactions between metal nanoparticles. The study of contact electrification phenomenon by classical theory shows that the Fermi level of materials before and after contact changes. This conclusion is further confirmed by modern characterization techniques, and this change in the Fermi level of materials is reflected in the field of catalysis, which can regulate the performance of catalysts in catalytic reactions.







Abstract
Contact electrification (CE) is an emerging strategy for controlling the performance of metal nanoparticle (NP) catalysts. The underlying physical principle of this control is the sensitivity of the Fermi level to metal&#8208;metal contacts. This change in electronic structure has a direct impact on surface properties and chemical reactivity. The concept article briefly introduces the basic theory of CE and its relationship to catalytic performance. We then highlight selected recent examples of advances in the preparation of hybrid metal NP assemblies, experimental techniques for characterizing CE, and finally applications of CE for altering catalytic performance.

This report presents an environmentally benign synthesis of 1,2,3&#8208;benzotriazines through an iodide&#8208;catalyzed electro&#8208;oxidative skeletal editing of 3&#8208;aminoindazoles. The method uses electrochemically generated reactive iodide species without involving any transition metal catalysts and peroxides. This mild reaction protocol exhibits a wide substrate scope with brad synthetic applicability. Detailed mechanistic studies elucidate a N&#8208;centered [1,2]&#8208;rearrangement as the key reaction step.

         <title>Gold Nanoclusters Whose Photoluminescent Properties are Dynamically Tunable by Modulating the Assembly Pathway Complexity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Gold nanoclusters (DPT&#8208;AuNCs) could self&#8208;assembles into two distinct aggregation structures in MeOH/water mixed solvent, exhibiting pathway complexity with different photoluminescent property. DPT&#8208;AuNCs firstly assembles into non&#8208;luminescent nanofibers (kinetically controlled), which further transforms into strongly luminescent microflowers (thermodynamically controlled).







Abstract
Modulating the assembly pathway is an indispensable strategy for optimizing the performance of optical materials. However, implementing this strategy is nontrivial for metal nanocluster building blocks, due to the limited functional modification of nanoclusters and complexity of their emission mechanism. In this report, we demonstrate that a gold nanocluster modified by 4,6&#8208;diamino&#8208;2&#8208;pyrimidinethiol (DPT&#8208;AuNCs) self&#8208;assembles into two distinct aggregation structures in methanol (MeOH)/water mixed solvent, thus exhibiting pathway complexity. Kinetic studies show that DPT&#8208;AuNCs firstly assembles into non&#8208;luminescent nanofibers (kinetically controlled), which further transforms into strongly luminescent microflowers (thermodynamically controlled). In&#8208;depth analysis of the assembly mechanism reveals that the transformation of aggregation structures involves the disassembly of nanofibers and a subsequent nucleation&#8208;growth process. Temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and infrared (IR) measurements reveal that inter&#8208;cluster hydrogen bonding bridged by solvent molecules and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction are the key factors for emission enhancement. The photoluminescent property of DPT&#8208;AuNCs can be controlled by varying the cosolvent in water, enabling DPT&#8208;AuNCs to distinguish different kind of alcohols, particularly the isomerism n&#8208;propanol (NPA) and isopropanol (IPA). Additionally, the addition of seeds effectively regulate the assembly kinetics of DPT&#8208;AuNCs. This study advances our understanding of assembly pathways and improves the luminescent performance of nanoclusters (NCs).

         <title>Searching for &#8220;Greener&#8221; Bioequivalents of CF3 to Lower its Environmental Impact</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Considering concerns on the negative environmental effects of CF3 containing compounds, we searched for &#8220;greener&#8221; alternatives. We found &#8722;I as the best alternative since it is equivalent in all aspects studied, size, electronic and lipophilic, followed by &#8722;F, &#8208;cyclo&#8208;Pr, &#8722;2&#8208;oxetyl, &#8722;SF5 and &#8722;SCH3. We suggest using these functionalities as an alternative to &#8722;CF3 in the preparation of new therapies.







Abstract
Considering the broad use of the trifluoromethyl functional group (&#8722;CF3) in medicinal chemistry and taking into account the recent concerns on the negative environmental effects of CF3 containing compounds, we are searching for &#8220;greener&#8221; alternatives. Thus, different chemical groups (i.&#8201;e. iodide, fluoride, cyclopropyl, isopropyl, cyclobutyl, 3&#8208;oxetyl, 2&#8208;oxetyl, methylsulfide, pentafluorosulfide, methylsulfonyl and sulfonamide) have been considered as potential bioequivalents of &#8722;CF3 aiming to use them in compounds with therapeutic interest instead of the polyfluoride functionality. Different structural (molecular surface and volume) and physicochemical (electronic and lipophilic) aspects of the bioequivalent functionalities proposed have been theoretically calculated and compared to those of &#8722;CF3. Additionally, the corresponding phenyl derivatives carrying these functionalities have been purchased or prepared and their experimental lipophilicity (i.&#8201;e. LogP) measured using shake&#8208;flask experiments and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy.

         <title>Stereochemically Active Lone Pairs Stabilizing Intrinsic Vacancy Defects in Thermoelectric InTe</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermoelectric InTe exhibits significant structural disorder in the form of In+ vacancies. Using 3D&#8208;&#916;PDF informed Monte&#8208;Carlo simulations we reveal the local structure associated with these defects. This structure allows the local expression of stereochemically active lone pairs with an associated electronic energy gain, which is proposed to be a driving force for the formation of the intrinsic vacancy defects.







Abstract
Harvesting waste heat efficiently with thermoelectric energy conversion requires materials with low thermal conductivity. Recently, it was demonstrated how dynamic lone pair expression in thermoelectric InTe is responsible for giant anharmonicity leading to a very low lattice thermal conductivity. InTe also contains correlated disorder of intrinsic defects due to vacancies, and this contributes to additional lowering of the thermal conductivity. Here we use the three&#8208;dimensional difference pair distribution function (3D&#8208;&#916;PDF) to analyze 25&#8197;K single crystal diffuse X&#8208;ray scattering from InTe to unravel the local defect structure, and propose a microscopic structural model. Extended off&#8208;centering of In+ ions induced by vacancies allows for the local expression of stereochemically active lone pairs. The associated electronic stabilization is proposed to be a driving force for the formation of In+ vacancy defects in InTe.

&lt;p&gt;Thermoelectric InTe exhibits significant structural disorder in the form of In&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; vacancies. Using 3D-&#916;PDF informed Monte-Carlo simulations we reveal the local structure associated with these defects. This structure allows the local expression of stereochemically active lone pairs with an associated electronic energy gain, which is proposed to be a driving force for the formation of the intrinsic vacancy defects.

         <title>Electrochemical Decarboxylative Cross&#8208;Coupling with Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct electrochemical decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling with nucleophiles has been developed for the synthesis of structurally diverse fluoride, alcohol, ether, ester, and amine products. This strategy takes advantage of the ready availability of these building blocks from commercial libraries, as well as the mild and oxidant&#8208;free conditions provided by the electrochemical system.







Abstract
Decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling reactions are powerful tools for carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds formation, but typically require pre&#8208;activated carboxylic acids as substrates or heteroelectrophiles as functional groups. Herein, we present an electrochemical decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling of carboxylic acids with structurally diverse fluorine, alcohol, H2O, acid, and amine as nucleophiles. This strategy takes advantage of the ready availability of these building blocks from commercial libraries, as well as the mild and oxidant&#8208;free conditions provided by electrochemical system. This reaction demonstrates good functional&#8208;group tolerance and its utility in late&#8208;stage functionalization.

         <title>The Hybridization of Polymers with Metal Oxide Clusters for the Design of Non&#8208;Fluorinated Proton Exchange Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cost&#8208;effective composite non&#8208;fluorinated proton exchange membranes (PEMs) with excellent overall performance are essential to realize the economical and efficient fabrication of fuel cells. Herein, we briefly discuss on design strategy, research progress, and application prospects of PEMs based on the polymer composites of nanoscale metal oxide clusters.







Abstract
As the key component of various energy storage and conversion devices, proton exchange membranes (PEMs) have been attracting significant interest. However, their further development is limited by the high cost of perfluorosulfonic acid polymers and the poor stability of acid&#8208;dopped non&#8208;fluorinated polymers. Recently, a new group of PEMs has been developed by hybridizing polyoxometalates (POMs), a group of super acidic sub&#8208;nanoscale metal oxide clusters, with polymers. POMs can serve simultaneously as both proton sponges and stabilizing agents, and their complexation with polymers can further improve polymers&#8217; mechanical performance and processability. Enormous efforts have been focused on studying supramolecular complexation or covalent grafting of POMs with various polymers to optimize PEMs in terms of cost, mechanical properties and stabilities. This concept summarizes recent advances in this emerging field and outlines the design strategies and application perspectives employed for using POM&#8208;polymer hybrid materials as PEMs.

         <title>Prediction of Covalent Metal&#8208;Metal Bonding in Cp&#8722;M&#8722;M&#8217;&#8208;Nacnac Complexes of Group 2 and 12 Metals (Be, Mg, Ca, Zn, Cd, Hg)</title>

Cp&#8722;M&#8722;M&#8242;&#8208;Nacnac complexes (M=Be, Mg, Ca, Zn, Cd, Hg) are predicted to exhibit electron&#8208;sharing covalent metal&#8208;metal bonds with a [MM&#8242;]2+ core. QTAIM predicts non&#8208;nuclear attractors (NNAs) with substantial electron density in the BeBe, MgMg, and CaCa complexes, suggesting that these metal&#8208;metal bonds also retain significant metallic character that can be associated with reducing reactivity. The novel metal&#8208;metal bonding makes for appealing synthetic targets.







Abstract
Bimetallic CpMM'Nacnac molecules with group 2 and 12 metals (M=Be, Mg, Ca, Zn, Cd, Hg) that contain novel metal&#8208;metal bonding have been investigated in a theoretical study of their molecular and electronic structure, thermodynamic stability, and metal&#8208;metal bonding. In all cases the metal&#8208;metal bonds are characterized as electron&#8208;sharing covalent single bonds from natural bond orbital (NBO) and energy&#8208;decomposition analysis with natural orbitals of chemical valence (EDA&#8208;NOCV) analysis. The sum of [MM&#8242;] charges is relatively constant, with all complexes exhibiting a [MM&#8242;]2+ core. Quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) analysis indicates the presence of non&#8208;nuclear attractors (NNA) in the metal&#8208;metal bonds of the BeBe, MgMg, and CaCa complexes. There is substantial electron density (0.75&#8211;1.33&#8197;e) associated with the NNAs, which indicates that these metal&#8208;metal bonds, while classified as covalent electron&#8208;sharing bonds, retain significant metallic character that can be associated with reducing reactivity of the complex. The predicted stability of these complexes, combined with their novel covalent metal&#8208;metal bonding and potential as reducing agents, make them appealing targets for the synthesis of new metal&#8208;metal bonds.

         <title>Narrowband Blue Circularly Polarized Luminescence Emitter Based on BN&#8208;Doped Benzo[6]helicene with Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two 1,4&#8208;azaborinine [6]helicenes, H[6]BN1 and H[6]BN2, exhibit blue fluorescence with narrow FWHMs below 31&#8197;nm and high PLQY up to 92&#8201;%. Desirable circularly polarized luminescence with glum reaching 4~5&#215;10&#8722;4 and good configurational stability are relized for H[6]BN1 and H[6]BN2. Mechanochromism occurs between H[6]BN1&#8242;s crystalline and amorphous states by modulationg &#960;&#8208;&#960; intermolecular interanctions. An turquoise OLED based H[6]BN1 is manufactured with the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 3.18&#8201;%.







Abstract
Boron&#8208;doped helicenes, known for their unique electronic and photophysical properties, are of great interest for numerous applications. This research introduces two new azabora[6]helicenes, H[6]BN1 and H[6]BN2, synthesized through an efficient method. These molecules have boron and nitrogen atoms in opposing positions, enhancing their distinctive attributes. Both helicenes show excellent emission properties, with H[6]BN1 and H[6]BN2 exhibiting narrowband blue fluorescence and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), achieving glum values of 4~5&#215;10&#8722;4 which is beneficial for chiroptical applications. The addition of a donor group, 3, 6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole, in H[6]BN2 improves luminescence, likely due to enhanced molecular orbital overlap and electron delocalization. H[6]BN1&#8242;s needle&#8208;like single crystals exhibit mechanochromism, changing luminescent color from yellow to green under mechanical stress, which is promising for stimulus&#8208;responsive materials. In conclusion, this study presents a novel class of BN[6]helicenes with superior chiroptical properties. Their combination of electronic features and mechanochromism makes them ideal for advanced chiroptical materials, expanding the potential of helicene&#8208;based compounds and offering new directions for the synthesis of molecules with specific chiroptical characteristics.
