      <title>Forty Years After the Discovery of its Nucleolytic Activity: [Cu(phen)2]2+ Shows Unattended DNA Cleavage Activity Upon Fluorination</title>
      <dc:description>[Cu(  phen  )  2  ]  2+  (  phen&#160;  =&#160;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline) is the first and still one of most efficient artificial nucleases. In general, when the  phen  ligand is modified, the nucleolytic activity of its Cu(II) complex is significantly reduced. This is most likely due to higher steric bulk of such ligands and thus lower affinity to DNA. Cu(II) complexes with  phen  ligands having fluorinated substituents (F, CF  3  , SF  5  , SCF  3  ) surprisingly showed excellent DNA cleavage activity &#8211; in contrast to the unsubstituted [Cu(  phen  )  2  ]  2+  &#8211; in the absence of the otherwise required external reducing agents. This nucleolytic activity correlates well with the half&#8208;wave potentials  E  1/2  of the complexes. Cancer cell studies show cytotoxic effects of all complexes with fluorinated ligands in the low &#181;M range, whereas they were less toxic towards healthy cells (fibroblasts).</dc:description>

      <title>Regiospecific Synthesis of Calcium&#8208;Independent Daptomycin Antibiotics Using a Chemoenzymatic Method</title>
      <dc:description>Daptomycin (DAP) is a calcium (Ca2+)&#8208;dependent FDA&#8208;approved antibiotic drug for the treatment of Gram&#8208;positive infections. It possesses a complex pharmacophore hampering derivatization and/or synthesis of analogs. In order to mimic the Ca2+&#8208;binding effect we uses a chemoenzymatic approach to modify the tryptophan (Trp) residue of DAP and synthesize kinetically characterized and structurally elucidated regiospecific Trp&#8208;modified DAP analogs. We demonstrated that the modified DAPs are several&#8208;folds active than the parent molecule against antibiotic&#8208;susceptible and antibiotic&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. Strikingly and in contrast to the parent molecule, the DAP derivatives do not rely on calcium or any additional elements for activity.</dc:description>

      <title>Iridium(III) Sensitizers and Energy Upconversion: The Influence of Ligand Structure Upon TTA&#8208;UC Performance</title>
      <dc:description>Six substituted ligands based upon 2&#8208;(naphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;yl)quinoline&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylate and 2&#8208;(naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)quinoline&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylate have been synthesized in two steps from a range of commercially available isatin derivatives. These species are demonstrated to be effective cyclometalating ligands for Ir(III) yielding complexes of the form [Ir(C^N)2(bipy)]PF6 (where C^N = cyclometalating ligand; bipy = 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine). X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies on three examples demonstrate that the complexes adopt a distorted octahedral geometry wherein a cis&#8208;C,C and trans&#8208;N,N coordination mode is observed. Intra&#8208;ligand torsional distortions are evident in all cases. The Ir(III) complexes display photoluminescence in the red part of the visible region (668&#8208;693 nm) which is modestly tuneable via the ligand structure. The triplet lifetimes of the complexes are clearly influenced by the precise structure of the ligand in each case. Supporting computational (DFT) studies suggest that the differences in observed triplet lifetime are likely due to differing admixtures of ligand&#8208;centred versus MLCT character instilled by the facets of the ligand structure. Triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) measurements demonstrate that the complexes based upon the 1&#8208;naphthyl derived ligands are viable photosensitizers with upconversion quantum efficiencies of 1.6&#8208;6.7%.</dc:description>

      <title>A high&#8208;efficiency hematite photoanode with enhanced bonding energy around Fe atoms</title>
      <dc:description>Hematite nanoarray is an important photoanode materials. However, it suffers from serious problems of charge transfer and surface states, especially the surface states hinder the increase of photocurrent. Previous strategy to suppress the surface state is the deposition of Fe&#8208;free metal oxide overlayer. Herein, from the viewpoint of atomic bonding energy, we discover that the strength of bonding around Fe atoms in the hematite is the keypoint to suppress the surface states. By treating the surface of hematite with Se and NaBH  4  , the Fe  2  O  3  transfers to be a double&#8208;layer nanostructure. In the outer layer, the Fe&#8208;O bonding is reinforced and the Fe&#8208;Se bonding is even stronger. Therefore, the surface states are inhibited and the increase of the photocurrent density becomes much faster. Besides, the treatment construct a nanoscale p&#8208;n junction to promote the charge transfer. Improvements are achieved in onset potential (0.25 V shift) and in photocurrent density (5.8 times). This work pinpoints the keypoint to suppress the surface states and prepare high&#8208;efficiency hematite nanoarray, and deepens our understanding of the hematite photoanode.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The direct trifluoromethylation of a variety of aliphatic alcohols using a hypervalent iodosulfoximine reagent affords the corresponding ethers in moderate to good yields (14&#8208;72%). Primary, secondary and even tertiary alcohols, including examples derived from natural products, undergo this transformation in the presence of catalytic amounts of zinc bis(triflimide).

      <dc:description>
Bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) provide opportunities for the sustainable conversion of energy from biological metabolism. Biological photovoltaics (BPVs) and microbial fuel cells (MFCs) respectively realize the conversion of renewable solar energy and bioenergy into electrical energy by utilizing electroactive biological extracellular electron transfer, however, along with this energy conversion progress, relatively poor durability and low output performance are challenges as well as opportunities. Conjugated polymers (CPs) with specific optical and electrical properties afforded by &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbones are conducive to enhancing the electron generation and output capacity of electroactive organisms. In this minireview, the prominent contributions of CPs in the aspect of augmenting the photovoltaic response of BPVs and power supply of MFCs are summarized to provide inspirations for the design of bioelectronic devices in the future. For more information, see the Minireview by F. Lv and S. Wang et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;15065&#8197;ff.

      <title>Frontispiece: Selective Release of Doxorubicin from Cucurbit[8]uril Stabilized Gold Supra&#8208;Pyramid Host at pH of Small Intestine</title>
      <dc:description>
Chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin is used in permutation with additional medicines to treat various types of cancer including Hodgkin&#8242;s, non&#8208;Hodgkin&#8242;s lymphoma and acute myeloid leukemia. Doxorubicin, which is intravenously administered till date, has been loaded in cucurbit[8]uril stabilized gold supra&#8208;pyramid host for mimicking oral delivery. In this work, the release of doxorubicin from host selectively at small intestinal pH opens the possibility of oral administration of this drug in future. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K.&#8197;K. Sadhu et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;15150&#8197;ff.

      <title>Isomers of B&#8592;N&#8208;Fused Dibenzo&#8208;azaacenes: How B&#8592;N Affects Opto&#8208;electronic Properties and Device Behaviors?</title>
      <dc:description>B&#8592;N unit has a large dipole and is isoelectronic to C&#8210;C moiety with no dipole. Incorporating B&#8592;N units to &#960;&#8208;conjugated system is a powerful strategy to design organic small molecules and polymers with intriguing opto&#8208;electronic properties and excellent opto&#8208;electronic device performance. However, it is unclear how B&#8592;N unit affects electronic structures and opto&#8208;electronic properties of large &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules. In this work, to address this question, we develop three dibenzo&#8208;azaacene molecules incorporated with two B&#8592;N units at different positions. Although the dibenzo&#8208;azaacene skeleton is fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated, the effect of B&#8592;N unit on the electronic structures of the adjacent rings is much stronger than that of the distant rings. As a result, the three molecules with isomerized B&#8592;N incorporation patterns possess different electronic structures and exhibit tunable opto&#8208;electronic properties. Among the three molecules, the centrosymmetrical molecule exhibits higher LUMO/HOMO energy levels than those of the two axisymmetrical molecules. When used as the active layer in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs), while the two axisymmetrical molecules show unipolar electron transporting property, the centrosymmetrical molecule exhibits ambipolar hole and electron transporting behavior. This work not only deepens our understanding on organoboron &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules, but also indicates a new strategy to tune opto&#8208;electronic properties of organic semiconductors for excellent device performance.</dc:description>

      <title>A Calix[4]arene&#8208;Based Cyclic Dinuclear Ruthenium Complex for Light&#8208;Driven Catalytic Water Oxidation</title>
      <dc:description>
Making water run up a thermodynamic hill: The thermodynamically demanding oxidation of water to molecular oxygen is a critical bottleneck for the generation of carbon&#8208;neutral fuels. Homogenous light&#8208;driven water oxidation by a newly designed cyclic dinuclear Ru(bda) catalyst equipped with axial calix[4]arene ligands revealed an outstanding catalytic activity and is thus of potential interest for artificial photosynthesis.







Abstract
A cyclic dinuclear ruthenium(bda) (bda: 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;6,6&#8217;&#8208;dicarboxylate) complex equipped with oligo(ethylene glycol)&#8208;functionalized axial calix[4]arene ligands has been synthesized for homogenous catalytic water oxidation. This novel Ru(bda) macrocycle showed significantly increased catalytic activity in chemical and photocatalytic water oxidation compared to the archetype mononuclear reference [Ru(bda)(pic)2]. Kinetic investigations, including kinetic isotope effect studies, disclosed a unimolecular water nucleophilic attack mechanism of this novel dinuclear water oxidation catalyst (WOC) under the involvement of the second coordination sphere. Photocatalytic water oxidation with this cyclic dinuclear Ru complex using [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 as a standard photosensitizer revealed a turnover frequency of 15.5&#8197;s&#8722;1 and a turnover number of 460. This so far highest photocatalytic performance reported for a Ru(bda) complex underlines the potential of this water&#8208;soluble WOC for artificial photosynthesis.

      <title>Modulating the electron&#8208;donating ability of acridine donor units for orange&#8208;red thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters</title>
      <dc:description>The development of the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters with orange&#8208;red emission is still lagged behind their blue, green and yellow counterparts. Recent researches to address this problem mainly focused on developing new acceptor units. There were few donor units designed especially for orange&#8208;red emitters. Herein, with the benzothiophene fused to the diphenyl acridine donor unit, a new donor moiety, namely BTDPAc, was designed and synthesized. Benefited from the strong electron&#8208;donating ability of the new donor moiety, a new TADF emitter, BTDPAc&#8208;PhNAI, shows an orange&#8208;red emission with its peak at 610 nm in dilute toluene solution. Also, with the help of the diphenyl rings of the donor unit, high photoluminescence quantum yields (&#934;PL) were achieved for BTDPAc&#8208;PhNAI at a wide concentration range. Consequently, the orange&#8208;red OLED based on BTDPAc&#8208;PhNAI achieved a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of nearly 20%, which is comparable to the state&#8208;of&#8208;art device performances with similar emission spectra.</dc:description>

      <title>Replacing the rhamnose&#8211;xylose moiety of QS&#8208;21 with simpler terminal disaccharide units attenuates adjuvant activity in truncated saponin variants</title>
      <dc:description>Adjuvants are key immunostimulatory components in vaccine formulations that improve the immune response to the co&#8208;administered antigen. The saponin natural product QS&#8208;21 is one of the most promising immunoadjuvants in the development of vaccines against cancer and infectious diseases but suffers from limitations that have hampered its widespread human use. Previous structure&#8208;activity relationship studies have identified simplified saponin variants with truncated carbohydrate chains, but have not focused on the influence of the linear oligosaccharide domain of QS&#8208;21 in adjuvant activity. Herein we report expeditious 15&#8208;step syntheses of new linear trisaccharide variants of simplified QS&#8208;21&#8208;derived adjuvants in which the complex terminal xylose&#8211;rhamnose moiety has been replaced with commercially available, simpler lactose and cellobiose disaccharides in a &#946;&#8208;anomeric configuration.  In vivo  immunological evaluation of the synthetic saponins showed attenuated antibody responses, highlighting the negative impact of such carbohydrate modifications on adjuvant activity, which could be associated with higher saponin conformational flexibility.</dc:description>

      <title>Emerging Implications of the Concept of Hydricity in Energy&#8208;Relevant Catalytic Processes</title>
      <dc:description>&#8216;Hydricity&#8217; of a species refers to its hydride donor ability. The way the p  K  a  concept is useful to determine the extent of proton transfer, the hydricity concept plays a vital role in understanding hydride transfer reactions. A large number of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed processes involve hydride transfer reaction as a key step. Among these, two key reactions &#8211; proton reduction to evolve&#160;H  2  and hydride transfer to CO  2  to generate formate/formic acid &#8211; represent a promising solution to build a sustainable and fossil fuel&#8208;free energy&#8208;economy.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Hydricity&#8217; of a species refers to its hydride donor ability. The way the p  K  a  concept is useful to determine the extent of proton transfer, the hydricity concept plays a vital role in understanding hydride transfer reactions. A large number of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed processes involve hydride transfer reaction as a key step. Among these, two key reactions &#8211; proton reduction to evolve&#160;H  2  and hydride transfer to CO  2  to generate formate/formic acid &#8211; represent a promising solution to build a sustainable and fossil fuel&#8208;free energy&#8208;economy. Therefore, it is imperative to develop an in&#8208;depth relationship of hydricity of transition metal hydrides to its influencing factors so that efficient and suitable hydride transfer catalysts can be designed. Moreover, such a profound knowledge can also help in improving the existing catalysts in terms of their efficiency and working mechanism.

      <dc:description>
Metals vs. fungi: Given that metal complexes have proven to be useful new chemotypes in the fight against diseases such as cancer, malaria, and bacterial infections, it is reasonable to explore their possible utility in treating fungal infections. Herein we report a series of cobalt(III) Schiff base complexes with broad&#8208;spectrum antifungal activity against Candida and Cryptococcus yeasts, with MICs in the low micro&#8208; to nanomolar range.







Abstract
Resistance to currently available antifungal drugs has quietly been on the rise but overshadowed by the alarming spread of antibacterial resistance. There is a striking lack of attention to the threat of drug&#8208;resistant fungal infections, with only a handful of new drugs currently in development. Given that metal complexes have proven to be useful new chemotypes in the fight against diseases such as cancer, malaria, and bacterial infections, it is reasonable to explore their possible utility in treating fungal infections. Herein we report a series of cobalt(III) Schiff base complexes with broad&#8208;spectrum antifungal activity. Some of these complexes show minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) in the low micro&#8208; to nanomolar range against a series of Candida and Cryptococcus yeasts. Additionally, we demonstrate that these compounds show no cytotoxicity against both bacterial and human cells. Finally, we report the first in&#8197;vivo toxicity data on these compounds in Galleria mellonella, showing that doses as high as 266&#8197;mg&#8201;kg&#8722;1 are tolerated without adverse effects, paving the way for further in&#8197;vivo studies of these complexes.

      <title>Structure&#8208;Directing Roles of Organic Molecules in the Formation of Aluminosilicate and Aluminophosphate Molecular Sieves Revealed by 2D 1H DQ&#8208;SQ NMR Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>
Molecular sieves are generally prepared under hydrothermal conditions with reactions happening in &#8220;black box&#8221; autoclaves; the crystallization mechanism of molecular sieves is still a mystery, therefore, which is depicted by the UFO in the cover image. Further understanding of the crystallization mechanism of molecular sieves is driven by the broad range of usefulness and unique properties they possess. In this work, 2D 1H DQ&#8208;SQ NMR results clearly demonstrate that it is not only the electrostatic interactions between organic structure&#8208;directing agents (OSDAs) and the framework, but also the correlation among OSDAs playing the dominant structural directing roles during the crystallization process. More information can be found in the Communication by X. Liu et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202003892).

      <title>Microwave Detection of Wet Triacetone Triperoxide (TATP): Non&#8208;Covalent Forces and Water Dynamics</title>
      <dc:description>
Triacetone triperoxide (TATP) is an explosive which, due to its ease of synthesis and difficulty of detection, is a common choice for the improvised explosive devices used by terrorists. TATP has no dipole moment so it is undetectable using conventional rotational spectroscopy. However, using supersonic jets it is possible to observe the TATP&#8211;H2O polar adducts opening a way to TATP microwave detection. The main interaction of the adduct is a four&#8208;center trifurcated Ow&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bond. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.&#8197;C. L&#243;pez et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202003499).

A stereogenic twisted cycloparaphenylene that glows with helical green light in a polymer matrix is depicted in the cover image. The helical array of cycloparaphenylene in the molecular structure provides remarkable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in the solid state. In particular, bright and remarkable CPL was observed in the polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) film.

      <title>Use of Crown Ether Functions as Secondary Coordination Spheres for the Manipulation of Ligand&#8211;Metal Intramolecular Electron Transfer in Copper&#8211;Guanidine Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
The directed stimulation of intramolecular electron transfer (IET) between a metal and a redox&#8208;active ligand in a coordination compound is important for a variety of applications in catalysis or material science. In this work we show that stimulation of IET is possible by metal coordination at a secondary coordination sphere. A copper complex with a redox&#8208;active guanidine ligand and a remote crown ether function, dissolved in acetonitrile, could be present as CuI complex with a radical monocationic guanidine ligand or as CuII complex with a neutral guanidine ligand. The preferred electronic structure could be controlled by metal encapsulation into the crown ether function. More information can be found in the Full Paper by H.&#8197;Himmel et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202003469).

      <title>A Domino Fusion of an Organic ligand Depended on Metal&#8208;Induced and Oxygen Insertion, Unraveled by Crystallography, Mass Spectrometry and DFT Calculation</title>
      <dc:description>Here, we report the reaction, CH  3  CN at 120 &#176;C, of (1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methanamine (  L1  ) with Co(H  2  O)  6  Cl  2  leading to the 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrakis(1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyrazine (  3  ), isolated as a dimeric cluster {[Co  II  2  (  3  )Cl  4  ]&#8729;2CH  3  CN} (  2  ). When O  2  and H  2  O are present, (1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole&#8208;2&#8208;carbonyl)amide (  HL1'  ) is first formed and crystallized as [Co  III  (  L1  )  2  (  L1'  )]Cl  2  &#8729;2H  2  O (  4  ) before fusion of H  L1'  with  L1  giving 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;(1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;carbonyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;carboxamide (  HL2''  ) forming one&#8208;dimensional (1D) chain of [Co  II  3  (  L2''  )  2  Cl  4  ]  n  (  5  ). The combination of crystallography and mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) of isolated crystals and the solutions taken from the reaction as a function time reveal seven intermediate steps leading to  2  , but six steps for  5  which a different sequence takes place. Control and isotope labeling experiments confirm the two carbonyl oxygen atoms in  5  originate from both air and water. The dependence on the metals, compared to FeCl  3  &#183;6H  2  O leading to a stable triheteroarylmethyl radical, is quite astounding, which could be attributed to the different oxidation states of the metals and coordination modes confirmed by DFT calculations. This metal and valence dependent process is a very useful way for selectively obtaining these large molecules which are unachievable by common organic synthesis.</dc:description>

      <title>Understanding the C&#8211;F Bond Activation Mediated by Frustrated Lewis Pairs: Crucial Role of Noncovalent Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>The activation of a single C&#8211;F bond in di&#8208; and trifluoromethyl groups by frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) has been computationally explored by means of Density Functional Theory calculations. It is found that in this activation reaction the FLP partners exhibit a peculiar cooperative action, which is markedly different from related FLP&#8208;mediated processes, and where noncovalent interactions established between the Lewis base and the substrate play a decisive role. In addition, the process proceeds through the intermediacy of a hypervalent species featuring a pentacoordinate carbon atom, which is rare in the chemistry of FLPs. The physical factors controlling this process as well as the bonding situation of these hypervalent intermediates have been quantitatively analyzed in detail using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art computational methods to not only rationalize the mechanism of the transformation but also to guide experimentalists towards the realization of these so far elusive hypervalent systems.</dc:description>

      <title>New Members of Stuffed tridymite Structure: Synthesis, Structure, SHG, Optical and Multiferroic Properties</title>
      <dc:description>We explored the stuffed tridymite structure Ba(Zn/Co)  1&#8208;x  Si  1&#8208;x  M  2x  O  4  (M = Al  3+  and Fe  3+  ) for the possible multiferroic behaviour and to develop new inorganic colored materials. The compounds were synthesized employing conventional solid&#8208;state chemistry methods in the temperature range of 1100&#8211;1175 &#176;C for 24 h. The powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) and Rietveld refinement studies indicate that the compounds stabilize in  P  63 space group (no. 173). The refinement results were also rationalized employing Raman spectroscopic studies.The compounds were found to be SHG active and shows a weak ferroelectric behaviour. The co&#8208;substitution of Co  2+  and Fe  3+  in the structure gives rise to a weak ferromagnetic behaviour to the compound, BaCo  0.75  Si  0.75  Fe  0.5  O  4  , making it a multiferroic material. The optical studies on the prepared compounds exhibited blue color (Co  2+  in T  d  geometry); purple color (Ni  2+  in T  d  geometry) and simultaneous substitution of Co  2+  and Fe  3+  gives rise to blue&#8208;green color due to metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (MMCT) effect.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We explored the stuffed tridymite structure Ba(Zn/Co)  1&#8208;x  Si  1&#8208;x  M  2x  O  4  (M = Al  3+  and Fe  3+  ) for the possible multiferroic behaviour and to develop new inorganic colored materials. The compounds were synthesized employing conventional solid&#8208;state chemistry methods in the temperature range of 1100&#8211;1175 &#176;C for 24 h. The powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) and Rietveld refinement studies indicate that the compounds stabilize in  P  63 space group (no. 173). The refinement results were also rationalized employing Raman spectroscopic studies.The compounds were found to be SHG active and shows a weak ferroelectric behaviour. The co&#8208;substitution of Co  2+  and Fe  3+  in the structure gives rise to a weak ferromagnetic behaviour to the compound, BaCo  0.75  Si  0.75  Fe  0.5  O  4  , making it a multiferroic material. The optical studies on the prepared compounds exhibited blue color (Co  2+  in T  d  geometry); purple color (Ni  2+  in T  d  geometry) and simultaneous substitution of Co  2+  and Fe  3+  gives rise to blue&#8208;green color due to metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (MMCT) effect.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Dynamic ion speciation during hydrolysis of aryltrifluoroborates</title>
      <dc:description>Organotrifluoroborates serve as a coupling partner during transmetallation in the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction but require hydrolysis prior to the coupling reaction. Their anionic nature allows study of their hydrolysis by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) by real&#8208;time monitoring, complemented by pH analysis. Induction periods varied according to the borates employed, and a dynamic series of equilibria for numerous ions was observed during hydrolysis. We found that the induction periods and reaction rates were sensitive to the R group of the borates, the shape of reaction vessel, and stir rate.</dc:description>

      <title>Rational Design of High Relaxivity EuII&#8208;Based Contrast Agents for Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Low&#8208;Oxygen Environments</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8208;based contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging present a promising avenue to image hypoxia. Eu  II  &#8208;based contrast agents have a unique biologically relevant redox couple, Eu  II/III  , that distinguishes this metal for use in hypoxia imaging. To that end, we investigated a strategy to enhance the contrast&#8208;enhancing capabilities of Eu  II  &#8208;based cryptates in magnetic resonance imaging by controlling rotational dynamics. Two dimetallic, Eu  II  &#8208;containing cryptates were synthesized to test the efficacy of rigid versus flexible coupling strategies. A flexible strategy to dimerization led to a modest (114%) increase in contrast enhancement per Eu ion (60 MHz, 298 K), but a rigid linking strategy led to an excellent (186%) increase in contrast enhancement despite having the smaller molecular mass of the two dimetallic complexes. We envision the rigid linking strategy to be useful in the future design of potent Eu  II  &#8208;based contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A Zr&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework has been synthesized and employed as a catalyst for photochemical carbon dioxide reduction coupled with water oxidation. The catalyst shows significant carbon dioxide reduction property with concomitant water oxidation. The catalyst has broadband visible light as well as UV light absorption property, which is further confirmed from electronic absorption spectroscopy. We have obtained formic acid as the only reduced product from carbon dioxide with a TOF of 0.69 h  &#8208;1  and oxygen with a TOF of 0.54 h  &#8208;1  . No external photosensitizer is used and the ligand itself acts as the light harvester.

      <title>Effect of Stereochemistry on the Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly Chirality and Gelation Property</title>
      <dc:description>Although chiral nanostructures have been fabricated at various structural levels, the transfer and amplification of chirality from molecules to supramolecular self&#8208;assemblies are still puzzling, especially for heterochiral molecules. Herein, four series of C2&#8208;symmetrical dipeptide&#8208;based derivatives bearing various amino acid sequences and different chiralities are designed and synthesized.  The transcription and amplification of molecular chirality to supramolecular assemblies are achieved. The results show that the supramolecular chirality is only determined by the amino acid adjacent to the benzene core and irrespective of the absolute configuration of C&#8208;terminal amino acid.  In addition, the molecular chirality also has a significant influence on their gelation behaviors. For the diphenylalanine&#8208;based gelators, the homochiral gelators can be gelled through conventional heating&#8208;cooling process, while heterochiral gelators form translucent stable gels under sonication. And the racemic gels possess higher mechanical properties than that of pure enantiomers. All these results contribute to an increasing knowledge over control the generation of specific chiral supramolecular structures and the development of new optimized strategies to achieve functional supramolecular organogel through heterochiral and racemic systems.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Bacterial biofilms are a serious global health concern, often responsible for persistent infections. New strategies to prevent and treat bacterial infections via eradication of the biofilms are urgently needed. A novel ruthenium&#8208;based compound was reported in this study that functions as both a boronic acid&#8208;decorated photosensitizer (PS) and a light&#8208;triggered nitric oxide (NO) releasing agent.

And it is highly potent to eradicate  P. aeruginosa  biofilms via the simultaneous release of NO as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS), which is more effective than clinical antibiotics tobramycin. The compound also has excellent bacterial specificity and shows no significant cytotoxicity to human cells.

      <dc:description>Herein, we report synthesis, electrochemical and photophysical properties of aromatic hydrocarbons having one and two dimesitylborylethynyl peripherals&#160;  1  &#160;and&#160;  2  . The mono&#8208; (  1  ) and di&#8208;boryl compounds (  2  ) readily prepared by nucleophilic substitution reaction are fairly stable to air and moisture in the solid&#8208;state. The inserted ethynediyl (C &#8801;C) spacer cancels steric hindrance between the bulky dimesitylboryl groups and the aromatic rings, leading to effective&#160; &#960; &#8208;conjugation over the B &#8208; C &#8801; C &#8208;Ar linkages as revealed by cyclic voltammetry. Despite the small structural differences, photophysical properties of the benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene derivatives were different. Virtually no emission was observed for the benzene derivatives, whereas the anthracene derivatives emitted with high quantum yields both in solution and solid states. Notably, the naphthalene derivatives showed aggregation&#8208;induced emission behavior. Unlike common sterically congested triarylborane derivatives reported so far, the anthracene derivatives showed&#160; &#960; &#8208; &#960; * type absorption and emission bands, which derived from the efficient intramolecular orbital interactions between the boron centers and the anthracene moieties as supported by the density functional calculations.

      <dc:description>New drugs aimed at novel targets are urgently needed to combat the increasing rate of drug resistant tuberculosis (TB). Here, the National Cancer Institute Developmental Therapeutic Program (NCI&#8208;DTP) chemical library was screened against a promising new target, ketol&#8208;acid reductoisomerase (KARI), the second enzyme in the branched chain amino acid (BCAA) biosynthesis pathway. From this library, 6&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;methylthiazolo[4,5&#8208;  d  ]pyrimidine&#8208;5,7(4  H  ,6  H  )&#8208;dione (NSC116565) was identified as a potent time&#8208;dependent inhibitor of  Mycobacterium tuberculosis  (  Mt  ) KARI with a K  i  of 95.4 nM. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) studies showed that this inhibitor binds to Mt KARI in the presence and absence of the co&#8208;factor, NADPH, which was confirmed by crystal structures of the compound in complex with the closely related Staphylococcus aureus (  Sa  ) KARI. We have also shown that NSC116565 inhibits the growth of H37Ra and H37Rv strains of Mt with MIC  50  values of 2.93 &#181;M and 6.06 &#181;M, respectively. These results further validate KARI as a TB drug target and show that NSC116565 is a promising lead for anti&#8208;TB drug development.</dc:description>

      <title>Lewis Acidic Boranes, Lewis Bases, and Equilibrium Constants: A Reliable Scaffold for a Quantitative Lewis Acidity/Basicity Scale</title>
      <dc:description>In this study, we developed a quantitative Lewis acidity/basicity scale toward boron&#8208;centered Lewis acids based on a set of 90 experimental equilibrium constants for the reactions of triarylboranes with various O&#8208;, N&#8208;, S&#8208;, and P&#8208;centered Lewis bases in dichloromethane at 20 &#176;C. Analysis with the linear&#8208;free energy relationship lg  K  B  =  LA  B  +  LB  B  allows to calculate equilibrium constants  K  B  for any type of borane/Lewis base combination by the sum of two descriptors, one for Lewis acidity (  LA  B  ) and one for Lewis basicity (  LB  B  ). The resulting Lewis acidity/basicity scale is independent of fixed reference acids/bases and valid toward various types of trivalent boron&#8208;centered Lewis acids. We demonstrate that the newly developed Lewis acidity/basicity scale is easily extendable through linear relationships with quantum&#8208;chemically calculated or common physical&#8208;organic descriptors and known thermodynamic data (&#916;  H  BF3  ). Furthermore, we show that this experimental platform can be utilized for the rational development of borane&#8208;catalyzed reactions.</dc:description>

      <title>How does bridging core modification alter the photovoltaic characteristics of triphenylamine&#8208;based hole transport materials? Theoretical understanding and prediction</title>
      <dc:description>Perovskite solar cells have gained immense interest of researchers owing to their high photophysical properties, low&#8208;cost production, and high power conversion efficiencies. Hole transport materials (HTMs) play a dominant role in enhancing the power conversion efficiencies (PCE), and long length diffusion of hole and electron in perovskite solar cells.

In this work, &#960;&#8208;linker modification of recently synthesized H&#8208;Bi molecule (  R  ) is done with novel &#960;&#8208;linkers. After structural modifications, ten novel HTMs (  HB1&#8208;HB10  ) having D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D backbone have been obtained.

In addition, different geometric parameters are also examined with assist of density functional theory and time dependent&#8208;density functional theory. All designed molecules exhibit narrow HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap (E  g  =2.82&#8208;2.99 eV) as compared to R molecule (E  g  =3.05 eV). Designed molecules expressed red&#8208;shifting in absorption spectra with low values of excitation energy which in return offer high power conversion efficiencies.&#160;Results of all analysis advocate that these novel designed HTMs are ideal aspirant for construction of future high performance perovskite solar cells.</dc:description>

      <title>Doubling F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer Efficiency in Proteins with Extrinsic Thioamide Probes: Implications to Thiomodified Nucleobases</title>
      <dc:description>Designing potential protein&#8208;ligand pair is pivotal not only to track protein structure, dynamics but also to assist in atomistic understanding of drug delivery. Here we report the potentiality of a small model thioamide probe that can be used to study albumin proteins. Monitoring F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) dynamics with the help of fluorescence spectroscopic techniques, we observed two&#8208;fold enhancement in the FRET efficiency in the case of 2&#8208;Thiopyridone (2TPY) compared to its amide analog. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation depicts the relative position of the free energy minima to be quite stable in case of 2TPY via non&#8208;covalent interactions with sulfur which helps for enhancement in the FRET efficiency. Finally, we showed its application by pairing thiouracils with protein. We found that site&#8208;selective sulfur atom substitution approach and non&#8208;covalent interactions with sulfur can substantially enhance the FRET efficiency which can be a potential avenue to explore for designing FRET probes to study structure and dynamics of biomolecules.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease (AD) is one of the most common multifactorial diseases characterized by a range of abnormal molecular processes such as the accumulation of extracellular plaques containing the amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptides and dyshomeostasis of copper in the brain. Herein, we investigate the effect of Cu(II) ions on the aggregation of A&#946;1&#8208;40, and A&#946;4&#8208;40, representing two most prevalent families of A&#946; peptides, full length and N&#8208;truncated ones. Both families are similarly abundant in healthy and AD brains.

The addition of either A&#946;4&#8208;40 or substoichiometric Cu(II) ions affected the aggregation profile of A&#946;1&#8208;40, by yielding shorter and thicker fibrils. The similarity of these two effects can be attributed to the increase of positive charge at the A&#946; N&#8208;terminus, which is caused either by Cu(II) complexation or N&#8208;truncation at position 4.

      <dc:description>Chemodivergent cross&#8208;couplings are those in which either one of two (or more) potentially reactive functional groups can be made to react based on choice of conditions. In particular, this review focuses on cross&#8208;couplings involving two different (pseudo)halides that can compete for the role of the electrophilic coupling partner. The discussion is primarily organized by pairs of electrophiles including chloride vs. triflate, bromide vs. triflate, chloride vs. tosylate, and halide vs. halide. Some common themes emerge regarding the origin of selectivity control. These include catalyst ligation state and solvent polarity or coordinating ability. However, in many cases, further systematic studies will be necessary to deconvolute the influences of metal identity, ligand, solvent, additives, nucleophilic coupling partner, and other factors on chemoselectivity.</dc:description>

antidote to counteract the in vivo biological effects of phencyclidine. We investigate the binding

of CB[8] and its derivative Me4CB[8] toward ten drugs of abuse (3 &#8211; 9, 12 &#8211;14) by a combination

of 1H NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry in phosphate buffered water. We

find that the cavity of CB[8] and Me4CB[8] are able to encapsulate the 1&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;arylcyclohexane

ring system of phencyclidine (PCP) and ketamine as well as the morphinan skeleton

of morphine and hydromorphone with Kd values &#8804; 50 nM. In vitro cytotoxicity (MTS metabolic

and adenylate kinase cell death assays in HEK293 and HEPG2 cells) and in vivo maximum

tolerated dose studies (Swiss Webster mice) which were performed for Me4CB[8] indicated good

tolerability. The tightest host&#8226;guest pair (Me4CB[8]&#8226;PCP; Kd = 2 nM) was advanced to in vivo

efficacy studies. The results of open field tests demonstrate that pretreatment of mice with

Me4CB[8] prevents subsequent hyperlocomotion induction by PCP and also that treatment of

animals previously dosed with PCP with Me4CB[8] significantly reduces the locomotion levels.</dc:description>

Complexes  1  and  2  crystallized in ordered phases in the centrosymmetric  I  2/  m  space group at 100 K, whereas they crystallized in disordered phases in the non&#8208;symmetric  I  2 space group at 300 K. The 60&#176; step rotation disordering of the abco ligands was observed in the electron density maps of  1  and  2  , which was consistent with the transition enthalpies estimated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Gradual phase transitions were observed for  1  and  2  by DSC and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) at approximately 225 K. The inversion&#8208;symmetry disordering was likely induced by the local pseudo&#8208;symmetry of the abco ligands, increasing from trigonal to hexagonal and the increased steric repulsion pathways among them.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Urchin&#8208;type cobalt phosphide microparticles assembled by nanorod is encapsulated in graphene framework membrane (CoP@GF), and used as a binder&#8208;free electrode for alkali metal ion batteries. Electrochemical measurements indicate that this membrane exhibits enhanced reversible lithium, sodium, and potassium storage capabilities. Moreover, the energy storage properties of CoP@GF electrodes in alkali metal ion batteries display an order of Li &gt; Na &gt; K. DFT calculations on adsorption energy of CoP surfaces for Li, Na, and K indicated that CoP surfaces is more favorable to transfer electrons to Li atoms than Na and K, and the surface reactivity can be ordered as Li&#8208;CoP &gt; Na&#8208;CoP &gt; K&#8208;CoP, thus CoP@GF exhibit better storage capacity for lithium. This work provides experimental and theoretical basis for understand the electrochemical performance of cobalt phosphide&#8208;based membrane for alkali metal ion batteries.</dc:description>

DFT calculations on adsorption energy of CoP surfaces for Li, Na, and K indicated that CoP surfaces is more favorable to transfer electrons to Li atoms than Na and K, and the surface reactivity can be ordered as Li&#8208;CoP &amp;gt; Na&#8208;CoP &amp;gt; K&#8208;CoP, thus CoP@GF exhibit better storage capacity for lithium. This work provides experimental and theoretical basis for understand the electrochemical performance of cobalt phosphide&#8208;based membrane for alkali metal ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Significantly, the formation of  2  can not only effectively prevent the cluster  1  from aggregation, but also greatly enhance its solubility and adhesion to the substrate.

      <title>Light&#8208;Driven Syngas Production over Defective ZnIn2S4 Nanosheets</title>
      <dc:description>Photocatalytic syngas (CO and H2) production with CO2 as gas source not only ameliorates greenhouse effect, but also produces valuable chemical feedstocks. However, traditional photocatalytic system requires noble metal or suffers from low yield. Here, we demonstrate that S vacancies ZnIn2S4 (VS&#8208;ZnIn2S4) nanosheets are an ideal photocatalyst to drive CO2 reduction into syngas. It is found that building S vacancies can endow ZnIn2S4 with stronger photoabsorption, efficient electron&#8208;hole separation, and larger CO2 adsorption, finally promoting both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The syngas yield of CO and H2 is therefore significantly increased. In contrast to pristine ZnIn2S4, the syngas yield over VS&#8208;ZnIn2S4 can be improved by roughly ~4.73 times and the CO/H2 ratio is modified from 1:4.18 to 1:1. Total amount of syngas after 12 h photocatalysis is as high as 63.20 mmol g&#8211;1 without use of any noble metals, which is even higher than those of traditional noble metal based catalysts in the reported literatures. This work demonstrates the critical role of S vacancies in mediating catalytic activity and selectivity, and highlights the attractive ability of defective ZnIn2S4 for light&#8208;driven syngas production.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Carbonized polymer dots (CPDs), a peculiar type of Carbon dots, show extremely high quantum yields, making them very attractive nanostructures for application in optics and biophotonics. The origin of CPD strong photoluminescence resides in a complicated interplay of several radiative mechanisms. To understand the correlation between CPD processing and properties, we have studied the early stage formation of carbonized polymer dots. In the synthesis, citric acid monohydrate and  2&#8208;Amino&#8208;2&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)propane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diol  have been thermally degraded at 180&#176;C. The use of an oil bath instead of a more traditional hydrothermal reactor has allowed to monitor the CPD properties at different reactions times. Transmission electron microscopy, time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence, nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared and Raman spectroscopy have revealed the formation of polymeric species with amide and ester bonds. Quantum chemistry calculations has been employed to investigate the origin of CPD electronic transitions. At short reaction times, amorphous C&#8208;dots with 80% quantum yield, have been obtained.</dc:description>
