      <title>Large&#8208;Amplitude Thermal Vibration&#8208;Coupled Valence Tautomeric Transition Observed in a Conductive One&#8208;Dimensional Rhodium&#8211;Dioxolene Complex</title>
      <dc:description>The exploration of dynamic molecular crystals is a fascinating theme for materials scientists owing to their fundamental science and potential application to molecular devices. Herein, we report a one&#8208;dimensional (1D) rhodium&#8211;dioxolene complex that exhibits drastic changes in properties with the phase transition. The X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) reveals that the room&#8208;temperature (RT) phase is in a mixed&#8208;valence state, and therefore, the drastic changes originate from the mixed&#8208;valence state appearing in the RT phase. Another notable feature is that the mean square displacements of the rhodium atoms along the 1D chain dramatically increase in the RT phase, indicating a large&#8208;amplitude vibration of the Rh&#8211;Rh bonds. From these results, we propose a possible mechanism for the appearance of the mixed&#8208;valence state in the RT phase based on the thermal electron transfer from the 1D d&#8208;band to the semiquinonato &#960;* orbital coupled with the large&#8208;amplitude vibration of the Rh&#8211;Rh bonds.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The exploration of dynamic molecular crystals is a fascinating theme for materials scientists owing to their fundamental science and potential application to molecular devices. Herein, we report a one&#8208;dimensional (1D) rhodium&#8211;dioxolene complex that exhibits drastic changes in properties with the phase transition. The X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) reveals that the room&#8208;temperature (RT) phase is in a mixed&#8208;valence state, and therefore, the drastic changes originate from the mixed&#8208;valence state appearing in the RT phase. Another notable feature is that the mean square displacements of the rhodium atoms along the 1D chain dramatically increase in the RT phase, indicating a large&#8208;amplitude vibration of the Rh&#8211;Rh bonds. From these results, we propose a possible mechanism for the appearance of the mixed&#8208;valence state in the RT phase based on the thermal electron transfer from the 1D d&#8208;band to the semiquinonato &#960;* orbital coupled with the large&#8208;amplitude vibration of the Rh&#8211;Rh bonds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>General synthesis of sulfonate&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework derived composite of MxSy@N/S doped carbon for high&#8208;performance lithium/sodium ion batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, a general and simple strategy has been realized for preparing metal sulfide (MxSy) nanoparticles immobilized into N/S co&#8208;doped carbon (NSC) via an one&#8208;step pyrolysis method for the first time, in which the organic ligand 1, 5&#8208;naphthalenedisulfonic acid in metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) precursor is as a sulfur source, and metal ions are in situ sulfurized to form MxSy nanoparticles, results in formation of MxSy/NSC (M=Fe, Co, Cu, Ni, Mn, Zn) composites. Benefiting from the MxSy nanoparticles and conductive carbon, a synergistic effect of the composite has been achieved. For instance, the composite of Fe7S8/NSC as an anode displays excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability in lithium/sodium ion batteries. At 5 A g&#8208;1, large capacities of 645 mA h g&#8208;1 and 426.6 mA h g&#8208;1 can be retained after 1500 cycles for lithium&#8208;ion battery and after 1000 cycles for sodium&#8208;ion battery, respectively.</dc:description>

      <title>Electrophilic and Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitutions are Mechanistically Similar with Opposite Polarity</title>
      <dc:description>
Oranges and lemons: The analogy between the mechanisms of electrophilic and nucleophilic aromatic substitution is discussed and supported by several synthetic examples. These important processes are in an Umpolung relationship.







Abstract
Confrontation of the recently formulated general mechanism of nucleophilic substitution in electron&#8208;deficient arenes with the well&#8208;known mechanism of electrophilic substitution revealed that these fundamental processes are mechanistically identical but proceed according to opposite polarity&#8212;an Umpolung relation. In this viewpoint this apparently controversial concept is supported by discussion of a variety of experimental results.

      <title>The Unexpected Base&#8208;pairing Behavior of Cyanuric Acid in RNA and Ribose versus Cyanuric Acid Induced Helicene Assembly of Nucleic Acids: Implications for the pre&#8208;RNA Paradigm.</title>
      <dc:description>Cyanuric acid heterocycle (CA) forms supramolecular structures with adenine nucleobases/nucleosides and oligonucleotides leading to speculation that they can act as forerunners to RNA. Herein, we studied the assembly behavior of RNA containing CA and CA&#8208;ribose nucleoside. Contrary to previous reports, CA in RNA, and as the ribonucleoside, leads to destabilization of supramolecular assemblies, which led to reevaluation of the CA&#8208;adenine hexameric rosette structure. We propose an unprecedented non&#8208;covalent supramolecular helicene structure to account for the striking difference in behavior, which has implications for novel paradigms for reorganizing the structures of nucleic acids, synthesis of long helicenes, and pre&#8208;RNA world paradigms. The results caution against extrapolating the self&#8208;assembly behavior of individual heterocycles from the level of monomers to oligomers &#8211; since the base&#8208;paring properties of (non)canonical nucleobases are impacted by the type of oligomeric backbone to which they are attached.</dc:description>

      <title>Noncovalent Helicene Structure between Nucleic Acids and Cyanuric Acid</title>
      <dc:description>Cyanuric acid (CA), a triazine heterocycle, is extensively utilized for noncovalent self&#8208;assembly. The association between poly(adenine) and CA into micron&#8208;length bers was a remarkable observation made by Sleiman and coworkers who proposed that adenine and CA adopt a hexameric rosette configuration in analogy with previously reported structures for CA assemblies. However, recent experimental observations from the Krishnamurthy group led to a reevaluation of the hexameric rosette model, wherein they have proposed a hydrogen&#8208;bonded helicene model as an alternative. Our molecular dynamics simulations show that the hexad model is indeed unlikely and that this novel noncovalent helicene geometry, where the adenine and CA bases form an extended helical hydrogen bond network across the system, is a more probable structural motif. The existence of noncovalent helicene compounds may have wide&#8208;ranging applications in DNA nanotechnology and helicene

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cyanuric acid (CA), a triazine heterocycle, is extensively utilized for noncovalent self&#8208;assembly. The association between poly(adenine) and CA into micron&#8208;length bers was a remarkable observation made by Sleiman and coworkers who proposed that adenine and CA adopt a hexameric rosette configuration in analogy with previously reported structures for CA assemblies. However, recent experimental observations from the Krishnamurthy group led to a reevaluation of the hexameric rosette model, wherein they have proposed a hydrogen&#8208;bonded helicene model as an alternative. Our molecular dynamics simulations show that the hexad model is indeed unlikely and that this novel noncovalent helicene geometry, where the adenine and CA bases form an extended helical hydrogen bond network across the system, is a more probable structural motif. The existence of noncovalent helicene compounds may have wide&#8208;ranging applications in DNA nanotechnology and helicene

      <title>Mechanochemically triggered topology changes in expanded porphyrins</title>
      <dc:description>A hitherto unexplored class of molecules for molecular force probe applications are expanded porphyrins. This work proves mechanical force to be an effective stimulus to trigger the interconversion between H&#252;ckel and M&#246;bius topologies in [28]hexaphyrin, making these expanded porphyrins suitable to act as conformational mechanophores operating at mild ( sub 1nN) force conditions. A straightforward approach based on distance matrices is proposed for the selection of pulling scenarios that promote either the most stable H&#252;ckel topology or the three lowest lying M&#246;bius topologies. This approach is supported by means of quantum mechanochemical calculations. Force distribution analyses reveal that [28]hexaphyrin selectively allocates the external mechanical energy to molecular regions that trigger H&#252;ckel&#8208;M&#246;bius interconversions, explaining why certain pulling scenarios favor the H&#252;ckel two&#8208;sided topology and others favor M&#246;bius single&#8208;sided topologies. The meso &#8208;substitution pattern on [28]hexaphyrin determines whether the energy difference between the different topologies can be overcome by mechanical activation.</dc:description>

      <title>Partnering a three&#8208;coordinate gallium cation with a hydroborate counter&#8208;ion for the catalytic hydrosilylation of CO2</title>
      <dc:description>A novel &#946;&#8208;diketiminate stabilized gallium hydride, (DippL)Ga(Ad)H (where (DippL) = {HC(MeCDippN)2}, Dipp = 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl and Ad = 1&#8208;adamantyl), has been synthesized and shown to undergo insertion of CO2&#160;into the Ga&#8208;H bond under mild conditions. In this case, treatment of the resulting &#954;1&#8208;formate complex with Et3SiH does not lead to regeneration of the hydride precursor. However, when combined with B(C6F5)3, (DippL)Ga(Ad)H catalyses the reductive hydrosilylation of CO2&#160;. Under stoichiometric conditions, the addition of one equivalent of B(C6F5)3&#160;to (DippL)Ga(Ad)H leads to the formation of a 3&#8208;coordinate cationic gallane complex, partnered with a hydroborate anion, [(DippL)Ga(Ad)][HB(C6F5)3]. This complex rapidly hydrometallates carbon dioxide and catalyses the selective reduction of CO2&#160;to the formaldehyde oxidation level in the presence of Et3SiH (yielding H2C(OSiEt3)2). When catalysis is undertaken in the presence of excess B(C6F5)3, appreciable enhancement in the activity of the system is observed, with a corresponding reduction in selectivity. While this system represents proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept in CO2&#160;hydrosilylation by a gallium hydride system, the TOF values obtained are relatively modest (max. 10 h&#8208;1). This is attributed to the strength of binding of the formatoborate anion to the Ga centre in the intermediate (DippL)Ga(Ad){HC(O)OB(C6F5)3}, and the correspondingly slow rate of the turnover&#8208;limiting hydrosilylation step. In turn, this strength of binding can be related to the relatively high Lewis acidity measured for the [(DippL)Ga(Ad)]+&#160;cation (AN = 69.8).</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The selectivity and rate enhancement of bifunctional hydrogen bond donor&#8208;catalyzed Diels&#8208;Alder reactions between cyclopentadiene and acrolein were quantum chemically studied using density functional theory in combination with coupled&#8208;cluster theory.

Our activation strain and Kohn&#8208;Sham molecular orbital analyses uncover that these organocatalysts enhance the Diels&#8208;Alder reactivity by reducing the Pauli repulsion between the closed&#8208;shell filled&#160; &#960; &#8208;orbitals of the diene and dienophile, by polarizing the&#160; &#960; &#8208;orbitals away from the reactive center and not by making the orbital interactions between the reactants stronger. In addition, we establish that the unprecedented&#160;  exo  &#160;selectivity of the hydrogen bond donor&#8208;catalyzed Diels&#8208;Alder reactions is directly related to the larger degree of asynchronicity along this reaction pathway, which is manifested in a relief of destabilizing activation strain and Pauli repulsion.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
In electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, nanostructured materials with unique morphological, electronic and chemical surface properties could greatly improve their catalytic activity, stability and selectivity for CO2 reduction reaction (CDRR) products. In the Minireview on page&#8197;14024&#8197;ff., Liu et&#8197;al. provide readers with the general concepts and views of nanostructured materials as electrocatalysts in line with their morphology (0D, 1D, 2D, and multi&#8208;component nanostructures) for CDRR, and the main factors affecting the selectivity of CO2 reduction products. The current reaction mechanisms and reaction pathways for CO2 are also summarized. The challenges and development prospects of nanostructured materials in the field of electrocatalysis are also discussed.

      <title>Synergetic effect of Mo6 clusters and gold nanoparticles on photophysical properties of both components</title>

      <title>An Aldehyde Responsive, Cleavable Linker for Glucose Responsive Insulins</title>
      <dc:description>A glucose responsive insulin (GRI) that responds to changes&#160; in blood glucose concentrations&#160;has&#160;remained an elusive goal. Here we describe the development of glucose cleavable linkers based on hydrazone and&#160;thiazolidine structures. We developed linkers withlow levels of spontaneous hydrolysis but increased level of hydrolysis with rising concentrations of glucose, which demonstrated their glucose responsiveness&#160; in vitro . Lipidated hydrazones and thiazolidines were conjugated to the LysB29 side&#8208;chain of HI by pH&#8208;controlled acylations providing GRIs with glucose responsiveness confirmed&#160; in vitro for thiazolidines. Clamp studies showed increased glucose infusion at hyperglycemic conditions for one GRI indicative of a true glucose response. The glucose responsive cleavable linker in these GRIs allow changes in glucose levels to drive the release of active insulin from a circulating depot. We have demonstrated an unprecedented, chemically responsive linker concept for biopharmaceuticals.</dc:description>

      <title>N,S&#8208;Codoped Porous Carbon Nanofiber Films Derived from Fullerenes (C60) as Efficient Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Reduction and Zn&#8208;Air Battery</title>
      <dc:description>Developing highly efficient metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has attracted great attention for creation of electrochemical energy devices. In this study, one&#8208;dimensional (1D) fullerene nanofibers prepared from liquid&#8208;liquid interfacial precipitation were first fabricated into fullerene&#8208;derived carbon nanofiber films (FCNFs) via a simple filtration procedure, and then pyrolysis of FCNFs in the presence of ammonia and sulfur produced N&#8208; and S&#8208; co&#8208;doped porous carbon nanofiber films (N,S&#8208;PCNFs). As excellent metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for ORR, N,S&#8208;PCNFs exhibit remarkable catalytic activity, superior stability and excellent methanol tolerance in both alkaline and acidic solution. Such a high ORR performance benefits from the robust porous nanofiber network structure with high concentrations of active N&#8208; and S&#8208; groups and abundant defects. Notably, when N,S&#8208;PCNFs are practically used as catalysts in a Zn&#8208;air battery, a high power density and a large operating voltage have been achieved, a performance comparable to that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst. This work presents a facile strategy for the creation of a new class of energy nanomaterials based on fullerenes, demonstrating their practical uses in electrocatalytic ORR processes and Zn&#8208;air batteries.</dc:description>

      <title>Organocatalytic Cascade Reactions for the Diversification of Thiopyrano&#8208;Piperidone Fused Rings via Trienamine Activation.</title>
      <dc:description>We report an Aminocatalytic privileged Diversity&#8208;Oriented Synthesis (ApDOS) strategy via trienamine catalysis for the construction of diverse and complex thiopyrans&#8208;piperidone fused rings through a thia&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder/nucleophilic ring closing sequence by using dithioamides as activated heterodienophiles. Following this strategy, a super cascade reaction to assemble nine fused rings can be achieved by employing a bis&#8208;dithioamide. Additionally, by linking an indole moiety on the dithioamide, a Pictet&#8208;Spengler type reaction can be promoted once the cascade sequence has been achieved, leading to more complex penta&#8208; hexa&#8208; and heptacyclic fused ring derivatives in a one&#8208;pot process. This investigation, open new perspectives for the synthesis of a new class of complex and diverse thiopyrans, which contribute to populate new relevant regions in the chemical space.</dc:description>

      <title>Selective formation of polyaniline confined in the nanopores of a metal&#8211;organic framework for supercapacitors</title>
      <dc:description>In this study, a strategy that can result in the polyaniline (PANI) solely confined within the nanopores of a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) without forming obvious bulk PANI between MOF crystals is developed. A water&#8208;stable zirconium&#8208;based MOF, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  , is selected as the MOF material. The polymerization of aniline is initiated in the acidic suspension of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  nanocrystals in the presence of excess poly(sodium 4&#8208;styrenesulfonate) (PSS). Since the pore size of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  is too small to enable the insertion of the bulky PSS, the quick formation of pore&#8208;confined solid PANI and the slower formation of well dispersed PANI:PSS occur within the MOF crystals and in the bulk solution, respectively. By taking advantage of the resulting homogeneous PANI:PSS polymer solution, the bulk PANI:PSS can be removed from the PANI/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  solid by successive washing the sample with fresh acidic solutions through centrifugation. As this is the first time reporting the PANI solely confined in the pores of a MOF, as a demonstration, the obtained PANI/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  composite material is applied as the electrode material for supercapacitors. The PANI/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  thin films exhibit a pseudocapacitive electrochemical characteristic, and their resulting electrochemical activity and charge&#8208;storage capacities are remarkably higher than those of the bulk PANI thin films.</dc:description>

      <title>Self&#8208;Assembly Approach towards MoS2&#8208;Embedded Hierarchical Porous Carbons for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>Transition metal&#8211;based nanoparticle&#8208;embedded carbon materials have received increasing attention for constructing next&#8208;generation electrochemical catalysts for energy storage and conversion. However, designing hybrid carbon materials with controllable hierarchical micro/mesoporous structures, excellent dispersion of metal nanoparticles, and multiple heteroatom&#8208;doping remains challenging. Here, a novel pyridinium&#8208;containing ionic hypercrosslinked micellar frameworks (IHMFs) prepared from the core&#8211;shell unimicelle of  s  &#8208;poly(tert&#8208;butyl acrylate)&#8208;  b  &#8208;poly(4&#8208;bromomethyl) styrene (  s  &#8208;PtBA&#8208;  b  &#8208;PBMS) and linear poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine) were used as self&#8208;sacrificial templates for confined growth of molybdenum disulfide (MoS  2  ) inside cationic IHMFs through electrostatic interaction. After pyrolysis, MoS  2  &#8208;anchored nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbons possessing tunable hierarchical micro/mesoporous structures and favorable distributions of MoS  2  nanoparticles exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction as well as small Tafel slope of 66.7 mV dec  &#8722;1  , low onset potential, and excellent cycling stability under acidic condition. Crucially, hierarchical micro/mesoporous structure and high surface area could boost their catalytic hydrogen evolution performance. Our approach provides a novel route for preparation of micro/mesoporous hybrid carbon materials with confined transition metal nanoparticles for electrochemical energy conversion.</dc:description>

      <title>Inherent Impurities in Graphene/Polylactic Acid Filament Strongly Influence on the Capacitive Performance of 3D&#8208;Printed Electrode</title>
      <dc:description>
Positive impurities: Inherent impurities, TiO2 and Fe3O4 were found in commercial conductive graphene/PLA filaments used in the printing of 3D&#8208;electrodes by a fused deposition modeling technique. These additives contributed towards pseudocapacitive charge storage kinetics of the 3D&#8208;printed electrodes and dramatically enhanced the overall capacitance.







Abstract
Additive manufacturing or 3D&#8208;printing have become promising fabrication techniques in the field of electrochemical energy storage applications such as supercapacitors, and batteries. Of late, a commercially available graphene/polylactic acid (PLA) filament has been commonly used for Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D&#8208;printing in the fabrication of electrodes for supercapacitors and Li&#8208;ion batteries. This graphene/PLA filament contains metal&#8208;based impurities such as titanium oxide and iron oxide. In this study, we show a strong influence of inherent impurities in the graphene/PLA filament for supercapacitor applications. A 3D&#8208;printed electrode is prepared and subsequently thermally activated for electrochemical measurement. A deep insight has been taken to look into the pseudocapacitive contribution from the metal&#8208;based impurities which significantly enhanced the overall capacitance of the 3D&#8208;printed graphene/PLA electrode. A systematic approach has been shown to remove the impurities from the printed electrodes. This has a broad implication on the interpretation of the capacitance of 3D&#8208;printed composites.

      <title>Structural Motifs of Alkali Metal Superbases in Non&#8208;coordinating Solvents</title>
      <dc:description>
Navigating in treacherous but treasure&#8208;laden seas where alkyllithium and potassium alkoxides were discovered by Lochmann and Schlosser mix. Little is known about the uncharted areas away from the well&#8208;known coastal regions of the starting materials. Many molecular vessels were precipitated and lost here. Progress was finally made by careful hopping from molecular island to island.







Abstract
Lochmann&#8211;Schlosser superbases (LSB) are a standard reagent in synthetic chemistry to achieve an exchange of a proton on an organic framework with an alkali metal cation, which in turn can be replaced by a wide range of electrophilic groups. In standard examples, the deprotonating reagent consists of an equimolar mixture of n&#8208;butyllithium and potassium t&#8208;butoxide. However, the nature of the reactive species could not be pinned down either for this composition or for similar mixtures with comparable high reactivity. Despite the poor solubility and the fierce reactivity, some insights into this mixture were achieved by some indirect results, comparison with chemically related systems, or skillful deductions. Recent results, mainly based on new soluble compounds, delivered structural evidence. These new insights lead to advanced and more detailed conclusions about the interplay of the involved components.

      <title>A Simple Route to the Synthesis of Pt Nanobars and the Mechanistic Understanding of Symmetry Reduction</title>
      <dc:description>Noble&#8208;metal nanocrystals with anisotropic shapes have received increasing interest owing to their unique properties. Here we report a facile route to the preparation of Pt nanobars with aspect ratios tunable up to 2.1 by simply reducing a Pt  (IV)  precursor in  N,N  &#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) at 160 &#176;C in the presence of poly (vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP). In addition to its commonly observed roles as a solvent and a reductant, DMF could also decompose to generate CO, a capping agent capable of selectively passivating Pt{100} facets to promote the formation of nanobars. The size and aspect ratio of the nanobars could be tuned by varying the amount of Pt  (IV)  precursor involved in the synthesis, as well as the concentration of PVP because of its dual roles as a stabilizer and a co&#8208;reductant.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Noble&#8208;metal nanocrystals with anisotropic shapes have received increasing interest owing to their unique properties.

      <title>Bone Tissue Disorders:&#160;Healing Through Coordination Chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>Osteoporosis, Paget&#8217;s disease and osteosarcoma are a few examples of bone tissue disorders that affect millions of people worldwide. These conditions can strictly limit the lifestyle of patients and may even lead to their demise. To prevent this or, at least, try to manage the situation, there are several treatments available on the market. Notwithstanding, research has been driven by the possibility to improve the existing therapies, as well as to find new approaches that could better respond to these diseases.

In this review it is shown the path through which, in recent years, coordination compounds have been prepared and manufactured to be applied in the management of bone tissue disorders. Starting with the design and preparation of the coordination compounds with various dimensionalities, two approaches have been used: (1) they are prepared as three&#8208;dimensional cages that can act as delivery systems for therapeutic substances, or (2) they are constructed/prepared from compounds with intrinsic therapeutic properties. Following this, several strategies have been explored to manufacture the effective delivery to the patients. The versatility of coordination compounds has allowed their use in the preparation of drug tablets, coatings for titanium implants, or even scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. In the end, it becomes clear that these compounds can be a valuable approach to reach a better treatment for bone tissue disorders. Nonetheless, along the road, a few bumps have appeared concerning the therapeutic profile, such as the effect of the structural arrangement or particle size.</dc:description>

      <title>Enhanced electron transfer and ion transport by binary and multidimensional CuCo2S4/Fe2O3 on carbon cloth for water oxidation</title>
      <dc:description>The behavior of electron transfer and ion transport plays a significant role in the electrocatalytic activity. However, the improvement of CuCo  2  S  4  electrocatalytic activity has been a difficult problem lacking of effective electron transfer and ion transport. Herein, the unique structure connects CuCo  2  S  4  nanosheets and carbon cloth (CC) with Fe  2  O  3  nanoparticles to form CuCo  2  S  4  /Fe  2  O  3  /CC. Compared with CuCo  2  S  4  /CC, the resistances of electron transfer and ion transport are decreased by 65% and 84% respectively. The electrochemical surface area of CuCo  2  S  4  /Fe  2  O  3  /CC is 2.76 times larger than that of CuCo  2  S  4  /CC due to the high double layer capacitance. For an oxygen evolution reaction, CuCo  2  S  4  /Fe  2  O  3  /CC can achieve an overpotential of 273 mV and a Tafel slope of 67 mV&#183;dec  &#8208;1  in alkaline solution.</dc:description>

      <title>A&#160;Fast, Green and General Route to Ketones from Amides and Organolithium Compounds under Aerobic Conditions: Synthetic and Mechanistic Aspects</title>
      <dc:description>We report that the nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction of aliphatic and (hetero)aromatic amides by organolithium reagents proceeds quickly (20 s reaction time), efficiently, and chemoselectively with a broad substrate scope in the environmentally responsible cyclopentyl methyl ether, at ambient temperature and under air, to provide ketones in up to 93% yield with an effective suppression of the notorious over&#8208;addition reaction. Detailed DFT calculations and NMR investigations support the experimental results. The described methodology was proven to be amenable to scale&#8208;up and recyclability protocols. Contrasting classical procedures carried out under inert atmospheres, this work lays the foundation for a profound paradigm shift of the reactivity of carboxylic acid amides with organolithiums, with ketones being straightforwardly obtained by simply combining the reagents under aerobic conditions and with no need of using previously modified or pre&#8208;activated amides, as recommended.</dc:description>

Non&#8208;covalent inhibitors of bacterial SA capable of reaching the submicromolar level are rarely reported.

      <title>Effect of gold(I) in the Room Temperature Phosphorescence of ethynylphenanthrene</title>
      <dc:description>The synthesis of two series of gold(I) complexes containing the general formulae PR  3  &#8208;Au&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;phenanthrene (PR  3  = PPh  3  (  1a  /  2a  ), PMe  3  (  1b  /  2b  ), PNaph  3  (  1c  /  2c  )) or (diphos)(Au&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;phenanthrene)  2  (diphos = 1,1&#8208;  bis  (diphenylphosphino)methane, dppm (  1d  /  2d  ); 1,4&#8208;  bis  (diphenylphosphino)butane, dppb (  1e  /  2e  )) have been synthesized. The two series differ on the position of the alkynyl substituent on the phenanthrene chromophore, being at the 9&#8208;position (9&#8208;ethynylphenanthrene) for the  L1  &#8208;series and at the 2&#8208;position (2&#8208;ethynylphenanthrene) for the  L2  &#8208;series. The compounds have been fully characterized by  1  H and  31  P NMR and IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction resolution in the case of compounds  1a  ,  1e  ,  2a  , and  2c  .
The emissive properties of the uncoordinated ligands and corresponding complexes have been studied in solution and within organic matrixes of different polarity (PMMA and Zeonex). We have observed room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) for all gold(I) complexes while only fluorescence can be detected for the pure organic chromophore. In particular, the  L2  &#8208;series present better luminescent properties regarding intensity of emission, quantum yields and RTP effect. Additionally, while the inclusion of all the compounds in organic matrixes induces an enhancement of the observed RTP due to the decrease in non&#8208;radiative deactivation, only the  L2  &#8208;series completely supress fluorescence giving rise to pure phosphorescent materials.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of two series of gold(I) complexes containing the general formulae PR  3  &#8208;Au&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;phenanthrene (PR  3  = PPh  3  (  1a  /  2a  ), PMe  3  (  1b  /  2b  ), PNaph  3  (  1c  /  2c  )) or (diphos)(Au&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;phenanthrene)  2  (diphos = 1,1&#8208;  bis  (diphenylphosphino)methane, dppm (  1d  /  2d  ); 1,4&#8208;  bis  (diphenylphosphino)butane, dppb (  1e  /  2e  )) have been synthesized. The two series differ on the position of the alkynyl substituent on the phenanthrene chromophore, being at the 9&#8208;position (9&#8208;ethynylphenanthrene) for the  L1  &#8208;series and at the 2&#8208;position (2&#8208;ethynylphenanthrene) for the  L2  &#8208;series. The compounds have been fully characterized by  1  H and  31  P NMR and IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction resolution in the case of compounds  1a  ,  1e  ,  2a  , and  2c  .
The emissive properties of the uncoordinated ligands and corresponding complexes have been studied in solution and within organic matrixes of different polarity (PMMA and Zeonex). We have observed room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) for all gold(I) complexes while only fluorescence can be detected for the pure organic chromophore. In particular, the  L2  &#8208;series present better luminescent properties regarding intensity of emission, quantum yields and RTP effect. Additionally, while the inclusion of all the compounds in organic matrixes induces an enhancement of the observed RTP due to the decrease in non&#8208;radiative deactivation, only the  L2  &#8208;series completely supress fluorescence giving rise to pure phosphorescent materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Molecular Imprints Frozen by Strong Intermolecular Interactions in Place of Cross&#8208;linking</title>
      <dc:description>A new way to freeze molecular imprints in a polymer material is reported. So far, molecular imprinted polymers (MIP) involve copolymerization of a functional monomer and large amounts of cross&#8208;linking agent that keeps the template shape memory in rigid molecular imprints. MIP materials are presently prepared without cross&#8208;linking agent. Stiff chains of polyaniline grafted on a solid support as a brush&#8208;like material achieve the necessary rigidity. Differential adsorption to imprinted and non&#8208;imprinted materials provides evidence of molecular imprints. A correct adsorption isotherm for mobile adsorbed layers (Volmer isotherm) is introduced instead of the popular but inadequate Langmuir isotherm. Non&#8208;selective adsorption is entropic, whereas adsorption to molecular imprints has an enthalpic contribution coming from specific interactions. Fast adsorption kinetics is a definite benefit with regards to applications such as chromatographic separations and chemical sensors.</dc:description>

      <title>Chemical and Genetic Studies on the Formation of Pyrrolones During the Biosynthesis of Cytochalasans</title>
      <dc:description>A key step during the biosynthesis of cytochalasans is a proposed Knoevenagel condensation to form the pyrrolone core, enabling the subsequent 4+2 cycloaddition reaction that results in the characteristic octahydroisoindolone motif of all cytochalasans. Here we investigate the role of the highly conserved alpha&#8208;beta &#8208;hydrolase enzymes PyiE and ORFZ during the biosynthesis of pyrichalasin H and the ACE1 metabolite respectively, using gene knockout and complementation techniques. Using synthetic aldehyde models we demonstrate that the Knoevenagel condensation proceeds spontaneously but results in the 1,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;one tautomer, rather than the required 1,5&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;one tautomer. Taken together our results suggest that the alpha&#8208;beta &#8208;hydrolase enzymes are essential for first ring cyclisation, but the precise nature of the intermediates remains to be determined .</dc:description>

      <title>Evaluation of the DNA Alkylation Property of a Chlorambucil&#8208;Conjugated Cyclic Pyrrole&#8211;Imidazole Polyamide</title>
      <dc:description>Hairpin pyrrole&#8211;imidazole polyamides (hPIPs) and their chlorambucil (Chb) conjugates (hPIP&#8211;Chbs) can alkylate DNA in a sequence&#8208;specific manner, and have been studied as anticancer drugs. Here we conjugated Chb to a cyclic PIP (cPIP), which is known to have a higher binding affinity than the corresponding hPIP, and investigated the DNA alkylation properties of the cPIP&#8211;Chb using the optimized capillary electrophoresis method and conventional HPLC product analysis. cPIP&#8211;Chb conjugate  3  showed higher alkylation activity at its binding sites than did hPIP&#8211;Chb conjugates  1  and  2  . Subsequent HPLC analysis revealed that the alkylation site of conjugate  3  , which was identified by capillary electrophoresis, was reliable and that conjugate  3  alkylates the N3 position of adenine as do hPIP&#8211;Chbs. Moreover, conjugate  3  showed higher cytotoxicity against LNCaP prostate cancer cells than did conjugate  1  and cytotoxicity comparable to that of conjugate  2  .

Under FA dehydrogenation conditions, 2 was progressively consumed, and the vast majority of the Ir centers (58%) was eventually found in the form of Cp*&#8208;complexes with a pyridine&#8208;amine ligand.

      <title>Enzyme multifunctionality via control of substrate positioning within the catalytic cycle &#8208; a QM/MM study for clavaminic acid synthase</title>
      <dc:description>Clavaminate synthase from Streptomyces clavuligerus is an Fe(II)/2&#8208;oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenase, crucial for the biosynthesis of the &#946;&#8208;lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. It catalyses three consecutive oxidative reactions, i.e. hydroxylation, cyclisation and desaturation in a single binding cavity. As follows from the results of this QM/MM study, CAS versatility and selectivity depends on the binding cavity, which interplays differently with substrate for each reaction. The enzyme&#8208;substrate interactions affect the substrate&#8217;s ability to re&#8208;position during the reaction, either constraining it in its primary position, which impedes processes other than oxygen rebound, or allowing change, which facilitates double bond formation. This differential effect originates from two aspartate residues, which strongly interact with the guanidine group of the hydroxylation substrate and stabilise orientation of the molecule.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Clavaminate synthase from Streptomyces clavuligerus is an Fe(II)/2&#8208;oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenase, crucial for the biosynthesis of the &#946;&#8208;lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. It catalyses three consecutive oxidative reactions, i.e. hydroxylation, cyclisation and desaturation in a single binding cavity. As follows from the results of this QM/MM study, CAS versatility and selectivity depends on the binding cavity, which interplays differently with substrate for each reaction. The enzyme&#8208;substrate interactions affect the substrate&#8217;s ability to re&#8208;position during the reaction, either constraining it in its primary position, which impedes processes other than oxygen rebound, or allowing change, which facilitates double bond formation. This differential effect originates from two aspartate residues, which strongly interact with the guanidine group of the hydroxylation substrate and stabilise orientation of the molecule.

      <title>Reversibly Switchable Phase&#8208;Dependent Emission of Quinoline and Phenothiazine Derivatives Towards Applications in Optical Sensing and Information Multi&#8208;Coding</title>
      <dc:description>Three new quinoline and di&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butyl phenothiazine isomeric derivatives were synthesized and characterized towards applications for oxygen sensing and optical information multi&#8208;coding. The compounds with phenylene linker showed outstanding phase&#8208;dependent reversibility between ON/OFF stages (low and high emission intensity, drastic shifting of emission colors, short&#8208; and long&#8208;lived fluorescence) under systematic grinding&#8208;fuming cycles required for multichannel memory devices based on optical information multi&#8208;coding. The conformational diversity of phenothiazine unit endowed dual emission of the doped films implemented by the different luminescent mechanisms with peaks located at 414/530 nm, 416/540 nm and 440/582 nm. The presence of phenylene linker and thus two rotational degrees of freedom resulted in quenching of delayed fluorescence of quasi&#8208;equatorial conformers in the solid state. The compound containing no phenylene bridge was characterized by two different driving photoluminescence mechanisms of the doped films: short fluorescence of quasi&#8208;axial conformer and TADF of quasi&#8208;equatorial form. This compound showed oxygen sensitivity with the Stern&#8211;Volmer constant of 7.5&#183;10  &#8208;4  pmm  &#8208;1  .</dc:description>

Since long&#8208;wavelength photoluminescence typically involves extensive p&#8208;conjugated systems of double bonds and aromatic rings, it is often assumed that NIR dyes have to be large molecules that require complex syntheses.

Cyclic voltammetry experiments on these compounds reveal multiple reversible redox waves linked to the interplay between the tertiary amine and BF  2  formazanate moieties.

      <title>Sulfonated 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Proton Conduction</title>
      <dc:description>Open 1D channels found in covalent organic frameworks are unique and promising to serve as pathways for proton conduction; how to develop high&#8208;rate yet stable transporting systems remains a substantial challenge. Herein, we report a strategy for exploring proton&#8208;conducting frameworks by engineering pore walls and installing proton&#8208;containing polymers into the pores. Amide&#8208;linked and sulfonated frameworks were synthesized from imine&#8208;linked precursors via sequentially engineering to oxidize into amide linkages and to further anchor sulfonic acid groups onto the pore walls, enabling the creation of sulfonated frameworks with high crystallinity and channel ordering. Integrating sulfonated polyether ether ketone chains into the open channels enables proton hopping to across the channels, greatly increases proton conductivity and enables a stable continuous run. These results suggest a way to explore proton&#8208;conducting COFs via systematic engineering of wall and space of the open nanochannels.</dc:description>

Amide&#8208;linked and sulfonated frameworks were synthesized from imine&#8208;linked precursors via sequentially engineering to oxidize into amide linkages and to further anchor sulfonic acid groups onto the pore walls, enabling the creation of sulfonated frameworks with high crystallinity and channel ordering. Integrating sulfonated polyether ether ketone chains into the open channels enables proton hopping to across the channels, greatly increases proton conductivity and enables a stable continuous run. These results suggest a way to explore proton&#8208;conducting COFs via systematic engineering of wall and space of the open nanochannels.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Cyanine Dyes Containing Quinoline Moieties: History, Synthesis, Optical Properties and Applications</title>
      <dc:description>Cyanine dyes carrying quinoline moieties are an important class of organic molecules having a great interest and applications in many fields like medicine, pharmacology, and engineering. Despite their exceptional properties, such as stability, high molar extinction coefficients, and high pH&#8208;sensitivity, this class of dyes has been less analyzed and reviewed for the last decades. Therefore, this review article is focusing on discussing the history of quinoline compounds, various synthetic routes to prepare quinolinium salts and symmetrical and asymmetrical mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, penta&#8208; and heptamethine cyanine dyes, containing quinoline moieties, together with their optical properties and applications as photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy, probes in biomolecules labeling of nucleic acids, as well as imaging agents.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The regioselectivity (r.s.) and enantiospecificity (e.s.) of the substitution reactions of secondary propargylic alcohol derivatives using reagents derived from ArMgBr and Cu salts were studied. First, the picolinate, 3&#8208;methylpicolinate, and diethylphosphonate derivatives of Ph(CH  2  )  2  CH(OH)C&#8801;CTMS were reacted with PhMgBr/CuCN in ratios of 2.5:2.7&#8211;2.5:0.25.

      <title>Isoindolinone Synthesis via One&#8208;Pot Type Transition Metal Catalyzed C&#8208;C Bond Forming Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>Isoindolinone structure is an important privileged scaffold found in a large variety of naturally occurring as well as synthetic, biologically and pharmaceutically active compounds. Owing to its crucial role in a number of applications, the synthetic methodologies for accessing this heterocyclic skeleton have received significant attention during the past decade. In general, the synthetic strategies can be divided into two categories: First, direct utilization of phthalimides or phthalimidines as starting materials for the synthesis of isoindolinones; and second, construction of the lactam and/or aromatic rings by different catalytic methods, including C&#8208;H activation, cross&#8208;coupling, carbonylation, condensation, addition and formal cycloaddition reactions. Especially in the last mentioned, utilization of transition metal catalysts provides access to a broad range of substituted isoindolinones.

      <title>Activation of Molecular Oxygen by a Cobalt(II) tetra&#8208;NHC Complex</title>
      <dc:description>The first dicobalt(III) &#181;2&#8208;peroxo N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complex is reported. It can be quantitatively generated from a cobalt(II) compound bearing a 16&#8208;membered macrocyclic tetra&#8208;NHC ligand via facile activation of dioxygen from air at ambient conditions. The reaction proceeds via an end&#8208;on superoxo intermediate as demonstrated by EPR studies and DFT. The peroxo moiety can be cleaved upon addition of acetic acid, yielding the corresponding Co(III) acetate complex going along with H2O2 formation. In contrast, both Co(II) and Co(III) complexes are also studied as catalysts to utilize air for olefin and alkane oxidation reactions, however not resulting in product formation. The observations are rationalized by DFT&#8209;calculations, suggesting a nucleophilic nature of the dicobalt(III) &#181;2&#8208;peroxo complex. All isolated compounds are characterized by NMR, ESI&#8208;MS, elemental analysis, EPR and SC&#8208;XRD.</dc:description>

      <title>A Light&#8208;Harvesting/Charge&#8208;Separation Model with Energy Gradient Made of Assemblies of meta&#8208;pyridyl&#160;Zinc Porphyrins</title>
      <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly of porphyrins is a fascinating topic not only for mimicking chlorophyll assemblies in photosynthetic organisms but also for the potential of creating molecular&#8208;level devices. Herein we have prepared zinc porphyrin derivatives bearing a&#160;meta&#8208;pyridyl group at the&#160;meso&#8208;position and studied their assemblies in chloroform. Among porphyrins studied, one with a carbamoylpyridyl moiety (ZnPPyC) gave distinct&#160;1H NMR spectrum in CDCl3, which allowed us to probe the supramolecular structure in solution in detail. Ring&#8208;current induced chemical shift changes in&#160;1H NMR, together with vapor pressure osmometry and diffusion&#8208;ordered NMR spectroscopy, among other evidence, suggested that the porphyrin molecules form a trimer in a triangular cone structure. Further incorporation of a directly&#8208;linked porphyrin&#8208;ferrocene dyads with the same assembling properties in the assemblies lead to a rare light&#8208;harvesting/charge&#8208;separation model, in which an energy gradient is incorporated and reductive quenching occurs.</dc:description>

Among porphyrins studied, one with a carbamoylpyridyl moiety (ZnPPyC) gave distinct&#160;1H NMR spectrum in CDCl3, which allowed us to probe the supramolecular structure in solution in detail. Ring&#8208;current induced chemical shift changes in&#160;1H NMR, together with vapor pressure osmometry and diffusion&#8208;ordered NMR spectroscopy, among other evidence, suggested that the porphyrin molecules form a trimer in a triangular cone structure. Further incorporation of a directly&#8208;linked porphyrin&#8208;ferrocene dyads with the same assembling properties in the assemblies lead to a rare light&#8208;harvesting/charge&#8208;separation model, in which an energy gradient is incorporated and reductive quenching occurs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Applications of Low Melting&#8208;Point Metals in Rechargeable Metal Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Low melting&#8208;point (LMP) metals represent an interesting family of electrode materials due to their high ionic conductivity, good ductility or fluidity, low hardness and/or superior alloying capability, all of which are crucial characteristics to address battery challenges such as interfacial incompatibility, electrode pulverization and dendrite growth. This minireview summarizes recent research progress of typical LMP metals including In, Ga, Hg and their alloys in rechargeable metal batteries. And emphasis is placed on mainstream electrochemical storage devices of Li, Na and K batteries as well as the representative multi&#8208;valent metal batteries. We attempt to highlight the fundamental correlations between unique physiochemical properties of LMP metals and the battery performance. In addition, this article also provides insights into future development and potential directions of LMP metals/alloys for practical applications.</dc:description>

The multiplicity and J&#8208;coupling constants of  1  H,  11  B  19  F/  11  B NMR signals revealed, in the  nPEC4&#8208;By  series, that the phenyl in meso position of the BODIPY becomes electronically part of the conjugation of the phenyleneethynylene chain, while By is electronically isolated.

      <title>New bio&#8208;based furanic materials effectively absorb metals from water and exert antimicrobial activity</title>
      <dc:description>Development of sustainable bio&#8208;based materials for removal of toxic contaminants from water is a high priority goal. Novel bio&#8208;based binary and ternary copolymers with enhanced ion&#8208;exchange, adsorption and antibacterial properties were obtained using plant biomass&#8208;derived diallyl esters of furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) as crosslinking agents and easily available vinyl monomers. The synthesized copolymer materials showed higher sorption capacities for Ni(II), Co(II) and Cu(II) compared to the commercial ion&#8208;exchange resins and maintained their high metal adsorption capacities for over 10 cycles of regeneration. The synthesized copolymer gels containing 1&#8211;5 wt% of the crosslinker showed excellent water absorption capacities. The synthesized copolymers with 1% crosslinker content showed swelling ratios high enough to also act as moisture absorbents. The synthesized copolymers with crosslinker content of 10 wt% performed as contact&#8208;active antibacterials by inhibiting the growth of Gram&#8208;positive (S. aureus) and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria (E. coli, K. pneumonia) in suspension tests.</dc:description>

      <title>Photoactive nickel complexes in cross coupling catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Transition metal catalyzed cross coupling reactions are important in chemical synthesis for the formation of C&#8208;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bonds. Suitable catalysts are frequently based on palladium or nickel, and lately the cheaper and more abundant first&#8208;row transition metal element has been much in focus. The combination of nickel catalysis with photoredox chemistry has opened new synthetic possibilities, and in some cases electronically excited states of nickel complexes play a key role. This is a remarkable finding, because photo&#8208;excited metal complexes are underexplored in the context of organic bond&#8208;forming reactions, and because the photophysics and the photochemistry of first&#8208;row transition metal complexes are underdeveloped in comparison to their precious metal&#8208;based congeners. Consequently, there is much potential for innovation at the interface of synthetic&#8208;organic and physical&#8208;inorganic chemistry. This minireview highlights recent key findings in light&#8208;driven nickel catalysis and identifies essential concepts for the exploitation of photoactive nickel complexes in organic synthesis.</dc:description>

      <title>Direct Catalytic Asymmetric Addition of &#945;&#8208;Fluoronitriles to Aldehydes</title>
      <dc:description>A fluorine&#8208;containing tetrasubstituted stereogenic center is a highly valued structural feature in medicinal chemistry. Herein, we describe the direct coupling of achiral &#945;&#8208;fluoronitriles and aldehydes promoted by a chiral Cu(I)/Barton&#8217;s base catalytic system, delivering &#945;&#8208;tetrasubstituted &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxynitriles with satisfactory stereoselection. The stereochemical course was positively biased by the combined use of asymmetrical achiral thiourea as a supplementary ligand for Cu(I), which significantly enhanced the stereoselectivity. Both aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes were implemented to provide densely and stereoselectively functionalized chiral building blocks with aliphatic and aromatic tails.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthetic processes towards nitriles without cyanide: A biocatalytic concept based on dehydration of aldoximes in water</title>
      <dc:description>While belonging to the most fundamental functional groups, nitriles represent a class of compound still raising challenges in terms of an efficient, cost&#8208;effective and at the same time sustainable way for their synthesis. Complementing existing chemical routes recently a cyanide&#8208;free enzymatic process technology based on the use of an aldoxime dehydratase (Oxd) as biocatalyst component has been developed and successfully applied for a range of nitrile products. In these biotransformations, these Oxd enzymes catalyze the dehydration of aldoximes as readily available substrates to the desired nitrile products. Within this concept article these developments with such enzymes are summarized with a strong focus on the synthetic application side. By means of the achieved synthetic examples, it will be demonstrated that this biocatalytic technology has the potential to &#8220;cross the bridge&#8221; between the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals on the one hand and bulk and commodity chemicals on the other hand. For example, Oxd enzymes were found to give high enantioselectivities and can give access to both enantiomers when starting either from the (  E  )&#8208; or (  Z  )&#8208;aldoxime racemate. However, besides their high potential towards stereoselective synthesis making the attractive for the area of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals, Oxd enzymes also turned out to suitable for the dehydration of a range of aldoximes derived from aliphatic achiral commodity chemicals, leading to the corresponding nitriles, e.g., adiponitrile and fatty nitriles, with high substrate loading up to the Kg per L range as a required criteria for the field of bulk chemicals production.</dc:description>

      <title>Plausible emergence of biochemistry in Enceladus based on chemobrionics</title>
      <dc:description>Saturn&#8217;s satellite Enceladus is proposed to have a soda type subsurface ocean with temperature able to support life and an iron ore&#8208;based core. Here, we demonstrate that ocean chemistry related to Enceladus can support the development of Fe&#8208;based hydrothermal vents, one of the places suggested to be the cradle of life. The Fe&#8208;based chemical gardens were characterized with FT&#8208;IR spectroscopy and XRD. The developed chemobrionic structures catalyzed the condensation polymerization of simple organic prebiotic molecules to kerogens. Further, they could passively catalyze the condensation of the prebiotic molecule formamide to larger polymers suggesting that elementary biochemical precursors could have emerged in Enceladus.</dc:description>

      <title>Tuning of Bistability, Thermal Stability of the Metastable States and Application Prospects in the C3 Symmetric Designs of Multiple Azo(hetero)arenes Systems</title>
      <dc:description>Light&#8208;responsive molecular systems with multiple photoswitches in  C  3  symmetric designs have enormous application potential. The design part of such molecular systems is critical due to its influence in several properties associated with the photoswitches. In order to tune, and in the evaluation of the design&#8208;property relationship, we synthesized 18 tripodal systems with variations in the core, linkers, connectivity, and azo(hetero)arene photoswitches. Through extensive spectroscopic and computational studies, we envisaged the factors controlling near&#8208;quantitative photoisomerization in both the directions (bistability) and the thermal stability of the metastable states. Furthermore, we also evaluated the impact of designs in obtaining reversible photo&#8208;responsive sol&#8208;gel phase transitions, solvatochromism, photo&#8208; and thermochromism.</dc:description>
