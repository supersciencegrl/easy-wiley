         <title>Activation of the Ga(I) cation for bond activation: from oxidative additions into C&#8722;Cl and H&#8722;P bonds to reversible insertion into P4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although the discovery of the Ga(I) complex salt [Ga(PhF)2&#8208;3][Al(ORF)4] (RF = C(CF3)) invoked the preparation of a diverse library of cationic Ga(I) coordination complexes and clusters, studies on small molecule activation with low&#8208;valent Ga(I) cations are scarce. Here, a first experimental study on the reactivity of a monomeric Ga(I) cation activated with a pyridine&#8208;diimine pincer&#8208;ligand (in [Ga(PDIdipp)][Al(ORF)4]) towards small&#8208;molecules is reported. First controlled oxidative additions of the Ga(I) cation into C&#8722;Cl, H&#8722;P and P&#8722;P bonds are presented. Moreover, the [4+1] cycloaddition to butadienes was achieved. Intriguingly, the isolated, blue insertion product into the P&#8722;P bond of P4 allows for quantitative release of the P4 molecule upon reaction with AlEt3 and butadienes. Reversible P4 insertion of main&#8208;group metals has previously on been reported for Ge and Sn respectively. The experimental study is supported by high level computational analysis of the in part reversible oxidative additions at the DLPNO&#8208;CCSD(T)/def2&#8208;TZVPP//PBEh&#8208;3c/def2&#8208;mSVP level of theory with COSMO&#8208;RS solvation in 1,2&#8208;difluorobenzene.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable Chromic Properties of Viologen&#8208;Metal Polymers Modulated by Coordination Modes for Inkless Erasable Printing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inkless and erasable printing (IEP) based on chromic materials holds great promise to alleviate environmental and sustainable problems. Metal&#8208;organic polymers (MOPs) are bright platforms for constructing IEP materials. However, it is still challenging to design target MOPs with excellent specific functions rationally due to the intricate component&#8208;structure&#8208;property relationships. Herein, an effective strategy was proposed for the rational design IEP&#8208;MOP materials. The stimuli&#8208;responsive viologen moiety was introduced into the construction of MOPs to give it potential chromic behaviors and two different coordination models (i.e. bilateral coordination model, M1; unilateral coordinated model, M2) based on the same viologen ligand were designed. Aided by theoretical calculations, model M1 was recommended secondarily as a more suitable system for IEP materials. Along this line, two representative viologen&#8208;ZnII MOPs 1 and 2 with models M1 and M2 were synthesized successfully. Experiments exhibit that 1 does have quicker stimuli response, stronger color contrast and longer radical lifetime compared to 2. Significantly, the obtained 1&#8208;IEP media brightly inherits the excellent chromic characteristics of 1 and the flexibility of the paper at the same time, which achieves most daily printing requirements, as well as enough resolution and durability to be used in identification by smart device.</dc:description>

         <title>Theoretical Prediction of Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2 Using a 2D Catalyst Composed of 3d Transition Metal and Hexaamine Dipyrazino Quinoxaline</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metals and organic ligands combine to form metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), which possess distinct active sites, large specific surface areas and stable porous structures, giving them considerable promise for CO2 reduction electrocatalysis. In the present study, using spin polarisation density&#8208;functional theory, a series of 2D MOFs constructed from 3d transition metal and hexamethylene dipyrazoline quinoxaline were investigated. The calculated binding energies between HADQ and metal atoms for the ten TM&#8208;HADQ monolayers were strong sufficient to stably disperse the metal atoms in the HADQ monolayers. Of the ten catalysts tested, seven (Sc, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ti, V and Cr) exhibited high CO2 reduction selectivity, while Mn, Fe and Co required pH values above 2.350, 6.461 and 6.363, respectively, to exhibit CO2 reduction selectivity. HCOOH was the most important producer for Sc, Zn, Ni and Mn, while CH4 was the main producer for Ti, Cr, Fe and V. The Cu&#8208;HADQ catalyst had a high overpotential for the HCHO product (1.022 V), while the other catalysts had lower overpotentials between 0.016V and 0.792V. Thus, these results predict TM&#8208;HADQ to show excellent activity in CO2 electrocatalytic reduction and to become a promising electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;catalyzed&#160;&#945;&#8208;arylation of enol acetate using recyclable silica&#8208;supported heteroleptic and homoleptic copper(I) photosensitizers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Earth&#8208;abundant photosensitizers are highly sought after for light&#8208;mediated applications, such as photoredox catalysis, depollution and energy conversion schemes. Homoleptic and heteroleptic copper(I) complexes are promising candidates in this field, as copper is abundant and the corresponding complexes are easily obtained in smooth conditions. However, some heteroleptic copper(I) complexes suffer from low (photo)stability that leads to the gradual formation of the corresponding homoleptic complex. Such degradation pathways are detrimental, especially when recyclability is desired. In here, we report a novel approach for the heterogenization of homoleptic and heteroleptic Cu complexes on silica nanoparticles. In both cases, the photophysical properties upon surface immobilization were only slightly affected. Excited&#8208;state quenching with aryl diazonium derivatives occurred efficiently (108&#8208;1010&#160;M&#8211;1&#160;s&#8211;1) with heterogeneous and homogeneous photosensitizers. Moderate but almost identical yields were obtained for the&#160;a&#8208;arylation of enol acetate using the homoleptic complex in homogeneous or heterogeneous conditions. Importantly, the silica&#8208;supported photocatalysts were recycled with moderate loss in photoactivity over multiple experiments. Transient absorption spectroscopy confirmed that excited&#8208;state electron transfer occurred from the homogeneous and heterogeneous homoleptic copper(I) complexes to aryl diazonium derivatives, generating the corresponding copper(II) center that persisted for several hundreds of microseconds, compatible with photoredox catalysis applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic Analysis of the Photochemical Paths in Asymmetric Diarylethene Dimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 46, August 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric diarylethene dimer composed of two different diarylethenes exhibited multicolor photochromism and generated four isomers. Photochemical paths such as quantum yields, lifetimes, and rate constants were evaluated from the points of the dimer&#8208; and unit&#8208;based models. The m&#8208;phenylene spacer regulates the rate of energy transfer to be similar value of photoisomerization.







Abstract
An asymmetric diarylethene dimer composed of 2&#8208; and 3&#8208;thienylethene units linked by m&#8208;phenylene developed various colors upon UV irradiation via an independent photochromic reaction on each unit. The change in contents and the other photoresponses of the photogenerated four isomers were analyzed using quantum yield for all the possible photochemical paths, i.&#8201;e., photoisomerization, fluorescence, energy transfer, and the other non&#8208;radiative paths. Almost all the rate constants of photochemical paths were calculated using measurable quantum yields and lifetimes. It was found that a significant contribution on photoresponse was the competition between photoisomerization and intramolecular energy transfer. The clear difference was observed in the photoresponses of the dimer and the 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture solution of the model compounds. The m&#8208;phenylene spacer appropriately regulated the rate of energy transfer in the asymmetric dimer, and the spacer enabled isolation of the excited state of the dimer, making the above quantitative analysis possible.

&lt;p&gt;An asymmetric diarylethene dimer composed of 2- and 3-thienylethene units linked by &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-phenylene developed various colors upon UV irradiation via an independent photochromic reaction on each unit. The change in contents and the other photoresponses of the photogenerated four isomers were analyzed using quantum yield for all the possible photochemical paths, i.&#8201;e., photoisomerization, fluorescence, energy transfer, and the other non-radiative paths. Almost all the rate constants of photochemical paths were calculated using measurable quantum yields and lifetimes. It was found that a significant contribution on photoresponse was the competition between photoisomerization and intramolecular energy transfer. The clear difference was observed in the photoresponses of the dimer and the 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture solution of the model compounds.

Consistent: The unified redox scale EH20/abs is valid for all solvents. Still, the existence of their widely used constituents, the single ion properties &#8211; redox potential or pH value &#8211; are disputed. Yet, the sum of the single ion Gibbs transfer energy of electroactive cation and anion must equal the Gibbs transfer energy of the constituting salt, which is measurable without any assumption. With the recently proposed &#8216;ideal&#8217; ILSB&#8208;method to determine Gibbs transfer energies of single ions, we now show that this condition is fulfilled. Hence, our simple electrochemical method yields consistent single&#8208;ion magnitudes proving the validity of the assembled unified redox scale.







Abstract
We have devised the unified redox scale EabsH2O, which is valid for all solvents. The necessary single ion Gibbs transfer energy between two different solvents, which only can be determined with extra&#8208;thermodynamic assumptions so far, must clearly satisfy two essential conditions: First, the sum of the independent cation and anion values must give the Gibbs transfer energy of the salt they form. The latter is an observable and measurable without extra&#8208;thermodynamic assumptions. Second, the values must be consistent for different solvent combinations. With this work, potentiometric measurements on silver ions and on chloride ions show that both conditions are fulfilled using a salt bridge filled with the ionic liquid [N2225][NTf2]: if compared to the values resulting from known pKL values, the silver and chloride single ion magnitudes combine within a uncertainty of 1.5&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 to the directly measurable transfer magnitudes of the salt AgCl from water to the solvents acetonitrile, propylene carbonate, dimethylformamide, ethanol, and methanol. The resulting values are used to further develop the consistent unified redox potential scale EabsH2O that now allows to assess and compare redox potentials in and over six different solvents. We elaborate on its implications.

         <title>Free Ethynylarsinidene and Ethynylstibinidene: Heavier Analogues of Nitrenes and Phosphinidenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 46, August 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triplet ethynylarsinidene (HCCAs) and ethynylstibinidene (HCCSb) were generated photochemically in argon matrices from their corresponding pnictines. Electronic structures of these species are compared with HCCN and HCCP in light of their vibrational and electronic spectra and with support from theory.







Abstract
Until now, there has been very little experimental evidence for the existence of free arsinidenes and stibinidenes, apart from the hydrides, AsH and SbH. Here, we report on photogeneration of triplet ethynylarsinidene, HCCAs, and triplet ethynylstibinidene, HCCSb, from ethynylarsine and ethynylstibine, respectively, in solid argon matrices. The products were identified using infrared spectroscopy and the associated UV absorption spectra are interpreted with the aid of theoretical predictions.

         <title>Structural Conversion of Supramolecular Assembly in Solution by Thermally Induced Intramolecular Electron Transfer of [Co2Fe2] Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 46, August 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural conversion of a supramolecular assembly was controlled by the thermally induced electron transfer&#8208;coupled spin transition (ETCST) of a [Co2Fe2] complex. The complex with an amphiphilic anion formed reverse vesicles in solution. The thermal ETCST of the complex in the presence of a dicarboxylic acid changed the structure from the reverse vesicle to entangled one&#8208;dimensional chains through the formation of hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
Combining metal complexes with amphiphilic molecules leads to a wide variety of functional self&#8208;assembled nanostructures. Metal complexes exhibiting spin transitions can be good candidates as the trigger to cause structural conversion of such assembly because they respond to various external stimuli. In this work, we studied a structural conversion of a supramolecular assembly containing a [Co2Fe2] complex through a thermally induced electron transfer&#8208;coupled spin transition (ETCST). With an amphiphilic anion, the [Co2Fe2] complex formed reverse vesicles in solution and showed thermal ETCST. In contrast, thermal ETCST in the presence of a bridging hydrogen&#8208;bond donor caused structural conversion from the reverse vesicle structure to entangled one&#8208;dimensional chains through hydrogen bond formation.

A series of V&#8208;shaped tetraphenylbutadiene&#8208;based aggregation&#8208;induced emission&#8208;active chiral polyamides bearing n&#8208;propyl/hexyl/dodecyl side&#8208;chains are reported.

And P1&#8208;C6 is a fluorescence probe for Fe3+.







Abstract
Chiral aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) molecules have drawn attention for their helical self&#8208;assembly and special optical properties. The helical self&#8208;assembly of AIE&#8208;active chiral non&#8208;linear main&#8208;chain polymers can produce some desired optical features. In this work, a series of V&#8208;shaped chiral AIE&#8208;active polyamides P1&#8208;C3, P1&#8208;C6, P1&#8208;C12 and linear P2&#8208;C3, P2&#8208;C6, bearing n&#8208;propyl/hexyl/dodecyl side&#8208;chains, based on tetraphenylbutadiene (TPB), were prepared. All target main&#8208;chain polymers exhibit distinct AIE characteristics. The polymer P1&#8208;C6 with moderate length alkyl chains shows better AIE properties. The V&#8208;shaped main&#8208;chains and the chiral induction of (1R,2R)&#8208;(+)&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine in each repeating unit promote the polymer chains display helical conformation, and multiple helical polymer chains induce nano&#8208;fibers helicity when the polymer chains aggregate and self&#8208;assemble in THF/H2O mixtures. Simultaneously, the helical conformation polymer chains and helical nano&#8208;fibers cause P1&#8208;C6 produce strong circular dichroism (CD) signals with positive Cotton effect. Moreover, P1&#8208;C6 could also occur fluorescence quenching response to Fe3+ selectively with a low detection limit of 3.48&#8197;&#956;mol/L.

         <title>Highly Soluble Cyclic Organoalanes Based on Anionic Dicarbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 46, August 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carbocyclic aluminium hydrides [(ADCAr)AlH2]2 are readily accessible as crystalline solids on treatment of anionic dicarbenes Li(ADCAr) with LiAlH4. Hydroalumination of CO2 (and other organic substrates) with [(ADCPh)AlH2]2 has been shown to access [(ADCPh)Al(OCH(O))2]2 (and other products).







Abstract
Cyclic organoalane compounds [(ADCAr)AlH2]2 (ADCAr = ArC{(DippN)C}2; Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; Ar = Ph or 4&#8208;PhC6H4 (Bp)) based on anionic dicarbene (ADC) frameworks have been reported as crystalline solids. Treatments of Li(ADCAr) with LiAlH4 at room temperature afford [(ADCAr)AlH2]2 with the concomitant release of LiH. Compounds [(ADCAr)AlH2]2 are stable crystalline solids and are freely soluble in common organic solvents. They are annulated tricyclic compounds with an almost planar central C4Al2&#8208;core embedded between two peripheral 1,3&#8208;imidazole (C3N2) rings. At room temperature, [(ADCPh)AlH2]2 readily reacts with CO2 to form two&#8208; and four&#8208;fold hydroalumination products [(ADCPh)AlH(OCHO)]2 and [(ADCPh)Al(OCHO)2]2, respectively. Further hydroalumination reactivity of [(ADCPh)AlH2]2 has been shown with isocyanate (RNCO) and isothiocyanate (RNCS) species (R=alkyl or aryl group). All compounds have been characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Electrochemical Preparation of Sm(II) Reagent Facilitated by Weakly Coordinating Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 46, August 15, 2023. </description>

Electrochemical analysis of the potential and reversibility of the Sm(11)/Sm(111) redox couple will inform the development of electrocatalytic Sm&#8208;driven reactions in organic synthesis.







Abstract
Samarium diiodide (SmI2) is widely used as a strong one&#8208;electron reducing agent and is often employed to form C&#8722;C bonds in complex systems. Despite their utility, SmI2 and related salts suffer from several drawbacks that render the use of Sm reducing agents in large&#8208;scale synthesis impractical. Here, we report factors influencing the electrochemical reduction of Sm(III) to Sm(II), towards the goal of electrocatalytic Sm(III) reduction. We probe the effect of supporting electrolyte, electrode material, and Sm precursor on Sm(II)/(III) redox and on the reducing power of the Sm species. We find that the coordination strength of the counteranion of the Sm salt affects the reversibility and redox potential of the Sm(II)/(III) couple and establish that the counteranion primarily determines the reducibility of Sm(III). Electrochemically generated SmI2 performs similarly to commercial SmI2 solutions in a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept reaction. The results will provide fundamental insight to facilitate the development of Sm&#8208;electrocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Direct Alkylative Amination Using 1&#8208;Allylsilatrane

DRA is so pass&#233;. Three&#8208;component reactions involving the condensation of unprotected aniline and benzaldehyde substrates being intercepted by 1&#8208;allylsilatrane in a direct alkylative amination afford a variety of homoallylic amines under robust, air&#8208; and water&#8208;tolerant conditions. A single precursor is then used to highlight the versatility of the scaffold by generating azetidine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, and quinoline analogues.







Abstract
Homoallylic amines prepared via addition of allylsilanes often require preformed imine substrates, metal catalysts, fluoride activators, or use of protected amines. In this metal&#8208;free, air&#8208; and water&#8208;tolerant procedure, aromatic aldehyde and aniline substrates undergo direct alkylative amination using easily accessible 1&#8208;allylsilatrane.

Fluorescent probes: In two triangulenium fluorophores we have tested the efficiency of photoinduced electron transfer (PET) quenching by appended aryl amine moieties. Depending on the dihedral angle within the conjugated quencher moiety we observed a 20&#8208;fold change in the PET&#8208;quenching rate.Investigating Design Rules for Photoinduced Electron Transfer Quenching in Triangulenium Probes (Laursen et&#8197;al.) @ChemKUniversity @jesperdj10 @BoWLaursen







Abstract
Fluorescent probes based on photoinduced electron transfer (PET) quenching of long lifetime triangulenium fluorophores have found multiple applications. For such probes a successful design relies on the right balance between the rate of PET quenching and fluorescence. In a series of ADOTA (A) and DAOTA (D) triangulenium fluorophores appended with aniline&#8208;like quencher moieties, we have investigated the rate of quenching and its relation to thermodynamic driving force, distance, and conjugation within the quencher moiety. Three different quenchers, a short (1), a long (2), and a long twisted (3), 4&#8208;aminophenyl, 4&#8217;&#8208;aminobiphenyl, and 2,2&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8217;&#8208;aminobiphenyl, respectively were investigated. Steady&#8208;state spectroscopy and electrochemistry confirms that the quencher moieties are electronically decoupled from the dyes and have similar oxidation potentials and thus driving force for PET quenching, irrespectively of their different length and conjugation. Time&#8208;resolved fluorescence measurement was used to measure the fast PET quenching, with rate constant kPET ranging from &gt;4&#215;1011 to 2&#215;109&#8197;s&#8722;1. Interestingly, PET quenching is equally efficient/fast from 1 and 2, even with increase in distance between the donor and the acceptor. However, when twisting the biphenyl in 3, a 20&#8208;fold decrease in quenching is found. Even with this decrease in kPET, the quenching in 3&#8201;A/D is still highly efficient, with nearly 99&#8201;% quenching. The study show that long lifetime fluorophores can be efficiently switched even by relatively slow PET processes and that PET quencher moieties can be removed far from the fluorophore if conjugated linkers are applied.

         <title>Corrosion Engineering towards NiFe&#8208;Layered Double Hydroxide Macroporous Arrays with Enhanced Activity and Stability for Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 46, August 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiFe&#8208;LDH macroporous arrays are prepared by a controllable corrosion strategy. The unique macroporous array not only increases the active area, but also creates a stable nanostructure. The catalysts only need 180&#8197;mV and 248&#8197;mV to reach 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for OER, respectively, and remain highly stable for 1000&#8197;h at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
NiFe&#8208;layered double hydroxide (NiFe&#8208;LDH) is the benchmark catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline medium, however, it is still challenging to improve its activity and stability. Herein, NiFe&#8208;LDH macroporous array electrodes are demonstrated to significantly enhance the activity and stability for oxygen evolution reaction. The electrodes are fabricated by the chemical and electrochemical corrosion process of Ni foam induced by ferric nitrate, hydrochloric acid and oxygen. By optimizing the amount of iron salt and acid and selecting the appropriate reaction temperature and time, the NiFe&#8208;LDH electrodes only need the overpotential of 180&#8197;mV and 248&#8197;mV to reach the current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively, and remain highly stable for 1000&#8197;h at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NiFe-LDH macroporous arrays&lt;/b&gt; are prepared by a controllable corrosion strategy. The unique macroporous array not only increases the active area, but also creates a stable nanostructure. The catalysts only need 180&#8197;mV and 248&#8197;mV to reach 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for OER, respectively, and remain highly stable for 1000&#8197;h at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NiFe-layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) is the benchmark catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline medium, however, it is still challenging to improve its activity and stability. Herein, NiFe-LDH macroporous array electrodes are demonstrated to significantly enhance the activity and stability for oxygen evolution reaction. The electrodes are fabricated by the chemical and electrochemical corrosion process of Ni foam induced by ferric nitrate, hydrochloric acid and oxygen. By optimizing the amount of iron salt and acid and selecting the appropriate reaction temperature and time, the NiFe-LDH electrodes only need the overpotential of 180&#8197;mV and 248&#8197;mV to reach the current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, and remain highly stable for 1000&#8197;h at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The unique macroporous array not only significantly increases the active area of NiFe-LDH catalyst, but also creates a stable nanostructure that avoids severe reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
A method to oxidize toluene selectively to benzaldehyde photochemically is described. A series of copper(I) complexes with different ligands were applied in combination with [Ru(bipy)3](PF6)2 and dioxygen as the oxidant. The copper(II) complexes obtained after oxidation were photochemically reduced to the starting copper(I) species, and the process can be repeated continuously.







Abstract
A method is described to photochemically oxidize toluene selectively to benzaldehyde, an essential compound in the chemical industry. Copper(I) complexes with different ligands were applied in combination with [Ru(bipy)3](PF6)2 and dioxygen as the oxidant. As a result, a &#8220;dioxygen adduct&#8221; copper complex, for example, a peroxido complex, is formed as the active species. The copper(II) complex obtained after oxidation can be photochemically reduced to the starting copper(I) species, and the process can be repeated continuously. The ligand tris(2&#8208;methylpyridyl)amine (tmpa) led to the highest conversion rates.

         <title>Spin Crossover and Fluorine&#8208;Specific Interactions in Metal Complexes of Terpyridines with Polyfluorocarbon Tails</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 46, August 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron(II) and cobalt(II) complexes with terpyridine ligands containing PFC tails are reported. All complexes are redox rich. The cobalt(II) complexes display spin crossover, and the magnetic properties in those cases are dependent on the length of the PFC tail. Fluorine&#8208;specific interactions are observed between the PFC tails, and this effect translates into exchange narrowing of the corresponding EPR spectra of the cobalt complexes.







Abstract
In coordination chemistry and materials science, terpyridine ligands are of great interest, due to their ability to form stable complexes with a broad range of transition metal ions. We report three terpyridine ligands containing different perfluorocarbon (PFC) tails on the backbone and the corresponding FeII and CoII complexes. The CoII complexes display spin crossover close to ambient temperature, and the nature of this spin transition is influenced by the length of the PFC tail on the ligand backbone. The electrochemical properties of the metal complexes were investigated with cyclic voltammetry revealing one oxidation and several reduction processes. The fluorine&#8208;specific interactions were investigated by EPR measurements. Analysis of the EPR spectra of the complexes as microcrystalline powders and in solution reveals exchange&#8208;narrowed spectra without resolved hyperfine splittings arising from the 59Co nucleus; this suggests complex aggregation in solution mediated by interactions of the PFC tails. Interestingly, addition of perfluoro&#8208;octanol in different ratios to the acetonitrile solution of the sample resulted in the disruption of the F
F interactions of the tails. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first investigation of fluorine&#8208;specific interactions in metal complexes through EPR spectroscopy, as exemplified by exchange narrowing.

         <title>Light&#8208;Cleavable Auxiliary for Diselenide&#8211;Selenoester Ligations of Peptides and Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 46, August 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Straightforward access to seleno&#8208;based light&#8208;cleavable auxiliaries, including diverse amino acids, facilitates access to challenging protein targets via diselenide&#8211;selenoester ligations (DSL) and expressed protein selenoester ligations (EPSL).







Abstract
Diselenide&#8211;selenoester ligations are increasingly used for the synthesis of proteins. Excellent ligation rates, even at low concentrations, in combination with mild and selective deselenization conditions can overcome some of the most severe challenges in chemical protein synthesis. Herein, the versatile multicomponent synthesis and application of a new ligation auxiliary that combines a photocleavable scaffold with the advantages of selenium&#8208;based ligation strategies are presented. Its use was investigated with respect to different ligation junctions and describe a novel para&#8208;methoxybenzyl deprotection reaction for the selenol moiety. The glycine&#8208;based auxiliary enabled successful synthesis of the challenging target protein G&#8208;CSF.

         <title>Ultrasmall Gold Nanoparticles as Clients of Biomolecular Condensates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 46, August 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasmall gold nanoparticles concentrate and distribute into biomolecular condensates. The nanoparticles establish dynamic noncovalent interactions with the scaffold protein and act as clients. They may also favor or disfavor condensate formation. The nanoparticles could be used to explore biomolecular condensates in&#8197;vitro and in cellular models of pathology.







Abstract
Liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) of biopolymers to form condensates is a widespread phenomenon in living cells. Agents that target or alter condensation can help uncover elusive physiological and pathological mechanisms. Owing to their unique material properties and modes of interaction with biomolecules, nanoparticles represent attractive condensate&#8208;targeting agents.
Our work focused on elucidating the interaction between ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (usGNPs) and diverse types of condensates of tau, a representative phase&#8208;separating protein associated with neurodegenerative disorders. usGNPs attract considerable interest in the biomedical community due to unique features, including emergent optical properties and good cell penetration. We explored the interaction of usGNPs with reconstituted self&#8208;condensates of tau, two&#8208;component tau/polyanion and three&#8208;component tau/RNA/alpha&#8208;synuclein coacervates. The usGNPs were found to concentrate into condensed liquid droplets, consistent with the formation of dynamic client (nanoparticle) &#8208; scaffold (tau) interactions, and were observable thanks to their intrinsic luminescence. Furthermore, usGNPs were capable to promote LLPS of a protein domain which is unable to phase separate on its own.
Our study demonstrates the ability of usGNPs to interact with and illuminate protein condensates. We anticipate that nanoparticles will have broad applicability as nanotracers to interrogate phase separation, and as nanoactuators controlling the formation and dissolution of condensates.

         <title>Non&#8208;Conjugated Bis&#8208;(Dithienylethene)&#8208;Naphthalenediimide as a Dynamic Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Agent: Driving the Wheel of Photoswitching Enactment</title>

A non&#8208;conjugated bis&#8208;(dithienylethene)&#8208;naphthalenediimide based photo&#8208;responsive molecule is reported, having photoinduced electron transfer regulated enhancement of fluorescence property upon photocyclization, which can be utilized in secret code encryption&#8208;decryption and erasable ink applications.







Abstract
Photochromic fluorescent molecules dramatically extend their fields of applications ranging from optical memories, bioimaging, photoswitches, photonic devices, anti&#8208;counterfeiting technology and many more. Here, we have logically designed and synthesized a triazole appended bis&#8208;(dithienylethene)&#8208;naphthalenediimide based photo&#8208;responsive material, 5, which demonstrated fluorescence enhancement property upon photocyclization (&#934;F=0.42), with high photocyclization (44&#8197;s, ksolution=0.0355&#8197;s&#8722;1, ksolid=0.0135&#8197;s&#8722;1) and photocycloreversion (160&#8197;s, ksolution=0.0181&#8197;s&#8722;1, ksolid=0.0085&#8197;s&#8722;1) rate and decent photoreaction quantum yield (&#934;o&#8594;c=0.93 and &#934;c&#8594;o=0.11). The open isomer almost converted to the closed isomer at photo&#8208;stationary state (PSS) with distinct color change from colorless to blue with 92.85&#8201;% conversion yield. A reversible noninvasive modulation of fluorescence through efficient photoinduced electron transfer (PET) process was observed both in solution as well as in solid state. The fluorescence modulation through PET process was further corroborated with thermodynamic calculations using the Rehm&#8211;Weller equation and quantum chemical studies (DFT). The thermally stable compound 5 exhibits high fatigue resistance property (up to 50&#8197;cycles) both in solution and solid state. Furthermore, the compound 5 was successfully applied as erasable ink and in deciphering secret codes (Quick Response/bar code) portending potential promising application in anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Dissymmetric Triaryltriazines: Small Mass Columnar Glasses</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 46, August 15, 2023. </description>

Cotrimerization of complementary benzonitriles leads to dissymmetric triaryltriazines that form anisotropic mesomorphic luminescent glasses at very small molecular weight.







Abstract
Columnar liquid crystals with very small molecular masses that form anisotropic glasses well above room temperature are obtained by mixed dissymmetric substitution of sym&#8208;triazine with ester&#8208;bearing phenyl and phenanthryl or tetrahelicenyl moieties. The combination of low molecular symmetry with configurational flexibility and short polar ester moieties stabilizes the mesophase over large temperature ranges and induces pronounced calorimetric glass transitions within the anisotropic fluid despite the smallness of the molecules. In contrast to more symmetrical homologs, no ester tails longer than ethyl are necessary to induce the liquid crystalline state, allowing for the near&#8208;absence of any insulating and weight&#8208;increasing alkyl periphery. Films drop&#8208;cast from solution show in all cases emission spectra that do not show significant change of fluorescence emission upon annealing, indicating that the columnar hexagonal mesoscopic order is obtained directly upon deposition from solution and is resistant to crystallization upon annealing.

Abstract
In a solid catalyst with ionic liquid layer (SCILL), ionic liquid (IL) coatings are used to improve the selectivity of noble metal catalysts. To understand the origins of this selectivity control, we performed model studies by surface science methods in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV). We investigated the growth and thermal stability of ultrathin IL films by infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS). We combined these experiments with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to obtain information on the orientation of the ions, the interactions with the surface, the intermolecular interactions, and the structure formation. Additionally, we performed DFT calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to interpret the experimental data. We studied the IL 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate [C2C1Im][OTf] on Au(111) surfaces. We observe a weakly bound multilayer of [C2C1Im][OTf], which is stable up to 390&#8197;K, while the monolayer desorbs at &#8764;450&#8197;K. [C2C1Im][OTf] preferentially adsorbs at the step edges and elbows of the herringbone reconstruction of Au(111). The anion adsorbs via the SO3 group with the molecular axis perpendicular to the surface. At low coverage, the [C2C1Im][OTf] crystallizes in a glass&#8208;like 2D phase with short&#8208;range order. At higher coverage, we observe a phase transition to a 6&#8208;membered ring structure with long&#8208;range order.

A novel method for preparing mono&#8208; and di&#8208;alkylated ring&#8208;fused quinazolinones from alkene&#8208;substituted quinazolinones via chemodivergent tandem radical cyclization under metal&#8208; and base&#8208;free conditions has been established.







Abstract
Chemodivergent tandem radical cyclization offers exciting possibilities for the synthesis of structurally diverse cyclic compounds. Herein, we revealed a chemodivergent tandem cyclization of alkene&#8208;substituted quinazolinones under metal&#8208; and base&#8208;free conditions, this transformation is initiated by alkyl radicals produced from oxidant&#8208;induced &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization of alkyl nitriles or esters. The reaction resulted in the selective synthesis of a series of mono&#8208; and di&#8208;alkylated ring&#8208;fused quinazolinones by modulating the loading of oxidant, reaction temperature, and reaction time. Mechanistic investigations show that the mono&#8208;alkylated ring&#8208;fused quinazolinones is constructed by the key process of 1,2&#8208;hydrogen shift, whereas the di&#8208;alkylated ring&#8208;fused quinazolinones is mainly achieved through crucial steps of resonance and proton transfer. This protocol is the first example of remote second alkylation on the aromatic ring via &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization and difunctionalization achieved by association of two unsaturated bonds in radical cyclization.

Electrochemical nitrogen reduction: This work delineates the mechanism for electrochemical nitrogen reduction and competing Hydrogen evolution over a tri&#8208;nuclear Ni molecular catalyst [Ni3S8]2&#8722; by conducting a DFT study. Its interesting selectivity towards N2H4 over NH3 was reflected by our calculated pathways. We suggest weak N2 activation by Ni is responsible for such unusual selectivity.







Abstract
Conversion of N2 to the energy vector N2H4 under benign conditions is highly desirable. However, such N2 fixation processes are extremely rare. It has been recently reported that N2 to N2H4 conversion can be achieved electrochemically by using a trinuclear [Ni3(S2C3H6)4]2&#8722; complex (named as [Ni3S8]2&#8722;). There are hardly any precedents of Nitrogen Reduction Reaction (NRR) by molecular catalysts having Ni and the highly unusual selectivity for N2H4 over NH3 makes this electrochemical reduction unique. A systematic theoretical study employing calibrated Density Functional Theory to unearth the mechanisms of NRR (4e&#8722;/4H+) and Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (2e&#8722;/2H+) was conducted for the aforementioned trinuclear Ni complex. Our findings unravel a curious case of ligand lability working in tandem with metal centers in facilitating this unprecedented electrocatalytic activity. Furthermore, it is shown that the poor N&#8722;N bond activation property of Ni is responsible for this unusual selectivity. Additionally, the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) mechanistic pathways have also been delineated in this report. The mechanistic intricacies thus unearthed in this study may assist in developing more efficient electrocatalysts for N2H4 production through NRR.

The first case of successful suppression of the coordination of a lithium atom with a dialkylamino group by the effective conjugation of the latter with the aromatic core has been discovered on the example of the bromine&#8722;lithium exchange in 4,6,7,9&#8208;tetrabromo&#8208;1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;perimidine. Experimental results are explained by means of quantum chemical calculations.







Abstract
The first case of successful suppression of the coordination of a lithium atom with a dialkylamino group by the effective conjugation of the latter with the aromatic core has been discovered. This effect controls regioselectivity of the bromine&#8722;lithium exchange in 4,6,7,9&#8208;tetrabromo&#8208;1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;perimidine, which leads to products with the most effective conjugation. As a result, the product of this quadruple exchange demonstrates no tendency of the coordination of the NMe groups to neighboring lithium atoms despite the absence of steric restrictions. Experimental results are explained by means of quantum chemical calculations: geometry optimization, natural bond analysis and scans using the modredundant scheme.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Derived Cu&#8722;Ag Interface for Selective Carbon Monoxide Electroreduction to Acetate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 46, August 15, 2023. </description>

Ag&#8208;modified CuMOF&#8208;74 (Ag0.10@CuMOF&#8208;74) has been synthesized for highly selective CO electroreduction with Faradaic efficiency for C2+ products up to 90.4&#8201;% and an acetate Faradaic efficiency of 61.1&#8201;%. The introduction of Ag to CuMOF&#8208;74 is beneficial to create abundant excellent Cu&#8722;Ag interface sites, in which the adsorption of key intermediates is optimized and the C&#8722;C coupling is promoted, thus favoring the formation of acetate.







Abstract
Electrochemical carbon monoxide reduction reaction (CORR) is a potential way to obtain high&#8208;value multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products. However, achieving high selectivity to acetate is still a challenge. Herein, we develop a two&#8208;dimensional Ag&#8208;modified Cu metal&#8211;organic framework (Ag0.10@CuMOF&#8208;74) that demonstrates Faradaic efficiency (FE) for C2+ products up to 90.4&#8201;% at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and an acetate FE of 61.1&#8201;% with a partial current density of 122.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Detailed investigations show that the introduction of Ag on CuMOF&#8208;74 favors the generation of abundant Cu&#8722;Ag interface sites. In situ attenuated total reflection surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy confirms that these Cu&#8722;Ag interface sites improve the coverage of *CO and *CHO and the coupling between each other and stabilize key intermediates *OCCHO and *OCCH2, thus significantly promoting to the acetate selectivity on Ag0.10@CuMOF&#8208;74. This work provides a high&#8208;efficiency pathway for CORR to C2+ products.

Quadruple N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene/cobalt/photoredox/Br&#248;nsted base catalysis is demonstrated, realizing branch&#8208;selective hydroacylation of styrenes with aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes. This protocol allows to access branched ketones from readily available materials in an atom&#8208;economical manner. The quadruple catalysis can transfer a formyl hydrogen of aldehydes as hydrogen radical equivalent onto terminal carbon of alkene by controlled electron and proton transfers.

         <title>Smart Wearable Patches Using Light&#8208;Controlled Activation and Delivery of Photoswitchable Antimicrobial Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 46, August 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This unique proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept strategy is the first to combine photoisomerization and photocaging to regulate antibacterial activity and reduce toxicity. Concomitant light&#8208;controlled activation and delivery of an active antimicrobial peptide from a wearable patch via photolysis of a photocleavable linker allows topical delivery to the site of infection. The active agent can be deactivated immediately, potentially minimizing antimicrobial resistance.







Abstract
A novel strategy to treat Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) skin infections is presented, where UV light is used to facilitate concomitant light&#8208;controlled activation and delivery of an antimicrobial therapeutic agent. Specifically, a new photoswitchable gramicidin S analogue was immobilized onto a polymeric wearable patch via a photocleavable linker that undergoes photolysis at the same wavelength of light required for activation of the peptide. Unlike toxic gramicidin S, the liberated active photoswitchable peptide exhibits antimicrobial activity against S. aureus while being ostensibly non&#8208;haemolytic to red blood cells. Moreover, irradiation with visible light switches off the antimicrobial properties of the peptide within seconds, presenting an ideal strategy to regulate antibiotic activity for localized bacterial infections with the potential to mitigate resistance.

Concomitant light-controlled activation and delivery of an active antimicrobial peptide from a wearable patch via photolysis of a photocleavable linker allows topical delivery to the site of infection. The active agent can be deactivated immediately, potentially minimizing antimicrobial resistance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel strategy to treat &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt;) skin infections is presented, where UV light is used to facilitate concomitant light-controlled activation and delivery of an antimicrobial therapeutic agent. Specifically, a new photoswitchable gramicidin S analogue was immobilized onto a polymeric wearable patch via a photocleavable linker that undergoes photolysis at the same wavelength of light required for activation of the peptide. Unlike toxic gramicidin S, the liberated active photoswitchable peptide exhibits antimicrobial activity against &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; while being ostensibly non-haemolytic to red blood cells. Moreover, irradiation with visible light switches off the antimicrobial properties of the peptide within seconds, presenting an ideal strategy to regulate antibiotic activity for localized bacterial infections with the potential to mitigate resistance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis of l&#8208;Methionine Analogues and Application in a Methyltransferase Catalysed Alkylation Cascade
</title>

O&#8208;acetyl&#8208;l&#8208;homoserine sulfhydrolase is used for the production of l&#8208;methionine analogues from l&#8208;homocysteine and off&#8208;the shelf organic thiols. Combined with methyltransferase&#8208;catalysed alkylation cascades, this enables the transfer of a wide range of moieties onto various substrates.







Abstract
Chemical modification of small molecules is a key step for the development of pharmaceuticals. S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine (SAM) analogues are used by methyltransferases (MTs) to transfer alkyl, allyl and benzyl moieties chemo&#8208;, stereo&#8208; and regioselectively onto nucleophilic substrates, enabling an enzymatic way for specific derivatisation of a wide range of molecules. l&#8208;Methionine analogues are required for the synthesis of SAM analogues. Most of these are not commercially available. In nature, O&#8208;acetyl&#8208;l&#8208;homoserine sulfhydrolases (OAHS) catalyse the synthesis of l&#8208;methionine from O&#8208;acetyl&#8208;l&#8208;homoserine or l&#8208;homocysteine, and methyl mercaptan. Here, we investigated the substrate scope of ScOAHS from Saccharomyces cerevisiae for the production of l&#8208;methionine analogues from l&#8208;homocysteine and organic thiols. The promiscuous enzyme was used to synthesise nine different l&#8208;methionine analogues with modifications on the thioether residue up to a conversion of 75&#8201;%. ScOAHS was combined with an established MT dependent three&#8208;enzyme alkylation cascade, allowing transfer of in total seven moieties onto two MT substrates. For ethylation, conversion was nearly doubled with the new four&#8208;enzyme cascade, indicating a beneficial effect of the in&#8197;situ production of l&#8208;methionine analogues with ScOAHS.

         <title>Comprehensive Study and Development of a Metal&#8208;Free and Mild Nucleophilic Trifluoromethoxylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 46, August 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;free trifluoromethoxylation by nucleophilic substitution under mild conditions was developed based on the inexpensive DNTFB/DMAP system. An efficient rationalization was developed to propose optimal conditions depending on the characteristics of the starting substrates. A mechanistic study proved the crucial role of potassium salts in the transient formation of the CF3OK species, which has promising properties.







Abstract
Among the general interest in fluorinated compounds, trifluoromethoxylated molecules play a specific role. However, despite this interest, the development of efficient reagents to perform trifluoromethoxylation reactions remains a challenge. Here, 2,4&#8208;dinitro&#8208;trifluoromethoxybenzene (DNTFB) is used as a trifluoromethoxylating reagent to perform nucleophilic substitution under mild metal&#8208;free conditions with different leaving groups, including direct dehydroxytrifluoromethoxylation. A mechanistic study rationalized the reaction and subsequently proposed only three reaction conditions, depending on the reactivity of the starting substrates.

         <title>Synthesis of Neuraminidase&#8208;Resistant Sialyllactose Mimetics from N&#8208;Acyl Mannosamines using Metabolically Engineered Escherichia coli</title>

         <dc:description>
Sialyllactose mimetics showing lectin affinity but resistant to neuraminidase hydrolysis were produced on a gram scale from N&#8208;acyl&#8208;mannosamines using metabolically engineered E. coli cells.







Abstract
Herein, we describe the efficient gram&#8208;scale synthesis of &#945;2,3&#8208; and &#945;2,6&#8208;sialyllactose oligosaccharides as well as mimetics from N&#8208;acyl mannosamines and lactose in metabolically engineered bacterial cells grown at high cell density. We designed new Escherichia coli strains co&#8208;expressing sialic acid synthase and N&#8208;acylneuraminate cytidylyltransferase from Campylobacter jejuni together with the &#945;2,3&#8208;sialyltransferase from Neisseria meningitidis or the &#945;2,6&#8208;sialyltransferase from Photobacterium sp. JT&#8208;ISH&#8208;224. Using their mannose transporter, these new strains actively internalized N&#8208;acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) and its N&#8208;propanoyl (N&#8208;Prop), N&#8208;butanoyl (N&#8208;But) and N&#8208;phenylacetyl (N&#8208;PhAc) analogs and converted them into the corresponding sialylated oligosaccharides, with overall yields between 10&#8201;% and 39&#8201;% (200&#8208;700&#8197;mg.L&#8722;1 of culture). The three &#945;2,6&#8208;sialyllactose analogs showed similar binding affinity for Sambucus nigra SNA&#8722;I lectin as for the natural oligosaccharide. They also proved to be stable competitive inhibitors of Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase. These N&#8208;acyl sialosides therefore hold promise for the development of anti&#8208;adhesion therapy against influenza viral infections.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Boranes: Dual Reagents for the Synthesis of Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 46, August 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
NHC&#8208;boranes are demonstrated to be efficient dual reagents, as both reducing agent and source of surface ligands, for the synthesis of NHC&#8208;coated gold nanoparticles. This strategy allows the synthesis of spherical and monodisperse AuNPs of variable sizes by adjusting the gold to NHC&#8208;borane ratio. The NHC&#8208;boranes can also be exploited in a seeded growth process, a strategy never before reported with NHC stabilized gold nanoparticles. The protocol is simple, operates under mild conditions and avoids the use of extensive purification methods.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have drawn considerable interest in the field of nanomaterials chemistry as highly stabilizing ligands enabling the formation of strong and covalent carbon&#8211;metal bonds. Applied to gold nanoparticles synthesis, the most common strategy consists of the reduction of a preformed NHC&#8208;AuI complex with a large excess of a reducing agent that makes the particle size difficult to control. In this paper, we report the straightforward synthesis of NHC&#8208;coated gold nanoparticles (NHC&#8208;AuNPs) by treating a commercially available gold(I) precursor with an easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize NHC&#8208;BH3 reagent. The latter acts as both the reducing agent and the source of surface ligands operating under mild conditions. Mechanistic studies including NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry demonstrate that the reduction of gold(I) generates NHC&#8208;BH2Cl as a by&#8208;product. This strategy gives efficient control over the nucleation and growth of gold particles by varying the NHC&#8208;borane/gold(I) ratio, allowing unparalleled particle size variation over the range of 4.9&#177;0.9 to 10.0&#177;2.7&#8197;nm. Our strategy also allows an unprecedented precise and controlled seeded growth of gold nanoparticles. In addition, the as&#8208;prepared NHC&#8208;AuNPs exhibit narrow size distributions without the need for extensive purification or size&#8208;selectivity techniques, and are stable over months.

The latter acts as both the reducing agent and the source of surface ligands operating under mild conditions. Mechanistic studies including NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry demonstrate that the reduction of gold(I) generates NHC-BH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl as a by-product. This strategy gives efficient control over the nucleation and growth of gold particles by varying the NHC-borane/gold(I) ratio, allowing unparalleled particle size variation over the range of 4.9&#177;0.9 to 10.0&#177;2.7&#8197;nm. Our strategy also allows an unprecedented precise and controlled seeded growth of gold nanoparticles. In addition, the as-prepared NHC-AuNPs exhibit narrow size distributions without the need for extensive purification or size-selectivity techniques, and are stable over months.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A series of donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;donor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D) compounds based on naphthalendiimide (NDI) and perylenediimide (PDI) central cores combined with triphenylamine and phenylcarbazole donor groups have been synthesized, characterized and tested in top&#8208;contact/bottom gate organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). The results showed high electron mobilities, up to 0.3&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, in the case of NDI derivatives and moderate values of around 10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 for PDI&#8208;based semiconductors. Quantum chemical calculations were performed in order to support the experimental data. The results suggest that adequate molecular characteristics and larger crystalline domains in NDI vs. PDI semiconducting films may be the reasons behind the enhanced electrical properties of NDI derivatives. Furthermore, when the lateral donor substituents are triphenylamine groups, the mobilities were slightly higher in comparison to phenylcarbazole donor groups due to an improved electron&#8208;donating character. Other characterization techniques, such as AFM, X&#8208;ray diffraction or spectroelectrochemistry, among others, have been performed to analyze supramolecular order, charge carriers&#8217; nature and stability, parameters closely related to charge transport characteristics.

         <title>Amide Skeletal Elongation via Amino Acid Insertion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 46, August 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new amide bond activation paradigm through amino acid insertion enabled by two tandem intramolecular rearrangements is reported. This strategy only requires stable and readily available amide and amino acid as the starting materials, which does not need any pre&#8208;functionalization as well as the isolation of reaction intermediates.







Abstract
Amide derivatization is useful to access valuable organic compounds considering the ready availability of molecules containing amide functionality. Current methods to derivatize amide mainly focus on the synthesis of carbonyl&#8208;containing compounds and amines. Incorporating both parts of the initial amide into the new derivatives is rare. Herein, we describe a simple and practical amide derivatization through amino acid insertion to prepare more complex amides. This insertion is applicable to a wide range of amino acids and more importantly, the chiral information is completely conserved during the insertion. Comparison of this insertion strategy with conventional amide synthesis demonstrates the synthetic advantages of this new protocol.

         <title>Cover Feature: Photochemically Mediated Toluene Oxidation through a Copper Complex (Chem. Eur. J. 46/2023)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 46, August 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under ambient conditions, toluene can be oxidized selectively to benzaldehyde, an essential compound in the chemical industry. Copper(I) complexes were applied in combination with [Ru(bipy)3](PF6)2 and dioxygen as the oxidant. A peroxido copper complex is formed as the active species. The copper(II) complex obtained after oxidation can be photochemically reduced to the starting copper(I) species, and the process can be repeated. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. No&#223;, R. G&#246;ttlich, and S. Schindler (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301142).

The hand in the cover depicts how spin&#8208;crossover&#8208;active CoII complexes are held together by noncovalent fluorine&#8208;specific interactions between the perfluorinated alkyl chains on the ligand backbone. Once the hand releases the molecules into certain solvents, the fluorine&#8208;specific interactions are broken up through preferential interactions with the solvent molecules, which are present in large excess. More information can be found in the Research Article by J. van&#8197;Slageren, B. Sarkar and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301246).

         <title>Acidic CO2 Electrolysis Addressing the &#8220;Alkalinity Issue&#8221; and Achieving High CO2 Utilization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 46, August 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Currently, CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) mainly adopt alkaline or neutral electrolytes to suppress the hydrogen evolution (HER), but with significant drawback of (bi)carbonate crossover, leading to low carbon utilization efficiency. CO2RR in acidic electrolytes can alleviate the &#8220;alkalinity problem&#8221;, but the competing HER is more kinetically favourable. Thus, it is a priority to effectively suppress HER and accelerate acidic CO2 electrolysis.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) provides a promising approach for sustainable chemical fuel production of carbon neutrality. Neutral and alkaline electrolytes are predominantly employed in the current electrolysis system, but with striking drawbacks of (bi)carbonate (CO32&#8722;/HCO3&#8722;) formation and crossover due to the rapid and thermodynamically favourable reaction between hydroxide (OH&#8722;) with CO2, resulting in low carbon utilization efficiency and short&#8208;lived catalysis. Very recently, CO2RR in acidic media can effectively address the (bi)carbonate issue; however, the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is more kinetically favourable in acidic electrolytes, which dramatically reduces CO2 conversion efficiency. Thus, it is a big challenge to effectively suppress HER and accelerate acidic CO2RR. In this review, we begin by summarizing the recent progress of acidic CO2 electrolysis, discussing the key factors limiting the application of acidic electrolytes. We then systematically discuss addressing strategies for acidic CO2 electrolysis, including electrolyte microenvironment modulation, alkali cations adjusting, surface/interface functionalization, nanoconfinement structural design, and novel electrolyzer exploitation. Finally, the new challenges and perspectives of acidic CO2 electrolysis are suggested. We believe this timely review can arouse researchers&#8242; attention to CO2 crossover, inspire new insights to solve the &#8220;alkalinity problem&#8221; and enable CO2RR as a more sustainable technology.

         <title>Probing Interactions Between Chiral Plasmonic Nanoparticles and Biomolecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral plasmonic nanoparticles (and their assemblies) interact with biomolecules in a variety of different ways, resulting in distinct optical signatures when probed using circular dichroism spectroscopy. These systems show promise for biosensing applications and offer several advantages over achiral plasmonic systems. Arguably, the most notable advantage is that chiral nanoparticles can differentiate between molecular enantiomers and can, therefore, act as sensors for enantiomeric purity. Furthermore, chiral nanoparticles can couple more effectively to chiral biomolecules in biological systems if they have a matching handedness, improving their effectiveness as biomedical agents. In this article, we review the different types of interactions that occur between chiral plasmonic nanoparticle systems and biomolecules, discuss how circular dichroism spectroscopy can probe these interactions, and inform how to optimize systems for biosensing and biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Effects of Fluorinated functionalization of Linker on Quercetin Encapsulation, Release and Hela Cell Cytotoxicity of Cu&#8208;Based MOFs as Smart pH&#8208;Stimuli Nanocarriers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlled delivery of target molecules is required in many medical and chemical applications. For such purposes, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with high porosity, large surface area, and tunable functionalities are promising carriers. Herein, Quercetin (QU), as an anticancer drug, was loaded on Cu2(BDC)2(DABCO) and Cu2(F4BDC)2)DABCO) MOFs. As these Cu&#8208;MOFs have a high surface area, a suitable pore size, and biocompatible ingredients, they can be utilized to deliver QU. &#160;The loading efficiency of QU in these MOFs was 49.5% and 41.3%, respectively. The drug&#8208;loaded compounds displayed sustained drug release over 15 days, remarkably high drug loading capacities and pH&#8208;controlled release behavior. The prepared nanostructures were characterized by different characterization technics including FT&#8208;IR, PXRD, ZP, TEM, FE&#8208;SEM, UV&#8208;vis, and BET. In addition, MTT assays were carried out on HeLa and HEK&#8208;293 cell lines to investigate cytotoxicity. Cellular apoptosis analysis was performed to investigate the cell death mechanisms. Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to analyze the interactions between MOFs and QU. Moreover, the stability of MOFs was also investigated during and after the drug release process. Ultimately, kinetic models of drug release were evaluated.</dc:description>

         <title>Vapor&#8208;Induced Assembly of a Platinum(II) Complex Loaded on Layered Double Hydroxide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlled self&#8208;assembly of Pt(II) complexes is key to the development of optical and stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, but designing and precisely controlling them is still difficult owing to weak intermolecular interactions. Herein, we report the successful water&#8208;vapor&#8208;induced assembly of an anionic Pt(II) complex [Pt(CN)2(ppy)]&#8211; (Hppy = 2&#8208;phenylpyridine) electrostatically loaded on cationically charged layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoparticles consisting of Mg2+ and Al3+ ions. When the Pt(II) complexes were densely loaded onto the LDH nanoparticles, the assembly was maintained, even in dilute aqueous media. In the case of sparse loading, the Pt(II) complexes were loaded discretely in the dry state; however, when water vapor was adsorbed, the increased mobility of the Pt(II) complexes led to their assembly on the LDH nanoparticles. This resulted in a drastic change in luminescence from green to orange owing to the presence of water vapor.</dc:description>

         <title>Vanadium(V) pyridine&#8208;containing Schiff base catecholate complexes are novel lipophilic, redox&#8208;active and selectively cytotoxic in glioblastoma (T98g) cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two new series of complexes with pyridine&#8208;containing Schiff bases, [VVO(SALIEP)L] and [VVO(Cl&#8208;SALIEP)L] (SALIEP = N&#8208;(salicylideneaminato)&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethylpyridine; Cl&#8208;SALIEP = N&#8208;(5&#8208;chlorosalicylideneaminato)&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethylpyridine, L = catecholato(2&#8208;) ligand) were synthesized. Characterization by 1H and 51V NMR and UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopies confirmed that: 1) most complexes form two major geometric isomers in solution, and [VVO(SALIEP)(DTB)] (DTB = di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcatecholato(2&#8208;)) forms two isomers that equilibrate in solution; and 2) tert&#8208;butyl substituents was necessary to stabilize the reduced V(IV) species (EPR spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry). The pyridine moiety within the Schiff base ligands significantly changed their chemical properties with unsubstituted catecholate ligands compared with the parent HSHED (N&#8208;(salicylideneaminato)&#8208;N&#714;&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)&#8208;1,2&#8208;ethanediamine) Schiff base complexes. Immediate reduction to V(IV) occurred for the unsubstituted&#8208;catecholato V(V) complexes on dissolution in DMSO. By contrast, the pyridine moiety within the Schiff base significantly improved the hydrolytic stability of [VVO(SALIEP)(DTB)] compared with [VVO(HSHED)(DTB)]. [VVO(SALIEP)(DTB)] had moderate stability in cell culture media. There was significant cellular uptake of the intact complex by T98g (human glioblastoma) cells and very good anti&#8208;proliferative activity (IC50 6.7 &#177; 0.9 &#956;M, 72 h), which was ~five&#8208;fold higher compared with the non&#8208;cancerous human cell line, HFF&#8208;1 (IC50 34 &#177; 10 &#956;M). This made it a potential drug candidate for the treatment of advanced gliomas by intracranial injections.</dc:description>

         <title>Multifunctional Roles of Clathrate Hydrates Nanoreactors for CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we explore a possible platform for the CO2 reduction (CO2R) in one of water&#8217;s solid phases, namely clathrate hydrates (CHs), by ab initio molecular dynamics and well&#8208;tempered metadynamics simulations with periodic boundary conditions. We find that the stacked H2O nanocages in CHs assist to initialize CO2R by increasing the electron&#8208;binding ability of CO2. The substantial CO2R processes are further influenced by the hydrogen bond (H&#8208;bond) networks in CHs. The first intermediate CO2&#8722; in this process can be stabilized through cage structure reorganization into the H&#8208;bonded [CO2&#8722;&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#8208;OHcage] complex. Further cooperative structural dynamics enables the complex to convert into a vital transient [CO22&#8722;&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#8208;OHcage] intermediate via a low&#8208;barrier disproportionation&#8208;like process. Such a highly reactive intermediate spontaneously triggers sequent double proton transfer along its tethering H&#8208;bonds, finally converting it into HCOOH. These hydrogen&#8208;bonded nanoreactors feature multifunction in facilitating CO2R such as confining, tethering, H&#8208;bond catalyzing and proton pump. Our findings have a general interest and extend the knowledge of CO2R into porous aqueous systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Gated Photochromism of Dithienylethene&#8208;embeded Expanded Calixphyrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dithienylethene (DTE)&#8208;embedded expanded porphyrins were synthesized and confirmed to be photochemically inactive due to the lowest excited state of the expanded porphyrins. On the other hand, DTE&#8208;embedded expanded calixphyrins exhibited reversible photochromism upon UV&#8208;irradiation to form colored closed forms, which reverted to colorless open forms upon red&#8208;light irradiation. The closed forms were oxidized with DDQ or the air to lock the recorded information by converting to photochemically inactive expanded porphyrins. This was unlocked by reduction with NaBH4 to restore expanded calixphyrins with photochromism activity. These gated photochromic behaviors were demonstrated in PMMA film.</dc:description>

         <title>&#956;2&#8208;&#951;1:&#951;1&#8208;N2 Bridged Bimetallic Dinitrogen Complexes: Geometry of the First Excited State in Connection to N2 &#960;&#8208;Photoactivation</title>

However, the alternate N&#8211;N &#960;&#8208;photoactivation route has remained largely unexplored. Herein, we strengthen the notion of weakening the N&#8211;N bond through the population of &#960;* orbital upon electronic excitation from the ground to the first excited state using four prototypical complexes based on Fe (1), Mo (2), and Ru (3,4). The complexes 1&#8208;4 possess characteristic N&#8211;N &#960;* based LUMO (&#960;*&#8211;&#960;*&#8211;&#960;*) centered on their M&#8211;N&#8211;N&#8211;M core, which was earlier postulated to play a central role in the N2 photoactivation. Vertical electronic excitation of the highest oscillator strength involves transitions to the N&#8211;N &#960;*&#8208;based acceptor orbital (&#960;*&#8211;&#960;*&#8211;&#960;*) in complexes 1&#8208;4. This induces geometry relaxation of the first excited metal&#8208;to&#8208;nitrogen (&#960;*) charge transfer (1MNCT) state leading to a &#8220;zigzag&#8221; M&#8211;N&#8211;N&#8211;M core in the equilibrium structure. Obtaining the equilibrium geometry in the first excited state with the full&#8208;sized complexes widens the scope of N&#8211;N &#960;&#8208;photoactivation with &#956;2&#8208;&#951;1:&#951;1&#8208;N2 bridging dinitrogen complexes. Promisingly, the elongated N&#8211;N bond and bent MNN angle in the photoexcited S1 state of 1&#8208;4 resemble their radical&#8208; and di&#8208;anion forms, which lead toward thermodynamically feasible N&#8211;N protonation in the S1 excited state.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Diversified Penta&#8208;Spiro&#8208;Heterocyclic and Fused&#8208;Heterocyclic Frameworks with Potent Antitumor Activity</title>

This work applied Rh(III)&#8208;catalyst mediated substrate&#8208; and pH&#8208;controlled strategies to construct four novel types of complicated penta&#8208;spiro/fused&#8208;heterocyclic frameworks via C&#8722;H activation/[4+1] and [4+2] annulation cascades.







Abstract
Multiple&#8208;spiro/fused&#8208;heterocyclic frameworks containing indazolone are structurally unique and represent a class of potentially dominant skeletons.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple-spiro/fused-heterocyclic frameworks containing indazolone are structurally unique and represent a class of potentially dominant skeletons. In this work, we successfully fulfilled Rh(III)-catalyst mediated substrate- and pH- controlled strategies to construct four novel types of complicated penta-spiro/fused-heterocyclic frameworks via C&#8722;H activation/[4+1] and [4+2] annulation cascades. This method had mild reaction conditions, a broad scope of substrates, moderate to good yields, and valuable applications, which could realize for the first time the generation of the novel di-spiro-heterocyclic and multiple fused-heterocyclic products with unique structures. More importantly, novel spiro[cyclohexane-indazolo[1,2-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]indazole] scaffold constructed by this method exhibited potent antitumor activity against a variety of refractory solid tumors and hematological malignancies in&#8197;vitro. Overall, our work provided new insights into the construction of complex and diverse multiple spiro/fused-heterocyclic systems and offered novel valuable lead compounds for the discovery of antitumor drugs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Graphdiyne, as a novel type of carbon allostrope, possessing both a planar conjugated structure and a pore&#8208;like configuration in three&#8208;dimensional space. This review summarized various synthesis and modification methods of the GDY&#8208;based materials and their recent advances in energy storage are reviewed, including applications mainly in Li&#8208;ion and hydrogen storage devices, and the perspectives of the challenges and opportunities faced by GDY&#8208;based materials.







Abstract
Graphynes (GYs) are a novel type of carbon allotrope composed of sp and sp2 hybridized carbon atoms, boasting both a planar conjugated structure akin to graphene and a pore&#8208;like configuration in three&#8208;dimensional space. Graphdiyne (GDY), the first successfully synthesized member of GYs family, has gained much interest due to its fascinating electrochemical properties including a greater theoretical capacity, high charge mobility and advanced electronic transport properties, making it a promising material for energy storage applications for lithium&#8208;ion and hydrogen storage. Various methods, including heteroatom substitution, embedding, strain, and nanomorphology control, have been employed to further enhance the energy storage performance of GDY. Despite the potential of GDY in energy storage applications, there are still challenges to overcome in scaling up mass production. This review summarizes recent progress in the synthesis and application of GDY in lithium&#8208;ion and hydrogen storage, highlighting the obstacles faced in large&#8208;scale commercial application of GDY&#8208;based energy storage devices. Suggestions on possible solutions to overcome these hurdles have also been provided. Overall, the unique properties of GDY make it a promising material for energy storage applications in lithium&#8208;ion and hydrogen storage devices. The findings presented here will inspire further development of energy storage devices utilizing GDY.

         <title>Heterobimetallic Hydrides with a Germanium(II)&#8208;Zinc Bond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Addition of zinc hydride to the germanium(II) center results in zincagermanes with H&#8722;Zn&#8722;Ge&#8722;H core, which react with CO2 to give a digermylene and zinc formate.







Abstract
In the presence of TMEDA (TMEDA=N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetramethylethylenediamine), zinc dihydride reacted with germanium(II) compounds (BDI&#8722;H)Ge (1) and [(BDI)Ge][B(3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3)4] (3) (BDI&#8208;H = HC{(C=CH2)(CMe)(NAr)2}, BDI = [HC(CMeNAr)2]; Ar = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) by formal insertion of the germanium(II) center into the Zn&#8722;H bond of polymeric [ZnH2]n to give neutral and cationic zincagermane with a H&#8722;Ge&#8208;Zn&#8722;H core [(BDI&#8722;H)Ge(H)&#8208;(H)Zn(tmeda)] (2) and [(BDI)Ge(H)&#8208;(H)Zn(tmeda)][B(3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3)4] (4), respectively. Compound 2 eliminated [ZnH2] giving diamido germylene 1 at 60&#8201;&#176;C. Compound 2 and deuterated analogue 2&#8208;d2 exchanged with [ZnH2]n and [ZnD2]n in the presence of TMEDA to give a mixture of 2 and 2&#8208;d2. Compounds 2 and 4 reacted with carbon dioxide (1&#8197;bar) at room temperature to form zincagermane diformate [(BDI&#8722;H)Ge(OCHO)&#8208;(OCHO)Zn(tmeda)] (5) and formate bridged digermylene [({BDI}Ge)2(&#956;&#8208;OCHO)]+[B(C6H3(CF3)2)4] (6) along with zinc formate [(tmeda)Zn(&#956;&#8208;OCHO)3Zn(tmeda)][B(C6H3(CF3)2)4] (7), respectively. The hydridic nature of the Ge&#8722;H and Zn&#8722;H bonds in 2 and 4 was probed by reactions with Br&#246;nsted and Lewis acids.

         <title>A Blueprint for the Stabilization of Sub&#8208;Valent Alkaline Earth Complexes
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Group 2 metals are classically found in the +2 oxidation state and their sub&#8208;valent chemistry is hugely underdeveloped. Here we present a blueprint for a new approach towards the synthesis and stabilization of heavy Group 2 metals in the +1 oxidation state, based on the use of highly equatorial ligand environments (i.&#8201;e. trigonal planar, square planar). Our computational analysis highlights the potential role played by d&#8208;orbitals to access these species.







Abstract
The study of sub&#8208;valent Group 2 chemistry is a relatively new research field, being established in 2007 with the report of the first Mg(I) dimers. These species are stabilized by the formation of a Mg&#8722;Mg covalent bond; however, the extension of this chemistry to heavier alkaline earth (AE) metals has been frustrated by significant synthetic challenges, primarily associated with the instability of heavy AE&#8722;AE interactions. Here we present a new blueprint for the stabilization of heavy AE(I) complexes, based upon the reduction of AE(II) precursors with planar coordination geometries. We report the synthesis and structural characterisation of homoleptic trigonal planar AE(II) complexes of the monodentate amides {N(SiMe3)2}&#8722; and {N(Mes)(SiMe3)}&#8722;. DFT calculations showed that the LUMOs of these complexes all show some d&#8208;character for AE = Ca&#8722;Ba. DFT analysis of the square planar Sr(II) complex [Sr{N(SiMe3)2}(dioxane)2]&#8734; revealed analogous frontier orbital d&#8208;character. AE(I) complexes that could be accessed by reduction of these AE(II) precursors were modelled computationally, revealing exergonic formation in all cases. Crucially, NBO calculations show that some d&#8208;character is preserved in the SOMO of theoretical AE(I) products upon reduction, showing that d&#8208;orbitals could play a crucial role in achieving stable heavy AE(I) complexes.

         <title>Stereo&#8208;Controlled Synthesis of Vicinal Tertiary Carbinols: Application in the Synthesis of a Diol Substructure of Zaragozic Acid, Pactamycin and Ryanodol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general approach for the stereoselective synthesis of vicinal tertiary carbinols has been developed. This strategy featured stereoselective O21 [4+2] cycloaddition of designed cyclohexadienones followed by O&#8722;O and C&#8722;C bond cleavage. A versatile synthetic intermediate was prepared on practical scale as a potential precursor to a wide variety of vicinal tertiary carbinol containing compounds. Application of the developed strategy enabled entry to the highly advanced core structures of zaragozic acid, pactamycin and ryanodol.







Abstract
A novel and flexible approach for the stereo&#8208;controlled synthesis of vicinal tertiary carbinols is reported. The developed strategy featured a highly diastereoselective singlet&#8208;oxygen (O21) [4+2] cycloaddition of rationally designed cyclohexadienones (derived from oxidative dearomatization of the corresponding carboxylic&#8208;acid appended phenol precursors), followed by programmed &#8220;O&#8722;O&#8221; and &#8220;C&#8722;C&#8221; bond cleavage. In doing so, a highly functionalized and versatile intermediate was identified and prepared in synthetically useful quantity as a plausible precursor to access a variety of designed and naturally occurring vicinal tertiary carbinol containing compounds. Most notably, the developed strategy was successfully applied in the stereo&#8208;controlled synthesis of advanced core structures of zaragozic acid, pactamycin and ryanodol.

         <title>Quantifying Catalysis at the Origin of Life
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Origin of life theories often invoke catalytic mechanisms, but catalysis of biologically relevant reactions in geologically plausible scenarios has been until recently experimentally elusive. In this perspective, we suggest that researchers move toward decreased catalyst loading, increased yields, as well as before/after characterization of metals or minerals to demonstrate true catalysis.







Abstract
The construction of hypothetical environments to produce organic molecules such as metabolic intermediates or amino acids is the subject of ongoing research into the emergence of life. Experiments specifically focused on an anabolic approach typically rely on a mineral catalyst to facilitate the supply of organics that may have produced prebiotic building blocks for life. Alternatively to a true catalytic system, a mineral could be sacrificially oxidized in the production of organics, necessitating the emergent &#8216;life&#8217; to turn to virgin materials for each iteration of metabolic processes. The aim of this perspective is to view the current &#8216;metabolism&#8208;first&#8217; literature through the lens of materials chemistry to evaluate the need for higher catalytic activity and materials analyses. While many elegant studies have detailed the production of chemical building blocks under geologically plausible and biologically relevant conditions, few appear to do so with sub&#8208;stoichiometric amounts of metals or minerals. Moving toward sub&#8208;stoichiometric metals with rigorous materials analyses is necessary to demonstrate the viability of an elusive cornerstone of the &#8216;metabolism&#8208;first&#8217; hypotheses: catalysis. We emphasize that future work should aim to demonstrate decreased catalyst loading, increased productivity, and/or rigorous materials analyses for evidence of true catalysis.

         <title>A preference for heterolepticity &#8211; Schlenk type equilibria in organometallic beryllium systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactions of beryllium halides with diphenyl beryllium were investigated in the N&#8208; and O&#8208;donor solvents NEt3 and THF, as well as in benzene and dichloromethane in the presence of the Lewis basic ligands THF, NEt3 and N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes with various steric demand. In all cases the selective formation of heteroleptic beryllium Grignard compounds of the general formula [(L)1&#8208;2BePhX]1&#8208;2 (X = Cl, Br, I; L = C&#8208;, N&#8208;, O&#8208;donor ligand) was observed. The stability of these complexes was investigated computationally, while the differences between homo&#8208; and heteroleptic systems were also evaluated NMR spectroscopically and with single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Mechanistic studies on the formation and speciation of these beryllium Grignard complexes in solution were performed.</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;Soluble Arylazoisoxazole Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Azoheteroarenes are emerging as powerful alternatives to azobenzene molecular photoswitches. Herein, we introduce water&#8208;soluble arylazoisoxale photoswitches. UV/vis and NMR spectroscopy revealed moderate to very good photostationary states and reversible photoisomerization between the E&#8208; and Z&#8208;isomers over multiple cycles with minimal photobleaching. Several arylazoisoxales form host&#8208;guest complexes with &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin with significant differences in binding constants for each photoisomer as shown by isothermal titration calorimetry and NMR experiments, indicating their potential for photoresponsive host&#8208;guest chemistry in water. One carboxylic acid functionalized arylazoisoxale can act as a hydrogelator, allowing gel properties to be manipulated reversibly with light. The hydrogel was characterized by rheological experiments, atom force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. These results demonstrate that arylazoisoxazoles can find applications as molecular photoswitches in aqueous media.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Porous organic cages (POCs) are meanwhile an established class of porous materials. Most of them are soluble to a certain extend and thus processable in or from solution. However, a few of larger salicylimine cages were reported to be insoluble in any organic solvents and thus characterized as amorphous materials. These cages were now synthesized as single&#8208;crystalline materials to get insight into packing motifs and preferred intermolecular interactions.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two homologs of the diterpene synthase CotB2 from Streptomyces collinus (ScCotB2) and Streptomyces iakyrus (SiCotB2) were investigated for their products by in vitro incubations of the recombinant enzymes with geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, followed by compound isolation and structure elucidation by NMR. ScCotB2 produced the new compound collinodiene, besides the canonical CotB2 product cyclooctat&#8208;9&#8208;en&#8208;7&#8208;ol, dolabella&#8208;3,7,18&#8208;triene and dolabella&#8208;3,7,12&#8208;triene, while SiCotB2 gave mainly cyclooctat&#8208;9&#8208;en&#8208;7&#8208;ol and only traces of dolabella&#8208;3,7,18&#8208;triene. The cyclisation mechanism towards the ScCotB2 products and their absolute configurations were investigated through isotopic labelling experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Valence delocalization in carbon&#8208;bridged mixed&#8208;valence iron complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The carbide ligand in the iron&#8208;molybdenum cofactor (FeMoco) in nitrogenase bridges iron atoms in different oxidation states, yet it is difficult to discern its ability to mediate magnetic exchange interactions due to the structural complexity of the cofactor. Here, we describe two mixed&#8208;valent diiron complexes with C&#8208;based ketenylidene bridging ligands, and compare the carbon bridges with the more familiar sulfur bridges.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The carbide ligand in the iron-molybdenum cofactor (FeMoco) in nitrogenase bridges iron atoms in different oxidation states, yet it is difficult to discern its ability to mediate magnetic exchange interactions due to the structural complexity of the cofactor. Here, we describe two mixed-valent diiron complexes with C-based ketenylidene bridging ligands, and compare the carbon bridges with the more familiar sulfur bridges. The ground state of the [Fe2(m-CCO)2]+&#160;complex with two carbon bridges (4) is&#160;S&#160;= 1/2 and is valence delocalized on the M&#246;ssbauer timescale with a small thermal barrier for electron hopping that stems from the low Fe&#8211;C force constant. In contrast, one-electron reduction of the [Fe2(m-CCO)] complex with one carbon bridge (2) affords a mixed-valence species with a high-spin ground state (S&#160;= 7/2), and the Fe&#8211;Fe distance contracts by 1&#160;&#197;. Spectroscopic, magnetic, and computational studies of the latter reveal an Fe&#8211;Fe bonding interaction that leads to complete valence delocalization.

         <title>Selective Chirality Transfer to the Bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide Anion of an Ionic Liquid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective chirality transfer from the chiral (R)&#8208;1,2&#8208;propylene oxide to the bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide anion of an ionic liquid is observed, resulting in optical activity of the achiral anion as detected by calculated vibrational circular dichroism spectra.







Abstract
Chirality transfer from the chiral molecule (R)&#8208;1,2&#8208;propylene oxide to the achiral anion of the 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ionic liquid is observed. The chiral probe selectively affects one part of the binary ionic liquid, i.&#8201;e., it has previously been shown experimentally and theoretically that this particular imidazolium cation can be affected by chirality transfer, but in the present system chirality is almost exclusively transferred to the anion and not to both parts of the solvent (anion and cation). This observation is of high relevance because of its selectivity and because anion effects are usually much more important in ionic liquid research than cation effects. From ab&#8197;initio molecular dynamics simulations, a conformational analysis and dissected vibrational circular dichroism spectra are obtained to study the chirality transfer. While in the neat ionic liquid two mirror imaged trans conformers of the anion occur almost equally, we observe an excess of one of these conformers in the presence of the chiral solute, causing optical activity of the anion. Although the cis conformers are not tremendously affected by the chirality transfer, they gain in total population when (R)&#8208;1,2&#8208;propylene oxide is dissolved in the ionic liquid.

         <title>Through&#8208;Space, Lone&#8208;Pair Promoted Aromatic Substitution: A Relay Mechanism Can Beat Out Direct Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through stabilized &#8220;relay&#8221; tranisition states: Various Lewis basic functional groups can spatially activate aromatic substitutions. Mechanistically, these reactions proceed through an exothermic relay pathway, as opposed to the previously assumed endothermic direct activation. In this article, both experimental and theoretical models are employed to investigate this newly discovered mode of arene activation in detail.







Abstract
We report a detailed experimental and theoretical analysis of through&#8208;space arene activation with halogens, tetrazoles and achiral esters and amides. Contrary to previously assumed direct activation through &#963;&#8208;complex stabilization, our results suggest that these reactions proceed by a relay mechanism wherein the lone pair&#8208;containing activators form exothermic &#960;&#8208;complexes with electrophilic nitronium ion before transferring it to the probe ring through low barrier transition states. Noncovalent interactions (NCI) plots and Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) analyses depict favorable interactions between the Lewis base (LB) and the nitronium ion in the precomplexes and the transition states, suggesting directing group participation throughout the mechanism. The regioselectivity of substitution also comports with a relay mechanism. In all, these data pave the way for an alternate platform of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) reactions.

         <title>Cation Adaptive Structures Based on Manganese Cyanide Prussian Blue Analogues: Application of Powder Diffraction Data to Solve Complex, Unprecedented Stoichiometries and&#160;Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A Mn(II) salt and A+CN&#8208; under anaerobic conditions react to form extended structured compounds of AmMnIIn(CN)m+2n&#160;stoichiometry, e.g. AMnII3(CN)7, A2MnII3(CN)8, A2MnII5(CN)12, A3MnII5(CN)13, and A2MnII[MnII(CN)6]&#160;(A represents alkali and tetraalkylammonium cations).&#160;Cs2MnII[MnII(CN)6] has the typical Prussian blue face centered cubic unit cell. However, the other alkali salts are monoclinic or rhombohedral. This is in accord with smaller alkali cation radii creating void space that is minimized by increasing the van der Waals stabilization energy by reducing &#8736;Mn&#8211;N&#8801;C. This is attributed to the non&#8208;rigidity of the framework structure due the significant ionic character associated with the high&#8208;spin MnII sites. For larger tetraalkylammonium cations, the high&#8208;spin Mn sites lack sufficient electrostatic A+&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;NC stabilization and only form unexpected 4&#8208; and 5&#8208;coordinated Mn sites within a flexible, extended framework around the cation; hence, the size, shape, and charge of the cation dictate the unprecedented stoichiometry and unpredictable cation adaptive structures. Antiferromagnetic coupling between adjacent MnII sites leads to ferrimagnetic ordering, but in some cases antiferromagnetic coupling of ferrimagnetic layers are compensated and synthetic&#160;antiferromagnets are observed. The magnetic ordering temperatures for ferrimagnetic A2MnII[MnII(CN)6] with both octahedral high&#8208; and low&#8208;spin MnII sites increase with decreasing &#8736;Mn&#8211;N&#8801;C. The&#160;extended structured materials were obtained by powder diffraction.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A novel one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step multicomponent reaction has been achieved for the preparation of &#946;&#8208;CF3 enamines by using different aliphatic amines, propionates as starting material and CF3SO2Na.

         <title>Behavior of a Dynamic Covalent Library Driven by Combined Pd(II) and Biphasic Effectors for Metal Transport between Phases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we report the effect of Pd(II) as chemical effector on an acylhydrazone&#8208;based dynamic covalent library (DCL) in biphasic systems (water/chloroform). The constituents of the DCL are self&#8208;built and distributed in the two phases, two of them are lipophilic enough to play the role of a carrier agent that may transfer Pd(II) from the aqueous phase to the organic phase. Upon the addition of Pd(II), the DCL of components exhibits a strong amplification of the constituent that is the most adapted to stabilize Pd(II) in chloroform as well as its agonist in water. We demonstrated that this evolution is driven by the combination of the interaction of the DCL with Pd(II) and the presence of the two phases. This study paves the way to a novel approach for liquid/liquid extraction and metal recovery by means of adaptive extractant species generated in situ by a DCL.</dc:description>

         <title>A 3D Covalent Organic Framework with In&#8208;situ Formed Pd Nanoparticles for Efficient Electrochemical&#160;Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;platinum noble metals are highly desirable for the development of highly active, stable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts for fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries. However, how to improve the utilization of non&#8208;platinum noble metals is an urgent issue. Herein, a highly efficient catalyst for ORR was prepared through homogeneous loading of Pd precursors by a domain&#8208;limited method in a three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (COF) followed by pyrolysis. The morphology of the Pd nanoparticles (Pd NPs) was well maintained after carbonization, which was attributed to the rigid structure of the 3D COF. Thanks to the uniform distribution of Pd NPs in the carbon, the catalyst exhibited a remarkable half&#8208;wave potential of 0.906 V and a Tafel slope of 70 mV dec&#8208;1 in 0.1 M KOH, surpassing the commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.863 V and 75 mV dec&#8208;1). Furthermore, a maximum power density of 144.0 mW cm&#8722;2 was achieved at 252 mA cm&#8722;2, which was significantly higher than the control battery (105.1 mW cm&#8722;2). This work not only provides a simple strategy for in&#8208;situ preparation of highly dispersible metal catalysts in COFs, but also offers new insights into the ORR electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards Fast Circularly Polarized Luminescence in 2&#8208;Coordinate Chiral Mechanochromic Copper(I) Carbene Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of chiral and mechanochromic copper(I) TADF emitters with high radiative rate constants have been examined with regard to their chiroptical properties. Only the structurally flexible phenoxazine ligand generates circular polarized luminescence (CPL) in PMMA matrix presumably due to distortions in the ground and excited states, providing a design strategy for future CPL molecules.







Abstract
A series of chiral mechanochromic copper(I) cAAC (cAAC=cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene) complexes with a variety of amide ligands have been studied with regard to their photophysical and chiroptical properties to elucidate structure&#8208;property relationships for the design of efficient triplet exciton emitters exhibiting circularly polarized luminescence. Depending on the environment, which determines the excited state energies, either thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) from 1/3LLCT states or phosphorescence from 3LLCT/LC states occurs. However, neither chiral moieties at the carbene nor at the carbazolate ligands provide detectable luminescence dissymmetries glum. An exception is [Cu(phenoxazinyl)(cAAC)], showing orange to deep red TADF with &#955;max=601&#8211;715&#8197;nm in solution, powders and in PMMA. In this case, the amide ligand can undergo distortions in the excited state. This design motif leads to the first linear, non&#8208;aggregated CPL&#8208;active copper(I) complex with glum of &#8722;3.4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;3 combined with a high radiative rate constant of 6.7&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;105&#8197;s&#8722;1.

         <title>Alkylcyanoborate Anions: Building Blocks for Fluorine&#8208;Free Low&#8208;Viscosity, Electrochemically and Thermally Stable Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkylcyanoborate anions were found to be building blocks for fluorine&#8208;free ionic liquids with appealing properties with respect to potential applications in materials science especially for electrolyte chemistry. The influence of different types and number of alkyl chains on the IL properties has been elucidated.







Abstract
A set of mixed&#8208;substituted potassium alkylcyano&#8208; and alkylcyanofluoroborates has been synthesized using easily accessible starting compounds and characterized by elemental analysis, NMR and vibrational spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. In addition, single&#8208;crystal structures of salts of the cyanoborate anions have been derived from X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments. The 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium room temperature ionic liquids ([EMIm]+&#8208;RTILs) with the new borate anions have been synthesized and their physicochemical properties, that is, high thermal and electrochemical stability, low viscosity, and high conductivity, have been compared to the properties of related [EMIm]+&#8208;RTILs. The influence of the different alkyl substituents at boron has been assessed. The exemplary study on the properties with the [EMIm]+&#8208;ILs with the mixed water stable alkylcyanoborate anions points towards the potential of these fluorine&#8208;free borate anions, in general.

         <title>Covalently Modified Kevlar Fabric Incorporating Graphene Oxide with Enhanced Antibacterial Properties and Preserved Strength</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Straightforward covalent post&#8208;functionalization of Kevlar fabric incorporating GO nanosheets significantly enhances the antibacterial properties and preserves their strength.







Abstract
This work describes a multi&#8208;step modification process for the covalent transformation of Kevlar fabric en route to the incorporation of graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets. Spectroscopic, thermal and microscopy imaging techniques have been employed to follow step&#8208;by&#8208;step the modification of Kevlar and the formation of the corresponding Kevlar&#8208;GO hybrid fabric. The level of Kevlar's functionalization can be controlled with the nitration time, the first reaction in the multi&#8208;sequence organic transformations, for obtaining the hybrid fabric with a content of GO up to 30&#8201;%. Most importantly, the covalent post&#8208;modification of Kevlar does not occur in the expense of the other excellent mechanical properties of the fabric. Under optimal conditions, the Kevlar&#8208;GO hybrid fabric shows a 20&#8201;% enhancement of the ultimate strength. Notably, when the Kevlar&#8208;GO hybrid fabric was exposed to cyanobacterial Synechococcus the bacteria growth was fully inhibited. Overall, the covalently modified fabric demonstrated significant antibacterial behavior, excellent strength and stability under common processes. Due to its simplicity, the methodology presented in this work not only promises to result in a standard procedure to functionalize the mer units of Kevlar with a variety of chemicals and nanomaterials but it can be also extended for the modification and hybridization of other fabrics.

         <title>Flexible Self&#8208;Powered Energy Systems Based on H2O/Ni2+ Intercalated NixV2O5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;nH2O</title>

A flexible textile&#8208;based self&#8208;charging energy system was proposed and assembled by ZIHC and TENG, enabling the rapid harvesting and simultaneous storage of human movement energy for portable electronics. The fabricated NVO@CC//CC ZIHCs offer reliable scalability, tunable adaptability and excellent long&#8208;term and mechanical stability, demonstrates a wide voltage range of 2.0&#8197;V and a high area capacitance value of 267.1&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2. TENG is made by spin&#8208;coating PDMS on NVO@CC and achieves a maximum instantaneous power of 18.5&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and exhibits excellent flexibility and stability. The self&#8208;powered system can charge timers and electronic watches steadily for a long time by hand&#8208;tapping, proving self&#8208;charging power systems have great potential for applications in portable electronic devices.







Abstract
The development of portable electronic devices has created greater demands for multifunctional energy integration systems. Self&#8208;powered systems have gained widespread interest because they can collect and storage renewable environmental energy and provide stable electricity to electronic devices. Herein, we developed a flexible self&#8208;charging energy system, involving textile&#8208;based zinc&#8208;ion hybrid (ZIHC) and triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), which demonstrates wearable, compatibility, lightweight and can quickly harvest and store energy. NixV2O5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;nH2O (NVO) loaded on carbon cloth (CC) with Ni2+/H2O ions intercalated as the cathode was assembled with activated CC to form a ZIHC, which has a voltage range of 2.0&#8197;V and capacitance value of 267.1&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2 as well as good charge and discharge rates and excellent cycling stability. At the same time, the NVO/CC can be assembled with PDMS to form a TENG achieving a maximum instantaneous power of 18.5&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The device can be flexibly worn over the body to continuously harvest and store biomechanical energy and charge the electronic wristwatch successfully. This work demonstrates great convenience and promising practical applications as sustainable flexible energy system for portable electronic devices.

   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (NVO) loaded on carbon cloth (CC) with Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ions intercalated as the cathode was assembled with activated CC to form a ZIHC, which has a voltage range of 2.0&#8197;V and capacitance value of 267.1&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; as well as good charge and discharge rates and excellent cycling stability. At the same time, the NVO/CC can be assembled with PDMS to form a TENG achieving a maximum instantaneous power of 18.5&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The device can be flexibly worn over the body to continuously harvest and store biomechanical energy and charge the electronic wristwatch successfully.

         <title>Constructing Hierarchical Porous MoO2@Mo2N@C Composite via a Confined Pyrolysis Synthetic Strategy Towards Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel molybdenum&#8208;based oxyacid salt confined pyrolysis strategy was proposed to construct hierarchical porous MoO2@Mo2N@C composite. Owing to the unique structure and abundant active sites, MoO2@Mo2N@C composite exhibit excellent lithium storage properties as anode materials.







Abstract
Molybdenum dioxide (MoO2) demonstrates a big potential toward lithium&#8208;ion storage due to its high theoretical capacity. The sluggish reaction kinetics and large volume change during cycling process, however, unavoidably lead to inferior electrochemical performance, thus failing to satisfy the requirements of practical applications. Herein, we developed a molybdenum&#8208;based oxyacid salt confined pyrolysis strategy to achieve a novel hierarchical porous MoO2@Mo2N@C composite. A two&#8208;step successive annealing process was proposed to obtain a hybrid phase of MoO2 and Mo2N, which was used to further improve the electrochemical performance of MoO2&#8208;based anode. We demonstrate that the well&#8208;dispersed MoO2 nanoparticles can ensure ample active sites exposure to the electrolyte, while conductive Mo2N quantum dots afford pseudo&#8208;capacitive response, which conduces to the migration of ions and electrons. Additionally, the interior voids could provide buffer spaces to surmount the effect of volume change, thereby avoiding the fracture of MoO2 nanoparticles. Benefiting from the aforesaid synergies, the as&#8208;obtained MoO2@Mo2N@C electrode demonstrates a striking initial discharge capacity (1760.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and decent long&#8208;term cycling stability (652.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). This work provides a new way for the construction of advanced anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Preparation of Buffered Nano&#8208;Submicron Hierarchical Structure Hollow SiOx@C Anodes for Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Materials with Carboxymethyl Chitosan</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silicon&#8208;based material SiOx@C with nano&#8208;submicron hierarchical structure from nano silicon and hollow silicon dioxide is fabricated to buffer the volume change of silicon&#8208;based anodes, improve the electronic conductivity and achieve more stable cycling performance.







Abstract
Silicon&#8208;based materials are among the most promising anode materials for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the volume expansion and poor conductivity of silicon&#8208;based materials during the charge and discharge process seriously hinder their practical application in the field of anodes. Here, we choose carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) as the carbon source coating and binding on the surface of nano silicon and hollow silicon dioxide (H&#8722;SiO2) to form a hierarchical buffered structure of nano&#8208;hollow SiOx@C. The hollow H&#8722;SiO2 can alleviate the volume expansion of nano silicon during the lithiation process under continuous cycling. Meanwhile, the carbon layer carbonized by CMCS containing N&#8208;doping further regulates the silicon's expansion and improves the conductivity of the active materials. The as&#8208;
prepared SiOx@C material exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 985.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with the decay rate of 0.27&#8201;% per cycle in 150 cycles under the current density of 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. It is proved that the hierarchical buffer structure nano&#8208;hollow SiOx@C anode material has practical application potential.

         <dc:description>
Multiply exo&#8208;methylated corannulenes have been synthesized by in&#8208;situ iterative reduction/methylation sequences that involve the reduction of corannulenes using sodium to form the anionic corannulene species and the subsequent SN2 reaction of the anionic species with reduction&#8208;resistant dimethyl sulfate. Corannulenes with/without methyl groups, dimethyl sulfate, and sodium are shown as flowers, butterflies, and the soil, respectively.

         <title>Unexpected Coexisting Solid Solutions in the Quasi&#8208;binary Ag(II)F2/Cu(II)F2 Phase Diagram</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the presence of F2 overpressure, at elevated temperature, and despite the similarity of their crystal structures, CuF2 and AgF2 unexpectedly form two distinct solid solutions, (Cu1&#8722;xAgx)F2 and (Ag1&#8722;xCux)F2. Each phase shows different mutual solubility of Cu2+ and Ag2+ (shown as yellow and violet balls), and their magnetic properties are strongly impacted by this seemingly simple isoelectronic substitution.

         <title>Impact of Catalyst Deuteration on the Reactivity of Chiral Phase&#8208;Transfer Organocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating deuteriums into the correct positions of organocatalysts increases their stability and robustness, just like the story of &#8220;The Three Little Pigs&#8221;: the first two pigs hastily construct houses made of straw and sticks (non&#8208;deuterated and dideuterated catalysts), but they were quickly destroyed by the wolf&#8242;s huffing and puffing (OH&#8722;). In contrast, the third pig took time to build a sturdy house made of bricks (tetradeuterated catalyst), and the brick house remained intact. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y.&#8197;Liu, H.&#8197;Naka, K.&#8197;Maruoka and co&#8208;workers. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301866).

The cover shows super sodium ionic conductivity in polyanion&#8208;added sodium zirconium chloride&#8208;based compound. A new highway was discovered for sodium ions to migrate towards cathode. Na0.67Zr(SO4)0.33Cl4 showed a high ionic conductivity of 1.6&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. The conductivity might be dominated by the electronegativity of the central atom of the polyanion. More information can be found in the Research Article by A.&#8197;Inoishi and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Catalysis by KDM6 Histone Demethylases &#8208; A Synergy between the Non&#8208;Heme Iron(II) Center, Second Coordination Sphere, and Long&#8208;Range Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The demethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 is catalyzed by the FeII/2&#8208;oxoglutarate&#8208;dependent histone demethylase from Class 6 (KDM6). The KDM6 family (KDM6A/KDM6B) catalyzes the demethylation of trimethylated H3K27, which involves iron&#8208;oxo intermediates, including superoxo (FeIII&#8722;OO&#8901;&#8722;), Ferryl (FeIV=O), and hydroxo (FeIII&#8722;OH) complexes. The study determines the role of the second coordination sphere and long&#8208;range interacting residues in KDM6&#8242;s catalysis. More information can be found in the Research Article by C.&#8197;Z.&#8197;Christov and co&#8208;workers. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301305).

         <title>Multi&#8208;Responsive Electropolymer Surface Coatings based on Azo Molecular Switches and Carbazoles: Light, pH and Electrochemical Control of Z &#8594; E Isomerization in Thin Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light&#8208;responsive surfaces are attracting increasing interest, not least because their physicochemical properties can be selectively and temporally controlled by a non&#8208;invasive stimulus. Most existing immobilization strategies involve the chemical attachment of light&#8208;responsive moieties to the surface, although this approach often suffers from a low surface concentration of active species or a high inhomogeneity of applied coatings. Herein we present electropolymerization of carbazoles as a facile and rapid approach for preparing light&#8208;responsive azo&#8208;based surface coatings. The electrochemical oxidative polymerization of bis&#8208;carbazole containing azo&#8209;monomers yields stable films in which the photochemical properties and specific pH sensitivity of azo molecular switches are retained. Moreover, the molecular design enables electrocatalytic control over Z&#160;&#8594;&#160;E azo double bond isomerization facilitated by the conductive polycarbazole backbone. Ultimately, the high degree of control over macromolecular properties yields conductive surface coatings responsive to a range of stimuli, showing great promise as a strategy for versatile application in organic electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Elucidating the Excited State Behavior of Pyridyl Pyridinium Systems via Computational and Transient Absorption studies of Tetrahedral Multichromophoric Arrays and their Model Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The tetrahedral shape&#8208;persistent molecule&#160;14+, containing four identical pyridyl pyridinium units connected&#160;via&#160;a sp3hybridized carbon atom, has been investigated in detail by means of steady&#8208;state and time resolved spectroscopy. Remarkable photophysical properties are observed, particularly in comparison with protonated and methylated analogues (1H48+,&#160;1Me48+), which exhibit a substantially shorter excited state lifetimes and lower emission quantum yields. Theoretical studies have rationalized the behavior of the tetrameric molecules relative to the monomers, with DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations corroborating steady&#8208;state (absorption and emission) and transient absorption spectra. The behavior of the monomeric compounds (each consisting in one of the four identical subunits of the tetramers, i.e.,&#160;2+,&#160;2H2+&#160;and&#160;2Me2+) considerably differs from that of the tetramers, indicating a strong electronic interaction between the subunits in the tetrameric species, likely promoted by the homoconjugation through the connecting sp3&#160;C atom.&#160;2+&#160;is characterized by a peculiar S1&#8208;S2&#160;excited state inversion, whereas the short&#8208;lived emitting S1&#160;state of&#160;2H2+&#160;and&#160;2Me2+&#160;exhibits a partial charge&#8208;transfer character, as substantiated by spectro&#8208;electrochemical studies. Among the six investigated systems, only&#160;14+&#160;is a sizeable luminophore (Fem&#160;= 0.15), which is related to the peculiar features of its singlet state.</dc:description>

         <title>Organoselenium Compounds: Chemistry and Applications in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selenium, a crucial trace element for life, naturally occurs as selenocysteine. Its growing interest over the years is focused not only on the relevant pharmacological properties but also on its use in catalysis. From the point of view of drug developments, selenium&#8208;containing drugs are isosteres of sulfur and oxygen. Different aspects on its appealing chemistry are comprised in this Review article.







Abstract
Selenium, originally described as a toxin, turns out to be a crucial trace element for life that appears as selenocysteine and its dimer, selenocystine. From the point of view of drug developments, selenium&#8208;containing drugs are isosteres of sulfur and oxygen with the advantage that the presence of the selenium atom confers antioxidant properties and high lipophilicity, which would increase cell membrane permeation leading to better oral bioavailability. In this article, we have focused on the relevant features of the selenium atom, above all, the corresponding synthetic approaches to access a variety of organoselenium molecules along with the proposed reaction mechanisms. The preparation and biological properties of selenosugars, including selenoglycosides, selenonucleosides, selenopeptides, and other selenium&#8208;containing compounds will be treated. We have attempted to condense the most important aspects and interesting examples of the chemistry of selenium into a single article.

         <title>The s&#8208;p Nonhybrid Nature Causes Adaptive Superatomic States of Bismuth Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superatoms: The Bin+ clusters are found to be inert with common gases but react with NO, enabling us to screen out Bi7+ and Bi15+ for which we have fully unveiled their relative stability within unique bonding and s&#8208;p nonhybrid nature, indicating potentials of using such building blocks for functional materials.







Abstract
We report a joint experimental and theoretical study on the stability and reactivity of Bin+ (n=5&#8211;33) clusters. The alternating odd&#8208;even effect on the reaction rates of Bin+ clusters with NO is observed, and Bi7+ finds the most inertness. First&#8208;principles calculation results reveal that the lowest energy structures of Bi6&#8208;9+ exhibit quasi&#8208;spherical geometry pertaining to the jellium shell model; however, the Bin+ (n&#8805;10) clusters adopt assembly structures. The prominent stability of Bi7+ is associated with its highly symmetric structure and superatomic states with a magic number of 34e closed shell. For the first time, we demonstrate that the unique s&#8208;p nonhybrid feature in bismuth rationalizes the stability of Bi6&#8208;9+ clusters within the jellium model, by filling the 6s electrons into the superatomic orbitals (forming &#8220;s&#8208;band&#8221;). Interestingly, the stability of 18e &#8220;s&#8208;band&#8221; coincides with the compact structure for Bin+ at n&#8804;9 but assembly structures for n&#8805;10, showing an accommodation of the s electrons to the geometric structure. The atomic p&#8208;orbitals also allow to form superatomic orbitals at higher energy levels, contributing to the preferable structures of tridentate binding units. We illustrate the s&#8208;p nonhybrid nature accommodates the structure and superatomic states of bismuth clusters.

         <title>Cyaphide&#8208;Azide 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition Reactions: Scope and Applicability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of metal cyaphido compounds in 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions with azides to afford metallo&#8208;triazaphospholes is described. The reactions proceed straightforwardly, under mild conditions and in good yields, in a manner reminiscent of the classic alkyne&#8208;azide click reaction. The resulting metallo&#8208;triazaphospholes can be used as precursors to protio&#8208; and iodo&#8208;triazaphospholes.







Abstract
Several examples of the cyaphide&#8208;azide 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reaction to afford metallo&#8208;triazaphospholes are reported. The gold(I) triazaphospholes Au(IDipp)(CPN3R) (IDipp=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene; R=tBu, Ad, Dipp), magnesium(II) triazaphospholes, {Mg(DippNacNac)(CPN3R)}2 (DippNacNac=CH{C(CH3)N(Dipp)}2, Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl; R=tBu, Bn), and germanium(II) triazaphosphole Ge(DippNacNac)&#8208;(CPN3tBu) can be prepared straightforwardly, under mild conditions and in good yields, in a manner reminiscent of the classic alkyne&#8208;azide click reaction (albeit without a catalyst). This reactivity can be extended to compounds with two azide functional groups such as 1,3&#8208;diazidobenzene. It is shown that the resulting metallo&#8208;triazaphospholes can be used as precursors to carbon&#8208;functionalized species, including protio&#8208; and iodo&#8208;triazaphospholes.

         <title>A Versatile Urea Type Linker for Functionalizing Natural Glycans and Its Validation in Glycan Arrays</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel linker for the functionalization of glycosylamines prepared from isolated N&#8208;glycans is described. The protected linked N&#8208;glycans could be easily purified and after deprotection, the primary amine generated serves as &#8220;anchor&#8221; in the preparation of glycan microarrays. The performance of the newly described linker is compared with 3 other linkers after incubation with lectins with known specificity.







Abstract
The isolation from organisms and readily available glycoproteins has become an increasingly convenient source of N&#8208;glycans for multiple applications including glycan microarrays, as reference standards in glycan analysis or as reagents that improve bioavailability of protein and peptide therapeutics through conjugation. A problematic step in the isolation process on a preparative scale can be the attachment of a linker for the improved purification, separation, immobilization and quantification of the glycan structures. Addressing this issue, we firstly aimed for the development of an UV active linker for a fast and reliable attachment to anomeric glycosylamines via urea bond formation. Secondly, we validated the new linker on glycan arrays in a comparative study with a collection of N&#8208;glycans which were screened against various lectins. In total, we coupled four structurally varied N&#8208;glycans to four different linkers, immobilized all constructs on a microarray and compared their binding affinities to four plant and fungal lectins of widely described specificity. Our study shows that the urea type linker showed an overall superior performance for lectin binding and once more, highlights the often neglected influence of the choice of linker on lectin recognition.

By utilizing a chiral oligoEG and potassium fluoride as a cation&#8208;binding catalyst and base, respectively, a wide range of biologically relevant chiral 2&#8208;nitroallylic amines are obtained with excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8201;ee) through the organocatalytic asymmetric aza&#8208;Henry&#8208;like reaction of &#946;&#8208;monosubstituted and &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted nitroalkenes with &#945;&#8208;amidosulfones as imine precursors. Preliminary use of a chiral 2&#8208;nitroallylic amine as a Michael acceptor demonstrated its potential application for diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of bioactive compounds.

Abstract
A set of ruthenium(II)&#8208;protic&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complexes, [Ru(NNCH)(PPh3)2(X)]Cl (1, X=Cl and 2, X=H) and their deprotonated forms [Ru(NNC)(PPh3)2(X)] (1&#8217;, X=Cl and 2&#8217;, X=H), in which NNC is a new unsymmetrical pincer ligand, are reported. The four complexes are interconvertible by simple acid&#8208;base chemistry. The combined theoretical and spectroscopic investigations indicate charge segregation in anionic&#8208;NHC complexes (1&#8217; and 2&#8217;) and can be described from a Lewis pair perspective. The chemical reactivity of deprotonated complex 1&#8217; shows cooperative small molecule activation. Complex 1&#8217; activates H&#8722;H bond of hydrogen, C(sp3)&#8208;I bond of iodomethane, and C(sp)&#8208;H bond of phenylacetylene. The activation of CO2 using anionic NHC complex 1&#8217; at moderate temperature and ambient pressure and subsequent conversion to formate is also described. All the new compounds have been characterized using ESI&#8208;MS, 1H, 13C, and 31P&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. Molecular structures of 1, 2, and 2&#8217; have also been determined with single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The cooperative small molecule activation perspective broadens the scope of potential applications of anionic&#8208;NHC complexes in small molecule activation, including the conversion of carbon dioxide to formate, a much sought after reaction in the renewable energy and sustainable development domains.

         <title>Exploring the potential of anthraquinone&#8208;based hybrids for&#160; identifying a novel generation of antagonists for the Smoothened receptor in HH&#8208;dependent tumour</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural products (NPs) are highly profitable pharmacological tools due to their chemical diversity and ability to modulate biological systems. Accessing new chemical entities while retaining the biological relevance of natural chemotypes is a fundamental goal in the design of novel bioactive compounds. Notably, NPs have played a crucial role in understanding Hedgehog (HH) signalling and its pharmacological modulation in anticancer therapy. However, HH antagonists developed so far have shown several limitations, thus growing the interest in the design of second&#8208;generation HH inhibitors. Through smart manipulation of the NPs core&#8208;scaffold, unprecedented and intriguing architectures have been achieved following different design strategies. Here, we report the rational design and synthesis of a first and second generation of anthraquinone&#8208;based hybrids by combining the rhein scaffold with variously substituted piperazine nuclei that are structurally similar to the active portion of known SMO antagonists, the main transducer of the HH pathway.&#160;A thorough functional and biological investigation identified RH2_2 and RH2_6 rhein&#8208;based hybrids as valuable candidates for HH inhibition through SMO antagonism, with the consequent suppression of HH&#8208;dependent tumour growth. Our findings also corroborated the successful application of the NPs&#8208;based hybrid design strategy in the development of novel NP&#8208;based SMO antagonists.</dc:description>

         <title>Cryogenic Ion Fluorescence Spectroscopy: FRET in Rhodamine Homodimers and Heterodimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The internal electronic communication between two or more light&#8208;absorbers is fundamental for energy&#8208;transport processes, a field of large current interest. Here we have studied the intrinsic photophysics of homo&#8208; and heterodimers of rhodamine cations where just two methylene units bridge the dyes. Gas&#8208;phase experiments were done on frozen molecular ions at cryogenic temperatures using the newly built LUNA2 mass spectroscopy setup in Aarhus. Both absorption (from fluorescence excitation) and dispersed&#8208;fluorescence spectra were measured. In the gas phase, there is no dielectric screening from solvent molecules, and the effect of charges on transition energies is maximum. Indeed, bands are redshifted compared to those of monomer dyes due to the electric field that each dye senses from the other in a dimer. Importantly, also, as two chemically identical dyes in a homodimer do not experience the same field along the long axis, each dye has separate absorption. At low temperatures, it is therefore possible to selectively excite one dye. We find that fluorescence is dominantly from the dye with the lowest transition energy no matter which dye is photoexcited. Hence our work unequivocally demonstrates F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer even in homodimers where one dye acts as donor and the other as acceptor.</dc:description>

         <title>A DFT Study of Imine Exchange Reactions in Iron(II)&#8208;Coordinated Pincers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The imine bond is among the most applied motifs in dynamic covalent chemistry. Although its uses are varied and often involve coordination to a transition metal for stability, mechanistic studies on imine exchange reactions so far have not included metal coordination. Herein, we investigated the condensation and transimination reactions of an Fe2+&#8208;coordinated diimine pyridine pincer, employing wB97XD/6&#8208;311G(2d,2p) DFT calculations in acetonitrile. We first experimentally confirmed that Fe2+ is strongly coordinated by these pincers, and is thus a justified model ion. When considering a four&#8208;membered ring&#8208;shaped transition state for proton transfers, the required activation energies for condensation and transimination reaction exceeded values expected for reactions known to be spontaneous at room temperature. The nature of the incoming and exiting amines and the substituents on the para&#8208;position of the pincer had no effect on this. Replacing Fe2+ with Zn2+ or removing it altogether did not reduce it either. However, addition of two ethylamine molecules lowered the energy barriers to be compatible with experiment (19.4 and 23.2 kcal/mol for condensation and transimination, respectively). Lastly, the energy barrier of condensation of a non&#8208;coordinated pincer was significantly higher than found for Fe2+&#8208;coordinating pincers, underlined the catalyzing effect of metal coordination on imine exchange reactions.</dc:description>

We report herein the first examples of 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetraaryl&#8208;5&#8208;azaporphyrinium (MTAMAP) salts, which were prepared via metal&#8208;templated cyclization of the corresponding zinc(II) and copper(II) complexes of 10&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;chloro&#8208;19&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;5,15&#8208;dimesityl&#8208;10&#8208;azabiladiene&#8208;ac. The inclusion of one meso&#8208;nitrogen atom in the 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetraarylporphyrin skeleton considerably changes the redox and optical properties as well as the degree of aromaticity of the porphyrin ring. The present findings suggest that MTAMAP salts would be promising scaffolds for the development of new azaporphyrin&#8208;based ionic fluorophores and photosensitizers.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Carbon&#8208;Sulfur Bond Formation between Aryl Iodides and Aromatic Sulfur Surrogates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of aromatic thioethers from C&#8208;S coupling is of great importance in synthetic chemistry. Traditional solution strategies through transition&#8208;metal catalysis generally require bulk solution, heat, and longer reaction time. Herein, a mechano&#8208;promoted sulfenylation of aryl iodides with nickel catalysis is described.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The formation of aromatic thioethers from C-S coupling is of great importance in synthetic chemistry. Traditional solution strategies through transition-metal catalysis generally require bulk solution, heat, and longer reaction time. Herein, a mechano-promoted sulfenylation of aryl iodides with nickel catalysis is described. The active aromatic sulfide agents are in-situ generated from aromatic thiol or disulfide and subsequently adapted in the nickel catalytic cycle, with a tolerance of broad substituted groups under optimized conditions. In addition to the gram-scale synthesis that reveals the application potential of the method, the radical trap-ping and competitive experiments are also conducted for the mechanistic study, thus proposing the plausible mechanism rationally. Furthermore, the proposed methodology is certificated as being versatile and following the green principles with ideal calculated values of green chemistry matrix and the comparison with other approaches for C-S bond formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Double&#8208;Walled Covalent Organic Frameworks with High Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Double&#8208;walled covalent organic frameworks, consisting of two same building blocks parallel to each other forming ladder&#8208;shape linkers, could enhance the stability of the frameworks and increase the density of functional sites, thus making them suitable for various applications. In this study, two double&#8208;walled covalent organic frameworks, namely DW&#8208;COF&#8208;1 and DW&#8208;COF&#8208;2, were successfully synthesized via imine condensation. The resulting DW&#8208;COFs exhibited a honeycomb topology, high crystallinity and stability. Particularly, DW&#8208;COF&#8208;2 showed excellent resistance toward boiling water, strong acid, and strong base, due to its double&#8208;wall structure, which limits the exposure of labile imine bonds to external chemical environments. The DW&#8208;COFs showed high porosity near 900 m2/g, making them suitable for gas storage/separation. The selective gas adsorption experiments showed that at 273 K and 1 atm pressure, DW&#8208;COF&#8208;1 and DW&#8208;COF&#8208;2 exhibited a good IAST selectivity towards CO2/N2 (15/85) adsorption, with selectivity values of 121.3 and 56.4 for CO2 over N2, respectively.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The deposition of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) films with defined exposed facets is important to enhance the performance of these films for e.g. catalysis or separations. In this work, MOF films with specific exposed facets are electrodeposited anodically on various substrates (e.g. on copper&#8208;sputtered Si wafers, copper meshes, copper foams, and polypropylene membranes). The influence of the deposition parameters, including the pH of the solution, current density, concentration of linker, and solvent, on the exposed facets of the deposited MOFs was investigated. The results suggest that precise control over the supersaturation during anodic deposition is a possible strategy for synthesizing MOF crystals with well&#8208;defined exposed facets. This approach provides a powerful toolbox for various applications requiring crystal facet control of MOF films.</dc:description>

         <title>Neutral and Cationic Molybdenum Imido Alkylidene Cyclic Alkyl Amino Carbene (CAAC) Complexes for Olefin Metathesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first neutral and cationic molybdenum imido alkylidene cyclic alkyl amino carbene (CAAC) complexes are reported. Different ligand combinations together with selected single crystal X&#8208;ray structures provide a comprehensive understanding of their structural peculiarities. The new complexes outperform their NHC counterparts in the olefin metathesis of hydrocarbon&#8208;based olefins.







Abstract
The first neutral and cationic Mo imido alkylidene cyclic alkyl amino carbene (CAAC) complexes of the general formulae [Mo(N&#8722;Ar)(CHCMe2Ph)(X)2(CAAC)] and [Mo(N&#8722;Ar)(CHCMe2Ph)(X)(CAAC)][B(ArF)4] (X=Br, Cl, OTf, OC6F5; CAAC=1&#8208;(2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3)&#8208;3,3,5,5&#8208;tetramethyltetrahydropyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) have been synthesized from molybdenum imido bishalide alkylidene DME precursors. Different combinations of the imido and &#8220;X&#8221; ligands have been employed to understand synthetic peculiarities. Selected complexes have been characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Due to the pronounced &#963;&#8208;donor/&#960;&#8208;acceptor characteristics of CAACs, the corresponding neutral and cationic molybdenum imido alkylidene CAAC complexes do not require the presence of stabilizing donor ligands such as nitriles. Calculations on the PBE0&#8208;D3BJ/def2&#8208;TZVP level for PBE0&#8208;D3BJ/def2&#8208;SVP optimized geometries revealed partial charges at molybdenum similar to the corresponding molybdenum imido alkylidene N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes with a slightly higher polarization of the molybdenum alkylidene bond in the CAAC complexes. All cationic complexes have been tested in olefin metathesis reactions and showed improved activity compared to the analogous NHC complexes for hydrocarbon&#8208;based substrates, allowing for turnover numbers (TONs) up to 9500 even at room temperature. Some Mo imido alkylidene CAAC complexes are tolerant towards functional groups like thioethers and sulfonamides.

         <title>NAD(P)H:Quinone Acceptor Oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) Activatable Salicylamide H+/Cl&#8722; Transporters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we report two enzyme activatable ion transport systems that, on selective activation by NQO1&#8208; an enzyme abundant in cancer cells, are capable of transporting H+/Cl&#8722; across the lipid bilayer. This transport disrupts the ion homeostasis specifically in the cancer cells and triggers apoptosis via mitochondrial membrane depolarization, lysosomal deacidification, and oxidative stress induction.







Abstract
NAD(P)H:quinone acceptor oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), a detoxifying enzyme overexpressed in tumors, plays a key role in protecting cancer cells against oxidative stress and thus has been considered an attractive candidate for activating prodrug(s). Herein, we report the first use of NQO1 for the selective activation of &#8216;protransporter&#8217; systems in cancer cells leading to the induction of apoptosis. Salicylamides, easily synthesizable small molecules, have been effectively used for efficient H+/Cl&#8722; symport across lipid membranes. The ion transport activity of salicylamides was efficiently abated by caging the OH group with NQO1 activatable quinones via either ether or ester linkage. The release of active transporters, following the reduction of quinone caged &#8216;protransporters&#8217; by NQO1, was verified. Both the transporters and protransporters exhibited significant toxicity towards the MCF&#8208;7 breast cancer line, mediated via the induction of oxidative stress, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and lysosomal deacidification. Induction of cell death via intrinsic apoptotic pathway was verified by monitoring PARP1 cleavage.

         <title>Naphthalimide&#8208;Dyes Bearing Phosphine and Phosphorylamide Moieties: Synthesis and Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New 1,8&#8208;naphthalimides bearing phosphine and amine chelating moieties has been prepared and their optical properties both as single molecules and when complexed on Pd(II) ions have been investigated. The complexation with Pd(II) quenches the fluorescence emission of the dye but activates an unexpected reactivity leading to a novel strongly emissive 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide dye bearing a cyclic phosphorylamide moiety.







Abstract
1,8&#8208;Naphthalimides (NIs) represent a class of organic dyes with interesting optical properties that has been extensively explored in the last decades in lighting devices, chemosensors, optical probes or medicinal chemistry. However, despite their remarkable potential, reports on organometallic dyes bearing NIs are scarce and virtually inexistent regarding palladium(II) complexes. Herein, we report the synthesis of NIs bearing phosphine and amine chelating moieties and the characterization of their optical properties both as single molecules and when complexed on Pd(II) ions. It is shown that the introduction of phosphine moieties in the naphthalimide core results in a marked increase in non&#8208;radiative processes, leading to a significant reduction of the emission efficiency and lifetime of these dyes, compared to amine&#8208;bearing counterparts. The complexation to Pd(II) sequesters the electronic contribution of chelating moieties, with complexes assuming an optical behavior similar to that of unsubstituted 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide. The complexation significantly increases the acidity of chelating secondary amines, giving rise to an unexpected intramolecular reaction that results in the formation of a novel 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide dye bearing a cyclic phosphorylamide moiety. The new dye exhibits good emission quantum yield, long fluorescence lifetime and sensitivity to basic media, evidencing potential for application in optical imaging and sensing scenarios.

It is shown that the introduction of phosphine moieties in the naphthalimide core results in a marked increase in non-radiative processes, leading to a significant reduction of the emission efficiency and lifetime of these dyes, compared to amine-bearing counterparts. The complexation to Pd(II) sequesters the electronic contribution of chelating moieties, with complexes assuming an optical behavior similar to that of unsubstituted 1,8-naphthalimide. The complexation significantly increases the acidity of chelating secondary amines, giving rise to an unexpected intramolecular reaction that results in the formation of a novel 1,8-naphthalimide dye bearing a cyclic phosphorylamide moiety. The new dye exhibits good emission quantum yield, long fluorescence lifetime and sensitivity to basic media, evidencing potential for application in optical imaging and sensing scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Caged Luciferase Inhibitor&#8208;Based Bioluminescence Switching Strategy Enables Efficient Detection of Serum APN Activity and the Identification of Its Roles in Metastasis of Non&#8208;Small Cell Lung Cancer
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A caged luciferase inhibitor&#8208;based bioluminescence&#8208;switching strategy (CLIBS) is developed and used to determine circulating Aminopeptidase N (APN) activity in the complicated bio&#8208;samples with robust efficacy. By applying the CLIBS to serum samples in non&#8211;small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, it is revealed that circulating APN activity serves as an independent factor for forecasting NSCLC patients&#8217; risk of metastasis.







Abstract
Bioluminogenic probes emerged as powerful tools for imaging and analysis of various bioanalyses, but traditional approaches would be limited to the low sensitivity during determine the low activity of protease in clinical specimens. Herein, we proposed a caged luciferase inhibitor&#8208;based bioluminescence&#8208;switching strategy (CLIBS) by using a cleavable luciferase inhibitor to modulate the activity of luciferase reporter to amplify the detective signals, which led to the enhancement of detection sensitivity, and enabled the determination of circulating Aminopeptidase N (APN) activity in thousands of times diluted serum. By applying the CLIBS to serum samples in non&#8211;small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients from two clinical cohorts, we revealed that, for the first time, higher circulating APN activities but not its concentration, were associated with more NSCLC metastasis or higher metastasis stages by subsequent clinical analysis, and can serve as an independent factor for forecasting NSCLC patients&#8217; risk of metastasis.

The investigated indolin&#8208;3&#8208;one derivative exhibits fast photoisomerization in apolar solvents. In melanoma cells, the compound showed lipid droplet accumulation along with photoactivated toxicity.







Abstract
The study of a fluorescent indolin&#8208;3&#8208;one derivative is reported that, as opposed to its previously described congeners, selectively undergoes photoactivated ring&#8208;opening in apolar solvents. The excited state involved in this photoisomerization was partially deactivated by the formation of singlet oxygen. Cell studies revealed lipid droplet accumulation and efficient light&#8208;induced cytotoxicity.

2&#8208;(Pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)imidazo[1,5&#8208;b]pyridazine&#8208;7&#8208;ylidene was introduced as a dimetal&#8208;binding rigid scaffold. The scaffold was first converted into an Au,N,N&#8208;tridentate ligand through binding of Au(I)Cl at the carbene site. By using the Au,N,N&#8208;tridentate ligand, various trinuclear heterobimetallic complexes with intermetallic interactions were readily preparable with 3d&#8208;transition metals (CuI, CuII, NiII, and CoII). The structures of these complexes were unambiguously determined by SC&#8208;XRD analysis.







Abstract
As a dimetal&#8208;binding rigid scaffold, 2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)imidazo[1,5&#8208;b]pyridazine&#8208;7&#8208;ylidene was introduced. The scaffold was first converted into a meridional Au,N,N&#8208;tridentate ligand through binding of a Au(I)Cl moiety at the carbene center. The Au(I) center and the N,N&#8208;chelating moiety were expected to function as metallophilic and 4e&#8208;&#963;&#8208;donative interaction sites, respectively, in the binding of the second metal center. In this manner, various trinuclear heterobimetallic complexes were synthesized with different 3d&#8208;metal sources, such as cationic CuI, CuII, NiII, and CoII salts. SC&#8208;XRD analysis showed that the mono&#8208;3d&#8208;metal di&#8208;gold(I) trinuclear heterobimetallic complexes were constructed through gold(I)&#8208;metal interactions. Metallophilic interactions were also investigated by quantum chemical calculations including the AIM and IGMH methods.

         <title>Iso&#8208;Pentadienyl Carbonate as a Five Carbon Synthon in Manganese(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Linear 1,3&#8208;Dienylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A manganese(I)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H dienylation of arenes using iso&#8208;pentadienyl carbonate as five carbon synthons is reported. This is a highly unprecedented report for selective linear 1,3&#8208;dienylation by using C&#8722;H activation catalysis. Our method facilitates the synthesis of varieties of dienes, including those suitable for normal or inverse electron demand Diels&#8208;Alder reactions, dienyl glycoconjugates, and unnatural amino acids. Moreover, the synthetic applicability of this method eased to deliver a 6/6/5&#8208;fused tricyclic nagilactone scaffold.







Abstract
Selective linear 1,3&#8208;dienylations are essential transformations, and numerous synthetic efforts have been documented. However, a general method enabling access to electron&#8208;rich, &#8208;poor, and biologically relevant dienyl molecules is in high demand. Hence, we report a straightforward method of manganese(I)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H dienylation of arenes by using iso&#8208;pentadienyl carbonate as a five carbon synthon. This is a highly unprecedented report for selective linear 1,3&#8208;dienylation using manganese C&#8722;H activation catalysis. Our method facilitates the synthesis of varieties of dienes, including those suitable for normal or inverse electron demand Diels&#8208;Alder reactions, dienyl glycoconjugates, and unnatural amino acids. Extensive mechanistic studies, including isolation of C&#8722;H activated organo&#8208;manganese complex and isotopic analyses, have supported the proposed mechanism of this dienylation.

         <title>Thermally&#8208;Activated Geometrical Regioselective E &#8594; Z Isomerization&#8208;Enabled Cascade Sequences of Conjugated Dienals: Experimental and DFT Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The geometrical regioselective E &#8594; Z isomerization of a conjugated alkene under thermal activation poses a challenge due to microscopic reversibility. Herein we report that such reversibility issues can be circumvented by integrating E &#8594; Z isomerization with subsequent cyclization cascade.&#160;Thus, linearly conjugated dienals in a mixture of toluene&#8210;alcohol (2:1) solvents or only with alcohol at 60&#8208;70 &#176;C can be converted to &#947;&#8208;alkoxybutenolides in moderate to good yields. The intermediary 2Z,4E&#8210;isomer can be isolated, which includes the first example of isolating the regioselective isomerization product under thermal conditions.&#160; Density functional theory (DFT) studies have been employed to shed light on the feasibility of geometrical alkene isomerization and ensuing cascade sequences. It has been observed that the regioselective 2E,4E &#8594; 2Z,4E isomerization of dienal is a thermodynamically facile (&#916;G &lt; 0) process. The thermodynamic plausibility of the subsequent cascade reaction from the Z&#8208;isomer to the anticipated product in the presence of a polar protic solvent (here MeOH) is also explicated.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The geometrical regioselective E &#8594; Z isomerization of a conjugated alkene under thermal activation poses a challenge due to microscopic reversibility. Herein we report that such reversibility issues can be circumvented by integrating E &#8594; Z isomerization with subsequent cyclization cascade.&#160;Thus, linearly conjugated dienals in a mixture of toluene&#8210;alcohol (2:1) solvents or only with alcohol at 60-70 &#176;C can be converted to &#947;-alkoxybutenolides in moderate to good yields. The intermediary 2Z,4E&#8210;isomer can be isolated, which includes the first example of isolating the regioselective isomerization product under thermal conditions.&#160; Density functional theory (DFT) studies have been employed to shed light on the feasibility of geometrical alkene isomerization and ensuing cascade sequences. It has been observed that the regioselective 2E,4E &#8594; 2Z,4E isomerization of dienal is a thermodynamically facile (&#916;G &amp;lt; 0) process. The thermodynamic plausibility of the subsequent cascade reaction from the Z-isomer to the anticipated product in the presence of a polar protic solvent (here MeOH) is also explicated. Out of the two probable pathways, the "hemiacetal pathway" involving a relay proton transfer is kinetically more feasible due to the diminished activation barrier than the conjugate addition pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly enantioselective synthesis of pharmaceuticals at chiral&#8208;encoded metal surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantioselective catalysis is of crucial importance in modern chemistry and pharmaceutical science. To obtain high purity chiral compounds, although various concepts have been used for the development of enantioselective catalysts, most of them are based on homogeneous catalytic systems. Recently, we have successfully developed nanostructured metal layers imprinted with chiral information, which have been applied as electrocatalysts for the enantioselective synthesis of chiral model compounds. However, so far such materials have not been employed as heterogeneous catalysts for the enantioselective synthesis of real pharmaceutical products. In this contribution, we report the asymmetric synthesis of chiral pharmaceuticals (CPs) with chiral imprinted Pt&#8208;Ir surfaces as a simple hydrogenation catalyst. By fine&#8208;tuning the experimental parameters, a very high enantioselectivity (up to 95% enantiomeric excess, ee) with good catalyst stability can be achieved. The designed materials have also been successfully used as catalytically active stationary phases for the continuous asymmetric flow synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds. This illustrates the possibility of producing for the first time real chiral pharmaceuticals at such nanostructured metal surfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Application of Machine Learning Algorithms to Metadynamics for the Elucidation of the Binding Modes and Free Energy Landscape of Drug/Target Interactions: a Case Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the context of drug discovery, computational methods were able to accelerate the challenging process of designing and optimizing a new drug candidate. Amongst the possible atomistic simulation approaches, metadynamics (metaD) has proven very powerful. However, the choice of collective variables (CVs) is not trivial for complex systems. To automate the process of CVs identification, we apply here two different machine learning (ML) algorithms, namely DeepLDA and Autoencoder, to the metaD simulation of a well&#8208;researched drug/target complex, constituted by a pharmacologically relevant non&#8208;canonical DNA secondary structure (G&#8208;quadruplex) and a metallodrug acting as its stabilizer, as well as solvent molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and VCD Spectroscopic Characterization of a Series of Azacryptands from a Chiral Valine&#8208;based Derivative of Tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)amine (TREN)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilizing experimental and computational vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectroscopy, we explored the conformational preferences of a series of chiral C3&#8208;symmetric octaazacryptands with tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)&#8208;amine head groups derived from valine. While the spectra of the smallest azacryptand with p&#8208;phenyl linkers and its elongated derivative with p&#8208;biphenyls linker were found to match well with the computed spectra, the computed conformational preferences of the m&#8208;biphenyl&#8208;based azacryptand did not seem to reflect the conformations dominating in chloroform solution. A detailed analysis revealed that structural changes resulting in a collapsed cage structure gave a notably better match with the experiment. It could subsequently be concluded from the VCD analysis, that the octaazacryptands prefer a collapsed structure, which is not predicted by density functional theory (DFT) calculations as the global minimum structures. These findings are expected to have consequences also for future studies on inclusion complexes of such azacryptands.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox Activity of IrIII Complexes with Multidentate Ligands Based on Dipyrido&#8208;annulated N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes: Access to High Valent and High Spin State with Carbon Donors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic strategies to access high&#8208;valent iridium complexes usually require&#160;use of &#960; donating ligands bearing electronegative atoms (e.g. amide or oxide) or &#963; donating electropositive atoms (e.g. boryl or hydride). Besides the &#951;5&#8208;(methyl)cyclopentadienyl derivatives, high&#8208;valent &#951;1 carbon&#8208;ligated iridium complexes are challenging to synthesize. To meet this challenge, this work reports the oxidation behavior of an all&#8208;carbon&#8208;ligated anionic bis(CCC&#8208;pincer) IrIII complex. Being both &#963; and &#960; donating, the diaryl dipyrido&#8208;annulated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (dpa&#8208;NHC) IrIII complex allowed a stepwise 4e&#8211; oxidation sequence. The first 2e&#8211; oxidation led to an oxidative coupling of two adjacent aryl groups, resulting in formation of a cationic chiral IrIII complex bearing a CCCC&#8208;tetradentate ligand. A further 2e&#8211; oxidation allowed isolation of a high&#8208;valent tricationic complex with a triplet ground state. These results close a synthetic gap for carbon&#8208;ligated iridium complexes and demonstrate the electronic tuning potential&#160;of organic &#960; ligands for unusual electronic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Spin Orbit Charge Transfer Intersystem Crossing and Slow Intramolecular Triplet&#8208;Triplet Energy Transfer in Bodipy&#8208;Perylenebisimide Compact Dyads and Triads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We prepared Bodipy (BDP)&#8208;perylenebisimide (PBI) donor&#8208;acceptor dyads/triad to study the spin orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC). For BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;3, in which BDP was attached at the imide position of PBI, higher singlet oxygen quantum yield (FD = 85%) was observed than the bay&#8208;substituted derivative BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;1 (FD = 30%). Femtosecond transient absorption spectra indicate slow F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET; 40.4 ps) and charge separation (CS; 1.55 ns) in BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;3, while for BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;1, CS takes 2.8 ps. For triad BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;2, ultrafast FRET (149 fs) and CS (4.7 ps) process were observed, the subsequent charge recombination (CR) takes 5.8 ns and long lived 3PBI* (179.8 &#181;s) state is populated. Nanosecond transient absorption spectra of BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;3 show that the CR gives upper triplet excited state (3BDP*) and subsequently, via a slow intramolecular triplet energy transfer (14.5 &#181;s), the 3PBI* state is finally populated, indicating that upper triplet state is involved in SOCT&#8208;ISC. Time resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed that both radical pair ISC (RP ISC) and SOCT&#8208;ISC contribute to the ISC. A rare electron spin polarization of (e, e, e, e, e, e) was observed for the triplet state formed via the RP ISC mechanism, due to the S&#8208;T+1/T0 states mixing.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Since the discovery of urea inclusion compounds (UICs) in 1940, the handedness of this chiral helical system has not been established experimentally. By studying three UIC systems containing light&#8208;atoms only, the optical rotations were first measured, and the absolute structures of the enantiomorphic domains of three UICs were determined via single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD). The correlation between the optical rotation and the absolute configuration of the UICs was finally established, showcasing the power of absolute structure determination via SCXRD, which is essential in structural chemistry and pharmaceutical research.</dc:description>

The correlation between the optical rotation and the absolute configuration of the UICs was finally established, showcasing the power of absolute structure determination via SCXRD, which is essential in structural chemistry and pharmaceutical research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aminoacid&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of Hollow Hierarchical FER Zeolite with Improved Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hierarchical zeolites are highly&#8208;desired catalysts in the petrochemical industry due to their shorter diffusion length, faster diffusion rate, and better accessibility to active acid sites compared with conventional zeolites. Herein, we report a simple aminoacid&#8208;assisted method to synthesize urchin&#8208;like hollow hierarchical FER zeolite with abundant mesopores and macroporous inner cavities. An aminoacid (i.e. L&#8208;lysine) is used to facilitate the agglomeration of primary nanoparticles, and the agglomerates with staged crystallization in the internal and surface. The preferential nucleation and crystal growth at the external surfaces together with the lagged crystallization of the inner core of the agglomerates results in the formation of hollow inner cavities after the exhaustion of interior materials. Thanks to the unique hierarchical structure and more accessible acid sites, the hollow hierarchical FER zeolite exhibits improved catalytic performance over the conventional one in the skeletal isomerization of 1&#8208;butene to isobutene.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilizing Nitroxide Spin Labels for Structural and Conformational Studies of Biomolecules by Maleimide Treatment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stabilizing NO radical: The instability of NO radicals in cell lysates and cells limits its application in characterizing biomolecular activity by EPR. Maleimide is shown as an effective reagent of stabilizing the NO radicals in cell lysates by preserving the intracellular confinement, enables high fidelity of EPR measurement of NO spin labelled biomolecules in maleimide treated cell lysates.







Abstract
Nitroxide (NO) spin radicals are effective in characterizing structures, interactions and dynamics of biomolecules. The EPR applications in cell lysates or intracellular milieu require stable spin labels, but NO radicals are unstable in such conditions. We showed that the destabilization of NO radicals in cell lysates or even in cells is caused by NADPH/NADH related enzymes, but not by the commonly believed reducing reagents such as GSH. Maleimide stabilizes the NO radicals in the cell lysates by consumption of the NADPH/NADH that are essential for the enzymes involved in destabilizing NO radicals, instead of serving as the solo thiol scavenger. The maleimide treatment retains the crowding properties of the intracellular components and allows to perform long&#8208;time EPR measurements of NO labeled biomolecules close to the intracellular conditions. The strategy of maleimide treatment on cell lysates for the EPR applications has been demonstrated on double electron&#8208;electron resonance (DEER) measurements on a number of NO labeled protein samples. The method opens a broad application range for the NO labeled biomolecules by EPR in conditions that resemble the intracellular milieu.

         <title>Recent Advances in Aerobic Oxidative of C&#8722;H Bond by Molecular Oxygen Focus on Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise summary of recent advances on green oxidative coupling reactions of C&#8722;H bond focus on heterocyclic compounds for construction of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;X (X=N, O, S, or P) bonds using O2 as internal oxidant since 2010 was given. The transformations described here aim to provide a platform for expanding the scope and utility of O2 as green oxidation, together with a brief discussion on research into the mechanisms behind it, hoping to reveal some common reaction patterns and development trends, as well as potential applications and challenges in the near future.







Abstract
Aerobic oxidative cross&#8208;coupling represents one of the most straightforward and atom&#8208;economic methods for construction of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;X (X=N, O, S, or P) bonds using air as a sustainable external oxidant. The oxidative coupling of C&#8722;H bonds in heterocyclic compounds can effectively increase their molecular complexity by introducing new functional groups through C&#8722;H bond activation, or by formation of new heterocyclic structures through cascade construction of two or more sequential chemical bonds. This is very useful as it can increase the potential applications of these structures in natural products, pharmaceuticals, agricultural chemicals, and functional materials. This is a representative overview of recent progress since 2010 on green oxidative coupling reactions of C&#8722;H bond using O2 or air as internal oxidant focus on Heterocycles. It aims to provide a platform for expanding the scope and utility of air as green oxidant, together with a brief discussion on research into the mechanisms behind it.

Six Metal Interactions: This is the first isolated tellurium and mercury containing metallaazamacrocycle which exhibits unsymmetrical figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight conformation. It hosts two silver ions in the skeleton and displays intramolecular Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag, Ag&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te, Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te as well as intermolecular Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Hg interactions. The intermolecular Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Hg mercurophilic interactions connect six atoms as Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te in non&#8208;linear fashion.







Abstract
Herein, a new tellurium and mercury containing mercuraazametallamacrocycle has been prepared via (2+2) condensation of bis(o&#8208;aminophenyl)telluride and bis(o&#8208;formylphenyl)mercury(II). The isolated bright yellow solid of mercuraazametallamacrocycle has adopted unsymmetrical figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight conformation in the crystal structure. To study the metallophilic interactions between closed shell metal ions, the macrocyclic ligand has been treated with two equiv. of AgOTf (OTf=trifluoromethansulfonate) and AgBF4, which afforded greenish&#8208;yellow bimetallic silver complexes. The isolated silver complexes displayed intramolecular Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag, Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag interactions as well as intermolecular Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Hg interactions and formed an extended 1D molecular chain by directing six atoms to interact as TeII&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;AgI&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;HgII&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;HgII&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;AgI&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;TeII in a non linear fashion. The Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag, Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag interactions have also been studied in solution by 199Hg, 125Te&#8197;NMR spectroscopy, absorption, and emission spectroscopy. In DFT calculations, the Atom in Molecule (AIM) analysis, non&#8208;covalent interactions (NCI), natural bonding orbital (NBO) analysis strongly supported for experimental evidences and revealed that the intermolecular Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Hg interaction is stronger than the intramolecular Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag interactions.

         <title>Borylated Subphthalocyanines: Versatile Precursors for the Preparation of Functional Bowl&#8208;Shaped Aromatics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis, electronic properties, and reactivity of borylated subphthalocyanines (SubPcs) are reported. These compounds display a great stability and serve as powerful starting materials for the post&#8208;functionalization of SubPcs via cross&#8208;coupling reactions.







Abstract
The peripheral borylation of porphyrinoids has become a key step to prepare advanced functional materials. This study reports the synthesis, electronic properties, and reactivity of borylated subphthalocyanines. These compounds, which are prepared by Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura borylation in excellent yields, are easily purified, display a great stability, and serve as powerful starting materials for the post&#8208;functionalization of SubPcs via cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Remarkably, this novel approach is more efficient than the methodologies already described and enables the preparation of exotic systems, such as SubPc dimeric species linked by C&#8722;C bonds, which are not accessible so far and present promising properties for optoelectronic devices.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Synthesis, electronic properties, and reactivity&lt;/b&gt; of borylated subphthalocyanines (SubPcs) are reported. These compounds display a great stability and serve as powerful starting materials for the post-functionalization of SubPcs via cross-coupling reactions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peripheral borylation of porphyrinoids has become a key step to prepare advanced functional materials. This study reports the synthesis, electronic properties, and reactivity of borylated subphthalocyanines. These compounds, which are prepared by Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura borylation in excellent yields, are easily purified, display a great stability, and serve as powerful starting materials for the post-functionalization of SubPcs via cross-coupling reactions. Remarkably, this novel approach is more efficient than the methodologies already described and enables the preparation of exotic systems, such as SubPc dimeric species linked by C&#8722;C bonds, which are not accessible so far and present promising properties for optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unexcited Light Source Imaging for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unexcited light imaging has gained much attention in recent years because of its high sensitivity and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. This article provides an overview of the application of chemiluminescence, bioluminescence and afterglow luminescence in biomedical imaging. The imaging mechanisms and luminescence enhancement strategies are also briefly described.







Abstract
Optical imaging has a wide range of applications in the biomedical field, allowing the visualization of physiological processes and helping in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Unexcited light source imaging technologies, such as chemiluminescence imaging, bioluminescence imaging and afterglow imaging have attracted great attention in recent years because of the absence of excitation light interference in their application and the advantages of high sensitivity and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. In this review, the latest advances in unexcited light source imaging technology for biomedical applications are highlighted. The design strategies of unexcited light source luminescent probes in improving luminescence brightness, penetration depth, quantum yield and targeting, and their applications in inflammation imaging, tumor imaging, liver and kidney injury imaging and bacterial infection imaging are introduced in detail. The research progress and future prospects of unexcited light source imaging for medical applications are further discussed.

&#8220;The interplay between the exceptional &#960;&#8208;acceptor and &#963;&#8208;donor properties of the pyridyl&#8208;mesoionic carbene is fascinating for the design of new potential photo&#8208; and electrocatalysts.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202301205).







Abstract

         <title>Experimental and Computational Studies on RuII&#8208;Catalyzed C7&#8208;Allylation of Indolines with Allyl Bromide</title>

Allyation: The selective C7&#8208;allylation of indolines with allyl bromide under ruthenium catalysis has been reported. Experimental and DFT study has been carried out to probe the mechanism of the reaction.







Abstract
The selective C7&#8208;allylation of indolines with allyl bromide under ruthenium catalysis has been revealed here. Under established reaction conditions, C7&#8208;allylation of various indolines, including drug compounds, was accomplished with good selectivity and yields. Based on combined experimental and density functional theory (DFT) studies, the olefin insertion route was energetically favorable among four possible pathways. Experimental and DFT studies further revealed that the C&#8722;H activation is a reversible rate&#8208;limiting step.

The reaction of the nickel bis&#8208;boryl complex cis&#8208;[Ni(iPr2ImMe)2(Bcat)2] 1 (cat = 1,2&#8208;O2C6H4) with the small donor ligand PMe3 led to a complete ligand exchange at nickel with reductive elimination of B2cat2, formation of the bisNHC adduct [B2cat2 &#183; (iPr2ImMe)2] 3 and formation of [Ni(PMe3)4] 2 as the metal&#8208;containing species. Electrophilic attack of MeI on complex 1 or ligand dismutation of 1 with trans[Ni(iPr2ImMe)2Br2] led to loss of only one boryl ligand of 1 and afforded the nickel mono&#8208;boryl complexes trans&#8208;[Ni(iPr2ImMe)2(Bcat)Br] 4a and trans&#8208;[Ni(iPr2ImMe)2(Bcat)I] 4b.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 4&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;4&#8208;fluoro&#8208;D&#8208;sedoheptulose: A Promising New Sugar to Apply the Principle of Metabolic Trapping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorinated carbohydrates are important tools for understanding the deregulation of metabolic fluxes and pathways. Fluorinating specific positions within the sugar scaffold can lead to enhanced metabolic stability and subsequent metabolic trapping in cells. This principle has, however, never been applied to study the metabolism of the rare sugars of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Thus, we designed and synthesized two fluorinated derivatives of D&#8208;sedoheptulose: 4&#8208;deoxy&#8208;4&#8208;fluoro&#8208;D&#8208;sedoheptulose (4DFS) and 3deoxy&#8208;3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;D&#8208;sedoheptulose (3DFS). We show that both sugars are taken up by human fibroblasts but that only 4DFS is phosphorylated. We could further show that fluorination of Dsedoheptulose at C&#8208;4 effectively halts the enzymatic degradation by transaldolase and transketolase. 4DFS thus has a high potential as a new PPP imaging probe based on the principle of metabolic trapping. Therefore, we further present the synthesis of potential radiolabeling precursors for 4DFS for future radiofluorinations with fluorine&#8208;18.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Dual Core Chromophores Based on Binaphthyl Acrylonitrile Motif with Tunable Dual Emission Bands and Anti&#8208;counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small organic molecules which can emit fluorescence with tunable dual emission bands are significant for fundamental research and broad applications. In this work, two binaphthyl based arylacrylonitrile derivatives with pyrene and triphenylamine unit (BiNp&#8208;Py and BiNp&#8208;TPA) were designed and synthesized, respectively, featuring chiral backbone and dual AIE&#8208;active cyanostyrene&#8208;linked chromophores. Excellent fluorescence emissions in a range of solution and solid states were observed with high quantum yields, indicative of the solvatochromism and mechanochromism. More interestingly, dual emission bands were found and tunable by the water fraction in THF, and speculatively attributed to the balancing of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and locally excited (LE) emission in solution and aggregate states. Furthermore, the potential application in anti&#8208;counterfeiting ink was also explored, indicating the very low concentration (5 ppm) for sufficient distinguishable vision and small colour migration (28 nm) for printing on the filter. The present work provides a new strategy to design organic luminescent structure having widely fluorescent emissions in dual states and a valuable reference for the study of chiral optical materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Protein Sequencing with Artificial Intelligence: Machine Learning Integrated Phosphorene Nanoslit</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving high throughput protein sequencing at single molecule resolution remains a daunting challenge. Herein, relying on a solid&#8208;state 2D phosphorene nanoslit device, we report an extraordinary biosensor to rapidly identify the key signatures of all twenty amino acids using interpretable machine learning (ML) model. The XGBoost regression algorithm allows the determination of transmission function of all twenty amino acids with high accuracy. The resultant ML and DFT studies reveal that it is possible to identify individual amino acids through transmission and current signals readouts with high sensitivity and selectivity. Moreover, we thoroughly compared our results to those from graphene nanoslit and found that the phosphorene nanoslit device can be an ideal candidate for protein sequencing up to a 13&#8208;fold increase in transmission sensitivity. The present study facilitates high throughput screening of all twenty amino acids and can be further extended to other biomolecules for disease diagnosis and therapeutic decision&#8208;making.</dc:description>

         <title>The Effect of Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonds on the Rotational Barriers of the Biaryl C&#8208;C Axis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Axially chiral compounds are attracting more and more attention recently. Although hydrogen bonds are reported as a vital weak force that influences the properties of compounds, the effect of intramolecular hydrogen bonds on the atropisomerization of the Caryl&#8208;Caryl single bonds has not yet been well quantitatively investigated. Here, a series of axially chiral biaryl compounds were synthesized to study the effect of hydrogen bonds on the rotational barriers of the biaryl C&#8208;C axis. Experimental studies demonstrated that the rotational barrier of hydrogen bonding biaryl 9 was significantly lower (46.7 kJ mol&#8208;1) than biaryl 10 without hydrogen bonds. Furthermore, theoretical studies revealed that the intramolecular hydrogen bond stabilized the transition state of tri&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted biaryl 9, relieving the steric repulsion in the TS. We believe that this study will provide chemists with a deeper understanding of the atropisomerization process of axially chiral biaryl compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Intramolecular [2+2] Trapping of 1,2&#8208;Cyclohexadienes: a Route to Rigid, Angularly Fused Tricyclic Scaffolds</title>

         <dc:description>
Is ring strain the new h&#957;?

Abstract
1,2&#8208;Cyclohexadienes generated under mild fluoride&#8208;mediated desilylative conditions undergo efficient intramolecular [2+2] trapping, providing tricyclic alkylidene cyclobutanes with complete diastereoselectivity for the cis&#8208;fused products. Pendent styrenes or electron&#8208;deficient olefins can trap simple 1,2&#8208;cyclohexadienes or their oxygenated counterparts, with 14 substrates being disclosed. Reactions proceed at ambient temperature using just cesium fluoride in up to 91&#8201;% yield, and the necessary precursors are easily accessed from substituted 2&#8208;bromocyclohexenones. Multiple synthetic routes have been developed to install the appropriate functional groups required for [2+2] trapping.

         <title>Degradation of Penicillinic Antibiotics and &#946;&#8208;Lactamase Enzymatic Catalysis in a Biomimetic Zn&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ZnII biological metal&#8211;organic framework mimics &#946;&#8208;lactamase enzymes. The crystal structure of a novel Zn&#8208;based biological MOF occupies the central position to reflect the crucial role that its porous functional channels play in the capture, immobilization and degradation of amoxicillin. The crystal structures of amoxicillin and the degraded derivative surround the MOF, indicating the differences in the antibiotic before and after entering the bioMOF. More information can be found in the Research Article by J. Ferrando&#8208;Soria, D. Armentano, A. Leyva&#8208;P&#233;rez, E. Pardo and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301325).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A novel Zn&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; biological metal&#8211;organic framework mimics &#946;-lactamase enzymes&lt;/b&gt;. The crystal structure of a novel Zn-based biological MOF occupies the central position to reflect the crucial role that its porous functional channels play in the capture, immobilization and degradation of amoxicillin. The crystal structures of amoxicillin and the degraded derivative surround the MOF, indicating the differences in the antibiotic before and after entering the bioMOF.

         <title>SN2 versus E2 Competition of Cyclic Ethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our quantum chemical analyses reveal how the ring size of cyclic ethers has opposite effects on SN2 and E2 pathways and thus on the SN2/E2 competition. The preferred reaction pathway switches from E2, for large cyclic substrates, to SN2, for small cyclic substrates.







Abstract
We have quantum chemically studied the influence of ring strain on the competition between the two mechanistically different SN2 and E2 pathways using a series of archetypal ethers as substrate in combination with a diverse set of Lewis bases (F&#8722;, Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, HO&#8722;, H3CO&#8722;, HS&#8722;, H3CS&#8722;), using relativistic density functional theory at ZORA&#8208;OLYP/QZ4P. The ring strain in the substrate is systematically increased on going from a model acyclic ether to a 6&#8208; to 5&#8208; to 4&#8208; to 3&#8208;membered ether ring. We have found that the activation energy of the SN2 pathway sharply decreases when the ring strain of the system is increased, thus on going from large to small cyclic ethers, the SN2 reactivity increases. In contrast, the activation energy of the E2 pathway generally rises along this same series, that is, from large to small cyclic ethers. The opposing reactivity trends induce a mechanistic switch in the preferred reaction pathway for strong Lewis bases from E2, for large cyclic substrates, to SN2, for small cyclic substrates. Weak Lewis bases are unable to overcome the higher intrinsic distortivity of the E2 pathway and, therefore, always favor the less distortive SN2 reaction.

         <title>N&#8208;Oxides as Control Element for the Direction of a Sigmatropic Rearrangement: Application as a Switch for Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple change of solvent swaps the predominance of each of these two isomers: The high affinity of the N&#8208;oxide moiety for water and other hydroxylated solvents is responsible for this unprecedented &#8216;Reverse Meisenheimer Rearrangement&#8217;. The N&#8208;oxide fragment thus serves as an &#8216;on/off&#8217; switch for fluorescence and possibly several other applications.







Abstract
An exceptional level of control over the direction of the (2,3)&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement between N&#8208;oxides and alkoxylamine is achieved by simply changing the solvent in which they are dissolved. Protic solvents like water, methanol and hexafluoroisopropanol favour the N&#8208;oxide form, while other solvents like acetone, acetonitrile and benzene favour the alkoxylamine. The reaction temperature and nature of the substituents on the alkene affect the rate of rearrangement. A N&#8208;oxide fragment was attached to two fluorescent molecules and acted as an on/off switch for their fluorescence. The conversion of alkoxylamines into the corresponding N&#8208;oxides has not previously been described and is here termed the &#8216;Reverse Meisenheimer Rearrangement&#8217;.

         <title>Fibrils Emerging from Droplets: Molecular Guiding Principles behind Phase Transitions of a Short Peptide&#8208;Based Condensate Studied by Solid&#8208;State NMR
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phase transitions of short peptide&#8208;based condensates are studied by TEM and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. Structural modelling based on NMR distance restraints suggests that matured droplets are stabilized by hydrogen bonds along the fibril axis and side&#8208;chain &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, pointing to the possible role of such noncovalent interactions in liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transitions.







Abstract
Biochemical reactions occurring in highly crowded cellular environments require different means of control to ensure productivity and specificity. Compartmentalization of reagents by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation is one of these means. However, extremely high local protein concentrations of up to 400&#8197;mg/ml can result in pathological aggregation into fibrillar amyloid structures, a phenomenon that has been linked to various neurodegenerative diseases. Despite its relevance, the process of liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition inside condensates is still not well understood at the molecular level. We thus herein use small peptide derivatives that can undergo both liquid&#8208;liquid and subsequent liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid phase transition as model systems to study both processes. Using solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we compare the structure of condensed states of leucine, tryptophan and phenylalanine containing derivatives, distinguishing between liquid&#8208;like condensates, amorphous aggregates and fibrils, respectively. A structural model for the fibrils formed by the phenylalanine derivative was obtained by an NMR&#8208;based structure calculation. The fibrils are stabilised by hydrogen bonds and side&#8208;chain &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, which are likely much less pronounced or absent in the liquid and amorphous state. Such noncovalent interactions are equally important for the liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition of proteins, particularly those related to neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>Reactions of Tetra(o&#8208;tolyl)diborane(4) with Organic Azides: Formation of Fluorescent Boron&#8208;Fused Hexazenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel B2N6 heterocycle could be obtained by the reaction of tetra(o&#8208;tolyl)diborane(4) with primary alkyl azides. Experimental and theoretical studies revealed the stepwise mechanism, in which two azide molecules sequentially reacted. This B2N6 heterocycle exhibited a strong fluorescence with a high fluorescent quantum yield. In the case of using aryl, 3&#176;&#8208;alkyl, and 2&#176;&#8208;alkyl azides, different products were obtained depending on the substituents.







Abstract
The reaction of tetra(o&#8208;tolyl)diborane(4) with organic azides afforded three different compounds, diborylamines, diboryltriazenes, and B2&#8208;hexazenes having a bicyclic B2N6 ring system. The reaction with aryl azides gave diborylamines, while the reaction with 1&#8197;equiv. of alkyl azides furnished diboryltriazenes. In the case of the reaction with an excess amount of primary alkyl azide, a new heterocyclic B2&#8208;hexazenes were obtained. The formation of the B2N6 structure could be explained by one general reaction mechanism via the diboryltriazene intermediate according to the control experiments and DFT calculations. The B2&#8208;hexazenes exhibited a strong fluorescence with a remarkably high fluorescent quantum yield of up to 96&#8201;%.

The new cyanido&#8208;sulfate anion, [SO3CN]&#8722;, is a complex of the Lewis base CN&#8722; and the Lewis acid SO3. The ion the a pseudo&#8208;halide analogon of the well&#8208;known fluorido&#8208; and chlorido&#8208;sulfates. Its formation is astonishing because the oxidation of the cyanide ion by SO3 seems to be favorable. For the successful preparation it seems to be benefitial that the synthesis can be carried out at room temperature.







Abstract
The reaction of the pyridine adduct of SO3 and tetra&#8208;n&#8208;butyl&#8208;ammonium cyanide, [N(nBu)4][CN] at room temperature leads to the unprecedented cyanido&#8208;sulfate anion [SO3CN]&#8722; stabilized in the salt [N(nBu)4][SO3CN]. The anion is a pseudo&#8208;halogen congener of the well&#8208;known fluoro&#8208; and chloro&#8208;sulfates. The new anion has been studied by vibrational spectroscopy and theoretical calculations.

         <title>The &#8220;How&#8221; and &#8220;Where&#8221; Behind the Functionalization of Graphene Oxide by Thiol&#8208;ene &#8220;Click&#8221; Chemistry</title>

A controlled and orthogonal derivatization of the alkene groups of graphene oxide can be achieved by thiol&#8208;ene radical addition and thiol&#8208;ene Michael addition. The reaction is triggered by either the addition of radical initiators or base catalysts.







Abstract
Graphene oxide (GO) is a 2D nanomaterial with unique chemistry due to the combination of sp2 hybridization and oxygen functional groups (OFGs) even in single layer. OFGs play a fundamental role in the chemical functionalization of GO to produce GO&#8208;based materials for diverse applications. However, traditional strategies that employ epoxides, alcohols, and carboxylic acids suffer from low control and undesirable side reactions, including by&#8208;product formation and GO reduction. Thiol&#8208;ene &#8220;click&#8221; reaction offers a promising and versatile chemical approach for the alkene functionalization (&#8722;C=C&#8722;) of GO, providing orthogonality, stereoselectivity, regioselectivity, and high yields while reducing by&#8208;products. This review examines the chemical functionalization of GO via thiol&#8208;ene &#8220;click&#8221; reactions, providing insights into the underlying reaction mechanisms, including the role of radical or base catalysts in triggering the reaction. We discuss the &#8220;how&#8221; and &#8220;where&#8221; the reaction takes place on GO, the strategies to avoid unwanted side reactions, such as GO reduction and by&#8208;product formation. We anticipate that multi&#8208;functionalization of GO via the alkene groups will enhance GO physicochemical properties while preserving its intrinsic chemistry.

         <title>Structural Expansion of Cyclohepta[def]fluorene towards Azulene&#8208;Embedded Non&#8208;Benzenoid Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of unprecedented non&#8208;benzenoid NGs containing cyclohepta[def]fluorine unit are obtained via on&#8208;surface synthesis on Au(111). Scanning tunneling microscopy and non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy evidence their structures and conformations. Moreover, the dynamics of the precursor and its reaction products on the surface are analyzed by DFT and MD simulations.







Abstract
Non&#8208;benzenoid non&#8208;alternant nanographenes (NGs) have attracted increasing attention on account of their distinct electronic and structural features in comparison to their isomeric benzenoid counterparts. In this work, we present a series of unprecedented azulene&#8208;embedded NGs on Au(111) during the attempted synthesis of cyclohepta[def]fluorene&#8208;based high&#8208;spin non&#8208;Kekul&#233; structure. Comprehensive scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy (nc&#8208;AFM) evidence the structures and conformations of these unexpected products. The dynamics of the precursor bearing 9&#8208;(2,6&#8208;dimethylphenyl)anthracene and dihydro&#8208;dibenzo&#8208;cyclohepta[def]fluorene units and its reaction products on the surface are analyzed by density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Our study sheds light on the fundamental understanding of precursor design for the fabrication of &#960;&#8208;extended non&#8208;benzenoid NGs on a metal surface.

         <title>Materials for Electrochemiluminescence: TADF, Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding, and Aggregation&#8208; and Crystallization&#8208;Induced Emission Luminophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent advances towards enhanced electrochemiluminescence (ECL) using novel design strategies such as thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) luminophores (both donor&#8208;acceptor and multiresonance), hydrogen&#8208;bonding complexes, and aggregation&#8208; and crystallization&#8208;induced emission strategies. In many scenarios, the ECL enhancement is shown to be significant, thus suggesting future applications for thin film optoelectronics and sensing. These new avenues of intelligent ECL luminophore designs are expected to be of great importance for ECL&#8208;related research.







Abstract
Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is a rapidly growing discipline with many analytical applications from immunoassays to single&#8208;molecule detection. At the forefront of ECL research is materials chemistry, which looks at engineering new materials and compounds exhibiting enhanced ECL efficiencies compared to conventional fluorescent materials. In this review, we summarize recent molecular design strategies that lead to high efficiency ECL. In particular, we feature recent advances in the use of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters to produce enhanced electrochemiluminescence. We also document how hydrogen bonding, aggregation, and crystallization can each be recruited in the design of materials showing enhanced electrochemiluminescence.

         <title>The Best of Both Worlds: Combining the Power of MICs and WCAs To Generate Stable and Crystalline CrI&#8208;Tetracarbonyl Complexes with &#960;&#8208;Accepting Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reversible oxidation of chromium tetracarbonyl complexes with bidentate &#960;&#8208;accepting ligands is a rare phenomenon, as the resulting electron deficiency at the metal center is often accompanied by subsequent CO dissociation. The incorporation of highly &#963;&#8208;donating pyridyl&#8208;mesoionic carbenes (py&#8208;MIC) facilitates the stabilization of highly reactive 17 VE species, while retaining the &#960;&#8208;acceptor properties. In combination with weakly coordinating anions (WCA), it was possible to isolate for the first time stable and crystalline CrI tetracarbonyl complexes with &#960;&#8208;accepting ligands.

     alt="The Best of Both Worlds: Combining the Power of MICs and WCAs To Generate Stable and Crystalline CrI-Tetracarbonyl Complexes with &#960;-Accepting Ligands"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The reversible oxidation&lt;/b&gt; of chromium tetracarbonyl complexes with bidentate &#960;-accepting ligands is a rare phenomenon, as the resulting electron deficiency at the metal center is often accompanied by subsequent CO dissociation. The incorporation of highly &#963;-donating pyridyl-mesoionic carbenes (py-MIC) facilitates the stabilization of highly reactive 17 VE species, while retaining the &#960;-acceptor properties. In combination with weakly coordinating anions (WCA), it was possible to isolate for the first time stable and crystalline Cr&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; tetracarbonyl complexes with &#960;-accepting ligands.

         <dc:description>We report the synthesis of&#160;&#223;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;modified graphene oxide nanosheets, having different sized alkyl linkers (GO&#8208;Cn&#8208;&#223;CD) and their exploitation as sorbent of per&#8208;and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) contaminants from drinking water.&#160;&#223;CDs were functionalized with pending amino group and the resulting precursors grafted to GO nanosheets by epoxide ring opening reaction. Loading of &#223;CD units in the range 16&#8208;36% was estimated by combined XPS and Elemental analysis. Adsorption tests on&#160;&#160;PFBA, a particularly persistent PFAS selected as case study, revealed a strong influence of the alkyl linker length on the adsorption efficiency with the hexyl linker derivative GO&#8208;C6&#8208;&#223;CD outperforming both pristine GO and granular activated carbon (GAC), the standard sorbent benchmark. Molecular dynamics simulations ascribed this evidence to the favorable orientation of the &#946;&#8208;CD unit on the surface of GO which enables a strong contaminant molecules&#160;&#160;retention.</dc:description>

         <title>Dimension Tuning of All&#8208;inorganic Ag&#8208;based Metal Halides by Solvent Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dimension growth of metal halides is important for its properties and applications. However, such dimension control of the metal halides is rarely reported in the literature and the growth mechanism is not clear yet. A minute difference of solvent properties can tremendously alter the process of nucleation and growth of crystals. Herein, an intriguing phenomenon of dimension tuning for Ag&#8208;based metal halides is reported. The 1D Cs2AgCl3 crystals can be obtained in pure DMF while the 2D CsAgCl2 crystals are obtained in pure DMSO. Both exhibit bright yellow emission, which are derived from self&#8208;trapping excitons (STEs). The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of Cs2AgCl3 (1D) and CsAgCl2 (2D) are 28.46% and 20.61%, respectively. In order to understand the mechanism of the dimension change, additional solvents (DMAC, DMPU) are also selected to process the precursor for crystal growth. By comparing the functional group, dielectric constant, and donor number among the four solvents, we find the donor number plays the predominant role in nucleation process for Cs2AgCl3 and CsAgCl2. This research reveals the relationship between coordination ability of the solvent and the dimension of metal halides.</dc:description>

         <title>Electroactive Dyes Based on 1,8&#8208;Naphthalimide with Acetylene Linkers as Promising OLED Materials &#8211; the Relationship Between Structure and Photophysical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type small organic molecules with 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide motifs were successfully synthesised. The designed compounds are built of two 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide units linked via ethynyl &#960;&#8208;linkages with selected functionalised donor motifs i.e. 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bithiophene, fluorene, phenothiazine and carbazole derivative. The synthesis based on Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling allowed us to obtain the presented dyes with good yields. The resulting symmetrical small molecules&#8217; optical, electrochemical and thermal properties were thoroughly investigated, and their potential applicability for the OLED devices was demonstrated. In addition, the relationship between molecular structure and properties was considered by employing experimental and theoretical studies. As a result of using various donor groups, it was possible to achieve efficient electroluminescence in the range from green (DEV4) to orange&#8208;red light (DEV3) with a maximum luminance of 3 820 cd/m2 for DEV4. Upon the insertion of an acetylene linker to the designed molecules, the free rotation of D and A fragments, and hence the effective &#960;&#8208;electron communication within the entire molecule, is possible, which was confirmed by DFT studies. The obtained dyes are characterised by high thermal stability, reversible oxidation&#8208;reduction process, satisfactory optoelectronic properties and good solubility in organic solvents, which is advisable for the application in small molecular organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (SM&#8208;OLEDs) technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Intramolecular Michael Addition via In Situ Generated Aminoisobenzofulvenes: Construction of Spiro Quaternary Carbon Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An unprecedented enantioselective organocatalytic spirocyclization strategy is presented via in situ generation of aminoisobezofulvenes. The reaction sequence involves a reductive Michael/aldol&#8208;condensation/Michael addition cascade via iminium&#8208;enamine catalysis. The key success of this spirocyclization was the formation of intermediatory nucleophilic aminoisobenzofuvenes accountable for intramolecular Michael addition. Benzospirononanes featuring an all carbon qauternary spirocenter were obtained using proline&#8208;derived amino&#8208;organocatalyst in moderate to good yields and excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;20:1 dr, and 99% ee). Post&#8208;methodological manipulation of benzospirononanes was also demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Ru(II)&#8208;Cyanine Complexes as Promising Photodynamic Photosensitizers for the Treatment of Hypoxic Tumours with Highly Penetrating 770 nm Near&#8208;Infrared Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light&#8208;activated treatments, such as photodynamic therapy (PDT), provide temporal and spatial control over a specific cytotoxic response by exploiting toxicity differences between irradiated and dark conditions. In this work, a novel strategy for developing near infrared (NIR)&#8208;activatable Ru(II) polypyridyl&#8208;based photosensitizers (PSs) was successfully developed through the incorporation of symmetric heptamethine cyanine dyes in the metal complex via a phenanthrimidazole ligand. Owing to their strong absorption in the NIR region, the PSs could be efficiently photoactivated with highly penetrating NIR light (770 nm), leading to high photocytotoxicities towards several cancer cell lines under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Notably, our lead PS (Ru&#8208;Cyn&#8208;1), which accumulated in the mitochondria, exhibited a good photocytotoxic activity under challenging low&#8208;oxygen concentration (2% O2) upon NIR light irradiation conditions (770 nm), owing to a combination of types I and II PDT mechanism. The fact that the PS Protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), the metabolite of the clinically approved 5&#8208;ALA PS, was found inactive under the same challenging conditions positions Ru&#8208;Cyn&#8208;1 complex as a promising PDT agent for the treatment of deep&#8208;seated hypoxic tumours.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In the classical Inverse Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reactions between alkenes and tetrazines, 4,5&#8208;dihydropyridazines are formed. 4,5&#8208;Dihydropyridazines are rapidly converted to the more energetically stable 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridazines by 1,3&#8208;prototropic isomerization. In this study, instead of 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridazines, 4,5&#8208;dihydropyridazine&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones were obtained as a result of IEDDA reactions between tetrazines with leaving groups at the 3,6&#8208;positions, and norbornene and barrelene&#8208;derived polycyclic alkenes in the presence of moisture in air or solvent. To show that this new method works not only on strained polycyclic alkenes but also on monocyclic and linear alkenes, the corresponding 4,5&#8208;dihydropyridazine&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones were obtained in high yields from the reactions performed with styrene and cyclopentene as well. The chemical structures of the polycyclic 4,5&#8208;dihydropyridazine&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones were determined by NMR and HRMS analyses. In addition, the exact structures of the polycyclic 4,5&#8208;dihydropyridazine&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones were also experimentally proven by converting them to pyridazine&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones known in the literature.</dc:description>

In this study, instead of 1,4-dihydropyridazines, 4,5-dihydropyridazine-3(2H)-ones were obtained as a result of IEDDA reactions between tetrazines with leaving groups at the 3,6-positions, and norbornene and barrelene-derived polycyclic alkenes in the presence of moisture in air or solvent.

         <title>Visible Light and Triselenium Dicyanide (TSD): New Horizons in the Synthesis of Organic Selenocyanates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we describe a new method for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl selenocyanates by reacting triselenium dicyanide (TSD) and styrenes under blue light irradiation and O2 atmosphere. The reactions are triggered by the formation of Se&#8208;centered radical species, followed by the addition/oxidation of the styrene &#960;&#8208;bond. &#945;&#8208;Carbonyl selenocyanates and &#945;&#8208;hydroxy selenocyanates were obtained in moderate to excellent yields from aryl&#8208; and alkyl&#8208;substituted alkenes, respectively. It was demonstrated that &#945;&#8208;carbonyl selenocyanates could be used as a synthetic platform in a multicomponent reaction strategy to prepare 2&#8208;phenylimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine derivatives, which were evaluated for their photophysical properties. Overall, this new method provides a useful tool for synthesizing &#945;&#8208;carbonyl selenocyanates, demonstrating their potential for use in the synthesis of other compounds, and opening new synthetic opportunities to construct organic selenocyanate compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Insight on Supramolecular Polyion Salts: Inositol Hexaphosphate Enclosed in Cationic Macrocyclic Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular macrocyclic forces have been used to trap phytate, myo&#8208;inositol&#8208;1,2,3,4,5,6&#8208;hexakisphosphate, a key bioanion with multiple roles in metabolic processes. Due to the complex chemistry of six multivalent phosphates surrounding the small, cyclic inositol framework, crystallographic information of simple phytate salts has been elusive. This report represents a combined crystallographic, theoretical, and solution binding investigation of a supramolecular macrocyclic complex of phytate.&#160; Together the results provide significant insight to phytate&#8217;s intramolecular and intermolecular interactions at the microenvironment level. The macrocycle&#8208;phytate aggregates consist of phytate anionic pairs, each partly sandwiched by two 24&#8208;membered, amide/amine&#8208;based cationic macrocycles. &#160;The phytate ion pairs hold the tetramer macrocyclic array together by six strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Both phytates crystallize in 1a5e phosphate conformations (one axial (P2) and five equatorial phosphates). Solution NMR binding studies in 1:1 DMSO&#8208;d6:D2O indicate 2:1 macrocycle:phytate associations, suggesting that the sandwich&#8208;like nature of the complex holds together in solution. DFT studies indicate the likely occurrence of dynamic intramolecular interchange of phosphate protons, as well as important roles for the axial (P2) phosphate in both intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid Access to Encapsulated Molecular Rotors via Coordination&#8208;Driven Macrocycle Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We've got you surrounded! Conjugated units that are encapsulated within the cavities of macrocycles can have unique properties often including the ability to rotate or wobble within an otherwise stationary crystal lattice. We introduce a strategy for forming macrocycles of this type in only a few synthetic steps using pyridine coordination to transition metals as the final, ring&#8208;closing step. More information can be found in the Research Article by N.&#8197;P.&#8197;Bowling and co&#8208;workers. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301745).

         <title>Harnessing Pillar[5]arene Host&#8211;Guest Complexation To Improve pH Stability and Affect Enzymatic Degradation of the Anticancer Prodrug Capecitabine: A 19F&#160;NMR Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Improving the ADMET: The stability of capecitabine, a widely used oral chemotherapeutic prodrug sold under the brand name Xeloda, in an acidic environment can be improved significantly by complexation with water&#8208;soluble pillararene derivatives. These host systems also modulate the enzymatic degradation of this clinically used anticancer prodrug.







Abstract
Cancer is a global health problem, and supramolecular chemotherapy is emerging as a novel strategy to battle the disease. Here, we first evaluated the thermodynamic and kinetic stability of the complexes formed between several water&#8208;soluble per&#8208;substituted pillar[5]arene derivatives and capecitabine (1), a widely used oral chemotherapeutic prodrug. The exchange rate was studied, for the first time in pillararene chemistry, by the 19F guest exchange saturation transfer (GEST) NMR technique. Importantly, when we evaluated the effect of complexation on the characteristics of 1, we found that the complexation of 1 with such pillar[5]arene hosts increased capecitabine stability at acidic pH very significantly and slowed its enzymatic degradation by the carboxylesterase enzyme in a manner that depended on the host. These interesting findings could have implications on the clinical use of this heavily used prodrug and might affect the management of cancer patients.

         <title>Reactivity of [AuF3(SIMes)]: Pathway to Unprecedented Structural Motifs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Offering a hand in gold fluorine chemistry: The trans&#8208;F in [AuF3(SIMes)] can be substituted by several ligands with varying electronic properties, yielding complexes of the type trans&#8208;[AuF2X(SIMes)]. They are introduced either by using trimethylsilyl compounds or, by using electron&#8208;deficient carbonyl&#8208;bearing molecules, the latter route being new in gold chemistry.







Abstract
We report on a comprehensive reactivity study starting from [AuF3(SIMes)] to synthesize different motifs of monomeric gold(III) fluorides. A plethora of different ligands has been introduced in a mono&#8208;substitution yielding trans&#8208;[AuF2X(SIMes)] including alkynido, cyanido, azido, and a set of perfluoroalkoxido complexes. The latter were better accomplished via use of perfluorinated carbonyl&#8208;bearing molecules, which is unprecedented in gold chemistry. In case of the cyanide and azide, triple substitution gave rise to the corresponding [AuX3(SIMes)] complexes. Comparison of the chemical shift of the carbene carbon atom in the 13C{1H}&#8197;NMR spectrum, the calculated SIMes affinity and the Au&#8722;C bond length in the solid state with related literature&#8208;known complexes yields a classification of trans&#8208;influences for a variety of ligands attached to the gold center. Therein, the mixed fluorido perfluoroalkoxido complexes have a similar SIMes affinity to AuF3 with a very low Gibbs energy of formation when using the perfluoro carbonyl route.

         <title>Stepwise Functionalization of Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes with Subsequent Molecular Conversion to Control Photoluminescence Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stepwise approach combining the functionalization of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and subsequent reactions to introduce functional groups into the addenda on the SWCNTs achieved control over the photoluminescence properties and the addition of functionality in the addenda.







Abstract
Functionalization of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) has attracted interest because it alters the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photoluminescence (PL) wavelength and emission efficiency. These modifications depend on the binding configuration and degree of functionalization. Excessive functionalization reduces the emission efficiency as the integrity of the conjugated &#960; system decreases; thus, controlling the degree of functionalization is essential. Because the binding configurations and degree of functionalization are affected by the reagent structure, a stepwise approach combining SWCNTs functionalization and subsequent reactions to introduce functional groups into the addenda could effectively control their PL properties and functionalities. We studied this approach by implementing the reductive alkylation of SWCNTs by using bromoalkanes with t&#8208;butyl carbamate (Boc)&#8208;protected amino groups and subsequent deprotection and amidation reactions. The reaction products were analyzed based on absorption, PL, and Raman spectroscopy and the Kaiser test. Depending on the structure of the reagent, deprotection and amidation reactions competed with the elimination reaction of addenda, altering the PL properties of the SWCNTs. Furthermore, the elimination reaction was inhibited in the adducts functionalized using dibromoalkane with Boc&#8208;protected amino groups, demonstrating that the use of appropriate reagents enables the molecular conversion of the functional groups of SWCNT adducts without affecting their PL properties.

         <title>Vectorization via Siderophores Increases Antibacterial Activity of K(RW)3 Peptides against Pseudomonas aeruginosa</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of Trojan Horse antibiotics is introduced, consisting of a six amino acid long synthetic antimicrobial peptide (synAMPs) and a number of different siderophore&#8208;type vectors. Excellent activity and internalization by a (yet) unidentified receptor are key features of the new conjugates.







Abstract
A series of new conjugates comprised from a small synthetic antimicrobial peptide (AMP) and a siderophore&#8208;type vector component was designed and tested for activity on P. aeruginosa PAO1 and several genetically modified strains. As AMP, the well&#8208;established arginine&#8208;tryptophane combination K(RW)3 (P1) was chosen with an added lysine for siderophore attachment. This peptide is easy to prepare, modify, and possesses good anti&#8208;bacterial activity. On the vector part, we examined several moieties: (i) the natural siderophore deferoxamine (DFO); (ii) bidentate iron chelators based on the hydroxamate building block (4&#8201;a&#8211;c) ; (iii) the non&#8208;siderophore chelators deferasirox (DFX) and deferiprone&#8208;carboxylate (DFP&#8208;COOH). All conjugates were prepared by solid phase synthesis techniques and fully characterized by HPLC and mass spectrometry (including HR&#8208;MS). 55Fe uptake assays indicate a receptor&#8208;mediated uptake for 4&#8201;a&#8211;c, DFP&#8208;COOH and DFO, which is dependent on the outer membrane transporter FoxA in the case of DFO. All conjugates showed increased antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa compared to the parent peptide P1 alone when investigated in iron&#8208;depleted medium. MIC values were as low as 2&#8197;&#956;M (for P1&#8208;DFP) on wild type P. aeruginosa. The activity of P1&#8208;DFO and P1&#8208;DFP was even better on genetically mutated strains unable to produce siderophores (down to 0.5&#8197;&#956;M). Although the DFX vector on its own was not able to transport iron inside the bacterial cell as shown by 55Fe uptake studies, the P1&#8208;DFX conjugate had excellent antibacterial activity compared to P1 (2&#8197;&#956;M, and as low as 0.25&#8197;&#956;M on a receptor&#8208;deficient strain unable to produce siderophores), suggesting that the conjugates were indeed recognized and internalized by an (unknown) transporter. Control experiments with an equimolar mixture of P1 and DFX confirm that the observed activity is intrinsic to vectorization. This work thus demonstrates the power of linking small AMPs covalently to siderophores for a new class of Trojan Horse antibiotics, with P1&#8208;DFP and P1&#8208;DFX being the most potent conjugates.

         <title>Double Dynamic Structural Change Enabling Tricolor Chromism by the Realization of Apparent Two&#8208;electron Transfer to Skip the Open&#8208;Shell State</title>

The cover picture illustrates a molecule as a racing car driving on a circuit. The frame of the racing car shows the central skeleton of the molecule of different shape, which can be converted as it passes through a gate (electrode), accompanied by a drastic change in color. This cover implies that the redox reaction occurs in a stepwise manner, and they show tricolor chromic response. Moreover, the circuit represents its high reversibility. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y.&#8197;Ishigaki and co&#8208;workers. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301476).

         <title>Five Novel Silver&#8208;Based Coordination Polymers as Photoluminescent Sensing Platforms for the Detection of Nitrobenzene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luminescent silver cluster&#8208;based coordination polymers composed of Ag10 or Ag12 cluster cores and multidentate pyridine linkers were synthesized as well as luminescent polymorphic silver(I)&#8208;based coordination polymers. It was found that these coordination polymers exhibit highly sensitive luminescence quenching effect to nitrobenzene, attributed to the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions between the polymers and nitrobenzene as well as the electron&#8208;withdrawing character of nitrobenzene.

         <title>The Power of Automation in Polymer Chemistry: Precision Synthesis of Multiblock Copolymers with Block Sequence Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An open&#8208;to&#8208;air, room&#8208;temperature RAFT polymerization procedure is employed in an automated platform to produce unprecedented complex macromolecular structures unobtainable manually. The precise structures made using this machine pave the way for the next generation of material design, harnessing large databases accessible using such automated material manufacturing.







Abstract
Machines can revolutionize the field of chemistry and material science, driving the development of new chemistries, increasing productivity, and facilitating reaction scale up. The incorporation of automated systems in the field of polymer chemistry has however proven challenging owing to the demanding reaction conditions, rendering the automation setup complex and costly. There is an imminent need for an automation platform which uses fast and simple polymerization protocols, while providing a high level of control on the structure of macromolecules via precision synthesis. This work combines an oxygen tolerant, room temperature polymerization method with a simple liquid handling robot to automatically prepare precise and high order multiblock copolymers with unprecedented livingness even after many chain extensions. The highest number of blocks synthesized in such a system is reported, demonstrating the capabilities of this automated platform for the rapid synthesis and complex polymer structure formation.

         <title>Organotin(IV)&#8208;Decorated Graphene Quantum Dots as Dual Platform for Molecular Imaging and Treatment of Triple Negative Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pharmacological activity of organotin(IV) complexes in cancer therapy is well recognized but their large applicability is hampered by their poor water solubility. Hence, carbon dots, in particular nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene quantum dots (NGQDs), may be a promising alternative for the efficient delivery of organotin(IV) compounds as they have a substantial aqueous solubility, a good chemical stability, and non&#8208;toxicity as well as a bright photoluminescence that make them ideal for theranostic applications against cancer. Two different multifunctional nanosystems have been synthesized and fully characterized based on two fragments of organotin&#8208;based cytotoxic compounds and 4&#8208;formylbenzoic acid (FBA), covalently grafted onto the NGQDs surface. Subsequently, an in vitro determination of the therapeutic and theranostic potential of the achieved multifunctional systems was carried out. The results showed a high cytotoxic potential of the NGQDs&#8208;FBA&#8208;Sn materials against breast cancer cell line (MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231) and a lower effect on a non&#8208;cancer cell line (kidney cells, HEK293T). Besides, thanks to their optical properties, the dots enabled their fluorescence molecular imaging in the cytoplasmatic region of the cells pointing towards a successful cellular uptake and a release of the metallodrug inside cancer cells (NGQDs&#8208;FBA&#8208;Sn).</dc:description>

         <title>Functional Molecular Crystals from the Arylation of a Halogenoplatinum Complex: Stimuli&#8208;Responsiveness, Comproportionation, and &#960;&#8208;Bridged Dimerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A chloroplatinum complex was arylated to obtain stimuli&#8208;responsive molecular crystals. The resulting arylplatinum complex showed polymorph&#8208;dependent emission, mechano&#8208; and thermochromic luminescence as well as comproportionation and &#960;&#8208;bridged dimerization. Simple mixing of structurally similar arylplatinum complexes at room temperature resulted in transfer of their aryl groups (comproportionation), which allowed tuning their mechanochromic profiles. We also found that recrystallization of the complex afforded a dimerized product in which two platinum ions are bridged via aryl groups resulting in a very short Pt&#8211;Pt distance (3.0466(10) &#197;).</dc:description>

         <title>In silico&#160;investigation of the thermochemistry and photoactivity of pyruvic acid in an aqueous solution of NaCl</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photochemistry of oxo&#8208;carboxylic acids contributes significantly to the complex chemistry occurring in the atmosphere. In this regard, pyruvic acid undergoes photoreactions that lead to many diverse products. The presence of sodium cation near pyruvic acid in an aqueous solution, or its conjugate base in non&#8208;acidic conditions,&#160;influences the hydration equilibrium and the photosensitivity to UV&#8208;visible light of the oxocarboxylic acid. We performed an ab initio metadynamics simulation which serves two purposes: first, it unveils the mechanisms of the reversible hydration reaction between the keto and the diol forms, with a free&#8208;energy difference of only 2 kJ/mol at 300 K, which shows the influence of sodium on the keto/diol ratio; second, it provides solvent&#8208;shared ion pairing (SSIP) and contact ion pairing (CIP) structures, including Na+&#160;coordinated to carbonyl, for the calculations of the electronic transition energies to an antibonding &#960;* orbital, which sheds light on the photoactivity of these two forms in the actinic region.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Solution Phase Synthesis and Functionalization of 2D WSe2 for Ambient Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2H phase tungsten diselenide (WSe2) is a p&#8208;type 2D semiconductor from the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) family with unique opto&#8208;electrical properties. Solution phase production of atomically thin WSe2&#160;is challenging due to its instability under ambient conditions. We present a highly efficient and scalable solution method for simultaneously exfoliating and functionalizing&#160;WSe2&#160;by leveraging the noncovalent interaction between mercapto&#8208;group and bulk WSe2.&#160;Single and few&#8208;layer 2H phase pure WSe2&#160;sheets of lateral size up to 5&#160;&#181;m with minimal basal plane defects, as revealed by XPS, Raman and FTIR spectroscopy, are produced in water&#8208;ethanol mixture. Remarkably, WSe2&#160;dispersion remains stable even at high concentrations (10 mg/ml) and exhibited high colloidal stability with shelf&#8208;life exceeding a year. The findings from our study suggest that through precise manipulation of intercalation chemistry, mass production of solution processable phase&#8208;sensitive 2D materials such as WSe2&#160;can be achieved. This advancement holds great potential for facilitating their practical utilization in various real&#8208;world applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Post&#8208;modification of Robust Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient Sequestration of 99TcO4&#8722;/ReO4&#8211;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nuclear industry spent fuel reprocessing and some radioactive contamination sites often involve high acidity and salinity environments. Currently developed and reported sorbents in 99TcO4&#8211; sequestration from the nuclear waste are unstable and show low adsorption efficiency in harsh conditions. To address this issue, we developed a post&#8208;synthetic modification strategy by grafting imidazole&#8208;based ionic liquids (ILs) onto the backbone of covalent organic framework (COF) via vinyl polymerization. The resultant COF&#8208;polyILs sorbent exhibits fast adsorption kinetics (&lt; 5 min) and good sorption capacity (388 mg g&#8211;1) for ReO4&#8722; (a nonradioactive surrogate of 99TcO4&#8722;). Outstandingly, COF&#8208;polyILs composite shows superior ReO4&#8722; removal even under highly acidic conditions and in the presence of excess competing ions of Hanford low&#8208;level radioactive waste stream, benefiting from the stable covalent bonds between the COF and polyILs, mass of imidazole rings, and hydrophobic pores in COF.</dc:description>

         <title>Dearomatization of C6 Aromatic Hydrocarbons by Main Group Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dearomatization reaction is a powerful method for transformation of simple aromatic compounds to unique chemical architectures rapidly in synthetic chemistry. Over the past decades, the chemistry in this field has evolved significantly and various important organic compounds such as crucial bioactive molecules have been synthesized through dearomatization. In general, photochemical conditions or assistance by transition metals are required for dearomatization of rigid arenes. Recently, main&#8208;group elements, especially naturally abundant elements in the Earth&#8217;s crust, have attracted attention as they have low toxicity and are cost&#8208;effective compared to the late transition metals. In recent decades, a variety of low&#8208;valent main&#8208;group molecules, which enable the activation of stable aromatic compounds under mild conditions, have been developed. This minireview highlights the developments in the chemistry of dearomatization of C6 aromatic hydrocarbons by main&#8208;group compounds leading to the formation of seven&#8208;membered EC6 (E = main&#8208;group elements) ring or cycloaddition products.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We described a regioselective tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;functionalization of the pyridazine scaffold using two readily available building blocks: 3&#8208;alkylthio&#8208;6&#8208;chloropyridazine and 3,4&#8208;bis(methylthio)&#8208;6&#8208;chloropyridazine by performing selective metalations with TMPMgCl&#183;LiCl and catalyst&#8208;tuned cross&#8208;coupling reactions with arylzinc halides. Several of the resulting pyridazines were converted into more elaborated N&#8208;heterocycles such as thieno[2,3&#8208;c]pyridazines and 1H&#8208;pyrazolo[3,4&#8208;c]pyridazines.</dc:description>

Several of the resulting pyridazines were converted into more elaborated N-heterocycles such as thieno[2,3-c]pyridazines and 1H-pyrazolo[3,4-c]pyridazines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boron Polycation Supported by Cyclic Bis(carbodiphosphorane)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel cyclic bis(carbodiphosphorane) ligand was prepared and investigated in coordination with group 13 elements, B, Al and Ga. Al and Ga afforded dinuclear adduct where two metal centers were bridged by the bis(carbodiphosphorane) ligand. In contrast, the reaction with boron trichloride afforded a monomeric dicationic three&#8208;coordinate boron species composed of one boron moieties and one ligand. The structures of these products were determined by X&#8208;ray crystallography. In the dicationic boron compound, the sterically constrained cyclic structure enforced the boron center to acquire strained trigonal geometry with wide C&#8208;B&#8208;C angle of 140&#176;.&#160; Furthermore, theoretical investigation with DFT and NBO suggested a significant contribution of tricationic two&#8208;coordinate boron resonance structure supported by two CDP ligands.</dc:description>
