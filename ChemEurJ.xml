         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Dehydroxyazidation of Alcohols Promoted by Trifunctional Hypervalent Azido&#8208;Iodine(III) Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of convenient new methods for the synthesis of organic azides is highly desirable. Herein, we report a practical method for dehydroxyazidation of alcohols via an S  N  2 pathway involving PPh  3  and trifunctional benziodazolone&#8208;based hypervalent azido&#8208;iodine(III) reagents, which function as an electrophilic center, an azido source, and a base. We successfully used this mild, chemoselective method for late&#8208;stage azidation of structurally complex alcohols, as well as for a new synthetic route to the antiepileptic drug rufinamide. We also investigated the reaction mechanism both experimentally and computationally.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoswitching Affinity and Mechanism of Multivalent Lectin Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multivalent receptor&#8208;ligand binding is a key principle in a plethora of biological recognition processes. Immense binding affinities can be achieved with the correct spatial orientation of the ligands. Accordingly, the incorporation of photoswitches, that can be used to reversibly change the spatial orientation of molecules, into multivalent ligands is a means to alter the binding affinity and possibly also the binding mode of such ligands. We report a divalent ligand for the model lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) containing an arylazopyrazole photoswitch. This switch, that has been recently introduced as an alternative to the more commonly used azobenzene moiety, is characterized by almost quantitative  E  /  Z  photoswitching in both directions, high quantum yields, and high thermal stability of the  Z  isomer. The ligand was designed in a way that only one of the isomers is able to bridge adjacent binding sites of WGA leading to a chelating binding mode. Photoswitching induces an unprecedentedly high change in lectin binding affinity as determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Furthermore, additional dynamic light scattering (DLS) data suggest that the binding mode of the ligand changes from chelating binding of the  E  isomer to crosslinking binding of the  Z  isomer.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;pressure reaction profiles and activation volumes of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene dimerizations computed by the extreme pressure&#8208;polarizable continuum model (XP&#8208;PCM)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantum chemical calculations are reported for the thermal dimerizations of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene at 1 atm and high pressures up the GPa range. Computed activation enthalpies of plausible dimerization pathways at 1 atm agree well with the experiment activation energies and the values from previous calculations. High&#8208;pressure reaction profiles, computed by the recently&#8208;developed extreme pressure&#8208;polarizable continuum model (XP&#8208;PCM), show that the reduction of reaction barrier is more profound in concerted reactions than in stepwise reactions, which is rationalized on the basis of the volume profiles of different mechanisms. A clear shift of the transition state towards the reactant under pressure is revealed for the [6+4]&#8208;ene reaction by the calculations. The computed activation volumes by XP&#8208;PCM agree excellently with the experimental values, confirming the existence of competing mechanisms in the thermal dimerization of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene.</dc:description>

         <title>A New Class of Task&#8208;Specific Imidazolium Salts and Ionic Liquids and Their Corresponding Transition&#8208;Metal Complexes for Immobilization on Electrochemically Active Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of asymmetrically, para&#8208;functionalized N&#8208;bi&#8208; and terphenyl&#8208;N&#8217;&#8208;alkyl substituted imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquids and their corresponding N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complexes for adsorption on surfaces were investigated concerning their structural, thermochemical and magnetic behavior. Moreover, the development of a hetero dinuclear complex as structural motif facilitates the structural and magnetic studies of surface&#8208;adsorbed ionic liquids.







Abstract
Adding to the versatile class of ionic liquids, we report the detailed structure and property analysis of a new class of asymmetrically substituted imidazolium salts, offering interesting thermal characteristics, such as liquid crystalline behavior, polymorphism or glass transitions. A scalable general synthetic procedure for N&#8208;polyaryl&#8208;N&#8217;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;functionalized imidazolium salts with para&#8208;substituted linker (L) moieties at the aryl chain, namely [LPhmImHR]+ (L=Br, CN, SMe, CO2Et, OH; m=2, 3; R=C12, PEGn; n=2, 3, 4), was developed. These imidazolium salts were studied by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD), NMR spectroscopy and thermochemical methods (DSC, TGA). Furthermore, these imidazolium salts were used as N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand precursors for mononuclear, first&#8208;row transition metal complexes (MnII, FeII, CoII, NiII, ZnII, CuI, AgI, AuI) and for the dinuclear Ti&#8208;supported Fe&#8208;NHC complex [(OPy)2Ti(OPh2ImC12)2(FeI2)] (OPy=pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethanolate). The complexes were studied concerning their structural and magnetic behavior via multi&#8208;nuclear NMR spectroscopy, SC&#8208;XRD analyses, variable temperature and field&#8208;dependent (VT&#8208;VF) SQUID magnetization methods, X&#8208;band EPR spectroscopy and, where appropriate, zero&#8208;field 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy.

         <title>Oxidation of BINOLs by Hypervalent Iodine Reagents: Facile Synthesis of Xanthenes and Lactones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidation of BINOLs promoted by hypervalent iodine reagents is leading to binaphthyl&#8208;based xanthenes and to nine&#8208;membered lactones in high yields. In the presence of alcohols this method provides a new strategy for the synthesis of alkoxylated xanthene derivatives.







Abstract
Xanthene derivatives have broad applications in medicines, fluorescent probes, dyes, food additives, etc. Therefore, much attention was focused on developing the synthetic methods to prepare these compounds. Binaphthyl&#8208;based xanthene derivatives were prepared through the oxidation of BINOLs promoted by the hypervalent iodine reagent iodosylbenzene (PhIO). Nine&#8208;membered lactones were obtained through a similar oxidative reaction when iodoxybenzene (PhIO2) was used. Additionally, one&#8208;pot reactions of BINOLs, PhIO and nucleophiles such as alcohols and amines were also investigated to provide alkoxylated products and amides in good to excellent yields.

         <dc:description>
A Cu(I)/chiral bisoxazoline&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Doyle&#8208;Kirmse reaction of polyfluoroaryl allenyl sulfides with &#945;&#8208;diazoesters, generating chiral tertiary homopropargylic sulfides in good enantioselectivities under mild conditions.







Abstract
Herein, a Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Doyle&#8208;Kirmse reaction of allenyl sulfides and &#945;&#8208;diazoesters is reported, which provides an efficient synthetic route to enantio&#8208;enriched chiral tertiary homopropargylic sulfides. This reaction features high enantioselectivities (up to 96&#8201;%&#8201;ee) and good functional group tolerance. The alkyl substituted &#945;&#8208;diazoester has also been demonstrated as the efficient substrates in the asymmetric Doyle&#8208;Kirmse reaction. Mechanistic studies, including kinetic experiments, were conducted to gain insights into the details of the reaction pathway. The potential synthetic utility of this protocol has also been demonstrated.

         <title>Bis&#8208;Phosphaketenes LM(PCO)2 (M=Ga, In): A New Class of Reactive Group 13 Metal&#8208;Phosphorus Compounds</title>

         <dc:description>
Unprecedented bis&#8208;phosphaketenes, LM(PCO)2 (M=Ga, In) react with LGa to metallaphosphenes L(OCP)GaPML containing a delocalized &#960;&#8208;electron system within the Ga&#8722;P&#8722;M units, which selectively activate polar X&#8722;H bonds of aniline and phenol.







Abstract
Phosphaketenes are versatile reagents in organophosphorus chemistry. We herein report on the synthesis of novel bis&#8208;phosphaketenes, LM(PCO)2 (M=Ga 2&#8201;a, In 2&#8201;b; L=HC[C(Me)N(Ar)]2; Ar=2,6&#8208;i&#8208;Pr2C6H3) by salt metathesis reactions and their reactions with LGa to metallaphosphenes LGa(OCP)PML (M=Ga 3&#8201;a, In 3&#8201;b). 3&#8201;b represents the first compound with significant In&#8722;P &#960;&#8208;bonding contribution as was confirmed by DFT calculations. Compounds 3&#8201;a and 3&#8201;b selectively activate the N&#8722;H and O&#8722;H bonds of aniline and phenol at the Ga&#8722;P bond and both reactions proceed with a rearrangement of the phosphaethynolate group from Ga&#8722;OCP to M&#8722;PCO bonding. Compounds 2&#8211;5 are fully characterized by heteronuclear (1H, 13C{1H}, 31P{1H}) NMR and IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (sc&#8208;XRD).

         <title>Expanded Mercaptocalixarenes: A New Kind of Macrocyclic Ligands for Stabilization of Polynuclear Thiolate Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of expanded mercaptocalix[4]arenes, in which four 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;thiophenolato units are joined by &#8722;CH2NRCH2&#8722; and &#8722;CH2NR(CH2)3NRCH2&#8722; linkers, has been achieved. The new macrocycles do not show the conformational isomerism typical of the parent mercaptocalix[4]arenes. The potential of these macrocycles to form mixed&#8208;ligand complexes with first row&#8208;transition metal ions is demonstrated.







Abstract
The syntheses and properties of expanded 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;mercaptocalix[4]arenes, in which the methylene linkers are replaced by &#8722;CH2NRCH2&#8722; or &#8722;CH2NRCH2&#8722; and &#8722;CH2NRCH2CH2CH2NRCH2&#8722; units, are described. The new macrocycles were obtained in a step&#8208;wise manner, utilizing fully protected, i.&#8201;e. S&#8208;alkylated, derivatives of the oxidation&#8208;sensitive thiophenols in the cyclisation steps. Reductive cleavage of the macrobicyclic or macrotricyclic intermediates (6, 7, 11) afforded the free thiophenols (H48, H49, and H412) in preparative yields as their hydrochloride salts. The protected proligands can exist in two conformations, resembling the &#8220;cone&#8221; and &#8220;1,3&#8208;alternate&#8221; conformations found for the parent calix[4]arenes. The free macrocycles do not show conformational isomerism, but are readily oxidized forming intramolecular disulfide linkages. Preliminary complexation experiments show that these expanded mercaptocalixarenes can serve as supporting ligands for tetranuclear thiolato clusters.

         <title>The Decisive Role of Spin States and Spin Coupling in Dictating Selective O2 Adsorption in Chromium(II) Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using periodic DFT calculations, we have illustrated how selective binding of O2 over N2 and H2 occurs in Cr&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). In particular, the role of spin state and spin coupling in selective gas binding is highlighted. As selective O2 binding is required for oxygen concentrators, the proposed idea has high commercial value. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Pal, G. Rajaraman et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104526).

Rajaraman et&#8197;al. (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202104526"&gt;10.1002/chem.202104526&lt;/a&gt;).

         <title>Direct gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenylation of X&#8722;H Bonds with Trifluoromethyl Ketone N&#8208;Triftosylhydrazones for Synthesis of Tetrasubstituted Heteroatomic gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes</title>

         <dc:description>
The first gem&#8208;difluoroalkenylation of amines and alcohols with trifluoromethyl ketone N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones is reported. This constitutes the most straightforward approach to access tetrasubstituted heteroatomic gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes in an efficient manner, featuring broad substrate scope, high yield, and excellent functional group tolerance.







Abstract
The direct gem&#8208;difluoroalkenylation of X&#8722;H bonds represents the most straightforward approach to access heteroatomic gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes that, as the isostere of the carbonyl group, have great potency in drug discovery. However, the construction of tetrasubstituted heteroatomic gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes by this strategy is still an unsolved problem. Here, we report the first direct X&#8722;H bond gem&#8208;difluoroalkenylation of amines and alcohols with trifluoromethyl ketone N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones under silver (for (hetero)aryl hydrazones) or rhodium (for alkyl hydrazones), thereby providing a most powerful method for the synthesis of tetrasubstituted heteroatomic gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes. This method features a broad substrate scope, high product yield, excellent functional group tolerance, and operational simplicity (open air conditions). Moreover, the site&#8208;specific replacement of the carbonyl group with a gem&#8208;difluorovinyl ether bioisostere in drug Trimebutine and the post&#8208;modification of bioactive&#8201;molecules demonstrates potential use in medicinal research. Finally, the reaction mechanism was investigated by combining experiments and DFT calculations, and disclosed that the key step of HF elimination occurred via five&#8208;membered ring transition state, and the difference in the electrophilicity of Ag&#8208; and Rh&#8208;carbenes as well as the multiple intermolecular interactions rendered the effectiveness of Rh catalyst selectively for alkyl hydrazones.

The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of bicyclic pyrazolidinones through alkaloid&#8208;catalyzed formal [3+2]&#8208; and [3+2+2]&#8208;cycloadditions of in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated and pre&#8208;generated ketenes with azomethine imines is described.

Abstract
A versatile asymmetric synthesis of bicyclic pyrazolidinones through alkaloid&#8208;catalyzed formal [3+2]&#8208; and [3+2+2]&#8208;cycloadditions of ketenes with azomethine imines is described. The methodology was found to be tolerant of ketene and a variety of monosubstituted ketenes (R=alkyl, OAc). The products were formed in good to excellent yields (71&#8211;99&#8201;% for 24 examples, 39 examples in all), with good to excellent diastereoselectivity in many cases (dr 3&#8201;:&#8201;1 to 27&#8201;:&#8201;1 for 22 examples), and with excellent enantioselectivity for most examples (&#8805;93&#8201;% ee for 34 products). In the case of most disubstituted ketenes, the reaction proceeded through a [3+2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition to form structurally interesting bicyclic pyrazolo&#8208;oxadiazepinediones with moderate diastereoselectivity (dr up to 3.7&#8201;:&#8201;1) and as racemic mixtures (3 examples). The method represents the first unambiguous example of an enantioselective reaction between ketenes and a 1,3&#8208;dipole.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative C&#8722;O and C&#8722;N Coupling Reactions Using Air as Sole Oxidant**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron&#8208;catalyzed oxidative carbon&#8722;heteroatom bond formations using air as sole oxidant provide a variety of oxygenated and aminated arylamines as well as aminated phenols. The appropriate additive (Br&#248;nsted acid, Lewis acid, or base) is crucial for these couplings. The mild oxidative reaction proceeds at room temperature and represents a powerful alternative to traditional carbon&#8722;heteroatom couplings.







Abstract
We describe the oxygenation of tertiary arylamines, and the amination of tertiary arylamines and phenols. The key step of these coupling reactions is an iron&#8208;catalyzed oxidative C&#8722;O or C&#8722;N bond formation which generally provides the corresponding products in high yields and with excellent regioselectivity. The transformations are accomplished using hexadecafluorophthalocyanine&#8722;iron(II) (FePcF16) as catalyst in the presence of an acid or a base additive and require only ambient air as sole oxidant.

         <title>Structure Engineering of BiSbSx Nanocrystals Embedded within Sulfurized Polyacrylonitrile Fibers for High Performance of Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The BiSbSx@sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (BiSbSx@SPAN) composite is fabricated through electrospinning followed by sulfuration treatment. When employed as an anode of PIBs, it maintains a large reversible capacity of 790&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 50&#8197;cycles at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and superior rate performance (472&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 2000&#8197;cycles). It's one of the best performances for metal dichalcogenides anodes for PIBs to date.







Abstract
Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are regarded as promising candidates in next&#8208;generation energy storage technology; however, the electrode materials in PIBs are usually restricted by the shortcomings of large volume expansion and poor cycling stability stemming from a high resistance towards diffusion and insertion of large&#8208;sized K ions. In this study, BiSbSx nanocrystals are rationally integrated with sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) fibres through electrospinning technology with an annealing process. Such a unique structure, in which BiSbSx nanocrystals are embedded inside the SPAN fibre, affords multiple binding sites and a short diffusion length for K+ to realize fast kinetics. In addition, the molecular structure of SPAN features robust chemical interactions for stationary diffluent discharge products. Thus, the electrode demonstrates a superior potassium storage performance with an excellent reversible capacity of 790&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 50&#8197;cycles) and 472&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 2000&#8197;cycles). It's one of the best performances for metal dichalcogenides anodes for PIBs to date. The unusual performance of the BiSbSx@SPAN composite is attributed to the synergistic effects of the judicious nanostructure engineering of BiSbSx nanocrystals as well as the chemical interaction and confinement of SPAN fibers.

Thus, the electrode demonstrates a superior potassium storage performance with an excellent reversible capacity of 790&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 50&#8197;cycles) and 472&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 2000&#8197;cycles). It's one of the best performances for metal dichalcogenides anodes for PIBs to date. The unusual performance of the BiSbS&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;@SPAN composite is attributed to the synergistic effects of the judicious nanostructure engineering of BiSbS&lt;sub&gt;

         <title>Insights into the Electronic Structure of a U(IV) Amido and U(V) Imido Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the compound [U(V)(TMSI)Cl5], uranium could be stabilized in the rare +V oxidation state proven by HERFD XANES measurements. In the complex, an inverse trans influence (ITI) was uncovered. Quantum chemical calculations show this effect to be dependent on the electronic situation on the metal centre, thus increasing with higher oxidation state.







Abstract
Reaction of the N&#8208;heterocylic carbene ligand iPrIm (L1) and lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (TMSA) as a base with UCl4 resulted in U(IV) and U(V) complexes. Uranium's +V oxidation state in (HL1)2[U(V)(TMSI)Cl5] (TMSI=trimethylsilylimido) (2) was confirmed by HERFD&#8208;XANES measurements. Solid state characterization by SC&#8208;XRD and geometry optimisation of [U(IV)(L1)2(TMSA)Cl3] (1) indicated a silylamido ligand mediated inverse trans influence (ITI). The ITI was examined regarding different metal oxidation states and was compared to transition metal analogues by theoretical calculations.

         <title>Irreversible inhibition of IspG, a target for the development of new antimicrobials, by a 2&#8208;vinyl analogue of its MEcPP substrate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>IspG (also called GcpE) is an oxygen&#8208;sensitive [4Fe&#8208;4S] enzyme catalyzing the penultimate step of the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, a validated target for drug development. It converts 2&#8208;C&#8208;methyl&#8208;d&#8208;erythritol&#8208;2,4&#8208;cyclo&#8208;diphosphate (MEcPP) into (E)&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;but&#8208;2&#8208;enyl&#8208;1&#8208;diphosphate (HMBPP). The reaction, assimilated to a reductive dehydration, involves redox partners responsible for the formal transfer of two electrons to substrate MEcPP. The 2&#8208;vinyl analogue of MEcPP was designed to generate conjugated species during enzyme catalysis, with the aim of providing new reactive centers to be covalently trapped by neighbouring amino acid residues. The synthesized substrate analogue displayed irreversible inhibition towards IspG. Furthermore, we showed that electron transfer occurs prior to inhibition, which might designate conjugated intermediates as probable affinity tags through covalent interaction at the catalytic site. This is the first report of an irreversible inhibitor of the IspG metalloenzyme.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Photoactive Covalent Organic Frameworks as Heterogeneous Catalyst for Preparation of Thiophosphinates from Phosphine Oxides and Thiols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two new covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were synthesized from 4,4',4'',4'''&#8208;(pyrene&#8208;1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrayl)tetraaniline and 2,5&#8208;dimethoxyterephthalaldehyde (Py&#8208;DMTA&#8208;COF) or 2',5'&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;[1,1':4',1''&#8208;terphenyl]&#8208;4,4''&#8208;dicarbaldehyde (Py&#8208;DMTPDA&#8208;COF) under solvothermal conditions. These two COFs were further facilely developed as efficient photocatalytic platforms for the synthesis of thiophosphinates. Py&#8208;DMTA&#8208;COF exhibited better photocatalytic activity, broad substrate applicability, and excellent recycling capacity for the preparation of thiophosphinates from P(O)H compounds and thiols compared to Py&#8208;DMTPDA&#8208;COF. This methodology was further extended to the seamless gram&#8208;scale production of target phosphorothioate derivatives. The results demonstrate that COFs can provide a robust platform for developing metal&#8208;free, base&#8208;free, highly efficient, and reusable heterogeneous photocatalysts for organic transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinase Sensing Based on Protein Interactions at the Catalytic Site</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical biosensor has been developed that is based on the interaction between the catalytic site of the kinase and the phosphorylation site of its substrate for detection. We adsorbed the phosphorylation site peptide of HDGF, a substrate of ERK2, on gold electrodes and were able to electrochemically sense ERK2 without ATP. Surface chemistry analysis showed that ERK2 was bound to the peptide monolayer, which changed the packing of the layer, resulting in increased permeability of redox&#8208;active species through the layer and electrochemical sensing. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Friedler, S. Yitzchaik et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104227).

         <title>Comprehensive Characterization of Shredded Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Recycling Material</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Comprehensive characterization of shredded lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) recycling material was performed. As a result, a toolbox for analysis of these complex samples compromising various electrolyte, active and inactive materials is provided. By means of extraction and pyrolysis with subsequent chromatography and mass spectrometry&#8208;based analyses for example identification of hazardous species and polymer binder residues on trace level was enabled. Thus, detailed feedstock characterization serves as a starting point for risk assessment, tailored material treatment and targeted process control within LIB recycling. Comprehensive Characterization of Shredded Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Recycling Material (Nowak et&#8197;al.) #ProjektDEAL







Abstract
Herein we report on an analytical study of dry&#8208;shredded lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) materials with unknown composition. Samples from an industrial recycling process were analyzed concerning the elemental composition and (organic) compound speciation. Deep understanding of the base material for LIB recycling was obtained by identification and analysis of transition metal stoichiometry, current collector metals, base electrolyte and electrolyte additive residues, aging marker molecules and polymer binder fingerprints. For reversed engineering purposes, the main electrode and electrolyte chemistries were traced back to pristine materials. Furthermore, possible lifetime application and accompanied aging was evaluated based on target analysis on characteristic molecules described in literature. With this, the reported analytics provided precious information for value estimation of the undefined spent batteries and enabled tailored recycling process deliberations.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Comprehensive characterization&lt;/b&gt; of shredded lithium-ion battery (LIB) recycling material was performed. As a result, a toolbox for analysis of these complex samples compromising various electrolyte, active and inactive materials is provided. By means of extraction and pyrolysis with subsequent chromatography and mass spectrometry-based analyses for example identification of hazardous species and polymer binder residues on trace level was enabled. Thus, detailed feedstock characterization serves as a starting point for risk assessment, tailored material treatment and targeted process control within LIB recycling.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein we report on an analytical study of dry-shredded lithium-ion battery (LIB) materials with unknown composition. Samples from an industrial recycling process were analyzed concerning the elemental composition and (organic) compound speciation. Deep understanding of the base material for LIB recycling was obtained by identification and analysis of transition metal stoichiometry, current collector metals, base electrolyte and electrolyte additive residues, aging marker molecules and polymer binder fingerprints. For reversed engineering purposes, the main electrode and electrolyte chemistries were traced back to pristine materials. Furthermore, possible lifetime application and accompanied aging was evaluated based on target analysis on characteristic molecules described in literature. With this, the reported analytics provided precious information for value estimation of the undefined spent batteries and enabled tailored recycling process deliberations. The comprehensive feedstock characterization shown in this work paves the way for targeted process control in LIB recycling processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Epigenetic anti&#8208;cancer treatment with a stabilized carbocyclic Decitabine analogue</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>5&#8208;Aza&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxycytidine (Decitabine, AzadC) is a nucleoside analogue, which is in clinical use to treat patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia. Its mode of action is unusual because the compound is one of the few drugs that act at the epigenetic level of the genetic code. AzadC is incorporated as an antimetabolite into the genome and creates covalent, inhibitory links to DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) that methylate 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxycytidine (dC) to 5&#8208;methyl&#8208;dC (mdC). Consequently, AzadC treatment leads to a global loss of mdC, which presumably results in a reactivation of silenced genes, among them tumor suppressor and DNA damage response genes. Because AzadC suffers from severe instability, which limits its use in the clinic, a more sophisticated AzadC derivative would be highly valuable. Here, we report that a recently developed carbocyclic AzadC analogue (cAzadC) blocks DNMT1 in the AML cell line MOLM&#8208;13 as efficient as AzadC. Moreover, cAzadC has a surprisingly strong anti&#8208;proliferative effect and leads to a significantly higher number of double strand breaks compared to AzadC, while showing less off&#8208;target toxicity. These results show that cAzadC triggers more deleterious repair and apoptotic pathways in cancer cells than AzadC, which makes cAzadC a promising next generation epigenetic drug.</dc:description>

         <title>An allyl uranium(IV) sandwich complex: are &#966; bonding interactions possible?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method to explore head&#8208;to&#8208;head &#966; backbonding from uranium f&#8208;orbitals into allyl &#960;* orbitals was pursued. The coordination of anionic allyl groups to uranium was achieved via tethered anilide ligands, and the products were investigated using NMR spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal XRD, and theoretical methods. The (allyl)silylanilide ligand, N&#8208;((dimethyl)prop&#8208;2&#8208;enylsilyl)2,6&#8208;diisopropylaniline ( LH ), was used as either the fully protonated, singly deprotonated, or doubly deprotonated form, highlighting the stability and versatility of the silylanilide motif. A free, neutral allyl group was observed in UI  2  ( L1 )  2  ( 1 ), which was synthesized using the mono&#8208;deprotonated ligand [K][N&#8208;((dimethyl)prop&#8208;2&#8208;enyl)silyl)2,6&#8208;diisopropylanilide] ( L1 ). The desired homoleptic sandwich complex U( L2 )  2  ( 2 ) was prepared from all three ligand precursors, but most consistent results came from the use of the dipotassium salt of the doubly deprotonated ligand [K]  2  [N&#8208;((dimethyl)prop&#8208;2&#8208;enidesilyl)&#8208;2,6&#8208;diisopropylanilide] ( L2 ). This allyl&#8208;based sandwich complex was studied using theoretical techniques with supporting experimental spectroscopy to investigate the potential for phi (&#966;) backbonding. The bonding between the U(IV) and the allyl fragments is best described as ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal electron donation from two&#8208;carbon&#8208;fragment localized electron density into empty f&#8208;orbitals.</dc:description>

         <title>Planar Chiral Rhodium Complexes of 1,4&#8208;Benzoquinones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral rhodium complexes are widely used in asymmetric catalysis. They usually contain intrinsically chiral ligands that provide the desired stereoselectivity. The quinone ligand, just like the playing card in the picture, is planar and thus not chiral. However, upon coordination with rhodium, the symmetry plane is removed, and a chiral complex appears. By using the appropriate auxiliary ligand, or by taking the card with the &#8220;right&#8221; hand, one can create chiral quinone complexes with exceptional stereoselectivity. More information can be found in the Research Article by N.&#8197;M. Ankudinov, Yu.&#8197;V. Nelyubina and D.&#8197;S. Perekalin (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200195).

         <title>Evidence of Kinetically Relevant Consistency in Thermal and Photo&#8208;Thermal HCOOH Decomposition over Pd/LaCrO3/C3N4 Composite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Together photo&#8208; and thermal energy promote catalytic reactions in a synergetic way. However, how light cooperates with thermal energy is still unclear. Here, C&#8722;H bond rupture within HCOOH* was determined to be the rate&#8208;determining step, with adsorbed CO* as the most abundant surface intermediate under both thermal and photothermal reaction conditions, as confirmed by kinetic isotopic effects and in&#8208;situ FTIR characterizations. Clear evidence of kinetically relevant consistency was found under both thermal and photothermal HCOOH decomposition reactions over a Pd/LaCrO3/C3N4 composite. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Zhang et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104623).

         <title>Control of Crystallinity of Vinylene&#8208;Linked Two&#8208;Dimensional Conjugated Polymers by Rational Monomer Design</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reveal the control of crystallinity during the solvothermal synthesis of 2D&#8208;poly(phenylenequinoxalinevinylene)s (2D&#8208;PPQVs) and 2D&#8208;poly(phenylene&#8208;vinylene)s (2D&#8208;PPVs) through the Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons (HWE) polycondensation by the employment of fluorinated phosphonates and rigid aldehyde building blocks.







Abstract
The interest in two&#8208;dimensional conjugated polymers (2D CPs) has increased significantly in recent years. In particular, vinylene&#8208;linked 2D CPs with fully in&#8208;plane sp2&#8208;carbon&#8208;conjugated structures, high thermal and chemical stability, have become the focus of attention. Although the Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons (HWE) reaction has been recently demonstrated in synthesizing vinylene&#8208;linked 2D CPs, it remains largely unexplored due to the challenge in synthesis. In this work, we reveal the control of crystallinity of 2D CPs during the solvothermal synthesis of 2D&#8208;poly(phenylene&#8208;quinoxaline&#8208;vinylene)s (2D&#8208;PPQVs) and 2D&#8208;poly(phenylene&#8208;vinylene)s through the HWE polycondensation. The employment of fluorinated phosphonates and rigid aldehyde building blocks is demonstrated as crucial factors in enhancing the crystallinity of the obtained 2D CPs. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the critical role of the fluorinated phosphonate in enhancing the reversibility of the (semi)reversible C&#8722;C single bond formation.

         <title>The Decisive Role of Spin States and Spin Coupling in Dictating Selective O2 Adsorption in Chromium(II) Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Using periodic DFT calculations, we have studied in detail a Cr MOF for selective O2 binding and show that the spin state and spin coupling between the metals are crucial for gas separation.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202104526).







Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue are Sourav Pal, Gopalan Rajaraman and co&#8208;workers at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre and the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research. The image depicts how a mixture of atmospheric gases such as CO2, H2, N2 and O2 can be selectively separated using a Cr metal&#8208;organic framework where spin state and spin coupling play a crucial role.

         <title>Near&#8208;IR Charge Transfer in Strongly Interacting Diphenothiazone&#8208;TCBD and Diphenothiazine&#8208;DCNQ Push&#8208;Pull Triads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three types of phenothiazines dimers (PTZ&#8208;PTZ,  1&#8211;3  ), covalently linked with one or two acetylene linkers, were synthesized by copper&#8208;mediated Eglinton and Pd&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira coupling reactions in excellent yields. The dimers  1&#8211;3  were further engaged in [2+2] cycloaddition&#8208;retroelectrocyclization reactions with strong electron acceptors, tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) and 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) to yield tetracyanobutadiene (TCBD,  1a&#8211;3a  ), and dicyanoquinodimethane (DCNQ,  1b&#8211;3b  ) functionalized donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) conjugates, respectively. The conjugates were examined by a series of spectral, computational, and electrochemical studies. Strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) leading to new optical transitions was witnessed in both series of D&#8208;A conjugates. In the case DCNQ derived D&#8208;A system  1b  , the optical coverage extended until 1200 nm in benzonitrile, making this a rare class of D&#8208;A ICT system. Multiple redox processes were witnessed in these D&#8208;A systems, and the frontier orbitals generated on DFT optimized structures further supported the ICT phenomenon. Photochemical studies performed using femtosecond pump&#8208;probe studies confirmed solvent polarity dependent excited state charge transfer and separation in these novel multi&#8208;modular D&#8208;A conjugates. The charge&#8208;separated state in benzonitrile lasted for 30  &#8211;  40 ps owing to the close proximity of the push&#8208;pull entities in these conjugates. The significance of diphenothiazine in wide&#8208;band optical capture all the way into the near&#8208;IR region and promoting ultrafast photoinduced charge separation in the D&#8208;A&#8208;D configured multi&#8208;modular systems were the direct outcome of the present study.</dc:description>

In the case DCNQ derived D-A system  1b  , the optical coverage extended until 1200 nm in benzonitrile, making this a rare class of D-A ICT system. Multiple redox processes were witnessed in these D-A systems, and the frontier orbitals generated on DFT optimized structures further supported the ICT phenomenon. Photochemical studies performed using femtosecond pump-probe studies confirmed solvent polarity dependent excited state charge transfer and separation in these novel multi-modular D-A conjugates. The charge-separated state in benzonitrile lasted for 30  &#8211;  40 ps owing to the close proximity of the push-pull entities in these conjugates. The significance of diphenothiazine in wide-band optical capture all the way into the near-IR region and promoting ultrafast photoinduced charge separation in the D-A-D configured multi-modular systems were the direct outcome of the present study.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cocrystal Formation Precedes the Mechanochemically Acetate&#8208;Assisted C&#8211;H Activation with [Cp*RhCl2]2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we studied experimentally the mechanochemical formation of rhodacycles by ball milling pyridine&#8208; and quinoline&#8208;derived substrates and [Cp*RhCl 2 ] 2 in the presence of NaOAc. Ex&#8208;situ analysis of the mechanochemical reactions using powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), solid&#8208;state UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy and ATR&#8208;FTIR spectroscopy revealed the formation of unexpected cocrystals between the substrates and the rhodium dimer prior to the C&#8211;H activation step. This sequence of events differs from the generally accepted steps in solution in which cleavage of [Cp*RhCl 2 ] 2 is initiated by acetate ions. Additionally, the mechanochemical approach enabled the synthesis of the six&#8208;membered rhodacycle [Cp*Rh(2&#8208;benzilpyridine)Cl], a metal complex repeatedly reported as inaccessible in solution. Altogether, the results of this investigation clarify some of the fundamental aspects of mechanochemical cyclometallations.</dc:description>

         <title>Different Topologies of Hg(II)&#8208;Bispidine 1D Coordination Polymers: Dynamic Behaviour in Solvent Adsorption and Exchange Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1D coordination polymers (CPs) featuring three different topologies, comprising zig&#8208;zag, ribbon&#8208;like and poly&#8208;[n]&#8208;catenane structures, were obtained by reaction of Hg(II) ions with a novel bispidine ligand  L3  , and structurally characterized by SC&#8208; and P&#8208;XRD methods. The CPs obtained in the form of microcrystalline powders were tested for their ability to undergo solvent adsorption and exchange by P&#8208;XRD and  1  H&#8208;NMR. The extent of their dynamic behavior was then correlated to their structural features, highlighting the role of interchain interactions established among their constituting linear arrays. Zig&#8208;zag CPs proved to be resilient to external chemical stimuli, while they differently respond to thermal treatments, depending on the solvent originally included within the CP. In the case of polycatenated structure, we observed transformations where the original topology was maintained upon guest exchange, but also cases where it changed to zig&#8208;zag, even under solid/vapour conditions (  i.e.  , no complete dissolution of the CP). Given the presence of linear interconnected 1D channels,  3&#8729;ClBz&#8208;polycatenane  Pwd  is also able to trap volatile guests such as  n  &#8208;hexane when exposed to its vapours.</dc:description>

         <title>Induced Near&#8208;Infrared Emission and Controlled Photooxidation based on Sulfonated Crown Ether in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 15, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;soluble sulfonated crown ether makes very strong host&#8208;guest encapsulation with a set of push&#8208;pull&#8208;type dyes, which can greatly enhance the fluorescence emission from visible to near&#8208;infrared regions and significantly suppress the 1O2 generation and concomitant photooxidation ability of photosensitizers in aqueous media.







Abstract
Regulation of physio&#8208;chemical properties and reaction activities via noncovalent methodology has become one of increasingly significant topics in supramolecular chemistry and showed inventive applications in miscellaneous fields. Herein, we demonstrate that sulfonated crown ether can form very stable host&#8208;guest complexes with a series of push&#8208;pull&#8208;type photosensitizers, eventually leading to the dramatic fluorescence enhancement in visible and near&#8208;infrared regions. Meanwhile, severe suppression in singlet oxygen (1O2) production is found, mainly due to the higher energy barriers between the excited single and triple states upon host&#8208;guest complexation. Moreover, such complexation&#8208;induced tuneable 1O2 generation systems has been utilized in adjusting the photochemical oxidation reactions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (anthracene) and sulfides ((methylthio)benzene) in water. This supramolecularly controlled photooxidation based on the selective molecular binding of crown ether with photosensitizers may provide a feasible and applicable strategy for monitoring and modulating many photocatalysis processes in aqueous phase.

         <title>Highly Selective Lysine Acylation in Proteins Using a Lys&#8208;His Tag Sequence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 15, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A short, designed Lys&#8208;His tag can be inserted into proteins where it autocatalyzes the highly selective acylation of the Lys side&#8208;chain amine with phenyl esters. The reaction conditions of this site&#8208;selective, chemical protein modification method are mild, and no oxidative reagents, reductants nor enzymes are required.







Abstract
Chemical modification of proteins has numerous applications, but it has been challenging to achieve the required high degree of selectivity on lysine amino groups. Recently, we described the highly selective acylation of proteins with an N&#8208;terminal Gly&#8208;His6 segment. This tag promoted acylation of the N&#8208;terminal N&#945;&#8208;amine resulting in stable conjugates. Herein, we report the peptide sequences Hisn&#8208;Lys&#8208;Hism, which we term Lys&#8208;His tags. In combination with simple acylating agents, they facilitate the acylation of the designated Lys N&#1013;&#8208;amine under mild conditions and with high selectivity over native Lys residues. We show that the Lys&#8208;His tags, which are 7 to 10 amino acids in length and still act as conventional His tags, can be inserted in proteins at the C&#8208;terminus or in loops, thus providing high flexibility regarding the site of modification. Finally, the selective and efficient acylation of the therapeutic antibody Rituximab, pure or mixed with other proteins, demonstrates the scope of the Lys&#8208;His tag acylation method.

         <title>A Universal DNA Aptamer that Recognizes Spike Proteins of Diverse SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Variants of Concern</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 15, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This is a unique one: A unique DNA aptamer has been discovered that has the ability to recognize the spike proteins of the wildtype SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and its seven current variants of concern (VoCs), including B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, B.1.429, B.1.617.1 B.1.617.2 and B.1.1.529 and is predicted to recognize the spike proteins of future VoCs.







Abstract
We report on a unique DNA aptamer, denoted MSA52, that displays universally high affinity for the spike proteins of wildtype SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 as well as the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Epsilon, Kappa, Delta and Omicron variants. Using an aptamer pool produced from round 13 of selection against the S1 domain of the wildtype spike protein, we carried out one&#8208;round SELEX experiments using five different trimeric spike proteins from variants, followed by high&#8208;throughput sequencing and sequence alignment analysis of aptamers that formed complexes with all proteins. A previously unidentified aptamer, MSA52, showed Kd values ranging from 2 to 10&#8197;nM for all variant spike proteins, and also bound similarly to variants not present in the reselection experiments. This aptamer also recognized pseudotyped lentiviruses (PL) expressing eight different spike proteins of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 with Kd values between 20 and 50&#8197;pM, and was integrated into a simple colorimetric assay for detection of multiple PL variants. This discovery provides evidence that aptamers can be generated with high affinity to multiple variants of a single protein, including emerging variants, making it well&#8208;suited for molecular recognition of rapidly evolving targets such as those found in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.

A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced three&#8208;component sulfonyl&#8208;heteroarylation of vinyl ethers with sulfinates and five&#8208;membered heteroaryl chlorides is reported. This protocol proceeds via a photoinduced electron transfer process of electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor complex between sulfinates and heteroaryl chlorides, enabling facile excess to &#946;&#8208;sulfonyl and &#946;&#8208;fluoromethyl &#945;&#8208;oxy alkyl heteroaromatics under mild and catalyst&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
We report a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced three&#8208;component sulfonyl&#8208;heteroarylation of vinyl ethers with sulfinates and five&#8208;membered heteroaryl chlorides. This protocol proceeds via electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes between sulfinates and heteroaryl chlorides, giving &#946;&#8208;sulfonyl alkyl five&#8208;membered heteroarenes with high efficiency and excellent regioselectivity under mild and catalyst&#8208;free conditions. Utilization of CF3SO2Na or CF2HSO2Na as coupling partners further achieves three&#8208;component fluoromethyl&#8208;arylation of vinyl ethers, furnishing a series of valuable CF3/CF2H&#8208;incorporated alkyl heterocycles under mild conditions.

The potassium and sodium cages [{S(tBuN)2(tBuNH)}2K3(tmeda)K3{(HNtBu)(NtBu)2S}2] (1), [S(tBuN)3(thf)3Na3SNa3(thf)3(NtBu)3S] (2) and [S(tBuN)3(thf)3Na3{(HNtBu)(NtBu)2S}] (3) serve as precursors to give f&#8208;metal single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMM). Especially, the sodium precursor 2 represents an ideal candidate and the subsequent dysprosium SMM [ClDy{Na(thf)}2{(NtBu)3S}2] (6) displays an energy barrier Ueff of 513&#8197;cm&#8722;1, a frequency dependency of the dynamic out&#8208;of&#8208;phase susceptibility up to 60&#8197;K and a butterfly hysteresis up to 7&#8197;K.







Abstract
Based on the potassium [{S(tBuN)2(tBuNH)}2K3(tmeda)&#8208;K3{(HNtBu)(NtBu)2S}2] (1) and sodium precursors [S(tBuN)3(thf)3&#8208;Na3SNa3(thf)3(NtBu)3S] (2), [S(tBuN)3(thf)3Na3{(HNtBu)(NtBu)2S}] (3) and [(tmeda)3S&#8208;{Na3(NtBu)3S}2] (4) the syntheses and magnetic properties of three mixed metal triimidosulfite based alkali&#8208;lanthanide&#8208;metal&#8208;cages [(tBuNH)Dy{K(0.5tmeda)}2{(NtBu)3S}2]n (5) and [ClLn{Na(thf)}2{(NtBu)3S}2] with Ln=Dy (6), Er (7) are reported. The corresponding potassium (1) and sodium (2&#8211;4) based cages are characterized through XRD and NMR experiments. Preventing lithium chloride co&#8208;complexation led to a significant increase of SMM performance to previously reported sulfur&#8208;nitrogen ligands. The subsequent DyIII&#8208;complexes 5 and 6 display slow relaxation of magnetization at zero field, with relaxation barriers U=77.0&#8197;cm&#8722;1 for 5, 512.9 and 316.3&#8197;cm&#8722;1 for 6, respectively. Significantly, the latter complex 6 also exhibits a butterfly&#8208;shaped hysteresis up to 7&#8197;K.

A highly efficient nano TiO2&#8208;mediated carbonyl alkylative amination that proceeds by heterogeneous photoredox catalysis is reported. The use of nano titanium dioxide as photocatalyst allows efficient synthesis of diverse amines in good to excellent yields. Mechanistic studies reveal a single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer mechanism involving the photoexcitation of TiO2 to generate alkyl radicals from carboxylic acids decarboxylation.







Abstract
Herein, a heterogeneous carbonyl alkylative amination reaction that proceeds by photoredox catalysis has been developed. The use of nano titanium dioxide (TiO2, 25&#8197;nm) as photocatalyst allows efficient synthesis of diverse amines in good to excellent yields. Mechanistic studies reveal a single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer mechanism involving the photoexcitation of TiO2 to generate alkyl radicals from carboxylic acids decarboxylation. This protocol highlights the utility of using heterogeneous semiconductor photocatalysts to promote a practical and general synthesis of complex amines from readily available feedstocks.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, a heterogeneous carbonyl alkylative amination reaction that proceeds by photoredox catalysis has been developed. The use of nano titanium dioxide (TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 25&#8197;nm) as photocatalyst allows efficient synthesis of diverse amines in good to excellent yields. Mechanistic studies reveal a single-electron-transfer mechanism involving the photoexcitation of TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to generate alkyl radicals from carboxylic acids decarboxylation. This protocol highlights the utility of using heterogeneous semiconductor photocatalysts to promote a practical and general synthesis of complex amines from readily available feedstocks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Proton or Carbene Transfer? On the Dark and Light Reaction of Diazoalkanes with Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 15, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
O&#8208;H Functionalization: In this combined experimental and computational study, the reaction of diaryl diazoalkanes with alcohols is reported. In the ground state, a direct proton transfer governs reactivity with acidic HFIP. On the contrary, photoexcitation leads to formation of a triplet carbene intermediate that undergoes an alcohol&#8208;assisted intersystem crossing to a solvent&#8208;stabilized carbene that results in high&#8208;yield photochemical O&#8722;H functionalization reactions.







Abstract
The formal alkylation reaction of OH groups with diazoalkanes under catalyst&#8208;free reaction conditions finds broad application in organic synthesis. However, even today, this reaction is mainly limited to the use of diazomethane as reaction partner. In this combined experimental and theoretical study, we aim at a fundamental understanding of the reaction of diazoalkanes with alcohols to make this transformation amenable to a generalized approach towards formal alkylation reactions of alcohols with diazoalkanes. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest a direct proton transfer only in exceptional cases. In a more general setting, such O&#8722;H functionalization proceed both under dark and photochemical conditions via a key hydrogen&#8208;bonded singlet carbene intermediate that undergoes a protonation&#8211;addition mechanism. We conclude with applications of this approach in O&#8722;H functionalization reactions of alcohols, including simple fluorinated, halogenated and aliphatic alcohols and showcase functional&#8208;group tolerance of this method in the reaction of biologically active and pharmaceutically relevant alcohols.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Mimetic Molecular Selective Catalysis via Single Zr Atom Catalysis in Chelated Cage Embedded in a Flexible Piezoelectrical Matrix</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 15, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic effect of supramolecular recognition and piezoelectrical field in soft assemblies in achieving molecularly selective high performance catalysis on single atom catalyst is first elucidated. Encapsulated and chelated guest such as Rhodamine B (RhB) is effectively converted with ratios higher than 90&#8201;% after 100&#8197;min. In comparison, molecules inefficient in either cage encapsulation or chelating with the Zr center can not be converted.







Abstract
The molecularly selective catalysis in enzyme is central to life. However, their functioning mechanism remains elusive. We propose here that the synergistic effects from (i) effective orbital hybridizing and energy gap decreasing via chelating on single Zr atom as the catalytic center, (ii) selective supramolecular encapsulation in the cage, and (iii) piezoelectrical field motivation are able to achieve the enzyme&#8208;mimetic molecular selective high performance catalysis. Metal&#8211;organic polyhedra (MOPs) are added into a piezoelectrical polymer matrix to achieve the composite structure where ultrasonic treatment motivates redox reactions in the MOP&#8208;guest complex. Encapsulated and chelated guest such as Rhodamine B (RhB) is effectively converted with ratios higher than 90&#8201;% after 100&#8197;min. In comparison, molecules inefficient in either cage encapsulation or chelating with the Zr center can not be converted. This study first proposes a synergistic plot for enzyme&#8208;mimetic catalyst realization and is expected to inspire new mentality in efficient catalyst designing.

         <title>Efficient Oligomerization of Aromatic Amino Acids Induced by Gaps in Four&#8208;Helix Bundles of DNA or RNA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 15, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Folded nucleic acids with no more than 65 base pairs were found to act as amino acid polymerase for aromatic amino acids. Both DNA and RNA 4&#8208;helix bundles showed this effect, which was most pronounced for tryptophan.







Abstract
The formation of peptides from amino acids is one of the processes associated with life. Because of the dominant role of translation in extant biology, peptide&#8208;forming processes that are RNA induced are of particular interest. We have previously reported the formation of phosphoramidate&#8208;linked peptido RNAs as the products of spontaneous condensation reactions between ribonucleotides and free amino acids in aqueous solution. We now asked whether four&#8208;helix bundle (4HB) DNA or RNA folding motifs with a single&#8208; or double&#8208;nucleotide gap next to a 5&#8217;&#8208;phosphate can act as reaction sites for phosphoramidate formation. For glycine, this was found to be the case, whereas phenylalanine and tryptophan showed accelerated formation of peptides without a covalent link to the nucleic acid. Free peptides with up to 11 tryptophan or phenylalanine residues were found in precipitates forming in the presence of gap&#8208;containing DNA or RNA 4HBs. Control experiments using motifs with just a nick or primer alone did not have the same effect. Because folded structures with a gap in a double helix are likely products of hybridization of strands formed in statistically controlled oligomerization reactions, our results are interesting in the context of prebiotic scenarios. Independent of a putative role in evolution, our findings suggest that for some aromatic amino acids an RNA&#8208;induced pathway for oligomerization exists that does not have a discernable link to translation.

         <title>Cellular Detection of a Mitochondria Targeted Brominated Vinyl Triphenylamine Optical Probe (TP&#8722;Br) by X&#8208;Ray Fluorescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 15, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed and synthesized a new bimodal vinyltriphenylamine probe. TP&#8722;Br is an off&#8208;on fluorescent probe that targets mitochondria thanks to its lipophilic cationic structure. The probe was imaged by two modalities in cells: by one&#8208;photon or two&#8208;photon excitation fluorescence microscopy and by Scanning Synchrotron Radiation X&#8208;ray Fluorescence.







Abstract
Triphenylamine (TP) derivatives such as two&#8208;branch cationic vinylbenzimidazolium triphenylamine TP&#8722;2Bzim are promising turn&#8208;on fluorescent probes suitable for two&#8208;photon imaging, labelling mitochondria in live cells. Here, we designed two TP&#8722;2Bzim derivatives as bimodal probes suitable for X&#8208;ray fluorescence imaging. The conjugation of the TP core with a rhenium tricarbonyl moiety in the TP&#8722;RePyta probe altered the localisation in live cells from mitochondria to lysosomes. The introduction of bromine on the TP core generated the TP&#8722;Br probe retaining good photophysical properties and mitochondria labelling in live cells. The influence of calcium channels in the uptake of TP&#8722;Br was studied. Synchrotron Radiation X&#8208;ray Fluorescence (SXRF) imaging of bromine enabled the detection of TP&#8722;Br and suggested a negligible presence of the probe in an unbound state in the incubated cells, a crucial point in the development of these probes. This study paves the way towards the development of TP probes as specific organelle stainers suitable for SXRF imaging.

         <title>Tunable Excimer Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Isohexide Derivatives from Renewable Resources</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 15, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and economical protocol for obtaining new CPL&#8208;emitting materials starting from natural chiral scaffold was developed. By choosing the scaffold, the aromatic moiety and the spacer, fine tuning of CPL and especially inversion of the preferential circular polarization of the emitted light was obtained.







Abstract
Organic compounds showing circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) are at the forefront of novel applications and technologies. Here we show the synthesis and chiroptical properties of pyrene and perylene derivatives of inexpensive chiral scaffolds: isomannide and isosorbide. Low&#8208;intensity ECD spectra were obtained, suggesting the absence of chromophore interaction in the ground state, except in the case of isomannide bis&#8208;perylenecarboxylate, whose ECD spectrum showed a positive exciton couplet. All isomannide derivatives, with the only exception of the one containing a pyrenecarboxylate and a perylenecarboxylate, exhibited excimer CPL spectra, whereas isosorbide derivatives did not show any CPL. Isomannide derivatives bearing two pyrenecarboxylate or two pyrenylacetate groups showed positive CPL emission with dissymmetry factors up to 10&#8722;2, which depends on the conformational freedom of the appended units. The CPL sign, Stokes shift and order of magnitude of dissymmetry factor were reproduced by excited&#8208;state calculations on a representative compound. Interestingly, the mixed derivative containing pyrenic units with different spacing from the isomannide scaffold showed an oppositely signed excimer band with respect to the homo&#8208;substituted derivatives.

         <title>Strengthening of the C&#8722;F Bond in Fumaryl Fluoride with Superacids</title>

F plus: The reaction of fumaryl fluoride with the superacids XF/MF5 (X=H, D; M=As, Sb) results in monoprotonated and diprotonated species: the first examples of a protonated acyl fluoride moiety. Surprisingly, the C&#8722;F bond lengths in the protonated cations are considerably shortened.







Abstract
The reaction of fumaryl fluoride with the superacidic solutions XF/MF5 (X=H, D; M=As, Sb) results in the formation of the monoprotonated and diprotonated species, dependent on the stoichiometric ratio of the Lewis acid to fumaryl fluoride. The salts [C4H3F2O2]+[MF6]&#8722; (M=As, Sb) and [C4H2X2F2O2]2+([MF6]&#8722;)2 (X=H, D; M=As, Sb) are the first examples with a protonated acyl fluoride moiety. They were characterized by low&#8208;temperature vibrational spectroscopy. Low&#8208;temperature NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure analyses were carried out for [C4H3F2O2]+[SbF6]&#8722; as well as for [C4H4F2O2]2+([MF6]&#8722;)2 (M=As, Sb). The experimental results are discussed together with quantum chemical calculations of the cations [C4H4F2O2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2&#8201;HF]2+ and [C4H3F2O2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HF]+ at the B3LYP/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ level of theory. In addition, electrostatic potential (ESP) maps combined with natural population analysis (NPA) charges were calculated in order to investigate the electron distribution and the charge&#8208;related properties of the diprotonated species. The C&#8722;F bond lengths in the protonated dication are considerably reduced on account of the +R effect.

         <title>Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling of Aldehydes with Allylboronates Enables Facile Access to Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 15, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy for the preparation of ketones from aldehydes and allylic boronic esters is presented. This reaction involves the allylation of aldehydes with allylic boronic esters and the Rh&#8208;catalyzed chain&#8208;walking of homoallylic alcohols. This approach features mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, and excellent functional groups. Mechanistic studies also supported that a tandem allylation and chain&#8208;walking process were involved.







Abstract
We present herein a novel strategy for the preparation of ketones from aldehydes and allylic boronic esters. This reaction involves the allylation of aldehydes with allylic boronic esters and the Rh&#8208;catalyzed chain&#8208;walking of homoallylic alcohols. The key to this successful development is the protodeboronation of alkenyl borylether intermediate via a tetravalent borate anion species in the presence of KHF2 and MeOH. This approach features mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, and excellent functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies also supported that the tandem allylation and chain&#8208;walking process were involved.

         <title>Acetylene Derivatives of Cationic Diazaoxatriangulenes and Diaza [4]Helicenes &#8208; Access to Red Emitters and Planar Chiral Stereochemical Traits</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 15, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cationic diazaoxa triangulene and [4]helicene cores were functionalized with alkynyl substituents to form effective dyes and fluorophores with red&#8208;shifted absorptions (&#916;&#955;abs up to 25&#8197;nm) and emissions (&#916;&#955;em up to 73&#8197;nm, &#934;PL up to 51&#8201;%). It is further shown that compounds made of achiral DAOTA skeletons present an original dynamic stereoisomerism with a barrier of &#8764;12&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for the propyl rotation between planar chiral conformations (VT&#8197;NMR, DFT studies).







Abstract
Cationic triangulenes, and related helicenes, constitute a rich class of dyes and fluorophores, usually absorbing and emitting light at low energy, in the orange to red domains. Recently, to broaden the scope of applications, regioselective late&#8208;stage functionalizations on these core moieties have been developed. For instance, with the introduction of electron&#8208;donating groups (EDGs), important bathochromic shifts are observed pushing absorptions towards or in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectral domain while emissive properties disappear essentially completely. Herein, to upset this drawback, acetylene derivatives of cationic diazaoxa triangulenes (DAOTA) and [4]helicenes are prepared (16 examples). Contrary to other EDG&#8208;functionalized derivatives, C&#8801;C&#8722; functionalized products remain broadly fluorescent, with red&#8208;shifted absorptions (&#916;&#955;abs up to 25&#8197;nm) and emissions (&#916;&#955;em up to 73&#8197;nm, &#934;PL up to 51&#8201;%). Quite interestingly, a general dynamic stereoisomerism phenomenon is evidenced for the compounds derived from achiral DAOTA cores. At low temperature in 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy (218&#8197;K), N&#8722;CH2 protons become diastereotopic with chemical shifts differences (&#916;&#948;) as high as +1.64&#8197;ppm. The signal coalescence occurs around 273&#8197;K with a barrier of &#8764;12&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. This phenomenon is due to planar chiral conformations (Sp and Rp configurations), induced by the geometry of the alkyl (n&#8208;propyl) side&#8208;chains next to the acetylenic substituents. Ion pairing studies with &#916;&#8208;TRISPHAT anion not only confirm the occurrence of the chiral conformations but evidence a moderate but definite asymmetric induction from the chiral anion onto the cations. Finally, DFT calculations offer a valuable insight on the geometries, the corresponding stereodynamics and also on the very large difference in NMR for some of the diastereotopic protons.

         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis of Variediene Analogs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 15, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Five DMAPP analogs with additional carbon atoms or with changed methylation patterns were converted with IPP and the bifunctional variediene synthase from Aspergillus brasiliensis AbVS to yield diterpene analogs with unusual skeletons. The DMAPP analogs opened new reaction pathways through the stabilisation of cationic charges at alternative carbon atoms that are naturally not observed.







Abstract
Five analogs of dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) with additional or shifted Me groups were converted with isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and the fungal variediene synthase from Aspergillus brasiliensis (AbVS). These enzymatic reactions resulted in the formation of several new terpene analogs that were isolated and structurally characterised by NMR spectroscopy. Several DMAPP analogs showed a changed reactivity giving access to compounds with unusual skeletons. Their formation is mechanistically rationalised and the absolute configurations of all obtained compounds were determined through a stereoselective deuteration strategy, revealing absolute configurations that are analogous to that of the natural enzyme product variediene.

Cocrystallization of TEMPO with a series of dithiadiazolyl (DTDA) radicals, p&#8208;XC6F4CNSSN (X=F, Cl, Br, I, CN), led to the isolation of 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 radical&#8208;radical cocrystals [p&#8208;XC6F4CNSSN]2[TEMPO] that exhibit a common S4&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O structural motif. Computational studies reflect the robust nature of this interaction and identify a well&#8208;isolated S=1/2 spin ground state, largely localized on the TEMPO radical.







Abstract
Cocrystallization of the dithiadiazolyl (DTDA) radicals p&#8208;XC6F4CNSSN (X=F, Cl, Br, I, CN) with TEMPO afforded the 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 cocrystals [p&#8208;XC6F4CNSSN]2[TEMPO] (1&#8211;5) whose structures all reflect a common S4&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O supramolecular motif. The nature of this interaction was probed by DFT calculations (M06/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVDZ) on 1 which revealed that the enthalpy of formation of the [C6F5CNSSN]2[TEMPO] supramolecular motif from [C6F5CNSSN]2 and TEMPO is substantial (&#8722;54.0&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Electronic structure calculations revealed a TEMPO&#8208;based doublet S=
 configuration as the ground state with limited spin density on the DTDA rings (2.4&#8201;%). The corresponding spin quartet state is +78.9&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 higher in energy. An atoms&#8208;in&#8208;molecules analysis reveals four bond critical points (BCPs) between the TEMPO O and the DTDA S atoms as well as additional BCPs between selected DTDA S atoms and methyl H atoms of the TEMPO molecule. Herein, the structures of 2&#8211;5 are considered within the context of a hierarchical view of competing and complementary intermolecular interactions; in particular, the established supramolecular CN&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S&#8722;S synthon is sacrificed in order to form the new S4&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interaction.

The noble&#8208;gas difluorides, NgF2 (Ng=Kr, Xe), react with MOF4 (M=Mo, W) in HF solvent and melts to form NgF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;MOF4 and XeF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2MOF4. Structures and bonding were characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. The NgF2 ligands coordinate to the metal through F&#8208;bridges, where Fb is trans to M=O in FtNgFb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;MOF4 and Fb&#8217; is cis to M=O and trans to M&#8217;=O in FtXeFb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;M(OF3)Fb&#8242;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;M&#8242;OF4.







Abstract
The NgF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;MOF4 (Ng=Kr, Xe; M=Mo, W) and XeF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2MOF4 complexes were synthesized in anhydrous HF (aHF) solvent and melts, respectively. Their single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) structures show NgF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;MOF4 and XeF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2MOF4 have Ft&#8722;Ng&#8722;Fb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;M arrangements, in which the NgF2 ligands coordinate to MOF4 through Ng&#8722;Fb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;M bridges. The XeF2 ligands of XeF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2MOF4 also coordinate to F3OM&#8722;Fb&#8217;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;M'OF4 moieties through Xe&#8722;Fb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;M bridges to form Ft&#8722;Xe&#8722;Fb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;M(OF3)&#8722;Fb&#8217;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;M'OF4, where XeF2 coordinates trans to the M=O bond and Fb&#8217; coordinates trans to the M&#8217;=O bond. The Ng&#8722;Ft, Ng&#8722;Fb, and M&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;Fb bond lengths of NgF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;nMOF4 are consistent with MOF4 and F3OM&#8722;Fb&#8217;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;M'OF4 fluoride&#8208;ion affinity trends: CrOF4&lt;MoOF4&lt;WOF4&#8776;F3OMo&#8722;Fb&#8217;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;Mo'OF4&lt;F3OW&#8722;Fb&#8217;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;W'OF4. The [&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;(F4OMo)(&#956;3&#8208;F)H&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;F)H&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;]&#8734; solvate was also synthesized in aHF and characterized by SCXRD. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations show the M&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;Fb bonds of NgF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;MOF4 and XeF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2MOF4 are predominantly electrostatic, &#963;&#8208;hole type bonds.

         <dc:description>
A unique DNA aptamer, denoted MSA52, displays universally high affinity for the spike proteins of the wild&#8208;type SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 as well as its Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Epsilon, Kappa, Delta and Omicron variants. This aptamer also recognizes pseudotyped lentiviruses expressing eight different spike proteins of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 with very high affinity, exhibiting dissociation constants (Kd) of 20&#8211;50&#8197;pM for these viruses. More information can be found in the Research Article by J.&#8197;D.&#8197;Brennan, Y.&#8197;Li et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200078).

         <title>Cover Feature: Strengthening of the C&#8722;F Bond in Fumaryl Fluoride with Superacids (Chem. Eur. J. 15/2022)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 15, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The C&#8722;F bond of fumaryl fluoride is strengthened by protonation of the oxygen atom in a sea of superacid. The chain represents the reinforced connection between the carbon atom and the fluorine atom. The C&#8722;F bond even reveals a slight double&#8208;bond character and a formal positive charge on the fluorine atom. More information can be found in the Research Article by A.&#8197;J. Kornath, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104422).

Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) possess evenly dispersed atomic active centers and well&#8208;defined coordination structure, which provide high enzyme catalytic activity, and clear experimental model for mechanism study. Hence, the enhanced antitumor therapeutic approaches by utilizing tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive enzyme activities of SAzymes are revealed. And the corresponding therapeutic mechanisms are also analyzed.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) with specific response to the unique tumor microenvironment (TME) feature providing 100&#8201;% metal atoms utilization for high&#8208;efficient enzyme&#8208;catalyzed therapy and accurate template for the study of therapeutic mechanisms. In this review, we first introduce the various synthetic strategies of SAzymes, and the TME&#8208;responsive SAzymes activities. Next, the TME&#8208;responsive enhanced antitumor therapeutic approaches based on the enzymatic activities of SAzymes are summarized, and the corresponding therapy mechanisms are elaborated. Subsequently, a concise but concentrated summary, and the challenges and opportunities for the future design and engineering of SAzyme are outlined. As a new discipline, SAzymes have vast space for development in enhanced antitumor therapy. This timely review provides guidance and constructive suggestions for the future of SAzymes.

Next, the TME-responsive enhanced antitumor therapeutic approaches based on the enzymatic activities of SAzymes are summarized, and the corresponding therapy mechanisms are elaborated. Subsequently, a concise but concentrated summary, and the challenges and opportunities for the future design and engineering of SAzyme are outlined. As a new discipline, SAzymes have vast space for development in enhanced antitumor therapy. This timely review provides guidance and constructive suggestions for the future of SAzymes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Polymers with Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 15, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A summary of recent progress aims at the achievements of efficient room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence emission with stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior. The stimuli&#8208;responsive factors are composed of light, oxygen, temperature, mechanical force and pH. The relationship between luminescent property and stimuli&#8208;responsive mechanism is discussed in detail, and promising opportunities and existing challenges are presented as a guideline for future research in this area.







Abstract
Taking advantages of the impressing behaviors of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), the explorations in RTP materials are not only limited to efficient emission and ultralong lifetime of phosphorescence. The discovery and creation of stimuli&#8208;responsive properties have become the major pursuit, which will lay a solid foundation for future applications in RTP materials. Based on this, a review centered on recent progress of stimuli&#8208;responsive RTP materials is summarized to show frontier development in polymer systems. Different kinds of stimuli&#8208;responsive factors including light, oxygen, temperature, mechanical force and pH regulations are investigated in this review. Many potential applications and promising strategies are deeply discussed with the hope to assist future studies in this area.

         <title>On the existence and role of formaldehyde during aqueous electrochemical reduction of carbon monoxide to methanol by cobalt phthalocyanine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A long&#8208;time challenge in aqueous CO2 electrochemical reduction is to catalyze the formation of products beyond carbon monoxide with selectivity. Formaldehyde is the simplest of these products and one of the most relevant due to its broad use in the industry. Paradoxically it is one of the less reported product. Such scarcity may be in part explained by difficult identification and quantification using conventional chromatography or proton nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. Likewise, indirect detection methods are usually not compatible with labelled study for asserting product origin. Recently, the possible production of formaldehyde during electrochemical reduction of carbon monoxide to methanol at cobalt phthalocyanine molecular catalyst in basic media has been the object of contradictory reports. Applying an analytical procedure based on proton NMR along with labelled studies, we provide definitive evidence for HCHO formation. We have further identified the possible scenarios for methanol formation through formaldehyde and revealed that the formation of the intermediate and its subsequent reduction are taking place at the same single active site. These studies open a new perspective to improve selectivity toward formaldehyde formation and to develop a subsequent chemistry based on reacting it with nucleophiles.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;cell imaging has unique advantages of maintaining the in situ physiological state, morphology, and microenvironment, becoming a powerful tool to unravel the nature of intracellular nucleic acids. The analysis of nucleic acids unprecedentedly demands the sub&#8208;molecule details at segment or subunit, secondary structure and monomer levels, instead of just probing the sequence and the abundance of nucleic acids. Detection of nucleic acids at the sub&#8208;molecule level requires higher specificity and higher sensitivity, which becomes a new challenge in nucleic acid analysis. Herein, we summarize the recent progress in the design and the application of single&#8208;cell nucleic acid imaging methods at the sub&#8208;molecule level, including the visualization of RNA splicing variants, RNA G&#8208;quadruplexes in an individual gene, single nucleotide variation of mitochondrial DNA, and RNA m6A methylation. Remarkably, we highlight the key strategy, &#8220;Module Assembly&#8221;, for high&#8208;performance molecular recognition and demonstrate the required improvements in future research.</dc:description>

         <title>Marriage of Heterobuckybowls with Triptycene: Molecular Waterwheels for Separating C60 and C70</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Waterwheel&#8208;like three&#8208;dimensional polycycles have been created by fusing the heterobuckybowls and triptycene. The molecular waterwheels are excellent fullerene receptors that can be used to separate C60 and C70 from their mixture.







Abstract
Exploration of &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycycles, particularly those have &#960;&#8208;frameworks spread over the three&#8208;dimensional space, is essential in materials science and synthetic chemistry as these chemical entities possess featured optoelectronic properties and supramolecular assembly. Herein, the bowl&#8208;shaped trichalcogenasumanenes are fused onto three branches of triptycene through pyrazine units, affording waterwheel&#8208;like three&#8208;dimensional polycycles 4&#8201;a/4&#8201;b. Because the three branches on 4&#8201;a/4&#8201;b are chemically equal, the molecular orbitals of 4&#8201;a/4&#8201;b show degenerate feature that results in the strong UV&#8208;Vis absorbance at steady state. 4&#8201;a/4&#8201;b exhibit photo&#8208;induced charge&#8208;separation and subsequent charge&#8208;redistribution at transient state, leading to excited state absorption in NIR&#8208;II window (1165&#8211;1400&#8197;nm). 4&#8201;a/4&#8201;b are excellent fullerene receptors, and they form 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8208;guest complexes with C60/C70 as proved by spectroscopic titrations and single crystal structure analysis. Moreover, 4&#8201;a/4&#8201;b show much stronger affinity toward C70 than C60. Consequently, 4&#8201;a/4&#8201;b are able to separate C60 and C70 from their mixture, giving the purity of C60 up to 99.5&#8201;%.

         <title>Nanohybridization of CoS2/MoS2 Heterostructure with Polyoxometalate on Functionalized Reduced Graphene Oxide for High&#8208;Performance LIBs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To take full advantages of enriched charge storage capabilities of CoS2/MoS2, the high electrical conductivity of PDDA&#8208;rGO, the multi&#8208;electron transfer of PMo12, the CoS2/MoS2/PDDA&#8208;rGO/PMo12 nanocomposites were successfully fabricated and explored as anode materials for rechargeable LIBs. The CoS2/MoS2/PDDA&#8208;rGO/PMo12 nanocomposites show superior energy storage behavior and rate capability for LIBs, which provides a scientific basis for solving the problems of poor cycling stability and low rate capability of MoS2 as electrode materials for LIBs.







Abstract
To address the poor cycling stability and low rate capability of MoS2 as electrode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), herein, the CoS2/MoS2/PDDA&#8208;rGO/PMo12 nanocomposites are constructed via a simple hydrothermal process, combining the advantages of all three, namely, CoS2/MoS2 heterojunction and polyoxometalates (POMs) provide abundant catalytically active sites and increase the multi&#8208;electron transfer ability, and the positively charged poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) modified reduced graphene oxide (PDDA&#8208;rGO) improve electronic conductivity and effectively prevent the aggregation of MoS2, meanwhile stabilize the negatively charged [PMo12O40]3&#8722;. After the electrochemical testing, the resulting CoS2/MoS2/PDDA&#8208;rGO/PMo12 nanocomposite achieved 1055&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 initial specific capacities and stabilized at 740&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 150 cycles at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 current density. And the specific capacities of MoS2, MoS2/PDDA&#8208;rGO, CoS2/MoS2, and CoS2/MoS2/PDDA&#8208;rGO were 201, 421, 518, and 589 at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 150 cycles, respectively. The fact of the greatly improving capacity of MoS2&#8208;based nanocomposites suggests its potential for high performance electrode materials of LIBs. Moreover, the lithium storage mechanism of CoS2/MoS2/PDDA&#8208;rGO/PMo12 has been discussed on the basis of cyclic voltammetry with different scan rates.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Chemoenzymatic Installation of Hydroxy&#8208;Bearing Allyl Moiety on the Indole Ring of Tryptophan&#8208;Containing Peptides</title>

         <dc:description>
The late&#8208;stage functionalization of indole&#8208; and tryptophan (Trp)&#8208;containing compounds with reactive moieties facilitates downstream diversification and leads to changes in their biological properties. The synthesis of two hydroxy&#8208;bearing allyl pyrophosphates is described and a chemoenzymatic method is demonstrated which uses a promiscuous indole prenyltransferase (IPT) enzyme to install a dual reactive hydroxy&#8208;bearing allyl group directly on the indole ring of tryptophan&#8208;containing peptides.

         <title>Olefin Metathesis Catalysts Generated In Situ from Molybdenum(VI)&#8208;Oxo Complexes by Tuning Pendant Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deficient &amp; efficient. Molecularly defined Mo oxo compounds, MoOCl2(OR)2(OEt2), generate in&#8197;situ olefin metathesis catalyst upon activation with an organosilicon reducing agent in the presence of olefins. Their catalytic activity correlates with 95Mo chemical shift and reduction potential, pointing out the need of electron&#8208;poor &#963;&#8208;donating ligands in this series.







Abstract
Tailored molybdenum(VI)&#8208;oxo complexes of the form MoOCl2(OR)2(OEt2) catalyse olefin metathesis upon reaction with an organosilicon reducing agent at 70&#8201;&#176;C, in the presence of olefins. While this reactivity parallels what has recently been observed for the corresponding classical heterogeneous catalysts based on supported metal oxide under similar conditions, the well&#8208;defined nature of our starting molecular systems allows us to understand the influence of structural, spectroscopic and electronic characteristics of the catalytic precursor on the initiation and catalytic proficiency of the final species. The catalytic performances of the pre&#8208;catalysts are determined by the highly electron withdrawing (&#963;&#8208;donation) character of alkoxide ligands, OtBuF9 being the best. This activity correlates with both the 95Mo chemical shift and the reduction potential that follows the same trend: OtBuF9&gt;OtBuF6&gt;OtBuF3.

         <title>Fast and Cysteine&#8208;Specific Modification of Peptides, Proteins and Bacteriophage Using Chlorooximes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast and cysteine&#8208;specific modifications are reported using chlorooximes. This cysteine conjugation reaction can be carried out with single&#8208;digit micromolar concentrations of the labeling reagent under physiological conditions. The conjugates show high stability towards acid, base, and external thiol nucleophiles. A nitrile oxide species generated in&#8197;situ is likely involved as the key intermediate. These methods are applied to native peptide modification, proteins modification, and chemically modified phage libraries construction.







Abstract
This work reports a novel chlorooxime mediated modification of native peptides and proteins under physiologic conditions. This method features fast reaction kinetics (apparent k2=306&#177;4&#8197;M&#8722;1s&#8722;1 for GSH) and exquisite selectivity for cysteine residues. This cysteine conjugation reaction can be carried out with just single&#8208;digit micromolar concentrations of the labeling reagent. The conjugates show high stability towards acid, base, and external thiol nucleophiles. A nitrile oxide species generated in&#8197;situ is likely involved as the key intermediate. Furthermore, a bis&#8208;chlorooxime reagent is synthesized to enable facile Cys&#8208;Cys stapling in native peptides and proteins. This highly efficient cysteine conjugation and stapling was further implemented on bacteriophage to construct chemically modified phage libraries.

Oxidative fusion of meso&#8208;meso linked porphyrin&#8208;bis&#8208;ZnII [36]octaphyrin&#8208;porphyrin hybrid trimer afforded a triply&#8208;linked hybrid tape as the first example of porphyrin tapes exhibiting M&#246;bius aromaticity. The electronic conjugation was fully extended over the whole molecule, showing red&#8208;shifted absorption up to 1274&#8197;nm. The extent of electronic perturbation was compared with planar porphyrin&#8208;[26]hexaphyrin&#8208;porphyrin hybrid tape to illuminate the consequence of twisted &#960;&#8208;surface.

Abstract
Directly meso&#8208;meso linked porphyrin&#8208;tetrabromo[36]octaphyrin&#8208;porphyrin hybrid trimer 10 was successfully synthesized via acid&#8208;catalyzed condensation reaction and subsequent oxidation. ZnII&#8208;metalation of 10 induced transannular meso&#8208;meso bond formation to give M&#246;bius aromatic bis&#8208;ZnII octaphyrin 11, which was oxidized by DDQ/Sc(OTf)3 to provide fully conjugated porphyrin&#8208;[36]octaphyrin&#8208;porphyrin hybrid tape 12 as the first example of porphyrin tape exhibiting M&#246;bius aromaticity. Hybrid tape 12 displays significantly red&#8208;shifted absorption and small electrochemical HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap, indicating the effective conjugation through the whole chromophores.

         <title>Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction: from Discrete Molecular Catalysts to Their Integrated Catalytic Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular catalysts (metal complexes), with molecularly defined uniform active sites and atomically precise structural tailorability allowing for regulating catalytic performance through metal&#8208; and ligand&#8208;centered engineering and elucidating reaction mechanisms via routine photoelectrochemical characterizations, have been increasingly explored for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (ECR). However, their poor stability and low catalytic current density are undesirable for practical applications. Heterogenizing discrete molecular catalysts can potentially surmount these issues and the resulting integrated catalysts largely share catalytical properties with their discrete molecular counterparts, which bridge the gap between heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis and combine their advantages. This minireview surveys advances in design and regulation of molecular catalysts such as porphyrin, phthalocyanine, and bipyridine&#8208;based metal complexes and their integrated catalytic materials for selective ECR.</dc:description>

         <title>Partial Phosphorization: A Strategy to Improve Some Performance(s) of Thiolated Metal Nanoclusters without Notable Reduction of Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thiolates endow metal nanoclusters with stability while sometimes inhibit the catalytic activity due to the strong M&#8208;S interaction (M: metal atom). To improve the catalytic activity and keep the stability to some extent, one strategy is the partial phosphorization of thiolated metal nanoclusters. We demonstrated this by successfully realizing partial phosphorization of  Au  23  (SC  6  H  11  )  16  and revealing that the variously phosphorization&#8208;degreed products Au  22  (SC  6  H  11  )  14  (PPh  3  )  2  and  Au  22  (SC  6  H  11  )  12  (PPh  3  )  4  both show excellent activity in photocatalytic oxidation of thioanisole without notable reduction of stability. Furthermore, it is found that Au  22  (SC  6  H  11  )  12  (PPh  3  )  4  exhibits better photoluminescence performance than the mother nanocluster Au  23  (SC  6  H  11  )  16  , indicating that partial phosphorization can also improve some other performance(s) except for the catalytic performance.  Another point of this work is that the intermediates Au  22&#8208;x  Cu  x  (SC  6  H  11  )  12  (PPh  3  )  4  (x = 1, 2) in the transformation from Au  23  (SC  6  H  11  )  16  (Au  22  (SC  6  H  11  )  14  (PPh  3  )  2  ) to Au  22  (SC  6  H  11  )  12  (PPh  3  )  4  were captured and identified by mass spectrometry and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, which throw some light on the understanding of non&#8208;alloyed anti&#8208;galvanic reaction  .</dc:description>

         <title>Formation Mechanism of a Nano Ring of Bismuth Cations and Mono&#8208;Lacunary Keggin&#8208;Type Phosphomolybdate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new hetero&#8208;bimetallic polyoxometalate (POM) nano ring was synthesized in a one&#8208;pot procedure. The structure consists of tetrameric units containing four bismuth&#8208;substituted monolacunary Keggin anions including distorted [BiO8] cubes. The nano ring is formed via self &#8208;assembly from metal precursors in aqueous acidic medium. The compound (NH 4 ) 16 [(BiPMo 11 O 39 ) 4 ]&#215;22H 2 O; (P 4 Bi 4 Mo 44 ) was characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS), Raman spectroscopy, matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionisation&#8208;time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI&#8208;TOF), and thermogravimetry/differential scanning calorimetry (TG&#8208;DSC&#8208;MS). The formation of the nano ring in solution was studied by time&#8208;resolved in situ small&#8208; and wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS) and in situ EXAFS measurements at the Mo&#8208;K and the Bi&#8208;L 3 edge indicating a two&#8208;step process consisting of condensation of Mo&#8208;anions and formation of Bi&#8208;Mo&#8208;units followed by a rapid self&#8208;assembly to yield the final tetrameric ring structure.</dc:description>

For  6  , a hemiester was generated by an  in situ  linker transformation. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed all structures to be sustained by B(O)&#8211;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N, B(O)&#8211;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O, O  w  &#8211;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O, O  w  &#8211;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N, C&#8211;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O, C&#8211;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N, &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;, and C&#8211;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; forces. The cocrystals comprise 1D, 2D, and 3D hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks with components that display reactivities upon cocrystal formation and within the solids. In  1  and  3  , the C=C bonds of the  bpe  molecules undergo a [2+2] photodimerization. UV radiation of each compound resulted in quantitative conversion of  bpe  into cyclobutane  tpcb  . The reactivity involving  1  occurred via 1D&#8208;to&#8208;2D single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformation. Our work supports the feasibility of the diboronic acids as formidable structural and reactivity building blocks for cocrystal construction.</dc:description>

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction revealed all structures to be sustained by B(O)&#8211;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N, B(O)&#8211;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O, O  w  &#8211;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O, O  w  &#8211;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N, C&#8211;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O, C&#8211;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N, &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;, and C&#8211;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; forces. The cocrystals comprise 1D, 2D, and 3D hydrogen-bonded frameworks with components that display reactivities upon cocrystal formation and within the solids. In  1  and  3  , the C=C bonds of the  bpe  molecules undergo a [2+2] photodimerization. UV radiation of each compound resulted in quantitative conversion of  bpe  into cyclobutane  tpcb  . The reactivity involving  1  occurred via 1D-to-2D single-crystal-to-single-crystal (SCSC) transformation. Our work supports the feasibility of the diboronic acids as formidable structural and reactivity building blocks for cocrystal construction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sulfonyl Nitrene and Amidyl Radical: Structure and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic generation of nitrenes and radicals can be used to tune or even control their reactivity. Photocatalytic activation of sulfonyl azides leads to the elimination of N  2  and the resulting reactive species initiate C&#8208;H activations and amide formation reactions. Here, we present reactive radicals that are generated from sulfonyl azides: sulfonyl nitrene radical anion, sulfonyl nitrene and sulfonyl amidyl radical, and test their gas phase reactivity in C&#8208;H activation reactions. The sulfonyl nitrene radical anion is the least reactive and its reactivity is governed by the proton coupled electron transfer mechanism. In contrast, sulfonyl nitrene and sulfonyl amidyl radicals react via hydrogen atom transfer pathways. These reactivities and detailed characterization of the radicals with vibrational spectroscopy and with DFT calculations provide information necessary for taking control over the reactivity of these intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis and Structure Correction of the Cyclic Lipodepsipeptide Orfamide A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the total synthesis of orfamide A an efficient synthesis format for cyclic lipodepsipeptide natural products on solid phase was developed. A strategy using side chain anchoring, an ester building block, and O&#8594;N acyl migration suppression enabled high&#8208;yielding synthesis on solid support and facilitated compound library synthesis. The configuration of the proposed structure of orfamide A was corrected at two positions. Studies in Chlamydomonas algae uncovered the impact of orfamide A stereochemistry on compound bioactivity.







Abstract
A total synthesis of the cyclic lipodepsipeptide natural product orfamide A was achieved. By developing a synthesis format using an aminoacid ester building block and SPPS protocol adaptation, a focused library of target compounds was obtained, in high yield and purity. Spectral and LC&#8208;HRMS data of all library members with the isolated natural product identified the 5Leu residue to be d&#8208; and the 3&#8217;&#8208;OH group to be R&#8208;configured. The structural correction of orfamide A by chemical synthesis and analysis was confirmed by biological activity comparison in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, which indicated compound configuration to be important for bioactivity. Acute toxicity was also found against Trypanosoma brucei, the parasite causing African sleeping sickness.

         <title>Transition metal doping induces Ti3+ to promote the performance of SrTiO3@TiO2 visible light photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to prepare C1 product</title>

         <dc:description>The transition metal Fe, Co, Ni and Cu doped strontium titanate&#8208;rich SrTiO  3  @TiO  2  (STO@T) materials were prepared by hydrothermal method. The prepared doped materials exhibit better photocatalytic CO  2  reduction to CH  4  ability under visible light conditions. Among them, Fe&#8208;doped and undoped SrTiO  3  @TiO  2  under visible light conditions CO  2  reduction products only CO, while M&#8208;STO@T (M=Co, Ni, Cu) samples converted CO  2  to CH  4  . The average methane yield of Ni&#8208;doped STO@T samples are as high as 73.85 &#956;mol&#183;g  &#8208;1  &#183;h  &#8208;1  . The production of methane is mainly due to the increase in the response of the doped samples to visible light. And the increase in the separation rate of photogenerated electrons and holes and the efficiency of electron transport caused by the generation of impurity levels. The impurity level caused by Ti  3+  plays an important role in the production of methane by CO  2  visible light reduction. Ni doping effectively improves the photocatalytic performance of STO@T and CO  2  reduction mechanism were explained.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>All&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) have attracted considerable attention owing to their pronounced advantages of excellent mechanical flexibility/stretchability and greatly enhanced device stability as compared to other types of organic solar cells (OSCs). Thanks to the extensive research efforts dedicated to the development of polymer acceptors, all&#8208;PSCs have achieved remarkable improvement of photovoltaic performance, recently. This review summarizes the recent progress o  f polymer acceptors based on the key electron&#8208;deficient building blocks,  which  include bithiophene diimide (BTI) derivatives,  boron&#8208;nitrogen coordination bond (B&#8592;N)&#8208;incorporated (hetero)arenes, cyano&#8208;functionalized (hetero)arenes, and fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (FREAs). In addition, single&#8208;component&#8208;based all&#8208;PSCs are also briefly discussed. The structure&#8208;property correlations of polymer acceptors are elaborated in details.

         <title>The non&#8208;ancillary nature of trimethylsilylamide substituents in boranes and borinium cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The known boranes [((R(Me  3  Si)N)  2  BF (R = Me  3  Si  1  , t  Bu  2  , C  6  F  5  3,  o&#8208;tol  4  , Mes  5  , Dipp  6  ) and borinium salts [((R(Me  3  Si)N)  2  B][B(C  6  F  5  )  4  ] (R = Me  3  Si  7  ,  t  Bu  8  ) are prepared and fully characterized. Compound  7  is shown to react with phosphines to generate [R  3  PSiMe  3  ]  +  and [R  3  PH]  +  (R = Me,  t  Bu). Efforts to generate related borinium cations via fluoride abstraction from ((R(Me  3  Si)N)  2  BF (R = C  6  F  5  3,  o&#8208;tol  4  , Mes  5  ) gave complex mixtures suggesting multiple reaction pathways. However for R = Dipp  6,  the species [(m&#8208;F)(SiMe  2  N(dipp))  2  BMe][B(C  6  F  5  )  4  ] was isolated as the major product, indicating methyl abstraction from silicon and F/Me exchange on boron. These observations together with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art DFT mechanistic studies reveal that the trimethylsilyl&#8208;substituents do not behave as ancillary subsitutents but rather act as sources of proton, SiMe  3  and methyl groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereodivergent Desymmetrization of Simple Dicarboxylates via Branch&#8208;Selective Pd/Cu Catalyzed Allylic Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric desymmetrization has been demonstrated to be a powerful strategy for building stereocenters in asymmetric synthesis. Herein, a Pd/Cu catalyzed asymmetric desymmetrization reaction with a simple geminal dicarboxylate is reported. A wide scope of imino esters bearing an aryl or heteroaromatic group were compatible with this bimetallic catalytic system. The reactions proceeded smoothly, giving the desired products in good yields with high to excellent regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivity (up to 20:1 B:L, &gt;20:1 dr, &gt;99% ee). Notably, the reaction favored branched selectivity, which is unusual for the Pd&#8208;catalyzed allylic alkylation reaction. In addition, the standard product could be easily transformed to other valuable molecules such as chiral allylic alcohols, carbamates, and organic boron compounds. Furthermore, DFT calculations were conducted to explain the origin of the branched selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Disclosing Cyclic(Alkyl)(Amino)Carbenes as a One&#8208;Electron Reductant: Synthesis of Acyclic(Amino)(Aryl)Carbene&#8208;Based Kekul&#233; Diradicaloids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we disclose cyclic(alkyl)(amino)carbenes (CAACs) as a one&#8208;electron reductant under the formation of a transient radical cation as indicated by EPR spectroscopy. Subsequently, the disclosed CAAC reducing reactivity was utilized for the synthesis of acyclic(amino)(aryl)carbene&#8208;based Thiele and Chichibabin hydrocarbons, a new class of Kekul&#233; diradicaloids. The results demonstrate the CAAC to be a potent organic reductant. Notably, the acyclic(amino)(aryl)carbene&#8208;based Chichibabin&#8217;s hydrocarbon shows an appreciable population of the triplet state at room temperature, as evidenced by both variable temperature NMR and EPR spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Perovskite Photovoltaics for Artificial Light Harvesting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskites have encountered a growing interest as light&#8208;absorbing materials for harvesting and recycling ambient light. This interest comes from distinct and impressive intrinsic properties of these materials and is necessitated by the need for reliable and sustainable power supplies for wearable and portable internet of things (IoT) applications. Perovskite artificial light cells (PALCs; i.e., indoor perovskite photovoltaics) have been intensively explored, and thus their device performance has been rapidly augmented. In this review, we summarize and consolidate the research outputs of PALCs by focusing on the tuning of photo&#8208;absorber and interlayer materials for efficient harvest and collection of artificial light sources. We also emphasize various challenges and possible future research directions that should be addressed for realizing a large market uptake of PALCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;induced donor state destabilisation &#8211; a new route to panchromatically absorbing Cu(I) complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intense absorption of light to covering a large part of the visible spectrum is highly desirable for solar energy conversion schemes. To this end, we have developed novel anionic bis(4  H  &#8208;imidazolato)Cu(I) complexes (cuprates), which feature intense, panchromatic light absorption properties throughout the visible spectrum and into the NIR region with extinction coefficients up to 28,000&#160;M  &#8722;1  cm  &#8722;1  . Steady&#8208;state absorption, (spectro)electrochemical and theoretical investigations reveal low energy (Vis to NIR) metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer absorption bands, which are a consequence of destabilized copper&#8208;based donor states. These high&#8208;lying copper&#8208;based states are induced by the &#963;&#8208;donation of the chelating anionic ligands, which also feature low energy acceptor states. The optical properties are reflected in very low, copper&#8208;based oxidation potentials and three ligand&#8208;based reduction events. These electronic features reveal a new route to panchromatically absorbing Cu(I) complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Sigma/pi Bonding Preferences of Solvated Alkali&#8208;Metal Cations to Ditopic Arylmethyl Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selection of diarylmethanes have been deprotonated at the bridgehead by alkali&#8208;metal bases and then trapped as monomers with polydentate N&#8208;donors to probe the different sigma/pi preferences of the resulting potentially ditopic anions towards the Li, Na or K cations. X&#8208;ray crystallography, multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations have been employed to interrogate the nature of these interactions across all three phases.







Abstract
Arylmethyl anions allow alkali&#8208;metals to bind in a &#963;&#8208;fashion to the lateral carbanionic centre or a &#960;&#8208;fashion to the aryl ring or in between these extremities, with the trend towards &#960; bonding increasing on descending group 1. Here we review known alkali metal structures of diphenylmethane, fluorene, 2&#8208;benzylpyridine and 4&#8208;benzylpyridine. Next, we synthesise Li, Na, K monomers of these diarylmethyls using polydentate donors PMDETA or Me6TREN to remove competing oligomerizing interactions, studying the effect that two aromatic rings has on negative charge (de)localisation via NMR, X&#8208;ray crystallographic and DFT studies. Diphenylmethyl and fluorenyl anions maintain C(H)&#8722;M interactions regardless of alkali&#8208;metal, although the adjacent arene carbons engage in interactions with larger alkali&#8208;metals. Introducing a nitrogen atom into the ring (at the 2&#8208; or 4&#8208;position) encourages relocalisation of negative charge away from the deprotonated carbon and onto nitrogen. Phenyl(2&#8208;pyridyl)methyl moves from an enamide formation at one extremity (lithium) to an aza&#8208;allyl formation at the other extremity (potassium), while C&#8208; or N&#8208;coordination modes become energetically viable for Na and K phenyl(4&#8208;pyridyl)methyl complexes.

         <title>Deciphering Internal and External &#960;&#8208;Conjugation in C3&#8208;Symmetric Multiple Azobenzene Connected Systems in Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two tripodal C3&#8208;symmetric photoswitchable molecular systems are reported that have extended conjugation at external and internal positions. The influence of the extended &#960;&#8208;bonds in their absorption properties, thermal relaxation of the photoisomers and their propensities in forming supramolecular self&#8208;assemblies have been explored through spectroscopy, and microscopic studies. Remarkably, the position of the acryl group influences the supramolecular assembly, and also in the formation of photoresponsive organic hydrogels or microcrystals.







Abstract
Two tripodal C3&#8208;symmetric photoswitchable molecular systems T1 and T2 are reported that have extended conjugation at external and internal positions using an acryl group. The influence of the extended &#960;&#8208;bonds in their absorption properties, thermal relaxation of the photoisomers and their propensities in forming supramolecular self&#8208;assemblies have been explored through spectroscopy, and microscopic studies. In particular, the investigations on the self&#8208;assembly have been carried out using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), polarized optical microscopy (POM), X&#8208;ray diffraction studies (XRD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Remarkably, the position of the acryl group influences the behaviour of the two target molecules in supramolecular assembly, and also in the formation of photoresponsive organic hydrogels or microcrystals.

         <title>Rapid and High&#8208;Throughput SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA Detection without RNA Extraction and Amplification by Using a Microfluidic Biochip</title>

Rapid, ultrasensitive, extraction&#8208;free and amplification&#8208;free strategy for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome&#8208;coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) RNA using a microfluidic biochip that exhibits an ultralow detection limit (600&#8197;copies&#8201;mL&#8722;1) and the ability to simultaneously evaluate 15&#8197;RNA samples within 40&#8197;min. The proposed RNA detection strategy has prospective applications in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 detection and COVID&#8208;19 (Corona virus disease 2019) patient diagnosis.







Abstract
The ongoing outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome&#8208;coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) has spread globally and poses a threat to public health and National economic development. Rapid and high&#8208;throughput SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA detection without the need of RNA extraction and amplification remain a key challenge. In this study, a new SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA detection strategy using a microfluidic biochip for the rapid and ultrasensitive detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 without RNA extraction and amplification was developed. This new strategy takes advantage of the specific SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA and probe DNA reaction in the microfluidic channel, fluorescence signal regulation by nanomaterials, and accurate sample control by the microfluidic chip. It presents an ultralow limit of detection of 600 copies&#8201;mL&#8722;1 in a large linear detection regime from 1 aM to 100&#8197;fM. Fifteen samples were simultaneously detected in 40&#8197;min without the need for RNA purification and amplification. The detection accuracy of the strategy was validated through quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT&#8208;PCR), with a recovery of 99&#8211;113&#8201;%. Therefore, the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA detection strategy proposed in this study can potentially be used for the quantitative diagnosis of viral infectious diseases.

         <title>A Combined Spectroscopic and Theoretical Study on a Ruthenium Complex Featuring a &#960;&#8208;Extended dppz Ligand for Light&#8208;Driven Accumulation of Multiple Reducing Equivalents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photophysical properties of a charge&#8208;photoaccumulating ruthenium complex are deciphered by mean of excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent resonance Raman, steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved absorption and emission spectroscopies, in combination with time&#8208;dependent density functional theory. This study sheds light on the decisive role played by the pyridoquinolinone subunit of the &#960;&#8208;extended dppz ligand in the photoinduced processes.







Abstract
The design of photoactive systems capable of storing and relaying multiple electrons is highly demanded in the field of artificial photosynthesis, where transformations of interest rely on multielectronic redox processes. The photophysical properties of the ruthenium photosensitizer [(bpy)2Ru(oxim&#8208;dppqp)]2+ (Ru), storing two electrons coupled to two protons on the &#960;&#8208;extended oxim&#8208;dppqp ligand under light&#8208;driven conditions, are investigated by means of excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent resonance Raman and transient absorption spectroscopies, in combination with time&#8208;dependent density functional theory; the results are discussed in comparison to the parent [(bpy)2Ru(dppz)]2+ and [(bpy)2Ru(oxo&#8208;dppqp)]2+ complexes. In addition, this study provides in&#8208;depth insights on the impact of protonation or of accumulation of multiple reducing equivalents on the reactive excited states.

         <title>The varied Frustrated Lewis Pair Reactivity of the Germylene Phosphaketene (CH{(CMe)(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3N)}2)GePCO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The germylene species (CH{(CMe)(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3N)}2)GePCO 1 is shown to react with the Lewis acids (E(C6F5)3 E = B, Al). Nonetheless, 1 participates in FLP chemistry with electron deficient alkynes or olefins, acting as an intramolecular FLP. In contrast, in the presence of B(C6F5)3 and an electron rich alkyne, 1 behaves as Ge&#8208;based nucleophile to effect intermolecular FLP addition to the alkyne. This reactivity demonstrates that the reaction pathway is controlled by the nature of the electrophile and nucleophile generated in solution, as revealed by extensive DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Dissipative Dynamic Covalent Chemistry (DDCvC) Based on the Transimination Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report that the composition of a dynamic library (DL) of interconverting imines can be controlled over the time in a dissipative fashion by the addition of an activated carboxylic acid used as a chemical fuel. When the fuel is added to the DL, which is initially under thermodynamic equilibrium, the composition of the mixture dramatically changes and a new, dissipative (out of equilibrium) state is reached that persists until fuel exhaustion. Thus, a transient dissipative dynamic library (DDL) is generated that, eventually, reverts back to the initial DL when the fuel is consumed, closing a DL&#8594;DDL&#8594;DL cycle. The larger the amount of added fuel, the longer the time spent by the system in the DDL state. The transimination reaction is shown to be an optimal candidate for the realization of a dissipative dynamic covalent chemistry (DDCvC).</dc:description>

         <title>Coordination and Hydroboration of Ru(II)&#8208;Borate Complexes: Dihydridoborate vs. Bis(dihydridoborate)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New 18&#8208;electron pseudo&#8208;octahedral Ru&#8208;dihydridoborate and bis(dihydridoborate) complexes have been synthesized and structurally characterised. Isolation of Ru&#8208;bis(dihydridoborate) complexes permitted hydroboration reactions with [HC&#8801;C(CO2Me)] that unusually led to the formation of &#951;4&#8208;&#963;,&#960;&#8208;alkene&#8208;borane complexes via both Markovnikov and anti&#8208;Markovnikov additions.







Abstract
Treatment of [Cp*RuCl2]2, 1, [(COD)IrCl]2, 2 or [(p&#8208;cymene)RuCl2]2, 3 (Cp*=&#951;5&#8208;C5Me5, COD= 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene and p&#8208;cymene=&#951;6&#8208;iPrC6H4Me) with heterocyclic borate ligands [Na[(H3B)L], L1 and L2 (L1: L=amt, L2: L=mp; amt=2&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1,3,4&#8208;thiadiazole, mp=2&#8208;mercaptopyridine) led to the formation of borate complexes having uncommon coordination. For example, complexes 1 and 2 on reaction with L1 and L2 afforded dihydridoborate species [LAM(&#956;&#8208;H)2BHL] 4&#8211;6 (4: LA=Cp*, M=Ru, L=amt; 5: LA=Cp*, M=Ru, L=mp; 6: LA=COD, M=Ir, L=mp). On the other hand, treatment of 3 with L2 yielded cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;bis(dihydridoborate) species, [Ru{(&#956;&#8208;H)2BH(mp)}2], cis&#8208;7 and trans&#8208;7. The isolation and structural characterization of fac&#8208; and mer&#8208;[Ru{(&#956;&#8208;H)2BH(mp)}{(&#956;&#8208;H)BH(mp)2}], 8 from the same reaction offered an insight into the behaviour of these dihydridoborate species in solution. Fascinatingly, despite having reduced natural charges on Ru centres both at cis&#8208;and trans&#8208;7, they underwent hydroboration reaction with alkynes that yielded both Markovnikov and anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition products, 10&#8201;a&#8211;d.

&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

On the other hand, treatment of &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; with &lt;b&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; yielded &lt;i&gt;cis-&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;trans-&lt;/i&gt;bis(dihydridoborate) species, [Ru{(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;-H)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BH(mp)}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;], &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;.

Fascinatingly, despite having reduced natural charges on Ru centres both at &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-and &lt;i&gt;trans-&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;, they underwent hydroboration reaction with alkynes that yielded both Markovnikov and anti-Markovnikov addition products, &lt;b&gt;10&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;d&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlling the Dual&#8208;Emission Character of Aryl&#8208;Modified o&#8208;Carboranes by Intramolecular CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O Interaction Sites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual&#8208;emission character of aryl&#8208;modified o&#8208;carboranes can be regulated by intramolecular CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interactions. Stronger interactions can afford a higher LE/ICT (LE: locally excited, ICT: intramolecular charge transfer) ratio because of the tightly locked molecular orientation favorable for LE emission. Well&#8208;balanced LE/ICT dual emission could be achieved by tuning intramolecular interaction sites in the solid state. The more activated molecular motions at higher temperature gradually perturbed LE/ICT ratio, resulting in the thermoresponsivity in solid.







Abstract
It is still challenging to realize a dual&#8208;emission system, in which two luminescent bands simultaneously appear by photoexcitation, in solid with organic dyes due to the difficulty in regulation of electronic properties in the excited state and concentration quenching. o&#8208;Carborane is known to be a versatile platform for constructing solid&#8208;state emitters since the sphere boron cluster is favorable for suppressing intermolecular interactions and subsequently concentration quenching. Here, we show solid&#8208;state dual&#8208;emissive o&#8208;carborane derivatives. We prepared 4 types of o&#8208;carborane derivatives and found dual&#8208;emission behaviors both in solution and solid states. By regulating the rotation at the o&#8208;carborane unit with the intramolecular CcageH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interaction, the dual&#8208;emission intensity ratios were changed. Finally, it was demonstrated that the overall photoluminescence spectra can be estimated using the binding energy of intramolecular interactions.

         <title>Versatile Near&#8208;Infrared Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging of Amyloid Fibrils with the Fluorogenic Probe CRANAD&#8208;2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We test the performance of CRANAD&#8208;2 in stimulated emission depletion (STED) and single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM), two super&#8208;resolution techniques with typically divergent fluorophore requirements. By conveniently adapting the concentration of CRANAD&#8208;2, which transiently binds to amyloid fibrils, we show that it performs well in both techniques, achieving a resolution in the range of 45&#8211;55&#8197;nm.







Abstract
CRANAD&#8208;2 is a fluorogenic curcumin derivative used for near&#8208;infrared detection and imaging in vivo of amyloid aggregates, which are involved in neurodegenerative diseases. We explore the performance of CRANAD&#8208;2 in two super&#8208;resolution imaging techniques, namely stimulated emission depletion (STED) and single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM), with markedly different fluorophore requirements. By conveniently adapting the concentration of CRANAD&#8208;2, which transiently binds to amyloid fibrils, we show that it performs well in both techniques, achieving a resolution in the range of 45&#8211;55&#8197;nm. Correlation of SMLM with atomic force microscopy (AFM) validates the resolution of fine features in the reconstructed super&#8208;resolved image. The good performance and versatility of CRANAD&#8208;2 provides a powerful tool for near&#8208;infrared nanoscopic imaging of amyloids in vitro and in vivo.

         <title>In Vitro Anticancer Ability of Nano Fluorescent 111In&#8208;MIL&#8208;68/PEG&#8208;FA on Hela Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
A new type of nano fluorescent 111In&#8208;MOF with built&#8208;in Auger electron emitter (111In) is elaborately designed. The in&#8197;vitro evaluations demonstrate that the obtained radioactive nanomedicine can specifically target Hela cells, and effectively inhibit the growth of cancer cells. Furthermore, the cell cycle distribution showed a dose&#8208;dependent G2/M arrest mode, also indicating that the obtained 111In&#8208;MOF is able to promote the cells to enter apoptotic program.







Abstract
In past decades, nanoscale metal&#8208;organic frameworks (NMOFs) have drawn more and more attention in multimodal imaging and targeting therapy of various malignant cancers. Here, we proposed to dope 111In into fluorescent In&#8208;based NMOFs (In&#8208;MIL&#8208;68&#8208;NH2), with an attempt to prepare a new nanomedicine with great anticancer potential. As a proof of concept, the obtained NMOF (In&#8208;MIL&#8208;68/PEG&#8208;FA) with targeting motifs is able to act as a fluorescent probe to achieve Hela cell imaging. Moreover, the Auger electron emitter 111In built in corresponding radioactive NMOF (111In&#8208;MIL&#8208;68/PEG&#8208;FA) can bring clear damage to cancer cells, leading to a high cell killing rate of 59.3&#8201;% within 48&#8197;h. In addition, the cell cycle presented a significant dose&#8208;dependent G2/M inhibiting mode, which indicates that 111In&#8208;MIL&#8208;68/PEG&#8208;FA has the ability to facilitate the cancer cells to enter apoptotic program. This work demonstrated the potential of 111In&#8208;labelled NMOFs in specific killings of cancer cells, providing a new approach to develop nanomedicines with theranostic function.

         <title>Nitrogen Donor Protection for Atomically Precise Metal Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beyond the conventional thiolate, phosphine and alkynyl ligands, nitrogen donor ligands have recently emerged as protecting agents for well&#8208;defined metal nanoclusters. Given the terminal coordination preference of the negatively charged amido and amidinate ligands with multidentate donors, interesting structural and functional features are observed for metal nanoclusters protected by these types of N donor ligands.







Abstract
Surface organic ligands are critical in dictating the structures and properties of atomically precise metal nanoclusters. In contrast to the conventionally used thiolate, phosphine and alkynyl ligands, nitrogen donor ligands have not been used in the protection for well&#8208;defined metal nanoclusters until recently. This review focuses on recent developments in atomically precise metal nanoclusters stabilized by different types of nitrogen donor ligands, in which the synthesis, total structure determination and various properties are covered. We hope that this review will provide insights into the rational design of N donor&#8208;protected metal nanoclusters in terms of structural and functional modulation.

Given the terminal coordination preference of the negatively charged amido and amidinate ligands with multidentate donors, interesting structural and functional features are observed for metal nanoclusters protected by these types of N donor ligands.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surface organic ligands are critical in dictating the structures and properties of atomically precise metal nanoclusters. In contrast to the conventionally used thiolate, phosphine and alkynyl ligands, nitrogen donor ligands have not been used in the protection for well-defined metal nanoclusters until recently. This review focuses on recent developments in atomically precise metal nanoclusters stabilized by different types of nitrogen donor ligands, in which the synthesis, total structure determination and various properties are covered. We hope that this review will provide insights into the rational design of N donor-protected metal nanoclusters in terms of structural and functional modulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Unified Mechanism for the PhCOCOOH&#8208;mediated Photochemical Reactions: Revisiting its Action and Comparison to Known Photoinitiators</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemistry: Since 2014, we have introduced in literature the use of phenylglyoxylic acid (PhCOCOOH), a small and commercially available organic molecule, as a potent promoter in a variety of photochemical processes. Although PhCOCOOH has a broad scope of photochemical reactions that can promote, the understanding of its mode of action in our early contributions was moderate. Herein, a thorough study led to a unified and revisited reaction mechanism for the PhCOCOOH&#8208;mediated reactions. A comparison to known photoinitiators was also performed.







Abstract
Since 2014, we have introduced in literature the use of phenylglyoxylic acid (PhCOCOOH), a small and commercially available organic molecule, as a potent promoter in a variety of photochemical processes. Although PhCOCOOH has a broad scope of photochemical reactions that can promote, the understanding of its mode of action in our early contributions was moderate. Herein, we are restudying and revisiting the mechanism of action of PhCOCOOH in most of these early contributions, providing a unified mechanism of action. Furthermore, the understanding of its action as a photoinitiator opened a new comparison study with known and commercially available photoinitiators.

         <title>Explorations of New SHG Materials in Mercury Iodate Sulfate System**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Winning combo: By combining Hg2+ with strong polarizability, iodate with asymmetric configuration, and sulfate with large band gap, Hg2(IO3)2(SO4)(H2O) with a strong second&#8208;harmonic generation signal and short ultraviolet absorption edge was obtained. It crystallizes in the polar space group C2 and features 3D framework composed of [Hg(IO3)]+ cationic layers and SO42&#8722; anions through Hg&#8722;O&#8722;S linkages. The transformation between Hg2(IO3)2(SO4)(H2O) and Hg2(IO3)2(SO4) is also very interesting. (In the graphic, KDP=KH2PO4)







Abstract
Through systematic experiments, two novel mercury iodate sulfates, namely, Hg2(IO3)2(SO4)(H2O) and Hg2(IO3)2(SO4) were obtained. They crystallize in monoclinic space group C2 and C2/c, respectively. Hg2(IO3)2(SO4)(H2O) exhibits the [Hg(IO3)]+ polar cationic layer inherited from Hg(IO3)2 and the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) framework inherited from HgSO4. This enables Hg2(IO3)2(SO4)(H2O) to generate a strong second harmonic generation (SHG) response of 6 times that of KH2PO4 (KDP). The structure of Hg2(IO3)2(SO4) is very similar to that of Hg2(IO3)2(SO4)(H2O), and they can be transformed into each other. Hg2(IO3)2(SO4)(H2O) shows a large optical band gap of 3.98&#8197;eV and a high dehydration temperature of 250&#8201;&#176;C. This study indicates that by reasonable design, the introduction of multiple functional groups into a compound may combine their advantages to achieve good overall optical performance.

         <title>Large Enhancement of Single Molecular Conductance of Molecular Wire by a Radical Substituent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A comparison of single molecular conductance between two &#960;&#8208;conjugated wires with and without radical substituent was performed. Specifically, methyl&#8208; and iminonitroxide&#8208;substituted 4&#8208;(biphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;yl)pyridine wires bound onto porphyrin template were subjected to scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) apparent height measurement at the interface between highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) and 1&#8208;octanoic acid. Statistical analysis of STM images revealed that the radical&#8208;substituted wire has 3.2&#177;1.7 times larger conductance than the methyl&#8208;substituted reference. Although density functional theory (DFT) calculation suggests that only 17% of the SOMO is distributed on the wire moiety, the effect was significant. This study presents the potential of radical substituents to achieve the high conductivity of molecular wires.</dc:description>

Specifically, methyl- and iminonitroxide-substituted 4-(biphenyl-4-yl)pyridine wires bound onto porphyrin template were subjected to scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) apparent height measurement at the interface between highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) and 1-octanoic acid. Statistical analysis of STM images revealed that the radical-substituted wire has 3.2&#177;1.7 times larger conductance than the methyl-substituted reference. Although density functional theory (DFT) calculation suggests that only 17% of the SOMO is distributed on the wire moiety, the effect was significant. This study presents the potential of radical substituents to achieve the high conductivity of molecular wires.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Kinetics&#8208;Based Approach to Developing Electrocatalytic Variants of Slow Oxidations: Application to Hydride Abstraction&#8208;Initiated Cyclization Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical oxidant regeneration is challenging in reactions that have a slow redox step because the steady state concentration of the reduced oxidant is low, causing difficulties in maintaining sufficient current or preventing potential spikes. This manuscript shows that applying an understanding of the relationship between intermediate cation stability, oxidant strength, overpotential, and concentration on reaction kinetics delivers a method for electrochemical oxoammonium ion regeneration in hydride abstraction&#8208;initiated cyclization reactions, resulting in the development of an electrocatalytic variant of a process that has a high oxidation transition state free energy. This approach should be applicable to expanding the scope of electrocatalysis to include additional slow redox processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescent Thin Films Enabled by CsPbX3 (X=Cl, Br, I) Precursor Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inorganic cesium lead halide perovskite nanocrystals are candidates for lighting and display materials due to their outstanding optoelectronic properties. However, the dissolution issue of perovskite nanocrystals in polar solvents remains a challenge for practical applications. Herein, we present a newly&#8208;designed one&#8208;step spin&#8208;coating strategy to prepare a novel multicolor&#8208;tunable CsPbX3  (X=Cl, Br, I) nanocrystal film, where the CsPbX3  precursor solution was formed by dissolving PbO, Cs2CO3,  and CH3NH3X into the ionic liquid n&#8208;butylammonium butyrate. The as&#8208;designed CsPbX3  nanocrystal films show high color purity with a narrow emission width. Also, the blue CsPb(Cl/Br)3  film demonstrates the absolute photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) of 15.6%, which is higher than 11.7% of green CsPbBr3  and 8.3% of red CsPb(Br/I)3  film. This study develops an effective approach to preparing CsPbX3  nanocrystal thin films, opening a new avenue to design perovskite nanocrystals&#8208;based devices for lighting and display applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Single crystals of mixed&#8208;cation copper&#8208;based perovskite with trimodal bandgap behavior</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional hybrid perovskites, with their novel functionalities and structural diversity, are a perfect platform for emerging optoelectronic devices such as photodetectors, lightemitting diodes, and solar cells. For the first time, we studied the synthesis and characterization of mixed&#8208;cation copper perovskite crystals including (Cs, caesium/MA, methyl ammonium). Interestingly, unlike mixed&#8208;cation lead perovskites, which demonstrate bimodal band gap behavior, mixed&#8208;cation copper perovskites demonstrate trimodal band gap behavior, as proven by X&#8208;Ray Diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. In comparison to all Cs perovskite, which has antiferromagnetic properties, all MA and mixed&#8208;cation perovskites demonstrate ferromagnetic behavior. According to optical measurements, mixed&#8208;cation perovskite has the lowest band gap (1.53 eV) of all MA and all Cs perovskites. In comparison to all MA and all Cs perovskites, the mixed&#8208;cation perovskite solar cell exhibits the lowest Voc losses. These findings demonstrate the importance of cation&#8208;engineering in developing innovative materials with novel properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the biosynthetic capacity of TsrM, a B12&#8208;dependent Radical SAM Enzyme Catalyzing Non&#8208;radical Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>B12&#8208;dependent radical SAM enzymes are an emerging enzyme family with approximately 200,000 proteins. These enzymes have been shown to catalyze chemically challenging reactions such as methyl transfer to  sp2  &#8208; and  sp3  &#8208;hybridized carbon atoms. However, to date we have little information regarding their complex mechanisms and their biosynthetic potential. Here we show, using X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, mutagenesis and synthetic probes that the vitamin B12&#8208;dependent radical SAM enzyme TsrM catalyzes not only C&#8208; but also N&#8208;methyl transfer reactions further expanding its synthetic versatility. We also demonstrate that TsrM has the unique ability to directly transfer a methyl group to the benzyl core of tryptophan, including the least reactive position C4. Collectively, our study supports that TsrM catalyzes non&#8208;radical reactions and establishes the usefulness of radical SAM enzymes for novel biosynthetic schemes including serial alkylation reactions at particularly inert C&#8208;H bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Complexes of Singly, Doubly and Triply Linked Porphyrins and Corroles: An Insight into the Physicochemical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal complexes of directly linked metalloporphyrine and corrole oligomers have been extensively studied due to their intriguing optical and electronic properties. In this regard, the impact of the different type of direct linkages on electrochemical, magnetic, electronic and electrocatalytic properties of various metallopophyrine and corrole oligomers have been discussed at length in this Review article.







Abstract
Metal complexes of multi&#8208;porphyrins and multi&#8208;corroles are unique systems that display a host of extremely interesting properties. Availability of free meso and &#946; positions allow formation of different types of directly linked bis&#8208;porphyrins giving rise to intriguing optical and electronic properties. While the fields of metalloporphyrin and corroles monomer have seen exponential growth in the last decades, the chemistry of metal complexes of bis&#8208;porphyrins and bis&#8208;corroles remain rather underexplored. Therefore, the impact of covalent linkages on the optical, electronic, (spectro)electrochemical, magnetic and electrocatalytic activities of metal complexes of bis&#8208;porphyrins and &#8208;corroles has been summarized in this review article. This article shows that despite the (still) somewhat difficult synthetic access to these molecules, their extremely exciting properties do make a strong case for pursuing research on these classes of compounds.

         <dc:description>The synthesis and characterization of a homologous series of quinoid sulfur&#8208;containing imidazolyl&#8208;substituted heteroacenes is described. The optoelectronic and magnetic properties were investigated by UV/vis, fluorescence and EPR spectroscopy as well as quantum chemical calculations and were compared to the corresponding benzo congener. The room&#8208;temperature and atmosphere&#8208;stable quinoids display strong absorption in the NIR region between 678&#8211;819 nm. The dithieno[3,2&#8208;  b  :2',3'&#8208;  d  ]thiophene derivative and the thieno[2',3':4,5]thieno[3,2&#8208;  b  ]thieno[2,3&#8208;  d  ]thiophene derivative were EPR active at room temperature. For the latter, variable temperature EPR spectroscopy revealed the presence of a thermally accessible triplet state, with a singlettriplet separation of 14.1 kJ/mol.</dc:description>

         <title>Formation and photoinduced electron transfer in porphyrin&#8208; and phthalocyanine&#8208; bearing N&#8208;doped graphene hybrids synthesized via click chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Graphene doped with heteroatoms such as nitrogen, boron, and phosphorous by replacing some of the skeletal carbon atoms is emerging as an important class of two&#8208;dimensional materials as it offers the much&#8208;needed bandgap for optoelectronic applications and provides better access for chemical functionalization at the hetero&#8208;atom sites. Covalent grafting of photosensitizers onto such doped graphenes makes them highly useful for light&#8208;induced applications.&#160; Herein, we report the covalent functionalization of N&#8208;doped graphene (NG) with two well&#8208;known electron donor photosensitizers, namely, zinc porphyrin (ZnP) and zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc), using the simple  click  chemistry approach.  Covalent attachment of ZnP and ZnPc at the N&#8208;sites of NG in NG&#8208;ZnP and NG&#8208;ZnPc hybrids was confirmed using a range of spectroscopic, thermogravimetric, and imaging techniques.  Ground and excited&#8208;state interactions in  NG&#8208;ZnP and NG&#8208;ZnPc were  monitored using spectral and electrochemical techniques. Efficient quenching of photosensitizer fluorescence in these hybrids was observed, and the relatively easier oxidations of ZnP and ZnPc supported excited&#8208;state charge&#8208;separation events. Photoinduced charge separation in NG&#8208;ZnP and NG&#8208;ZnPc hybrids was confirmed using the ultrafast pump&#8208;probe technique. The measured rate constants were of the order of 10  10  s,  &#8208;1  thus indicating ultrafast electron transfer phenomena.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;performance heterogeneous thermocatalysis caused by catalyst wettability regulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalyst wettability regulation has emerged as an attractive approach for high catalytic performance for the past few years. By introducing appropriate wettability, the molecule diffusion of reactants and products can be enhanced, leading to high activity. Besides, undesired molecules are isolated for high selectivity of target products and long&#8208;term stability of catalyst. Herein, we summarize wettability induced high&#8208;performance heterogeneous thermocatalysis in recent years, including hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity, hybrid hydrophilicity&#8208;hydrophobicity, amphiphilicity, and superaerophilicity. Relevant reactions are further classified and described according to the reason for the performance improvement. It should be pointed out that studies of utilizing superaerophilicity to improve heterogeneous thermocatalytic performance have been included for the first time, so this is a comparatively comprehensive review in this field as yet.</dc:description>

         <title>Planar Chiral Rhodium Complexes of 1,4&#8208;Benzoquinones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral rhodium complexes are widely used in asymmetric catalysis. Herein we describe a new approach to such chiral complexes featuring the intrinsically achiral benzoquinone ligands. The synthesis was achieved by the face&#8208;selective coordination of 2,5&#8208;substituted benzoquinones with rhodium bearing the readily available oxazoline&#8208;phenolate ligand. This chiral auxiliary ligand was subsequently replaced with retention of the planar chirality of (diene)Rh fragment. The selectivity of metal coordination was quantitatively predicted by DFT calculations before the actual synthesis.







Abstract
Diene rhodium complexes are important catalysts in modern organic synthesis. Herein, we report a new approach to such complexes with the uncommon planar chirality. The synthesis is achieved by face&#8208;selective coordination of the prochiral 2,5&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinones (R2&#8208;Q) with rhodium precursors containing the chiral auxiliary ligand S&#8208;salicyl&#8208;oxazoline (S&#8208;Salox). Such coordination leads to the formation of (R,R&#8208;R2&#8208;Q)Rh(S&#8208;Salox) complexes in high yields and with exceptional diastereoselectivity (d.&#8201;r.&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1). Subsequent replacement of the auxiliary ligand provides various benzoquinone rhodium complexes with retention of the planar chirality. Combined theoretical and experimental studies show that due to their electron&#8208;withdrawing nature benzoquinones bind metals stronger than the related 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene, but weaker than other common diene ligands, such as cyclooctadiene.

         <title>Evidence of Kinetically Relevant Consistency in Thermal and Photo&#8208;Thermal HCOOH Decomposition over Pd/LaCrO3/C3N4 Composite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photo&#8208;energy and thermal&#8208;energy in a synergetic way promote catalytic reaction together. In this article, the C&#8722;H bond rupture within HCOOH* was determined to be the rate&#8208;determining step with adsorbed CO* as the most abundant surface intermediates (MASIs) under both thermal and photo&#8208;thermal reaction conditions confirmed by kinetic isotopic effects and in situ FTIR characterizations. Clear evidence of kinetically relevant consistency was determined under both thermal and photo&#8208;thermal HCOOH decomposition reactions over Pd/LaCrO3/C3N4 composite.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;thermal catalysis has been an attractive alternative strategy to promote chemical reactions for years, however, how light cooperates with thermal energy is still unclear. We meet this demand by exploring reaction mechanism via pressure dependency studies as well as H/D exchange experiments with HCOOH decomposition as a probe over a palladium nanoparticle (Pdn) and isolated Pd (Pd1) decorated LaCrO3/C3N4 composite catalyst, in which the H2 formation rate shows a first&#8208;order dependence on HCOOH and inverse first&#8208;order dependence on CO partial pressures no matter the reaction was driven by thermal or photo&#8208;thermal energy. Additionally, negligible kinetic isotopic effects (KIEs: kH/kD) were determined under both dark and light conditions at 1.04 and 1.18 when the HCOOH was replaced by HCOOD. Besides, when the reactant HCOOH was further replaced by DCOOD, the KIE values of 1.55 (dark) and 1.92 (light) were obtained, which indicates that the HCOOH decomposition follows kinetically relevant (KR) of C&#8722;H bond rupture within HCOOH molecule under both thermal and photo&#8208;thermal reaction conditions and the catalytic surface was found to be densely covered by CO based on the pressure dependency studies as well as the in&#8197;situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis. Clearly, the HCOOH decomposition driven by thermal and photo&#8208;thermal energy follows the same reaction mechanism. Nevertheless, light induced hot electrons and the derived thermal effect do cause the enhancement of the reaction activity in some circumstances compared with bare thermal catalysis, which clarifies the confusion on cooperation mechanism of photo and thermal energies from the kinetic perspective. Hot electrons induced by photo&#8208;illumination was confirmed by in&#8197;situ FTIR CO chemisorption with &#8764;10&#8197;cm&#8722;1 redshift identified of the CO feature once light was introduced. Meanwhile, the photo thermal reaction system suffers from severe electron&#8208;hole re&#8208;combination at high reaction temperatures and make the thermal effect of photo irradiation dominant with respect to the effect at low reaction temperatures. This research provides insight to the mechanism on how photo&#8208;thermal reaction works and draws attention to the photo&#8208;thermal reaction process in boosting catalytic activity.

         <title>Vinylcyclopropane [3+2] Cycloaddition with Acetylenic Sulfones Based on Visible Light Photocatalysis**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new visible light&#8208;mediated intermolecular [3+2] cycloaddition reaction of meta photocycloadducts with acetylenic sulfones catalyzed by iridium complexes has been developed. The strain energy contained in the photogenerated vinylcyclopropane system enables efficient access to a new complex molecular scaffold under very mild conditions. DFT&#8208;calculations and time&#8208;resolved optical spectroscopy studies substantiated a triplet energy transfer mechanism.







Abstract
The first intermolecular visible light [3+2] cycloaddition reaction performed on a meta photocycloadduct employing acetylenic sulfones is described. The developed methodology exploits the advantages of combining UV and visible&#8208;light in a two&#8208;step sequence that provides a photogenerated cyclopropane which, through a strain&#8208;release process, generates a new cyclopentane ring while significantly increasing the molecular complexity. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations indicate an energy transfer pathway for the visible light&#8208;driven reaction step. This strategy could be extended to simpler vinylcyclopropanes.

     alt="Vinylcyclopropane [3+2] Cycloaddition with Acetylenic Sulfones Based on Visible Light Photocatalysis**&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A new visible light-mediated intermolecular&lt;/b&gt; [3+2] cycloaddition reaction of &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt; photocycloadducts with acetylenic sulfones catalyzed by iridium complexes has been developed. The strain energy contained in the photogenerated vinylcyclopropane system enables efficient access to a new complex molecular scaffold under very mild conditions. DFT-calculations and time-resolved optical spectroscopy studies substantiated a triplet energy transfer mechanism.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first intermolecular visible light [3+2] cycloaddition reaction performed on a &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt; photocycloadduct employing acetylenic sulfones is described. The developed methodology exploits the advantages of combining UV and visible-light in a two-step sequence that provides a photogenerated cyclopropane which, through a strain-release process, generates a new cyclopentane ring while significantly increasing the molecular complexity. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations indicate an energy transfer pathway for the visible light-driven reaction step. This strategy could be extended to simpler vinylcyclopropanes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Highly Stable Yttrium Organic Framework as a Host for Optical Thermometry and D2O Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrothermally stable and thermally robust yttrium MOF can be substituted with photoluminescent lanthanide ions to act as a ratiometric luminescent thermometer. Accurate temperature determination is possible up to at least 573&#8197;K, the highest of any MOF reported to date. Monitoring of the luminescent decay lifetime allows detection of D2O in water with a sensitivity suited for practical applications.







Abstract
The yttrium organic framework (Y0.89Tb0.10Eu0.01)6(BDC)7(OH)4(H2O)4 (BDC=benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylate) is hydrothermally stable up to at least 513&#8197;K and thermally stable in air in excess of 673&#8197;K. The relative intensities of luminescence of Tb3+ and Eu3+ are governed by Tb3+&#8208;to&#8208;Eu3+ phonon&#8208;assisted energy transfer and Tb3+&#8208;to&#8208;ligand back transfer and are responsible for the differing temperature&#8208;dependent luminescence of the two ions. This provides a ratiometric luminescent thermometer in the 288&#8211;573&#8197;K temperature range, not previously seen for MOF materials, with a high sensitivity, 1.69&#177;0.04&#8201;%&#8201;K&#8722;1 at 523&#8197;K. In aqueous conditions, loosely bound H2O can be replaced by D2O in the same material, which modifies decay lifetimes to yield a quantitative luminescent D2O sensor with a useful sensitivity for practical application.

         <title>Effect of gem&#8208;Difluorination on the Key Physicochemical Properties Relevant to Medicinal Chemistry: The Case of Functionalized Cycloalkanes</title>

         <dc:description>
Fearless Fluorine: the effect of gem&#8208;diflurination on acidity/basicity (pKa), lipophilicity (LogP), aqueous solubility (Sw), and metabolic stability (intrinsic clearance, CLint) of functionalized C3&#8722;C7&#8208;cycloalkanes is established and compared to those of non&#8208;fluorinated and acyclic counterparts. While the pKa values are varied similarly for the cyclic and acyclic series and can be explained by the inductive effect of the fluorine atoms, the LogP and Sw trends are more complex. The CLint values are retained or slightly improved upon gem&#8208;difluorination.







Abstract
Physico&#8208;chemical properties important to drug discovery (pKa, LogP, and aqueous solubility), as well as metabolic stability, were studied for a series of functionalized gem&#8208;difluorinated cycloalkanes and compared to those of non&#8208;fluorinated and acyclic counterparts to evaluate the impact of the fluorination. It was found that the influence of the CF2 moiety on the acidity/basicity of the corresponding carboxylic acids and amines was defined by inductive the effect of the fluorine atoms and was nearly the same for acyclic and cyclic aliphatic compounds. Lipophilicity and aqueous solubility followed more complex trends and were affected by the position of the fluorine atoms, ring size, and even the nature of the functional group present; also, significant differences were found for the acyclic and cyclic series. Also, gem&#8208;difluorination either did not affect or slightly improved the metabolic stability of the corresponding model derivatives. The presented results can be used as a guide for rational drug design employing fluorine and establish the first chapter in a catalog of the key in vitro properties of fluorinated cycloalkanes.

         <title>Development of Strong Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Absorbing Cyclometalated Iridium(III) Complexes for Robust and Efficient Light&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Intense and broadband UV&#8208;Vis absorption do matters in iridium(III)&#8208;based photosensitizers for photocatalytic hydrogen generation. This study reveals the importance of choosing an appropriate electron donor on the C^N ligands to improve the performance. The use of triphenylamine&#8208;based Ir(III) PSs shows great potential in boosting the photocatalytic performance.







Abstract
Weak light absorption of common Ir(III) complexes (e.&#8201;g., using phenylpyridine as the ligand) has hindered their applications in photocatalytic hydrogen generation from water as an efficient photosensitizer. To address this issue, a series of cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes (Ir1&#8211;Ir5), featuring different electron&#8208;donating substituents to enhance the absorptivity, have been synthesized and studied as photosensitizers (PSs) for light&#8208;driven hydrogen production from water. Ir6&#8211;Ir7 were prepared as fundamental systems for comparisons. Electron donors, including 9&#8208;phenylcarbazole, triphenylamine, 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dimethoxytriphenylamine, 4,4&#8242;&#8208;di(N&#8208;hexylcarbazole)triphenylamine moieties were introduced on 6&#8208;(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenanthridine&#8208;based cyclometalating (C^N) ligands to explore the donor effect on the hydrogen evolution performance of these cationic Ir(III) complexes. Remarkably, Ir4 with 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dimethoxytriphenylamine achieved the highest turn&#8208;over number (TON) of 12&#8201;300 and initial turnover frequency (TOFi) of 394&#8197;h&#8722;1, with initial activity (activityi) of 547&#8201;000&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and initial apparent quantum yield (AQYi) of 9.59&#8201;%, under the illumination of blue light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) for 105&#8197;hours, which demonstrated a stable three&#8208;component photocatalytic system with high efficiency. The TON (based on n(H2)/n(PSr)) in this study is the highest value reported to date among the similar photocatalytic systems using Ir(III) complexes with Pt nanoparticles as catalyst. The great potential of using triphenylamine&#8208;based Ir(III) PSs in boosting photocatalytic performance has also been shown.

         <title>Hollow Capsule NiCo2NS Prepared by Self&#8208;Sacrificing Template Method for High&#8208;Efficiency Bifunctional Catalyst and Its Application in Zn&#8208;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiCo2NS with a hollow capsule structure was obtained through a self&#8208;sacrificing template method. NiCo2NS exhibited excellent performance in terms of ORR and OER. It shows an overpotential of 154&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.76&#8197;V. The Zn&#8208;air batteries based on NiCo2NS showed excellent cycle stability and small voltage gap. It exhibited a specific capacity of 693&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and kept stable during 1200 charge/discharge cycles.







Abstract
Exploring the application of high&#8208;efficiency bifunctional oxygen catalysts to rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries has been a research hotspot in recent years. We succeeded in obtaining NiCo2NS with a hollow capsule structure through the self&#8208;sacrificing template method, which has a larger specific surface area and can provide more active sites for electrocatalysis relative to his solid. The introduction of S can change the valence distribution of N and the electronic structure of the M&#8722;N bond, so that NiCo2NS exhibits excellent performance in the overpotential and stability of the oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions. It shows an overpotential of 154&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.76&#8197;V. When used as a bi&#8208;functional catalyst in zinc&#8208;air batteries, it exhibits good stability within 400&#8197;h. The flexible battery assembled by NiCo2NS also shows excellent performance, and can be cycled stably for 20&#8197;h. The current maintains good stability when it is bent at different angles during the cycle.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NiCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NS with a hollow capsule structure&lt;/b&gt; was obtained through a self-sacrificing template method. NiCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NS exhibited excellent performance in terms of ORR and OER. It shows an overpotential of 154&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a half-wave potential of 0.76&#8197;V. The Zn-air batteries based on NiCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NS showed excellent cycle stability and small voltage gap. It exhibited a specific capacity of 693&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and kept stable during 1200 charge/discharge cycles.

&lt;p&gt;Exploring the application of high-efficiency bifunctional oxygen catalysts to rechargeable zinc-air batteries has been a research hotspot in recent years. We succeeded in obtaining NiCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NS with a hollow capsule structure through the self-sacrificing template method, which has a larger specific surface area and can provide more active sites for electrocatalysis relative to his solid. The introduction of S can change the valence distribution of N and the electronic structure of the M&#8722;N bond, so that NiCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NS exhibits excellent performance in the overpotential and stability of the oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions.

         <title>Skeletal Transformation Triggered by C&#8722;F Bond Activation after Photochemical Rearrangement of Fluorinated [7]Helicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The skeletal transformation of tetrafluorinated [7]helicene continued after a photochemical double fluorine atom transfer. On silica gel, the photoproduct underwent Wagner&#8211;Meerwein rearrangement followed by nucleophilic aromatic substitution. This sequential transformation resulted in elimination of two fluorine atoms, affording a difluorinated carbonyl compound. Hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol enabled the same transformation and served as a nucleophile.







Abstract
Tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;fluorinated [7]helicenes are photolabile and undergo a double fluorine atom transfer. Herein, we show that the transferred product further undergoes a skeletal transformation on silica gel. The transformation begins with activation of the allylic C&#8722;F bond on the silanol surface. Then, the resulting carbocation readily undergoes a regioselective nucleophilic aromatic substitution with water, depending on the position of the fluorine substituents. Hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol also activated the allylic C&#8722;F bond and acted as a nucleophile. These findings support the generation of a highly reactive cationic electrophilic intermediate in the successive transformations involving fluorine atoms.

         <title>Catalytic Oxidation of Veratryl Alcohol Derivatives Using RuCo/rGO Composites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Composites of RuCo alloy nanoparticles and reduced graphene oxide (RuCo/rGO) with Ru to Co ratios of 1&#8201;:&#8201;0 to 1.2&#8201;:&#8201;1, can catalyzed effectively C&#945;&#8722;OH in lignin model compounds using O2 as oxidant at 100&#8201;&#176;C for 2&#8197;h, owing to the combination of the intrinsic catalytic activity of Ru, the unique flower&#8208;shaped morphology of RuCo alloy nanoparticles.







Abstract
Chemoselectively oxidizing C&#945;&#8722;OH to C=O has been considered as a key step for the oxidative depolymerization of lignin. In this work, we design and prepare a series of composites of RuCo alloy nanoparticles and reduced graphene oxide (RuCo/rGO) with different Ru to Co ratios and explore their catalytic activities in the oxidation of veratryl alcohol derivatives, which usually serve as the model compounds for studying lignin oxidation. It is illustrated that the Ru to Co ratio determines the morphology and average size of the RuCo alloy nanoparticles on rGO, and the overall catalytic activities of the composites. The RuCo alloy nanoparticles on rGO with Ru to Co ratios of 1&#8201;:&#8201;0 to 1.2&#8201;:&#8201;1 show a unique flower&#8208;shaped morphology that increases the exposure of the active sites and thus promotes their contact with the substrates. The RuCo/rGO composites exhibit high catalytic activities for the oxidation of C&#945;&#8722;OH to aldehydes at 100&#8201;&#176;C for 2&#8197;h. Additionally, the Co component affords the RuCo/rGO composites with magnetic properties that make the separation and recovery of the catalyst simple. Given the high catalytic performances and easy recovery, the RuCo/rGO composites would be potentially useful for the depolymerization of lignin.

         <title>An Alternate [2&#215;2] Grid Constructed Around TiO4N2 Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of an alternate [2&#215;2] grid constructed around four TiO4N2 units is described. This chiral architecture is generated from the 2,2&#8208;bipyrimidine ligand and a tetraphenolic strand. The formation of this tetranuclear assembly is driven by CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interactions. In the course of the self&#8208;assembly process, the system is able to select one diimine ligand in the pool of the initial components.







Abstract
The formation of a tetranuclear self&#8208;assembled species constructed around a TiO4N2 motif is reported. This aggregate is generated from Ti(OiPr)4, 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyrimidine (bpym) and a bis&#8208;biphenol strand (L2H4) where two 2,2&#8217;&#8208;biphenol units are connected with a biphenyl spacer. The solid&#8208;state structure of the [Ti4(L2)4(bpym)4] architecture reveals the formation of an unprecedented chiral alternate [2&#215;2] grid. In addition to the structural characterization of the [Ti4(L2)4(bpym)4] architecture, geometry optimisation on various possible isomeric tetrameric assemblies ([2&#215;2] grid, alternate [2&#215;2] grid, circular helicate or cyclic hemihelicate) is performed using DFT calculations. These results confirm the higher stability of the alternate [2&#215;2] grid over the other possible tetranuclear isomers and allow examining the replacement of the bpym ligands by two novel diimine chelates within the tetranuclear assembly (2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine=bipy and 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyrazine=bipyraz). From this initial theoretical investigation, the competition between these three nitrogen ligands in the course of the self&#8208;assembly process is next evaluated. Overall, this investigation shows that the exclusive formation of the alternate [2&#215;2] grid is driven by CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interactions.

         <title>Novel thienyl DPP derivatives functionalized with terminal electron acceptor groups: synthesis, optical properties and OFET performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three novel diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) based small molecules have been synthesized and characterized in terms of their chemical&#8208;physical, electrochemical and electrical properties. All the molecules consist of a central DPP electron acceptor core symmetrically functionalized with donor bi&#8208;thienyl moieties and flanked in the terminal positions by three different auxiliary electron&#8208;acceptor groups. This kind of molecular structure, characterized by an alternation of electron acceptor and donor groups, was purposely designed to provide a significant absorption at the longer wavelengths of the visible spectrum: when analysed as thin films, in fact, the dyes absorb well over 800 nm and exhibit a narrow optical bandgap down to 1.28 eV. A detailed DFT analysis provides useful information on the electronic structure of the dyes and on the features of the main optical transitions. Organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) have been fabricated by depositing the DPP dyes as active layers from solution: the different end&#8208;functionalization of the dyes had an effect on the charge transport properties with two of the dyes acting as n&#8208;type semiconductors (electron mobility up to 4.4&#8729;10  &#8208;2  cm  2  /V&#8729;s) and the third one as a p&#8208;type semiconductor (hole mobility up to 2.3&#8729;10  &#8208;3  cm  2  /V&#8729;s). Interestingly, well&#8208;balanced ambipolar transistors were achieved by blending the most performant n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type dyes with hole and electron mobility in the order of 10  &#8208;3  cm  2  /V&#8729;s</dc:description>

Organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) have been fabricated by depositing the DPP dyes as active layers from solution: the different end-functionalization of the dyes had an effect on the charge transport properties with two of the dyes acting as n-type semiconductors (electron mobility up to 4.4&#8729;10  -2  cm  2  /V&#8729;s) and the third one as a p-type semiconductor (hole mobility up to 2.3&#8729;10  -3  cm  2  /V&#8729;s). Interestingly, well-balanced ambipolar transistors were achieved by blending the most performant n-type and p-type dyes with hole and electron mobility in the order of 10  -3  cm  2  /V&#8729;s&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ene&#8208;Reductase: A Multifaceted Biocatalyst in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ene&#8208;reductases (ERs) are a promising biocatalyst that reduces unsaturated double bonds cooperatively with transition metals, besides they are amiable with other emergent techniques like photoenzymatic, chemoenzymatic, multi&#8208;enzymatic, photoelectrochemical, single reduction chemistry, and radical&#8208;mediated transformations. These techniques will influence the enzymologist and synthetic chemist to explore and expand the intriguing chemistries displayed by ERs for academic and industrial purposes.







Abstract
Biocatalysis integrate microbiologists, enzymologists, and organic chemists to access the repertoire of pharmaceutical and agrochemicals with high chemoselectivity, regioselectivity, and enantioselectivity. The saturation of carbon&#8208;carbon double bonds by biocatalysts challenges the conventional chemical methodology as it bypasses the use of precious metals (in combination with chiral ligands and molecular hydrogen) or organocatalysts. In this line, Ene&#8208;reductases (ERs) from the Old Yellow Enzymes (OYEs) family are found to be a prominent asymmetric biocatalyst that is increasingly used in academia and industries towards unparalleled stereoselective trans&#8208;hydrogenations of activated C=C bonds. ERs gained prominence as they were used as individual catalysts, multi&#8208;enzyme cascades, and in conjugation with chemical reagents (chemoenzymatic approach). Besides, ERs&#8217; participation in the photoelectrochemical and radical&#8208;mediated process helps to unlock many scopes outside traditional biocatalysis. These up&#8208;and&#8208;coming methodologies entice the enzymologists and chemists to explore, expand and harness the chemistries displayed by ERs for industrial settings. Herein, we reviewed the last five year's exploration of organic transformations using ERs.

         <title>Highly Sensitive &#8220;Off/On&#8221; EPR Probes to Monitor Enzymatic Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study are reported two off/on EPR probes containing a nitroxide radical to study the enzymatic activity of carboxylesterases. Thanks to their low solubility in water, they aggregate to form stable micelles, which makes the probes EPR silent. In presence of the esterases enzymes the nitroxide radicals are release from the micelle giving an off/on transition and intense signal.







Abstract
The assessment of unregulated level of enzyme activity is a crucial parameter for early diagnoses in a wide range of pathologies. In this study, we propose the use of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) as an easy method to probe carboxylesterase (CE) enzymatic activity in&#8197;vitro. For this application, were synthesized two amphiphilic, nitroxide containing esters, namely Tempo&#8208;C12 (T&#8208;C12) and Tempo&#8208;2&#8208;C12 (T&#8208;2&#8208;C12). They exhibit low solubility in water and form stable micelles in which the radicals are EPR almost silent, but the hydrolysis of the ester bond yields narrows and intense EPR signals. The intensity of the EPR signals is proportional to the enzymatic activity. CEs1, CEs2 and esterase from porcine liver (PLE) were investigated. The obtained results show that T&#8208;C12 and T&#8208;2&#8208;C12&#8208;containing systems display a much higher selectivity toward the CEs2, with a Limit of Detection of the same order of those ones obtained with optical methods.

         <title>Femtosecond Spectroscopy and Nonlinear Optical Properties of aza&#8208;BODIPY Derivatives in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fast relaxation processes in the excited electronic states of functionalized aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (aza&#8208;BODIPY) derivatives were investigated in liquid media at room temperature, including the linear photophysical, photochemical, and nonlinear optical (NLO) properties.







Abstract
The fast relaxation processes in the excited electronic states of functionalized aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (aza&#8208;BODIPY) derivatives (1&#8211;4) were investigated in liquid media at room temperature, including the linear photophysical, photochemical, and nonlinear optical (NLO) properties. Optical gain was revealed for nonfluorescent derivatives 3 and 4 in the near infrared (NIR) spectral range under femtosecond excitation. The values of two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) and excited&#8208;state absorption (ESA) cross&#8208;sections were obtained for 1&#8211;4 in dichloromethane using femtosecond Z&#8208;scans, and the role of bromine substituents in the molecular structures of 2 and 4 is discussed. The nature of the excited states involved in electronic transitions of these dyes was investigated using quantum&#8208;chemical TD&#8208;DFT calculations, and the obtained spectral parameters are in reasonable agreement with the experimental data. Significant 2PA (maxima cross&#8208;sections &#8764;2000&#8197;GM), and large ESA cross&#8208;sections &#8764;10&#8722;20&#8197;m2 of these new aza&#8208;BODIPY derivatives 1&#8211;4 along with their measured high photostability reveal their potential for photonic applications in general and optical limiting in particular.

         <title>Tribo&#8208;Excited Chemical Reaction Using an EuIII Complex with a Stacked Anthracene Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tribo&#8208;excitation in a crystalline compound is an interesting phenomenon in which a mechanical stimulus drives the compound to its excited state. We demonstrate a tribo&#8208;excited chemical reaction using trivalent europium (EuIII) and gadolinium (GdIII) complexes with stacked anthracene ligands for the development of tribo&#8208;excitation chemistry. The tribo&#8208;oxidation and &#8208;dimerization reactions in the stacked anthracene ligands occur in the EuIII and GdIII complexes, respectively. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y.&#8197;Kitagawa, Y.&#8197;Hasegawa et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104401).

         <title>Enantioselective organophotocatalytic telescoped synthesis of a chiral privileged active pharmaceutical ingredient</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The continuous flow, enantioselective, organophotoredox catalytic asymmetric alkylation of aldehydes was studied, by using a homemade, custom designed photoreactor for reactions under cryogenic conditions. Going from microfluidic conditions up to a 10 mL mesofluidic reactor, an increase of productivity by almost 18000% compared to the batch reaction was demonstrated. Finally, for the first time, a stereoselective photoredox organocatalytic continuous flow reaction in a fully telescoped process for an API synthesis was successfully achieved. The final process consists of 4 units of operation: visible light&#8208;driven asymmetric catalytic benzylation under continuous flow, inline continuous work&#8208;up, neutralisation and a final oxidative amidation step afforded the pharmaceutically active molecule in 95% e.e.</dc:description>

         <title>Foldable detergents&#160;for membrane protein study: Importance of detergent core flexibility in protein stabilization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane proteins are of biological and pharmaceutical significance. However, their structural study is extremely challenging mainly due to the fact that only a small number of chemical tools is suitable for stabilizing membrane proteins in solution. Detergents are widely used in membrane protein study, but conventional detergents are generally poor at stabilizing challenging membrane proteins such as G protein&#8208;coupled receptors and protein complexes. In the current study, we prepared tandem triazine&#8208;based maltosides (TZMs) with two amphiphilic triazine units connected by different diamine linkers, hydrazine (TZM&#8208;Hs) and 1,2&#8208;ethylenediamine (TZM&#8208;Es). These TZMs were consistently superior to a gold standard detergent (DDM) in terms of stabilizing a few membrane proteins. In addition, the TZM&#8208;Es containing a long linker showed more general protein stabilization efficacy with multiple membrane proteins than the TZM&#8208;Hs containing a short linker. This result indicates that introduction of the flexible1,2&#8208;ethylenediamine linker between two rigid triazine rings enables the TZM&#8208;Es to fold into favourable conformations in order to promote membrane protein stability. The novel concept of detergent foldability introduced in the current study has potential use for rational detergent design and membrane protein applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Suberitines A&#8208;D Featuring Tunable Biomimetic Late&#8208;Stage Oxidative Dearomatization and Acetalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aaptaminoids are a unique family of marine alkaloids bearing a benzo[  de  ][1,6]&#8208;naphthyridine core. This work describes the first total synthesis of suberitines A&#8208;D (  1  &#8208;  4  ), four typical dimeric natural aaptaminoids, employing a step&#8208;saving bidirectional strategy. Key methods applied in the total synthesis include a cationic cascade to construct the bis&#8208;isoquinoline(s) with Hendrickson reagent&#8208;mediated Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;type cyclization and eliminative aromatization, and a Bronsted acid&#8208;promoted Vilsmeier cyclization to generate the naphthyridine(s). The conditionally tunable PIDA&#8208;mediated oxidative dearomatization and subsequent methanolysis or hydrolysis successfully served as a powerful biomimetic tool to elaborate the essential oxygenated functionalities of suberitines A&#8208;D (  1&#8208;4  ) in proper solvent&#8208;combinations at the final stage of total synthesis. The biomimetic proposal employed in the late&#8208;stage redox interchanges of related natural products was eventually supported by the isolation of synthetic intermediate  23a  as a natural product from the same natural source. Biological screening revealed that five of the synthetic samples including two natural suberitines and three full&#8208;skeleton natural product&#8208;like intermediates exhibited low micromolar inhibitory activities against the growth of cancer cell line K562.</dc:description>

         <title>Elaborated Reaction Pathway of Photothermal Catalytic CO2 Conversion with H2O on Gallium Oxide Decorating and Defective Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, Ga  2  O  3  &#8208;decorated and defective surface models based on anatase TiO  2  were established. The thermodynamic reaction pathways, including protonation, deoxygenation and hydroxylation steps, during CO  2  conversion with H  2  O to C1 products were calculated. The calculation results demonstrate that the Ga  2  O  3  cocatalyst enhances the selective adsorption of CO  2  and slightly weakens the competitive adsorption of H  2  O. The promotion effect of Ga  2  O  3  on the subsequent reaction depends on the availability of protons and electrons. Free energy calculations revealed that the basic functional site generated by Ga  2  O  3  not only suppresses the back reaction of the OH group after H  2  O directly provides protons but also maintains the surface defect oxygen vacancy (V  O  ), which promotes the reaction thermodynamics but tends to be consumed in the process. Additionally, Ga  2  O  3  decoration promotes V  O  formation, and the coexistence of Ga  2  O  3  and V  O  further decreases the reaction rate&#8208;determining step energy barrier, promoting C1 production.</dc:description>

         <title>Metalloimmunotherapy with rhodium and ruthenium complexes: Targeting tumor&#8208;associated macrophages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) suppress the cancer immune response and are a key target for immunotherapy. The effects of ruthenium and rhodium complexes on TAMs have not been well characterized. To address this gap in the field, a panel of 22 dirhodium and ruthenium complexes were screened against three subtypes of macrophages, triple&#8208;negative breast cancer and normal breast tissue cells. Experiments were carried out in 2D and biomimetic 3D co&#8208;culture experiments with and without irradiation with blue light. Leads were identified with cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific toxicity toward macrophage subtypes, cancer cells, or both. Experiments with 3D spheroids revealed complexes that sensitized the tumor models to the chemotherapeutic doxorubicin. Cell surface exposure of calreticulin, a known&#160;facilitator&#160;of immunogenic cell death (ICD), was increased upon treatment, along with a&#160;concomitant&#160;reduction in the M2&#8208;subtype classifier arginase. Our findings lay a strong foundation for the future development of ruthenium&#8208; and rhodium&#8208;based chemotherapies targeting TAMs.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemically Driven Swinging of a Nitrobenzyl Pendant Arm in a Nickel Scorpionand Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A radical anion &#8211;NO  2  &#8226;  &#8722;  is formed upon an electrochemically reversible one&#8208;electron reduction of the square&#8208;planar Ni  II  complex of  N  &#8208;nitrobenzylcyclam. The &#8211;NO  2  &#8226;  &#8722;  group goes to occupy an axial position of the metal ion, thus establishing a significant electronic interaction with the metal center. In particular, the ESR spectrum supports the occurrence of an electron transfer from &#8722;NO  2  &#8226;  &#8722;  to the metal, which therefore presents a significant Ni  I  character. On re&#8208;oxidation, the nitrobenzyl side&#8208;chain detaches and the Ni  II  complex is restored, providing an example of a fully reversible redox driven intramolecular motion.</dc:description>

The bridging ligands are laterally &#960;&#8208;extended by anellating a pyrene (  Ru2&#8208;7  ,  Ru2&#8208;8  ) or a 6,7&#8208;benzoquinoxaline (  Ru2&#8208;3  ,  Ru2&#8208;4  ) &#960;&#8208;perimeter. This was done with the hope that the open &#960;&#8208;faces of the electron&#8208;rich complexes will foster association with planar electron acceptors via &#960;&#8208;stacking. The dinuclear complexes were subjected to cyclic and square wave voltammetry and were characterized in all accessible redox states by IR, UV/Vis/NIR and, where applicable, by EPR spectroscopy.

The more electron&#8208;rich acac  &#8208;  congeners formed non&#8208;conductive 1:1 charge&#8208;transfer (CT) salts on treatment with the F4TCNQ electron acceptor. All spectroscopic techniques confirmed the presence of pairs of complex radical cations and F4TCNQ  &#8226;&#8208;  radical anions in these CT salts, but produced no firm evidence for the relevance of pi&#8208;stacking to their formation and properties.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>N,N&#8217;  &#8208;disubstituted indigos are photoswitchable molecules that have recently caught the attention due to their addressability by red&#8208;light.&#160;&#160;When alkyl and aryl groups are utilized as the&#160;  N  &#8208;substituents, the thermal half&#8208;lives of&#160;  Z  isomers can be tuned independently while maintaining the advantageous red&#8208;shifted absorption spectra.&#160;&#160;To utilize these molecules in real&#8208;world applications, it is of immense importance to understand how their molecular structures as well as the environment influence their switching properties.&#160;&#160;To this end, we probed their photoisomerization mechanism by carrying out photophysical and computational studies in solvents of different polarities.&#160;&#160;The fluorescence and transient absorption experiments suggest for more polar excited and transition states, which explains the bathochromic shifts of absorption spectra and shorter thermal half&#8208;lives.&#160;&#160;On the other hand, the quantum chemical calculations reveal that in contrast to&#160;  N  &#8208;carbonyl groups,&#160;  N  &#8208;alkyl and&#160;  N  &#8208;aryl substituents are not strongly conjugated with the indigo chromophore and can thus serve as a tool for tuning the thermal stability of&#160;  Z  &#160;isomers.&#160;&#160;Both approaches are combined to provide in&#8208;depth understandings of how indigos undergo photoswitching as well as how they are influenced by&#160;  N  &#8208;substituent and the chemical surroundings.&#160;&#160;These mechanistic insights will serve as guiding principles for designing molecules eyeing broader applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantum Chemistry&#8208;based Molecular Dynamics Simulations as a Tool for the Assignment of ESI&#8208;MS/MS Spectra of Drug Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In organic mass spectrometry, fragment ions provide important information on the analyte as a central part of its structure elucidation. With increasing molecular size and possible protonation sites, the potential energy surface (PES) of the analyte can become very complex, which results in a large number of possible fragmentation patterns. Quantum chemical (QC) calculations can help here, enabling the fast calculation of the PES and thus enhancing the mass spectrometry&#8208;based structure elucidation processes. In this work, the previously unknown fragmentation pathways of the two drug molecules Nateglinide (45 atoms) and Zopiclone (51 atoms) were investigated using a combination of&#160;generic formalisms and calculations conducted with the Quantum Chemical Mass Spectrometry (QCxMS) program. The computations of the de novo fragment spectra were conducted with the semi&#8208;empirical GFNn&#8208;xTB (n = 1, 2) methods and compared against Orbitrap measured electrospray ionization (ESI) spectra in positive ion mode. It was found that the unbiased QC calculations are particularly suitable to predict non&#8208;evident fragment ion structures, sometimes contrasting the accepted generic formulation of fragment ion structures from electron migration rules, where the "true" ion fragment structures are approximated. For the first time, all fragment and intermediate structures of these large&#8208;sized&#160;molecules could be elucidated completely and routinely using this merger of methods, finding new&#160;undocumented mechanisms, that are not considered in common rules published so far. Given the importance of ESI for medicinal chemistry, pharmacokinetics, and metabolomics, this approach can significantly enhance the mass spectrometry&#8208;based structure elucidation processes and contribute to the understanding of previously unknown fragmentation pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering of Portable Smartphone Integrated with Liposome&#8208;Encapsulated Curcumin for Onsite Visual Ratiometric Fluorescence Imaging of Hypochlorite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precisely onsite monitoring of hypochlorite (ClO  &#8722;  ) is of great significance to guide its rational use, reducing/avoiding its potential threat toward food safety and human health. Considering ClO  &#8722;  could quench fluorescence of curcumin (CCM) by oxidizing the  o  &#8208;methoxyphenol of CCM into benzoquinone, we designed a portable ratiometric fluorescence sensor integrated with smartphone for realizing the visual point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing (POCT) of ClO  &#8722;  . The amphiphilic phospholipid polymer was used as carrier to wrap curcumin, forming a novel liposome&#8208;encapsulated CCM, which provided a scaffold to bind with [Ru(bpy)  3  ]  2+  through electrostatic interaction, thus assembling [Ru(bpy)  3  ]  2+  &#8208;functionalized liposome&#8208;encapsulated CCM ([Ru(bpy)  3  ]  2+  @CCM&#8208;NPs). Further integrated with smartphone, visual imaging of [Ru(bpy)  3  ]  2+  @CCM&#8208;NPs could be achieved and the accurate onsite detection of ClO  &#8722;  could be realized with a detection limit of 66.31 nM and a linear range of 0.2210 to 80.0 &#956;M. In addition, the sensor could monitor ClO  &#8722;  in real samples with an onsite detection time of ~ 154.0 s.</dc:description>

         <title>Hetero&#8208;substituted &#945;&#946;&#8208;fused BODIPY</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report the synthesis and properties of heterosubtituted &#945;&#946;fused BODIPY fluorophores. The compounds were obtained in good yields by sequential and selective Stille cross&#8208;coupling reactions from 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrahalo&#8208;BODIPY, allowing the introduction of different subtituents at the 3,5 and 2,6 positions of the BODIPY ring. The final fused compounds were synthesized using oxidative cyclisation with ferrous chloride. The fully fused compounds show a strong bathochromically shifted emission along with a hyperchromic shift of the absorption maxima. The fluorescence quantum yields remain relatively large for compounds emitting in this wavelength range. Computational studies have been carried out to fully understand the photophysical behaviour of these dyes.</dc:description>

         <title>Relativistic Spin&#8211;Orbit Electronegativity and the Chemical Bond between a Heavy Atom and a Light Atom</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Relativistic effects are known to alter the chemical bonds and spectroscopic properties of heavy&#8208;element compounds. In this work, we introduce the concept of spin&#8211;orbit (SO) electronegativity of a heavy atom as reflected by an SO&#8208;induced change in the interatomic distance between the heavy atom (HA) and a neighboring light atom (LA). We provide a transparent interpretation of these SO effects by using the concept of spin&#8211;orbit electron deformation density (SO&#8208;EDD). Spin&#8211;orbit coupling at the HA induces rearrangement of the electron density for the scalar&#8208;relativistically optimized geometry that in turn exerts a new force on the LA. The resulting expansion or contraction of the HA&#8211;LA bond depends on the nature and electron configuration of the HA. In addition, we quantify the change in atomic electronegativity induced by SO coupling for a series of hydrides, complementing the SO&#8208;EDD picture. The trends in the SO&#8208;induced electronegativity and the HA&#8211;LA bond distance across the Periodic Table of Elements are demonstrated and interpreted, and also linked, intuitively, with the SO&#8208;induced NMR shielding at the LA.</dc:description>

         <title>Decoration Strategy in Para Boron Position: An Effective Way to Achieve Ideal Multi&#8208;Resonance Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Narrowband, full&#8208;color, and quenching&#8208;resistant emitters are urgently needed for the next generation high&#8208;resolution displays. Though the flourishment of narrowband multiple resonance (MR) emitters in blue region, these materials still face thorny challenges such as effective light&#8208;color regulation strategies and concentration&#8208;induced spectral broadening/emission quenching. Herein, we highlight the research status of an effective "decoration strategy for para B position". On one hand, the introduction of an electron donor or acceptor could induce a hypochromatic&#8208; or bathochromic&#8208;shift emission respectively without undesirable FWHM broadening. On the other hand, a more advanced molecular motif is further proposed through adopting a peripheral benzene ring on the para position of the B&#8208;substituted phenyl in MR core to construct the high&#8208;purity, high&#8208;efficiency, quenching&#8208;resistant and stable MR emitters. Such concept is expected to provide a possible way for the modification, optimization and expansion of MR emitters to meet more possible applications.</dc:description>

Critical to the success is the use of chemometrics&#8208;assisted &#8216;Design of Experiments&#8217; (DoE) optimisation during the development of the presented new synthetic approach, which allows to investigate the chemical space in a rational way.</dc:description>

         <title>Strong Antibiotic Activity of the Myxocoumarin Scaffold in vitro and in vivo</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The increasing emergence of resistances against established antibiotics is a substantial threat to human health. The discovery of new compounds with potent antibiotic activity is thus of utmost importance. Within this work, we identify strong antibiotic activity of the natural product myxocoumarin B from Stigmatella aurantiaca MYX&#8208;030 against a range of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens, including clinical isolates of MRSA. A focused library of structural analogs was synthesized to explore initial structure&#8208;activity relationships and to identify equipotent myxocoumarin derivatives devoid of the natural nitro substituent to significantly streamline synthetic access. The cytotoxicity of the myxocoumarins as well as their potential to cure bacterial infections in vivo was established using a zebrafish model system. Our results reveal the exceptional antibiotic activity of the myxocoumarin scaffold and hence its potential for the development of novel antibiotics.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The regioselective&#160;[3+3]&#160;annulations of alkynyl ketimines with  &#945;  &#8208;cyano ketones for the&#160;synthesis of&#160;polysubstituted 4  H  &#8208;pyran derivatives&#160;with a quaternary CF  3  &#8208;containing center has been realized by using Cu(OAc)  2  &#160;as the catalyst. The novel strategy tolerates a wide range&#160;of  &#945;  &#8208;CF  3  alkynyl&#160;ketimines and  &#945;  &#8208;cyano ketones&#160;with both aryl and alkyl substitutents.

         <title>Helical Chiral N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Ligands in Enantioselective Gold Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical&#8208;NHC ligands were for the first time used as chiral ligands in enantioselective gold(I) catalysis. The introduction of the chirality was realized in a key post&#8208;functionalization step and led to the generation of a chiral NHC laterally substituted by a new configurationally stable [5]&#8208;helicoidal moiety. This structural design allowed good activities and high ee values in the gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of N&#8208;tethered enynes.







Abstract
The first chiral helicene&#8208;NHC gold(I) complexes efficient in enantioselective catalysis were prepared. The L&#8208;shaped chiral ligand is composed of an imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;ylidene (IPy) scaffold laterally substituted by a configurationally stable [5]&#8208;helicenoid unit. The chiral information was introduced in a key post&#8208;functionalization step of a NHC&#8208;gold(I) complex bearing a symmetrical anionic fluoreno[5]helicene substituent, leading to a racemic mixture of complexes featuring three correlated elements of chirality, namely central, axial and helical chirality. After HPLC enantiomeric resolution, X&#8208;ray crystallography and theoretical calculations enabled structural and stereochemical characterization of these configurationally stable NHC&#8208;gold(I) complexes. The high potential in asymmetric catalysis is demonstrated in the benchmark cycloisomerization of N&#8208;tethered 1,6&#8208;enynes with up to 95&#8201;:&#8201;5 er.

         <title>Transition Metal Catalyst Free Synthesis of Olefins from Organoboron Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Many boron based olefinations proceed via intermediates with leaving groups &#946;&#8208;positon. These can undergo stereospecific syn&#8208; or anti&#8208;elimination and are useful for the synthesis of complex olefins. Three main strategies emerged differing in the preparation of the pivotal intermediate: (i) Diastereospecific methods like the addition of a boron&#8208;stabilized anion (d1) to an aldehyde or ketone (a1), (ii) Diastereospecific 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangements of boron&#8208;ate&#8208;complexes with appropriate heterocycles and (iii) addition of chiral carbenoids (d1) to boronates with a suitable group in &#945;&#8208;position (a1).







Abstract
Stereoselective preparation of highly substituted olefins is still a severe challenge that requires well defined elimination precursors. Organoboron chemistry is particularly suited for the preparation of molecules with adjacent stereocenters. As organo boron substrates with leaving groups in &#946;&#8208;position can undergo stereospecific syn&#8208; or anti&#8208;elimination, this chemistry harbors great potential for the synthesis of complex olefins. In recent years three main strategies emerged, which differ in their approach to the &#946;&#8208;functionalized organoboron elimination precursor. (i) Stereoselective preparation of such elimination precursor can be achieved by addition of a boron&#8208;stabilized anion (d1) to an aldehyde or ketone (a1) or diastereoselective 1,3&#8208;rearrangement of suitable boron&#8208;ate&#8208;complexes. Stereospecific methods rely either on (ii) diastereospecific 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangement of boron&#8208;ate&#8208;complexes that involve opening of appropriate heterocycles or (iii) addition of chiral carbenoids (d1*) to chiral boronates (a1*) with a leaving group in &#945;&#8208;position.

&#8220;N&#8208;hancing&#8221; the electron&#8208;acceptor strength by isosteric [CH&#8594;N] replacement in the peropyrene polycyclic aromatic core. The synthesis of an octaazaperopyrene (OAPP) dye is described along with its electrochemical and photophysical properties and placed in the general context of N&#8208;heteroatom derivatives of such polycyclic functional dyes. Their strong electron&#8208;acceptor properties render OAPPs borderline cases of molecular stability under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Ortho substituted octaazaperopyrenes (OAPPs) are a new class of functional dyes characterized by their strong electron&#8208;accepting behavior. Herein, the synthesis, as well as the electrochemical and photo physical properties of an OAPP dye, is reported. The OAPP target was prepared via selective nucleophilic substitution at the peri position of a bay chlorinated tetraazaperylene by introduction of four amino&#8208;substituents. The resulting tetraminoperylene was reacted with different acyl chlorides and anhydrides to give the twisted bay chlorinated OAPP derivatives which were isolated in their reduced dihydro&#8208;form. The OAPP target could be obtained via a palladium catalyzed dehalogenation and a subsequent oxidation. The eightfold isosteric [CH&#8594;N] replacement within the peropyrene core structure results in a large decrease of the frontier orbital energies, rendering the target compound a potent oxidant while preserving the planarity of the aromatic core. The radical anion was obtained by reduction of the OAPP with KC8 and characterized by EPR spectroscopy. A general discussion of the number and location of [CH&#8594;N] replacements in peropyrene structures and their frontier orbital energies is provided.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Promoted Radical Ring&#8208;Opening/Pyridylation of Cyclobutanols with N&#8208;Methoxypyridinium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient silver&#8208;catalyzed radical ring&#8208;opening/pyridylation of tertiary cyclobutanol with N&#8208;methoxypyridinium salts has been achieved for the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;ketopyridines. The overall process is thought to occur by &#946;&#8208;scission of the corresponding cyclobutoxy radical to generate an alkyl radical, that adds to the pyridinium salt. A wide range of tertiary cyclobutanols and N&#8208;methoxypyridinium salts are compatible with these reaction conditions.







Abstract
The silver&#8208;promoted reaction of tertiary cyclobutanols with N&#8208;methoxypyridinium salts enables the efficient synthesis of a range of C2&#8208;substituted pyridines. The overall process likely occurs by ring&#8208;opening (via &#946;&#8208;scission) of the cyclobutoxy radical to generate the corresponding &#947;&#8208;keto alkyl radical that itself adds to the pyridinium salt.

         <title>Diradicals photogeneration from chloroaryl substituted carboxylic acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the aim of generating new, thermally inaccessible diradicals, potentially able to induce a double&#8208;strand DNA cleavage, the photochemistry of a set of chloroaryl substituted carboxylic acids in polar media was investigated. The photoheterolytic cleavage of the Ar&#8722;Cl bond occurred in each case to form the corresponding triplet phenyl cations. Under basic conditions, the photorelease of the chloride anion was accompanied by an intramolecular electron&#8208;transfer from the carboxylate group to the aromatic radical cationic site to give a diradical species. This latter intermediate could then undergo CO2 loss in a structure&#8208;dependent fashion, according to the stability of the resulting diradical, or abstract hydrogen atom from the medium. In aqueous environment at physiological pH (pH = 7.3), both a phenyl cation and a diradical chemistry was observed. The mechanistic scenario and the role of the various intermediates (aryl cations and diradicals) involved in the process was supported by computational analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical fibrous honeycomb ceramics with high load capability and low light&#8208;off temperature for the next&#8208;generation auto emissions standards</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel and stringent automotive exhaust gas emissions standards are urgently needed to counter the problems posed by the worsening global climate and environment. However, the traditional cordierite&#8208;based honeycomb ceramics substrates with ultimate pore density have seriously restricted the establishment of new emission standards. Herein, we introduce a novel robust substrate with tailored volume&#8208;specific surface area and low heat capacity. This substrate employs the synergy of high&#8208;strength ceramic fibers and ultrathin TiO  2  nanosheets. The micro&#8208;sized fibers provide support to ensure structural strength during the catalytic reaction, while the nanosheets play the dual role of connecting the fibers and providing a high surface area for catalyst immobilization. The new three&#8208;dimensional (3D) microarchitecture exhibits a high volume&#8208;specific surface area of 3.59 &#215; 10  4  cm  2  /cm  3  , a compressive strength of 2.01 MPa, and remarkable stability after high&#8208;speed air erosion at 800&#176;C. The honeycomb&#8208;like structure exhibit low resistance to gas flow. Furthermore, after loading with Pt and Pd nanoparticles, the composite 3D microarchitecture delivered an excellent catalytic performance and prominent structural stability, with a super low light&#8208;off temperature of 150&#176;C. The outstanding mechanical and thermal stability and the high surface area and light&#8208;off temperature of the new substrate indicate its potential for use as a highly efficient catalytic carrier to meet the next&#8208;generation auto emissions standards.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron/Hole Transporting Materials for Nonfullerene Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonfullerene acceptor based organic solar cells (NF&#8208;OSCs) have witnessed rapid progress over the past few years owing to the intensive research efforts on novel electron donor and nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) materials, interfacial engineering, and device processing techniques. Interfacial layers including electron transporting layers (ETL) and hole transporting layers (HTLs) are crucially important in the OSCs for facilitating electron and hole extractions from the photoactive blend to the respective electrodes. In this review, the progress in both ETLs and HTLs for the currently prevailing NF&#8208;OSCs are discussed, in which the ETLs are summarized from the categories of metal oxides, metal chelates, non&#8208;conjugated electrolytes and conjugated electrolytes, and the HTLs are summarized from the categories of inorganic and organic materials. Some facile methods to develop efficient ETL/HTL materials for high&#8208;performance NF&#8208;OSCs are also highlighted. Finally, the futural prospects of ETL/HTL materials for NF&#8208;OSCs are provided.</dc:description>
