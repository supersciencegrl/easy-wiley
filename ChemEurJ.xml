      <title>Allylic and Allenylic Dearomatization of Indoles promoted by Graphene Oxide via Covalent Grafting Activation Mode</title>
      <dc:description>The site&#8208;selective allylative and allenylative dearomatization of indoles with alcohols is performed under carbocatalytic regime in the presence of graphene oxide (GO, 10 wt% loading) as the promoter. Metal&#8208;free conditions, absence of stoichiometric additive, environmentally friendly conditions (H2O/CH3CN, 55 &#176;C, 6 h), broad substrate scope (33 examples, yield up to 92%) and excellent site&#8208; and stereoselectivity characterize the present methodology. Moreover, a covalent activation model exerted by GO functionalities was corroborated by spectroscopic, experimental and computational evidences. Recovering and regeneration of the GO catalyst via simple acidic treatment was also documented.</dc:description>

      <title>Esterification of Tertiary Amides: Remarkable Additive Effects of Potassium Alkoxides for Generating Hetero Manganese&#8208;Potassium Dinuclear Active Species</title>
      <dc:description>A catalyst system of mononuclear manganese precursor  3  combined with potassium alkoxide served as a superior catalyst compared with our previously reported manganese homodinuclear catalyst  2a  for esterification of not only tertiary aryl amides, but also tertiary aliphatic amides. On the basis of stoichiometric reactions of  3  and potassium alkoxide salt, kinetic studies, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we clarified a plausible reaction mechanism in which  in situ  generated manganese&#8208;potassium heterodinuclear species cooperatively activate the carbonyl moiety of the amide and the OH moiety of the alcohols. We also revealed the details of the reaction mechanism of our previous manganese homodinuclear system  2a  , and we found that activation free energy (  &#916;G  &#8225;  ) for the manganese&#8208;potassium heterodinuclear complex catalyzed esterification of amides is lower than that for manganese homo dinuclear system, which was consistent with the experimental results.

      <title>Conformation control of conjugated polymers</title>
      <dc:description>In the past few decades, conjugated polymers have aroused extensive interest in organic electronic applications. The electrical performance of conjugated polymers has a close relationship with their backbone conformation. The conformation of the polymer backbone strongly affects the &#960;&#173;electron delocalization along polymer chains, the energy bandgap, interchain interactions, and further affecting charge transport properties. To realize a rigid coplanar backbone that usually possesses efficient intrachain charge transport properties and enhanced &#960;&#8208;&#960; stackings, such conformation control becomes a useful strategy to achieve the high&#8208;performance (semi)conducting polymers. This review summarizes the most important polymer structures through conformation control at molecular levels, and then divides these rigid coplanar conjugated polymers into three categories: 1) non&#8208;covalent interactions locked conjugated polymers; 2) double&#8208;bond linked conjugated polymers; 3) ladder conjugated polymers.

      <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers of Nitron: Self&#8208;Activated and Chemically Addressable N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Monolayers with Triazolone Structural Motif</title>
      <dc:description>N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have emerged as a unique molecular platform for the formation of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) on various surfaces. However, active carbene formation requires deprotonation of imidazolium salt precursors, which is mostly facilitated by exposure of the salt to exogenous base. Base residues were found to be adsorbed on the metal surface and hindered the formation of well&#8208;ordered carbene&#8208;based monolayers. Herein, we show that nitron, a triazolone&#8208;based molecule that freely tautomerizes into carbene, can spontaneously self&#8208;assemble into monolayers on Pt and Au surfaces, overcoming the necessity for base&#8208;induced deprotonation for active carbene formation. SAMs of nitron were found thermally stable and could not be displaced by thiols, demonstrating their high chemical stability. The addressable amine group in surface&#8208;anchored nitron was shown to be chemically available for SN2 reaction, making the surface&#8208;anchored nitron a chemically&#8208;addressable cross&#8208;linking reagent for surface modifications.</dc:description>

      <title>Stiff&#8208;Stilbene Ligands Target G&#8208;Quadruplex DNA and Exhibit Selective Anticancer and Antiparasitic Activity
</title>
      <dc:description>
Stiff scaffolds: Stiff&#8208;stilbene has very recently emerged as a promising scaffold for the design of selective G&#8208;quadruplex DNA ligands. We demonstrate the importance of substituent chemistry and molecular geometry on the activity of this novel ligand series. Compounds exhibit up to 700&#8208;fold selective toxicity to parasitic organisms and 30&#8208;fold selective toxicity to cervical cancer cells over a non&#8208;tumoral mammalian cell model.







Abstract
G&#8208;quadruplex nucleic acid structures have long been studied as anticancer targets whilst their potential in antiparasitic therapy has only recently been recognized and barely explored. Herein, we report the synthesis, biophysical characterization, and in vitro screening of a series of stiff&#8208;stilbene G4 binding ligands featuring different electronics, side&#8208;chain chemistries, and molecular geometries. The ligands display selectivity for G4 DNA over duplex DNA and exhibit nanomolar toxicity against Trypasanoma brucei and HeLa cancer cells whilst remaining up to two orders of magnitude less toxic to non&#8208;tumoral mammalian cell line MRC&#8208;5. Our study demonstrates that stiff&#8208;stilbenes show exciting potential as the basis of selective anticancer and antiparasitic therapies. To achieve the most efficient G4 recognition the scaffold must possess the optimal electronics, substitution pattern and correct molecular configuration.

      <title>Magnesocenophane&#8208;Catalyzed Amine Borane Dehydrocoupling</title>
      <dc:description>
Magnesocenophanes in catalysis: The dehydrocoupling of dimethylamine borane to cyclic tetramethyldiborazane under ambient conditions, catalyzed by a [1]magnesocenophane, is described. This is the first example of a magnesium&#8208;based catalyst for this reaction that operates at room temperature. Based on experimental investigations and DFT calculations, a ligand&#8208;assisted mechanism involving stepwise proton and hydride transfer is proposed.







Abstract
The Lewis acidities of a series of [n]magnesocenophanes (1&#8201;a&#8211;d) have been investigated computationally and found to be a function of the tilt of the cyclopentadienyl moieties. Their catalytic abilities in amine borane dehydrogenation/dehydrocoupling reactions have been probed, and C[1]magnesocenophane (1&#8201;a) has been shown to effectively catalyze the dehydrogenation/dehydrocoupling of dimethylamine borane (2&#8201;a) and diisopropylamine borane (2&#8201;b) under ambient conditions.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Magnesocenophanes in catalysis&lt;/b&gt;: The dehydrocoupling of dimethylamine borane to cyclic tetramethyldiborazane under ambient conditions, catalyzed by a [1]magnesocenophane, is described. This is the first example of a magnesium&#8208;based catalyst for this reaction that operates at room temperature. Based on experimental investigations and DFT calculations, a ligand&#8208;assisted mechanism involving stepwise proton and hydride transfer is proposed.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lewis acidities of a series of [&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;]magnesocenophanes (&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;d&lt;/b&gt;) have been investigated computationally and found to be a function of the tilt of the cyclopentadienyl moieties. Their catalytic abilities in amine borane dehydrogenation/dehydrocoupling reactions have been probed, and C[1]magnesocenophane (&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;) has been shown to effectively catalyze the dehydrogenation/dehydrocoupling of dimethylamine borane (&lt;b&gt;2&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;) and diisopropylamine borane (&lt;b&gt;2&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;) under ambient conditions. Furthermore, the mechanism of the reaction with &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; has been investigated experimentally and computationally, and the results imply a ligand&#8208;assisted mechanism involving stepwise proton and hydride transfer, with dimethylaminoborane as the key intermediate.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Regio&#8208; and Stereoselectivities of Testosterone and Dihydrotestosterone Hydroxylation Catalyzed by CYP3A4 and CYP19A1</title>
      <dc:description>
Selective insertion: The results of a theoretical study on the selective hydroxylation of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone by CYP3A4 and CYP19A1 is reported (see scheme).







Abstract
The hydroxylation of nonreactive C&#8722;H bonds can be easily catalyzed by a variety of metalloenzymes, especially cytochrome P450s (P450s). The mechanism of P450 mediated hydroxylation has been intensively studied, both experimentally and theoretically. However, understanding the regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities of substrates hydroxylated by P450s remains a great challenge. Herein, we use a multi&#8208;scale modeling approach to investigate the selectivity of testosterone (TES) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) hydroxylation catalyzed by two important P450s, CYP3A4 and CYP19A1. For CYP3A4, two distinct binding modes for TES/DHT were predicted by dockings and molecular dynamics simulations, in which the experimentally identified sites of metabolism of TES/DHT can access to the catalytic center. The regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities of TES/DHT hydroxylation were further evaluated by quantum mechanical and ONIOM calculations. For CYP19A1, we found that sites 1&#946;, 2&#946; and 19 can access the catalytic center, with the intrinsic reactivity 2&#946;&gt;1&#946;&gt;19. However, our ONIOM calculations indicate that the hydroxylation is favored at site 19 for both TES and DHT, which is consistent with the experiments and reflects the importance of the catalytic environment in determining the selectivity. Our study unravels the mechanism underlying the selectivity of TES/DHT hydroxylation mediated by CYP3A4 and CYP19A1 and is helpful for understanding the selectivity of other substrates that are hydroxylated by P450s.

      <title>Probing the Electrostatic Barrier of Tetrathiafulvalene Dications using a Tetra&#8208;stable Donor&#8211;Acceptor [2]Rotaxane</title>

Control of directionality is of paramount importance if rectified motion in electroactive molecular machines should be realized. As illustrated in the cover artwork, the tetracationic ring (blue) in a tetraoxidized [2]rotaxane can follow two different tracks; it transpires that it is easier for the ring to follow a track in which it has to move across a monopyrrolotetrathiafulvalene dication (dark green) compared to the track in which it moves across a tetrathiafulvalene dication (light green).

Abstract
A general and efficient strategy for synthesis of tri&#8208;, hexa&#8208; and heptasaccharidic substructures of the lipopolysaccharide of Providencia rustigianii O34 is described. For the heptasaccharide seven different building blocks were employed. Special features of the structures are an &#945;&#8208;linked galactosamine and the two embedded &#945;&#8208;fucose units, which are either branched at positions&#8208;3 and &#8208;4 or further linked at their 2&#8208;position. Convergent strategies focused on [4+3], [3+4], and [4+2+1] couplings. Whereas the [4+3] and [3+4] coupling strategies failed the [4+2+1] strategy was successful. As monosaccharidic building blocks trichloroacetimidates and phosphates were employed. Global deprotection of the fully protected structures was achieved by Birch reaction.

      <title>A Microfluidic Co&#8208;Flow Route for Human Serum Albumin&#8208;Drug&#8211;Nanoparticle Assembly</title>
      <dc:description>
Nanotechnology: We demonstrate a microfluidic co&#8208;flow device to produce drug&#8208;loaded albumin nanoparticles without additional cross&#8208;linking steps. This method showed high loading efficiency of the lipophilic drug celastrol, which created spherical nanoparticles with considerable reduced drug cytotoxicity (see figure).







Abstract
Nanoparticles are widely studied as carrier vehicles in biological systems because their size readily allows access through cellular membranes. Moreover, they have the potential to carry cargo molecules and as such, these factors make them especially attractive for intravenous drug delivery purposes. Interest in protein&#8208;based nanoparticles has recently gained attraction due to particle biocompatibility and lack of toxicity. However, the production of homogeneous protein nanoparticles with high encapsulation efficiencies, without the need for additional cross&#8208;linking or further engineering of the molecule, remains challenging. Herein, we present a microfluidic 3D co&#8208;flow device to generate human serum albumin/celastrol nanoparticles by co&#8208;flowing an aqueous protein solution with celastrol in ethanol. This microscale co&#8208;flow method resulted in the formation of nanoparticles with a homogeneous size distribution and an average size, which could be tuned from &#8776;100&#8197;nm to 1&#8197;&#956;m by modulating the flow rates used. We show that the high stability of the particles stems from the covalent cross&#8208;linking of the naturally present cysteine residues within the particles formed during the assembly step. By choosing optimal flow rates during synthesis an encapsulation efficiency of 75&#177;24&#8201;% was achieved. Finally, we show that this approach achieves significantly enhanced solubility of celastrol in the aqueous phase and, crucially, reduced cellular toxicity.

      <title>Modulation of a Supramolecular Figure&#8208;Of&#8208;Eight Strip&#160;Based on a Photo&#8208;Switchable Stiff&#8208;Stilbene</title>
      <dc:description>The preparation, assembly and dynamic properties of photoswitchable bisphosphine ligands based on the stiff&#8208;stilbene scaffold are reported. Directional bonding and coordination&#8208;induced assembly allow complexation of these ligands with palladium(II), resulting in the formation of discrete metallo&#8208;supramolecular entities. While the  Z  isomer forms a simple bidentate metallo&#8208;macrocycle, an intricate double helicate figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight&#160;dimer is observed with the  E  ligand. Topologically three&#8208;dimensional complexes can thus be obtained from two&#8208;dimensional ligands. Upon irradiation with UV light, isomerization of the ligands allows control of the architecture of the formed complexes, resulting in a light&#8208;triggered modulation of the supramolecular topology. Furthermore, a mechanistic investigation unveiled the dynamic nature of the helicate chirality, where a transmission of motion from the palladium centers yields an &#8220;eight&#8208;to&#8208;eight&#8221; inversion.</dc:description>

Ab initio  studies revealed the dz2  character of the magnetic orbitals of the compressed trigonal bipyramidal copper(II) ions. Ferromagnetic interactions were attributed to weak orbital overlap  via  the pyrazolate bridges. From the wavefunctions expansions, the ratios of the magnetic couplings was determined, which was indeterminate by magnetic susceptometry. Single&#8208;crystal EPR studies of  1  were carried out to extend the spin Hamiltonian with terms which induce zero&#8208;field splitting (zfs), namely dipolar interactions, anisotropic exchange and Dzyaloshinskii&#8208;Moriya interactions (DMI). The data were treated through both a giant&#8208;spin model and through a multispin exchange&#8208;coupled model. The latter indicated that ~62% of the zfs is due to anisotropic and ~38% due to dipolar interactions. The powder EPR data of all complexes were fitted to a simplified form of the multispin model and the anisotropic and dipolar contributions to the ground state zfs were estimated.</dc:description>

      <title>Probing the Electrostatic Barrier of Tetrathiafulvalene Dications using a Tetra&#8208;stable Donor&#8211;Acceptor [2]Rotaxane</title>
      <dc:description>
A tetra&#8208;stable donor&#8211;acceptor [2]rotaxane, composed of an oxyphenylene (OP), a tetrathiafulvalene (TTF), a monopyrrolo&#8208;TTF (MPTTF), and a hydroquinone (HQ) unit in the dumbbell component and encircled by the tetra&#8208;cationic cyclophane cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene) (CBPQT4+) was used to probe the electrostatic barriers for the movement of CBPQT4+ across an MPTTF2+ and a TTF2+ dication.







Abstract
A tetra&#8208;stable donor&#8211;acceptor [2]rotaxane 1&#8901;4PF6 has been synthesized. The dumbbell component is comprised of an oxyphenylene (OP), a tetrathiafulvalene (TTF), a monopyrrolo&#8208;TTF (MPTTF), and a hydroquinone (HQ) unit, which can act as recognition sites (stations) for the tetra&#8208;cationic cyclophane cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene) (CBPQT4+). The TTF and the MPTTF stations are located in the middle of the dumbbell component and are connected by a triethylene glycol (TEG) chain in such a way that the pyrrole moiety of the MPTTF station points toward the TTF station, while the TTF and MPTTF stations are flanked by the OP and HQ stations on their left hand side and right hand side, respectively. The [2]rotaxane was characterized in solution by 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The spectroscopic data revealed that the majority (77&#8201;%) of the tetra&#8208;stable [2]rotaxane 14+ exist as the translational isomer 1&#8901;MPTTF4+ in which the CBPQT4+ ring encircles the MPTTF station. The electrochemical studies showed that CBPQT4+ in 1&#8901;MPTTF4+ undergoes ring translation as result of electrostatic repulsion from the oxidized MPTTF unit. Following tetra&#8208;oxidation of 1&#8901;MPTTF4+, a high&#8208;energy state of 18+ was obtained (i.e., 1&#8901;TEG8+) in which the CBPQT4+ ring was located on the TEG linker connecting the di&#8208;oxidized TTF2+ and MPTTF2+ units. 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy carried out in CD3CN at 298&#8197;K on a chemically oxidized sample of 1&#8901;MPTTF4+ revealed that the metastable state 1&#8901;TEG8+ is only short&#8208;lived with a lifetime of a few minutes and it was found that 70&#8201;% of the positively charged CBPQT4+ ring moved from 1&#8901;TEG8+ to the HQ station, while 30&#8201;% moved to the much weaker OP station. These results clearly demonstrate that the CBPQT4+ ring can cross both an MPTTF2+ and a TTF2+ electrostatic barrier and that the free energy of activation required to cross MPTTF2+ is ca. 0.5&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 smaller as compared to TTF2+.

&lt;sup&gt;8+&lt;/sup&gt; was obtained (i.e., &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8901;TEG&lt;sup&gt;8+&lt;/sup&gt;) in which the CBPQT&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; ring was located on the TEG linker connecting the di&#8208;oxidized TTF&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and MPTTF&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; units. &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy carried out in CD&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN at 298&#8197;K on a chemically oxidized sample of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8901;MPTTF&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; revealed that the metastable state &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8901;TEG&lt;sup&gt;8+&lt;/sup&gt; is only short&#8208;lived with a lifetime of a few minutes and it was found that 70&#8201;% of the positively charged CBPQT&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; ring moved from &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8901;TEG&lt;sup&gt;8+&lt;/sup&gt; to the HQ station, while 30&#8201;% moved to the much weaker OP station. These results clearly demonstrate that the CBPQT&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; ring can cross both an MPTTF&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and a TTF&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; electrostatic barrier and that the free energy of activation required to cross MPTTF&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is ca. 0.5&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; smaller as compared to TTF&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Approaching Dissolved Species in Ammonoacidic GaN Crystal Growth: A Combined Solution NMR and Computational Study</title>
      <dc:description>
Materials synthesis: A combination of solution NMR in liquid ammonia with quantum mechanical and molecular modelling allows identifying the dissolved species and their mineralizer concentration dependent solubility in ammonoacidic solutions with relevance for GaN crystal growth (see figure).







Abstract
Solutions of gallium trihalides GaX3 (X=F, Cl, Br, I) and their ammoniates in liquid ammonia were studied at ambient temperature under autogenous pressure by multinuclear (71Ga, 35Cl, 81Br) NMR spectroscopy. To unravel the role of pH, the analyses were done both in absence and in presence of ammonium halides, which are employed as mineralizers during ammonoacidic gallium nitride crystal growth. While gallium trifluoride and its ammoniate were found to be too sparingly soluble to give rise to a NMR signal, the spectra of solutions of the heavier halides reveal the presence of a single gallium&#8208;containing species in all cases. DFT calculations and molecular dynamics simulations suggest the identification of this species as consisting of a [Ga(NH3)6]3+ cation and up to six surrounding halide anions, resulting in an overall trend towards negative complex charge. Quantitative 71Ga&#8197;NMR studies on saturated solutions of GaCl3 containing various amounts of additional NH4Cl revealed a near linear increase of GaCl3 solubility with mineralizer concentration of about 0.023&#8197;mol GaCl3 per mol NH4Cl at room temperature. These findings reflect the importance of Coulombic shielding for the inhibition of oligomerization and precipitation processes and help to rationalize both the low solubility of gallium halides in neutral ammonia solution and, in turn, the proliferating effect of the mineralizer during ammonoacidic gallium nitride formation.

      <title>Synthesis and Assembly of Zinc Oxide Microcrystals by a Low&#8208;Temperature Dissolution&#8211;Reprecipitation Process: Lessons Learned About Twin Formation in Heterogeneous Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Crystal shape: Doping is an effective way to control crystal shape in mineralization processes. Studying the synthesis of single&#8208;crystalline hexagonal platelets of Co&#8208;doped ZnO with advanced high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) techniques can hereby provide an instructive insight into the details of the formation mechanism.







Abstract
Cobalt&#8208;doped zinc oxide single crystals with the shape of hexagonal platelets were synthesized by thermohydrolysis of zinc acetate, cobalt acetate, and hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) in mixtures of ethanol and water. The mineralization proceeds by a low&#8208;temperature dissolution&#8211;reprecipitation process from the liquid phase by the formation of basic cobalt zinc salts as intermediates. The crystal shape as well as twin formation of the resulting oxide phase can be influenced by careful choice of the solvent mixture and the amount of doping. An understanding of the course of the reaction was achieved by comprehensive employment of analytical techniques (i.e., SEM, XRD, IR) including an in&#8208;depth HRTEM study of precipitates from various reaction stages. In addition, EPR as well as UV/Vis spectroscopic measurements provide information about the insertion of the cobalt dopant into the zincite lattice. The Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett (LB) technique is shown to be suitable for depositing coatings of the platelets on glass substrates functionalized with polyelectrolyte multilayers and hence is applied for the formation of monolayers containing domains with ordered tessellation. No major differences are found between deposits on substrates with anionic or cationic surface modification. The adherence to the substrates is sufficient to determine the absolute orientation of the deposited polar single crystals by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) studies.

      <title>Endohedral Plumbaspherenes of the Group 9 Metals: Synthesis, Structure and Properties of the [M@Pb12]3&#8722; (M=Co, Rh, Ir) Ions</title>
      <dc:description>
The many faces of metals: The icosahedral [M@Pb12]3&#8722; (M=Co(1), Rh(2), Ir(3)) clusters ions were prepared and fully characterized via EDX/X&#8208;ray crystallography/LDI&#8208;TOF/DFT studies.

Abstract
The icosahedral [M@Pb12]3&#8722; (M=Co(1), Rh(2), Ir(3)) cluster ions were prepared from K4Pb9 and Co(dppe)Cl2 (dppe=1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane)/[Rh(PPh3)3Cl]/[Ir(cod)Cl]2 (cod=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene), respectively, in the presence of 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6/ 2,2,2&#8208;cryptand in ethylenediamine/toluene solvent mixtures. The [K(2,2,2&#8208;cryptand)]+ salt of 1 and the [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)]+ salt of 3 were characterized via X&#8208;ray crystallography; the ions 1 and 3 are isostructural and isoelectronic to the [Rh@Pb12]3&#8722; (2) ion as well as to the group&#8197;10 clusters [M&#8242;@Pb12]2&#8722; (M&#8242;=Ni, Pd, Pt). The ions are all 26&#8208;electron clusters with near perfect icosahedral Ih point symmetry. Clusters 1&#8211;3 show record downfield 207Pb&#8197;NMR chemical shifts due to &#963;&#8208;aromaticity of the cluster framework. Calculated and observed 207Pb&#8197;NMR chemical shifts and 207Pb&#8211;xM J&#8208;couplings (xM=59Co, 103Rh, 193Ir) are in excellent agreement and DFT analysis shows that the variations of 207Pb&#8197;NMR chemical shifts for the [M@Pb12]2,&#8201;3&#8722; ions (M=Co, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt) are mainly governed by the perpendicularly oriented &#963;11 component of the chemical shift anisotropy tensor. The laser desorption ionization time&#8208;of&#8208;flight (LDI&#8208;TOF) mass spectra contain the molecular ions as well as several new gas phase clusters derived from the parents. The DFT&#8208;minimized structures of these ions are described.

The laser desorption ionization time&#8208;of&#8208;flight (LDI&#8208;TOF) mass spectra contain the molecular ions as well as several new gas phase clusters derived from the parents. The DFT&#8208;minimized structures of these ions are described.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pyrrolic and Dipyrrolic Chlorophyll Degradation Products in Plants and Herbivores</title>
      <dc:description>
On its degradation: Evidence for a further pathway of chlorophyll degradation was found in plants and herbivores. Mono&#8208; and dipyrrolic compounds, known from heme degradation, were detected and quantified in leaves, spit and feces of herbivores. Novel natural products were detected and the structure of one, dihydro BOX A, was proven by synthesis.







Abstract
The degradation of chlorophyll, the omnipresent green pigment, has been investigated intensively over the last 30&#8197;years resulting in many elucidated tetrapyrrolic degradation products. With a comparison to the degradation of the structurally similar heme, we hereby propose a novel additional chlorophyll degradation mechanism to mono&#8208; and dipyrrolic products. This is the first proof of the occurrence of a family of mono&#8208; and dipyrrols in leaves that are previously only known as heme degradation products. This product family is also found in spit and feces of herbivores with specific metabolomic patterns reflecting the origin of the samples. Based on chromatographic and mass spectrometric evidence as well as on mechanistic considerations we also suggest several tentative new degradation products. One of them, dihydro BOX&#8197;A, was fully confirmed as a novel natural product by synthesis and comparison of its spectroscopic data.

      <title>Further Evidence for &#8216;Extended&#8217; Cumulene Complexes: Derivatives from Reactions with Halide Anions and Water</title>
      <dc:description>
Reactions of 4&#8208;ethynyl metal phenyl&#8208; or thienyl&#8208;acetylide complexes with electrophiles produce reaction products consistent with the formation of quinoidal and thienyl cumulenes.







Abstract
Reactions of [Ru{C=C(H)&#8208;1,4&#8208;C6H4C&#8801;CH}(PPh3)2Cp]BF4 ([1&#8201;a]BF4) with hydrohalic acids, HX, results in the formation of [Ru{C&#8801;C&#8208;1,4&#8208;C6H4&#8208;C(X)=CH2}(PPh3)2Cp] [X=Cl (2&#8201;a&#8208;Cl), Br (2&#8201;a&#8208;Br)], arising from facile Markovnikov addition of halide anions to the putative quinoidal cumulene cation [Ru(=C=C=C6H4=C=CH2)(PPh3)2Cp]+. Similarly, [M{C=C(H)&#8208;1,4&#8208;C6H4&#8208;C&#8801;CH}(LL)Cp ]BF4 [M(LL)Cp&#8217;=Ru(PPh3)2Cp ([1&#8201;a]BF4); Ru(dppe)Cp* ([1&#8201;b]BF4); Fe(dppe)Cp ([1&#8201;c]BF4); Fe(dppe)Cp* ([1&#8201;d]BF4)] react with H+/H2O to give the acyl&#8208;functionalised phenylacetylide complexes [M{C&#8801;C&#8208;1,4&#8208;C6H4&#8208;C(=O)CH3}(LL)Cp&#8217;] (3&#8201;a&#8211;d) after workup. The Markovnikov addition of the nucleophile to the remote alkyne in the cations [1&#8201;a&#8211;d]+ is difficult to rationalise from the vinylidene form of the precursor and is much more satisfactorily explained from initial isomerisation to the quinoidal cumulene complexes [M(=C=C=C6H4=C=CH2)(LL)Cp&#8217;]+ prior to attack at the more exposed, remote quaternary carbon. Thus, whilst representative acetylide complexes [Ru(C&#8801;C&#8208;1,4&#8208;C6H4&#8208;C&#8801;CH)(PPh3)2Cp] (4&#8201;a) and [Ru(C&#8801;C&#8208;1,4&#8208;C6H4&#8208;C&#8801;CH)(dppe)Cp*] (4&#8201;b) reacted with the relatively small electrophiles [CN]+ and [C7H7]+ at the &#946;&#8208;carbon to give the expected vinylidene complexes, the bulky trityl ([CPh3]+) electrophile reacted with [M(C&#8801;C&#8208;1,4&#8208;C6H4&#8208;C&#8801;CH)(LL)Cp&#8217;] [M(LL)Cp&#8217;=Ru(PPh3)2Cp (4&#8201;a); Ru(dppe)Cp* (4&#8201;b); Fe(dppe)Cp (4&#8201;c); Fe(dppe)Cp* (4&#8201;d)] at the more exposed remote end of the carbon&#8208;rich ligand to give the putative quinoidal cumulene complexes [M{C=C=C6H4=C=C(H)CPh3}(LL)Cp&#8217;]+, which were isolated as the water adducts [M{C&#8801;C&#8208;1,4&#8208;C6H4&#8208;C(=O)CH2CPh3}(LL)Cp&#8217;] (6&#8201;a&#8211;d).

      <title>Dirhodium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H Azidation of Benzaldehydes</title>
      <dc:description>
Double up: An efficient azidation method mediated by dirhodium(II) catalysts to achieve the direct aryl azidation of aromatic aldehydes is developed which avoids the use of protected aldehydes and prefunctionalized arenes. The mechanism studies indicate that the one&#8208;electron oxidative intermediate Rh2(II,III)N3 is responsible for the azide transfer. The regioselectivity of this method is similar to those of typical aromatic electrophilic substitution reactions.







Abstract
Multiple steps are needed to achieve the C&#8722;H functional of aromatic aldehyde, since the C&#8722;H functional reaction usually occurs preferentially at the aldehydic C&#8722;H bond over the aryl C&#8722;H bond. We report an efficient azidation method mediated by dirhodium(II) catalysts to achieve the direct aryl azidation of aromatic aldehydes avoiding the simultaneous use of protected aldehydes and prefunctionalized arenes. The regioselectivity of this method is similar to those of typical aromatic electrophilic substitution reactions. The resulting azidobenzaldehyde products are versatile building blocks or precursors for the synthesis of many biologically active compounds. The mechanism studies indicate that the one&#8208;electron oxidative intermediate Rh2(II,III)N3 is responsible for the azide transfer.

      <title>Cystobactamid 507: Concise Synthesis, Mode of Action, and Optimization toward More Potent Antibiotics</title>
      <dc:description>
Optimized cystobactamid antibiotics: MedChem optimization of the antibiotic cystobactamid 507 targeting DNA gyrase resulted in the construction of analogues with improved activity. Bioactive conformation was disclosed and the shortest synthetic route established. Mode of action studies revealed specific binding at the DNA minor groove. Incorporation of a tripeptidic cystobactamid 507 analogue into a hexapeptide resulted in superior activity.







Abstract
Lack of new antibiotics and increasing antimicrobial resistance are among the main concerns of healthcare communities nowadays, and these concerns necessitate the search for novel antibacterial agents. Recently, we discovered the cystobactamids&#8212;a novel natural class of antibiotics with broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activity. In this work, we describe 1)&#8197;a concise total synthesis of cystobactamid 507, 2)&#8197;the identification of the bioactive conformation using noncovalently bonded rigid analogues, and 3)&#8197;the first structure&#8211;activity relationship (SAR) study for cystobactamid 507 leading to new analogues with high metabolic stability, superior topoisomerase IIA inhibition, antibacterial activity and, importantly, stability toward the resistant factor AlbD. Deeper insight into the mode of action revealed that the cystobactamids employ DNA minor&#8208;groove binding as part of the drug&#8211;target interaction without showing significant intercalation. By designing a new analogue of cystobactamid 919&#8208;2, we finally demonstrated that these findings could be further exploited to obtain more potent hexapeptides against Gram&#8208;negative bacteria.

      <title>Periodicity of Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet Behaviour of Heterotetranuclear Lanthanide Complexes across the Lanthanide Series: A Compendium</title>
      <dc:description>
Divergent trend: The dynamics of single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) behaviour modulated by heterometallic bonding interaction axial to the lanthanide (Ln) ion was investigated holistically in acetato&#8208;bridged tetranuclear Pd&#8211;Ln complexes for the whole lanthanide series by experimental and theoretical methods. A unique trend with divergence depending on whether the ion is Kramers or non&#8208;Kramers was observed across the series.







Abstract
Acetato&#8208;bridged palladium&#8211;lanthanide tetranuclear heterometallic complexes of the form [Pd2Ln2(H2O)2(CH3COO)10]&#8901;2&#8201;CH3COOH [Ln2=Ce2 (1), Pr2 (2), Nd2 (3), Sm2 (4), Tb2 (5), Dy2 (6), Dy0.2Y1.8 (6&#8242;&#8242;), Ho2 (7), Er2 (8), Er0.24Y1.7 (8&#8242;&#8242;), Tm2 (9), Yb2 (10), Y2(11)] were synthesised and characterised by experimental and theoretical techniques. All complexes containing Kramers lanthanide ions [Ln3+=Ce (1), Nd (3), Sm (4), Dy (6), DyY (6&#8242;&#8242;), Er (8), ErY (8&#8242;&#8242;), Yb (10)] showed field&#8208;induced slow magnetic relaxation, characteristic of single&#8208;molecule magnetism and purely of molecular origin. In contrast, all non&#8208;Kramers lanthanide ions [Ln3+=Pr (2), Tb (5), Ho (7), Tm (9), Y3+ (11) is diamagnetic and non&#8208;lanthanide] did not show any slow magnetic relaxation. The variation in the electronic structure and accompanying consequences across the complexes representing all Kramers and non&#8208;Kramers lanthanide ions were investigated. The origin of the magnetic properties and the extent to which the axial donor&#8211;acceptor interaction involving the lanthanide ions and an electron&#8208;deficient 
 orbital of palladium affects the observed magnetic and electronic properties across the lanthanide series are presented. Unique consistent electronic and magnetic properties of isostructural complexes spanning the lanthanide series with properties dependent on whether the ions are Kramers or non&#8208;Kramers are reported.

      <title>Towards Molecular Design of Spin&#8208;Crossover Complexes of 2,6&#8208;Bis(pyrazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)Pyridines</title>
      <dc:description>
A counterintuitive ligand design to induce a spin&#8208;crossover in otherwise high&#8208;spin complexes was devised for 2,6&#8208;bis(pyrazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)pyridines by choosing bulky substituents, the ortho&#8208;functionalized phenyl groups. The tribute to a Russian avant&#8208;garde artist Kazimir Malevich in the artwork shows it as a traditional &#8216;tool&#8217; to set the right balance between the shape and the size of these substituents to move towards a truly molecular design of spin&#8208;crossover compounds for future breakthrough applications.

      <title>Sr3P3N7: Complementary Approach by Ammonothermal and High&#8208;Pressure Syntheses</title>
      <dc:description>
Nitridophosphates: A complementary approach of medium&#8208; and high&#8208;pressure methods with their respective advantages was used for the synthesis of Sr3P3N7, indicating this strategy as promising for further investigation of novel nitridophosphates. Upon doping with Eu2+, Sr3P3N7 exhibits luminescence in the deep&#8208;red region.







Abstract
Nitridophosphates exhibit an intriguing structural diversity with different structural motifs, for example, chains, layers or frameworks. In this contribution the novel nitridophosphate Sr3P3N7 with unprecedented dreier double chains is presented. Crystalline powders were synthesized using the ammonothermal method, while single crystals were obtained by a high&#8208;pressure multianvil technique. The crystal structure of Sr3P3N7 was solved and refined from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and confirmed by powder X&#8208;ray methods. Sr3P3N7 crystallizes in monoclinic space group P2/c. Energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray and Fourier&#8208;transformed infrared spectroscopy were conducted to confirm the chemical composition, as well as the absence of NHx functionality. The optical band gap was estimated to be 4.4&#8197;eV using diffuse reflectance UV/Vis spectroscopy. Upon doping with Eu2+, Sr3P3N7 shows a broad deep&#8208;red to infrared emission (&#955;em=681&#8197;nm, fwhm&#8776;3402&#8197;cm&#8722;1) with an internal quantum efficiency of 42&#8201;%.

      <title>Room Temperature Coupling of Aryldiazoacetates with Boronic Acids Enhanced by Blue Light Irradiation</title>
      <dc:description>
A room temperature protocol for the coupling between aryldiazoacetates and boronic acids is described, exhibiting limited scope in the dark, but being significantly improved under blue&#8208;light irradiation. An intricate mechanistic scenario reveals common aspects for both processes, both relying on the generation of a key carbene intermediate, which attacks the boronic acid partner. These features are represented in the illustration by the yin yang symbol and the starships. More information can be found in the Full Paper by I.&#8197;D. Jurberg et&#8197;al.

      <title>Recent Progress of P2&#8208;Type Layered Transition&#8208;Metal Oxide Cathodes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Seeking suitable structures: The P2&#8208;type layered transition&#8208;metal oxides (NaxTMO2, TM=transition&#8208;metal element), as cathodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), have potential for large&#8208;scale commercial applications. Herein, structural evolution, anionic redox reactions, some challenges, and recent progress of the application of NaxTMO2 cathodes for SIBs are reviewed and summarized.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted much attention due to their abundance, easy accessibility, and low cost. All of these advantages make them potential candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage. The P2&#8208;type layered transition&#8208;metal oxides (NaxTMO2; TM=Mn, Co, Ni, Ti, Fe, V, Cr, and a mixture of multiple elements) exhibit good Na+ ion conductivity and structural stability, which make them an excellent choice for the cathode materials of SIBs. Herein, the structural evolution, anionic redox reaction, some challenges, and recent progress of NaxTMO2 cathodes for SIBs are reviewed and summarized. Moreover, a detailed understanding of the relationship of chemical components, structures, phase compositions, and electrochemical performance is presented. This Review aims to provide a reference for the development of P2&#8208;type layered transition&#8208;metal oxide cathode materials for SIBs.

      <title>Facile Access to Dative, Single, and Double Silicon&#8722;Metal Bonds Through M&#8722;Cl Insertion Reactions of Base&#8208;Stabilized SiII Cations</title>
      <dc:description>
A facile access route to Si&#8594;M, Si&#8722;M, and Si=M (M=Ru, Rh) moieties through the insertion of NHC&#8208;stabilized silyliumylidene ions into metal&#8722;chloride bonds and subsequent reductive dehalogenation is reported. The coordination&#8211;insertion&#8211;migration mechanism was investigated theoretically and verified experimentally through NMR and XRD characterization of the intermediate silyliumylidene transition&#8208;metal coordination complexes.







Abstract
Silicon(II) cations can offer fascinating reactivity patterns due to their unique electronic structure: a lone pair of electrons, two empty p orbitals and a positive charge combined on a single silicon center. We now report the facile insertion of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;stabilized silyliumylidene ions into M&#8722;Cl bonds (M=Ru, Rh), forming a series of novel chlorosilylene transition&#8208;metal complexes. Theoretical investigations revealed a reaction mechanism in which the insertion into the M&#8722;Cl bond with concomitant 1,2&#8208;migration of a silicon&#8208;bound NHC to the transition metal takes place after formation of an initial silyliumylidene transition&#8208;metal complex. The mechanism could be verified experimentally through characterization of the intermediate complexes. Furthermore, the obtained chlorosilylene complexes can be conveniently utilized as synthons to access Si&#8722;M and Si=M bonding motifs bonds through reductive dehalogenation.

      <title>Organogermanium(II) Hydrides as a Source of Highly Soluble LiH</title>
      <dc:description>
Soluble lithium hydride source: The reduction of C=Y polar bonds by RLi in the presence of monomeric germanium hydride is possible. The combination of PhLi with L(H)Ge&#8901;BH3 yielded (Li(THF)2{BH3[L(H)GePh]})2 (3), which acts as a source of LiH for the reduction of benzaldehyde in non&#8208;polar solvents. The reaction proceeds via intermediate 3INT accompanied by the elimination of neutral complex L(Ph)Ge&#8901;BH3 (6).







Abstract
The reactions of monomeric C,N&#8208;chelated organogermanium(II) hydride L(H)Ge&#8901;BH3 with organolithium salts RLi yielded lithium hydrogermanatoborates (Li(THF)2{BH3[L(H)GeR]})2. Compound (Li(THF)2{BH3[L(H)GePh]})2 was used as a source of LiH for the reduction of organic C=O or C=N bonds in nonpolar solvents accompanied by the elimination of a neutral complex L(Ph)Ge&#8901;BH3. The interaction of (Li(THF)2{BH3[L(H)GePh]})2 with the polar C=O bond was further investigated by computational studies revealing a plausible geometry of a pre&#8208;reactive intermediate. The experimental and theoretical studies suggest that, although the Li atom of (Li(THF)2{BH3[L(H)GePh]})2 coordinates the C=O bond, the GeH fragment is the active species in the reduction reaction. Finally, benzaldehyde was reduced by a mixture of L(H)Ge&#8901;BH3 with PhLi in nonpolar solvents.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Soluble lithium hydride source&lt;/b&gt;: The reduction of C=Y polar bonds by RLi in the presence of monomeric germanium hydride is possible. The combination of PhLi with L(H)Ge&lt;b&gt;&#8901;&lt;/b&gt;BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yielded (Li(THF)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[L(H)GePh]})&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), which acts as a source of LiH for the reduction of benzaldehyde in non&#8208;polar solvents. The reaction proceeds via intermediate &lt;b&gt;3INT&lt;/b&gt; accompanied by the elimination of neutral complex L(Ph)Ge&lt;b&gt;&#8901;&lt;/b&gt;BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;).

&lt;p&gt;The reactions of monomeric C,N&#8208;chelated organogermanium(II) hydride L(H)Ge&lt;b&gt;&#8901;&lt;/b&gt;BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with organolithium salts RLi yielded lithium hydrogermanatoborates (Li(THF)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[L(H)GeR]})&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Compound (Li(THF)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[L(H)GePh]})&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was used as a source of LiH for the reduction of organic C=O or C=N bonds in nonpolar solvents accompanied by the elimination of a neutral complex L(Ph)Ge&lt;b&gt;&#8901;&lt;/b&gt;BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The interaction of (Li(THF)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[L(H)GePh]})&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with the polar C=O bond was further investigated by computational studies revealing a plausible geometry of a pre&#8208;reactive intermediate. The experimental and theoretical studies suggest that, although the Li atom of (Li(THF)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[L(H)GePh]})&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; coordinates the C=O bond, the GeH fragment is the active species in the reduction reaction. Finally, benzaldehyde was reduced by a mixture of L(H)Ge&lt;b&gt;&#8901;&lt;/b&gt;BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with PhLi in nonpolar solvents.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hierarchical Tubular Architecture Constructed by Vertically Aligned CoS2&#8208;MoS2 Nanosheets for Hydrogen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
Tubular sheets: CoS2&#8208;MoS2 nanosheets assembles with a hierarchical tubular architecture are fabricated through a facile metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOF)&#8208;intermediated self&#8208;templated hydrothermal strategy. With the advantages of the hierarchical hollow structure and the uniformly dispersed active sites, the well&#8208;defined sample of Pd&#8208;CoS2&#8208;MoS2/C&#8208;600 exhibits enhanced electrocatalysis performance toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic medium.







Abstract
Developing efficient electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is crucial for establishing a sustainable and environmentally friendly energy system, but it is still a challenging issue. Herein, hierarchical tubular&#8208;structured CoS2&#8208;MoS2/C as efficient electrocatalysts are fabricated through a unique metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) mediated self&#8208;sacrificial templating. Core&#8211;shell structured MoO3@ZIF&#8208;67 nanorods are used both as a precursor and a sacrificial template to form the one&#8208;dimensional tubular heterostructure where vertically aligned two&#8208;dimensional CoS2&#8208;MoS2 nanosheets are formed on the MOF&#8208;derived carbon tube. Trace amounts of noble metals (Pd, Rh, and Ru) are successfully introduced to enhance the electrocatalytic property of the CoS2&#8208;MoS2/C nanocomposites. The as&#8208;synthesized hierarchical tubular heterostructures exhibit excellent HER catalytic performance owing to the merits of the hierarchical hollow architecture with abundantly exposed edges and the uniformly dispersed active sites. Impressively, the optimal Pd&#8208;CoS2&#8208;MoS2/C&#8208;600 catalyst delivers a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a low overpotential of 144&#8197;mV and a small Tafel slope of 59.9&#8197;mV/dec in 0.5&#8201;m H2SO4. Overall, this MOF&#8208;mediated strategy can be extended to the rational design and synthesis of other hollow heterogeneous catalysts for scalable hydrogen generation.

The obtained aza[8]circulenes  3a  and  3b  were easily oxidized to give their radical cations  3a  +  and  3b  +  , which are highly stable under ambient conditions. X&#8208;Ray diffraction analysis of radical cation  3a  +  showed a face&#8208;to&#8208;face dimer arrangement with an interplanar separation of 3.320 &#197;. The spin density of  3a  +  was calculated to be delocalized over the whole circulene &#960;&#8208;systems with spin&#8208;spin exchange integral (  J  = &#8211;144 cm  &#8211;1  ) in the dimeric part.

      <title>APEX strategy represented by Diels&#8208;Alder cycloadditions &#8211; new opportunities for the syntheses of functionalised PAHs</title>
      <dc:description>Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition of various dienophiles to PAHs bay region is particularly effective and useful tool for PAHs structure and finally properties modification. It is due to the fact that Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition belongs to single&#8208;step Annulative &#960;&#8208;Extension (APEX) reactions and represents the maximum in synthetic efficiency for the constructions of &#960;&#8208;extended PAHs including functionalised ones, nanographenes, and &#960;&#8208;extended fused heteroarenes. Herein we report new applications of APEX strategy for the synthesis of derivatives of 1,2&#8208;diarylbenzo[ghi]perylene, 1,2&#8208;diarylbenzo[ghi]perylenebisimide and 1,2&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;benzo[j]coronene. Namely, so far unknown cycloaddition of 1,2&#8208;diarylacetylenes into perylene and perylenebisimides bay region was used. 1,2&#8208;Disubstituted&#8208;benzo[j]coronenes were obtained via cycloaddition of benzyne into 1,2&#8208;diarylbenzo[ghi]perylenes using a new highly effective system for benzyne generation and/or high pressure conditions. Moreover, we report unprecedented Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition&#8208;cycloaromatisation domino&#8208;type reaction between 1,4&#8208;(9,9&#8208;dialkylfluoren&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiynes and perylene.

      <title>Library Design Strategies to Accelerate&#160;Fragment&#8208;Based Drug Discovery</title>
      <dc:description>Fragment&#8208;based drug discovery (FBDD) has become an established approach for the generation of early lead candidates. However, despite its success and inherent advantages, hit&#8208;to&#8208;candidate progression for FBDD is not necessarily faster than for the traditional high&#8208;throughput screening. Thus, new technology&#8208;driven library design strategies have emerged as a means to facilitate more efficient fragment screening and/or subsequent fragment&#8208;to&#8208;hit chemistry. This minireview will discuss such strategies, which cover the use of labelled fragments for NMR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallographic screening of specialized fragments, covalent linkage for mass spectrometry, dynamic combinatorial chemistry, and fragments optimized for easy elaboration.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fragment&#8208;based drug discovery (FBDD) has become an established approach for the generation of early lead candidates. However, despite its success and inherent advantages, hit&#8208;to&#8208;candidate progression for FBDD is not necessarily faster than for the traditional high&#8208;throughput screening. Thus, new technology&#8208;driven library design strategies have emerged as a means to facilitate more efficient fragment screening and/or subsequent fragment&#8208;to&#8208;hit chemistry. This minireview will discuss such strategies, which cover the use of labelled fragments for NMR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallographic screening of specialized fragments, covalent linkage for mass spectrometry, dynamic combinatorial chemistry, and fragments optimized for easy elaboration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A Systematic Study of Coumarin&#8208;Tetrazine Light&#8208;Up Probes for Bioorthogonal Fluorescence Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>Fluorescent probes that light&#8208;up in reaction with complementary bioorthogonal reagents are superior tools for no&#8208;wash fluorogenic bioimaging applications. Herein, we present a thorough study on a set of seventeen structurally diverse coumarin&#8208;tetrazine probes that produce fluorescent dyes with exceptional turn&#8208;on ratios when reacted with  trans  &#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) and bicyclononyne (BCN) dienophiles. In general, formation of the fully aromatic pyridazine&#8208;containing dyes resulting from the reaction with BCN was found superior in terms of fluorogenicity. However, evaluation of the probes in cellular imaging experiments revealed that other factors such as reaction kinetics and good cell permeability prevail over the fluorescence turn&#8208;on properties. The best compound identified in this study showed excellent performance in live cell labeling experiments and enabled no&#8208;wash fluorogenic imaging at the timescale of seconds.</dc:description>

      <title>New Visible Light&#8208;triggered Photocatalytic Trifluoromethylation Reactions of Carbon&#8208;carbon Multiple Bonds and (Hetero)aromatic Compounds</title>
      <dc:description>Visible&#8208;light&#8208;photocatalyzed methods employed in synthetic transformations present attractive properties such as environmentally friendly, safety, availability and excellent functional group tolerance. In this venue, research on the visible&#8208;light photocatalytic incorporation of the trifluoromethyl CF  3  moiety into organic substrates, in particular, has contributed to a clear evolution of the very field of photocatalysis. Although this particular area is constantly evolving and reviewed, the last five years have experienced an outburst of seminal and significant photocatalytic trifluoromethylation examples that are leading the way and opening new synthetic avenues. Recent review articles on Ru&#8208; and Ir&#8208; based photocatalytic trifluoromethylation reactions have borne witness of this evolution. Although this account will show the new Ru&#8208; and Ir&#8208;based photocatalytic trifluoromethylations, Sections 2 and 3 will also illustrate &#160;other photocatalytic systems, such as organic dyes, organic semiconductors and newly&#8208;developed all&#8208;organic photocatalysts. All the known and reviewed strategies for photocatalytic trifluoromethylation reactions of olefins and (hetero)aromatic compounds will not be discussed but will be summarized in two Figures (Figures 4 and 5), and new examples (2015&#8208;present) will be presented and discussed.</dc:description>

The reaction mechanism features a multi&#8208;component reaction consisting of electron&#8208;rich arenes, an alcohol of choice and excess SO  2  in an acetonitrile&#8208;HFIP reaction mixture. In&#8208;situ formed monoalkyl sulfites are considered as key intermediate with bifunctional purpose. Firstly, this species functions as nucleophile and secondly, excellent conductivity is provided. Several primary and secondary alcohols and electron&#8208;rich arenes are implemented in this reaction to form the alkyl arylsulfonates in yields up to 73% with exquisite selectivity. Boron&#8208;doped diamond electrodes (BDD) are employed in divided cells, separated by a simple commercially available glass frit.</dc:description>

      <title>Unique Role of Heterole&#8208;fused Structures in Aromaticity and Physicochemical Properties in 7,8&#8208;Dehydropurpurins</title>
      <dc:description>Porphyrins with a fused five&#8208;membered ring such as 7,8&#8208;dehydropurpurins have appeared as an emerging class of unique porphyrinoids. Their altered absorption spectra, relatively short lifetimes of excited states, and small HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps arise from the harmony of antiaromatic 20&#960;&#8208;circuit and aromatic 18&#960;&#8208;circuit. In this regard, the electronic properties of 7,8&#8208;dehydropurpurins are expected to be controlled by modulating the contribution of antiaromatic &#960;&#8208;circuit to the whole aromaticity. Here we report the comparison of pyrrole&#8208; and phosphole&#8208;fused 7,8&#8208;dehydropurpurins in terms of their aromaticity and physicochemical properties. The spectroscopic investigation revealed the larger contribution of antiaromatic 24&#960;&#8208;circuit in pyrrole&#8208;fused 7,8&#8208;dehyrdopurpurins than phosphole&#8208;fused 7,8&#8208;dehydropurpurins. The DFT calculations also supported the feasibility of tuning the aromaticity of 7,8&#8208;dehydropurpurins by heterole&#8208;fused structures. Thus, the introduction of heterole&#8208;fused structures into porphyrinoids is a universal strategy to get new insight into aromaticity and their intrinsic properties in cyclic &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules.</dc:description>

      <title>Evidence for Genuine Bimetallic Frustrated Lewis Pair Activation of Dihydrogen with Gold(I)/Platinum(0) Systems</title>
      <dc:description>
Introducing transition&#8208;metal elements into frustrated Lewis pairs has emerged as a promising approach to develop new cooperative catalysts. Based on the heterolytic splitting of H2 by AuI/Pt0 combinations, this work reports the first system for which genuine bimetallic frustration has been demonstrated. This joint experimental/computational effort evinces the importance of balancing the degree of frustration versus M&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;M interaction to enhance small&#8208;molecule activation.

      <title>Gold Redox Catalysis with a Selenium Cation as a Mild Oxidant</title>
      <dc:description>
Diselenide is demonstrated to function as a mild oxidant in gold&#8208;catalyzed alkyne diselenation reactions, which overcome the daunting high AuI/III redox potential (1.4&#8197;eV) depicted in the cover image as a &#8216;golden roller coaster&#8217;. Excellent trans&#8208; regioselectivity and good to excellent yields were achieved with a wide range of alkynes and allenes.

The fluorescence of HBDI (the dark green molecules in the lower part of the picture), the chromophore of a naturally occurring green fluorescence protein (GFP) in the jellyfish Aequorea Victoria, is turned on upon forming an H&#8208;type aggregate (the structure in the upper part of the picture) via the hydrogen bonding of the chromophores and the gelators (the two terminal parts of the H&#8208;aggregate).

      <title>Newly designed durable electrolyte for high voltage lithium ion batteries and mechanism analysis</title>
      <dc:description>Rechargeable lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) have dominated the energy market from electronic devices to electric vehicles, but pursuing greater energy density remains challenging due to the limited electrode capacity. Although increasing the cut&#8208;off voltage of LIBs (&gt;4.4V vs. Li+/Li) can enhance the energy density, the aggravated electrolyte decomposition always leads to a severe capacity fading and/or expiry of battery. Herein, we present a new durable electrolyte for high voltage LIBs. The designed electrolyte is composed of mixed linear alkyl carbonate solvent with certain cyclic carbonate additives, in which the ethylene carbonate (EC) co&#8208;solvent was successfully avoided in use to suppress the electrolyte decomposition. As a result, an extremely high cycling stability, rate capability and high&#8208;temperature storage performance were demonstrated in the case of graphite | LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622) battery at 4.45 V when such electrolyte was used. We confirm that the good compatibility of electrolyte with graphite anode and the mitigated structural degradation of NCM622 cathode are responsible for the high performance at the high potential above 4.4 V. This work presents the promising applications of high voltage electrolytes for pursuing high energy LIBs and provides a straightforward guideline to study the electrodes&#8208;electrolyte interface for higher stability.</dc:description>

      <title>Self&#8208;Metalation of Anchored Porphyrins on Atomically&#8208;Defined Cobalt Oxide Surfaces: In&#8208;situ Studies by Surface Vibrational Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>Metalation of anchored porphyrins is essential for their functionality at hybrid interfaces. In this work, we have studied the anchoring and metalation of a functionalized porphyrin derivative, 5&#8209;(4&#8209;carboxyphenyl)&#8208;10,15,20&#8208;triphenylporphyrin (MCTPP), on an atomically&#8208;defined CoO(100) film under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions. We follow both the anchoring to the oxide surface and the self&#8208;metalation by surface Co  2+  ions via infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS).
At 150&#160;K, MCTPP multilayer films adsorb molecularly on CoO(100) without anchoring to the surface. Upon heating to 200&#160;K, the first layer of porphyrin molecules anchors via formation of a bridging surface carboxylate. Above 460&#160;K, the MCTPP multilayer desorbs and only the anchored monolayer resides on the surface up to temperatures of 600&#160;K approximately. The orientation of anchored MCTPP depends on the surface coverage. At low coverage, the MCTPP adopts a nearly flat&#8208;lying geometry, whereas an upright standing film is formed near the multilayer coverage.
Self&#8208;metalation of MCTPP depends critically on the surface temperature, the coverage and on the molecular orientation. At 150&#160;K, metalation is largely suppressed, while the degree of metalation increases with increasing temperature and reaches a value of around 60% in the first monolayer at 450&#160;K. At lower coverage higher metalation fractions (85% and above) are observed, similar as for increasing temperature.</dc:description>

      <title>Alkyl Chain Length&#8208; and Polymorph&#8208;Dependent photomechanochromic fluorescence of anthracene photodimerization in molecular crystals: roles of the lattice stiffness</title>
      <dc:description>An anthracene&#8208;pentiptycene hybrid system ( 1&#8208;C n  , where n  refers to the number of carbon atom in the linear alkyl chain) crystalizes in three different polymorphs, called Y (yellow), G (green), and B (blue) forms in terms of the fluorescence color. While all the Y&#8208;form crystals perform the same yellow&#8208;to&#8208;blue fluorescence color responses to the photomechanical stress generated by the antrhacene [4+4] photodimerization reaction, the four G forms display distinct photomechanofluorochromism (PMFC): namely, from green to blue for G&#8208;1&#8208;C4  , to orange for G&#8208;1&#8208;C7  , to red for G&#8208;1&#8208;C8  , and to red then blue for G&#8208;1&#8208;C9  , and there is no photochromic activity for the B forms. The intriguing RGB three&#8208;color PMFC and the abnormal topochemical reactivity of G&#8208;1&#8208;C9 are attributed to an inherent softness of the crystal lattice.</dc:description>

      <title>pH&#8208;Dependent Slipping and Exfoliation of Layered Covalent Organic Framework</title>

      <title>Homochiral Covalent Organic Frameworks for Asymmetric Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Owing to their permanent porosity, high&#8208;ordered and extended structure, good chemical stability and tuneability, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as a new type of organic materials that can offer various applications in different fields. Benefiting from the huge database of organic reactions, the required functionality of COFs can be readily achieved by modification of the corresponding organic functional groups on either polymerizable monomers or established COF frameworks. This striking feature allows us to reasonably design and synthesize homochiral COFs (HCCOFs), furthermore, use them as a unique platform to fabricate asymmetric catalysts. This contribution provides an overview of new progress in HCCOFs&#8208;based asymmetric catalysis, including design, synthesis and their application in asymmetric organic synthesis. Moreover, major challenges and developing trends in this field are also discussed. We anticipate that this review article will provide some new insights into HCCOFs for heterogeneous asymmetric catalysis, furthermore, help encourage further contributions in this young but promising field.</dc:description>

      <title>Meticulous Doxorubicin Release from pH&#8208;responsive Nanoparticles Entrapped within an Injectable Thermoresponsive Depot.</title>
      <dc:description>The dual stimuli&#8208;controlled release of doxorubicin from gel&#8208;embedded nanoparticles is reported. Non&#8208;cytotoxic polymer nanoparticles are formed from poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;  b  &#8208;poly(benzyl glutamate) that, uniquely, contain a central ester link. This connection renders the nanoparticles pH&#8208;responsive, enabling extensive doxorubicin release in acidic solutions (pH 6.5), but not in solutions of physiological pH (pH 7.4). Doxorubicin loaded nanoparticles were found to be stable for at least 31 days and lethal against the three breast cancer cell lines tested. Furthermore, doxorubicin loaded nanoparticles could be incorporated within a thermoresponsive poly(2&#8208;hydroxypropyl methacrylate) gel depot, which forms immediately upon injection of poly(2&#8208;hydroxypropyl methacrylate) in DMSO solution into aqueous solution. The combination of the poly(2&#8208;hydroxypropyl methacrylate) gel and poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;  b  &#8208;poly(benzyl glutamate) nanoparticles yields an injectable doxorubicin delivery system that facilities near&#8208;complete drug release when maintained at elevated temperatures (37 &#176;C) in acidic solution (pH 6.5). In contrast, negligible payload release occurs when the material is stored at room temperature in non&#8208;acidic solution (pH 7.4).

      <title>Toward understanding the enhanced pseudocapacitive storage in 3D SnS/MXene architecture enabled by engineered surface reactions</title>
      <dc:description>The optimization of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) MXene&#8208;based electrodes with desired electrochemical performances is highly demanded. Here, we report a precursor&#8208;guided strategy for fabricating 3D SnS/MXene architecture with tiny SnS nanocrystals (~ 5 nm in size) covalently decorated on wrinkled Ti3C2Tx nanosheets via Ti&#8208;S bonds (denoted as SnS/Ti3C2Tx&#8208;O). The formation of Ti&#8208;S bonds between SnS and Ti3C2Tx was confirmed by extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). Rather than bulky SnS plates decorated on Ti3C2Tx (SnS/Ti3C2Tx&#8208;H) by one&#8208;step hydrothermal sulfidation followed by post annealing, our SnS/Ti3C2Tx&#8208;O presents size&#8208;dependent structural and dynamic properties. The as&#8208;formed 3D hierarchical structure can provide short ion&#8208;diffusion pathways and electron transport distance because of more accessible surface sites. In addition, benefiting from the tiny SnS nanocrystals that can effectively improve Na+ diffusion and suppress structural variation upon charge/discharge processes, our as&#8208;obtained SnS/Ti3C2Tx&#8208;O can generate pseudocapacitance&#8208;dominated storage behavior enabled by engineered surface reactions. As predicted, this electrode exhibits enhanced Na storage capacity of 565 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 A g&#8208;1 after 75 cycles, outperforming SnS/Ti3C2Tx&#8208;H (336 mAh g&#8208;1), SnS (212 mAh g&#8208;1) and Ti3C2Tx (104 mAh g&#8208;1) electrodes.</dc:description>

      <title>Rational Design of Azothiophenes &#8211; Substitution Effects on the Switching Properties</title>
      <dc:description>A series of substituted azothiophenes was prepared and investigated toward their isomerization behavior.

      <title>Synthesis, Photophysical and Electronic Properties of Mono&#8208;, Di&#8208;, Tri&#8208;Amino&#8208;Substituted Ortho&#8208;Perylenes, and Comparison to the Tetra&#8208;Substituted Derivative</title>
      <dc:description>We synthesized a series of new mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted perylene derivatives with strong bis(  para  &#8208;methoxyphenyl)amine (DPA) donors at the uncommon 2,5,8,11&#8208;positions. The properties of our new donor&#8208;substituted perylenes were studied in detail to establish a structure&#8208;property relationship. Interesting trends and unusual properties are observed for this series of new perylene derivatives, such as a decreasing charge transfer (CT) character with increasing number of DPA moieties and individual reversible oxidations for each DPA moiety. Thus,  (DPA)&#8208;Per  possesses one reversible oxidation while  (DPA)  4  &#8208;Per  has four. The mono&#8208; and di&#8208;substituted derivatives display unusually large Stokes shifts not previously reported for perylenes. Furthermore, transient absorption measurements of the new derivatives reveal an excited state with lifetimes of several hundred microseconds, which sensitizes singlet oxygen with quantum yields of up to 0.83.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We synthesized a series of new mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted perylene derivatives with strong bis(  para  &#8208;methoxyphenyl)amine (DPA) donors at the uncommon 2,5,8,11&#8208;positions. The properties of our new donor&#8208;substituted perylenes were studied in detail to establish a structure&#8208;property relationship. Interesting trends and unusual properties are observed for this series of new perylene derivatives, such as a decreasing charge transfer (CT) character with increasing number of DPA moieties and individual reversible oxidations for each DPA moiety. Thus,  (DPA)&#8208;Per  possesses one reversible oxidation while  (DPA)  4  &#8208;Per  has four. The mono&#8208; and di&#8208;substituted derivatives display unusually large Stokes shifts not previously reported for perylenes. Furthermore, transient absorption measurements of the new derivatives reveal an excited state with lifetimes of several hundred microseconds, which sensitizes singlet oxygen with quantum yields of up to 0.83.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Modulation of Self&#8208;Separating Molecular Catalysts for Highly Efficient Biomass Transformations</title>
      <dc:description>The energetically viable fabrication of stable and highly efficient solid acid catalysts is one of the key steps in the large&#8208;scale transformation processes of biomass resources. Herein, we report the covalent modification of the classical Dawson polyoxometalate (POMs) with sulphonic acids (&#8210;SO3H) by grafting the sulfonic acid groups on the POM&#8217;s surface followed by oxidation of (3&#8208;Mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane. The acidity of TBA6&#8208;P2W17&#8208;SO3H (TBA = tetrabutyl ammonium) has been demonstrated using 31P.NMR, clearly indicating the presence of strong Br&#248;nsted acid sites. The presence of TBA counterions renders the solid acid catalyst as a promising candidate for phase transfer catalytic processes. The TBA6&#8208;P2W17&#8208;SO3H shows remarkable activity and selectivity, excellent stability and great substrate compatibility for the esterification of free fatty acids (FFA) with methanol and conversion into biodiesel at 70 &#176;C with &gt;98% conversion of oleic acid in 20 min. The excellent catalytic performance can be attributed to the formation of a catalytically active emulsion, which results in a uniform catalytic behavior during the reaction leading to efficient interaction between the substrate and the active sites of the catalyst. Most importantly, the catalyst can be easily recovered and reused without any loss of its catalytic activity due to its excellent phase transfer properties. This work offers an efficient and cost&#8208;effective strategy for large scale biomass conversion applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Tetracationic Bis&#8208;Triarylborane 1,3&#8208;Butadiyne as a Combined Fluorimetric and Raman Probe for Simultaneous and Selective Sensing of Various DNA, RNA, and Proteins</title>
      <dc:description>
Got the link? Linking two dicationic triarylborane units by Raman&#8208;responsive 1,3&#8208;butadiyne yielded a triple&#8208;action probe: fluorimetric and SERS sensing of ds&#8208;DNA, RNA and proteins, as well as circular dichroism sensing of ss&#8208;RNA (see figure).







Abstract
A bis&#8208;triarylborane tetracation (4&#8208;Ar2B&#8208;3,5&#8208;Me2C6H2)&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8208;(3,5&#8208;Me2C6H2&#8208;4&#8208;BAr2 [Ar=(2,6&#8208;Me2&#8208;4&#8208;NMe3&#8208;C6H2)+] (24+) shows distinctly different behaviour in its fluorimetric response than that of our recently published bis&#8208;triarylborane 5&#8208;(4&#8208;Ar2B&#8208;3,5&#8208;Me2C6H2)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;(C4H2S)2&#8211;5&#8242;&#8208;(3,5&#8208;Me2C6H2&#8208;4&#8208;BAr2) (34+). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data on the neutral bis&#8208;triarylborane precursor 2&#8201;N confirm its rod&#8208;like dumbbell structure, which is shown to be important for DNA/RNA targeting and also for BSA protein binding. Fluorimetric titrations with DNA/RNA/BSA revealed the very strong affinity of 24+ and indicated the importance of the properties of the linker connecting the two triarylboranes. Using the butadiyne rather than a bithiophene linker resulted in an opposite emission effect (quenching vs. enhancement), and 24+ bound to BSA 100&#8197;times stronger than 34+. Moreover, 24+ interacted strongly with ss&#8208;RNA, and circular dichroism (CD) results suggest ss&#8208;RNA chain&#8208;wrapping around the rod&#8208;like bis&#8208;triarylborane dumbbell structure like a thread around a spindle, a very unusual mode of binding of ss&#8208;RNA with small molecules. Furthermore, 24+ yielded strong Raman/SERS signals, allowing DNA or protein detection at ca. 10&#8197;nm concentrations. The above observations, combined with low cytotoxicity, efficient human cell uptake and organelle&#8208;selective accumulation make such compounds intriguing novel lead structures for bio&#8208;oriented, dual fluorescence/Raman&#8208;based applications.

Highly&#8208;reduced Ni pre&#8208;catalyst: Dilithiumbis(cyloocta&#8208;1,5&#8208;diene)nickelate(&#8722;II) enables the hydrogenation of C=C double bonds. The mild conditions tolerate various functional groups. Mechanistic studies, including reaction progress analyses, poisoning experiments, and multinuclear NMR monitoring, indicate that the molecular Ni&#8722;II complex is a precursor to a heterotopic Ni nanoparticle catalyst.







Abstract
The hydrogenation of olefins, styrenes, enoates, imines, and sterically hindered tri&#8208;substituted olefins was accomplished using the pre&#8208;catalyst dilithiumbis(cycloocta&#8208;1,5&#8208;diene)nickelate(&#8722;II) (1). The mild conditions tolerate hydroxyl, halide, ester, and lactone functionalities. Mechanistic studies, including reaction progress analyses, poisoning experiments, and multinuclear NMR monitoring, indicate that a heterotopic (nickel nanoparticle) catalyst is in operation.

Abstract
Combining biological and small&#8208;molecule catalysts under a chemoenzymatic manifold presents a series of significant advantages to the synthetic community. We report herein the successful development of a two&#8208;step/single flask synthesis of &#947;&#8208;lactones through the merger of Umpolung catalysis with a ketoreductase&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution, reduction, and cyclization. This combined approach delivers highly enantio&#8208; and diastereoenriched heterocycles and demonstrates the feasibility of integrating NHC catalysis with enzymatic processes.

      <title>A Mechanistic Dichotomy in Two&#8208;Electron Reduction of Dioxygen Catalyzed by N,N&#8217;&#8208;Dimethylated Porphyrin Isomers</title>
      <dc:description>Selective two&#8208;electron reduction of dioxygen (O  2  ) to hydrogen peroxide (H  2  O  2  ) has been achieved by two saddle&#8208;distorted  N  ,  N  &#8217;&#8208;dimethylated porphyrin isomers, an  N  21,  N  &#8217;22&#8208;dimethylated porphyrin (  anti  &#8208;Me  2  P  ) and an  N  21,  N  &#8217;23&#8208;dimethylated porphyrin (  syn  &#8208;Me  2  P  ) as catalysts and ferrocene derivatives as electron donors in the presence of protic acids in acetonitrile. The higher catalytic performance in an oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was achieved by  anti  &#8208;Me  2  P  with higher turnover number (TON = 250 for 30 min) than that by  syn  &#8208;Me  2  P  (TON = 218 for 60 min). The reactive intermediates in the catalytic ORR were confirmed to be the corresponding isophlorins (  anti  &#8208;Me  2  Iph  or  syn  &#8208;Me  2  Iph  ) by spectroscopic measurements. The rate&#8208;determining step in the catalytic ORRs was concluded to be proton&#8208;coupled electron&#8208;transfer reduction of O  2  with isophlorins based on kinetic analysis. The ORR rate by  anti  &#8208;Me  2  Iph  was accelerated by external protons, judging from the dependence of the observed initial rates on acid concentrations. In contrast, no acceleration of the ORR rate with  syn  &#8208;Me  2  Iph  by external protons was observed. The different mechanisms in the O  2  reduction by the two isomers should be derived from that of the arrangement of hydrogen bonding of a O  2  with inner N  H  protons of the isophlorins.</dc:description>

      <title>Converting Poly(Methyl Methacrylate) into a Triple&#8208;Responsive Polymer</title>
      <dc:description>
Making PMMA responsive: PMMA can be converted into a triple&#8208;responsive polymer, being responsive to temperature, pH and CO2 gas, by a quantitative post&#8208;polymerization amidation with N,N&#8208;diethylethylenediamine. This will open access to a large variety of responsive macromolecular architectures, because this method can be applied to PMMA and PMMA&#8208;based block copolymers, being easily accessible by living anionic or controlled radical polymerization (see scheme).







Abstract
Multiresponsive polymers that can respond to several external stimuli are promising materials for a manifold of applications. Herein, a facile method for the synthesis of triple&#8208;responsive (pH, temperature, CO2) poly(N,N&#8208;diethylaminoethyl methacrylamide) by a post&#8208;polymerization amidation of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is presented. Combined with trivalent counterions ([Fe(CN)6]3&#8722;) both an upper and lower critical solution temperature (UCST/LCST)&#8208;type phase behavior can be realized at pH&#8197;8 and 9. PMMA and PMMA&#8208;based block copolymers are readily accessible by living anionic and controlled radical polymerization techniques, which opens access to various responsive polymer architectures based on the developed functionalization method. This method can also be applied on melt&#8208;processed bulk PMMA samples to introduce functional, responsive moieties at the PMMA surface.

      <title>Shape&#8208;selective Targeting on RNA Bulges by Peptidomimetic Metallohelices</title>
      <dc:description>RNA bulges represent one of the most common motifs in RNA secondary structure and serve in a variety of biological functions. Compounds stabilizing RNA bulges are important for probing RNA structure and function and therapy of some diseases. Here, we investigated the ability of a series of enantiomeric pairs of optically pure bimetallic metallohelices with different flexible linkers to target various RNA bulges. The results show that binding affinities of the metallohelices to bulged RNA differ and strongly depend on the size of the bulge and the base composition of the bulge loop. Notably, the shorter, more compact, and less flexible metallohelices bind to RNA bulges most efficiently and selectively. Interestingly, the ability of the metallohelices to bind to RNA bulges correlates with their previously reported antimicrobial activity, which suggests that the selective recognition of bulged regions in RNA by the metallohelices might also contribute to their biological activity.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The conformation of a molecule strongly affects its function, as demonstrated for peptides and nucleic acids. This correlation is much less established for carbohydrates, the most abundant organic materials in Nature. Recent advances in synthetic and analytical techniques have enabled the study of carbohydrates at the molecular level.

      <title>Multinuclear Pt(II) Complexes: Why Three is Better Than Two to Enhance Photophysical Properties</title>

      <title>Photocytotoxicity of Oligothienyl&#8208;functionalized Chelates that Sensitize LnIII Luminescence and Generate 1O2</title>
      <dc:description>Three new compounds containing a heptadentate lanthanide (LnIII) ion chelator functionalized with oligothiophenes,  nThept(COOH)4 ( n  =  1 ,  2, or  3 ), were isolated. Their LnIII complexes not only display the characteristic metal&#8208;centred emission in the visible or near&#8208;infrared (NIR) but also generate singlet oxygen (1O2). Luminescence efficiencies (&#981;Ln) for [Eu 1Thept(COO)4]&#8208; and [Eu 2Thept(COO)4]&#8208; are &#981;Eu = 3% and 0.5% in TRIS buffer and 33% and 3% in 95% ethanol, respectively.  3Thept(COO)44&#8208; does not sensitize EuIII emission due to its low&#8208;lying triplet state. NIR luminescence is observed for all NIR&#8208;emitting LnIII and ligands with efficiencies of &#981;Yb = 0.002%, 0.005% and 0.04% for [Yb nThept(COO)4]&#8208; ( n  =  1, 2, or 3), and &#981;Nd = 0.0007%, 0.002% and 0.02% for [Nd nThept(COO)4]&#8208; ( n  =  1, 2, or 3) in TRIS buffer. In 95% ethanol, quantum yields of NIR luminescence increase and are &#981;Yb = 0.5%, 0.31% and 0.05% for [Yb nThept(COO)4]&#8208; ( n  =  1, 2, or  3 ), and &#981;Nd = 0.40%, 0.45% and 0.12% for [Nd nThept(COO)4]&#8208; ( n  =  1 ,  2 , or  3 ). All complexes are capable of generating 1O2 in 95% ethanol with &#981;1&#927;2 efficiencies which range from 2% to 29%. These complexes are toxic to HeLa cells when irradiated with UV light (&#955;exc = 365 nm) for 2 minutes. IC50 values for the LnIII complexes are in the range 15.2 &#8211; 16.2 &#956;M; the most potent compound is [Nd 2Thept(COO)4]&#8208;. The cell death mechanisms are further explored using an Annexin V &#8211; propidium iodide assay which suggests that cell death occurs through both apoptosis and necrosis.</dc:description>

      <title>Thermal Decomposition of Ternary Sodium Graphite Intercalation Compounds</title>
      <dc:description>
Graphite Intercalation compounds (GICs) are often used to produce exfoliated or functionalized graphene related materials in a specific solvent. The bulk of the intercalation compound is stable under ambient conditions, trapped between the graphene layers. However, heating drives a reorganization of the sodium and associated solvent molecules, leading to the step&#8208;wise evaporation of the solvent. More information can be found in the Full Paper by M.&#8197;S.&#8197;P. Shaffer et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202000422).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Graphite Intercalation compounds (GICs)&lt;/b&gt; are often used to produce exfoliated or functionalized graphene related materials in a specific solvent. The bulk of the intercalation compound is stable under ambient conditions, trapped between the graphene layers. However, heating drives a reorganization of the sodium and associated solvent molecules, leading to the step&#8208;wise evaporation of the solvent. More information can be found in the Full Paper by M.&#8197;S.&#8197;P. Shaffer et&#8197;al. (DOI: &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.20200042210.1002/chem.202000422&lt;/a&gt;).

      <title>Fundamental Insights into the Covalent Silane Functionalization of NiFe Layered Double Hydroxides</title>
      <dc:description>
Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have attracted enormous attention due to their outstanding energy applications. Although these materials have been intensively investigated, some fundamental aspects of their chemistry remain elusive for the scientific community. This work explores the covalent functionalization with (3&#8208;aminopropyl)trietoxysilanes of a NiFe&#8208;LDH, widely known for its excellent electrochemical properties. The influence of the covalent grafting on its structure, morphology, magnetism, adsorptive properties, and electrochemical behavior is fully addressed, paving the way to the synthesis of new hybrid materials and architectures.

      <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional porous carbon nanosheets (2DPCs) with controlled hexagonal morphology are reported, using LDH and ionic polyimide as template and carbon precursor, respectively. Looking at the top right&#8208;hand corner, we can see the polyimide model, which represents the viologen&#8208;linked ionic polyimide with both sp2&#8208; and sp3&#8208;hybridized nitrogen atoms. Such an ionic polyimide acts as the carbon precursor for 2DPCs. Looking at the bottom left corner, we can see an oxygen molecule, with electrons on a sharp arrow pointing the way to a lighting bulb, suggesting the typical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with four&#8208;electron mechanism and production of electricity for typical Zn&#8208;air batteries. This cover highlights that 2DPCs with large lateral sizes can provide long&#8208;distance conductivity and connected heteroatom active sites to boost the performance for energy conversion and storage.

      <title>Bromine&#8208;Functionalized Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
      <dc:description>
The Bro code: A 2D electron withdrawing bromine functionalized covalent organic frameworks (COFs) was constructed and served as the first example for fabricating a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) device.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) enable precise integration of various organic building blocks into porous skeletons through topology predesign. Here, we report the first example of COFs by integrating electron withdrawing bromine group onto the skeletons for triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG). The resulting framework exhibits high surface area and good crystallinity. Thus, the bromine functionalized COF has more regular aligned &#960; columns and arrays over the skeleton than bare COFs, which in turn significantly enhances charge transport ability. As a result, bromine functionalized COFs showed higher electrical output performance at 5&#8197;Hz with a peak value of short circuit current density of 43.6&#8197;&#956;A and output voltage of 416&#8197;V, which is 2 and 1.3&#8197;times higher than those of bare COFs (21.6&#8197;&#956;A and 318&#8197;V), respectively. These results demonstrated that this strategy for engineering electron withdrawing groups on the skeleton could open a new aspect of COFs for developing TENG devices.

The key challenge in electrochemical water splitting process is to develop low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on cathode and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on anode. OER is the most important half&#8208;reaction involved in water splitting, which has been extensively studied since the last century and a large amount of electrocatalysts including noble and non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based materials have been developed. Among them, transition metal borides and borates (TMBs) based compounds with various structures have attracted increasing attention due to their excellent OER performance. In recent years, many efforts have been devoted to explore the OER mechanism of TMBs and to improve the OER activity and stability of TMBs. Here in this review, we summarized the recent research progress made in TMBs as efficient electrocatalysts for OER. The chemical properties, synthetic methodologies, catalytic performance evaluation and improvement strategy of TMBs as OER electrocatalysts are discussed.

      <title>Reactivity of Binary and Ternary Sulfur Halides towards Transition&#8208;Metal Compounds</title>
      <dc:description>
So much sulfur: The reactivity of the binary and ternary sulfur halides S2Cl2, SCl2, SF4, SF6, and SF5Cl towards transition&#8208;metal compounds is described. Reaction pathways include sulfurization, chlorination, chlorofluorination, or fluorination at metal centers, but also the generation of ligands containing sulfur halide moieties.







Abstract
Binary sulfur fluorides exhibit an interesting reactivity towards transition metal complexes. They open up routes for the generation of sulfur&#8208;containing building blocks. Often ligands with particular properties can be constructed. This includes their ability to transfer sulfur atoms or polysulfide units as well as fluorination reactions. This Minireview provides an insight into the reactivity of the binary and ternary sulfur halides S2Cl2, SCl2, SF4, SF6 and SF5Cl towards transition&#8208;metal compounds.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;So much sulfur&lt;/b&gt;: The reactivity of the binary and ternary sulfur halides S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, SCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, and SF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl towards transition&#8208;metal compounds is described. Reaction pathways include sulfurization, chlorination, chlorofluorination, or fluorination at metal centers, but also the generation of ligands containing sulfur halide moieties.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Binary sulfur fluorides exhibit an interesting reactivity towards transition metal complexes. They open up routes for the generation of sulfur&#8208;containing building blocks. Often ligands with particular properties can be constructed. This includes their ability to transfer sulfur atoms or polysulfide units as well as fluorination reactions. This Minireview provides an insight into the reactivity of the binary and ternary sulfur halides S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, SCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and SF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl towards transition&#8208;metal compounds.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tricoordinate Coinage Metal Complexes with a Redox&#8208;Active Tris&#8208;(Ferrocenyl)triazine Backbone Feature Triazine&#8211;Metal Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>
One to hold them all: A redox&#8208;active tris(ferrocenyl)triazine&#8208;based tris&#8208;phosphane was shown to bind all coinage metal(I) ions in the same trigonal&#8208;planar mode, stabilised by rare triazine&#8211;metal interactions. The intriguing solution&#8208;state chemistry of these complexes was investigated by using variable&#8208;temperature NMR spectroscopy and spectroelectrochemistry.







Abstract
2,4,6&#8208;Tris(1&#8208;diphenylphosphanyl&#8208;1&#8217;&#8208;ferrocenylene)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (1) coordinates all three coinage metal(I) ions in a 1:1 tridentate coordination mode. The C3&#8208;symmetric coordination in both solid state and solution is stabilised by an uncommon cation&#8211;&#960; interaction between the triazine core and the metal cation. Intramolecular dynamic behaviour was observed by variable&#8208;temperature NMR spectroscopy. The borane adduct of 1, 1BH3, displays four accessible oxidation states, suggesting complexes of 1 to be intriguing candidates for redox&#8208;switchable catalysis. Complexes&#8197;1Cu, 1Ag, and 1Au display a more complicated electrochemical behaviour, and the electrochemical mechanism was studied by temperature&#8208;resolved UV/Vis spectroelectrochemistry and chemical oxidation.

      <title>Octaboraneyl Complexes of Nickel: Monomers for Redox&#8208;Active Coordination Polymers</title>

Inspired by its biosynthetic hypothesis, we synthesized this PTA collection by reductive activation of stable phloroglucinol precursors into highly reactive  ortho  &#8208;quinone methide (o&#8208;QM) intermediates and subsequently Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition. We also demonstrated for the first time the generation process of the active  o&#8208;QM by performing dynamic nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and HPLC&#8208;MS monitoring experiments. Moreover, the PTA collection showed significant antifeedant effect toward the  Plutella xylostella  larvae.</dc:description>

      <title>A Resin&#8208;Supported Formate Catalyst for the Transformative Reduction of Carbon Dioxide with Hydrosilanes</title>
      <dc:description>A heterogeneous formate anion catalyst for the transformative reduction of carbon dioxide (CO  2  ) based on a polystyrene and divinylbenzene copolymer modified with alkylammonium formate was prepared from a widely available anion exchange resin. The catalyst preparation was easy and the characterization was carried out using elemental analysis, Fourier transform infrared (FT&#8208;IR) spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and solid&#8208;state  13  C cross&#8208;polarization/magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (  13  C CP/MAS NMR) spectroscopy. The catalyst displayed good catalytic activity for the direct reduction of CO  2  with hydrosilanes, tunably yielding silylformate or methoxysilane products depending on the hydrosilanes used. The catalyst was also active for the reductive insertion of CO  2  into both primary and secondary amines. The catalytic activity of the resin&#8208;supported formate can be predicted from the FT&#8208;IR spectra of the catalyst, probably because of the difference in the ionic interaction strength between the supported alkylammonium cations and formate anions. The ion pair density is thought to influence the catalytic activity, as shown by the elemental and solid&#8208;state  13  C NMR analyses.</dc:description>

      <title>Selectivity over kinetic and thermodynamically driven pathways of crystallization to yield Co&#8208;facial and Slipped Stack dimers in single crystals</title>
      <dc:description>Control over the molecular packing in the solid state is of utmost importance in regulating the bulk optical properties of organic semiconductors. The electronic coupling between the molecules makes it possible to improve the properties of the bulk materials. Herein, we report an example on the control over selectivity  of the formation of  polymorphic single crystals of  25TR  by (i) kinetic or (ii) thermodynamic course of crystallisation to yield slipped stack (  S  ) and co&#8208;facial (  C  ) dimeric type in their single crystals.&#160;&#160;Both the forms show significant excitonic interactions in solid state and eventually the  S&#8208;  dimeric form has strong yellowish orange fluorescence while the  C  &#8208;dimeric form is non fluorescent in their crystalline state. Density functional theory calculations and the differential scanning calorimetric experiments revealed that the  C  &#8208;dimer polymorph is the thermodynamically stable form with a free energy offset of 0.43 eV in comparison to the  S  &#8208;dimer. Interestingly, the thermodynamically driven non&#8208;fluorescent single crystal is found to be convertible to its fluorescent form irreversibly by thermal trigger. The charge carrier&#8208;transport characteristics of these two polymorphs are computed using the Marcus&#8211;Hush formalism. The computational results on the charge carrier transport behaviour revealed that the  S  &#8208;dimer (  25TR  (R)  ) is ambipolar while the  C  &#8208;dimer (  25TR  (Y)  ) is majorly n&#8208;type.</dc:description>

      <title>The Xanthate Route to Indolines, Indoles, and their Aza Congeners</title>
      <dc:description>Convergent routes to a variety of indolines, indoles, oxindoles, and their aza analogues involving radical additions of xanthates are described. Three approaches are summarized. The first is the least general and relies on the generation of aryl or heteroaryl radicals starting from diazonium salts. The second involves radical addition to  N  &#8208;allylanilines followed by ring&#8208;closure onto the aromatic core. A large variety of indolines and azaindolines can thus be obtained and, in many cases, converted into the corresponding indoles and azaindoles by various methods. The synthesis of novel fluoroazaindolines and fluoroazaindoles by a rare homolytic  ipso  &#8208;substitution of fluorine atoms is particularly noteworthy. The last approach hinges on the direct modification of indoles by radical addition to the pyrrole subunit of the indole nucleus. Application of this methodology to the total synthesis of melatonin and the alkaloids mersicarpine, caulerpine, and the pentacyclic skeleton of tronocarpine is briefly discussed. Most of the compounds described herein would be difficult to obtain by more traditional routes.</dc:description>

      <title>Structural Transformation of SnS2 to SnS by Mo Doping Produces Electro/Photocatalyst for Hydrogen Production</title>
      <dc:description>SnS and SnS  2  are layered semiconductors, with potential promising properties for electro&#8208;catalytic and photocatalytic hydrogen (H  2  ) production. The vast knowledge in preparation and modification of layered structures was still not employed successfully in this system to fully maximize its potential. Here, we provide the first report of structural transformation of SnS  2  into SnS with Mo&#8208;doping as a bifunctional catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The structural phase transition optimized the properties of the material, providing a more delicate morphology with additional catalytic sites. The electrochemical studies showed overpotential of 377 mV at 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  for HER with Tafel slopes of 100 mV dec  &#8208;1  in 0.5 M H  2  SO  4  for 10% Mo&#8208;SnS. The same structure acts as an efficient photocatalyst in the generation of H  2  from water under visible illumination with rate of 0.136 mmole/g&#8729;h of H  2  , which is 20 times higher than pristine SnS  2  under visible light.</dc:description>

      <title>Noncovalent Functionalization of Few&#8208;Layered Antimonene with Fullerene Clusters and Photoinduced Charge Separation in the Composite</title>
      <dc:description>Few&#8208;layered a ntimonene (FLSb) nanosheets were noncovalently functionalized with fullerene C  60  clusters by quick addition of a poor solvent (i.e., acetonitrile) into a mixed dispersion of FLSb and C  60  in a good solvent (i.e., toluene). In a flash&#8208;photolysis time&#8208;resolved microwave conductivity (FP&#8208;TRMC) measurement, the FLSb&#8211;C  60  composite, (FLSb+C  60  )  m  , showed a rapid rise in transient conductivity, whereas no conductivity signal was observed in the single components, FLSb and C  60  . This demonstrated the occurrence of photoinduced charge separation between FLSb and C  60  in (FLSb+C  60  )  m  . Furthermore, a photoelectrochemical device with an electrophoretically deposited (FLSb+C  60  )  m  film exhibited an enhanced efficiency of photocurrent generation, compared to th ose of the single&#8208;components, FLSb and C  60  , due to the photoinduced charge separation between FLSb and C  60  . This work provides a promising approach for fabrication of antimonene&#8211;organic molecule composites and paves the way for their application in optoelectronics.</dc:description>
