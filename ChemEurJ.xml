         <title>Activation of S1PR1 by Ponesimod for Multiple Sclerosis Therapy: Uncovering MAPK and PI3K Pathway Mechanisms and Repurposing Potential</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ponesimod, a selective S1PR1 modulator approved for MS, might activate the S1PR1 by triggering key signaling pathways like MAPK/ERK and PI3K&#8208;Akt to inhibit lymphocyte migration. This work provides new insights into the mechanism of ponesimod in MS treatment and highlights the potential of drug repurposing to advance MS therapy.








Abstract
Multiple sclerosis (MS), affecting over 2 million people globally, primarily causes neurological disability in individuals under 40. This autoimmune disorder involves the immune system attacking the myelin sheath in the central nervous system. Sphingosine&#8208;1&#8208;phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) is a promising therapeutic target, with approved drugs like ponesimod acting as S1PR1 agonists. However, the exact mechanism of ponesimod's action on S1PR1 and its therapeutic effects in MS remains unclear. Our study, combining metadynamics, single&#8208;cell transcriptomics, and drug repurposing, shows that ponesimod binds to S1PR1, causing the W2696.48 amino acid to flip downward. This flip weakens interactions within the phosphorylation&#8208;independent binding (PIF) motif while maintaining the N3077.49&#8208;F2656.44 interaction, activating Gi signaling. The downstream effects primarily involve the MAPK/ERK and PI3K&#8208;Akt pathways, which inhibit lymphocyte migration to lymph nodes, a crucial factor in ponesimod's clinical efficacy. Single&#8208;cell transcriptomic analysis further elucidates the regulatory network and pathways modulated by ponesimod in MS. Notably, due to potential hepatotoxicity, we identified valproic acid (VPA) as a potential adjunct therapy through drug repurposing. VPA reduces hepatotoxicity and demonstrates efficacy in treating MS in animal studies. This research provides valuable insights into ponesimod's mechanism in MS treatment and highlights the potential of drug repurposing to improve MS therapy.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Mediated Divergent Synthesis of Sulfonylated Dihydropyrrole&#8208;3&#8208;Carboxaldehydes and Tricyclic Sulfones via Sulfonyl Radical Source Modulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insert text for Table of Contents here. This study introduces an environmentally friendly and efficient photocatalytic approach, wherein the sulfonyl radical&#8208;induced cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes facilitates the selective synthesis of sulfonylated dihydropyrrole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxaldehydes and tricyclic benzo&#8208;fused seven&#8208;membered sulfones. The strategy's tunability arises from the sulfonyl radical source, which directs the reaction toward either radical cyclization or cascade cyclization.








Abstract
In this study, we present a green and efficient photocatalytic strategy, where sulfonyl radical&#8208;triggered cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes enables the selective formation of the sulfonylated dihydropyrrole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxaldehydes and tricyclic benzofused seven&#8208;membered sulfones. The switchable nature of the strategy relies on the selective control between radical cyclization and radical cascade cyclization, dictated by the choice of sulfonyl radical source. Under the photocatalytic conditions, selenosulfonates yielded sulfonylated heterocyclic carboxaldehydes, while sodium aryl sulfinates led to the formation of tricyclic benzo&#8208;fused seven&#8208;membered sulfones. Under blue LED irradiation, selenosulfonates generate sulfonyl and phenylselenyl radicals. The sulfonyl radical adds chemoselectively to the alkene, triggering a 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization to form a vinyl radical, which is trapped by the phenylselenyl radical. Oxygen and EY&#8208;Na&#8322; facilitate the conversion of selenosulfonylated intermediates into sulfonylated 4,5&#8208;dihydropyrrole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxaldehydes. A range of 4,5&#8208;dihydropyrrole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxaldehydes was synthesized using the developed method. Sodium aryl sulfinates, under blue LED irradiation and in the presence of 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;Hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol&#160;(HFIP)1,1&#8208;Diphenylethylene, react with 1,6&#8208;enynes to afford tricyclic benzo&#8208;fused seven&#8208;membered sulfones. Additionally, the tricyclic sulfone can be readily transformed into a unique bicyclic seven&#8208;membered sulfone bearing an exocyclic double bond. A variety of control experiments was performed, providing important mechanistic understanding of both steps in the transformation.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis and Structural Determination of the Inositol Glycan Head of Plant Sphingolipid GIPC in Brassicaceae</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first experimental identification of the IG head structure of naturally occurring plant GIPCs in Brassicaceae was achieved through the chemical synthesis of three hexose&#8208;type IGs containing d&#8208;glucose, d&#8208;galactose, or d&#8208;mannose as the second monosaccharide linked to d&#8208;glucuronic acid&#8208;&#945;(1&#8594;2)&#8208;myo&#8208;inositol. Comparison with synthetic standards using analytical techniques revealed that natural IG from cabbage contains d&#8208;mannose with an &#945;&#8208;glycosidic linkage as the second monosaccharide.








Abstract
Glycosylinositol phosphoceramides (GIPCs), a major class of plant sphingolipids, are key components of the plasma membrane and play important roles in plants. These molecules consist of a ceramide 1&#8208;phosphate tail attached to an inositol glycan (IG) head, which typically contains an d&#8208;glucuronic acid (GlcA)&#8208;&#945;(1&#8594;2)&#8208;myo&#8208;inositol structure. The second monosaccharide linked to the O&#8208;4 position of the GlcA residue differs depending on plant species and cell tissues. In Arabidopsis, the predominant second monosaccharide has been identified as hexose (Hex) using LC&#8208;MS/MS analysis. However, the stereochemistry and anomeric configuration of the Hex have not yet been determined using spectroscopic techniques. In this study, we chemically synthesized three different Hex&#8208;type IGs in which the GlcA residue binds to d&#8208;glucose, d&#8208;galactose, or d&#8208;mannose (Man) as the second monosaccharide. Using the synthetic standards, we determined the IG head structure of naturally occurring GIPCs&#160;isolated from cabbage by using several analytical methods. We successfully confirmed that Hex as the second monosaccharide linked to the GlcA residue is d&#8208;Man with an &#945;&#8208;glycosidic bond.

         <title>Engineering Alloxazines by Boron Coordination and Click Chemistry toward Small&#8208;molecule Fluorescent Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design of fluorescent molecules inspired by natural cofactors to monitor biological processes carries some intrinsic advantages. This is particularly relevant in the case of redox cofactors with innate fluorescence properties, such as flavins, and synthetic strategies toward their functionalized analogues are of high interest to modulate properties. This work reports easy access to bioinspired fluorescent alloxazines (flavin analogues) with a boron difluorocatecholate moiety and further chemical elaboration through a CuAAC (copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition) click chemistry strategy, which opens the way to easy derivatization and further addressing. This molecular approach provides a design concept that could lead to bimodal probes detectable by fluorescence and 19F NMR spectroscopy.








Abstract
Selective and strategic modification of redox cofactors offers significant advantages for the design of molecular probes, including high compatibility and affinity. This is particularly relevant in the case of redox cofactors with innate fluorescence properties, such as flavins, and synthetic strategies toward their functionalized analogues are of high interest to modulate properties. However, the synthetic elaboration of flavins and their alloxazine isomers still suffers from limitations. We report easy access to bioinspired fluorescent alloxazines with a boron difluorocatecholate moiety and explore the impact of core aromatic substitution on their photophysical properties. Further chemical elaboration through a CuAAC (copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition) click chemistry strategy opens the way to easy derivatization and further addressing.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Single&#8208;Crystalline Covalent Organic Frameworks: The Use of Modulator for Reversible Bond Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as versatile materials owing to their ordered crystalline structures, tunable topologies, and high surface areas. Accurate structural determination is essential for understanding the correlation between their structural features and physical properties. This review emphasizes recent progress in growing single&#8208;crystalline COFs via modulator&#8208;assisted strategies, enabling SCXRD analysis and expanding their functional applications.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), notable for their well&#8208;organized crystalline structures, varied framework topologies, and large surface areas, have been actively studied for diverse applications. Their distinct properties are related primarily to their crystalline frameworks; therefore, obtaining accurate structural information is important. Notable advances in the structural analysis of COFs using powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and Pawley or Rietveld refinement have been made; however, these methods sometimes encounter limitations. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) has been suggested as an alternative technique for obtaining accurate structural information on COFs. However, harvesting COFs of sufficiently high purity and quality, with crystals of sufficient size for SCXRD analysis, is difficult. Significant research on growing single&#8208;crystalline COFs (SC&#8208;COFs) with large crystals using modulators for reversible bond control has recently enabled SCXRD studies. In this review, we introduce various strategies, including molecular design and synthesis methods, for growing SC&#8208;COFs, and highlight several notable examples that leverage precise structural information for specific applications.

         <title>Mechanical Strain&#8208;Controlled Aromaticity in Cyclo[n]Carbons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanical strain can influence the (anti)aromaticity of C16 and C18 cyclocarbons. While uniaxial tension has a minor weakening effect, radial expansion leads to an almost complete loss of aromaticity in both systems. Radial contraction, especially in C18, significantly enhances aromaticity, offering a strategy for designing more stable cyclocarbons in mechanically interlocked architectures.








Abstract
Cyclocarbons have unique electronic and mechanical properties, but their extreme reactivity makes experimental studies and practical applications highly challenging. In this work, we use molecular modeling to investigate how mechanical strain, including uniaxial tension and radial contraction/expansion, affects the aromaticity of C16 and C18 cyclocarbons. Aromaticity was evaluated using magnetic (NICS, GIMIC) and electronic (&#960;&#8208;EDDB, AV1245) indices to provide a comprehensive assessment. Our results show that uniaxial tension slightly reduces the (anti)aromaticity of both cyclocarbons, with C16 becoming less antiaromatic and C18 less aromatic. Radial expansion leads to almost complete loss of aromaticity, regardless of the initial electronic nature of the cyclocarbon. In turn, radial contraction appears to be an effective approach to enhance electronic delocalization in cyclocarbons, with a particularly notable effect for C18. One of the most significant findings is that an 8% radial contraction transforms moderately aromatic C18 into a highly aromatic system with fully equalized bond lengths, offering a potential strategy for designing more stable cyclocarbon systems within mechanically strained architectures.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Thermo&#8208;Mechanochemical Syntheses of Metal Phthalocyanines and Polyphthalocyanines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we report the thermo&#8208;mechanochemical synthesis of metal phthalocyanines using a ball mill with heating jackets, achieving quantitative yields at 120&#160;&#176;C within 2 h. The parameter screenings revealed an insight into the reactivity of the reaction. Furthermore, various metal centers and building blocks were utilized to emphasize the variability of this approach. Lastly, a crystalline cobalt polyphthalocyanine was synthesized with&#160;&gt;99% yield.








Abstract
We present a thermo&#8208;mechanochemical synthesis of metal phthalocyanines with varying metal centers and building blocks. The reactions were performed using a Retsch Mixer Mill 400 equipped with heating jackets, achieving quantitative yields at 120&#160;&#176;C within 2 h. A systematic screening of reaction parameters, including temperature, reaction time, frequency, and liquid&#8208;assisted grinding (LAG), revealed that temperature and time significantly influence the reaction outcome, as well as the use of LAG compared to neat grinding, which further enhances the yield. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of the obtained metal phthalocyanines confirmed the presence of different polymorphs, suggesting a correlation between reaction conditions and crystallinity. Furthermore, the crystalline cobalt polyphthalocyanine (CoPPc) was successfully synthesized with a yield of&#160;&gt;99%.

Interaction of a membrane protein of Acinetobacter baumanii with human fibronectin unraveled using &#181;s&#8208;scale molecular dynamic simulations.








Abstract
Bacterial resistance and nosocomial infections are serious threats compromising public health in numerous countries. Acinetobacter baumannii has been identified as one of the most serious pathogens, due to its potential virulence and the development of multiple resistance. In this contribution by using all&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulation, we analyze the structure and the properties of the OmpA protein, which is present in the bacterial external membrane. We also analyze the structure of possible protein/protein complexes formed between OmpA and the human fibronectin, which may ultimately lead to the immune escape of the bacteria. We provide a plausible structure of the complex, also identifying suitable amino acids mediating the interaction, and thus, constituting suitable drug targets to disrupt the complex formation.

Abstract
Two Ru(II) and Os(II) homoleptic complexes based on a phenanthroline&#8208;pyridylidene tridentate ligand have been designed to reach NIR emission by combining strong &#963;&#8208;donation, provided by the unconventional N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) pyridylidene moiety, with the low&#8208;lying &#960;&#8208;accepting phenanthroline scaffold. Detailed experimental and computational investigations of the photophysical properties of this novel family of cyclometallated complexes reveal emission squarely falling in the NIR domain peaking at &#955;em = 790&#160;nm for the Os(II) complex, while emission is hypsochromically shifted at &#955;em = 747&#160;nm for the Ru(II) homologue in deaerated CH3CN solution at room temperature. Despite the triplet metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MLCT) nature that characterizes the excited state in both complexes, density functional theory (DFT) calculations allow to ascribe the remarkable optical shift observed in the latter to the larger spin&#8208;orbital coupling (SOC) effects exerted by the heavier metal.

Abstract
Rare&#8208;earth La&#8208;modulated NiFeP composites were prepared via a facile co&#8208;precipitation route followed by in situ phosphatization of La&#8208;doped NiFe&#8208;LDH precursors.

         <title>Ferrocene&#8208;Mediated Photochemical Reduction of Naphthol to Generate Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excited&#8208;state quenching of 7&#8208;bromonaphthol by ferrocene leads to a reduced naphthol and H2 generation. This simple, and sustainable, system is operational at mild applied potentials under photoelectrochemical conditions.








Abstract
The storage of solar energy in chemical bonds can be achieved utilizing more sustainable first row transition metals and organic compounds. Here we show that the weak acid, 7&#8208;bromonaphthol, can generate H2 upon photoexcitation and subsequent electron transfer mediated by ferrocene under photochemical and photoelectrochemical conditions. Evidence is presented to show that near visible, UV&#8208;light absorption by 7&#8208;bromonapthol generates an excited&#8208;state molecule that is reductively quenched by ferrocene. UV&#8208;visible spectroscopy shows the buildup of ferrocenium, and gas chromatography shows the generation of H2 when an acetonitrile solution of 7&#8208;bromonaphthol and ferrocene are irradiated with 365&#160;nm light. This reactivity can be translated to photoelectrochemical conditions. In the presence of 7&#8208;bromonaphthol in acetonitrile, carbon electrodes modified with ferrocene exhibit higher current responses compared to unmodified carbon electrodes at an applied potential of just &#8722;0.3&#160;V versus the saturated calomel electrode (SCE). These results highlight the ability of ferrocene to mediate electron transfer to the naphthol molecule and the possibility to translate this reactivity into photoelectrochemical devices.

         <title>Mass Spectrometric Studies of Reductive Elimination from Si(IV) Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reductive elimination of ArO&#9472;H (Ar = aromatic residue) bonds from pentacoordinate SiIV is characterized by mass spectrometric methods. A Hammet study of substituent effects combined with DFT calculations supports a stepwise mechanism involving a loosely bound aryloxide/hydrosilane ion&#8208;molecule complex as an intermediate.








Abstract
Reductive elimination (RE) is one of the most significant obstacles to developing main&#8208;group catalysts for bond coupling processes based on conventional oxidative addition/reductive elimination steps. Here, we report an electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) study demonstrating RE from SiIV hydrosilicates [(tmim)SiH(OArR)]&#8722; (tmimH3 = tris(3&#8208;methylindol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methane) generated in solution by oxidative addition of phenols (ArRO&#9472;H) to an anionic SiII centre (silanide) incorporated in a bicyclic cage structure ([(tmim)Si]&#8722;). The activation energy for the reductive elimination linearly decreased with the increasing electron&#8208;withdrawing character of the aryl substituents, suggesting that a negative charge develops in the para position in the rate&#8208;limiting step (RLS). In agreement with experiments, a DFT study supports an ionic mechanism in which the formation of an ion/molecule complex by transient weakening of the Si&#9472;O bond is the RLS, as would be intuitively expected from the developing negative charge in the para position. This is a rare example of direct observation of reductive elimination from SiIV to SiII and, to our knowledge, the first involving anionic species.

         <title>Optimization of Prodrug Activation by Enzymatic Cleavage of the &#946;&#8208;lactam Ring of Carbapenems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report synthetic routes that yield prodrugs consisting of two carbapenems connected by benzyl carbonate linkers. A mass spectrometry assay was elaborated to monitor, in a single kinetic experiment, the acylation of a bacterial target (a peptidoglycan transpeptidase) by these prodrugs, the resulting cleavage of the linker, and the release of their warhead moiety in an active form.








Abstract
&#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotics remain the best treatment to fight bacterial infections. Among various antibiotics used today, &#946;&#8208;lactams belonging to the carbapenem class are last resort drugs active against many multiresistant Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. Carbapenem antibiotics are prone to hydrolysis by certain &#946;&#8208;lactamases, leading to the opening of the &#946;&#8208;lactam ring and drug inactivation. This mechanism can be repurposed for targeted molecular fragmentation. Here, we report the synthesis of model prodrugs consisting of two carbapenems connected by original self&#8208;immolative linkers. A mass spectrometry assay was developed to simultaneously monitor acylation of a &#946;&#8208;lactam target by the prodrugs and by their sacrificial and warhead moieties. The linker connecting the two carbapenems was optimized with respect to prodrug stability and effective release of the activated warhead upon carbapenem ring opening.

Studying such interactions on a structural level is a challenge. Parlato and colleagues report on their use of solid&#8208;state NMR and electron microscopy to probe how such antibodies bind to the fuzzy coat of HTT fibrils, modulating their structure and supramolecular assembly.








Abstract
Antibodies are critical for the immune response and serve as important tools due to their ability to recognize specific amino acid sequences, or epitopes. Based on the latter, they are utilized as diagnostic tools in biological and biomedical research. Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative condition caused by CAG repeat expansions in the huntingtin (HTT) gene and characterized by amyloid&#8208;like protein deposits in patients. Multiple anti&#8208;HTT antibodies are used in HD research for their ability to recognize specific HTT inclusions in both post&#8208;mortem tissue and in laboratory conditions. Some of the antibodies are seen as detectors of distinct structural motifs. However, most knowledge of their binding mechanism stems from studies of soluble monomers or short fragments of the epitopes, rather than the aggregated, misfolded target protein. Here, we investigate how MW8 antibodies interact with HTT exon 1 (HTTex1) fibrils, using solid&#8208;state NMR, electron microscopy, and complementary techniques. Magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR revealed localized impacts of the antibody on exposed parts of the HTTex1 fibrils: the flanking segments that form its &#8220;fuzzy coat&#8221;. Antibody binding affected the structure and dynamics of the fuzzy coat, but also modulated the propensity for forming supramolecular fibril clusters, which has important implications for (reducing) cytotoxicity.

         <title>Rational Design and Mechanistic Insights Into Transition Metal&#8208;Based Spin&#8208;Modulated Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although numerous theories have been widely applied to explain the enhanced OER activity, the mechanism involving spin configurations that tune the OER process remains unclear. This short review highlights some recent advances in understanding spin&#8208;modulated oxygen evolution of transition metal&#8208;based catalysts and provides insights into the fundamentals of the spin effect and design strategies for spin&#8208;modulated OER catalysts.








Abstract
Harnessing secondary energy sources for water electrolysis to generate &#8220;green hydrogen&#8221; is instrumental in constructing a zero&#8208;carbon&#8208;emission hydrogen value chain. However, the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) presents a bottleneck due to its complex four&#8208;step proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process. Investigation of high&#8208;performance anodic OER catalysts has developed into a hot research field. The high kinetic barrier associated with OER is strongly linked to the interplay between the singlet state of OH&#8722;/H2O and the triplet state of O2, this interconversion process is significantly influenced by the spin states of metal centers in catalysts. In this short review, the fundamental mechanisms of spin effects in oxygen evolution are briefly discussed with respect to the thermodynamics, active species formation, and reaction mechanisms. In addition, the recent approaches to modulate spin configuration of electrocatalysts are summarized, such as lattice substitution, defect engineering, interface regulation, ligand adsorption, and size modulation. In the last section, the challenges and perspectives for future development of spin&#8208;related catalysis are discussed, aiming to provide insights into spin effects in water oxidation and guidance for designing efficient OER catalysts.

         <title>Nanobodies in Immunoanalysis: From Molecular Engineering to Advanced Detection Strategies for Foodborne Natural Toxins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a bottom&#8208;to&#8208;top overview of emerging nanobody&#8208;based immunoassays, from fundamental nanobodies to advanced applications in natural toxin detection.








Abstract
Natural toxins in food pose significant health risks, such as cancer, deformities, etc., demanding efficient and accurate surveillance techniques. Immunoassays become reliable alternatives to traditional chromatographic technologies for rapid, routine, and large&#8208;scale detection of natural toxins, but their performance depends highly on antibodies used, which are limited by stability issues and productions challenge. Nanobodies (Nbs) overcome these limitations, enhancing immunoassay sensitivity, specificity, and practicality for low&#8208;abundance toxin detection due to their good penetration/binding ability, inherent stability, and scalable production. This review offers a comprehensive, bottom&#8208;to&#8208;top overview of emerging Nb&#8208;based immunoassays, from foundational Nbs to advanced applications in natural toxin detection. The bioactivity of Nbs was summarized, focusing on their structural and functional characteristics critical for advancing immunoassays. Subsequently, the advanced methods for their screening, expression, and purification were outlined. Based on the natural toxins they target, both conventional and innovative Nb&#8208;based immunoassays are reviewed, in which corresponding Nbs modification strategies are highlighted for improving the affinity and sensitivity. The current challenges, potential strategies, and future opportunities for developing and applying Nb&#8208;based immunoassays are also discussed in natural toxin detection. This review, bridging fundamental Nb advances and immunoassay innovation, offers valuable perspectives to guide future development of Nb&#8208;based detection platforms.

         <title>Clickable Pyclen&#8208;Based Luminescent Lanthanide Complexes: Application to Two&#8208;Photon Microscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents two pyclen&#8208;based lanthanide complexes (Eu3+ and Sm3+) bearing an alkynyl&#8208;linker dedicated to bioconjugation. Featuring strong luminescence and two&#8208;photon (2P) absorption, they were conjugated to a cell&#8208;penetrating peptide thanks to copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition. The resulting luminescent conjugates reach efficiently the cytosol of living HeLa cells and allow two&#8208;photon microscopy imaging at low concentrations, down to 50&#160;nM&#160;in the case of Eu3+.








Abstract
Lanthanide luminescent bioprobes incorporating a reactive group for the functionalization of biomolecules via click chemistry are of high interest for the straightforward preparation of smart luminescent tools for biological imaging and sensing applications. This article describes the synthesis and the photophysical properties of two lanthanide complexes based on the pyclen macrocycle bearing a terminal alkyne group on its pyridine moiety and a 4&#8208;(4&#8208;alkylthiophenyl)picolinate charge transfer chromophore to sensitize the lanthanide luminescence. The Eu3+ and Sm3+ complexes show excellent two&#8208;photon absorption and emission properties. These complexes were conjugated to a cell penetrating peptide bearing an azide via copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition. The resulting conjugates exhibit luminescence properties comparable to those of the parent alkyne&#8208;complex. Two&#8208;photon microscopy imaging of live HeLa cells was performed with both the Eu3+ and the Sm3+ conjugates. These bioprobes are efficiently delivered to the cytosol of the living cells. The Eu3+ luminescence was detected in cells even at very low incubation concentration (50&#160;nM) and the Sm3+ complex gave excellent quality images despite a low emission quantum yield (&lt; 1&#160;%).

         <title>A Water Stable U(IV) Complex Based on a Macrocyclic Ligand Displaying NIR Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;stable U(IV) complex is obtained by coordination of U(IV) with a nonadentate macrocyclic ligand based on a triazacyclononane platform. The U(IV) cation is fully protected from coordination of water molecules, and upon excitation into the UV&#8208;Visible region, the complex displays an unprecedented NIR emission from U(IV).








Abstract
Complexation of U(IV) by encapsulation into the cavity of a 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclonane (tacn) macrocycle functionalized by phosphonated pyridyl arms affords a water&#8208;stable and soluble [U(IV)L] complex. The coordination process was monitored by electronic UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR absorption spectroscopy and the corresponding complex was characterized by 1H&#8208;, 13C&#8208; and 31P&#8208;NMR spectroscopy and by mass spectrometry. Density functional theory (DFT) modeling shows the cation to be embedded into the cavity of the nonadentate ligand, as confirmed by analysis of the paramagnetic contributions of U(IV) on the chemical shifts of the proton nuclei. This effective chelation enabled the observation of a broad NIR emission band centered at 1080&#160;nm observed for the first time in addition to UV&#8208;visible emission arising from the U(IV) cation upon electronic excitation in the UV&#8208;blue region. The [U(IV)L] complex was shown to be hydrolytically stable for several weeks in aqueous solutions over a broad range of pH values (from 1.6 to 10) under aerobic conditions.

         <title>Effective RNA Complexation by [2]Catenanes Confers Enhanced Resistance to Enzymatic Degradation</title>

Peptide&#8208;based cationic [2]catenanes are resistant to proteases and efficiently complex siRNA, providing protection from degradation by nucleases.








Abstract
Cationic [2]catenanes bearing l&#8208;arginine residues were synthesized via dynamic covalent self&#8208;assembly in water. These peptide&#8208;based mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) exhibit proteolytic stability, efficiently complex small&#8208;interfering RNA (siRNA), and protect it from nuclease degradation. Their performance in siRNA binding is attributed to multivalency and preorganization enforced by the mechanical bond.

         <title>From Ketoesters, Diynes, and Arynes to Functionalized Pyranones, Naphthalenes, and Anthracenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel, regioselective approach enabling the synthesis of aryl&#8208;arylethynyl&#8208;arenes, including naphthalene and anthracene derivatives, via tandem [2&#160;+&#160;1&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;1] and subsequent [4&#160;+&#160;2] cycloadditions, has been discovered. The first step provides new 2&#8208;pyranones characterized by extensive conjugation as well as tunable optical and electrochemical properties. This approach opens new paths for further transformation of both pyranones and arenes.








Abstract
This study aimed to create new possibilities in the syntheses of aryl&#8208;arylethynyl&#8208;naphthalene and anthracene derivatives. Starting from simple structures, i.e., &#223;&#8208;ketoesters, 1,4&#8208;di(aryl, heteroaryl)buta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diynes, and arynes, via 5&#8208;aryl&#8208;4&#8208;(arylethynyl)pyran&#8208;2&#8208;ones, the target structures were successfully obtained by a simple procedure (in a one&#8208;pot or a two&#8208;step version). On the way to the final structures, an innovative and very effective synthetic method for obtaining aryl&#8208;arylethynyl&#8208;pyran&#8208;2&#8208;ones was developed. This unprecedented procedure turned out to be fully regioselective, namely only 5&#8208;aryl&#8208;4&#8208;(arylethynyl)&#8208;3,6&#8208;dimethylpyran&#8208;2&#8208;ones were obtained in the reaction involving ethyl 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;oxobutanoate and 1,4&#8208;diarylbuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyne mediated by a Re&#8208;catalyst. It seems that steric effects associated with the Re&#9472;C and C&#9472;C bond lengths play a decisive role with regard to the regioselectivity. Importantly, the aforementioned procedure is very simple, which makes it completely different from the only previously described procedure dedicated to structurally similar pyranones. Undoubtedly, such substituted 2&#8208;pyranones, naphthalenes, and anthracenes are practically unavailable via any other way, especially via such a simple and convenient synthetic route. All the newly obtained aryl&#8208;arylethynyl&#8208;pyran&#8208;2&#8208;ones and aryl&#8208;arylethynyl&#8208;arenes were fully characterized, including DFT calculations and thermal, optical, and electrochemical properties. The presence of a triple bond in the obtained compounds definitely changes their properties, especially in comparison to structures without a triple bond.

         <title>Boron Cluster Functionalization: From Vertex&#8208;Specific Modifications to Boron Cage Extension</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D extended molecular systems constructed from boron clusters have attracted considerable attention owing to their unique structures and properties. Recent advances in functionalizing boron clusters, particularly through methodologies such as boron cage extension to create hybrid polycyclic conjugates, have been reviewed. These studies present new synthetic strategies for assembling the intricate molecular architectures, while also emphasizing their potential in driving innovations across materials science and chemistry.








Abstract
Polycyclic molecular systems, which play a crucial role in the fields of materials science and pharmacology, typically consist of 2D extended organic aromatic rings. Extensive research has been conducted on conjugates formed through &#960;&#8208;extension, leading to substantial advancements in the field. However, further exploration of novel conjugate systems is essential. This is necessary to enhance structural diversity and facilitate the development of advanced applications. Boron clusters, such as carboranes, are 3D aromatic structures featuring multiple C/B&#8211;H bonds. The functionalization of these C/B&#8211;H bonds offers a pathway for constructing a diverse array of carborane derivatives. In recent years, the extension of boron cages through the functionalization of boron clusters to generate hybrid polycyclic conjugates has attracted significant attention due to the promising properties and applications of these molecules. This review highlights the progress in boron cage modifications and boron cage extension over the past few years. It focuses on synthetic strategies and structure&#8208;property relationships of these hybrid conjugates.

         <title>Gold Nanocluster&#8208;Based Luminescence Microcomposites by Interfacial Polymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent gold nanoclusters were spontaneously adsorbed at the oil/water interfaces, functioning as monomers in conjunction with hexamethylene diisocyanate during interfacial polymerization. This process results in the formation of gold nanocluster&#8208;based luminescence microcomposites. By incorporating appropriate dyes into the cavities, it is possible to achieve tunable luminescent colors, including the production of white light.








Abstract
Controlled interfacial polymerization in conventional or Pickering emulsions enables the precise fabrication of cavity&#8208;like architectures, providing a versatile platform for the composite construction. Fluorescent gold nanoclusters, acting as interfacial stabilizers, not only enhance emulsion stability but also simultaneously impart luminescent properties to the resulting composites. In this study, modified gold nanoclusters were used as one of the monomers in the interfacial polymerization process to prepare emulsions with fluorescent properties. These gold nanoclusters were localized on the droplet surfaces, forming spherical shell structures. To further enhance the functionality of these structures, we incorporated an additional fluorescent dye as a filler within the spherical shells, resulting in microcomposites with unique optical characteristics. The combination of two luminophores produced white luminescence, which could shift to different colors depending on the incident light. This innovative approach offers new possibilities for applications of advanced optical technologies.

A heavy&#8208;atom free BODIPY photosensitizer localizing in the endoplasmic reticulum that efficiently generates singlet&#8208;oxygen causing cell death upon light activation.








Abstract
The organelle&#8208;localized photodynamic therapy (PDT) has become a promising strategy for efficient cancer treatment. The photogeneration of reactive oxygen species in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) leads to lipid oxidation and causes cell apoptosis or necrosis. However, most of the commercially available ER&#8208;localized phototherapeutic agents exhibit dark cytotoxicity related to the presence of heavy atoms. In this contribution, we developed a novel heavy&#8208;atom free BODIPY photosensitizer that localizes selectively in the ER with good biocompatibility, small dark cytotoxicity and efficient singlet oxygen generation, causing cellular death in a PDT experiment. The molecular design of the BODIPY PS involves two key elements: (i) replacing of the common BF2 group with the 9&#8208;borafluorene which strongly enhances intersystem crossing to the triplet state responsible for photogeneration of singlet oxygen, and (ii) introduction of the pendant coumarin group ensuring ER&#8208;localization and serving as light&#8208;harvesting antenna for energy transfer to BODIPY core structure. The localization of BODIPY&#8208;based PS was confirmed by laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) imaging, and co&#8208;staining revealed strong localization within the ER.

         <title>Chiral Dominance in Supramolecular Co&#8208;assemblies via Cation&#8211;&#960; Driven Stereochemical Locking</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral dominance observed in binary assemblies composed of dibenzoyl&#8208;substituted tartaric acid (a1) and enantiomeric pyridine derivatives (R/S&#8208;py). Protonation of R/S&#8208;py enables a1 to override co&#8208;assembly chirality via in situ cation&#8208;&#960; interactions, inducing stereoconfiguration&#8208;locked H&#8208;aggregates.








Abstract
Controlling supramolecular chirality in multicomponent systems remains a significant challenge due to competing stereochemical interactions. In this study, we report a case of competitive chiral dominance in binary co&#8208;assemblies composed of enantiomeric tartaric acid derivatives (a1 and a2) and enantiomeric pyridine derivatives (R/S&#8208;py). The dibenzoyl&#8208;substituted tartaric acid (a1) is capable of overriding the chirality of the co&#8208;assemblies by protonating the chiral pyridines to form pyridinium&#8211;carboxylate pairs. This interaction induces in situ cation&#8211;&#960; interactions, leading to the formation of stereoconfiguration&#8208;locked H&#8208;aggregates. In contrast, the pivaloyl&#8208;substituted tartaric acid (a2) exhibits chirality bias governed by the enantiopure pyridine derivatives, attributed to its increased steric bulk and the absence of cation&#8211;&#960; interactions. These findings not only advance the fundamental understanding of stereochemical communication but also offer a new strategy for controlling hierarchical chirality in complex supramolecular systems.

         <dc:description>
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed non&#8208;directed C&#9472;H alkenylation of simple arenes with &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl styrene derivatives is accomplished using 2&#8208;pyridone ligands, which significantly enhances both yield and selectivity. This approach enables efficient functionalization across a wide range of arenes and styrene substrates. Mechanistic studies further clarify the reaction pathway.








Abstract
Herein, we report the palladium&#8208;catalyzed non&#8208;directed C&#9472;H functionalization reaction of simple arenes with &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl styrene derivatives. The application of 2&#8208;pyridone ligands increased the yield and selectivity of the alkenylation reaction and enabled a broad scope of different simple arenes and &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl styrenes (25 examples, up to 94% yield). Overall, a robust reaction is developed as described by a sensitivity screening. Detailed experimental studies on the reaction were performed to further understand the mechanism.

         <title>Conformational Transition of Viral Nucleic Acids in a Capsid&#8208;Like Confined Environment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Viruses encapsulate their nucleic acids within the confined ionic environment of the capsid that can be mimicked using reverse micelles (RMs). Smaller RMs preferentially stabilize the G&#8208;quadruplex structure, whereas larger RMs shift the equilibrium toward the hairpin conformation. Understanding this conformational transition provides a novel strategy for modulating regulatory mechanisms of viral genes and their impact on viral gene expression.








Abstract
Nucleic acid molecules within viral genomes can fold into noncanonical structures, such as G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s), which play crucial roles in regulating viral gene expression. These genomes are confined within capsid environments that vary in dimensions and ionic compositions. Structural transitions in RNA or DNA within these confined environments are essential for modulating viral biological functions; however, these transitions remain poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that an RNA sequence derived from the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV&#8208;1) genome adopts a dynamic equilibrium between G4 and hairpin (Hp) structures modulated by ionic conditions. The equilibrium shifts toward the G4 conformation in the presence of potassium (K&#8314;) and magnesium (Mg2&#8314;) ions. Using reverse micelles (RMs) as mimetics of the intracapsid environment, we showed that the size of the RM water pool influences significantly this equilibrium: smaller water pools favor G4 formation, whereas larger pools prefer the Hp structure owing to variations in the dielectric constant. Notably, the addition of Mg2&#8314; ions alters the size&#8208;dependent effects of RMs by stabilizing the G4 structure. These findings highlight the critical roles of environmental confinement and ionic conditions in regulating viral RNA structural dynamics, offering new insights into RNA&#8208;based regulatory mechanisms and their impact on viral gene expression.

         <title>Cover Feature: Tag&#8208;Assisted Liquid&#8208;Phase Oligonucleotide Synthesis: Toward a Convergent Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 41, July 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature shows a schematic impression of our soluble support&#8208;assisted liquid&#8208;phase oligonucleotide synthesis using a novel tag that can be prepared from commercially available methyl gallate without column chromatography. Selective tag cleavages with protective groups remaining are made possible under mild reducing conditions to prepare protected fragments, which are necessary to realize a convergent approach. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Chiba, Y. Okada and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202500616).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Cover Feature&lt;/b&gt; shows a schematic impression of our soluble support-assisted liquid-phase oligonucleotide synthesis using a novel tag that can be prepared from commercially available methyl gallate without column chromatography. Selective tag cleavages with protective groups remaining are made possible under mild reducing conditions to prepare protected fragments, which are necessary to realize a convergent approach.

The structure&#8208;activity relationship between the microstructure of MHPs and various photocatalytic properties was prospected, including excited state structural distortion, energy level rearrangement, and ion doping.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have shown significant promise in the realm of photocatalysis due to their distinctive optical and electrical properties. In this Perspective, we review the latest advancements in MHPs for photocatalysis, summarizing common modification methods aimed at enhancing photocatalytic efficiency and stability. We then highlight the changes in lattice and band structures exhibited by MHPs before and after photoexcitation, with a particular focus on the intricate and varied transformations observed in lead&#8208;free perovskite materials (LFPMs). By emphasizing the importance of these lattice and band changes, we demonstrate how they can be leveraged to construct effective heterostructures and rationally design and synthesize novel perovskite materials with robust photocatalytic capabilities. We hope that this perspective can offer researchers new insights into MHPs photocatalysis and advance the application of LFPMs in the field of photocatalysis.

         <title>The Ascent of Supramolecular Polymers and Gels in Asymmetric Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 41, July 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
SPs and gels emerged as modular platforms for asymmetric catalysis. This review ranks literature reports according to the achiral or chiral nature of the monomers bearing the catalytic site. New paradigms showcased by this approach are particularly highlighted, such as catalysts operating with a low amount of chiral inducers, or with no chiral inducer, and the development of switchable asymmetric catalysts.








Abstract
Supramolecular polymers (SPs) and gels, formed by the spontaneous assembly of small molecules through various types of noncovalent interactions, are attractive materials for many applications. Their modularity also offers many opportunities in asymmetric catalysis that have been tackled in the last two decades and more intensively in the last one. In this review, strategies adopted to develop efficient asymmetric catalysts supported on SPs and gels are first categorized according to the chiral or achiral nature of the monomers used for their construction and second to their ability to be commuted into different states. Catalytic SPs have been described for which enantioselectivity stems mostly from the molecular chirality located next to the reactive group, or at opposite ends of the spectrum, exclusively from the chiral environment provided by the supramolecular helices. New paradigms revealed by these systems include (i) the organization of catalytic sites at the periphery of modular and well&#8208;structured 1D assemblies, (ii) the possibility to conduct asymmetric reactions with a sub&#8208;catalytic amount of chiral inducers and even in the absence of chiral monomers, and (iii) the development of a new class of switchable asymmetric catalysts.

         <title>Understanding the SN2 Versus E2 Competition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 41, July 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We provide an intuitive framework rooted in quantitative molecular orbital theory to understand the factors that govern the competition between the SN2 and E2 reaction pathways. The guiding concepts are: characteristic distortivity, transition state acidity, intrinsic nucleophilicity, and apparent nucleophilicity.








Abstract
Bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2) and base&#8208;induced elimination (E2) generally compete, and it is, therefore, essential to be in control of this competition in synthetic organic chemistry. Herein, we establish guiding principles based on quantitative molecular orbital (MO) theory and the activation strain model to understand and tune the competition between the SN2 and E2 reactions. We discuss the role of key factors, such as the nature of the Lewis base, leaving group, substrate structure, and the solvent. To this end, we introduce the concepts of characteristic distortivity, transition state acidity, intrinsic nucleophilicity, and apparent nucleophilicity. These intuitive concepts equip chemists with conceptual tools to better understand and design reactions for organic synthesis.

         <title>Advances in Copper and Nickel C&#9472;N and C&#9472;O Cross&#8208;Couplings of (Hetero)Aryl Chlorides Enabled by Ancillary Ligand Development</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 41, July 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Important recent advances in ancillary ligand design that enable superlative copper or nickel catalyst systems for C&#9472;N or C&#9472;O cross&#8208;couplings of inexpensive and abundant (hetero)aryl chloride electrophiles under operationally simple thermal conditions are discussed.








Abstract
The evolution of palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;N and C&#9472;O cross&#8208;coupling chemistry into first&#8208;choice methods for the synthesis of aniline and phenol derivatives can be attributed to innovations in ancillary ligand design that facilitate challenging elementary steps of thermal catalysis. Inspired by this strategy, and in the quest to establish more sustainable thermal base metal catalysis that is competitive with and complementary to such precious metal protocols, several successful mechanism&#8208;inspired ancillary ligand classes for use in enabling high&#8208;performing copper and nickel catalysts have emerged over the last decade. In this Review we document key ancillary ligand advances of this type, with a focus on superlative copper and nickel catalysts that enable C&#9472;N or C&#9472;O cross&#8208;couplings of cheap and abundant (hetero)aryl chloride electrophiles under operationally simple conditions of relevance to end&#8208;users in academia and industry.

         <title>Fluorenyl Cations: Synthesis and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 41, July 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review covers the history of fluorenyl cations from Deno's first report in 1954 on the parent fluorenyl cation to the present. The parent cation and most derivatives have only been observed as a fleeting species by mass spectrometry, UV/Vis spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, or NMR spectroscopy while recent developments led to isolable species including two characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction.








Abstract
This review covers the history of fluorenyl cations from Deno's first report in 1954 on the parent fluorenyl cation to the present. The parent cation and most derivatives have only been observed as a fleeting species by mass spectrometry, UV/Vis spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, or NMR spectroscopy. The most common synthetic routes to fluorenyl cations are by dehydroxylation and halide abstraction of substituted fluorenyl precursors. Over the 71 year history, many advancements have been made with recent developments leading to isolable species including two characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction. The scope of this review covers the field of fluorenyl cations in addition to related species with different aromatic groups in place of benzene fused to the cycopentadienyl core.

         <title>Tag&#8208;Assisted Liquid&#8208;Phase Oligonucleotide Synthesis: Toward a Convergent Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 41, July 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report an effective soluble support&#8208;assisted liquid&#8208;phase oligonucleotide synthesis using a novel tag, which can be successfully prepared from commercially available methyl gallate without column chromatography. Selective tag cleavages with protective groups remain are made possible under mild reducing conditions to prepare protected fragments, which is necessary to realize a convergent approach.








Abstract
Although soluble support (tag)&#8208;assisted liquid&#8208;phase methods have found practical applications in peptide synthesis, they are still in their infancy for oligonucleotide synthesis. The development of techniques for selective tag cleavage with protective groups remaining is particularly important because such techniques are necessary to realize a convergent approach. Herein, we report an effective soluble support&#8208;assisted liquid&#8208;phase oligonucleotide synthesis using a novel tag that can be prepared from commercially available methyl gallate without column chromatography. Selective tag cleavages with protective groups remaining are made possible under mild reducing conditions to prepare protected fragments, which is necessary to realize a convergent approach.

         <title>Design of Potent Mannose&#8208;6&#8208;Phosphate Derivatives as Ligands for CI&#8208;M6P/IGF2R Using Fluorescence Polarization Assay</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 41, July 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed and synthesized novel mannose&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate (M6P) derivatives to enhance their binding affinity for the CI&#8208;M6P/IGF2 receptor, which plays a key role in lysosomal targeting. Using a fluorescence polarization assay, we evaluated di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and penta&#8208;M6P peptides and modified M6P analogs. Our results show that multivalent ligands significantly improve receptor binding, with phosphonate groups emerging as a promising stable alternative to native M6P








Abstract
The cation&#8208;independent mannose&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate/IGF2 receptor (CI&#8208;M6P/IGF2R) plays a crucial role in transporting lysosomal enzymes and other ligands. In this study, we designed and synthesized novel stable mannose&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate (M6P) derivatives to enhance their affinity for CI&#8208;M6P/IGF2R. To evaluate the binding potency, we employed a sensitive and cost&#8208;effective fluorescence polarization assay, enabling rapid quantification of receptor&#8211;ligand interactions in solution. The tested compounds included di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and penta&#8208;M6P peptides along with various M6P&#8208;derived small molecules featuring phosphate isosteres or other functional modifications. Our findings indicate that ligands bearing multiple M6P moieties exhibit significantly higher receptor affinities than monomeric compounds and that phosphonate groups may serve as a more stable and potent alternative to native M6P. Computational modeling of ligand interactions with the CI&#8208;M6P/IGF2R domains further elucidated the binding mechanisms, offering new directions for the development of more effective ligands. This study advances the design of therapeutic strategies that leverage CI&#8208;M6P/IGF2R for targeted biomolecule delivery to lysosomes, thereby opening new possibilities for biomedical applications.

         <title>Exploring the Impact of Phenanthroline&#8208;Based Glycoconjugated Ru(II) Polypyridyl Photosensitizers on Metastasis&#8208;Related Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 41, July 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel family of water&#8208;soluble, nontoxic, and phosphorescent N&#8208;glycosylated Ru(II) phenanthroline&#8208;based complexes are reported. They exhibit photoselectivity indexes ranging from 10 to 44 in PC&#8208;3 cells, while impacting cell migration and resistance to detachment after irradiation with blue light.








Abstract
Novel water&#8208;soluble, phosphorescent ruthenium(II) polypyridyl&#8208;glycoconjugates of general formula [Ru{N&#8208;(1,10&#8208;phenanthroline)}2{N&#8208;(1,10&#8208;phenanthrolin&#8208;5&#8208;yl)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glycopyranosylamine}][Cl]2 (glycopyranosyl&#160;=&#160;D&#8208;glucopyranosyl (1), D&#8208;mannopyranosyl (2), L&#8208;rhamnopyranosyl (3), L&#8208;xylopyranosyl (4), and 2,3,4&#8208;tri&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl&#8208;L&#8208;xylopyranosyl (5)) and corresponding aglycone [Ru{N&#8208;(1,10&#8208;phenanthroline)}2{N&#8208;(1,10&#8208;phenanthrolin&#8208;5&#8208;amine)}][Cl]2 (6) have been synthesized and fully characterized. Their stability and behavior in physiological media have been assessed using ultraviolet visible spectroscopy (UV&#8208;Vis) and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (&#185;H&#8208;NMR), revealing minor N&#8208;glycosidic cleavage and high photostability. The photocytotoxicity of the complexes has been evaluated in two different cancer (PC&#8208;3 and MCF&#8208;7) and one nontumorigenic (HFF&#8208;1) cell lines. While exhibiting no toxicity in the dark, some glycoconjugates achieve photoselectivity indexes of up to 40 upon blue&#8208;light irradiation. Remarkably, complexes 1&#8211;6 potently affect the metastatic phenotype of PC&#8208;3 cells, evidenced by the inhibition of migration in the wound healing assay and the increased resistance to trypsin detachment following photoactivation.

By introducing analogues of Trp in Ar/Trp cell&#8208;penetrating peptides, we investigated the role of this unique amino acid in the cell uptake and interaction with cell membrane partners using experimental and computational approaches.








Abstract
Cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) are small sequences that can cross cell membranes. Arg and Trp are highly prevalent amino acids in natural and synthetic efficient CPP sequences. In particular, Trp is essential and cannot be substituted by other hydrophobic or aromatic amino acids. The aim of the present study is to decipher the role of Trp in synthetic Arg/Trp CPP sequences. To do so, a small peptide library in which this residue was substituted by other natural or nonnatural amino acids was designed. Internalization of these peptides in cells was evaluated, and it appeared that combining aromaticity and hydrophobicity in the presence of Arg residues leads to enhanced internalization. The study of the interaction of these peptides with model lipid membranes revealed that the modulation of hydrophobicity promoted insertion in bilayers but had little impact on the binding affinity. On the other hand, more hydrophobic substitutes of Trp led to more favorable binding enthalpies to heparin. With density functional theory (DFT) analysis, we suggest that ion&#8208;pair&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions between the aromatic ring and the ion pair formed by the positively charged Arg and the negatively charged cell surface groups can be established and could be at the origin of the unique internalization properties of Trp&#8208;containing Arg&#8208;rich CPPs.

Ultrastable redox&#8208;acitve PPDA&#8208;TFPT&#8208;COF has been synthesized for sustainable energy storage, with more than 100% capacitance retention even after 5000 charging/discharging cycles during the electrochemical process.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with reversible redox&#8208;active units are promising materials for electrochemical energy storage devices. The highly extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated redox&#8208;active PPDA&#8208;TFPT&#8208;COF is synthesized via Schiff&#8208;base condensation between p&#8208;phenylenediamine (PPDA) and 2,4,6&#8208;tris&#8208;(p&#8208;formylphenoxy)1,3,5&#8208;triazine (TFPT) monomers. The ample redox active sites of PPDA&#8208;TFPT&#8208;COF enabled exceptional energy storage, achieving a maximum specific capacitance of 250 F g&#8722;1 and an energy density of 34.72&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 500&#160;W kg&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1 current density. The material demonstrated extraordinary cycling stability, retaining over 100% capacitance after 5000 cycles at 7 A g&#8722;1 current density. This superior performance is attributed to &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, abundant redox&#8208;active centers, and an efficient charge transport pathway, making it an ideal supercapacitor electrode material. The presence of diamine moieties enhanced conductivity, while redox&#8208;active imine sites facilitated hydrogen ion storage. Electrochemical investigations under acidic conditions revealed significant perturbations in the electronic structure, elucidating the redox charge storage mechanism. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further confirmed extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation in HOMO and LUMO orbitals, providing key insights into charge mobility. This study presents a novel strategy for designing redox&#8208;active COFs for high&#8208;performance pseudocapacitive energy storage.

This study describes a novel class of biologically active bimetallic Cu(II) compounds as cutting&#8208;edge antibiofilm agents with MBL inhibitory activity against the clinically isolated MDR gram&#8208;negative bacterium, Pa&#8208;CI&#8208;1. The as&#8208;synthesized Cu(II) compounds exhibited significantly high antibacterial and antibiofilm activity as established by multiple bioassays, including ex vivo applicability studies.

Abstract
In this research, a novel class of biologically active bimetallic Cu(II) compounds has been discovered as cutting&#8208;edge antibiofilm agents with metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactamase (MBL) inhibitory activity against the clinically isolated multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) gram&#8208;negative bacterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa&#8208;CI&#8208;1). As the traditional strategies for antibiotic development are proving inadequate against the swift evolution of bacterial resistance, there is an urgent need to establish novel antibacterial strategies with mechanism different from those of prevailing antibiotics. Thus, the 2,6&#8208;bis[N&#8208;{N&#8208;(carboxymethyl)&#8208;N&#8208;(pyridylmethyl)amine}methyl]&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenol (H3L)&#8208;incorporated three bimetallic Cu(II) compounds, [Cu2L(H2O)(Cl)]&#183;H2O (1), [Cu2L(H2O)(NO3)]&#183;H2O (2) and [Cu2L(H2O)(CH3CO2)]&#183;H2O (3) has been strategically designed and synthesized with an unsymmetrical coordination arrangement that synergistically modifies the electronic environment of Cu centers for the enhancement of antibacterial and antibiofilm activity. The electronic environment of Cu(II) and its adjoining atoms has been further modified by substituting Cl&#8722; in 1 by NO3&#8722; in 2 and CH3CO2&#8722; in 3. The standard nitrocefin assay disclosed that 1&#8211;3 significantly inhibited the activity of MBLs produced by Pa&#8208;CI&#8208;1 at the half minimum inhibitory concentration (1/2 MIC). Molecular docking study suggested an excellent propensity of these Cu compounds for binding with MBL&#8208;producing proteins such as Verona integron&#8208;encoded metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactamase (VIM&#8208;1), Sao Paulo metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactamase (SPM&#8208;1), imipenemase (IMP&#8208;1), AmpC, and New Delhi metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactamase (NDM&#8208;1). However, the best possible interaction was observed for VIM&#8208;1 protein. All three Cu(II) compounds displayed significantly high antibacterial and antibiofilm activity as established by multiple bioassays, including ex vivo applicability studies. However, 1 and 3 showed an outstanding activity with MIC values of 200 and 150 &#181;g/mL, respectively, in comparison to 2 with an MIC of 300 &#181;g/mL. They showed an exceptional combinatorial activity when examined with five different commercially accessible &#946;&#8208;lactam&#8208;based antibiotics, such as amoxicillin (AMX), chloramphenicol (CHL), cefotaxime (CTX), ceftriaxone (CTR), and cefoxitin (CX) against Pa&#8208;CI&#8208;1. It has been suggested that the as&#8208;synthesized Cu compounds also blocked the activity of MBLs via strong interactions with the active sites of enzymes, thus restoring the normal activity of the antibiotics. Our study disclosed that 1&#8211;3 could be the emergent drug leads and attract great attention to the materials and biological chemists, combating antimicrobial resistance (AMR).

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly, Aggregation Mechanisms, and Morphological Properties of Asymmetric Perylene Diimide&#8208;based Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 41, July 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric PDI derivatives, bearing similar OEG chains and increasing numbers of hydrophobic alkyl chains were used to investigate changes in hydrophobicity on the properties of the resulting SMPs in solvent mixtures. Temperature&#8208;dependent UV/Vis studies showed a transition from an isodesmic to a cooperative assembly mechanism with increasing hydrophobicity. Tuning molecular structure leads to tuneable self&#8208;assembled structures and mechanisms of assembly.








Abstract
The ability to control the self&#8208;assembly behavior of functional molecules offers pathways for optimizing their properties and structures for targeted applications. Asymmetric perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives, bearing similar oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) chains and increasing numbers of hydrophobic alkyl chains were used to investigate the effects of hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups on the properties of the resulting supramolecular polymers (SMPs). Tetrahydrofuran/water (THF/H2O) mixtures were found to be an optimal system to induce the self&#8208;assembly behavior of these asymmetric PDI derivatives; the behavior of these new systems was monitored by recording ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV/Vis) spectra and analyzing changes in absorbance intensity. Temperature&#8208;dependent UV/Vis studies yielded thermodynamic parameters for the self&#8208;assembly processes and showed a transition from an isodesmic to a cooperative assembly mechanism with an increase in the number of hydrophobic alkyl chains. Detailed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) investigations revealed the formation of nanofiber&#8208;based supramolecular structures that exhibit a coiling tendency during their assembly process accompanied by the increase in the number (and total volume) of hydrophobic alkyl chains. Exploring these carefully tuned asymmetric PDI systems provides new opportunities to tune not only self&#8208;assembled structures, but also mechanisms of assembly.

Asymmetric perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives, bearing similar oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) chains and increasing numbers of hydrophobic alkyl chains were used to investigate the effects of hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups on the properties of the resulting supramolecular polymers (SMPs). Tetrahydrofuran/water (THF/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) mixtures were found to be an optimal system to induce the self-assembly behavior of these asymmetric PDI derivatives; the behavior of these new systems was monitored by recording ultraviolet-visible (UV/Vis) spectra and analyzing changes in absorbance intensity. Temperature-dependent UV/Vis studies yielded thermodynamic parameters for the self-assembly processes and showed a transition from an isodesmic to a cooperative assembly mechanism with an increase in the number of hydrophobic alkyl chains. Detailed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) investigations revealed the formation of nanofiber-based supramolecular structures that exhibit a coiling tendency during their assembly process accompanied by the increase in the number (and total volume) of hydrophobic alkyl chains. Exploring these carefully tuned asymmetric PDI systems provides new opportunities to tune not only self-assembled structures, but also mechanisms of assembly.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Supramolecular System of Bioactive Ionic Liquid, Peony Extract, and Peptide for Enhanced Permeability and Synergistic Skincare Benefits</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 41, July 22, 2025. </description>

This study presents a sustainable supramolecular system composed of naturally derived ingredients: PE, AHP8, and a bioactive ionic liquid from betaine and MA, which offers multiple anti&#8208;aging benefits while promoting skin permeability.








Abstract
The growing demand for safe and sustainable cosmetics has led to a marked inclination toward natural extracts and peptides as raw materials. In this study, we developed a sustainable system with multiple antiaging effects by combining peony extract (PE) and acetyl hexapeptide&#8208;8 (AHP8) to simultaneously treat static and dynamic wrinkles, as well as skin dullness. As the poor skin permeability of AHP8 limited its efficacy, we used a bioactive ionic liquid derived from betaine and malic acid (MA) ([Bet][MA]) as a permeation enhancer. In vitro and in vivo zebrafish experiments indicated that [Bet][MA] not only significantly enhances transdermal and cellular penetration, but also exerts synergistic anti&#8208;aging effects. While being biosafe, [Bet][MA] significantly increased the transdermal permeation, skin retention, and cellular uptake of AHP8. Theoretical calculations revealed that [Bet][MA] improved the anti&#8208;wrinkle and whitening efficacies of AHP8 and PE through supramolecular interactions; it modulated their electron cloud distribution and molecular polarity and thus intensified their affinity to target proteins. The supramolecular PE/AHP8/[Bet][MA] system demonstrated excellent radical&#8208; and reactive oxygen species&#8208;scavenging capability, collagen production, and tissue repair capability while concurrently inhibiting tyrosinase activity, motion signaling, and inflammation. The study findings pave the way for sustainable and multifunctional skincare solutions.

Abstract
[{Cp'Fe(&#956;&#8208;I)}2] (I; Cp&#8217; = &#951;5&#8211;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2) reacts with [Na(OCP)(1,4&#8208;dioxane)x] and K(OCAs) to yield [(Cp'Fe)2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;P2)(&#956;&#8208;CO)] (1) and [(Cp'Fe)2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;As2)(&#956;&#8208;CO)] (3), respectively. While complex 1 was previously accessed by Scherer and co&#8208;workers using rather harsh reaction conditions, the new synthetic method already proceeds at ambient temperature. UV&#8208;light irradiation of 1 and 3 induces CO release forming complexes [(Cp'Fe)2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;E2)] (E&#160;=&#160;P (2) and As (4)), respectively. However, both reactions also yielded several byproducts which were spectroscopically identified. Furthermore, upon thermally triggered CO elimination from 3 the Fe3As6&#8208;cluster [(Cp'Fe)3(As3)2] (5) is isolated in low yield. In addition, zero&#8208;field 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectra were recorded on complexes 1&#8211;4 and computational studies complement the experimental findings and provide additional insights into the bonding in these complexes and the reaction pathways resulting in the formation of complexes 1&#8211;4.

The impact of incorporating an auxiliary donor (4&#8208;methoxyethynyl moiety) into the PTZ structure on key physicochemical properties&#8212;such as thermal, optical, and electrochemical characteristics&#8212;as well as on the photovoltaic performance of DSSC devices was investigated. The study was further supported by theoretical calculations.








Abstract
A new donor&#8208;donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;3&#8208;(7&#8208;(2&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)ethynyl)&#8208;10&#8208;ethyl&#8208;10H&#8208;phenothiazin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)acrylic acid (PEDCA) has been synthesized in good yield and was characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectroscopies. The obtained phenothiazine (PTZ) derivative was explored in dye&#8208;sensitized and tandem dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (TDSCs). For reference purposes, the devices based on commercial organometallic dye N719 and a similar PTZ&#8208;based dye but without auxiliary donor and ethynyl &#960;&#8208;spacer, that is, 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;3&#8208;(10&#8208;ethyl&#8208;10H&#8208;phenothiazin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)acrylic acid (PEC) were used. The experimental results had also been supported by theoretical calculations performed by employing density functional theory. It was observed that the presence of an auxiliary donor and an ethynyl &#960;&#8208;spacer in PTZ unexpectedly decreased the molar absorption coefficient. However, this modification positively influenced the dye loading on the photoanode, which led to a 37% increase in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the dye&#8208;sensitized solar cell (DSSC) compared to the device sensitized with PEC. Further modifications to the device architecture allowed to obtain DSSC with efficiency above 7%. Despite the fact that the molar absorption coefficients of the PEC solution were higher compared to the PEDCA solution, the key issue is the number of dye molecules, which determines the photocurrent obtained, as shown in the following studies.

         <title>Diethenyl Sulfoximine (DESI) as an Irreversible Lysine&#8208;Targeting Warhead Enables the Design of Covalent Allosteric EGFR Inhibitor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 41, July 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
DESI is a novel lysine covalent warhead with moderate reactivity and hydrolytic stability, which can form a stable six&#8208;membered cyclic adduct with lysine. DESI&#8208;derived EGFR allosteric inhibitor&#160;4&#160;selectively modifies the catalytic lysine K745, thus potently inhibiting the activity of EGFRL858R/T790M/C797S kinase and corresponding engineered BaF3 cell proliferation as a single agent.








Abstract
Targeting lysine residues with covalent inhibitors is challenging due to their abundance in the proteome and the protonation of lysine's &#949;&#8208;amino group, which diminishes its reactivity. This study introduces diethenyl sulfoximine (DESI) as a novel bio&#8208;orthogonal aminophilic electrophile that can react with lysine via double conjugate addition to form a cyclic adduct. The second addition promotes the entire and efficient electrophilic attack by the &#949;&#8208;amino of lysine on the ethenyl groups. DESI exhibits superior aqueous stability, overcoming the hydrolysis issue encountered by most reported lysine&#8208;targeting covalent agents. Incorporation of DESI in the allosteric pocket binder EAI045 of oncoprotein epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) yields compound 4, which specifically reacts to the catalytic lysine (Lys745). Compound 4 showed potent inhibition of EGFR&#8208;driven cell proliferation with IC50 values of 0.789&#160;&#181;M and 1.22&#160;&#181;M in engineered BaF3&#8208;EGFRL858R/T790M/C797S and NCI&#8208;H1975 cells, respectively, overcoming EAI045's limitation of lack of cellular potency as a single agent. Tyrosine kinases (TKs) panel profiling confirmed selectivity toward mutant EGFR while sparing the wild type with minimal off&#8208;targets. These findings highlight DESI's potential as a versatile strategy for targeting lysine residues irreversibly, offering solutions to overcome drug resistance in cancer therapy and advance next&#8208;generation precision medicines.

         <title>An Anionic Vanadium Thionitrosyl Complex Supported by an Anilide&#8208;Bis(aryloxide) Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 41, July 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anionic vanadium thionitrosyl complex was prepared by reaction of a vanadium nitrido complex with elemental sulfur. The thionitrosyl complex can be formally described as a vanadium(V) complex coordinated by a [NS]3&#8722; ligand, with a significant contribution from a thio&#8208;imido resonance form. The thionitrosyl complex was shown to react with a variety of substrates at the thionitrosyl sulfur atom and across the V&#8211;N bond.








Abstract
Reaction of [{K(dme)}{(ONO)V&#8801;N}]2 ([ONO]3&#8722; = anilide&#8208;bis(aryloxide)) with elemental sulfur afforded an anionic thionitrosyl complex [K(dme)4][(ONO)V(NS)], which could be isolated as a dark red solid. The solid&#8208;state metrical parameters suggest that it is best described with a thio&#8208;imido resonance form. The thionitrosyl complex was shown to react with a variety of substrates at the thionitrosyl sulfur atom and across the V&#8211;N bond. Reaction with PPh3 occurred with sulfur atom transfer to form the nitride and SPPh3. The thionitrosyl complex underwent S&#8208;alkylation with alkyl halides to form a sulfenylimido complex [(ONO)V(NSR)] (R&#160;=&#160;Me, CH2C6H4&#8208;4&#8208;Me). Reactions with Me3SiCl and BPh3 resulted in the formation of [(ONO)V(NSiMe3)] and [K(dme)4][(ONO)V(NBPh3)] along with concomitant loss of sulfur. When treated with CO2, CS2, and PhNCS, the reactions took place across the V&#8211;N bond to generate [(ONO)VE] (E&#160;=&#160;O, S). The thionitrosyl complex was unstable in toluene and underwent dimerization via loss of K2S to afford [{(ONO)V}2(&#956;&#8208;NSN)]. Reaction of the thionitrosyl complex with [Cp2Fe][PF6] gave a mixture of products containing the NSN complex and [{(ONO)V}2(&#956;&#8208;NSSN)].

         <title>Development of CPA&#8208;Catalyzed &#946;&#8208;Selective Reductive Amination of Cardenolides for the Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Hydrolytically Stable Analogs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 41, July 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a new method to produce hydrolytically stable cardiotonic steroids using a CPA&#8208;controlled diastereoselective reductive amination of cardenolide aglycones. The oleandrin and digitoxigenin analogs exhibited promising activity against various cancer cell lines in the NCI&#8208;60 screen. Additionally, nanomolar concentrations of a new oleandrin analog lowered levels of the cellular prion protein in T98G cells.








Abstract
This article describes the development of novel, hydrolytically stable cardiotonic steroid analogs featuring a 3&#946;&#8208;amine moiety instead of the commonly found 3&#946;&#8208;carbohydrates such as oleandrose. To establish the desired 3&#946;&#8208;configuration stereoselectively, a new method based on chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;controlled diastereoselective reductive amination with Hantzsch esters was developed. This method utilizes readily available unsubstituted (S)&#8208;BINOL&#8208;based hydrogen phosphate as the catalyst, enabling the synthesis of 13 different 5&#946;&#8208;androsterone and digitoxigenin analogs with up to 36:1&#160;&#946;:&#945; diastereoselectivity. Additionally, this strategy was applied to generate two novel oleandrigenin analogs 15a and 15g in 3 steps from readily available gitoxigenin. The synthetic analogs were subjected to the NCI&#8208;60 human tumor cell lines screen, and several different digitoxigenin derivatives with tumor cell growth inhibitory power in submicromolar range were identified. The subsequent in vitro evaluation of digitoxigenin and oleandrin derivatives 13a, 13g, 15a, and 15g demonstrated that these four analogs reduced steady&#8208;state ATP1A1 levels in T98G cells in the 12&#8211;96&#160;nM range. Interestingly, only the oleandrin analog 15g lowered also steady&#8208;state levels of the cellular prion protein (PrPC), the main therapeutic target for the treatment of prion diseases.

We report electrophilic ring&#8208;opening halogenation of pyrazolopyridines and isoxazoles. Selective cleavage of C&#9472;N or N&#9472;O bonds enables the synthesis of tertiary chlorinated and brominated compounds under mild conditions.








Abstract
We report the development of electrophilic ring&#8208;opening chlorination and bromination reactions of pyrazoloazines and isoxazoles using chlorinating and brominating agents. These transformations proceed via selective cleavage of heteroaromatic N&#9472;N or N&#9472;O bonds, delivering structurally diverse tertiary halogenated compounds. Furthermore, treatment of formylated pyrazolopyridines with two equivalents of chlorinating or brominating agents afforded dihalogenated products in good yields. This strategy represents a valuable platform for constructing halogenated scaffolds from simple heteroaromatic precursors and broadens the synthetic utility of skeletal transformations in the functionalization of heteroaromatics.

         <title>Nucleophilic Addition versus Migratory Insertion Pathways in the Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Heck Reaction: A Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 41, July 22, 2025. </description>

The &#8220;gold&#8208;catalyzed Heck reaction&#8221; could in principle proceed either via nucleophilic attack by triflate, or by migratory alkene insertion. This DFT study shows that nucleophilic attack is strongly preferred but ligand dependent.








Abstract
The initial reaction steps in the formation of Heck&#8208;type arylated alkenes catalyzed by P^N chelated Au(III) complexes have been studied computationally. Two mechanistic alternatives have been explored: (1) alkene coordination and insertion into a gold&#8208;carbon bond, and (2) nucleophilic attack on a gold(III) alkene adduct. The common starting point, the [(P^N)AuPh(alkene)]2+ dication (alkene&#160;=&#160;C2H4, H2C&#9552;CHEt, or H2C&#9552;CEt2), shows unequal bonding to the olefinic carbons of the 1&#8208;alkenes (P^N&#160;=&#160;1,2&#8208;C6H4NMe2(PR2); R&#160;=&#160;H, Me, 1&#8208;adamantyl). This polarization increases with steric hindrance and with the inclusion of an OTf&#8208; anion in the model. While the reaction pathways are strongly governed by the trans&#8208;influence of the ligand, the effects of steric hindrance in the ligand and alkene are remarkably small. In all cases the nucleophilic attack pathway is energetically favored. However, changing the ligand from a P^N to a P^P chelate, with a strongly electron&#8208;donating &#8208;PMe2 donor trans to Ph, sufficiently destabilizes the Au&#9472;Ph bond to make alkene insertion competitive. Alkene 1,2&#8208;insertion regiochemistry is always preferred, unlike Pd&#8208;catalyzed Heck reaction that requires a 2,1&#8208;insertion. Based on these results, an alkene insertion pathway en route to Heck&#8208;type olefins can therefore be ruled out.

         <title>Double&#8208;Click Strategy Combining CuAAC and (Thia&#8208;) Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions; Application Toward Peptide Labeling</title>

A double click&#8208;strategy combining copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition with (thia&#8208;)Diels&#8208;Alder reactions involving a reactive s&#8208;cis&#8208;constrained diene is reported. Three different one&#8208;pot protocols (i.e., sequential or three&#8208;component reactions) are proposed and offer valuable guidance for future applications. The reactions are performed under mild conditions (37 &#176;C in H2O/iPrOH for 1&#8208;2&#160;hours) and can afford the desired bioconjugates in good overall isolated yields. Successfully applied on small peptides, the method demonstrates its efficiency and interest toward applications in chemical biology.








Abstract
We report an efficient double&#8208;click strategy combining copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) with (thia&#8208;)Diels&#8211;Alder (DA) reactions, enabled by newly designed heterobifunctional platforms bearing orthogonal clickable groups: alkyne&#8211;dithioester, alkyne&#8211;maleimide, or azide&#8211;diene. These platforms were evaluated through both one&#8208;pot sequential protocols (CuAAC/DA or CuAAC/thia&#8208;DA) and three&#8208;component reactions (3CR), using model substrates with complementary functionalities. The use of a highly reactive s&#8208;cis&#8208;constrained exocyclic diene, enabled rapid cycloadditions with maleimide or phosphonodithioester dienophiles. All reactions were performed under mild, biocompatible conditions (37&#160;&#176;C, 1:1 H&#8322;O/iPrOH, 1&#8211;2&#160;hours), and most afforded the desired conjugates in good isolated yields. The methodology was further validated through the successful bioconjugation of three small peptides with either a fluorophore or biotin, demonstrating its efficiency, versatility, and compatibility with biologically relevant functional groups.

         <title>Ca2+ Stabilized by Carborate Anions: Synthesis, Structure, and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 41, July 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium salts consisting of Ca2+ weakly coordinated by carborate counterions have been prepared through anhydrous and aqueous methods. The Ca2+ center is sufficiently Lewis acidic to weakly coordinate olefins, alkynes and aromatics, and catalyze the hydrosilylation of 1&#8208;hexene and several alkynes.








Abstract
The syntheses of calcium carborates, Ca[HexCB11Cl11]2, 1, Ca[HCB11Cl11]2, 2, and Ca[MeCB11Cl11]2&#183;2(o&#8208;DFB), 3&#183;2(o&#8208;DFB), (o&#8208;DFB&#160;=&#160;1,2&#8208;difluorobenzene) including the structure of 2&#183;4(o&#8208;DFB) are described. The large size of the Ca2+ cation is reflected by the coordination geometry with the Ca center being coordinated by three Cl donors from each of the carborate anions and one F donor from each of the two coordinated solvent molecules. Based on 11B NMR and DOSY NMR studies, the salts 1, 2 and 2&#183;2(o&#8208;DFB) form close ion pairs in PhBr and o&#8208;DFB solutions. The Fluoride Ion Affinities (FIA) in PhBr for the salts 1 and 2&#183;2(o&#8208;DFB) were DFT&#8208;calculated (&#969;B97XD/6&#8211;31&#160;+&#160;G**) at 211.3&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 and 217.5&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1, respectively, which is below that of the landmark Lewis acid B(C6F5)3 (241.5&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1). The Ca2+ center in salt 1 is sufficiently Lewis acidic to coordinate 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene (1,5&#8208;COD) and 2,6&#8208;octadiyne and to catalyze the hydrosilylation of 1&#8208;hexene and several alkynes, albeit slowly. Compound 1 also displays moderate activity as a catalyst for transfer hydrogenation catalysis and carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis (COM), a first for Ca compounds.

         <title>Electrochemical Oxidative Radical Polar Crossover Route to 1,4&#8208;Keto Carboxylates Mediated by Anchimeric Assistance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 41, July 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work we developed an electrochemical method for 1,4&#8208;dioxygenated compounds, offering broad scope, functional group compatibility, and diastereoselectivity.








Abstract
The 1,4&#8208;keto carboxylate scaffold is present in the structure of many biologically relevant compounds. To date, there are only a branch of methods to prepare them, using either transition metal catalysts, or noncommercially available and sensitive starting materials. Herein, we describe a sustainable electrochemical methodology starting from commercially available and highly stable 1,3&#8208;diketones and alkenes to prepare 1,4&#8208;keto aryl and alkyl carboxylates in a highly efficient manner, without the need of an external catalyst or harsh reaction conditions. This electrochemical oxidative radical polar crossover transformation presents a broad scope, is compatible with many functional groups, and can even be applied in flow chemistry. In addition, the key stabilization of the intermediate carbocation by anchimeric assistance allows a high diastereo&#8208; and regio&#8208;control of the reaction. Moreover, the utility of these 1,4&#8208;keto carboxylates was demonstrated in several derivatizations and applications in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive compounds.

         <title>Nitrile Hydroboration by Cooperative Iron Catalysis: An Experimental and Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 41, July 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe the Fe&#8208;catalyzed double hydroboration of nitriles using HBpin as the terminal reductant. Mechanistic studies, both experimental and computational, reveal a unique and unreported mechanistic pathway for iron&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration where reductive elimination, rather than B&#9472;H bond activation is the rate&#8208; limiting step.








Abstract
Reductive amination is a challenging reaction in catalysis that often gives poor yield and selectivity. We present an iron&#8208;catalyzed approach of synthesizing amines through reduction of nitriles through hydroboration with good yield under ambient conditions. Our detailed mechanistic study establishes the factors that influence the selectivity and turnover. The kinetics and mechanism of the iron&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration of benzonitrile to bis(boryl)benzylamine have been investigated by initial rates, temperature dependence, kinetic isotope effects, and computational studies. In contrast to other iron&#8208;catalyzed nitrile hydroboration, this study reveals that B&#9472;H bond activation is not rate&#8208;determining. Moreover, the rate&#8208;determining step was revealed to be C&#9472;H bond reductive elimination with an equilibrium isotope effect in operation. Through this combined approached, an Fe(0)/(II) catalytic manifold proceeding via metal&#8208;ligand cooperativity has been determined.

         <title>Synthesis of Cyclopentadienyl Rhodium Catalysts by Co&#8208;Cyclization of Two Different Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 41, July 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various rhodium catalysts with densely substituted pi&#8208;ligands have been synthesized in one step by selective co&#8208;cyclization of two alkynes. Tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;acetylene typically gives cyclopentadienyl ligands, whereas trimethylsilyl&#8208;acetylene produces pentalene&#8208;type structures. The resulting complexes catalyze regioselective C&#9472;H activation and annulation of arylhydroxamic acids.








Abstract
Cyclopentadienyl rhodium complexes (C5R5)RhLx are widely used as homogeneous catalysts. Herein we report the synthesis of such complexes with structurally diverse cyclopentadienyl ligands in one step directly from alkynes. Specifically, reactions of bulky terminal alkynes (tert&#8208;butylacetylene or trimethylsilylacetylene) with activated internal alkynes (ethyl 2&#8208;butynoate or dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (DMAD)) and [(cod)RhCl]2 produce either cyclopentadienyl or pentalene&#8208;type complexes (L)Rh(cod) in 60&#8211;95% yields. Oxidation of these Rh(I) complexes with halogens afforded the corresponding Rh(III) derivatives [(L)RhHal2]2, which can catalyze C&#9472;H activation of phenylhydroxamate, giving products with varying regioselectivity depending on the substituents in pi&#8208;ligands.

         <title>Reassessing the Possibility of &#960;&#8211;&#963;&#8211;&#960; Full Electron Delocalization Through 3D Aromatic Carboranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 41, July 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic carborane clusters interact with &#960;&#8208;systems primarily through local negative hyperconjugation. This interaction is highly dependent on the cluster's size and symmetry. Significant through&#8208;cage delocalization occurs mainly in radical species, though similar behavior can also be observed in simple hydrocarbons.








Abstract
Over the past few decades, considerable attention has been devoted to explore the electronic interactions of various substituents with 3D aromatic carboranes. In the case of substituents possessing available p&#8208;orbitals, conjugation between the &#960;&#8208;system and the &#963;&#8208;framework of the carborane is possible via negative hyperconjugation, where electron density from a filled &#960;&#8208;orbital overlaps with an adjacent &#963;* orbital. However, this is inherently a local effect, which was further bolstered by the fact that aromatic conjugation between planar (2D) &#960;&#8208;systems and the 3D aromatic carborane cage does not exist. Nevertheless, recent studies have raised the intriguing possibility that 3D aromatic carboranes may function as &#963;&#8208;conjugated bridges, enabling electronic communication between spatially separated &#960;&#8208;systems. Herein, we investigated the potential conjugation of various substituents with or through carborane systems to better understand the nature of the possible interaction. We demonstrated that significant delocalization through the carborane cluster can be achieved only in the case of radical systems; however, this type of interaction is not a unique feature of carboranes, as similar behavior can also be observed in saturated hydrocarbons.

         <title>A Polymer&#8208;Oriented Synthesis Of Triazinyl Functionalized Mesoporous Organic Polymer Encapsulating Uitrafine Metal Clusters for Alkynes Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation</title>

A polymer&#8208;oriented synthesis strategy is firstly proposed for the synthesis of triazinyl functionalized mesoporous organic polymer. Pd@TRI&#8208;MOP exhibits exceptional catalytic performance in semi&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynes.








Abstract
Preparation of highly dispersed ultrafine metal clusters (MCs)&#8208; based catalysts with good stability and preeminent catalytic performance is a challenging problem for heterogeneous catalysis. Herein, we design and controllably synthesize a triazinyl functionalized mesoporous organic polymer (TRI&#8208;MOP) through a polymer&#8208;oriented synthesis strategy using polyethyleneimine (PEI) as pore&#8208;forming agent. The obtained TRI&#8208;MOP material possesses abundant worm&#8208;like mesopores, rich triazinyl groups, and high stability. Ultrafine Pd clusters with a small size (&#8776;0.76&#160;nm) are successfully anchored in the mesoporous channel of TRI&#8208;MOP by a simple impregnation&#8208;reduction approach. The as&#8208;prepared Pd@TRI&#8208;MOP catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic activity (96%) and selectivity (97%) in the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of phenylacetylene under very mild reaction conditions. The exceptional performance of Pd@TRI&#8208;MOP catalyst is attributed to the small size effect of Pd clusters, the electron coupling effect between the supports and the Pd and enriched meso&#8208;scaled pores. Therefore, this work provides a new platform for designing and preparing stable functional porous organic polymer materials to confine size&#8208;controlled MCs with superior catalytic performance for diversified potential catalysis applications.

         <title>Synthesis and Self&#8208;Assembly of a Discotic Oligo&#8208;Carboxylate Tetra&#8208;Porphyrin&#8208;Perylenebisimide Amphiphile</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report on the synthesis of a new amphiphilic tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;porphyrin PBI pentad. The pentads are characterized by quenching of the fluorescence emission, indicating efficient photo&#8208;induced charge&#8208;transfer. The amphiphiles show solubility in basic aqueous solutions of THF, where high water contents lead to a PBI&#8208;centered aggregation. TEM imaging reveals the morphology as randomly coiled sheets consisting out of highly regular assemblies.








Abstract
We report the synthesis of an amphiphilic tetra&#8208;porphyrin perylenebisimide (PBI) conjugate via four&#8208;fold Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling at the PBI ortho&#8208;position. Oligo&#8208;carboxylate Newkome&#8208;type G1 dendrons attached at the porphyrin periphery serve as polar head groups. Theoretical modelling corroborated the assumed planar discotic geometry. The amphiphile is very soluble in mixtures of basic water and THF, where it displays strong aggregation at high water content. Insights into the self&#8208;assembly process were obtained by tracking the individualization through THF addition using UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy. Here, a PBI&#8208;centred aggregation motif becomes evident. Further evaluation of the morphology via STEM and TEM imaging reveals that the assembly is guided by hydrophobic interactions as well as interactions of the carboxylates. These ortho&#8208;linked tetra&#8208;porphyrin PBI architectures fill a gap within the known families of porphyrin&#8208;PBI conjugates. Furthermore, the amphiphile is a valuable addition to the library of amphiphilic porphyrin&#8208;PBI conjugates, representing a discotic counterpart to the known calamitic architectures.

The amphiphiles show solubility in basic aqueous solutions of THF, where high water contents lead to a PBI-centered aggregation. TEM imaging reveals the morphology as randomly coiled sheets consisting out of highly regular assemblies.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the synthesis of an amphiphilic &lt;i&gt;tetra&lt;/i&gt;-porphyrin perylenebisimide (PBI) conjugate via four-fold Suzuki cross-coupling at the PBI &lt;i&gt;ortho-&lt;/i&gt;position. Oligo-carboxylate Newkome-type G1 dendrons attached at the porphyrin periphery serve as polar head groups. Theoretical modelling corroborated the assumed planar discotic geometry. The amphiphile is very soluble in mixtures of basic water and THF, where it displays strong aggregation at high water content. Insights into the self-assembly process were obtained by tracking the individualization through THF addition using UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy. Here, a PBI-centred aggregation motif becomes evident. Further evaluation of the morphology via STEM and TEM imaging reveals that the assembly is guided by hydrophobic interactions as well as interactions of the carboxylates. These &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-linked &lt;i&gt;tetra&lt;/i&gt;-porphyrin PBI architectures fill a gap within the known families of porphyrin-PBI conjugates. Furthermore, the amphiphile is a valuable addition to the library of amphiphilic porphyrin-PBI conjugates, representing a discotic counterpart to the known calamitic architectures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tuning the Transparency and Exciton Transition of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D Type Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Literature&#8208;based molecule preselection has been combined with TDDFT calculations to enhance the discovery of transparent organic small molecules. 54 candidates featuring a D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D architecture were identified, and 24 molecules were selected for synthesis based on their favorable transparency. Among them, 6 molecules exhibit broad optical windows with selective absorption in the UV and NIR regions.








Abstract
Organic small molecules possess significant potential for semitransparent optoelectronic applications due to their tunable optical properties and inherent transparency. However, tailoring these materials is challenging as their optoelectronic properties are sensitive to subtle structural changes, compounded by the existence of over a million potential structural designs. To address these complexities, we present a material discovery workflow that combines literature&#8208;based molecule preselection with TDDFT calculations, creating customized small molecule structures with adjustable transparency windows. We identified fifty&#8208;four small molecules with a D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D architecture, incorporating nine central (A) and six end (D) units connected by a thiophene &#960;&#8208;bridge. Through TDDFT calculations, we determined the theoretical absorption spectra and energy levels of the identified molecules. Ultimately, we synthesized twenty&#8208;four molecules that exhibit promising transparency properties by selectively absorbing photons in the ultraviolet (UV) and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) regions, with a significant optical transmission band relevant to the visible spectrum, which we will refer to as &#8220;optical window&#8221;. Characterization of the resultant small molecules revealed that six of them, in particular, exhibited selective absorption with the broadest &#8220;optical window&#8221;. We believe that our study will provide valuable insights to establish an effective material discovery workflow for highly transparent conjugated organic small molecules.

Although octupolar and quadrupolar DMAQ&#8208;derived probes showed superior &#949; and two&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;section (&#963;2) values relative to the dipolar one (1), the fragmentation efficiency exhibited inverse trend, and 1 emerged as the most effective caging group achieving Q&#160;=&#160;12% quantum yield with &#963;2&#160;=&#160;86 GM and uncaging cross&#8208;section &#948;u&#160;=&#160;10.2 GM at 735&#160;nm.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;branched probes based on 2&#8208;hydroxymethylene 8&#8208;dimethylaminoquinoline (8&#8208;DMAQ) and triphenylamine (TPA) have been synthesized and compared under UV and femtosecond near&#8208;infrared two&#8208;photon (2P) activation conditions. While octupolar (3) and quadrupolar (2) DMAQ derivatives showed superior &#949; and 2P absorption cross&#8208;section (&#963;2) values relative to the dipolar (1) probe, the fragmentation efficiency exhibited an inverse correlation with the enhanced absorption. Compound 1 emerged as the most effective probe reported to date for the release of organic substrates under both UV and 2P activation conditions at wavelengths accessible to commercially available lasers, achieving a quantum yield (Q) of 12% with &#963;2&#160;=&#160;86 GM and uncaging cross&#8208;section &#948;u&#160;=&#160;10.2 GM at 735&#160;nm.

         <title>Chalcogen&#8208;Guided Control of Azoarene Photoswitching: Tuning Excited&#8208;State Energies Through Electronic Property Modulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photophysical properties of ortho&#8208;tellurium&#8208;substituted azoarenes are tunable via aryl substituent electronics and tellurium oxidation state. Electron&#8208;donating groups destabilize the excited state three&#8208;electron &#963; bond, enhancing photoisomerization. Oxidation removes the tellurium lone pair required for the described interaction, further boosting switching.








Abstract
In recent years, chalcogen bonding has emerged as a promising alternative to classical supramolecular interactions such as hydrogen or halogen bonds. While its behavior in the electronic ground state has been extensively studied, its role in the excited state is gaining increasing attention. We recently demonstrated that the lack of photoswitchability of ortho&#8208;tellurated azobenzenes is due to an excitation&#8208;induced conversion of the classical chalcogen bond into a more pronounced, electron&#8208;rich three&#8208;electron &#963; bond. This transformation significantly strengthens the interaction between the chalcogen and the Lewis base center, effectively preventing isomerization. Based on these findings, we have now investigated the photoswitching behavior of ortho&#8208;tellurium&#8208;substituted azoarenes by modulation of the electronic properties of the aryl substituent and the oxidation state of the tellurium center. Our results show that electron&#8208;donating groups destabilize the excited&#8208;state geometry associated with the formation of a three&#8208;electron &#963; bond, thereby restoring photoisomerizability. Furthermore, oxidation to the Te(IV) species disrupts this bonding interaction, leading to significantly enhanced photoswitching properties. Together, these findings provide valuable design principles for the development of multiresponsive molecular switches based on chalcogen bonding and excited&#8208;state control.

         <title>Polarization and Dipole Moment Effects on Sigma&#8208;Hole Potential in Tin(IV)&#8208;Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through this work with experimental and computational studies we have systematically investigated the role of interplay of electronic effects such as polarization, dipole moment and resonance on the sigma&#8208;hole potential in macrocyclic system like, metalloporphyrin system. The behavior of the sigma&#8208;hole potential of equatorial iodine atom of metalloporphyrin has been studied upon changing substituted ligands at axial position in metalloporphyrin.








Abstract
This study investigates how electron&#8208;withdrawing substitution, molecular polarization, and dipole moment influence the &#963;&#8208;hole potential in six&#8208;coordinate metalloporphyrins. To evaluate halogen bonding tendencies, we synthesized a series of five Sn(IV)&#8208;5,10,15,20&#8208;meso&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;iodophenyl)porphyrin complexes with various fluorinated phenolate axial ligands. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed distinct halogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular motifs, which vary depending on the degree of fluorination at the axial ligands. Our findings highlight the critical role of ligand&#8208;induced polarization and dipole moment variations in modulating the &#963;&#8208;hole characteristics of the equatorial iodine atoms. Computational modelling showed that increased fluorine substitution reduces both the atomic dipole moments of fluorine and the polarizability of the central tin ion. However, despite these changes, the axial fluorination has a negligible effect on the &#963;&#8208;hole potential at the iodine atoms. This limited influence is attributed to the orthogonal orientation between the porphyrin core and the peripheral phenyl rings, which suppresses resonance interactions. Overall, this work emphasizes the importance of understanding electronic effects at the molecular level, particularly in the design and formation of halogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular architectures.

         <title>Base&#8208;Assisted Formation of Ferryl Species from TMC with Pendant N&#8208;Methylimidazole: Ligand and Base Effects on FeIV&#8208;Oxo Generation via O&#8208;O Bond Heterolysis</title>

[FeIV(O)(TMC&#8208;NMe&#8208;im)]2+ (2) was characterized by spectroscopy and crystallography. It forms via PhIO or H2O2 under weak to strong basic conditions. Replacing N&#8208;methylimidazole with pyridine doubles the FeIV&#8208;oxo formation rate. Eyring analysis of forming [FeIV(O)(TMC&#8208;NMe&#8208;im)]2+ (2) and [FeIV(O)(TMC&#8208;py)]2+ (4) suggests a heterolytic O&#8211;O bond cleavage mechanism.








Abstract
FeIV&#8208;oxo species can be generated using hydrogen peroxide via peroxidases, where the iron heme active site has a trans&#8208;imidazole. Here, we report the synthesis of FeII(TMC) complexes bearing pendant N&#8208;methylimidazole or pyridine donors using a modified reductive amination method. The structural characterization of complex 1 using ESI&#8208;Ms spectrometry, 1H&#8208;NMR spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed a distorted square&#8208;pyramidal geometry (&#964;&#160;=&#160;0.45). The Fe&#8211;Nimidazole bond to N&#8208;methylimidazole was significantly shorter (2.066(6)&#160;&#197;) than that to pyridine (2.112&#160;&#197;), indicating stronger electron donation from N&#8208;methylimidazole. For complex 2, the corresponding FeIV&#8208;oxo species was successfully generated using iodosylbenzene (PhIO)/hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and characterized by UV&#8211;vis, 1H&#8208;NMR, FTIR spectroscopy, ESI&#8208;Ms spectrometry, and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The second&#8208;order rate constants (k2) of 2 with CHD and PPh3. are 0.14(0) and 0.50(1)&#160;M&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, respectively. In addition, the Kinetic analysis demonstrated a 1000&#8208;fold increase in the FeIV&#8208;oxo formation rate (kobs&#160;= 1.1(1)&#215;10&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 for 2; 2.7(2)&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 for 4) when 2,6&#8208;lutidine was replaced with triethylamine in the presence of H2O2. Eyring analysis revealed a heterolytic O&#8211;O bond cleavage mechanism for H2O2 (&#916;H&#8225;&#160;= 19(1)&#160;kJ&#160;mol&#8722;1, &#916;S&#8225;&#160;= &#8722;197(4)&#160;J/mol&#160;K for 2; &#916;H&#8225;&#160;= 18(0)&#160;kJ/mol, &#916;S&#8225;&#160;= &#8722;188(2)&#160;J&#160;mol&#8722;1K&#8722;1 for 4).

         <title>Amorphous Nickel Hydroxide Shell Encloses the Nickel Sulfide for Electrochemical Water Oxidation at Low Overpotential</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NiSx/Ni(OH)2 catalyst with an amorphous/crystalline heterointerface was fabricated via precise phase modulation. The Ni(OH)2 shell coating significantly boosts catalytic activity, enhances long&#8208;term stability, and improves overall performance compared to pristine NiSx.








Abstract
Despite the remarkable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance demonstrated by transition metal sulfides, their practical application in overall water splitting remains constrained by insufficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, particularly under alkaline conditions. This limitation primarily arises from unstable active sites and sluggish reaction kinetics at high oxidation potentials. To address these challenges, we present a novel heterostructure engineering strategy through gradient phase control. The core innovation of this work lies in the construction of a unique amorphous/crystalline heterointerface through precise phase modulation. Our hierarchical architecture features phase&#8208;mixed nickel sulfides of NiS and Ni3S2 (use NiSx abbreviation) encapsulated by an amorphous Ni(OH)2 shell. In which the NiSx provides rapid electron transport channels, and the amorphous shell serves as both protective and activation functions through dynamically reconfigurable surface coordination. As expected, the synthesized NiSx/Ni(OH)2 catalyst achieved excellent performance, it achieves a current density of 100&#160;mA cm&#8315;2 at only 160&#160;mV overpotential, significantly outperforming its precursor materials, Ni(OH)&#8322; (446&#160;mV) and NiSx (212&#160;mV). More significantly, the catalyst demonstrates exceptional operational stability with&#160;&lt;&#160;2% activity decay during prolonged 200&#8208;h continuous electrolysis. This provides a new way to commercialize non&#8208;precious metal electrocatalysts instead of precious metal catalysts.

         <title>Mono&#8208; IrIII versus Heterobimetallic IrIII&#8208;AuI Complexes for Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two enantiopure heterobimetallic complexes, namely &#916;&#8208;IrAu&#8208;4 and &#923;&#8208;IrAu&#8208;4, have been synthesized. The photophysical and chiroptical properties were characterized and compared with the archetypal &#923;/&#916;&#8208;Ir(ppy)2(acac), highlighting an increase in gLum value moving from mono&#8208; to heterobimetallic Ir(III) complexes. This work provides valuable insights on the design of better and more efficient CPL&#8208;active complexes and materials for CP&#8208;optoelectronics.








Abstract
Fundamental rationalization of the structural&#8212;circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity relationship is a challenging task. Herein, a pair of enantiopure, heterobimetallic IrIII&#9472;AuI complexes IrAu&#8208;4 featuring chirality&#8208;at&#8208;metal is thoroughly investigated by means of spectroscopical and computational techniques, also including spin&#8208;orbital coupling (SOC) effects. Upon resolution of the racemic mixture of the starting chloro&#8208;bridged dimer via a chiral auxiliary ligand, the complexes IrIII&#9472;AuI are straightforwardly prepared in a stepwise procedure with retention of configuration in good yields. The IrAu&#8208;4 complexes display moderate orange phosphorescence arising from an admixed metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand and ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MLCT/3LLCT) excited state and good chiroptical activity, as shown by both electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and CPL spectroscopy. A comparison between the parental mononuclear pairs &#916;&#8208;Ir(ppy)2(acac) and &#923;&#8208;Ir(ppy)2(acac) and the binuclear IrAu&#8208;4 counterparts also provides interesting insights. The latter possess higher dissymmetry factor (gLum) values despite the very similar ECD activity of the lower&#8208;lying 1MLCT band with enantiospecific polarization bias of the light dictated by the chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal configuration. The different nature of the emissive excited state between the two families of complexes and its implication onto the radiative rate constant and the dipolar force is tentatively accounted for the increased CPL&#8208;activity observed in IrAu&#8208;4.

         <title>An Alumanyl Test Case of Group 1 Redox Interchange</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The arene&#8208;encapsulated M+ cations of the group 1 alumanyls, [{SiNDipp}AlM]2 ({SiNDipp} = {CH2SiMe2N(Dipp)}2; Dipp&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;i&#8208;Pr2C6H3); M&#160;=&#160;Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs] may be interconverted by redox reactions with the elemental alkali metals.

Rationalized by a thermochemical evaluation using both theoretical density functional theory (DFT) and empirical data, we show that the arene&#8208;encapsulated M+&#160;cations of the group 1 alumanyls, [{SiNDipp}AlM]2 ({SiNDipp} = {CH2SiMe2N(Dipp)}2; Dipp&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;i&#8208;Pr2C6H3); M&#160;=&#160;Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs] may be interconverted by redox reactions with the elemental alkali metals. These observations contradict the established E0 data and allow access to an otherwise inaccessible sodium derivative.

         <title>Spatially Coordinated Delivery of siRNA and Peptide Antagonist by Using Quantum Dots for Synergetic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum dots (QDs) facilitate ElP103&#8208;mediated siEZH2 delivery by forming RPQDs, which enhance cellular uptake and promote efficient lysosomal escape.








Abstract
We present in this work a quantum&#8208;dot (QDs)&#8208;based delivery strategy for siRNA which shows pronounced improvements of stability against enzymatic degradation by ribonucleases, cellular uptake due to positively charge, and release from endosomes. The introduction of RNA&#8208;binding peptide to the QDs surface enables the dual delivery of the siRNA&#8208;peptide assembly. Briefly, EZH2&#8208;targeting peptide (EIP103) was first introduced to QDs surface via biotin&#8208;streptavidin interaction (PQDs), followed by incubation of siRNA that silences EZH2 (siEZH2). The self&#8208;assembly of EIP103 and siEZH2 on the QDs surface (RPQDs) was achieved via electrostatic attraction between the cationic EIP103 and the negatively charged siEZH2. The results revealed that the obtained RPQDs not only protect both EIP103 peptides and siEZH2 from enzymatic hydrolysis but also promote their endocytosis and endosome escape. This study demonstrates the feasibility of dual delivery and targeting of peptides and siRNA, offering a novel strategy for the synergistic cancer therapy.

         <title>BN&#8208;Fused Polycyclic Heteroarenes Containing Thiopyran Moieties: Synthesis, Aromaticity, and Dual&#8208;Chromic Behavior</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
BN&#8208;fused thiopyran derivatives have been designed and successfully synthesized. Unlike the fluoride ions coordinating to the azaborine rings, the protons are introduced on the cyclopenta[b]thiopyran units. This work not only provides the first construction of BN&#8208;fused thiopyran derivatives but also develops new candidates for dual&#8208;chromic smart materials.








Abstract
BN&#8208;fused polycyclic heteroarenes have attracted extensive attention due to their distinctive structures and optoelectronic properties. However, the fusion of an azaborine ring on a six&#8208;membered thiopyran ring remains unexplored, limiting the chemical diversity and optical tunability of this unique material family. Herein, BN&#8208;embedded thiopyran derivatives with different conjugation lengths have been straightforwardly synthesized, and their photophysical properties, aromaticities, and dual&#8208;chromic behaviors have been systematically investigated. The successful incorporation of the thiopyran ring into BN&#8208;embedded heteroarenes endows the rigid molecules with a narrow optical band gap. Moreover, the BN&#8208;fused thiopyran derivatives exhibit dual&#8208;chromic behaviors in response to fluoride ions and protons. Unlike the fluoride ions coordinating to the azaborine rings, the protons are introduced on the cyclopenta[b]thiopyran moieties, as revealed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectra and theoretical calculations. Additionally, fluorination brings about the loss of aromaticity for the azaborine ring, while protonation induces the aromaticity enhancement for the thiopyran ring. Furthermore, dual&#8208;chromic pictures based on the BN&#8208;embedded thiopyran derivates are demonstrated. Overall, this work not only provides the first construction of BN&#8208;fused thiopyran derivatives but also develops new candidates for dual&#8208;chromic smart materials.

         <title>Polymerization Order in the Synthesis of 2D Block Supramolecular Copolymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, it is shown that, as in the case of block copolymerization in covalent polymer chemistry, the order of the polymerization of two monomers has a critical effect in the synthesis of 2D block copolymers of porphyrin&#8208;based monomers. In one of the orders of polymerization, secondary nucleation is involved, leading to nanosheets with uncontrolled areas and edge roughness.








Abstract
In the synthesis of block polymers through living polymerization, the order in which the monomers are copolymerized can have a critical effect on the polymerization efficacy. The same should hold true for the synthesis of block supramolecular polymers; however, this remains unexplored. The effect of the order of the polymerization of the monomers in 2D seeded/living supramolecular block copolymerization of porphyrin&#8208;based monomers is investigated. Unlike 1D living polymers, 2D supramolecular polymers (or nanosheets) have two distinct propagation sites. It is shown that inverting the order of polymerization can lead to distinct growth modes; importantly, secondary nucleation is involved in one of these cases. If secondary nucleation takes place at the edges of the seeds prior to 2D growth, the resulting nanosheets tend to exhibit uncontrolled areas and edge roughness.

         <title>A Convergent Radical Cascade for the Synthesis of Azaindanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convergent approach for synthesising diverse azaindanes through visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven radical cyclisation is explored. Using Katritzky salts and alkenes, this method tolerates various functional groups and does not require the addition of oxidants or photocatalysts. The exploration of a broad scope enable the definition of the requirements for a successful process. Additionally, the roles of the acid additive and the triphenylpyridine by&#8208;product are investigated.








Abstract
The azaindane motif is present in a number of drug candidates and combines the benefits of both a high sp3&#8208;fraction and an heteroaromatic ring. However, only a limited number of efficient approaches for the elaboration of this motif have been reported, and very few are flexible enough to enable the fast generation of analogues. Here we report the exploration of a convergent process for the construction of a variety of azaindanes and related semi&#8208;saturated fused heterocycles from an heteroaromatic triphenylpyridinium (Katritzky Salt) and an alkene coupling partner. In this process, two new C&#9472;C bonds are formed in a single step involving the activation of a pyridine&#8208;containing Katritzky salt under visible light irradiation in acidic conditions without the use of additional reductant/oxidant or photocatalyst. Under these operationally simple conditions, a variety of functional groups are tolerated, but the outcome of the reaction is dependent on the electronic nature of the pendant heterocycle and the alkene reaction partner. To help the exploration of future substrates, guidelines are established to predict the outcome of the reaction. Additionally, mechanistic studies shed light on the role played by the acid additive as well as the triphenylpyridine by&#8208;product in this process.

         <title>Expanding the Scope of BICAAC Organocatalyst: Hydroboration of Carbonyl and Alkyne Substrates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
BICAAC efficiently mediates the hydroborative reduction of carbonyls and alkynes. In situ control experiments, 1H NMR monitoring, and DFT calculations show BICAAC acts as a pre&#8208;catalyst, forming the active species in situ via oxidative addition of the B&#9472;H bond at the carbene center. This species lowers the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap between benzaldehyde and HBpin, enabling the reaction. These insights elucidate BICAAC's mechanistic role and highlight its potential in advancing metal&#8208;free catalytic systems.








Abstract
Bicyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (BICAAC) (I) has been used as a highly effective catalyst for hydroboration of aldehydes, ketones, and alkynes. The catalyst is effective across a broad range of substrates bearing both electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, indicating its robust functional group tolerance. Mechanistic investigations, supported by both experimental studies and computational analyses, suggest the initial step involves the reaction of BICAAC (I) with pinacolborane (HBpin), leading to the formation of boron&#8211;carbene complex (active catalyst II). This active species facilitates substrate activation. A subsequent hydride transfer from an additional equivalent of HBpin to the activated substrate completes the reduction process. This stepwise mechanism underscores the dual role of HBpin as both a catalyst activator and a hydride donor. The interaction between BICAAC and HBpin is pivotal, as it modulates the electronic environment of the boron center to promote efficient hydride delivery.

&lt;p&gt;BICAAC efficiently mediates the hydroborative reduction of carbonyls and alkynes. In situ control experiments, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR monitoring, and DFT calculations show BICAAC acts as a pre-catalyst, forming the active species in situ via oxidative addition of the B&#9472;H bond at the carbene center. This species lowers the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap between benzaldehyde and HBpin, enabling the reaction. These insights elucidate BICAAC's mechanistic role and highlight its potential in advancing metal-free catalytic systems.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bicyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (BICAAC) (&lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt;) has been used as a highly effective catalyst for hydroboration of aldehydes, ketones, and alkynes. The catalyst is effective across a broad range of substrates bearing both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups, indicating its robust functional group tolerance. Mechanistic investigations, supported by both experimental studies and computational analyses, suggest the initial step involves the reaction of BICAAC (&lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt;) with pinacolborane (HBpin), leading to the formation of boron&#8211;carbene complex (active catalyst &lt;b&gt;II&lt;/b&gt;).

This stepwise mechanism underscores the dual role of HBpin as both a catalyst activator and a hydride donor.

         <title>Platform Design Enabling Silver(III) Stabilization &#9472; The Uprise of AgIIICF3 Chemistry?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidation state&#160;+III represents the highest known for silver compounds. This Concept Article critically analyzes the main strategies allowing for the authentication of silver(III) compounds, with special focus on AgIIICF3 species, that were discovered back in the 80&#8242;s and 90&#8242;s, but brought back to the scene very recently. They often display an inverted ligand field (ILF) electronic structure, which impacts their reactivity (i.e., inhibited axial nucleophilicity), and enables the expansion of the coordination number (up to 6) of SP&#8208;4 AgIII compounds.








Abstract
Unlike its coinage metal counterparts, copper and gold, silver chemistry remains poorly developed and mostly restricted to the oxidation state&#160;+I, which embraces a large variety of coordination environments and types of ligand. Higher oxidation states, that is, +II and&#160;+III, are significantly less represented and predominantly adopt a square planar (SP&#8208;4) geometry around the metal center. In particular, well&#8208;defined d8 AgIII compounds are scarce, and include only a handful of examples exhibiting out&#8208;of&#8208;plane silver coordination. This Concept Article summarizes the strategies known to stabilize AgIII, as well as the unusual electronic structures (inverted ligand field) often found in these compounds. The intriguing case study of the expansion in the coordination number in AgIIICF3 compounds will be highlighted.

         <title>Enhancing Photocatalytic Performance of Imine&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) through Grafting Methoxyl Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The methoxy&#8208;groups&#8208;grafted TMTA&#8208;DTM&#8208;COF has been demonstrated to show a narrower bandgap and better photoelectric performance, which can be used as an efficient photocatalyst for the conversion of phenyl boronic acids into phenols.








Abstract
Preparing imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with good stability and excellent photocatalytic performance is highly desirable. Herein, methoxy groups were successfully grafted on the skeleton of highly stable TTA&#8208;DTM&#8208;COF through monomer modification strategy. The as&#8208;prepared TMTA&#8208;DTM&#8208;COF has a narrower bandgap and better photoelectric performance, which can be used as an efficient photocatalyst for the conversion of phenyl boronic acids into phenols. Our studies showed that the conversion efficiency of phenyl boronic acids into phenols using TMTA&#8208;DTM&#8208;COF as a catalyst was 1.3 times higher than that with TTA&#8208;DTM&#8208;COF as a catalyst. In addition, TMTA&#8208;DTM&#8208;COF exhibits excellent recyclability and maintains high stability during cyclic tests. Our research demonstrates that grafting methoxyl groups could be a good strategy to stabilize COFs as efficient metal&#8208;free and heterogeneous catalysts for organic conversion.

         <title>On the Reaction of Pacman&#8208;Phosphanes with Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of a Pacman phosphane (a macrocyclic, multidentate phosphane ligand) with Lewis acids such as BPh&#8323;, B(C&#8326;F&#8325;)&#8323;, and GaCl&#8323; were investigated, revealing distinct bonding motifs and coordination behaviors. While B(C&#8326;F&#8325;)&#8323; forms a stable di&#8208;adduct, GaCl&#8323; induces an unusual structural rearrangement with the formation of a [Pacman&#8208;GaCl&#8322;]&#8314;[GaCl&#8324;]&#8315; salt and a rare tetracoordinated phosphorus center in the&#160;+&#160;III oxidation state.








Abstract
The reactions of Pacman phosphanes (1a) with Lewis acids such as R3B (R&#160;=&#160;C6H5, C6F5) and GaCl3 were investigated. While equilibria between mono&#8208; and di&#8208;adducts were found in the reaction with BPh3, B(C6F5)3 preferentially formed the di&#8208;adduct (1a&#183;2B(C6F5)3), which could be isolated and fully characterized. density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that the N&#8208;bonded adducts are thermodynamically more stable than the P&#8208;bonded adducts. In contrast to the reaction of the Pacman phosphane with boranes, GaCl3 reacted with 1a to give an unusual [Pacman&#8208;GaCl2]+[GaCl4]&#8722; salt, featuring a nearly planar GaN2C2 heterocycle as part of the Pacman macrocycle. In addition, the coordination geometry on one P atom changes from triple to an unusual quadruple coordination, although it is still a formal P atom in the&#160;+&#160;III oxidation state, as shown by quantum chemical calculations.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Cycloaddition of CO2 with Epoxides Catalyzed by Recyclable Mg2&#8314;/TiO2 Photocatalyst Operating at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A recyclable Mg2&#8314;/TiO&#8322; photocatalyst enables the cycloaddition of CO&#8322; with epoxides under visible light at room temperature, providing a sustainable route to cyclic carbonates without the need for solvents or harsh conditions. The catalyst shows a broad substrate scope, excellent yields, and recyclability, including successful gram&#8208;scale synthesis. Furthermore, the system demonstrates real&#8208;world applicability through CO&#8322; capture from simulated exhaust gas. Mechanistic insights supported by DFT calculations revealed a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven radical pathway via bromide activation.








Abstract
The utilization of CO2 as a C1 building block remains a key challenge in sustainable organic synthesis. We now report a recyclable metal ion modified titanium oxide (Mn+/TiO2, where Mn+ represents Mg2+, Rh3+, Cr3+, Mn2+, Fe2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, and Al3+) photocatalytic system used with a tetrabutylammonium halide (TBAX, X&#160;=&#160;I, Br, Cl) as a co&#8208;catalyst, which enables the cycloaddition of CO2 with various epoxides under visible light irradiation at room temperature. This catalyst system exhibits a broad range of responsiveness to visible light and is compatible with simulated solar light, and operates solvent&#8208;free conditions without the need for high pressure. Excellent yields and selectivities were achieved by the Mg2+/TiO2 photocatalyst, and the method was successfully scaled to gram&#8208;scale synthesis without any loss of efficiency. Simulated post&#8208;combustion exhaust gas (CO2: 7.5%, N2: 92.5%, relative humidity: 90%) was concentrated to 97% and used for the reaction, yielding 88% styrene carbonate from styrene oxide by the catalysis of Mg2+/TiO2. Furthermore, the Mg2+/TiO2 catalyst could be readily recovered and reused over multiple cycles. Mechanistic investigations supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that the bromine radical (Br&#8226;), generated via photooxidation of bromide ion from TBABr, initiates the epoxide ring&#8208;opening.

Simulated post-combustion exhaust gas (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: 7.5%, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: 92.5%, relative humidity: 90%) was concentrated to 97% and used for the reaction, yielding 88% styrene carbonate from styrene oxide by the catalysis of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Furthermore, the Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst could be readily recovered and reused over multiple cycles. Mechanistic investigations supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that the bromine radical (Br&#8226;), generated via photooxidation of bromide ion from TBABr, initiates the epoxide ring-opening.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Acceptor&#8208;Adaptive Automated Glycosylation Optimization for Automated Glycan Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The difficulty of finding the optimal glycosylation conditions for automated solid&#8208;phase glycan assembly leads to the use of large temperature ranges and excess reagents. This has negative atom and energy efficiency implications. We demonstrate that mirroring glycosylation temperature from solution to solid phase via an automated acceptor&#8208;adaptive optimization strategy empowers an efficient and sustainable automated glycan assembly (AGA) process.








Abstract
Optimization of glycosylation temperatures is essential for automated solid&#8208;phase glycan assembly. Constructing a reliable optimization system that mimics key reaction components is crucial for increasing the atom economy and the energy efficiency of the process. Although glycosyl acceptors play a pivotal role in glycosylation, evaluating their effect on glycosylation efficiency (GE) is nontrivial. While screening various glycosyl acceptors for optimization is impractical, compromising for simple alkyl acceptors produces results of dubious relevance. We demonstrate that optimization with a modified trans&#8208;4&#8208;aminocyclohexanol&#8208;based acceptor accurately reflects the optimal glycosylation temperature of several glycosyl acceptors, overcoming previous limitations. The contextual use of both n&#8208;alkyl and glycan&#8208;mimetic acceptors for automated optimization enabled translation of optimized glycosylation temperature to highly efficient solid&#8208;phase synthesis (SPS) of disaccharides.

         <title>Practical Electrochemical Hydroxynitration and Chloronitration Bifunctionalization of Alkenes with NaNO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work developed an electrochemical hydroxynitration or chloronitration bifunctionalization reaction of unsaturated carbon&#8208;carbon double bond by using sodium nitrite as a nitro source, and a series of vicinal hydroxynitro or chloronitro compounds was produced in good to excellent yields.








Abstract
We herein developed a novel method for generating nitryl free radicals using sodium nitrite for the first time under electrocatalytic conditions. A series of vicinal hydroxynitro or chloronitro compounds was generated in good yields. This methodology features a simple reaction setup, mild reaction conditions, and cheap electrodes and shows excellent functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope, enabling efficient gram&#8208;scale reactions with good to excellent yields. Besides, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) results provided deeper insights into the reaction mechanism. Further extensions of the method have also confirmed the practicality of the strategy developed.

Modular self&#8208;assembly of extendable porphyrin&#8208;based heterotrimetallic discrete architectures: a new efficient strategy toward the construction of stable multicomponent functional systems.








Abstract
An efficient strategy for the preparation of heterometallic discrete porphyrin assemblies, tuned both in dimensions and number of metal centers, is described. Five rod&#8208;shaped di&#8208;pyridyl FeII&#8208;metalloligands, with varied length (1.5 &#8211; 3.2&#160;nm), lateral substituents, and number of iron centers, were used to bridge two RuII&#8208;metallacycles, made of two coplanar ZnII&#8208;porphyrin each. The resulting architectures consist of four RuII complexes, four zinc&#8208;porphyrins, and either two or four FeII&#8208;clathrochelate units. Earlier, geometrically similar sandwich&#8208;like architectures were based on purely organic connectors. Among other novel characteristics, the use of metalloligands was found to be beneficial for the overall stability, thus allowing for a solution&#8208;based characterization of the assemblies. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structures were determined for the complete collection, highlighting additional key features: the two facing ZnII&#8208;porphyrin platforms are set wide apart according to the span of the two connecting metalloligands, while the latter are parallelly aligned by the anchoring ZnII&#8208;porphyrin/RuII&#8208;metallacycles, at fixed inter Fe&#183;&#183;Fe distance(s). Mutual control over these geometrical parameters is very strict, as evidenced by self&#8208;sorting experiments. Useful implementation of these systems into functional systems may be envisaged by pairing the peripheral metalloporphyrin photosensitizers with photo/redox/catalytically active inner metal cores.

         <title>Efficient Photocatalytic Degradation of Methylene Blue From Aqueous Solution Using Hybrid Biomass&#8208;Derived Nanostructured Carbon&#8208;TiO2 Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid photocatalyst of biomass&#8208;derived carbon nanospheres and TiO&#8322; has been developed from waste coffee leaves, achieving 99% MB dye degradation. The carbon reduces the bandgap, boosting UV photocatalysis, and the material shows excellent stability and recyclability, offering a sustainable, scalable solution for wastewater treatment.








Abstract
Industrial dye usage results in substantial wastewater discharge, posing environmental and health hazards. Hence, developing efficient, sustainable, and cost&#8208;effective treatment technologies is crucial. Photocatalysis using TiO&#8322; has emerged as a promising approach for dye degradation. This study explores the photocatalytic removal of methylene blue (MB), a model dye pollutant, using a composite of biomass&#8208;derived carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) and nanosized TiO&#8322; under UV light. The CNPs were synthesized via one&#8208;step pyrolysis from waste coffee leaves, offering a sustainable carbon source. The resulting CNPs (CL&#8208;10) and the TiO&#8322;&#8208;CNP composite (PC@CL&#8208;10) were thoroughly characterized using advanced techniques. Incorporating carbon significantly reduces the band gap of TiO&#8322; from &#8764;3.2&#160;eV to 2.90&#160;eV, enhancing photocatalytic activity. Degradation studies under varying catalyst doses, dye concentrations, and pH levels demonstrate effective MB removal under UV irradiation. Photocatalytic experiments revealed up to 99% degradation of MB under UV light, while tests conducted in the dark showed negligible activity, confirming the light&#8208;dependent efficiency. Kinetic analysis indicated that intra&#8208;particle diffusion (IPD) governs the dye degradation process. Moreover, recyclability tests over seven cycles showed consistent performance with minimal decline, highlighting the catalyst's stability and reusability. These findings suggest that PC@CL&#8208;10 is a highly effective, low&#8208;cost photocatalyst with strong potential for large&#8208;scale wastewater treatment applications.

         <title>Zirconium&#8208;Mediated Hydroaminoalkylation of Conjugated Dienes Probed by a Computational Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8208;depth computational mechanistic probe of the zirconium&#8208;mediated hydroaminoalkylation of conjugated dienes with N&#8208;aryl substituted amines complements previous stochiometric and catalytic studies, providing a deeper understanding of intricate mechanistic details.








Abstract
An in&#8208;depth computational probe of the hydroaminoalkylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes with N&#8208;aryl substituted amines by a tethered bis(ureate)&#8208;ligated zirconium compound is reported. The mechanistic proposal derived from smooth energy profiles acquired by employing a reliable computational protocol complies with previous experimental mechanistic studies, providing a more advanced understanding of intricate mechanistic aspects. The high degree of regioselectivity achieved for reversible diene insertion and butenyl tether protonolysis is instrumental for the generation of the main product, (E)&#8208;4,1 linear homoallylic amine. Product liberation and regeneration of the zirconaaziridine favours a two&#8208;step sequence comprising transamination with incoming amine, followed by &#946;&#8208;hydrogen abstraction at the intervening zircona bis&#8208;amide. The irreversible transamination is likely the regioselectivity&#8208;determining event that dictates the product composition. The &#946;&#8208;hydrogen abstraction at the zircona bis&#8208;amide, which likely constitutes the catalyst resting state, is turnover limiting. Its DFT&#8208;assessed defining barrier conforms with reported catalyst performance data. The role of the smaller, more nucleophilic dimethylamide in the catalytic transformation has been revealed.

&lt;p&gt;An in-depth computational probe of the hydroaminoalkylation of 1,3-dienes with &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-aryl substituted amines by a tethered bis(ureate)-ligated zirconium compound is reported. The mechanistic proposal derived from smooth energy profiles acquired by employing a reliable computational protocol complies with previous experimental mechanistic studies, providing a more advanced understanding of intricate mechanistic aspects. The high degree of regioselectivity achieved for reversible diene insertion and butenyl tether protonolysis is instrumental for the generation of the main product, (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-4,1 linear homoallylic amine. Product liberation and regeneration of the zirconaaziridine favours a two-step sequence comprising transamination with incoming amine, followed by &#946;-hydrogen abstraction at the intervening zircona bis-amide. The irreversible transamination is likely the regioselectivity-determining event that dictates the product composition. The &#946;-hydrogen abstraction at the zircona bis-amide, which likely constitutes the catalyst resting state, is turnover limiting. Its DFT-assessed defining barrier conforms with reported catalyst performance data. The role of the smaller, more nucleophilic dimethylamide in the catalytic transformation has been revealed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Productive Homogeneous Hydrogenation of Fatty Esters with Carboxylate SNS Ruthenium Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carboxylate ruthenium complexes, prepared from easily accessible ruthenium precursors and bis(2&#8208;(ethylthio)ethyl)amine (SNS ligand), efficiently catalyze the hydrogenation (HY) of methyl decanoate (model for the FAME reduction) to 1&#8208;decanol with H2 under mild conditions and without solvents. The acetate trans&#8208;[Ru(&#951;1&#8208;OAc)2(SNS)(PPh3)] derivative catalyzes the HY of a number of long&#8208;chain and aromatic methyl&#8208; and ethyl esters at extremely high S/C (up to 100,&#160;000).








Abstract
The carboxylate pincer complexes trans&#8208;[Ru(&#951;1&#8208;OCOR)2(SNS)(PPh3)] (R&#160;=&#160;CH3 1, tBu 2; SNS&#160;=&#160;bis(2&#8208;(ethylthio)ethylamine) are obtained from [Ru(&#951;2&#8208;OCOR)2(PPh3)2] (R&#160;=&#160;CH3, tBu) and HN(CH2CH2SEt)2 in acetone by elimination of PPh3. Substitution of PPh3 in 1 with PPh2Me gives trans&#8208;[Ru(&#951;1&#8208;OAc)2(SNS)(PPh2Me)] (3) in toluene at 105&#176;C. The cationic complexes cis&#8208;[Ru(&#951;1&#8208;OAc)(SNS)(dppb)]OAc (4) and [Ru(&#951;1&#8208;OAc)(CO)(SNS)(PPh3)]OAc (5) are synthesized from [Ru(&#951;2&#8208;OAc)2(dppb)] and [Ru(&#951;2&#8208;OAc)2(CO)(PPh3)2], respectively, by treatment with the SNS ligand in toluene. Hydride trans&#8208;[RuH(&#951;1&#8208;OAc)(SNS)(PPh3)] (6) is obtained by reaction of 1 with NaOiPr in a mixture of iPrOH/toluene. The carboxylate complexes 1&#8211;6 catalyze the homogeneous hydrogenation of methyl decanoate to 1&#8208;decanol with NaOMe under mild reaction conditions (T&#160;=&#160;40&#176;C, H2 pressure 27.5&#160;bar) and extremely low catalyst loading (S/C 10,000&#8211;100,000). Complexes 1 and 2 display remarkably high catalytic activity for the reduction of fatty acid methyl and ethyl esters at S/C of 50,000&#8211;100,000, with high selectivity for the reduction of the carboxylate group in the presence of C&#160;&#9552;&#160;C functionalities. An easy scale&#8208;up of this process (100&#160;mmol of substrate) has been demonstrated. Mechanistic studies show that 1 reacts with H2 (5&#160;bar), affording the monohydride 6, that by further reaction with H2 and an alkoxide gives the dihydride cis&#8208;[RuH2(SNS)(PPh3)], which reduces methyl benzoate to benzyl alcohol.

         <title>Hybrid Tuning in NHC Ligands: Synergistic Effects of BIAN &#960;&#8208;Conjugation and Aryl &#963;&#8208;Modulation in Gold(I) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present study investigates how combining &#960;&#8208;extended backbones with aryl substituent variation in Au(I)/BIAN&#8211;NHCX complexes affects their structure, photophysics, reactivity, and toxicity. It is evident that subtle changes in substituent type and position give rise to distinct trends, thus demonstrating how it is possible to harness &#960;&#8211;&#963; interactions in order to fine&#8208;tune properties for catalytic and biomedical applications.








Abstract
In this study, we explore extended design of metal&#8211;NHC complexes that relies on dual strategies for tuning ligand properties: (i) electronic modulation through &#960;&#8208;extended frameworks such as bis(imino)acenaphthene (BIAN), and (ii) systematic aryl substitution to influence &#963;&#8208;donor strength and steric environment. We report the first integrated exploration of these two strategies on a unified ligand platform. A series of Au(I)/BIAN&#8211;NHCX complexes were synthesized by introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents (X&#160;=&#160;F, Cl, Br, CF&#8323;) at the ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208;, and para&#8208;positions of the N&#8208;aryl groups. This hybrid tuning approach allowed us to probe the synergistic and antagonistic effects arising from &#960;&#8211;&#963; interplay across multiple dimensions. Each complex was thoroughly characterized with respect to synthetic yield, structural features (including X&#8208;ray structure and dynamics in solution), photophysical properties (UV&#8208;Vis and luminescence), catalytic performance in hydroamination of phenylacetylene, and cytotoxicity in HEK293T cells. Structure&#8211;property correlations revealed distinct cooperative and counteractive regimes depending on the substituent type and position. These findings demonstrate that combining orthogonal electronic control elements enables a more predictive and fine&#8208;grained design of NHC&#8208;based metal complexes, with future implications for catalysis, materials science, and biomedical applications.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Crystal Actuation of Fluorinated Acylhydrazones Enabled by [2+2] Photocycloaddition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Three isomeric fluorinated acylhydrazone derivatives (DFBP&#8208;IND, DFBP&#8208;BHD, DFBP&#8208;3&#8208;FBHD) were successfully synthesized and demonstrated dynamic photo&#8208;responsive behavior ranging from crack initiation to crystal fragmentation under 365 nm UV irradiation. The photochemical mechanism was explored in detail and highlighted the essential role of the C&#9552;N bond in the acylhydrazone framework for enabling [2+2] cycloaddition&#8208;driven actuation. Our structural engineering strategy established a design paradigm for photoresponsive materials through rational selection of hydrazide precursors, enabling precise modulation of optomechanical properties.








Abstract
Crystalline materials with photomechanical responsiveness have garnered significant attention in flexible actuators and micro/nano&#8208;electromechanical systems due to their unique capability to directly convert light into mechanical energy. In this work, four novel fluorinated acylhydrazone compounds were successfully synthesized through direct condensation reactions between 4,4&#8242;&#8208;difluorobenzophenone (DFBP) and acylhydrazine compounds, including benzoylhydrazine (BHD), 3&#8208;fluorobenzoylhydrazine (3&#8208;FBHD), isoniazid (IND), and acetylhydrazine (AED). Systematic investigation of their photomechanical responses revealed distinct molecular mechanisms. Experimental results demonstrate that isomeric fluorinated acylhydrazone derivatives (DFBP&#8208;BHD, DFBP&#8208;3&#8208;FBHD, DFBP&#8208;IND) exhibit dynamic photo&#8208;responsive behavior ranging from crack initiation to crystal fragmentation under 365&#160;nm UV irradiation, whereas the hydrazone derivative DFBP&#8208;AED remains inert. This confirms the essential role of [2&#160;+&#160;2] photocycloaddition&#8208;dependent C&#160;=&#160;N double bonds in photomechanical activity. Comprehensive characterization through DSC, TG, XRD, &#185;H/&#185;3C NMR, and MS elucidated the formation pathways and structural characteristics of photocycloaddition products. Density functional theory calculations revealed that energy disparities between (0 0 1) and (1 0 0) crystallographic planes govern longitudinal fragmentation patterns. This study establishes a &#8220;molecular structure&#8208;crystal arrangement&#8208;macroscopic response&#8221; multi&#8208;scale regulation strategy, offering novel insights for developing high&#8208;performance light&#8208;driven materials.

         <title>Preparation of Hierarchically Porous Monolithic Corn Straw@COF Composite for Fat&#8208;Rich Food Pretreatment in Non&#8208;Targeted Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous monolithic composite CS@COF was synthesized by the in situ growth of covalent organic framework (COF) on the CS surface. It achieved 98% removal of triglycerides and high recovery of 190 chemical hazards from fat&#8208;rich food, providing an efficient and cost&#8208;effective solution for sample pretreatment in food non&#8208;targeted analysis.









Abstract
In the food safety non&#8208;targeted analysis, it is urgent to develop suitable adsorbent materials for sample pretreatment, so as to achieve efficient removal of interference matrices in food samples and &#8220;full recovery&#8221; of potential chemical hazards. Traditional adsorption materials exhibit limitations such as poor removal efficiency and high cost. To address these issues, this study presents the preparation of a hierarchically porous monolithic corn straw@COF (CS@COF) composite for efficient sample pretreatment of fat&#8208;rich foods. CS@COF combines the advantages of corn straw (CS) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs), offering a high specific surface area and porosity. CS serves as a carrier for in&#8208;situ growth of COF, resulting in a material with easy operation and low cost. CS@COF demonstrates strong adsorption capacity, effectively removing over 98% of triglycerides within 8 minutes from fat&#8208;rich food samples like soybean. Moreover, it achieves &#8220;full recovery&#8221; of 190 chemical hazards with 89% recoveries within the ideal range. The reusability of CS@COF for 5 cycles after elution further underscores its practicality. This innovative CS@COF composite shows great potential in sample pretreatment for non&#8208;targeted food safety analysis, providing a cost&#8208;effective and efficient solution.

         <title>The Nature and Stability of Transition Metal&#8208;Anchored Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Graphene Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our quantum chemical analyses of the bonding trends between period 4 transition metals and nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene support reveal that the metal&#8211;support interaction strengthens from Ti to Ni, then weakens from Ni to Zn. This trend arises from changes in bonding interaction between the transition metals&#8217; 3dxy orbital and nitrogen lone pairs of the graphene support.








Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;anchored nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) represent an emerging class of catalysts that combine the advantages of both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. To prevent demetallation and ensure catalyst stability, sufficiently strong bonds between the transition metal and the support are essential. We have quantum chemically analyzed the trend in bonding interaction between period 4 transition metals (TM&#160;=&#160;Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) and the four&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene support. We find that the metal&#8211;support interactions strengthen from Ti to Ni but weaken from Ni to Zn. Activation strain and Kohn&#8208;Sham molecular orbital (KS&#8208;MO) analyses reveal that this trend stems from changes in the interaction between the metal's 3dxy atomic orbital and the nitrogen lone pair orbitals of the support. As we move along period 4, the bonding mechanism changes from an increasingly more stabilizing HOMO&#8211;LUMO interaction (TM&#160;=&#160;Ti&#8208;Ni), due to the higher effective nuclear charge of the metal, to a less favorable HOMO&#8211;SOMO (TM&#160;=&#160;Cu) and unfavorable HOMO&#8211;HOMO (TM&#160;=&#160;Zn) interaction, as a result of the filling of the metal's 3dxy atomic orbital. This results in the observed strengthening, followed by weakening, of the metal&#8211;support interaction. These insights could guide the rational design of future single&#8208;atom catalysts.

         <title>Dynamics of Ligand and Guest in 1D Hg(II)&#8208;Bispidine Coordination Polymers With Different Topologies Investigated by Solid&#8208;State NMR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1D CPs are promising materials for the adsorption of VOCs. Solid&#8208;state NMR was applied to characterize host&#8208;guest interactions and dynamics of chlorobenzene in two CPs with different topologies. While ligand dynamics were similar in both CPs, chlorobenzene was found to undergo more restricted dynamics in the CP with polycatenated topology because of the smaller free volume and stronger interactions.








Abstract
1D coordination polymers (CPs) made of parallel, weakly interacting chains have been recently proposed for the selective adsorption of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), one of the main sources of air and water pollution. Since the efficiency of adsorption for VOC removal strongly depends on the specific and stable interactions between the volatile species and the CP framework, the characterization at the atomic level of host&#8208;guest interactions and guest dynamics is of particular interest. Here, low&#8208; and high&#8208;resolution solid&#8208;state NMR experiments were applied to acquire information on ligand and guest dynamics for two 1D CPs (1&#8208;ClBz and 2&#8208;ClBz), both containing a bispidine organic ligand, Hg(II) as a metal center, and chlorobenzene trapped within the framework, but featuring different topologies. By combining analyses of on&#8208;resonance 1H free induction decays (FIDs), 1H and 13C longitudinal relaxation times, and 2H quadrupole echo spectra, it was found that chlorobenzene undergoes fast dynamics, mainly isotropic, in 1&#8208;ClBz, while it shows slower anisotropic motions in 2&#8208;ClBz, indicating stronger interactions between framework and adsorbate in the latter associated with the lower available free volume. Ligands are quite rigid for both CPs in the investigated frequency scale, apart from methyl groups, which undergo fast motions about their ternary symmetry axes.

         <title>Cathepsin L&#8208;Activatable Fluorescent Probe for Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Drug&#8208;Resistant Breast Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
There is an urgent need for non&#8208;invasive tools capable of real&#8208;time, in situ tracking of drug&#8208;resistant cell populations. Cathepsin L (CTSL), a cysteine protease overexpressed in aggressive malignancies, presents such an opportunity. This work designs a CTSL&#8208;activatable fluorescent probe by synergizes a CTSL&#8208;specific dipeptide substrate (FR) with a fluorophore (DCO), tailored for imaging drug&#8208;resistant breast cancer cells. FR&#8208;DCO can achieve fluorescence enhancement upon CTSL activation, distinguishes MCF&#8208;7/ADR from non&#8208;resistant cells and visualizes resistant tumors in vivo with 2&#8208;fold higher signal intensity than controls.








Abstract
Precise identification of drug&#8208;resistant tumor cells remains a critical challenge for optimizing therapeutic strategies and improving clinical outcomes. Herein, we present FR&#8208;DCO, a cathepsin L (CTSL)&#8208;activatable fluorescent probe, engineered for targeted imaging of doxorubicin&#8208;resistant breast cancer cells (MCF&#8208;7/ADR). Capitalizing on the overexpression of CTSL in chemoresistant malignancies, FR&#8208;DCO integrates a CTSL&#8208;specific dipeptide substrate (Phe&#8208;Arg, FR) with a dicyanoisophorone (DCO) fluorophore, enabling fluorescence activation via a single&#8208;step enzymatic cleavage. Upon hydrolysis, FR&#8208;DCO transitions from an intramolecular charge transfer&#8208;quenched state to an activated DCO fluorophore, achieving a 12.8&#8208;fold enhancement in quantum yield. In vitro studies demonstrated both caveolin&#8208; and clathrin&#8208;mediated endocytosis in MCF&#8208;7/ADR cells, yielding 2.3&#8208;fold higher fluorescence intensity than its nonresistant counterparts (MCF&#8208;7 and 4T1). In vivo imaging in murine models revealed rapid and specific activation within drug&#8208;resistant tumors, with intratumoral fluorescence intensity doubling that of nonresistant lesions within 20&#160;minutes post&#8208;injection.

     alt="Cathepsin L-Activatable Fluorescent Probe for Real-Time Monitoring of Drug-Resistant Breast Cancer Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an urgent need for non-invasive tools capable of real-time, in situ tracking of drug-resistant cell populations. Cathepsin L (CTSL), a cysteine protease overexpressed in aggressive malignancies, presents such an opportunity. This work designs a CTSL-activatable fluorescent probe by synergizes a CTSL-specific dipeptide substrate (FR) with a fluorophore (DCO), tailored for imaging drug-resistant breast cancer cells. FR-DCO can achieve fluorescence enhancement upon CTSL activation, distinguishes MCF-7/ADR from non-resistant cells and visualizes resistant tumors in vivo with 2-fold higher signal intensity than controls.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precise identification of drug-resistant tumor cells remains a critical challenge for optimizing therapeutic strategies and improving clinical outcomes. Herein, we present FR-DCO, a cathepsin L (CTSL)-activatable fluorescent probe, engineered for targeted imaging of doxorubicin-resistant breast cancer cells (MCF-7/ADR). Capitalizing on the overexpression of CTSL in chemoresistant malignancies, FR-DCO integrates a CTSL-specific dipeptide substrate (Phe-Arg, FR) with a dicyanoisophorone (DCO) fluorophore, enabling fluorescence activation via a single-step enzymatic cleavage. Upon hydrolysis, FR-DCO transitions from an intramolecular charge transfer-quenched state to an activated DCO fluorophore, achieving a 12.8-fold enhancement in quantum yield. In vitro studies demonstrated both caveolin- and clathrin-mediated endocytosis in MCF-7/ADR cells, yielding 2.3-fold higher fluorescence intensity than its nonresistant counterparts (MCF-7 and 4T1). In vivo imaging in murine models revealed rapid and specific activation within drug-resistant tumors, with intratumoral fluorescence intensity doubling that of nonresistant lesions within 20&#160;minutes post-injection. Notably, dual-tumor xenograft models confirmed precise discrimination of MCF-7/ADR tumors from 4T1 tumors, highlighting the spatial resolution of the probe. This work not only provides a molecular tool for spatiotemporal resistance monitoring, but also establishes a modular design paradigm for enzyme-responsive probes targeting tumor microenvironment biomarkers, advancing precision oncology strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Functionalized in Triplicate: A Ring&#8208;By&#8208;Ring Approach to Tailored Prodiginine Derivatives for Site&#8208;Specific Conjugation Through Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prodigiosin is a potent cytotoxic alkaloid but lacks target selectivity. We advance functionalization of all three pyrrole rings of prodigiosin to enable site&#8208;specific conjugation via click chemistry. The presented azide&#8208; and maleimide&#8208;functionalized prodiginines are suitable for generating covalent prodiginine conjugates and attaching auspicious vectors for targeted drug delivery. The developed methodology promotes the expansion of conjugable pyrrole&#8208;based building blocks and natural products in the future.








Abstract
The tripyrrole prototype alkaloid prodigiosin and members of the prodigiosin family are structurally diverse bacterial secondary metabolites. The privileged scaffold accounts for versatile biological activities, for example, antimicrobial, antitumoral, and immunosuppressive. Its Lewis&#8208;basic lipophilic tripyrrole core and the aliphatic side chains allow for passive membrane diffusion, thereby trespassing the natural permeability barrier. However, diffusion&#8208;controlled uptake is accompanied by low target specificity, hampering the development of tailored prodigiosin therapeutics and their selective delivery to target sites. To address this downside, this work focuses on providing the chemical methodology to synthesize prodiginines that are amenable to click chemistry on each of the three pyrrole moieties and facilitate the development of prodigiosin conjugates. Installing reactive azides and maleimides in the A&#8208;, B&#8208;, and C&#8208;ring of the cytotoxic scaffold enables further functionalization per azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC and SPAAC) and thiol&#8208;maleimide addition, giving rise to protein&#8208;conjugable prodiginines for the first time. The presented synthetic routes comprise yields of 3.24.7% over 1215 steps and grant access to valuable synthetic elements for expanding the toolbox of click chemistry to other pyrrole&#8208;, pyrrolidinone&#8208;, and tetramic acid&#8208;containing natural products. Together, the devised methodology for prodiginine derivatization will collectively advance the development of alkaloid&#8208;based conjugate therapeutics, eligible for target&#8208;selective delivery.

         <title>In Quest for Polyenic Macrolactam JBIR&#8208;150 Identity: Stereoselective Synthesis of DP4+&#8208;Based Purported Structure and Biogenetically Inspired Positional Stereoisomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Total synthesis of polyenic macrolactam JBIR&#8208;150 with all&#8208;trans geometries, hydroxyl substituents located at C8 and C10 and 8R,10R,19R absolute configuration, the most likely stereoisomer predicted by DP4+ calculations, was completed. The formal syn&#8208;1,3&#8208;diol was synthesized iteratively by enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective Krische&#8217;s allylation reactions. The construction of the conjugated triene units was based on a Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling of the corresponding alkenylboronates and alkenyliodides, and Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons (HWE) condensation reactions. Macrolactam formation promoted by HATU and DIPEA was best carried out by amine protecting group exchange and release of both reactive functional groups under basic conditions. Given the lack of correspondence of the 1H&#8208; and 13C&#8208;NMR data for the synthetic and purported JBIR&#8208;150, the hydroxyl groups of JBIR&#8208;150 were alternatively proposed to be located at the odd&#8208;numbered positions (C9, C11) based on the general biogenesis of the family of polyenic macrolactams and the collinearity principle of their modular sequence. The C11&#8208;diastereoisomers of the biogenetically inspired 9,11&#8208;dihydroxy positional isomers (termed iso&#8208;JBIR&#8208;150) with formal syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;diol configurations was completed. Much to our dismay, the NMR data of the synthetic diastereomeric polyenic macrolactams with 9S,11S,19R or 9S,11R,19R absolute configuration did not match those of the natural product and the structural identity of JBIR&#8208;150 remains undetermined.</dc:description>

         <title>Fine&#8208;tuning of Physicochemical Properties of 3,3&#8208;Disubstituted Oxetanes Introducing Fluorine Atom(s) on the Building Blocks Level</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorinated oxetane derivatives garner significant attention due to their unique physicochemical properties and diverse bioisosteric possibilities for potential applications in medicinal chemistry. We developed robust methodologies for the synthesis of 3&#8208;fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted oxetanes, leveraging nucleophilic substitution, deoxy&#8208; and deoxofluorination, as well as fluoroiodination as key steps of introduction of fluorine atoms directly to the oxetane core or adjacent alkyl groups. Optimized reaction sequences enabled the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of various small building blocks, i.e. amines, carboxylic acids, alcohols, etc. Physicochemical studies revealed that fluorination significantly impacts acidity, with oxetane derivatives demonstrating the decrease of pKa values on up to three units in the case of replacement of gem&#8208;dimethyl, cyclopropyl&#8208; or cyclobutylidene moieties. These findings underscore the utility of fluorinated oxetanes as versatile building blocks for future applications in drug design and advanced materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phenazines, otherwise known as dibenzo annulated pyrazines, are a unique class of tricyclic organic molecules. They are chemically stable and highly aromatic due to their extended conjugation. Along with their biomedicinal significance, phenazines often play a major role in manipulating the optical as well as electrical properties of organic semiconductors. The planar structure in the heterocyclic aromatic phenazines and their natural inclination to form stacked columns due to the &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions between two consecutive molecules has made them quite a suitable moiety for the formation as well as extension of the core part of discotic liquid crystals. Their charge&#8208;carrying ability in electrolytes makes them well&#8208;suited for organic electronic materials. Furthermore, their properties can be fine&#8208;tuned with simple chemical changes rendering them appropriate for many advanced applications. This review focuses on the chemistry of phenazine&#8208;based discotic liquid crystals and their significance in optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent&#160;N6&#160;Versus&#160;Cvinyl&#160;Arylation of 8&#8208;Vinyl Adenine Nucleosides, Sequential Diarylation, Fluorescence Properties, and Computational Evaluations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Palladium&#8208;catalyzed aryl amination and Heck arylation reactions are complementary tranformations, generally requiring a suitable catalyst combination and a base. With substrates containing both an amino group and a vinyl moiety, control of C&#8211;N versus C&#8211;C reactivity can lead to regiodivergent functionalizations. With this focus, reactions of silyl&#8208;protected 8&#8208;vinyl adenosine and 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyadenosine with aryl bromides and iodides have been studied. Pd(OAc)2, Pd2(dba)3, and preformed dichloro[1,1&#8217;&#8208;bis(di&#8208;t&#8208;butylphosphino)ferrocene]palladium (II) (Pd&#8208;118) were evaluated as metal sources. Ligands tested were Xantphos, DPEphos, BIPHEP, and DPPF, with Cs2CO3 and K3PO4 as bases. In toluene as solvent, the Pd(OAc)2/Xantphos/Cs2CO3 combination was uniquely capable of predominant N6 arylation. Aryl bromides and iodides gave comparable product yields. Replacement of Cs2CO3 with K3PO4 redirected arylation from nitrogen atom to the vinyl carbon atom, and all other catalyst, ligand, and base combinations gave Cvinyl arylation as well. Simply switching from Pd(OAc)2 to Pd2(dba)3 resulted in loss of the N6&#8208;selectivity and Cvinyl arylation was favored. Based upon these results, using two structurally similar catalytic systems sequential Cvinyl and N6 arylations of the nucleosides were accomplished. Some of the products were converted to other novel nucleoside analogues. Because some compounds were fluorescent, their photophysical properties were assessed experimentally and computationally.</dc:description>

In toluene as solvent, the Pd(OAc)2/Xantphos/Cs2CO3 combination was uniquely capable of predominant N6 arylation. Aryl bromides and iodides gave comparable product yields. Replacement of Cs2CO3 with K3PO4 redirected arylation from nitrogen atom to the vinyl carbon atom, and all other catalyst, ligand, and base combinations gave Cvinyl arylation as well. Simply switching from Pd(OAc)2 to Pd2(dba)3 resulted in loss of the N6-selectivity and Cvinyl arylation was favored. Based upon these results, using two structurally similar catalytic systems sequential Cvinyl and N6 arylations of the nucleosides were accomplished. Some of the products were converted to other novel nucleoside analogues. Because some compounds were fluorescent, their photophysical properties were assessed experimentally and computationally.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>5d Orbital Covalency Controls the High&#8208;Pressure Polymorphism of BaO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The influence of metal d orbitals on the high&#8208;pressure structures of CaO, SrO, and BaO are investigated with DFT calculations and chemical bonding analysis. CaO and SrO undergo the B1&#8208;B2 transition, from the rock salt structure to the caesium chloride structure, while BaO undergoes a sequence of transitions from B1&#8208;B8, the NiAs structure, and then B8&#8722; dB2, a distorted form of B2. DFT calculations of bond strengths show that the B8 and dB2 structures are stabilized relative to B1 and B2 by metal&#8208;oxygen covalency through the metal d orbitals. In BaO covalency outweighs electrostatics because of the large 5d orbitals of Ba, so the unique B8 and dB2 structures form. This marks an important expansion of the importance of d orbitals in group II chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Indole&#8208;2&#8208;Carboxylic Acid Ligand&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Stable Perovskite Nanocrystals for Fast Responsive Photodetector</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cesium lead bromide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) show great potential for photoelectric properties. However, due to their poor stability and the insulating nature of passivating ligands, they suffer from practical applications. Herein, in an approach to passivate NCs surface by introducing a ligand, Indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid (ICA), we synthesized a mixed CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 NCs by ligand&#8208;assisted re&#8208;precipitation approach. Incorporating ICA ligand in place of long chain insulating Oleic acid (OA) effectively reduced the loss of non&#8208;radiative recombination induced by surface trap states. Through all the performed compositional and structural characterization, the existence of CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 mixed NCs was confirmed. The obtained CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 mixed NCs show green emission at 518 nm and superior stability under ambient conditions compared to CsPbBr3 NCs. The photoluminescence (PL) of the CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 mixed NCs increased approximately three times, and the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) increased from 75 &#177; 2% to 94 &#177; 2% as compared to CsPbBr3 NCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Fine Tuning of the Redox&#8208;Active Diguanidine Ligand in Cationic Cobalt Complexes for Electronic Structure Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work we show that the redox chemistry of hexacoordinated cobalt complexes with redox&#8208;active diguanidine ligands could be tuned by modifying the diguanidine and/or the co&#8208;ligands. In this way, one&#8208;electron oxidation could be directed to be either ligand&#8208; or metal&#8208;centered, leading to high&#8208;spin CoII complexes with an oxidized, radical&#8208;monocationic diguanidine ligand (ligand&#8208;centered oxidation), or low&#8208;spin CoIII complexes with a reduced, neutral diguanidine ligand. Further fine tuning of the redox&#8208;active diguanidine ligand leads to a harmonization of the energies of both redox isomers. Consequently, ligand&#8208; as well as metal&#8208;centered one&#8208;electron oxidation is observed, resulting in a mixture of both redox isomers. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations confirm the energetic proximity of the two redox isomers in this bistable system. The results of this work contribute to the development of a directed approach toward the design of bistable cobalt&#8208;guanidine complexes and their possible applications in spin switching devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Zinc(II) Monomeric, Dimeric and Trimeric Photosensitizers with Microsecond&#8208;lived Intra&#8208;Ligand Charge Transfer Excited States Investigated through Time&#8208;resolved Optical and X&#8208;ray Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>ZnII photosensitizers relative to CuI complexes have received less attention due to their energetically&#8208;higher metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer states. Three ZnII complexes namely a Monomer, a bimetallic helicate and a trimetallic helicate, bearing phenanthroline ligands are hereby studied through time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray absorption (tr&#8208;XAS) and femto&#8208;microsecond optical transient absorption spectroscopy (OTA). The formation of intraligand singlet charge transfer (IILCT) excited states is achieved within femtoseconds, followed by intersystem crossing (ISC) in nanoseconds to generate microsecond&#8208;lived triplet (3ILCT) states. Femtosecond OTA shows that the 1ILCT states in the Monomer, Dimer and Trimer occur within 235 fs, 683 fs and 730 fs, respectively, while &#160;nano&#8208;microsecond OTA and tr&#8208;XAS show their 3ILCT states &#160;to decay within 1.00 &#181;s, 1.48 &#181;s and 1.51 &#181;s. The ISC from the 1ILCT to the 3ILCT state for the Trimer is 42.8 ns compared to the Monomer and Dimer with ISC rates less than 13 ns. These differences arise due to the stabilization by &#960;&#8208;&#960; and CH&#8208;&#960; non&#8208;covalent interactions of the phenanthroline ligands. The dihedral and torsional angles indicate stronger ligand strains in the excited states of the Dimer and Trimer vs the Monomer. DFT calculations for the electrochemical oxidation potentials further highlight their capability in inducing&#160;photoredox processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Properties of an Aryloxenium Cation with a Triplet Electronic Ground State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryloxenium cations contain a formally positively&#8208;charged, monovalent oxygen atom with an incomplete electron shell. In spite of this unusual structural element, they are key intermediates in many important processes, such as biological oxidation reactions and the industrial generation of thermoplastics. However, the development of new applications is hindered by the lack of knowledge on their fundamental chemical properties. While most past studies have focused on aryloxenium cations with singlet electronic ground states, minor structural modifications can produce aryloxenium cations that have a triplet ground state. Unfortunately, examination of the reactivity of triplet aryloxenium cations is limited to just two studies that reported the detection of H atom abstraction from solvents. A detailed kinetic reactivity study involving cyclohexane, allyl iodide and dimethyl disulfide reagents is reported here for an aryloxenium cation with a triplet electronic ground state, the 2&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;pyridyloxenium cation.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitroreductase&#8208;Responsive Bioorthogonal Tetrazine Conjugations in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prodrugs in response to tumor overexpressed enzymes offer a targeted approach for cancer therapy. However, this strategy faces several challenges, including poor water solubility, off&#8208;target effects, and tumor heterogeneity. To address these limitations, this study developed a novel class of nitroreductase&#8208;responsive tetrazine precursors by employing nitrobenzyl as a masking group for dihydrotetrazines (NBdTz), which can be further functionalized with targeting peptides. Furthermore, we have demonstrated a dual tumor&#8208;selective on demand bioorthogonal prodrug activation enabled by RGD&#8208;NBdTz. RGD promotes tumor cellular uptake by interacting with tumor&#8208;associated integrin &#945;v&#946;3, and subsequent enzymatic reduction of aromatic nitro group of NBdTz by overexpressed NTR among hypoxic tumor microenvironment leads to the liberation of the bioorthogonal handle tetrazine, resulting in the anticipated bioorthogonal activation of trans&#8208;cyclooctene caged payloads through "click&#8208;to&#8208;release" reactions. We envision the presented NBdTz enabled tumor&#8208;selective on demand tetrazine ligation offers new opportunities for cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Bistricyclic Aromatic Enes Containing Bifluorenylidene Units via Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Tandem Suzuki Coupling/Heck Cyclization Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A variety of bifluorenylidene&#8208;based bistricyclic aromatic enes (BAEs) and their derivatives have been prepared via the palladium&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki coupling/Heck cyclization tandem reaction in one pot. In the new scheme 2&#8208;bromophenyl trifluoromethanesulfonate and similar derivatives were chosen as one of reaction substrates, which could undergo tandem Suzuki coupling/Heck cyclization reaction with suitable arylboronic acid ester substrates to afford the expected BAEs and their derivatives. In the newly designed scheme, the raw materials are easier to obtain and can be applied to the synthesis of more BAEs and their derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>1,3&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;Zwitterionic Complexes of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes in Reactions with Arylallenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of 2&#8208;arylcyclopropane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylates (ACDC) with GaCl3 and other Lewis acids in the presence of 3&#8208;arylbuta&#8208;1,2&#8208;dienes, which acts as a trapping agent for the 1,2&#8208; or 1,3&#8208;zwitterionic intermediates being generated, has been studied. The reaction of 1,2&#8208;zwitterionic gallium complexes at low temperature has been found to give products of annulation at the phenyl substituent in the allene, 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;(inden&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethylmalonates, as the main products. Only in the case of naphthylcyclopropanedicarboxylate, the formation of a polycyclic frame by annulation at both aromatic moieties occurred upon an increase in temperature to 0&#176;C. Trapping of 1,3&#8208;zwitterions, the primary intermediates of cyclopropane ring opening, by the indicated allene was most successful if catalytic amounts of GaCl3 were added directly to the reaction mixture. In this case, the reaction followed the pathway of the usual formal (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition of 1,3&#8208;zwitterions at each of the double bonds of the allene to give the corresponding exo&#8208;methylenecyclopentane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylates in up to 93% yields. This process occurred with the highest efficiency at the unsubstituted double bond of 3&#8208;arylbuta&#8208;1,2&#8208;diene.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Seawater Oxygen Evolution with Improved Electronic Environment of NiCoPS through Fluorine Doping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing economical and robust electrocatalysts to prevent chlorine ions corrosion and improve seawater splitting efficiency is essential for seawater electrolysis. Herein, fluorine&#8208;doped nickel cobalt phospho&#8208;sulfide nanowires (F&#8208;NiCoPS NWs) were synthesized as high&#8208;performance catalysts for overall seawater splitting. The strongly electronegative F anion is favorable to build weak metal fluorine bonds, which easily break to generate highly active species of Ni/Co&#8208;hydroxides/oxyhydroxides protective layer on the electrode surface. This process effectively avoids chlorine evolution reaction (ClER)&#8208;induced dissolution, and enhances the stability of catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the electronegative fluorine affects the electronic structure of the catalyst&#8217; surface, further enhancing the adsorption energy and electronic conductivity of the reaction intermediates. F&#8208;NiCoPS with appropriate F doping significantly decreased the overpotential (228 (303) mV at 10 (100) mA cm&#8208;2) and the Tafel slope (44 mV dec&#8208;1) in alkaline seawater, and exhibited a long stability of 100 h. This work provides new insights for constructing effective, cost&#8208;efficient and non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalyst for alkaline seawater splitting.</dc:description>
