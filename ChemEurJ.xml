Insight into the structural, electronic, bonding and photophysical properties of these two molecules are presented. Joint experimental and theoretical studies reveal the protonated form of DAGUN possesses an intramolecular N&#8231;&#8231;&#8231;H&#8208;N hydrogen bond which affords a high experimental pKBH+  of 26.6 (computed = 26.3). Photophysical studies show that in solution DAGUN displays a green emission at 534 nm, with a large Stokes shift of 235 nm (14,718 cm  &#8208;1&#160;). In contrast, the conjugate acid DAGUN&#8208;H  +  is only weakly emissive due to attenuated intramolecular charge transfer. X&#8208;ray diffraction studies reveal that DAGBO contains a stable tetracoordinate boronium cation, reminiscent of the well&#8208;established BODIPY family of dyes. In solution, DAGBO exhibits a strong blue emission at 450 nm coupled with a large Stokes shift (&#8710;&#955; = 158 nm (&#8710;&#957; = 11,957 cm  &#8208;1  )) and quantum yield of 62%, upon excitation at 293 nm. DAGBO sets the stage as the first entry into a new class of boron&#8208;difluoride diaminonaphthalenes (BOFDANs) that represent highly fluorescent and tunable next generation dyes with future promise for biosensing and bioimaging applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Octaboraneyl Complexes of Nickel: Monomers for Redox&#8208;Active Coordination Polymers</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, we establish the preparation, characterization, and reactivity of a new diphosphine ligand,&#160;1,2&#8208; bis (di(3&#8208;dicyclohexylpropylboraneyl)phosphino)ethane (P 2 B Cy 4 ), a scaffold that contains tetraboraneyl functionality.

In the case of&#160;4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine , an air&#8208;sensitive coordination polymer is obtained. Characterization of this material by solid&#8208;state NMR and EPR spectroscopy reveals the presence of a charge transfer polymer, which forms as a function of intramolecular Ni&#160;&#8594;&#160;4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpy electron transfer (ET), providing an array of oxidized nickel&#160;and reduced&#160;4,4'&#8208;bpy radical anion sites.

      <title>Fast Acquisition of Proton Detected HETCOR Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectra of Quadrupolar Nuclei and Rapid Measurement of NH Bond Lengths by Frequency Selective HMQC and RESPDOR Pulse Sequences</title>
      <dc:description>Fast magic angle spinning (MAS), frequency selective (FS) heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC) experiments which function in an analogous manner to solution SOFAST HMQC NMR experiments, are demonstrated. Fast MAS enables efficient FS excitation of  1  H solid&#8208;state NMR signals. Selective excitation and observation preserves  1  H magnetization, leading to a significant shortening of the optimal inter&#8208;scan delay.

      <dc:description>The seminal contribution of Rolf Huisgen to develop the [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of 1,3&#8208;dipolar compounds, its azide&#8208;alkyne variant has established itself as the key step in numerous organic syntheses and bioorthogonal processes in materials science and chemical biology. In the present study, the copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition was applied for the development of a modular molecular platform for medical imaging of the prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), using positron emission tomography. This process is shown from molecular design, through synthesis automation and in vitro studies, all the way to preclinical in vivo evaluation of fluorine&#8208;18&#8211; labeled PSMA&#8208;targeting &#8216;F&#8208;PSMA&#8208;MIC&#8217; radiotracers (t&#189; = 109.7 min). Preclinical data indicate that the modular PSMA&#8208;scaffold has similar binding affinity and imaging properties to the clinically used [68Ga]PSMA&#8208;11. Furthermore, we demonstrated that targeting the arene&#8208;binding in PSMA, facilitated through the [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition, can improve binding affinity, which was rationalized by molecular modeling. The here presented PSMA&#8208;binding scaffold potentially facilitates easy coupling to other medical imaging moieties, enabling future developments of new modular imaging agents.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>We describe the first thiourea&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;F bond activation reaction. The use of a thiourea catalyst and Ti(OiPr)4 as a fluoride scavenger allows the amination of benzylic fluorides to proceed in moderate to excellent yields. Preliminary results with S&#8208; and O&#8208;based nucleophiles are also presented. DFT calculations reveal the importance of hydrogen bonds between the catalyst and the fluorine atom of the substrate to lower the activation energy during the transition state.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We describe the first thiourea&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;F bond activation reaction. The use of a thiourea catalyst and Ti(OiPr)4 as a fluoride scavenger allows the amination of benzylic fluorides to proceed in moderate to excellent yields. Preliminary results with S&#8208; and O&#8208;based nucleophiles are also presented. DFT calculations reveal the importance of hydrogen bonds between the catalyst and the fluorine atom of the substrate to lower the activation energy during the transition state.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A Resin&#8208;Supported Formate Catalyst for the Transformative Reduction of Carbon Dioxide with Hydrosilanes</title>
      <dc:description>A heterogeneous formate anion catalyst for the transformative reduction of carbon dioxide (CO  2  ) based on a polystyrene and divinylbenzene copolymer modified with alkylammonium formate was prepared from a widely available anion exchange resin. The catalyst preparation was easy and the characterization was carried out using elemental analysis, Fourier transform infrared (FT&#8208;IR) spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and solid&#8208;state  13  C cross&#8208;polarization/magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (  13  C CP/MAS NMR) spectroscopy. The catalyst displayed good catalytic activity for the direct reduction of CO  2  with hydrosilanes, tunably yielding silylformate or methoxysilane products depending on the hydrosilanes used. The catalyst was also active for the reductive insertion of CO  2  into both primary and secondary amines. The catalytic activity of the resin&#8208;supported formate can be predicted from the FT&#8208;IR spectra of the catalyst, probably because of the difference in the ionic interaction strength between the supported alkylammonium cations and formate anions. The ion pair density is thought to influence the catalytic activity, as shown by the elemental and solid&#8208;state  13  C NMR analyses.</dc:description>

Sharing a shell: Porous Si&#8208;Cu3Si&#8208;Cu microsphere@C core&#8211;shell composites fabricated by an etching/electroless deposition and subsequent carbon coating show excellent lithium storage performance.







Abstract
Low&#8208;cost Si&#8208;based anode materials with excellent electrochemical lithium storage present attractive prospects for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Herein, porous Si&#8208;Cu3Si&#8208;Cu microsphere@C composites are designed and prepared by means of an etching/electroless deposition and subsequent carbon coating. The composites show a core&#8211;shell structure, with a porous Si/Cu microsphere core surrounded by the N&#8208;doped carbon shell. The Cu and Cu3Si nanoparticles are embedded inside porous silicon microspheres, forming the porous Si/Cu microsphere core. The microstructure and lithium storage performance of porous Si&#8208;Cu3Si&#8208;Cu microsphere@C composites can be effectively tuned by changing electroless deposition time. The Si&#8208;Cu3Si&#8208;Cu microsphere@C composite prepared with 12&#8197;min electroless deposition delivers a reversible capacity of 627&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200&#8197;cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, showing an enhanced lithium storage ability. The superior lithium storage performance of the Si&#8208;Cu3Si&#8208;Cu microsphere@C composite can be ascribed to the improved electronic conductivity, enhanced mechanical stability, and better buffering against the large volume change in the repeated lithiation/delithiation processes.

      <title>A Study of Magnetic Relaxation in Dysprosium(III) Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets
</title>
      <dc:description>
Pyramid scheme: An extended and systematic study of a family of lanthanide single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) with pentagonal&#8208;bipyramidal geometry reveals the relaxation parameters and correlations. The energy barriers correlate with structure, mainly the electronegativity of donor atoms on the axial sites (the axial Dy&#8722;X bond lengths), and the energy barriers correlate with the blocking and hysteresis temperatures.







Abstract
Although the development of single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) is rapid, there are only two families of high energy barrier (Ueff) dysprosium(III) SMMs known so far: the cyclopentadienyl (Cp) family with a sandwich structure and the pentagonal&#8208;bipyramidal (PB) family with D5h symmetry. These high&#8208;barrier SMMs, which usually possess Ueff&gt;500&#8197;cm&#8722;1 allow the separate study of the four magnetic relaxation paths, namely, direct, quantum tunnelling, Raman and Orbach processes, in detail. Whereas the first family is chemically more challenging to modify the Cp rings, it is shown herein that the latter family, with the common formulae [DyX1X2(Leq)5]+, such as X1/X2=&#8722;OCMe3, &#8722;OSiMe3, &#8722;OPh, Cl&#8722; or Br&#8722;; Leq=THF/pyridine/4&#8208;methylpyridine, can be readily fine&#8208;tuned with a range of axial and equatorial ligands by simple substitution reactions. This allows unambiguous confirmation that the Ueff mainly depends on the identity of X1 and X2, rather than on Leq. More importantly, the fitted parameters are barrier dependent. If X1 is an O donor and X2 is a halide, 500&lt;Ueff&lt;600&#8197;cm&#8722;1, log&#8201;&#964;0avg (s)=&#8722;10.66, log&#8201;Cavg (s&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;n)= &#8722;5.05, navg=4.1 and TH=9&#8197;K (in which &#964;0 is the pre&#8208;exponential factor for the Orbach relaxation process, C and n are parameters used to describe Raman relaxation, and TH is the highest temperature at which magnetic hysteresis is observed). For cases in which both X1 and X2 are O donors, 900&lt;Ueff&lt;1300&#8197;cm&#8722;1, log&#8201;&#964;0avg (s)=&#8722;11.63, log&#8201;Cavg (s&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;n)= &#8722;6.03, navg=4.1 and 18&lt;TH&lt;25&#8197;K. Based on these results, it can be further concluded that Ueff not only has a linear correlation to the axial Dy&#8722;X bond lengths, but also to TH for these PB SMMs. This represents the first systematic study of a family of lanthanide SMMs and derives the first magneto&#8208;structural correlation in Dy SMMs.

     alt="A Study of Magnetic Relaxation in Dysprosium(III) Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pyramid scheme&lt;/b&gt;: An extended and systematic study of a family of lanthanide single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) with pentagonal&#8208;bipyramidal geometry reveals the relaxation parameters and correlations. The energy barriers correlate with structure, mainly the electronegativity of donor atoms on the axial sites (the axial Dy&#8722;X bond lengths), and the energy barriers correlate with the blocking and hysteresis temperatures.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the development of single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) is rapid, there are only two families of high energy barrier (&lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt;) dysprosium(III) SMMs known so far: the cyclopentadienyl (Cp) family with a sandwich structure and the pentagonal&#8208;bipyramidal (PB) family with &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry. These high&#8208;barrier SMMs, which usually possess &lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gt;500&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; allow the separate study of the four magnetic relaxation paths, namely, direct, quantum tunnelling, Raman and Orbach processes, in detail. Whereas the first family is chemically more challenging to modify the Cp rings, it is shown herein that the latter family, with the common formulae [DyX&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;X&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(L&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, such as X&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/X&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;OCMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;OSiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;OPh, Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; or Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;; L&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;=THF/pyridine/4&#8208;methylpyridine, can be readily fine&#8208;tuned with a range of axial and equatorial ligands by simple substitution reactions. This allows unambiguous confirmation that the &lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; mainly depends on the identity of X&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and X&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, rather than on L&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;. More importantly, the fitted parameters are barrier dependent. If X&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is an O donor and X&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is a halide, 500&amp;lt;&lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;lt;600&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, log&#8201;&lt;i&gt;&#964;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;0avg&lt;/sub&gt; (s)=&#8722;10.66, log&#8201;&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;avg&lt;/sub&gt; (s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;)= &#8722;5.05, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;avg&lt;/sub&gt;=4.1 and &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;=9&#8197;K (in which &lt;i&gt;&#964;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the pre&#8208;exponential factor for the Orbach relaxation process, &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; are parameters used to describe Raman relaxation, and &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; is the highest temperature at which magnetic hysteresis is observed). For cases in which both X&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and X&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are O donors, 900&amp;lt;&lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;lt;1300&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, log&#8201;&lt;i&gt;&#964;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;0avg&lt;/sub&gt; (s)=&#8722;11.63, log&#8201;&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;avg&lt;/sub&gt; (s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;)= &#8722;6.03, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;avg&lt;/sub&gt;=4.1 and 18&amp;lt;&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;lt;25&#8197;K. Based on these results, it can be further concluded that &lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; not only has a linear correlation to the axial Dy&#8722;X bond lengths, but also to &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; for these PB SMMs. This represents the first systematic study of a family of lanthanide SMMs and derives the first magneto&#8208;structural correlation in Dy SMMs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Two Rare&#8208;Earth Molecular Ferroelectrics with High Curie Temperatures, Large Spontaneous Polarization, Switchable Second Harmonic Generation Effects, and Strong Photoluminescence</title>
      <dc:description>
Multifunctional ferroelectrics: Two rare&#8208;earth metal molecular ferroelectrics are synthesized: (nBu4N)3[M(NO3)x(SCN)y] (M=Nd, Pr). The two compounds have strong on&#8211;off second harmonic generation effects, and fluorescence characteristics that are adjustable from bright yellow&#8211;red to green light simply by changing the rare&#8208;earth ion. These novel multifunctional molecular ferroelectric materials are promising for future applications.







Abstract
Smart multifunctional molecular ferroelectrics bearing high Curie temperatures and diverse excellent physical properties, such as second harmonic generation (SHG) responses, luminescence, and semiconductivity, among others, have significant applications but have seldom been documented. Herein, the rare&#8208;earth metals Nd and Pr are introduced into a simple molecular system (nBu4N)3[M(NO3)x(SCN)y] (nBu4N=tetrabutyl ammonium, M=rare&#8208;earth metal, nBu=CH3CH2CH2CH2), and two new multifunctional molecular ferroelectrics are obtained: (nBu4N)3[Nd(NO3)4(SCN)2] (1) and (nBu4N)3[Pr(NO3)4(SCN)2] (2). Their distinct heat and dielectric anomaly dependence on temperature verifies that compounds&#8197;1 and 2 experience high&#8208;temperature para&#8208;ferroelectric phase transitions at 408 and 413&#8197;K, respectively. Strikingly, both molecular ferroelectrics possess large spontaneous polarization with Ps values of 9.05 and 8.50&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively, and are further characterized by the appearance of multiple intersecting non&#8208;180&#176; domains and polarization switching behavior. In particular, compounds&#8197;1 and 2 show good stability with only a small decrease in SHG intensity after switching cycles, suggesting that they have great potential for application in nonlinear optical (NLO) switches. Simultaneously, the rare&#8208;earth compounds&#8197;1 and 2 present bright yellow&#8211;red and bright green fluorescence, respectively, at room temperature.

      <title>Surface Design for Immobilization of an Antimicrobial Peptide Mimic for Efficient Anti&#8208;Biofouling</title>
      <dc:description>
Efficient anti&#8208;biofouling: We show that an archetypical antimicrobial peptoid could retain high activity even with terminal modifications. Immobilization by alkyne&#8211;azide &#8222;click&#8220; coupling on one&#8208;step modified amino&#8208;surfaces was demonstrated. Appropriate spatial separation between immobilized peptoids, rather than increasing surface density, was found to promote both resistance against bacterial attachment and AMP surface activity.







Abstract
Microbial surface attachment negatively impacts a wide range of devices from water purification membranes to biomedical implants. Mimics of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) constituted from poly(N&#8208;substituted glycine) &#8222;peptoids&#8220; are of great interest as they resist proteolysis and can inhibit a wide spectrum of microbes. We investigate how terminal modification of a peptoid AMP&#8208;mimic and its surface immobilization affect antimicrobial activity. We also demonstrate a convenient surface modification strategy for enabling alkyne&#8211;azide &#8222;click&#8220; coupling on amino&#8208;functionalized surfaces. Our results verified that the N&#8208; and C&#8208;terminal peptoid structures are not required for antimicrobial activity. Moreover, our peptoid immobilization density and choice of PEG tether resulted in a &#8222;volumetric&#8220; spatial separation between AMPs that, compared to past studies, enabled the highest AMP surface activity relative to bacterial attachment. Our analysis suggests the importance of spatial flexibility for membrane activity and that AMP separation may be a controlling parameter for optimizing surface anti&#8208;biofouling.

      <title>Synthetic Ellagic Acid Glycosides Inhibit Early Stage Adhesion of Streptococcus agalactiae Biofilms as Observed by Scanning Electron Microscopy</title>
      <dc:description>
Synthetic ellagic acid glycosides possess carbohydrate&#8208;specific antibiofilm activity against Streptococcus agalactiae. SEM has revealed that these compounds likely inhibit early stage bacterial adhesion mechanisms. Additionally, these compounds possess antimicrobial activity against gram&#8208;negative ESKAPE pathogens, further broadening the antibiotic profile of synthetic ellagic acid glycosides (see figure).







Abstract
Ellagic acid derivatives possess antimicrobial and antibiofilm properties across a wide&#8208;range of microbial pathogens. Due to their poor solubility and ambident reactivity it is challenging to synthesize, purify, and characterize the activity of ellagic acid glycosides. In this study, we have synthesized three ellagic acid glycoconjugates and evaluated their antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity in Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus, GBS). Their significant impacts on biofilm formation were examined via SEM to reveal early&#8208;stage inhibition of cellular adhesion. Additionally, the synthetic glycosides were evaluated against five of the six ESKAPE pathogens and two fungal pathogens. These studies reveal that the ellagic acid glycosides possess inhibitory effects on the growth of gram&#8208;negative pathogens.

      <title>Chiral Bent&#8208;Shaped Molecules Exhibiting Unusually Wide Range of Blue Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Phases and Multistimuli&#8208;Responsive Behavior</title>
      <dc:description>
Out of shape: A chiral bent&#8208;core liquid crystal is successfully engineered, in which an electronegative chloro moiety is introduced at the transverse position of the central benzene ring. These chiral, bent&#8208;shaped liquid crystals exhibit an unusually wide range of blue phases with multistimuli&#8208;responsive behavior.







Abstract
Recently, an unprecedented observation of polar order, thermochromic behavior, and exotic mesophases in new chiral, bent&#8208;shaped systems with a &#8722;CH3 moiety placed at the transverse position of the central core was reported. Herein, a homologous series of compounds with even&#8208;numbered carbon chains from n=4 to 18 were synthesized, in which &#8722;Cl was substituted for &#8722;CH3 at the kink position and a drastic modification in the phase structure of the bent&#8208;shaped molecule was observed. An unusual stabilization of the cubic blue phase (BP) over a wide range of 16.4&#8201;&#176;C has been witnessed. Two homologues in this series (1&#8208;12 and 1&#8208;14) exhibit an interesting phase sequence consisting of BPI/II, chiral nematic, twist grain boundary, smectic&#8197;A, and smectic&#8197;X (SmX) phases. The higher homologues (1&#8208;16 and 1&#8208;18) stabilize the SmX phase enantiotropically over the entire temperature range. Crystal structure analysis confirmed the bent molecular architecture, with a bent angle of 148&#176;, and revealed the presence of two different molecular conformations in an asymmetric unit of compound 1&#8208;4. A DFT study corroborated that the &#8722;Cl moiety at the central core of the molecule led to an increase in the dipole moment along the transverse direction, which, in turn, facilitated the unusual stabilization of frustrated structures. Crystal polymorphism has been evidenced in three homologues (1&#8208;10, 1&#8208;12, and 1&#8208;14) of the series. On the application of mechanical pressure through grinding, compound 1&#8208;10 transformed from a bright yellow crystalline solid to a dark orange&#8211;green amorphous solid, which reversed upon dropwise addition of dichloromethane, indicating reversible mechanochromism in this class of compounds. In addition, excellent thermochromic behavior has been observed for compound 1&#8208;10 with a controlled temperature&#8211;color combination.

      <title>Synthesis and Supramolecular Functional Assemblies of Ratiometric pH Probes</title>
      <dc:description>
Right on track! Recent synthetic strategies towards the preparation of molecular ratiometric probes for intracellular pH imaging are reviewed. The integration of these pH molecular probes into supramolecular systems allow the fabrication of new sensors with enhanced selectivity and sensitivity.







Abstract
Tracking pH with spatiotemporal resolution is a critical challenge for synthetic chemistry, chemical biology and beyond. Over the last decade, different small probes and supramolecular systems have emerged for in cellulo or in vivo pH tracking. However, pH reporting still presents critical limitations, such as background reduction, improved sensor stability, cell targeting, endosomal escape, near&#8208; and far&#8208;infrared ratiometric pH tracking and adaption to new imaging techniques (i.e., super&#8208;resolution). These challenges will require the combined efforts of synthetic and supramolecular chemistry working together to develop the next generation of smart materials that will resolve current limitations. Herein, recent advances in the synthesis of small fluorescent probes, together with new supramolecular functional systems employed for pH tracking, are described with an emphasis on ratiometric probes. The combination of organic synthesis and stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular functional materials will be essential to solve future challenges of pH tracking, such as improved signal to noise ratio, on target activation and microenvironment reporting.

Abstract
New redox&#8208;active 1,2,5,6&#8208;tetrakis(guanidino)&#8208;naphthalene compounds, isolable and storable in the neutral and deep&#8208;green dicationic redox states and oxidisable further in two one&#8208;electron steps to the tetracations, are reported. Protonation switches on blue fluorescence, with the fluorescence intensity (quantum yield) increasing with the degree of protonation. Reactions with N&#8208;halogenosuccinimides or N&#8208;halogenophthalimides led to a series of new redox&#8208;active halogeno&#8208; and succinimido&#8208;/phthalimido&#8208;substituted derivatives. These highly selective reactions are proposed to proceed via the tri&#8208; or tetracationic state as the intermediate. The derivatives are oxidised reversibly at slightly higher potentials than that of the unsubstituted compounds to dications and further to tri&#8208; and tetracations. The integration of redox&#8208;active ligands in the transition&#8208;metal complexes shifts the redox potentials to higher values and also allows reversible oxidation in two potentially separated one&#8208;electron steps.

      <title>Effect of Phosphorylation on the Structural Behaviour of Peptides Derived from the Intrinsically Disordered C&#8208;Terminal Domain of Histone H1.0</title>
      <dc:description>
Spot the differences! Based on the NMR data of model peptides, the TPKK and TPVK phosphorylation motifs that are present in the intrinsically disordered C&#8208;terminal domain of histone H1.0 show the same backbone conformations when phosphorylated and non&#8208;phosphorylated, but different side&#8208;chain interactions (see figure). Furthermore, the phospho&#8208;threonine pKa in the TPKK motif is much lower than the intrinsic one, whereas in the TPVK motif it is only slightly lower.







Abstract
To investigate the structural impact of phosphorylation on the human histone H1.0 C&#8208;terminal domain, we performed NMR structural studies of model peptides containing a single phosphorylation site: T118&#8208;H1.0 (T118PKK motif) and T140&#8208;H1.0 (T140PVK motif). Both model peptides are mainly disordered in aqueous solution in their non&#8208;phosphorylated and phosphorylated forms, but become structured in the presence of trifluoroethanol. The peptides T118&#8208;H1.0 and pT118&#8208;H1.0 contain two helical regions, a long amphipathic &#945; helix spanning residues 104&#8211;115 and a short &#945;/310 helix (residues 119&#8211;123), that are almost perpendicular in T118&#8208;H1.0 but have a poorly defined orientation in pT118&#8208;H1.0. Peptides T140&#8208;H1.0 and pT140&#8208;H1.0 form very similar &#945; helices between residues 141&#8211;147. The TPKK and TPVK motifs show the same backbone conformation, but differ in their side&#8208;chain contacts; the Thr and pThr side chains interact with the i+2 Lys side chain in the TPKK motif, and with the i+3 Lys side chain in the TPVK motif. The pT phosphate group in pT118&#8208;H1.0 and pT140&#8208;H1.0 has pKa values below the intrinsic values, which can be explained by non&#8208;specific charge&#8211;charge interactions with nearby Lys. The non&#8208;polar Val in the TPVK motif accounts for the pT140 pKa being closer to the intrinsic pKa value than the pT118 pKa. Altogether, these results validate that minimalist strategies using model peptides can provide structural details difficult to obtain in short&#8208;lived intrinsically disordered proteins and domains.

&lt;p&gt;To investigate the structural impact of phosphorylation on the human histone H1.0 C&#8208;terminal domain, we performed NMR structural studies of model peptides containing a single phosphorylation site: T&lt;sup&gt;118&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;H1.0 (T&lt;sup&gt;118&lt;/sup&gt;PKK motif) and T&lt;sup&gt;140&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;H1.0 (T&lt;sup&gt;140&lt;/sup&gt;PVK motif). Both model peptides are mainly disordered in aqueous solution in their non&#8208;phosphorylated and phosphorylated forms, but become structured in the presence of trifluoroethanol. The peptides T&lt;sup&gt;118&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;H1.0 and pT&lt;sup&gt;118&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;H1.0 contain two helical regions, a long amphipathic &#945; helix spanning residues 104&#8211;115 and a short &#945;/3&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; helix (residues 119&#8211;123), that are almost perpendicular in T&lt;sup&gt;118&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;H1.0 but have a poorly defined orientation in pT&lt;sup&gt;118&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;H1.0. Peptides T&lt;sup&gt;140&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;H1.0 and pT&lt;sup&gt;140&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;H1.0 form very similar &#945; helices between residues 141&#8211;147. The TPKK and TPVK motifs show the same backbone conformation, but differ in their side&#8208;chain contacts; the Thr and pThr side chains interact with the &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;+2 Lys side chain in the TPKK motif, and with the &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;+3 Lys side chain in the TPVK motif. The pT phosphate group in pT&lt;sup&gt;118&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;H1.0 and pT&lt;sup&gt;140&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;H1.0 has p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values below the intrinsic values, which can be explained by non&#8208;specific charge&#8211;charge interactions with nearby Lys. The non&#8208;polar Val in the TPVK motif accounts for the pT&lt;sup&gt;140&lt;/sup&gt; p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; being closer to the intrinsic p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; value than the pT&lt;sup&gt;118&lt;/sup&gt; p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;. Altogether, these results validate that minimalist strategies using model peptides can provide structural details difficult to obtain in short&#8208;lived intrinsically disordered proteins and domains.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Novel Visible Range FRET Probe for Monitoring Acid Sphingomyelinase Activity in Living Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
More than just FRET: A visible range FRET probe for acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) was developed. The fluorescence increase is &gt;100 fold and additionally fueled by environmental sensitivity of the fluorescein dye. The probe was used for analysis of live cell ASM activities by flow cytometry.







Abstract
Activity of acid sphingomyelinase has been implicated in a number of diseases like acute lung injury, sepsis or metastasis of melanoma cells. Here, we present a sphingomyelinase FRET probe based on FAM/BODIPY dyes for real&#8208;time monitoring of acid sphingomyelinase. The probe gives rise to a tremendous increase in fluorescence of the fluorescein FRET donor upon cleavage and we show that this is, to a significant part, due to cleavage&#8208;associated phase transition, suggesting a more systematic consideration of such effects for future probe development. The probe allows for the first time to monitor relative sphingomyelinase activities of intact living cells by flow cytometry.

      <title>Parallel Versus Antiparallel &#946;&#8208;Sheet Structure in Cyclic Peptide Hybrids Containing &#947;&#8208; or &#948;&#8208;Cyclic Amino Acids</title>
      <dc:description>
Cycles and tubes: Cyclic peptides containing aminocycloalkanecarboxylic acid alternated with &#945;&#8208;residues stack preferably in parallel&#8208;like &#946;&#8208;sheet structures.







Abstract
Cyclic peptides with disc&#8208;shaped structures have emerged as potent building blocks for the preparation of new biomaterials in fields ranging from biological to material science. In this work, we analyze in depth the self&#8208;assembling properties of a new type of cyclic peptides based on the alternation of &#945;&#8208;residues and cyclic &#948;&#8208;amino acids (&#945;,&#948;&#8208;CPs). To examine the preferred stacking properties adopted by cyclic peptides bearing this type of amino acids, we carried out a synergistic in vitro/in silico approximation by using simple dimeric models and then extended to nanotubes. Although these new cyclic peptides (&#945;,&#948;&#8208;CPs) can interact either in a parallel or antiparallel fashion, our results confirm that although the parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet is more stable, it can be switched to the antiparallel stacking by choosing residues that can establish favorable cross&#8208;strand interactions. Moreover, the subsequent comparison by using the same methodology but applied to &#945;,&#947;&#8208;CPs models, up to the moment assumed as antiparallel&#8208;like d,l&#8208;&#945;&#8208;CPs, led to unforeseen conclusions that put into question preliminary conjectures about these systems. Surprisingly, they tend to adopt a parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet directed by the skeleton interactions. These results imply a change of paradigm with respect to cyclic peptide designs that should be considered for dimers and nanotubes.

      <title>A Chemical History of Polycyclic Musks</title>
      <dc:description>
Seven musks: Seven stories related to the discovery of seven polycyclic aromatic compounds diffusing the smell of musk. Seven chemical endeavors involving organic chemists with great personalities, resulting in immense industrial successes in the second half of the 20th century. Seven musk raw materials that reshaped the course of modern perfumery.







Abstract
Musk odorants are ubiquitous in fine perfumery as well as household products, and are divided into four main families, the nitromusks, the macrocyclic musks, the polycyclic aromatic musks, and the alicyclic musks, following their order of appearance on the perfumery market. This article presents the scientific and industrial adventures during the discovery of the seven commercial polycyclic musks, which invigorated the aroma chemistry corporations during the second half of the 20th century, resulting in relentless competition. Research and development strategies are exposed, and reactivity, analytical, mechanistic, and structure&#8211;activity relationships aspects are discussed as well as some biographical elements of the main scientific actors, and some fine perfumery examples are given as illustrations of their use.

      <title>Graphene/Amorphous Carbon Restriction Structure for Stable and Long&#8208;Lifespan Antimony Anode in Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Under cover: A graphene/amorphous carbon restriction structure is designed for an Sb anode, in which the anode is protected from pulverization and aggregation, thus leading to the excellent stability and long lifespan of Sb in K&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Sb&#8208;based materials have attracted much attention owing to their ability to undergo a multi&#8208;electron alloy reaction with K+. However, there are still the serious problems of volume change and aggregation of particles, which lead to rapid capacity fading and a limited lifespan. In this work, a graphene/amorphous carbon restriction structure is proposed, in which the amorphous carbon layer on the surface of Sb nanoparticles can protect the particles from pulverization, and the graphene can buffer the volume change of the material. In addition, the conductive network formed by the dual carbon structure effectively improves the rate performance of the material. Thus, the material delivers a high capacity of 550&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, a rate capability of 370&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, and a long lifespan of 350&#8197;cycles without significant capacity fading. The dual carbon strategy proposed offers a reference for the design of high&#8208;performance anode materials.

      <title>Selectivity over kinetic and thermodynamically driven pathways of crystallization to yield Co&#8208;facial and Slipped Stack dimers in single crystals</title>
      <dc:description>Control over the molecular packing in the solid state is of utmost importance in regulating the bulk optical properties of organic semiconductors. The electronic coupling between the molecules makes it possible to improve the properties of the bulk materials. Herein, we report an example on the control over selectivity  of the formation of  polymorphic single crystals of  25TR  by (i) kinetic or (ii) thermodynamic course of crystallisation to yield slipped stack (  S  ) and co&#8208;facial (  C  ) dimeric type in their single crystals.&#160;&#160;Both the forms show significant excitonic interactions in solid state and eventually the  S&#8208;  dimeric form has strong yellowish orange fluorescence while the  C  &#8208;dimeric form is non fluorescent in their crystalline state. Density functional theory calculations and the differential scanning calorimetric experiments revealed that the  C  &#8208;dimer polymorph is the thermodynamically stable form with a free energy offset of 0.43 eV in comparison to the  S  &#8208;dimer. Interestingly, the thermodynamically driven non&#8208;fluorescent single crystal is found to be convertible to its fluorescent form irreversibly by thermal trigger. The charge carrier&#8208;transport characteristics of these two polymorphs are computed using the Marcus&#8211;Hush formalism. The computational results on the charge carrier transport behaviour revealed that the  S  &#8208;dimer (  25TR  (R)  ) is ambipolar while the  C  &#8208;dimer (  25TR  (Y)  ) is majorly n&#8208;type.</dc:description>

      <title>The Xanthate Route to Indolines, Indoles, and their Aza Congeners</title>
      <dc:description>Convergent routes to a variety of indolines, indoles, oxindoles, and their aza analogues involving radical additions of xanthates are described. Three approaches are summarized. The first is the least general and relies on the generation of aryl or heteroaryl radicals starting from diazonium salts. The second involves radical addition to  N  &#8208;allylanilines followed by ring&#8208;closure onto the aromatic core. A large variety of indolines and azaindolines can thus be obtained and, in many cases, converted into the corresponding indoles and azaindoles by various methods. The synthesis of novel fluoroazaindolines and fluoroazaindoles by a rare homolytic  ipso  &#8208;substitution of fluorine atoms is particularly noteworthy. The last approach hinges on the direct modification of indoles by radical addition to the pyrrole subunit of the indole nucleus. Application of this methodology to the total synthesis of melatonin and the alkaloids mersicarpine, caulerpine, and the pentacyclic skeleton of tronocarpine is briefly discussed. Most of the compounds described herein would be difficult to obtain by more traditional routes.</dc:description>

      <title>Structural Transformation of SnS2 to SnS by Mo Doping Produces Electro/Photocatalyst for Hydrogen Production</title>
      <dc:description>SnS and SnS  2  are layered semiconductors, with potential promising properties for electro&#8208;catalytic and photocatalytic hydrogen (H  2  ) production. The vast knowledge in preparation and modification of layered structures was still not employed successfully in this system to fully maximize its potential. Here, we provide the first report of structural transformation of SnS  2  into SnS with Mo&#8208;doping as a bifunctional catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The structural phase transition optimized the properties of the material, providing a more delicate morphology with additional catalytic sites.

The same structure acts as an efficient photocatalyst in the generation of H  2  from water under visible illumination with rate of 0.136 mmole/g&#8729;h of H  2  , which is 20 times higher than pristine SnS  2  under visible light.</dc:description>

      <title>Noncovalent Functionalization of Few&#8208;Layered Antimonene with Fullerene Clusters and Photoinduced Charge Separation in the Composite</title>
      <dc:description>Few&#8208;layered a ntimonene (FLSb) nanosheets were noncovalently functionalized with fullerene C  60  clusters by quick addition of a poor solvent (i.e., acetonitrile) into a mixed dispersion of FLSb and C  60  in a good solvent (i.e., toluene). In a flash&#8208;photolysis time&#8208;resolved microwave conductivity (FP&#8208;TRMC) measurement, the FLSb&#8211;C  60  composite, (FLSb+C  60  )  m  , showed a rapid rise in transient conductivity, whereas no conductivity signal was observed in the single components, FLSb and C  60  . This demonstrated the occurrence of photoinduced charge separation between FLSb and C  60  in (FLSb+C  60  )  m  . Furthermore, a photoelectrochemical device with an electrophoretically deposited (FLSb+C  60  )  m  film exhibited an enhanced efficiency of photocurrent generation, compared to th ose of the single&#8208;components, FLSb and C  60  , due to the photoinduced charge separation between FLSb and C  60  .

      <title>Kinetics of Photoinduced Reactions at the Single&#8208;Molecule Level: The KACB Method
</title>
      <dc:description>
Blink, don't FRET! The kinetics of photoinduced reactions can be accessed through fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. By measuring the OFF time during blinking, the lifetimes of photoinduced intermediates, such as triplet, radical ion, and isomerized states, can be determined.







Abstract
The kinetics of photoinduced reactions can be approached by laser flash photolysis techniques. Although such techniques allow for a detailed understanding of the important photophysics of molecules, they normally require a substantial amount of sample for measurements (&gt;1&#8197;nmol), and thus, they are difficult to apply to analytical and diagnostic applications. The photophysics of a fluorescent molecule can be accessed by monitoring the kinetics of the fluctuation of fluorescence, which is called blinking. Blinking is a phenomenon that can be monitored only if molecules are observed at the single&#8208;molecule level. In bulk solution, blinking kinetics can be measured by using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), which normally requires more than 105 times less sample than that required for laser flash photolysis. Blinking is controlled to extract fruitful microenvironmental information around a fluorescent molecule, by using a method named kinetic analysis based on the control of fluorescence blinking (KACB). This Concept highlights the adaption of the KACB method to investigate the local conformation of DNA with less than 1&#8197;pmol of DNA sample.

      <title>Mononuclear to Polynuclear UIV Structural Units: Effects of Reaction Conditions on U&#8208;Furoate Phase Formation</title>
      <dc:description>
U what? Five UIV&#8208;furoate compounds were isolated through the examination of reaction conditions on phase formation. Solid&#8208;state structural investigations showed that variation in the synthetic parameters led to notable differences in the structural chemistry, with ligand bridged mononuclear units to tetranuclear and hexanuclear units, and large polyoxo {U38}&#8208;clusters isolated under fairly similar synthetic conditions. For all reaction solutions, increasing the temperature resulted in the formation of UO2 nanoparticles.







Abstract
Uranium(IV) complexation by 2&#8208;furoic acid (2&#8208;FA) was examined to better understand the effects of ligand identity and reaction conditions on species formation and stability. Five compounds were isolated: [UCl2(2&#8208;FA)2(H2O)2]n (1), [U4Cl10O2(THF)6(2&#8208;FA)2]&#8901;2&#8201;THF (2), [U6O4(OH)4(H2O)3(2&#8208;FA)12]&#8901;7&#8201;THF&#8901;H2O (3), [U6O4(OH)4(H2O)2(2&#8208;FA)12]&#8901;8.76&#8201;H2O (4), and [U38Cl42O54(OH)2(H2O)20]&#8901;m&#8201;H2O&#8901;n&#8201;THF (5). The structures were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and further characterized by Raman, IR, and optical absorption spectroscopy. The thermal stability and magnetic behavior of the compounds were also examined. Variations in the synthetic conditions led to notable differences in the structural units observed in the solid state. At low H2O/THF ratios, a tetranuclear oxo&#8208;bridged [U4O2] core was isolated. Aging of this solution resulted in the formation a U38 oxo cluster capped by chloro and water ligands. However, at increasing water concentrations only hexanuclear units were observed. In all cases, at temperatures of 100&#8211;120&#8201;&#176;C, UO2 nanoparticles formed.

      <dc:description>Although oxide nanostructures are ubiquitous in science and technology, a multitude of compositions, phases, structures, and doping levels exist, each one requiring a variety of conditions for their synthesis and modification. Besides, experimental procedures are frequently dominated by high temperatures or pressures and by chemical contaminants or waste.

Here, established laser&#8208;based methodologies are reviewed through the presentation of a panorama of oxide nanoparticles which include pure oxidic phases, as well as unconventional structures like defective or doped oxides, non&#8208;equilibrium compounds, metal&#8208;oxide core&#8208;shells and other anisotropic morphologies. So far, these materials showed several useful properties that are discussed with special emphasis on catalytic, biomedical and optical application.

To that end, this review aims to identify the perspectives and unique opportunities of laser&#8208;based synthesis and processing of colloids for future studies of oxide nanomaterial&#8208;oriented sciences.</dc:description>

      <title>Lithium&#8211;Lanthanide Bimetallic Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks towards Negative Electrode Materials for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Expanded capacity: Three Ln&#8722;Li metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs; Ln=Ce and Pr) were successfully designed and structurally characterized. The unique electrochemical performances of Ln&#8722;Li MOFs lead to promising applications as next&#8208;generation electrode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Novel lithium&#8211;lanthanide (Ln: cerium and praseodymium) bimetallic coordination polymers with formulas C10H2LnLiO8 (Ln: Ce (CeLipma) and Pr (PrLipma)) and C10H3CeO8 (Cepma) were prepared through a simple hydrothermal method. The three compounds were characterized by means of FTIR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, SEM, TEM, and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results of structural refinement show that they belong to triclinic symmetry and P
 space group with cerium (or praseodymium) and lithium cations, forming coordination bonds to oxygen atoms from different pyromellitic acid molecules, and leading to the construction of 3D structures. It is interesting to note that the frameworks exclude any coordination water and lattice water. As an electrode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries, CeLipma exhibits a maximum capacity of 800.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a retention of 91.4&#8201;% after 50 cycles at a current density of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. The favorable electrochemical properties of the lanthanide coordination polymers show potential application prospects in the field of electrode materials.

      <title>Photoswitchable Norbornadiene&#8211;Quadricyclane Interconversion Mediated by Covalently Linked C60</title>
      <dc:description>
Switching! The synthesis of several norbornadiene (NBD)&#8211;fullerene adducts is herein reported. Within these new hybrid systems, the photochemical isomerization of NBD is combined with the electron affinity of C60. This enables the selective light&#8208;induced isomerization of the NBD derivative to its corresponding quadricyclane (QC) counterpart and the back conversion of the latter mediated by the photochemically excited fullerene core.







Abstract
The synthesis and properties of various norbornadiene/quadricyclane (NBD/QC) fullerene hybrids are reported. By cyclopropanation of C60 with malonates carrying the NBD scaffold a small library of NBD&#8211;fullerene monoadducts and NBD&#8211;fullerene hexakisadducts was established. The substitution pattern of the NBD scaffold, as well as the electron affinity of the fullerene core within these hybrid systems, has a pronounced impact on the properties of the corresponding energy rich QC derivatives. Based on this, the first direct photoisomerization of NBD&#8211;fullerene hybrids to their QC derivatives was achieved. Furthermore, it was possible to use the redox&#8208;active fullerene core of a QC&#8211;fullerene monoadduct to enable the back reaction to form the corresponding NBD&#8211;fullerene monoadduct. Combining these two processes enables switching between NBD and QC simply by changing the irradiation wavelength between 310 and 400&#8197;nm. Therefore, turning this usually photo/thermal switch into a pure photoswitch. This not only simplifies the investigation of the underlying processes of the NBD&#8211;QC interconversion within the system, but also renders such hybrids interesting for applications as molecular switches.

      <title>Halogen Bonding Interactions of Polychlorinated Biphenyls and the Potential for Thyroid Disruption</title>
      <dc:description>
Hormones: Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) may halogen bond to deiodinases to prevent the activation of thyroid hormones. DFT calculations suggest mechanisms by which Cl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se interactions and PCB flexibility could disrupt thyroid&#8208;mediated processes (see figure).







Abstract
Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) flame retardants are persistent pollutants and inhibit neurodevelopment, particularly in the early stages of life. Halogen bonding (XB) to the iodothyronine deiodinases (Dio) that modulate thyroid hormones (THs) is a potential mechanism for endocrine disruption. Cl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se XB interactions of PCBs with SeMe&#8722;, a small model of the Dio active site selenocysteine, are compared with previous results on polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs) and THs using density functional theory. PCBs generally display weaker XB interactions compared to PBDEs and THs, consistent with the dependence of XB strength on the size of the halogen (I&gt;Br&gt;Cl). PCBs also do not meet a proposed energy threshold for substrates to undergo dehalogenation, suggesting they may behave as competitive inhibitors of Dio in addition to other mechanisms of endocrine disruption. XB interactions in PCBs are position&#8208;dependent, with ortho interactions slightly more favorable than meta and para interactions, suggesting that PCBs may have a greater effect on certain classes of Dio. Flexibility of PCBs around the biphenyl C&#8722;C bond is limited by ortho substitutions relative to the biphenyl linkage, which may contribute to the ability to inhibit Dio and other TH&#8208;related proteins.

      <title>Cover Feature: Dual Emission from Precious Metal&#8208;Free Luminophores Consisting of C, H, O, Si, and S/P at Room Temperature (Chem. Eur. J. 23/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
Dual emission of fluorescence and phosphorescence whose emission maxima are easily identified by steady&#8208;state measurement is achieved with 2,5&#8208;bis(acceptor)&#8208;1,4&#8208;bis(siloxy)benzenes consisting of C, H, O, Si, and S/P without the aid of precious metals such as iridium and platinum. The dual&#8208;emissive benzenes made it possible to accomplish highly accurate ratiometric luminescence sensing of molecular oxygen and temperature.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dual emission of fluorescence and phosphorescence&lt;/b&gt; whose emission maxima are easily identified by steady&#8208;state measurement is achieved with 2,5&#8208;bis(acceptor)&#8208;1,4&#8208;bis(siloxy)benzenes consisting of C, H, O, Si, and S/P without the aid of precious metals such as iridium and platinum. The dual&#8208;emissive benzenes made it possible to accomplish highly accurate ratiometric luminescence sensing of molecular oxygen and temperature.

      <title>Cover Feature: Photoswitchable Norbornadiene&#8211;Quadricyclane Interconversion Mediated by Covalently Linked C60 (Chem. Eur. J. 23/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
The valence isomerization of norbornadiene (NBD) and quadricyclane (QC) has been widely studied as a potential molecular solar thermal (MOST) energy storage and release system. By combining this interconversion couple with C60 fullerene, a hybrid system with novel properties was created. Within this system, light&#8208;induced switching between NBD and QC in both directions is possible, thereby transforming the former photo/thermal system into a pure photoswitch.

Presently, more than 100 approved drugs or clinical drug candidates contain macrocyclic scaffolds as the biologically active component. An interesting perspective on the use of amino acid&#8208;derived chiral pools versus other methods derived from miscellaneous synthons towards the total synthesis of non&#8208;peptidic macrolides is provided.

      <dc:description>
The SNAr reactions of disubstituted adamantanes bearing halophenol units and 3,6&#8208;dichlorotetrazine afforded cyclophanes and their [2]catenanes. The [2]catenanes were composed of two macrocycles that were singly interlocked and orthogonally arranged. The cyclophanes were assembled to give a supramolecular organic framework in the crystalline state, which indicated permanent porosity and adsorption of green leaf volatiles in a single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal fashion.

      <title>New Aspects of Platinum Group Metal&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;Solution Alloy Nanoparticles: Binary to High&#8208;Entropy Alloys</title>
      <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;solution alloy nanoparticles: Platinum group metal (PGM) alloy nanoparticles (NPs) have been investigated in a variety of research fields, such as catalysis and electronics. Here, recent advances in PGM&#8208;based solid&#8208;solution alloy NPs are focused on, with particular attention to immiscible alloy systems. The concepts, synthesis, and properties of the alloy NPs are introduced, and the existing challenges and future perspectives are discussed.







Abstract
Platinum group metal (PGM) nanoparticles (NPs) have been investigated in a variety of research fields such as catalysis and electronics. Alloying has been recognized as one of the most efficient ways of improving or creating properties in metals. Among the types of alloys, solid&#8208;solution alloy NPs have the advantage of being capable of continuously changing their properties by tuning their composition. However, synthesizing PGM solid&#8208;solution alloy NPs with any combination and composition is not an easy task owing to the metallurgical aspects. In this minireview, the focus is on recent advances in PGM&#8208;based solid&#8208;solution alloy NPs, and in particular those with immiscible alloy systems. Concepts, synthesis, and properties of the alloy NPs are introduced, and the existing challenges and future perspectives are discussed.

      <title>A Comparative Synthetic Strategy Perspective on &#945;&#8208;Amino Acid&#8208; and Non&#8208;Amino Acid&#8208;Derived Synthons towards Total Syntheses of Selected Natural Macrolides</title>
      <dc:description>
Amino versus non&#8208;amino acids: Synthesis of macrolides has always been challenging owing to their structural complexity. This Review provides a perspective on the use of amino acid&#8208;derived and non&#8208;amino acid&#8208;derived synthons towards the synthesis of selected natural macrolides. Synthetic strategies have been assessed on the basis of overall chemical yield, reaction efficiency, and challenging stereochemical transformations.







Abstract
Macrocyclic alkaloids (macrolides) and cyclopeptides have an immense range of applications in drug discovery research because of their natural abundance and potential biological and physicochemical properties. Presently, more than 100 approved drugs or clinical drug candidates contain macrocyclic scaffolds as the biologically active component. This review provides an interesting perspective about the use of amino acid&#8208;derived chiral pools versus other methods derived from miscellaneous synthons towards the total synthesis of non&#8208;peptidic macrolides. The synthetic routes and the key strategies involved in the total syntheses of ten natural macrolides have been discussed. Both the amino acid&#8208;derived and non&#8208;amino acid&#8208;derived synthetic routes have been illustrated to present a comparative study between the two approaches.

      <title>Stabilisation of [WF5]+ and WF5 by Pyridine: Facile Access to [WF5(NC5H5)3]+ and WF5(NC5H5)2</title>
      <dc:description>The enhanced reactivity of [WF  5  ]  +  over WF  6  has been exploited to access a neutral derivative of elusive WF  5  . The reaction of WF  6  (NC  5  H  5  )  2  with [(CH  3  )  3  Si(NC  5  H  5  )][O  3  SCF  3  ] in CH  2  Cl  2  results in quantitative formation of trigonal&#8208;dodecahedral [WF  5  (NC  5  H  5  )  3  ]  +  , which has been characterised as its [O  3  SCF  3  ]  &#8211;  salt by Raman spectroscopy in the solid state and variable&#8208;temperature NMR spectroscopy in solution. The salt is susceptible to slow decomposition in solution at ambient temperature via dissociation of a pyridyl ligand, and the resultant [WF  5  (NC  5  H  5  )  2  ]  +  is reduced to WF  5  (NC  5  H  5  )  2  in the presence of excess C  5  H  5  N, as determined by  19  F NMR spectroscopy. Pentagonal&#8208;bipyramidal WF  5  (NC  5  H  5  )  2  was isolated and characterised by X&#8208;ray crystallography and Raman spectroscopy in the solid state, representing the first unambiguously characterised WF  5  adduct, as well as the first heptacoordinate adduct of a transition&#8208;metal pentafluoride. Density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory (DFT&#8208;B3LYP) methods have been used to investigate the reduction of [WF  5  (NC  5  H  5  )  2  ]  +  to WF  5  (NC  5  H  5  )  2  , supporting a two&#8208;electron reduction of W  VI  to W  IV  via nucleophilic attack and deprotonation of a pyridyl ligand in the presence of free C  5  H  5  N, followed by comproportionation to W  V  .</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Hydrogen production via energy&#8208;efficient electrochemical water electrolysis is a green avenue to meet the development of contemporary society. However, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) occurring on the anode are impeded by the sluggish kinetics reaction during the water&#8208;splitting process. Consequently, it is promising to develop bifunctional anodic electrocatalyst consisting of non&#8208;precious metal. Herein, we report a bifunctional CoMn layered double hydroxides (LDH) grown on nickel foam with a 1D&#8208;2D&#8208;3D hierarchical structure for efficient OER and UOR performance in alkaline solution. Benefited from the significant synergistic effect of Mn doping and heterostrcuture engineering simultaneously, the obtained Co1Mn1 LDH/NF exhibits a satisfactory OER activity with a low potential of 1.515 V to attain 10 mA&#8226;cm&#8208;2. Besides, the potential of Co1Mn1 LDH/NF catalyst for UOR at the same current density is only 1.326 V, much lower than other counterparts and most reported electrocatalysts. Remarkably, a urea electrolytic cell with anodic Co1Mn1 LDH/NF and cathodic Pt&#8208;C/NF electrode is established, then the low cell voltage of 1.354 V at 10 mA&#8226;cm&#8208;2 is acquired. The optimized strategy may endow promising candidates for developing new generation of bifunctional electrocatalysts for clean energy production.</dc:description>

      <title>Solubility&#8208;Driven Isolation of a Metastable Nonagold Cluster with Body&#8208;Centered Cubic Structure</title>
      <dc:description>The conventional synthetic methodology of atomically precise gold nanoclusters using reduction in solutions offers only thermodynamically most stable nanoclusters. We report herein a solubility&#8208;driven isolation strategy to access the synthesis of a metastable gold cluster. The cluster, with the composition of &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;[Au 9 (PPh 3 ) 8 ] + ( 1 ), displays an unusual, nearly perfect body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (bcc) structure. As revealed by ESI&#8208;MS and UV/Vis measurement, the cluster is metastable in solution and converts to the well&#8208;known [Au 11 (PPh 3 ) 8 Cl 2 ] + ( 2 ) within just 90 min. DFT calculations revealed that while both 1 and 2 are eight&#8208;electron superatoms, there is a driving force to convert 1 to 2 as shown by the increased cohesion and larger HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap of 2 . The isolation and crystallization of the metastable gold cluster were achieved in a biphasic reaction system in which reduction of gold precursors and crystallization of 1 took place concurrently. This synthetic protocol represents a successful strategy for investigations of other metastable species in metal nanocluster chemistry.</dc:description>

      <title>Post&#8208;Metalation Modification of Macrocyclic Dicobalt(III) Metallohost by Site&#8208;Selective Ligand Exchange for Guest Recognition Control</title>
      <dc:description>We propose the post&#8208;metalation modification as a useful strategy to control the guest recognition behavior of a metal&#8208;containing macrocyclic host. This is based on the ligand exchange of the axial ligands of a cobalt(III) dinuclear macrocyclic host, [LCo  2  X  4  ]  2+  (X = axial amine ligand). Four piperidine ligands in [LCo  2  (pip)  4  ]  2+  (pip = piperidine) were site&#8208;selectively replaced with primary amines. The competitive experiments revealed that the order of the affinity toward the cobalt centers in [LCo  2  X  4  ]  2+  is primary amine &gt; secondary amine &gt; tertiary amine and that the piperidine&#8208;coordinating complex, [LCo  2  (pip)  4  ]  2+  , was reasonably reactive among the isolable complexes. Indeed, two piperidine ligands at the diagonal positions in [LCo  2  (pip)  4  ]  2+  were site&#8208;selectively replaced with pyridine or acetate ion.

      <title>Cobalt(II)&#8208;Catalyzed [4+2] Annulation of Picolinamides with Alkynes via C&#8722;H Bond Activation</title>
      <dc:description>
Free from any oxidation factor: A co&#8208;oxidant free cobalt(II)&#8208;catalyzed picolinamide&#8208;directed annulation of alkyne via C(sp2)&#8722;H bond activation was developed. Under the optimized reaction condition, the reaction system shows a wide scope of alkynes and obtains the novel annulation acyl&#8208;substituted 1H&#8208;benzoquinoline in good to excellent yields (up to 96&#8201;%).







Abstract
A cobalt(II)&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] annulation of picolinamides with alkynes via C&#8722;H bond activation has been developed. The operationally simple annulation reaction allows for the synthesis of acyl&#8208;substituted 1H&#8208;benzoquinoline bearing multiple aromatic rings (up to 96&#8201;% yield) without co&#8208;oxidant or other oxidation factors under mild conditions. Several control experiments were carried out. This practical [4+2] annulation provides an efficient route to access highly functionalized compounds.

      <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Click Chemistry for Highly Regioselective Azide&#8211;Alkyne Cycloaddition by a Photoredox Electron&#8208;Transfer Strategy</title>
      <dc:description>
One more click! A novel design strategy for the azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition reaction by visible&#8208;light catalysis through a photoredox electron&#8208;transfer process (see scheme) has been developed for the first time. The reaction can be performed with a metal&#8208;free catalyst in water using solar energy, making this a sustainable and environmentally friendly photocatalytic system, and represents an important development for click chemistry.







Abstract
Click chemistry focuses on the development of highly selective reactions using simple precursors for the exquisite synthesis of molecules. Undisputedly, the CuI&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) is one of the most valuable examples of click chemistry, but it suffers from some limitations as it requires additional reducing agents and ligands as well as cytotoxic copper. Here, we demonstrate a novel strategy for the azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition reaction that involves a photoredox electron&#8208;transfer radical mechanism instead of the traditional metal&#8208;catalyzed coordination process. This newly developed photocatalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition reaction can be performed under mild conditions at room temperature in the presence of air and visible light and shows good functional group tolerance, excellent atom economy, high yields of up to 99&#8201;%, and absolute regioselectivity, affording a variety of 1,4&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazole derivatives, including bioactive molecules and pharmaceuticals. The use of a recyclable photocatalyst, solar energy, and water as solvent makes this photocatalytic system sustainable and environmentally friendly. Moreover, the azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition reaction could be photocatalyzed in the presence of a metal&#8208;free catalyst with excellent regioselectivity, which represents an important development for click chemistry and should find versatile applications in organic synthesis, chemical biology, and materials science.

     alt="Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Click Chemistry for Highly Regioselective Azide&#8211;Alkyne Cycloaddition by a Photoredox Electron&#8208;Transfer Strategy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;One more click&lt;/b&gt;! A novel design strategy for the azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition reaction by visible&#8208;light catalysis through a photoredox electron&#8208;transfer process (see scheme) has been developed for the first time. The reaction can be performed with a metal&#8208;free catalyst in water using solar energy, making this a sustainable and environmentally friendly photocatalytic system, and represents an important development for click chemistry.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click chemistry focuses on the development of highly selective reactions using simple precursors for the exquisite synthesis of molecules. Undisputedly, the Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) is one of the most valuable examples of click chemistry, but it suffers from some limitations as it requires additional reducing agents and ligands as well as cytotoxic copper. Here, we demonstrate a novel strategy for the azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition reaction that involves a photoredox electron&#8208;transfer radical mechanism instead of the traditional metal&#8208;catalyzed coordination process. This newly developed photocatalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition reaction can be performed under mild conditions at room temperature in the presence of air and visible light and shows good functional group tolerance, excellent atom economy, high yields of up to 99&#8201;%, and absolute regioselectivity, affording a variety of 1,4&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazole derivatives, including bioactive molecules and pharmaceuticals. The use of a recyclable photocatalyst, solar energy, and water as solvent makes this photocatalytic system sustainable and environmentally friendly. Moreover, the azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition reaction could be photocatalyzed in the presence of a metal&#8208;free catalyst with excellent regioselectivity, which represents an important development for click chemistry and should find versatile applications in organic synthesis, chemical biology, and materials science.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Salinomycin Derivatives Kill Breast Cancer Stem Cells by Lysosomal Iron Targeting</title>
      <dc:description>
Library of salinomycin derivatives: The search for new candidates to tackle the cancer stem cells (CSC) niche has led to the synthesis of a library of salinomycin derivatives. This study demonstrates that the stereoselective reductive amination at C20 is a key modification for selective targeting of breast CSC. The new C20&#8208;cyclopropylamine derivative exhibited an impressive nanomolar activity against CSC, killing these cells by ROS production, induced after iron accumulation in lysosomes.







Abstract
Salinomycin (1) exhibits a large spectrum of biological activities including the capacity to selectively eradicate cancer stem cells (CSC), making it and its derivatives promising candidates for the development of drug leads against CSC. It has been previously shown that salinomycin and its C20&#8208;propargylamine derivative (Ironomycin (2)) accumulate in lysosomes and sequester iron in this organelle. Herein, a library of salinomycin derivatives is reported, including products of C20&#8208;amination, C1&#8208;esterification, C9&#8208;oxidation, and C28&#8208;dehydration. The biological activity of these compounds is evaluated against transformed human mammary epithelial HMLER CD24low/CD44high cells, a well&#8208;established model of breast CSC, and HMLER CD24high/CD44low cells deprived of CSC properties. Unlike other structural alterations, derivative 4, which displays a cyclopropylamine at position C20, showed a strikingly low IC50 value of 23&#8197;nm against HMLER CD24low/CD44high cells. This study provides highly selective molecules to target the CSC niche, a potential interesting advance for drug development to prevent cancer resistance.

      <title>Non&#8208;emissive Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes as efficient and selective photosensitizers for the photooxidation of benzylamines</title>

      <title>Chameleonic Behavior of the &#945;&#8208;Methylcyclopropyl Group and Its Through&#8208;Space Interactions: A Route to Stabilized Three Redox States in Diarylnitroxides</title>
      <dc:description>
Redox chameleons: First examples of nitroxide radicals containing &#945;&#8208;methylcyclopropyl (MCP) groups have been synthesized. Different orientations of the &#8220;chameleonic&#8221; MCP substituent relative to the phenyl ring are dependent on the redox state of the system, and through&#8208;space hyperconjugative interactions provide enhanced stability of the radical, cationic, and anionic forms and open the possibility of the new nitroxides to be used as ambipolar redox&#8208;active materials.







Abstract
The &#945;&#8208;methylcyclopropyl (MCP) group with conformationally dependent electronic properties is suggested as an additional structural &#8220;instrument&#8221; for stabilization of both open&#8208;shell and ionic states of diarylnitroxides, to be used as &#8220;ambipolar&#8221; redox active materials. New MCP&#8208;substituted diphenylnitroxides (fully characterized by electrochemical, spectral, and X&#8208;ray data) are the most stable nitroxides of the diaryl type known to date [&#964;1/2 in benzene exceeds three months (2310&#8197;h)]. The radicals are capable to reversible oxidation and reduction, yielding stable oxoammonium cations and aminoxyl anions. DFT investigation of the electronic structure and geometry of the compounds confirmed the conformational switching of the cyclopropyl orientation relative to the adjacent aromatic &#960; system is dependent on the nitroxide's redox state. Additional through&#8208;space stabilizing interaction between the &#960;&#8208;acceptor orbital of the NO+ moiety and the cyclopropyl &#8220;banana&#8221; bond orbital was also detected, highlighting its good hyperconjugative ability. The estimated &#963;(para)MCP value (&#8722;0.32) confirms its strong electron&#8208;donating properties.

Abstract
In this work, the ternary hybrid structure VSe2/SWCNTs/rGO is reported for supercapacitor applications. The ternary composite exhibits a high specific capacitance of 450&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 in a symmetric cell configuration, with maximum energy density of 131.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and power density of 27.49&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1. The ternary hybrid also shows a cyclic stability of 91&#8201;% after 5000&#8197;cycles. Extensive density functional theory (DFT) simulations on the structure as well as on the electronic properties of the binary hybrid structure VSe2/SWCNTs and the ternary hybrid structure VSe2/SWCNTs/rGO have been carried out. Due to a synergic effect, there are enhanced density of states near the Fermi level and higher quantum capacitance for the hybrid ternary structure compared to VSe2/SWCNTs, leading to higher energy and power density for VSe2/SWCNTs/rGO, supporting our experimental observation. Computed diffusion energy barrier of electrolyte ions (K+) predicts that ions move faster in the ternary structure, providing higher charge storage performance.

The ternary composite exhibits a high specific capacitance of 450&#8197;F&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in a symmetric cell configuration, with maximum energy density of 131.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and power density of 27.49&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The ternary hybrid also shows a cyclic stability of 91&#8201;% after 5000&#8197;cycles. Extensive density functional theory (DFT) simulations on the structure as well as on the electronic properties of the binary hybrid structure VSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/SWCNTs and the ternary hybrid structure VSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/SWCNTs/rGO have been carried out. Due to a synergic effect, there are enhanced density of states near the Fermi level and higher quantum capacitance for the hybrid ternary structure compared to VSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/SWCNTs, leading to higher energy and power density for VSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/SWCNTs/rGO, supporting our experimental observation. Computed diffusion energy barrier of electrolyte ions (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) predicts that ions move faster in the ternary structure, providing higher charge storage performance.&lt;/p&gt;

Artificial protein mimics: The self&#8208;assembly of five peptide coiled&#8208;coil motifs was templated by the hybridization of a d&#8208;DNA triplex or its mirror&#8208;image counterpart, an l&#8208;DNA triplex.

Abstract
DNA nanostructures have been designed and used in many different applications. However, the use of nucleic acid scaffolds to promote the self&#8208;assembly of artificial protein mimics is only starting to emerge. Herein five coiled&#8208;coil peptide structures were templated by the hybridization of a d&#8208;DNA triplex or its mirror&#8208;image counterpart, an l&#8208;DNA triplex. The self&#8208;assembly of the desired trimeric structures in solution was confirmed by gel electrophoresis and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, and the stabilizing synergy between the two domains was found to be chirality&#8208;independent but orientation&#8208;dependent. This is the first example of using a nucleic acid scaffold of l&#8208;DNA to template the formation of artificial protein mimics. The results may advance the emerging POC&#8208;based nanotechnology field by adding two extra dimensions, that is, chirality and polarity, to provide innovative molecular tools for rational design and bottom&#8208;up construction of artificial protein mimics, programmable materials and responsive nanodevices.

      <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed ortho&#8208;Bromination of O&#8208;Phenyl Carbamates Accelerated by a Secondary Amide&#8208;Pendant Cyclopentadienyl Ligand</title>
      <dc:description>
A newly developed cyclopentadienyl rhodium(III) [CpARhIII] complex, bearing an acidic secondary amide moiety on the Cp ring, is able to catalyze the ortho&#8208;bromination of O&#8208;phenyl carbamates with NBS at room temperature. The presence of the acidic secondary amide moiety on the CpA ligand accelerates bromination by the hydrogen bond between the acidic NH group of the CpA ligand and the carbonyl group of NBS. This cover feature illustrates the activation of NBS by the above hydrogen bond. The background forest is inspired by the green chemistry aspect of this reaction.

      <title>Enhanced NiO dispersion on a high surface pillared heterostructure covered by niobium leads to an optimal behavior in the ODH of ethane</title>
      <dc:description>Nb&#8208;containing siliceous porous clay heterostructure (PCH) (Nb&#8208;content from 0 to 30 wt%), prepared from a bentonite, has been used as effective support in the preparation of supported NiO catalysts (with NiO loading from 15 to 80 wt%).

      <title>Precursor Design Strategies for the Low&#8208;Temperature Synthesis of Functional Oxides: It's All in the Chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>
Overview of the different explored low&#8208;temperature strategies increasing the energy efficiency for functional oxide synthesis, taking into account the application of green precursors and atom economy considerations.







Abstract
Solution&#8208;based (multi)metal oxide synthesis has been carried out employing a large diversity of precursor routes. The selection of an appropriate synthesis strategy is frequently dictated by the resulting material properties, although this choice should also be based on green chemistry principles, atom economy considerations and energy efficiency. In order to limit the required energy budget to convert the chemical precursor to the target oxide material, various approaches were recently reported. This Review summarizes some frequently encountered low&#8208;temperature routes, critically assessing their application window and advantages. More specifically, auto&#8208;combustion synthesis, UV&#8208;assisted decomposition routes, sol&#8211;gel network adjustments and precursor complex design concepts are discussed. It is expected that this toolbox of low&#8208;temperature strategies may assist further progress in the field, stimulating novel applications, such as flexible electronics or organic&#8211;oxide hybrid materials, which are very sensitive to the temperature requirements.

Makes it faster! It has been established that a newly developed cyclopentadienyl rhodium(III) [CpARhIII] complex, bearing an acidic secondary amide moiety on the Cp ring, is able to catalyze the ortho&#8208;bromination of O&#8208;phenyl carbamates with NBS at room temperature.

      <title>A General Approach to Enzyme&#8208;Responsive Liposomes</title>
      <dc:description>Liposomes are effective nanocarriers due to their ability to deliver encapsulated drugs to diseased cells. Nevertheless, liposome delivery would be improved by enhancing the ability to control the release of contents at the target site. While various stimuli have been explored for triggering liposome release, enzymes provide excellent targets due to their common overexpression in diseased cells. We present a general approach to enzyme&#8208;responsive liposomes exploiting targets that are commonly aberrant in disease, including esterases, phosphatases and &#946;&#8208;galactosidases. Responsive lipids correlating with each enzyme family were designed and synthesized bearing an enzyme substrate moiety attached via a self&#8208;immolating linker to a non&#8208;bilayer lipid scaffold, such that enzymatic hydrolysis triggers lipid decomposition to disrupt membrane integrity and release contents. Liposome dye leakage assays demonstrated that each enzyme&#8208;responsive lipid yielded significant content release upon enzymatic treatment compared to minimal release in controls. Results also showed that fine&#8208;tuning liposome composition was critical for controlling release. DLS analysis showed particle size increases in the cases of esterase&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;galactosidase&#8208;responsive lipids, supporting alterations to membrane properties. These results showcase an effective modular strategy that can be tailored to target different enzymes, providing a promising new avenue for advancing liposomal drug delivery.</dc:description>

      <title>Highly efficient luminescent solar concentrators based on benzoheterodiazole dyes with large Stokes&#8217; shifts</title>
      <dc:description>Five extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems with electron donor (D) and acceptor (A) moieties have been synthesized. Their basic D&#8208;A&#8208;D structural motif is a benzothiadiazole unit symmetrically equipped with two thiophene rings (  S2T  ). Its variants include (i) the same molecular framework where sulfur is replaced by selenium (  Se2T  ), also with four thiophene units (  Se4T  ) and (ii) a D&#8217;&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8208;D system having a N&#8208;carbazole donor moiety at one end (  CS2T  ) and a D&#8217;&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8217; array with a further acceptor carbonyl unit at the other extremity (  CS2TCHO  ). The goal is taking advantage of the intense luminescence and large Stokes&#8217; shifts of the five molecules for use in luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs). All of them exhibit intense absorption spectra in the UV&#8208;VIS region down to 630 nm, which are fully rationalized by DFT. Emission properties have been studied in CH  2  Cl  2  (298 and 77 K) as well as in PMMA and PDMS matrices, measuring photoluminescence quantum yields (up to 98%) and other key optical parameters. The dye&#8208;PMMA systems show performances comparable to the present state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, in terms of optical and external quantum efficiencies (OQE = 47.6% and EQE = 31.3%, respectively) and flux gain (F = 10.3), with geometric gain close to 90.

      <title>Tailoring Magnetic Feature in Zigzag&#8208;Edged Nanographenes via Controlled Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>Nanographenes (NGs) with tunable electronic and magnetic properties have attracted enormous attention in the realm of carbon&#8208;based nanoelectronics. In particular, NGs with biradical character at the ground state are promising building units for molecular spintronics. However, most of the biradicaloids are susceptible to oxidation under ambient conditions and photolytic degradation, which hamper their further applications. Here, we demonstrated the feasibility of tuning the magnetic properties of zigzag&#8208;edged NGs in order to enhance their stability via the controlled Diels&#8208;Alder reactions of  peri  &#8208;tetracene (  4&#8208;PA  ). The unstable  4&#8208;PA  (  y  0  = 0.72; half&#8208;life,  t  1/2  = 3 h) was transformed into the unprecedented benzo&#8208;peri&#8208;tetracenes (  BPTs  ) by one&#8208;side Diels&#8208;Alder reaction, which is featured a biradical character at the ground state (  y  0  = 0.60) and exhibits remarkable stability under ambient conditions for several months. In addition, the fully zigzag&#8208;edged circumanthracenes (  CAs  ) were achieved by two&#8208;fold or step&#8208;wise Diels&#8208;Alder reactions of  4&#8208;PA  , in which the magnetic property could be controlled by employing the corresponding dienophiles. Our work reported herein opens avenues for the synthesis of novel zigzag&#8208;edged NGs with tailor&#8208;made magnetic properties.</dc:description>

In particular, NGs with biradical character at the ground state are promising building units for molecular spintronics. However, most of the biradicaloids are susceptible to oxidation under ambient conditions and photolytic degradation, which hamper their further applications. Here, we demonstrated the feasibility of tuning the magnetic properties of zigzag&#8208;edged NGs in order to enhance their stability via the controlled Diels&#8208;Alder reactions of  peri  &#8208;tetracene (  4&#8208;PA  ). The unstable  4&#8208;PA  (  y  0  = 0.72; half&#8208;life,  t  1/2  = 3 h) was transformed into the unprecedented benzo&#8208;peri&#8208;tetracenes (  BPTs  ) by one&#8208;side Diels&#8208;Alder reaction, which is featured a biradical character at the ground state (  y  0  = 0.60) and exhibits remarkable stability under ambient conditions for several months. In addition, the fully zigzag&#8208;edged circumanthracenes (  CAs  ) were achieved by two&#8208;fold or step&#8208;wise Diels&#8208;Alder reactions of  4&#8208;PA  , in which the magnetic property could be controlled by employing the corresponding dienophiles. Our work reported herein opens avenues for the synthesis of novel zigzag&#8208;edged NGs with tailor&#8208;made magnetic properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Chemical bonding in colossal thermopower FeSb2</title>
      <dc:description>FeSb2 exhibits a colossal Seebeck coefficient ( ) and a record breaking high thermoelectric power factor. It also has an atypical shift from diamagnetism to paramagnetism with increasing temperature, and the fine details of its electron correlation effects have been widely discussed. The extraordinary physical properties must be rooted in the nature of the chemical bonding, and indeed the chemical bonding in this archetypical marcasite structure has been heavily debated on a theoretical basis since the 1960&#8217;s. The two prevalent models for describing the bonding interactions in FeSb2 are either based on ligand&#8208;field stabilisation of Fe or a network structure of Sb hosting Fe&#8208;ions. However, neither model can account for the observed properties of FeSb2. Here we report an experimental electron density study based on analysis of synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction data measured at 15 K on a minute single crystal to limit systematic errors. The analysis is supplemented with Density Functional Theory calculations in the experimental geometry. The experimental data are at variance with both the additional single&#8208;electron Sb&#8208;Sb bond implied by the covalent model, and the large formal charge and expected &#8208;orbital splitting advocated by the ionic model. The structure is best described as an extended covalent network in agreement with expectations based on electronegativity differences.</dc:description>

      <title>Experimental and Theoretical Evidence of Spin&#8208;Orbit Heavy Atom on the Light Atom 1H NMR Chemical Shifts Induced through H&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;I&#8211; Hydrogen Bond</title>
      <dc:description>Spin&#8208;orbit (SO) heavy&#8208;atom on the light&#8208;atom (SO&#8208;HALA) effect is the largest relativistic effect caused by a heavy atom on its light&#8208;atom neighbors, leading, e.g. to unexpected NMR chemical shifts of 1H, 13C, and 15N nuclei, when bonded to a HA. In this study, a combined experimental and theoretical evidence for the SO&#8208;HALA effect transmitted through hydrogen bond is presented. Solid&#8208;state NMR data for a series of 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine salts containing I&#8211;, Br&#8211; and Cl&#8211; counter ions were obtained experimentally and by theoretical calculations. A comparison of the experimental chemical shifts with those calculated by a standard DFT methodology without the SO contribution to the chemical shifts revealed a remarkable error of the calculated proton chemical shift of a hydrogen atom that is in close contact with the iodide anion. The addition of the relativistic SO correction in the calculations significantly improves overall agreement with the experiment and confirms the propagation of the SO&#8208;HALA effect through hydrogen bond.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Hydrogen borrowing catalysis represents a powerful method for the alkylation of amine or enolate nucleophiles with unactivated alcohols. This approach relies upon a catalyst which can mediate a strategic series of redox events, enabling the formation of C&#8211;C and C&#8211;N bonds and producing water as the sole by&#8208;product.

The linear benzorhodamine derivatives provide bright fluorescence images in cell as well as in tissue.

      <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Boron Complexes with a Carbazoyl Schiff Base</title>
      <dc:description>A variety of carbazolyl&#8208;appended Schiff bases were readily synthesized from 1&#8208;formylcarbazoles and aniline derivatives. Boron complexation of the resulting ligands allowed facile preparations of new carbazole&#8208;based BODIPY analogues showing solid&#8208;state fluorescence. Furthermore, some dyes were converted into chiral compounds through the Et  2  AlCl&#8208;mediated incorporation of a binaphthyl unit.

      <title>Better Together: Functional Heterobimetallic Macrocyclic and Cage&#8208;like Assemblies</title>
      <dc:description>Metallosupramolecular chemistry has attracted the interest of generations of researches due to the versatile properties and functionalities of oligonuclear coordination complexes. Quite a number of different discrete cages were investigated, mostly consi&#8208;sting of only one type of ligand and one type of metal cation. Looking for ever more complex structures, heterobimetallic complexes became more and more attractive, as they give access to new structural motifs and functions. In the last years substantial success has been made in the design and synthesis of cages consisting of more than one type of metal cations, and a rapidly growing number of functional materials has appeared in the literature. This minireview describes recent developments in the field of discrete heterometallic macrocycles and cages focusing on functional materials that have been used as host&#8208;systems or as magnetic, photo&#8208;active, redox&#8208;active, and even catalytically active materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Rhodium Nanoparticles as a Novel Photosensitizing Agent in Photodynamic Therapy against Cancer</title>
      <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy is a promising alternative treatment for different types of cancer due to its high selectivity, which prevents healthy tissues from being damaged. The use of nanomaterials in photodynamic therapy has several advantages over classical photosensitizing agents, due to their unique properties and their ability to be functionalized. Especially interesting is the use of metallic nanoparticles, capable of absorbing electromagnetic radiation to either transfer this energy to oxygen molecules for the generation of ROS or dissipate it as heat. Although previous reports have demonstrated the capacity of Rh derivatives as anti&#8208;tumour drugs, there are no studies on the potential of small&#8208;sized Rh nanoparticles as photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy. In this study, 5 nm Rh nanoparticles has been synthesized and their potential in photodynamic therapy has been evaluated. The results have shown that treatment with Rh nanoparticles followed by NIR irradiation induces apoptosis in cancer cells through a p53&#8208;independent mechanism.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Electroactive organic molecules have received a lot of attention in the field of electronics because of their fascinating electronic properties, easy functionalization and potential low cost towards their implementation in electronic devices. In recent years, electroactive organic molecules have also emerged as promising building blocks for the design and construction of crystalline porous frameworks such as Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) and Covalent&#8208;Organic Frameworks (COFs) for application in electronics. Such porous materials present certain additional advantages such as, for example, an immense structural and functional versatility, combination of porosity with multiple electronic properties and the possibility of tuning their physical properties by post&#8208;synthetic modifications. In this review, we summarize the main electroactive organic building blocks used in the past few years for the design and construction of functional porous materials (MOFs &amp; COFs) for electronics with special emphasis on their electronic structure and functionality relationships. The different building blocks have been classified based on the electronic nature and main function of the resulting porous frameworks.

      <title>Mechanism and Origin of MAD&#8208;Induced Ni/N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective C&#8722;H Cyclization of Pyridines with Alkenes</title>
      <dc:description>
DFT calculations show a new mechanism, in which a unique H&#8208;migration assisted oxidation metalation (HMAOM) step is identified as the rate&#8208; and enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step. The newly proposed mechanism can well rationalize the regio&#8208; and enantioselective C&#8722;H cyclization of pyridines with alkenes and also unveil the reasons that the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand and the MAD additive can facilitate the reaction (see figure).







Abstract
This work presents a DFT&#8208;based computational study on the regio&#8208; and enantioselective C&#8722;H functionalization of pyridines with alkenes at the relatively unreactive C4&#8208;position, which was successfully achieved by Shi et&#8197;al. [J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2019, 141, 5628&#8211;5634] using Ni0/N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis under the assistance of an aluminum&#8208;based Lewis acid additive (2,6&#8208;tBu2&#8208;4&#8208;Me&#8208;C6H2O)2AlMe (MAD). The calculations indicate that the selective functionalization involves a three&#8208;step mechanism in which a unique H&#8208;migration assisted oxidation metalation (HMAOM) step is identified as the rate&#8208; and enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step. The newly proposed mechanism can well rationalize the experimental observation that the preferred product is the endo&#8208;type (vs. exo&#8208;type), R&#8208;configuration (vs. S&#8208;configuration) product at the C4 (vs. C2) position, and also unveil the reasons that the NHC ligand and the MAD additive can facilitate the reaction.

      <title>Stability, Structure and Reconstruction of 1H&#8208;Edges in MoS2</title>
      <dc:description>
A complete density functional study of S&#8208;terminated edges in 1H&#8208;MoS2 finds new potential entropically favored structures for Mo&#8208;100&#8201;%S edges, and proposes a Peierls&#8217; distortion model explaining the stability of triply periodic Mo&#8208;50&#8201;%S edges.







Abstract
Density functional studies of the edges of single&#8208;layer 1H&#8208;MoS2 are presented. This phase presents a rich variability of edges that can influence the morphology and properties of MoS2 nano&#8208;objects, play an important role in industrial chemical processes, and find future applications in energy storage, electronics and spintronics. The so&#8208;called Mo&#8208;100&#8201;%S edges vertical S&#8208;dimers were confirmed to be stable, however the authors also identified a family of metastable edges combining Mo atoms linked by two&#8208;electron donor symmetrical disulfide ligands and four&#8208;electron donor unsymmetrical disulfide ligands. These may be entropically favored, potentially stabilizing them at high temperatures as a &#8220;liquid edge&#8221; phase. For Mo&#8208;50&#8201;%S edges, S&#8208;bridge structures with 3&#215; periodicity along the edge are the most stable, compatible with a Peierls&#8217; distortion arising from the d&#8208;bands of the edge Mo atoms. An additional explanation for this periodicity is proposed through the formation of 3&#8208;center bonds.

      <title>Exploring the Biocatalytic Potential of Fe/&#945;&#8208;Ketoglutarate&#8208;Dependent Halogenases</title>
      <dc:description>
Fe/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate halogenases are turning into valuable tools for the stereoselective incorporation of halogen atoms into unactivated C&#8722;H bonds. To date, halogenases which selectively derivatize free amino acids or indole alkaloids have been discovered. While first enzyme engineering examples highlight that the substrate scope can be expanded, structural and biochemical characterizations continue to inform about the enzymes&#8217; catalytic mechanism.







Abstract
Freestanding Fe/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent halogenases are oxidoreductases that catalyze the installation of halogen atoms into unactivated sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon centers with high stereo&#8208; and regioselectivity. Since their discovery in 2014, a small number of indole alkaloid and amino acid halogenases have been identified and characterized. First enzyme engineering examples suggest that the accessible substrate range of these enzymes may be expanded through the use of rational enzyme design and directed evolution. Structural investigations of non&#8208;heme iron halogenases acting on freestanding as well as tethered substrates are beginning to inform about the principles of the underlying halogenation mechanism.

      <title>Photoredox&#8208;Mediated Reaction of gem&#8208;Diborylalkenes: Reactivity Toward Diverse 1,1&#8208;Bisborylalkanes</title>
      <dc:description>
Radical chemistry! The use of gem&#8208;bis&#8208;metalated&#8208;alkenes, that is, vinyl gem&#8208;diboron&#8208;compounds, as radical&#8208;labile substrates is explored. The knowledge gained provided an in&#8208;depth understanding of the reactivity of the radical intermediates of geminal&#8208;metalated ethane. This methodology can serve as the late&#8208;stage diversification of bioactive molecules and simple organic molecules in which it drives the synthesis of gem&#8208;diborylalkanes (see scheme).







Abstract
The use of gem&#8208;diborylalkenes as radical&#8208;reactive groups is explored for the first time. These reactions provide an efficient and general method for the photochemical conversion of gem&#8208;diborylalkenes to rapidly access 1,1&#8208;bisborylalkanes. This method exploits a novel photoredox decarboxylative radical addition to gem&#8208;diborylalkenes to afford &#945;&#8208;gem&#8208;diboryl carbon&#8208;centered radicals, which benefit from additional stability by virtue of an interaction with the empty p&#8208;orbitals on borons. The reaction offers a highly modular and regioselective approach to &#947;&#8208;amino gem&#8208;diborylalkanes. Furthermore, EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations have provided insight into the radical mechanism underlying the photochemistry reaction and the stability of the bis&#8208;metalated radicals, respectively.

      <title>C&#8722;F Arylation of Polyfluorophenols by Means of Sigmatropic Dearomatization/Defluorination Sequence</title>
      <dc:description>
Selective C&#8722;F arylation of polyfluorophenols with aryl sulfoxides has been accomplished by means of a sigmatropic dearomatization/defluorination sequence: interrupted Pummerer reaction, [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement with dearomatization, and Zn&#8208;mediated defluorinative rearomatization. The utility of the strategy is demonstrated by the synthesis of a fluorinated analogue of Maxipost (see scheme).







Abstract
Selective C&#8722;F arylation of polyfluorophenols with aryl sulfoxides has been accomplished by means of a sigmatropic dearomatization/defluorination sequence. This sequence consists of three processes: 1)&#8197;interrupted Pummerer reaction to form S&#8722;O&#8208;tethered sulfonium salt; 2)&#8197;C&#8722;C&#8208;forming [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement with dearomatization; and 3)&#8197;Zn&#8208;mediated defluorinative rearomatization. The present biaryl construction provides a facile access to polyfluorinated biaryls that is difficult to synthesize by other methods. The synthetic utility of the strategy is clearly demonstrated by the synthesis of a fluorinated analogue of Maxipost, a potassium channel modulator.

      <title>Optoelectronic Properties of Carbon&#8208;Bound Boron Difluoride Hydrazone Dimers</title>
      <dc:description>
Boron difluoride hydrazone dimers exhibit structurally tunable and sometimes unexpected absorption, emission, and electrochemical properties. These findings are rationalized using DFT calculations and X&#8208;ray crystallography experiments (see figure).







Abstract
The creation of dimeric boron difluoride complexes of chelating N&#8208;donor ligands is a proven strategy for the enhancement of the optoelectronic properties of fluorescent dyes. We report dimers based on the boron difluoride hydrazone (BODIHY) framework, which offer unique and sometimes unexpected substituent&#8208;dependent absorption, emission, and electrochemical properties. BODIHY dimers have low&#8208;energy absorption bands (&#955;max=421 to 479&#8197;nm, &#1013;=17&#8201;200 to 39&#8201;900&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1) that are red&#8208;shifted relative to monomeric analogues. THF solutions of these dimers exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced emission upon addition of water, with emission enhancement factors ranging from 5 to 18. Thin films of BODIHY dimers are weakly emissive as a result of the inner&#8208;filter effect, attributed to intermolecular &#960;&#8208;type interactions. BODIHY dimers are redox&#8208;active and display two one&#8208;electron oxidation and two one&#8208;electron reduction waves that strongly depend on the N&#8208;aryl substituents. These properties are rationalized using density&#8208;functional theory calculations and X&#8208;ray crystallography experiments.

      <title>Synthesis of 3D IrRuMn Sphere as a Superior Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalyst in Acidic Environment</title>
      <dc:description>
Spherical electrocatalyst: A spherical IrRuMn catalyst is synthesized through a wet chemical approach. This catalyst exhibits exceptional performance for the OER, with an overpotential of 260&#8197;mV at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in strongly acidic media.







Abstract
The design of a three&#8208;dimensional structure for an Ir&#8208;based catalyst offers a great opportunity to improve the electrocatalytic performance and maximize the use of the precious metal. Herein, a novel wet chemical strategy is reported for the synthesis of an IrRuMn catalyst with a sphere structure and porous features. In the synthetic process, the combined use of citric acid and formamide is requisite for the formation of the sphere structure. This method leads to a favorable 3D IrRuMn sphere structure with many fully exposed active sites. Furthermore, an alloying noble metal, such as Ir or Ru, with the transition metal leads to enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The doping of a transition metal, such as Mn, is an interesting example, because it exhibits stability and activity in both acidic and alkaline media. For the OER, the IrRuMn sphere catalyst exhibits an overpotential of 260&#8197;mV at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in strongly acidic 0.1&#8201;m HClO4, which is superior to that of a commercial IrO2/C catalyst. This approach provides a novel way to synthesize an Ir&#8208;based multimetallic spherical electrocatalyst, which exhibits exceptional efficiency for the acidic OER. It will pave the way for new approaches to the practical utilization of PEM electrolyzers.

      <title>FeIII&#8211;Salen&#8208;Based Probes for the Selective and Sensitive Detection of E450 in Foodstuff</title>
      <dc:description>
Selective brightness: A selective FeIII&#8211;salen&#8208;based probe that fluorometrically detects pyrophosphate (alias E450) in baking powder by a disassembly approach is described.







Abstract
Inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) is considered as a diagnostic marker for various diseases such as cancer and vascular calcification. PPi also plays an important preservative role as an additive E450 in foodstuff. In this work, a selective FeIII&#8211;salen&#8208;based probe for PPi is described; this probe disassembles in the presence of the target analyte into its molecular blocks, 1,2&#8208;propanediamine and 3&#8208;chloro&#8208;5&#8208;formyl&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid. The latter signaling unit leads to a fluorometric response. Compared with a related prototype, the new complex shows a 2.3&#8208;times stronger emission at 500&#8197;nm and a 155&#8208;times better selectivity of PPi over adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Importantly, the new probe was successfully applied for detecting E450 in foodstuff.

      <title>Samarium(II) Monoalkyl Complex Supported by a &#946;&#8208;Diketiminato&#8208;Based Tetradentate Ligand: Synthesis, Structure, and Catalytic Hydrosilylation of Internal Alkynes</title>
      <dc:description>
A five&#8208;coordinate samarium(II) monoalkyl complex is synthesized and structurally characterized. This complex shows high catalytic activity and high stereo&#8208; and regioselectivity in the hydrosilylation of various aryl and methyl&#8208;substituted unsymmetrical internal alkynes with secondary hydrosilanes under mild conditions (see scheme).







Abstract
The synthesis and catalytic applications of trivalent rare&#8208;earth metal alkyl complexes have been well developed, but the chemistry of divalent rare&#8208;earth metal alkyl complexes lagged much behind. Herein, we report the synthesis, structure, and catalytic applications of a samarium(II) monoalkyl complex supported by a &#946;&#8208;diketiminato&#8208;based tetradentate ligand, [LSmCH(SiMe3)2] (L=[MeC(NDipp)CHC(Me)NCH2CH2N(Me)CH2CH2NMe2]&#8722;, Dipp=2,6&#8208;(iPr)2C6H3). This complex is synthesized by the salt metathesis reaction of samarium iodide [LSm(&#956;&#8208;I)]2 and KCH(SiMe3)2 in 63&#8201;% yield. Its structure is characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, showing a distorted square&#8208;pyramid coordination geometry. This samarium(II) monoalkyl complex exhibits high catalytic activity in the hydrosilylation of aryl and methyl&#8208;substituted unsymmetrical internal alkynes with secondary hydrosilanes, selectively providing the &#945;&#8208;(E) products in high yields.

      <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional MOF and COF Nanosheets: Synthesis and Applications in Electrochemistry</title>
      <dc:description>
Materials for electrochemistry: Metal&#8211;organic framework and covalent organic framework nanosheets represent one promising kind of power materials for electrochemical. Synthesis strategies, tailored material properties and different electrochemical performances are prominent features of supercapacitors, batteries, OER and HER. Metal&#8211;organic framework and covalent organic framework nanosheets comprehensively summarized and evaluations are given in this Review.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) and covalent organic framework (COF) nanosheets are a new type of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials with unique design principles and various synthesis methods. They are considered ideal electrochemical devices due to the ultrathin thickness, easily tunable molecular structure, large porosity and other unique properties. There are two common methods to synthesize 2D MOF/COF nanosheets: bottom&#8208;up and top&#8208;down. The top&#8208;down strategy mainly includes ultrasonic assisted exfoliation, electrochemical exfoliation and mechanical exfoliation. Another strategy mainly includes interface synthesis, modulation synthesis, surfactant&#8208;assisted synthesis. In this Review, the development of ultrathin 2D nanosheets in the field of electrochemistry (supercapacitors, batteries, oxygen reduction, and hydrogen evolution) is introduced, and their unique dimensional advantages are highlighted.

      <title>Asymmetric Organocatalyzed Aza&#8208;Henry Reaction of Hydrazones: Experimental and Computational Studies</title>
      <dc:description>
A new protocol: The first asymmetric catalyzed aza&#8208;Henry reaction of hydrazones is presented. In this process, quinine was used as the catalyst to synthesize a variety of alkyl substituted &#946;&#8208;nitrohydrazides with up to 94&#8201;%&#8197;ee. Additionally, experimental and ab initio studies were performed to understand the reaction mechanism. The results revealed a concerted mode of activation in which a C&#8722;C bond forming reaction and a protonation occur simultaneously.

The first asymmetric catalyzed aza&#8208;Henry reaction of hydrazones is presented. In this process, quinine was used as the catalyst to synthesize different alkyl substituted &#946;&#8208;nitrohydrazides with ee up to 77&#8201;%. This ee was improved up to 94&#8201;% by a further recrystallization and the opposite enantiomer can be obtained by using quinidine as the catalyst, opening exciting possibilities in fields in which the control of chirality is vital, such as the pharmaceutical industry. Additionally, experimental and ab initio studies were performed to understand the reaction mechanism. The experimental results revealed an unexpected secondary kinetic isotope effect (KIE) that is explained by the calculated reaction pathway, which shows that the protonation of the initial hydrazone and the C&#8722;C bond forming reaction occur during a concerted process. This concerted mechanism makes the catalysis conceptually different to traditional base&#8208;promoted Henry and aza&#8208;Henry reactions.

      <dc:description>
C&#8722;P bond formation: By taking advantage of a PCET&#8208;triggered radical relay process, a new general method to versatile valuable functionalized gem&#8208;bisphosphonates is described (see scheme).







Abstract
Herein we report a novel and straightforward protocol for the construction of valuable gem&#8208;BPs by means of proton&#8208;coupled electron&#8208;transfer (PCET)&#8208;triggered enamido C(sp2)&#8722;H diphosphorylation. This reaction represents a rare example of realizing the challenging double C&#8722;P bond formation at a single carbon atom, thus providing facile access to a broad variety of structurally diverse bisphosphonates from simple enamides under silver&#8208;mediated conditions. Initial mechanistic studies demonstrated that the diphosphorylation involves two rounds of PCET&#8208;initiated radical relay process.

      <title>Supramolecular Regulation of Polydopamine Formation by Amyloid Fibers</title>
      <dc:description>
Roped together: Inspired by melanin biosynthesis process, amyloid fibers were used to regulate polydopamine formation. The presence of amyloid fibers accelerated polydopamine formation, and the resultant polydopamine&#8211;amyloid composites exhibited different materials properties to those of polydopamine. Amyloids made of different proteins had similar influences on polydopamine formation, indicating that the supramolecular structure is responsible for the observed regulating functions (see scheme).







Abstract
Polydopamine (PD) and melanin species are chemically complex systems, the formation and properties of which are incompletely understood. Inspired by the role of functional amyloids in melanin biosynthesis, this paper examines the influences of the supramolecular structure of amyloids on oxidative polymerization of dopamine. Kinetic analyses on the formation of PD species in the presence of hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) fibers or soluble HEWL revealed that both forms gave rise to the total quantity of PD species, but the rate of their formation could be accelerated only by the amyloid form. PD species formed with HEWL fibers showed a morphology of bundled fibers, whereas those with soluble HEWL had a mesh&#8208;like structure. Amyloid fibers of recombinant Pmel17 had properties similar to those of HEWL fibers in modulating PD formation. The results presented here suggest how nature designs functionality with an amyloid structure and can help understand and engineer chemistries of other functional amyloids.

      <title>A Novel [OSSO]&#8208;Type Chromium(III) Complex as a Versatile Catalyst for Copolymerization of Carbon Dioxide with Epoxides</title>
      <dc:description>
The synthesis of &#8220;green&#8221; polycarbonates from carbon dioxide and epoxides was accomplished by using a chromium catalyst bearing an [OSSO]&#8208;ligand. The unprecedented versatility of the complex and its efficiency in reactions involving linear and internal epoxides led obtaining polycarbonates with different architectures.

Abstract
A new chromium(III) complex, bearing a bis&#8208;thioether&#8208;diphenolate [OSSO]&#8208;type ligand, was found to be an efficient catalyst in the copolymerization of CO2 and epoxides to achieve poly(propylene carbonate), poly(cyclohexene carbonate), poly(hexene carbonate) and poly(styrene carbonate), as well as poly(propylene carbonate)(cyclohexene carbonate) and poly(propylene carbonate)(hexene carbonate) terpolymers.

      <title>Fundamental Aspects of Xanthene Dye Aggregation on the Surfaces of Nanocluster Polyoxometalates: H&#8208; to J&#8208;Aggregate Switching</title>
      <dc:description>
What is favorable? The deep understanding of the thermodynamic reasons leading to H&#8208;dimer formation on the surfaces of highly symmetric polyoxometalate nanoclusters is explored and the fundamental way to switch H&#8208; to J&#8208;aggregates by the design of outer shell is uncovered: H&#8208; and J&#8208;aggregates coexistence in the comb&#8208;like monolayer structure.







Abstract
The induced aggregation of the xanthene dye rhodamine&#8197;B (RhB) on metal oxide centers belonging to the highly symmetric surfaces of precise nanoscale templates with Keplerate (Mo132) or toroidal (Mo138) structures has been studied. With the joint use of the Langmuir isotherm and full Stern&#8211;Volmer models, the thermodynamic reasons for dye adsorption on the nanocluster surface, such as a mixture of monomer, H&#8208;aggregate (H&#8208;dimer), and J&#8208;aggregate forms (which can coexist or switch one into another under the exact conditions), were established: this was shown through UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopies. By using the framework of the exciton model, it is shown that the angle (&#945;) between the transition dipole moments of RhB is very sensitive to surface strain inside the dye sub&#8208;monolayer. As a result, it is possible to switch from H&#8208; to J&#8208;aggregates by the post&#8208;functionalization of polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;RhB associates by the surfactant bilayer shell, which allows the surface strain to grow. Recommendations are provided for managing the appearance of H&#8208; or J&#8208;aggregates on metal oxide (or polyelectrolyte) surfaces during photovoltaic or bioimaging applications.

      <title>Structure&#8211;Activity Relationships for the Affinity of Chaotropic Polyoxometalate Anions towards Proteins</title>
      <dc:description>
Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations and QSAR&#8208;like modeling techniques were applied to establish relationships between the structure of chaotropic polyoxometalate (POM) anions and their affinity towards biological systems. The charge density, size, and shape of POMs were identified as important parameters to balance the POM interactions with the protein and with the solvent (see figure).







Abstract
The influence of the composition of chaotropic polyoxometalate (POM) anions on their affinity to biological systems was studied by means of atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The variations in the affinity to hen egg&#8208;white lysozyme (HEWL) were analyzed along two series of POMs whereby the charge or the size and shape of the metal cluster are modified systematically. Our simulations revealed a quadratic relationship between the charge of the POM and its affinity to HEWL as a consequence of the parabolic growth of POM&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;water interaction with the charge. As the charge increases, POMs become less chaotropic (more kosmotropic) increasing the number and the strength of POM&#8211;water hydrogen bonds and structuring the solvation shell around the POM. This atomistic description explains the proportionally larger desolvation energies and less protein affinity for highly charged POMs, and consequently, the preference for moderate charge densities (q/M=0.33). Also, our simulations suggest that POM&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;protein interactions are size&#8208;specific. The cationic pockets of HEWL protein show a preference for Keggin&#8208;like structures, which display the optimal dimensions (&#8776;1&#8197;nm). Finally, we developed a quantitative multidimensional model for protein affinity with predictive ability (r2=0.97; q2=0.88) using two molecular descriptors that account for the charge density (charge per metal atom ratio; q/M) and the size and shape (shape weighted&#8208;volume; VS).

      <title>Bright Luminescent Platinum(II)&#8208;Biaryl Emitters Synthesized Without Air&#8208;Sensitive Reagents</title>
      <dc:description>
Pt complexes made easy: Platinum(II) complexes bearing biaryl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diyl ligands were synthesized without any air&#8208; or moisture&#8208;sensitive reagents, such as n&#8208;butyllithium. The prepared complexes exhibited intense green emission with high quantum efficiency of up to 0.80, even at 298&#8197;K, because of their tightly packed structure and because of the strong &#963;&#8208;donating ability of the biaryl ligand.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal complexes bearing biaryl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diyl ligands tend to show intense luminescence. However, difficulties in synthesis have prevented their further functionalization and practical applications. Herein, a series of platinum(II) complexes bearing biaryl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diyl ligands, which have never been prepared in air, were synthesized through transmetalation and successive cyclometalation of biarylboronic acids. This approach does not require any air&#8208; or moisture&#8208;sensitive reagents and features a simple synthesis even in air. The resulting (Et4N)2[Pt(m,n&#8208;F2bph)(CN)2] (m,n&#8208;F2bph=m,n&#8208;difluorobiphenyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diyl) complexes exhibit intense green emissions with high quantum efficiencies of up to 0.80 at 298&#8197;K. The emission spectral fitting and variable&#8208;temperature emission lifetime measurements indicate that the high quantum efficiency was achieved because of the tight packing structure and strong &#963;&#8208;donating ability of bph.

      <title>TMDs beyond MoS2 for Electrochemical Energy Storage
</title>
      <dc:description>
Not just MoS2! A comprehensive Review article on 2D transition metal dichalcogenide based electrodes for electrochemical energy storage devices, beyond the widely studied molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). Recent progress, challenges, and research opportunities related to use of TMD electrodes in advanced alkali metal&#8208;ion rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors are discussed.







Abstract
Atomically thin sheets of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted interest as high capacity electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage devices owing to their unique properties (high surface area, high strength and modulus, faster ion diffusion, and so on), which arise from their layered morphology and diversified chemistry. Nevertheless, low electronic conductivity, poor cycling stability, large structural changes during metal&#8208;ion insertion/extraction along with high cost of manufacture are challenges that require further research in order for TMDs to find use in commercial batteries and supercapacitors. Here, a systematic review of cutting&#8208;edge research focused on TMD materials beyond the widely studied molybdenum disulfide or MoS2 electrode is reported. Accordingly, a critical overview of the recent progress concerning synthesis methods, physicochemical and electrochemical properties is given. Trends and opportunities that may contribute to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art research are also discussed.
