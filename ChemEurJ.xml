         <title>Beyond the Diffusion Limit: Pre&#8208;Associated Ion&#8208;Pair Photoinitiating Systems for Radical Photopolymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pre&#8208;association mechanism of an ion&#8208;pair Type II photoinitiating system (PIS) acting in the visible range was studied. The choice of a dye as photoinitiator (crystal violet) with an excited state lifetime of 200 ps ensured the absence of dynamical quenching by the borate salts used as coinitiators. In spite of the fact that no diffusional bimolecular quenching can take place, excellent polymerization efficiency was found, underlining the high reactivity of the PIS. A saturation effect is observed when increasing the concentration of borate as a consequence of the pre&#8208;association mechanism arising from coulombic interaction between the cationic dye and the anionic coinitiator. The association equilibria of the system were described and the corresponding association constant values were calculated, allowing to quantify the pre&#8208;association efficiency. This was further successfully correlated to the observed maximal rates of polymerization. The efficiency of this super&#8208;stoichiometric sample with an excess of borate was finally compared to the stoichiometric 1:1 dye:borate ion&#8208;pair. It is shown that the pre&#8208;association mechanism could lead to much higher efficiency than the stoichiometric ion&#8208;pair.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Natural&#8208;Product&#8208;Inspired ABCB1 Inhibitors Through Regioselective Tryptophan C3&#8208;Benzylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 63, November 12, 2024. </description>

A regioselective derivatization of cyclo&#8208;L&#8208;Trp&#8208;L&#8208;Trp scaffold affords 34 derivatives inspired by the anticancer nocardioazine alkaloids. These natural&#8208;product inspired molecules inhibit ABCB1 drug efflux pump in PaKiT03 bat cells. One inhibitor binds to drug&#8208;binding pocket and the other at the access tunnel region. Factors driving the binding efficacy to latter region turns out to be a better predictor of the overall ABCB1 inhibitory potency.







Abstract
The emergence of drug resistance in cancer cells eventually causing relapse is a serious threat that demands new advances. Upregulation of the ATP&#8208;dependent binding cassette (ABC) transporters, such as ABCB1, significantly contributes to the emergence of drug resistance in cancer. Despite more than 30&#8197;years of therapeutic discovery, and several generations of inhibitors against P&#8208;gp, the search for effective agents that minimize toxicity to human cells, while maintaining efflux pump inhibition is still underway. Leads derived from natural product scaffolds are well&#8208;known to be effective in various therapeutic approaches. Inspired by the biosynthetic pathway to Nocardioazine A, a marine alkaloid known to inhibit the P&#8208;gp efflux pump in cancer cells, we devised a regioselective pathway to create structurally unique indole&#8208;C3&#8208;benzyl cyclo&#8208;L&#8208;Trp&#8208;L&#8208;Trp diketopiperazines (DKPs). Using bat cells as a model to derive effective ABCB1 inhibitors for targeting human P&#8208;gp efflux pumps, we have recently identified exo&#8208;C3&#8208;N&#8208;Dbn&#8208;Trp2 (13) as a lead ABCB1 inhibitor. This C3&#8208;benzylated lead inhibited ABCB1 better than Verapamil.[21] Additionally, C3&#8208;N&#8208;Dbn&#8208;Trp2 restored chemotherapy sensitivity in drug&#8208;resistant human cancer cells and had no adverse effect on cell proliferation in cell cultures. For a clearer structure&#8208;activity relationship, we developed a broader screen to test C3&#8208;functionalized pyrroloindolines as ABCB1 inhibitors and observed that C3&#8208;benzylation is outperforming respective isoprenylated derivatives. Results arising from the molecular docking studies indicate that the interactions at the access tunnel between ABCB1 and the inhibitor result in a powerful predictor for the efficacy of the inhibitor. Based on fluorescence&#8208;based assays, we conclude that the most efficacious inhibitor is the p&#8208;cyano&#8208;derived exo&#8208;C3&#8208;N&#8208;Dbn&#8208;Trp2 (33&#8201;a), closely followed by the p&#8208;nitro substituted analogue. By combining assay results with molecular docking studies, we further correlate that the predictions based on the inhibitor interactions at the access tunnel provide clues about the design of improved ABCB1 inhibitors. As it has been well documented that ABCB1 itself is powerfully engaged in multi&#8208;drug resistance, this work lays the foundation for the design of a new class of inhibitors based on the endogenous amino acid&#8208;derived cyclo&#8208;L&#8208;Trp&#8208;L&#8208;Trp DKP scaffold.

         <title>A Computational Study of Reactions with Boric Acid Aimed to Promote the Utilization of Lignin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 63, November 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The DFT calculation shows that control of the reaction of boric acid with hydroxide anion and the deprotonation of water clusters catalyzed by sodium cation are crucial to the reaction between lignin and boric acid under the alkaline condition.







Abstract
For exploring the reaction between the hydroxyl groups of lignin and boric acid under the alkaline condition, we study three proposed mechanisms for the formation of the anionic borate diester (ABDE) using the salicyl alcohol anion as the model compound by the density functional theory. ABDE has high flame retardancy and is a potentially practical application of lignin. The catalysis of sodium cation is found to enhance the deprotonation of the water cluster. The deprotonated product, hydroxide anion, is essential to the critical step, which is the cleavage of B&#8722;O bonds of the boric acid molecule, in reaction mechanisms. The energy profiles of the mechanisms show that the reaction between lignin and boric acid may start from the hydroxymethyl moieties of lignin since it requires less energy for the aforementioned critical step than from the phenol moieties of lignin. Moreover, the hydroxide anions compete with the hydroxymethyl groups in lignin for the formation of B&#8722;O bonds by forming tetrahydroxyborate anion (TBA) which requires very high activation energies to further react to the desired product ABDE. The optimal condition is to enhance the catalytic effect of sodium cations and meanwhile to control the formation of TBA.

         <title>Sequential H/D Exchanges Resulting from Rollover&#8208;Cyclometallation during Photoirradiation of Rhodium(III) Complex in Methanol&#8208;d4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 63, November 12, 2024. </description>

Photoirradiation of [Rh(N&#8201;N)(C&#8201;N)(H)(CD3OD)]+ (N&#8201;N=6,6&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine, C&#8201;N=[6,6&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine]&#8208;3&#8208;yl&#8208;&#954;C3,&#954;N1&#8217;) provides [Rh(N&#8201;N)2]+, which is a transient species, and immediately regenerates [Rh(N&#8201;N)(C&#8201;N)(H)(CD3OD)]+ by spontaneous cyclometallation. The reversible turnover of the pyridine ring proceeds accompanied by H/D exchange of the H atoms in the Rh&#8722;H bond and at the 3, 3&#8217;&#8208;positions of the N&#8201;N ligand during the photoirradiation.







Abstract
We present the photoreaction of newly prepared bis(6,6&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine)(oxalato)rhodium(III) ([Rh(N&#8201;N)2(ox)]+) in CD3OD. Photoirradiation of this complex causes the dissociation of ox, followed by the formation of the unprecedented Rh(III) complex with Rh&#8722;H and Rh&#8722;C &#963; bonds, [Rh(N&#8201;N)(C&#8201;N)(H)(CD3OD)]+ (C&#8201;N=[6,6&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine]&#8208;3&#8208;yl&#8208;&#954;C3,&#954;N1&#8217;). This hydride formation and cyclometallation spontaneously proceed owing to the conflict between the steric hindrance arising from the methyl groups of N&#8201;N and the driving force for the structural change due to [Rh(N&#8201;N)2]+ formation. Although [Rh(N&#8201;N)(C&#8201;N)(H)(CD3OD)]+ is initially converted to [Rh(N&#8201;N)2]+ by photoirradiation, it is immediately regenerated by the rollover cyclometallation of the [Rh(N&#8201;N)2]+ complex. [Rh(N&#8201;N)(C&#8201;N)(H)(CD3OD)]+ undergoes H/D exchange for the H atoms in the Rh&#8722;H bond and at the 3, 3&#8217;&#8208;positions of the N&#8201;N ligand during the photoirradiation. DFT calculations predict with reasonable certainty the spontaneous structural change of [Rh(N&#8201;N)2]+ to [Rh(N&#8201;N)(C&#8201;N)(H)(CD3OD)]+ and the subsequent photodriven Rh&#8722;C bond rupture leading to the formation of [Rh(N&#8201;N)2]+ accompanied by H/D exchange reactions.

The reversible turnover of the pyridine ring proceeds accompanied by H/D exchange of the H atoms in the Rh&#8722;H bond and at the 3, 3&#8217;-positions of the N&#8201;N ligand during the photoirradiation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present the photoreaction of newly prepared bis(6,6&#8217;-dimethyl-2,2&#8217;-bipyridine)(oxalato)rhodium(III) ([Rh(N&#8201;N)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(ox)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) in CD&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OD. Photoirradiation of this complex causes the dissociation of ox, followed by the formation of the unprecedented Rh(III) complex with Rh&#8722;H and Rh&#8722;C &#963; bonds, [Rh(N&#8201;N)(C&#8201;N)(H)(CD&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OD)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (C&#8201;N=[6,6&#8217;-dimethyl-2,2&#8217;-bipyridine]-3-yl-&#954;&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;,&#954;&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&#8217;&lt;/sup&gt;). This hydride formation and cyclometallation spontaneously proceed owing to the conflict between the steric hindrance arising from the methyl groups of N&#8201;N and the driving force for the structural change due to [Rh(N&#8201;N)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; formation. Although [Rh(N&#8201;N)(C&#8201;N)(H)(CD&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OD)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is initially converted to [Rh(N&#8201;N)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; by photoirradiation, it is immediately regenerated by the rollover cyclometallation of the [Rh(N&#8201;N)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; complex. [Rh(N&#8201;N)(C&#8201;N)(H)(CD&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OD)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; undergoes H/D exchange for the H atoms in the Rh&#8722;H bond and at the 3, 3&#8217;-positions of the N&#8201;N ligand during the photoirradiation. DFT calculations predict with reasonable certainty the spontaneous structural change of [Rh(N&#8201;N)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to [Rh(N&#8201;N)(C&#8201;N)(H)(CD&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OD)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and the subsequent photodriven Rh&#8722;C bond rupture leading to the formation of [Rh(N&#8201;N)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; accompanied by H/D exchange reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Environmentally friendly process for synthesizing heterocyclic molecules of therapeutic interest with the quinazoline&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;thione core structure, using bio&#8208;based recyclable solvents.







Abstract
Given the importance of quinazolines and quinazolinethiones in therapeutic and Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#8208;approved molecules, we thought interesting to consider their synthesis in green solvents. We have shown that obtain 4&#8208;(arylamino)quinazoline&#8208;2&#8208;(1H)&#8208;thiones and 4&#8208;(arylamino)pteridine&#8208;2&#8208;(1H)&#8208;thiones analogues was efficient in green solvents derived from biomass, especially eucalyptol. Although reaction times are somewhat long to achieve good yields, the products were obtained by simple filtration. This considerably limited the loss of atoms due to the use of large quantities of solvents for purification on silica gel columns, and makes our route a sustainable one.

         <title>Consequences of the Pb&#8722;S Bond Formation for Lead Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 63, November 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur radical used instead of the A cation in lead halide perovskites builds the Pb&#8722;S covalent bond, confirmed by the quantum theory of atoms in molecules and non&#8208;covalent interactions index. This bond triggers a phase transition to stable non&#8208;perovskite structure that hosts multiexcitons obeying the exciton&#8208;fission preconditions, according to an analysis derived from the Bethe&#8211;Salpeter equation.







Abstract
Lead halide perovskites are structurally not stable due to their ionic bonds. Using sulfur agents in the crystal growth improves the stability and performance of the photovoltaic and light&#8208;emitting devices. In this theoretical work, we use a small toy S&#8208;radical in place of A cation in the bulk of lead iodide perovskite, and highlight the significance of the Pb&#8722;S covalent&#8208;double&#8208;bond formation for: the charge redistribution on the neighboring bonds that also turn to be covalent, phase transformation to a stable non&#8208;perovskite structure, and superior optoelectronic properties. The chemical analysis was performed with the Quantum Theory of Atoms In Molecules (QTAIM) and Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions (NCI) index. Excitonic properties were obtained from the solution of ab initio Bethe&#8211;Salpeter equation. Presence of the spin&#8208;orbit coupling triggers an interplay between the Frenkel and charge&#8208;transfer multiexcitons, switching between the photovoltaic and laser applications. Multiexcitons obey the exciton&#8208;fission preconditions.

Efficient transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free synthesis of benzo[b]azepines and oxindoles is achieved via a radical relay cascade strategy employing halogen atom transfer (XAT) for aryl radical generation followed by intramolecular hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). Optimization yielded moderate to substantial yields under visible light irradiation. Preliminary biological assessments revealed promising anti&#8208;tumor activity for select compounds. This study underscores the potential of XAT&#8208;mediated radical relay cascades in medicinal chemistry and anticancer drug discovery.

         <title>Interdependent Dynamic Nitroaldol and Boronic Ester Reactions for Complex Dynamers of Different Topologies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 63, November 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic systems based on interdependent nitroaldol and boronate reactions have been demonstrated. Bifunctional building blocks led to mainchain nitroaldol&#8208;boronate dynamers as well as multi&#8208;dynamic networks with distinct topologies. The features of the dynamers were dependent on the boronic acid configuration.







Abstract
Complex dynamic systems displaying interdependency between nitroaldol and boronic ester reactions have been demonstrated. Nitroalkane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diols, generated by the nitroaldol reaction, were susceptible to ester formation with different boronic acids in aprotic solvents, whereas hydrolysis of the esters occurred in the presence of water. The boronic ester formation led to significant stabilization of the nitroaldol adducts under basic conditions. The use of bifunctional building blocks was furthermore established, allowing for main chain nitroaldol&#8208;boronate dynamers as well as complex network dynamers with distinct topologies. The shape and rigidity of the resulting dynamers showed an apparent dependency on the configuration of the boronic acids.

         <title>Heterometallic&#8208;Organic Cages with Customized Cavities: Constructed by Bottom&#8208;Up Step&#8208;Wise Coordination&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Assembly</title>

Three heterometallic&#8208;organic cages with customized size and cavity have been precisely constructed using bottom&#8208;up step&#8208;wise coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly strategy. First, three Ru2+&#8208;connected dendritic ligands were synthesized from initial tripodal building blocks. Then, further self&#8208;assembly of metal&#8208;organic ligands with Fe2+ quantitatively generate the desired tetrahedral cages, respectively.







Abstract
Accurately synthesizing coordination&#8208;driven metal&#8208;organic cages with customized shape and cavity remains a great challenge for chemists. In this work, a bottom&#8208;up step&#8208;wise coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly approach was put forward. Employing this strategy, three terpyridyl heterometallic&#8208;organic truncated tetrahedral cages with different sizes and cavity were precisely synthesized. Firstly, the coordination of tripodal organic ligands with Ru2+ afforded dendritic metal&#8208;organic ligands L1&#8208;L3. Then the Ru building blocks complexed with Fe2+ and shrunk to form the desired heterometallic&#8208;organic cages (C1&#8208;C3). These discrete heterometallic&#8208;organic supramolecular cages were fully characterized and displayed the large and open cavities varied from 7205&#8197;&#197;3 to 9384&#8197;&#197;3. Notably, these cages could not be directly constructed by single&#8208;step assembly process using initial organic ligands or dimeric metal&#8208;organic ligands, indicative of the irreplaceability of a bottom&#8208;up step&#8208;wise assembly strategy for size&#8208;customized architectures. This work paves a new way for precisely constructing metal&#8208;organic cages with well&#8208;defined cavities.

         <title>Construction of Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Encapsulation of Menthol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 63, November 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of cyclodextrin based COFs were fabricated through a facile microwave method. These COFs, with higher surface area and new cavities compared to native CDs, enabled the encapsulation of menthol with higher efficiency, and the strengthening interaction between menthol and CD&#8208;COFs also enhanced the thermal stability of menthol. This innovative work significantly advances and expands menthol encapsulation strategies.







Abstract
The application of flavoring ingredients like menthol in the food industry is hindered by their high volatility and poor thermal stability, which lead to significant losses during processing and storage. Encapsulation of flavors into porous materials to obtain inclusion complexes (ICs) has proved to be an efficient strategy. In the present study, we synthesized a series of relatively food&#8208;safe three&#8208;dimensional anionic cyclodextrin&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (CD&#8208;COFs) with spiroborate linkages using a facile microwave&#8208;assisted method. The high surface area and newly formed cavities of COFs significantly enhanced the encapsulation efficiency of menthol compared to native CD materials. Our findings revealed that &#947;&#8208;CD&#8208;COF&#8722;Li, with Li+ as the counterion, achieved superior encapsulation efficiency of 25.9&#8201;%, outperforming &#947;&#8208;CD&#8208;COF&#8722;Na, &#947;&#8208;CD&#8208;COF&#8722;K and &#945;&#8208;CD&#8208;COF&#8722;Li under the same conditions. Thermal stability measurements show that the menthol/&#947;&#8208;CD&#8208;COF&#8722;Li&#8208;ICs effectively stabilize menthol against heat evaporation at elevated temperatures due to the strengthened interaction between menthol and &#947;&#8208;CD&#8208;COF&#8722;Li. The promising results of this research suggest that rapid advancements in COF technology will provide new opportunities for enhancing the stability of flavoring ingredients in the food industry.

         <title>Novel Methods for the Formation of Free Carbyne Radicals in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 63, November 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Radicalously simple&#8221;: we describe two new methods that produce free carbyne radicals) once considered very exotic) under mild conditions. Metallic zinc reacts with acetic anhydride to form 2&#8208;butyne and other products indicative of methyl&#8208;carbyne radical in solution. These reactive species are also obtained upon the degradation of a tri&#8208;molybdenum complex containing a 2&#8208;butyne ligand in aqueous solution.







Abstract
Carbyne free radicals 
 (RC) are usually associated with high&#8208;energy processes, thus research on their preparation, chemical reactivity, and prevalence under mild conditions is scarce. Recently, it was reported that metallo&#8208;complexes containing CR ligands may undergo spontaneous degradation in aqueous solutions to produce free RC radicals. These highly reactive species may react with each other to form the corresponding alkyne and other products. The reaction of 1,1,1 halo&#8208;carbo&#8208;hydrates with Cr(II) ions also forms RC radicals under mild conditions. Herein, we report two additional synthetic routes that produce free RC radicals under mild conditions. First, the reaction between metallic zinc and acetic anhydride produces 2&#8208;butyne and several other C2, C3, and C4 compounds. Isotopic&#8208;labeling experiments indicate that the formation of 2&#8208;butyne results from an inter&#8208;molecular reaction in which two RC moieties from two acetic anhydride molecules combine in solution. In addition, the degradation of the tri&#8208;molybdenum complex [Mo3(H3CC&#8801;CCH3)(OAc)(H2O)2Br7], in which a 2&#8208;butyne ligand is coordinated to the Mo3 framework in a &#956;3&#8208;&#951;2 (&#8869;) binding mode in aqueous solution produces several C2, C3, C4 and C5 molecules. This indicates the formation of free CH3C radicals by a homolytic cleavage of the carbon&#8208;carbon triple bond.

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Radicalously simple&#8221;: we describe two new methods that produce free carbyne radicals) once considered very exotic) under mild conditions. Metallic zinc reacts with acetic anhydride to form 2-butyne and other products indicative of methyl-carbyne radical in solution. These reactive species are also obtained upon the degradation of a tri-molybdenum complex containing a 2-butyne ligand in aqueous solution.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbyne free radicals 
 (RC) are usually associated with high-energy processes, thus research on their preparation, chemical reactivity, and prevalence under mild conditions is scarce. Recently, it was reported that metallo-complexes containing CR ligands may undergo spontaneous degradation in aqueous solutions to produce free RC radicals. These highly reactive species may react with each other to form the corresponding alkyne and other products. The reaction of 1,1,1 halo-carbo-hydrates with Cr(II) ions also forms RC radicals under mild conditions. Herein, we report two additional synthetic routes that produce free RC radicals under mild conditions. First, the reaction between metallic zinc and acetic anhydride produces 2-butyne and several other C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; compounds. Isotopic-labeling experiments indicate that the formation of 2-butyne results from an inter-molecular reaction in which two RC moieties from two acetic anhydride molecules combine in solution. In addition, the degradation of the tri-molybdenum complex [Mo&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CC&#8801;CCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(OAc)(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;], in which a 2-butyne ligand is coordinated to the Mo&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; framework in a &#956;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-&#951;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&#8869;) binding mode in aqueous solution produces several C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; molecules. This indicates the formation of free CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C radicals by a homolytic cleavage of the carbon-carbon triple bond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Conformation Regulation of Trisresorcinarene Directed by Cavity Solvation</title>

Trisresorcinarene is a synthetic macrocycle comprising three resorcinarene units covalently connected by odd&#8208;numbered alkyl chains. This macrocycle can adopt two conformers (open and closed forms), and their relative populations are influenced by the solvent.







Abstract
This compound is a synthetic macrocycle comprising three pivaloyl&#8208;protected resorcinarene units connected by six pentylene chains. We conducted a conformational study using 1H&#8208;NMR, X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), and computational analyses. The macrocycle adopts two conformers, one open, the other closed. The ratio of the open to closed forms depended on the solvent used. Only the open form existed in [D8]toluene, both forms coexisted in [D6]benzene, and the closed form was the major conformer in [D1]chloroform. The benzene&#8208;solvated open form observed in the solid state suggests that cavity solvation by solvent molecules directs the open form. The open form was the major or only conformer in [D10]o&#8208; and [D10]m&#8208;xylene and [D12]mesitylene, whereas the closed form was the major conformer in [D6]acetone. The open and closed forms were equally populated in [D10]p&#8208;xylene, suggesting that the size, shape, and dimensions of the solvent molecules most likely influenced the conformation of the protected trisresocinarene.

Abstract
Sr4Ba3(BO3)3.83H2.5, as the second compound to combine borate and hydride ions, has been synthesized by a mechanochemical synthesis route. The structure has been elucidated by synchrotron X&#8208;ray and neutron diffraction and determined to crystallize in the non&#8208;centrosymmetric space group P63mc (186) with the cell parameters a=10.87762(15)&#8197;&#197; and c=6.98061(11)&#8197;&#197;. A detailed investigation of the compound by vibrational spectroscopy in combination with Density Functional Theory calculations reveals the disordered nature of the structure and proves the presence of both borate and hydride ions. Electronic band structure calculations predict a large band gap of 7.1&#8197;eV. Hydride states are predicted at the topmost valence band, which agrees well with earlier reported heteroanionic hydrides. We hereby were able to successfully apply previously synthetic and analytical schemes to introduce another member of the rare compounds that contain complex oxoanions simultaneously with hydride ions.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Sensitized CO2 Methanation along a Relaxed Heat Available Route</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 63, November 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid material, Pt/N&#8208;doped TiO2/Perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxy&#8208; diimide (PDI) composite was designed for using the relaxed heat from incident light to upgrade CO2 methanation with H2O. Excellent photothermal efficiency of PDI, positive temperature sensibility of Ti&#8722;H species and hyperreactive site of Pt NPs together enable highly reactive and selective methane production for CO2 reduction.







Abstract
In photocatalysis, the resulted heat by the relaxation of most of incident light no longer acts as the industrially favorite driving force back to the target photo&#8208;reaction due to more or less the negative relation between photocatalytic efficiency and temperature. Here, we reported a visible light&#8208;sensitized protocol that completely reversed the negatively temperature&#8208;dependent efficiency in photo&#8208;driven CO2 methanation with saturated water vapor. Uniform Pt/N&#8208;TiO2/PDI self&#8208;assembly material decisively injects the excited electron of PDI sensitizer into N&#8208;TiO2 forming Ti&#8722;H hydride which is crucially temperature&#8208;dependent nucleophilic species to dominate CO2 methanation, rather than conventionally separated and trapped electrons on the conductor band. Meanwhile, the ternary composite lifts itself temperature from room temperature to 305.2&#8201;&#176;C within 400&#8197;s only by the failure excitation upon simulated sunlight of 2.5&#8197;W/cm2, and smoothly achieves CO2 methanation with a record number of 4.98&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 rate, compared to less than 0.02&#8197;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at classic Pt/N&#8208;TiO2/UV photocatalysis without PDI sensitization. This approach can reuse ~53.9&#8201;% of the relaxed heat energy from the incident light thereby allow high&#8208;intensity incident light as strong as possible within a flowing photo&#8208;reactor, opening the most likely gateways to industrialization.

A pivaloyl&#8208;protected triangular tris&#8208;resorcinarene&#8212;a synthetic macrocycle consisting of three protected resorcinarene units linked by six pentylene chains&#8212;adopts open and closed conformations in solution. The open&#8211;closed conformation equilibrium is solvent&#8208;dependent. Shape&#8208;complementary solvent molecules facilitate solvation of the cavity interior to promote the open conformation, whereas the closed conformation is preferred in solvent molecules that are not complementary to the cavity interior.

         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature shows artificial photosynthesis to convert H2O vapour/CO2 into the value&#8208;added chemical CH4. Intermediate temperature&#8208;sensitive Ti&#8722;H species are generated by the photosensitized PDI dye component of the Pt/N&#8722;TiO2/PDI composite catalyst; this enables incident light energy that has relaxed into waste heat to locally heat a highly nucleophilic hydride for CO2 addition to a COOH* intermediate. (Until now it had been thought that photocatalysis and temperature were almost negatively dependent.) Shown top left is the photoexcitation process by which electrons are transferred to the TiO2 surface to generate Ti&#8722;H species; this converts 53&#8201;% of the relaxed incident light into a thermal effect to be re&#8208;used. Shown top right is the acceleration of the reaction rate through increasing the initial energy of the rate&#8208;limiting step as the catalyst surface temperature increases and it becomes easier to cross the activation barrier. More information can be found in the Research Article by D. Ma, H. Ji, W. Ma, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202402102).

A group of four white discs at the center of the Othello board represents the pyridine rings of the complex [Rh(N^N)2]+. The complex undergoes rollover cyclometallation of one of the pyridine rings to afford [Rh(N^N)(C^N)(H)(CH3OH)]+, [Rh(N^N)(N^C)(H)(CH3OH)]+, [Rh(C^N)(N^N)(H)(CH3OH)]+, or [Rh(N^C)(N^N)(H)(CH3OH)]+ at the same probability, which are represented as groups of one black disc and three white discs. Upon irradiation (white beam), every black disc turns over to return to the group of four white discs. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Shinozaki and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202402067).

The Cover Feature illustrates the sample environment of a neutron diffraction instrument filled with tetrahedra. These tetrahedra are key structural elements of the reported compound Sr4Ba3(BO3)3.83H2.5 and represent the sample. The blue ray displays the neutron beam that gets scattered by the central tetrahedron. Only by the means of neutron diffraction, was it possible to determine the exact chemical composition, particularly of the tetrahedra. In this case, a unique complex [BO3H]4&#8722; anion was discovered. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Mutschke and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202403048).

         <title>Manganese(II) Porphyrin and Cumyl Hydroperoxide: An Efficient Catalyst for Aryl&#8208;Pentazole C&#8722;N Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient catalytic system composed of manganese(II) tetraphenylporphyrin and cumyl hydroperoxide was developed to afford the cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722; anion from aryl&#8208;pentazole in a 35.4&#8201;% yield over 4&#8197;hours. Mechanistic investigations revealed that Mn(IV)&#8208;oxo porphyrins and &#8901;CH3 radicals initiated C&#8722;N bond cleavage in aryl&#8208;pentazole selectively. Our findings provide a new perspective on radical&#8208;induced C&#8722;N activation for the preparation of other N&#8208;containing heterocycles.







Abstract
The selective cleavage of C&#8722;N bonds in N&#8208;containing compounds holds significant research value in organic synthesis, particularly for the synthesis of promising polynitrogen species. For instance, the discovery of the cyclo&#8208;pentazolate (cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722;) anion in 2017 as a result of cleavage of the C&#8722;N bond has sparked interest within the field of high energy density materials. However, previous methods using ferrous glycinate and m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid generated the cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722; anion in a low yield of 19.5&#8201;% after 24&#8197;hours, and the mechanism remained unclear. In this study, we developed an efficient catalytic system comprising Mn (II) tetraphenylporphyrin and cumyl hydroperoxide. This system enables the cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722; anion to be produced from 3,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxyphenylpentazole in 35.4&#8201;% yield in 4&#8197;hours. Characterization of Mn(IV)&#8208;oxo porphyrins, &#8901;CH3, and &#8901;C8H8ON5 radicals provides evidence for the mechanism whereby the cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722; anion forms. Our study underscores the competitive potential of radical&#8208;initiated selective C&#8722;N bonds cleavage in N&#8208;arylazoles and opens avenues for further exploration in this field.

         <title>Formulation and Release of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Using a Supramolecular Self&#8208;Healing Two&#8208;Component Gel</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

A low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelator (LMWG) was formulated with a variety of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) &#8208; APIs must be carefully chosen to optimise formulation and release. The thixotropic atropine&#8208;loaded gel controlled the release of atropine over a period of hours, suggesting supramolecular gels have promise as a potential approach for treating myopia.







Abstract
A two&#8208;component low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelator (LMWG) formed from a modified amino acid and an aldehyde was formulated with active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). Basic APIs (propranolol, atropine) can be mixed with the LMWG prior to gel assembly while acidic APIs (naproxen, rosuvastatin) inhibit assembly by disrupting the LMWG imine bond and were loaded by diffusion after gel assembly. For diffusion&#8208;loaded gels, the API in the liquid&#8208;like phase was rapidly released, with the remainder, interacting with gel fibres, retained in the gel. Rosuvastatin release was particularly low with Saturation Transfer Difference (STD) NMR indicating interactions between the aromatic ring and the self&#8208;assembled gel network. Propranolol also interacted with the gel via its aromatic unit, and its release led to gel erosion. Using agarose as a polymer gelator additive reinforced the gel, restricting erosion. In contrast, atropine was readily released over a period of hours &#8208; it is primarily in the liquid&#8208;like phase with STD NMR indicating no interactions with the gel network. The atropine&#8208;loaded gel retained its thixotropic properties. Overall, APIs must be carefully chosen to optimise formulation/release. Of the APIs investigated, atropine has most potential for further development. Atropine has applications in treating myopia, and our results suggest potential ophthalmic applications of supramolecular gels.

         <title>Gallatabenzene Ligands Emerging from Open Lutetocene and Yttrocene Methyl Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully open metallocene (2,4&#8208;dtbp)2LuMe (I) is isolable and stable only at low temperatures and features a superbasic vital intermediate for subsequent ring&#8208;closure reactions. So accessible bis(gallatabenzene) complexes (1&#8208;Me&#8208;3,5&#8208;tBu2&#8208;C5H3Ga)(&#956;&#8208;Me)Ln(1&#8208;Me&#8208;3,5&#8208;tBu2&#8208;C5H3Ga) (Ln=Y, Lu (II)) exhibit almost planar metallacycles, while the respective aluminatabenzene chemistry follows distinct reaction pathways.







Abstract
Utilizing ternary mixtures [LnMe3]n/K(2,4&#8208;dtbp)/GaMe3 (Ln=Lu, Y; 2,4&#8208;dtbp=2,4&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;pentadienyl), a series of metallacycles is accessible via tandem salt metathesis/deprotonation. Depending on the precursor molar ratio, both gallatabenzene and lutetacyclic moieties with fully planar metallacycles are obtained, which were further analyzed using DFT calculations. The precursor molar ratio affects the extent of pentadienyl C&#8722;H&#8208;bond activation and oligomerization to tetra&#8208; and pentametallic arrays. Reacting a 1&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2 mixture at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C gave the open sandwich methyl complex (2,4&#8208;dtbp)2Lu(CH3), displaying a vital intermediate for subsequent ring&#8208;closure reactions.

         <title>Synthesis of &#960;&#8208;Extended [1.1]Paracyclophanes, [1.1][n]PCP (n=2, 3, and 4), and Their Through&#8208;Space Conjugation</title>

[1.1][n]Paracyclophanes ([1.1][n]PCPs) (3) with n=2, 3, and 4, which consist of two [n]paraphenylene units connected by methylene bridges, were synthesized using short synthetic pathways with good overall yields. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses reveal that the paraphenylene unit in 3 is bent, resulting in an elliptic core structure of 3. The facing bridgehead carbons of the paraphenylene units are separated by a distance much shorter than the sum of the van der Waals radii of sp2&#8208;carbon atoms. UV&#8208;vis absorption spectra, fluorescence spectra, electrochemical measurements, and theoretical calculations were used to demonstrate the presence of through&#8208;space (TS) conjugation in 3. Furthermore, host&#8208;guest complex formation between 3D (n=3) and tetracyanoquinodimethane in the solid state was revealed.

         <title>Trace Amount of Ir Decorated NiFe Phosphide In&#8208;Situ Grown on Carbon Cloth as Cost&#8208;Effective Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trace iridium modified NiFe phosphide (Ir&#8208;NiFePx/CC) was in&#8208;situ grown on carbon cloth by a simple wet chemical method, followed by a phosphorization post treatment at a relatively low temperature. The best&#8208;performing electrocatalyst, Ir2&#8208;NiFePx/CC, shows excellent OER activity, with an overpotential of 190&#8197;mV for alkaline OER at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and an ideal long&#8208;term stability over 90&#8197;h.







Abstract
Cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts is a key constituent to establish the balance of cost and catalytic efficiency for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) via water electrolysis in the area of energy conversion and storage. NiFe phosphide decorated with trace amount of iridium (Ir) species in&#8208;situ grown on carbon cloth was prepared by a facile wet chemistry approach followed by a phosphorization post&#8208;treatment at a relative low temperature. The optimal electrocatalyst, Ir2&#8208;NiFePx/CC, exhibits excellent OER activity, with an low overpotential of 190&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for alkaline OER, and a desirable long&#8208;term durability over 90&#8197;h. The outstanding OER performance stems from the structural evolution via phosphorization process, Ir decoration with more high&#8208;valence stated Ir4+ species, and tight connection between individual components of the electrode, which gives rise to the strong activity to the active sites and faster reaction kinetics in the alkaline OER process. Mover, the Ir loading was as low as approximately ~1.7&#8197;wt&#8201;% (0.29&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2), showing promissing propective in cost&#8208;effective OER.

         <title>Elevating Nonlinear Optical Response Through D&#8208;Electron Modulation in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a nonlinear optical (NLO) modulation strategy through regulating electronic structure within metal&#8208;organic frameworks, and the minor variations in the coordination transition metal ions played a vital role in regulating of NLO performance. This approach provides a promising platform for investigating the intrinsic mechanisms of NLO activity modulation through both theoretical and experimental perspectives.







Abstract
Electronic structure and excited state behavior is of pronounced influence on regulation of nonlinear optical (NLO) response. Herein, a serials of transition metal ions bearing different d&#8208;electron numbers were in&#8197;situ coordinated within porphyrinic metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), creating NLO&#8208;responsive M&#8208;metal (metal=Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) frameworks. It demonstrated that the NLO properties can be optimized with the increased occupancy of the d&#8208;shell, which enhances the degree of delocalization. Specifically, the full&#8208;filled (d10) electron configuration of Zn2+ stabilizes the electronic structure, combination with &#960;&#8211;&#960;* local excitation character of M&#8722;Zn, promoting charge transfer process and resulting in outstanding NLO properties. Moreover, parameters related to the nonlinear process (&#946;, n2, Im&#967;(3), Re&#967;(3) and &#967;(3)) of M&#8722;Zn are calculated to be higher than those of other materials, consistent with theoretical calculations. This work paves the way for NLO modulation based on electronic analysis and provides a promising approach for constructing high&#8208;performance NLO materials.

         <title>Modular Design and Self&#8208;assembly of pH&#8208;Responsive Multidomain Peptides Incorporating Non&#8208;natural Ionic Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of acid&#8208;responsive peptide assembly incorporating non&#8208;natural ionic amino acids is reported. The transition pH of these assemblies is dictated by the hydrophobic microenvironment around the ionic residues and highly tunable in the weakly acidic range. These materials demonstrate great potential for the development of acid&#8208;activatable antimicrobial therapy.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive peptides, particularly pH&#8208;responsive variants, hold significant promise in biomedical and technological applications by leveraging the broad pH spectrum inherent to biological environments. However, the limited number of natural pH&#8208;responsive amino acids within biologically relevant pH ranges presents challenges for designing rational pH&#8208;responsive peptide assemblies. In our study, we introduce a novel approach by incorporating a library of non&#8208;natural amino acids featuring chemically diverse tertiary amine side chains. Hydrophobic and ionic properties of these non&#8208;natural amino acids facilitate their incorporation into the assembly domain when uncharged, and electrostatic repulsion promotes disassembly under lower pH conditions. Furthermore, we observed a direct relationship between the number of substitutions and the hydrophobicity of these amino acids, influencing their pH&#8208;responsive properties and enabling rational design based on desired transitional pH ranges. The structure&#8208;activity relationship of these pH&#8208;responsive peptides was evaluated by assessing their antimicrobial properties, as their antimicrobial activity is triggered by the disassembly of peptides to release active monomers. This approach not only enhances the specificity and controllability of pH responsiveness but also broadens the scope of peptide materials in biomedical and technological applications.

         <title>In Situ Self&#8208;Assembly of Antibody&#8208;Rhamnose Complex as a Pre&#8208;Targeting Strategy for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel pre&#8208;targeting strategy that combines host&#8208;guest chemistry with an antibody&#8208;recruiting concept was developed to enhance cancer immunotherapy. After binding to the target site, rituximab&#8208;adamantane conjugates self&#8208;assemble with rhamnose&#8208;modified &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin to form rituximab&#8208;rhamnose complexes. These complexes significantly amplify Fc effector function by recruiting endogenous anti&#8208;rhamnose antibodies.







Abstract
Enhancing the Fc effector functions of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is a proven strategy for improving cancer immunotherapy. In this study, we present a novel pre&#8208;targeting approach that integrates host&#8208;guest chemistry with an antibody&#8208;recruiting concept to create mAbs with superior effector functions. Using rituximab (RTX), a clinically approved anti&#8208;CD20 mAb, as our model, we modified RTX by conjugating it with adamantane (Ada) derivatives and various polyethylene glycol (PEG) linkers to produce RTX&#8208;Ada conjugates. These conjugates effectively formed RTX&#8208;rhamnose (Rha) complexes in&#8197;situ through self&#8208;assembly, driven by host&#8208;guest interactions with Rha&#8208;modified &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin. This mechanism successfully redirected endogenous anti&#8208;Rha antibodies to target cells, enhancing the availability of Fc domains for improved effector functions, including complement&#8208;dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). A structure&#8208;activity relationship study indicated that the potency of these in&#8197;situ complexes was significantly influenced by the length of the PEG linker used; shorter PEG linkers correlated with higher CDC activity. Given the variability in endogenous antibody levels among individuals, this strategy presents a flexible and promising platform for enhancing the efficacy of mAb&#8208;based cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Simultaneous Hydrogenation of an Insulated Diarylacetylene Dimer Incorporated as Axle Molecules in a Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based [c2]Daisy Chain Rotaxane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An &#8216;impossible&#8217; [c2]daisy chain rotaxane was synthesized for the first time through the simultaneous hydrogenation of both diarylacetylene moieties within a pre&#8208;prepared [c2]daisy chain rotaxane. This study demonstrates that [c2]daisy chain rotaxanes can undergo chemical modification owing to their unique structural features, thereby advancing the development of functional interlocked molecules.







Abstract
The [c2]daisy chain rotaxane is an attractive interlocked molecule for the development of functional materials because of its unique mechanical properties that respond to various external stimuli, resulting in extension and contraction motions along the molecular axis. The synthesis of several &#8216;impossible&#8217; [2]rotaxanes that do not exhibit obvious binding motifs between their axle and wheel moieties has been achieved through further chemical modification of their axle moieties within pre&#8208;prepared [2]rotaxanes. However, no &#8216;impossible&#8217; [c2]daisy chain rotaxane has been synthesized using similar strategies until now. In this study, we investigated the hydrogenation of diarylacetylene moieties within a permethylated &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (PM &#945;&#8208;CD)&#8208;based [c2]daisy chain rotaxane using Pd/C or Pd/CaCO3 under hydrogen. A new [c2]daisy chain rotaxane featuring two diarylethane moieties was successfully synthesized through the simultaneous full hydrogenation of the insulated diarylacetylene moieties under optimized conditions. The new rotaxane is classified as an &#8216;impossible&#8217; [c2]daisy chain rotaxane due to the lack of obvious binding motifs between diarylethane and the PM &#945;&#8208;CD. This work demonstrates for the first time that the insulated axle moieties of [c2]daisy chain rotaxanes can undergo novel chemical modifications using a synthetic strategy employing transition metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation, which can potentially advance the development of nanoarchitectures with functional interlocked molecules.

         <title>Pure Shift NMR in Continuous Flow</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pure shift NMR provides highly resolved spectra that are very useful for the analysis of mixtures. Standard pure shift NMR methods are, however, not compatible with sample motion, and thus with the broad range of applications that involve a flowing sample. We show that high quality pure shift NMR spectra can be obtained for a continuously flowing sample, and illustrate the approach with the online monitoring of a tosylation reaction.







Abstract
Flow NMR is an expanding analytical approach with applications that include in&#8208;line analysis for process control and optimisation, and real&#8208;time reaction monitoring. The samples monitored by flow NMR are typically mixtures that yield complex 1D 1H spectra. &#8220;Pure shift&#8221; NMR is a powerful approach to simplifying 1H NMR spectra, but its standard implementation is not compatible with continuous flow because of interference between sample motion and the position&#8208;dependent spin manipulations that are required in pure shift NMR. Here we show that pure shift NMR spectra can be successfully collected for continuously flowing samples, thanks to an adapted acquisition scheme, robust solvent suppression, and a velocity&#8208;compensation strategy. The resulting method is used to collect ultrahigh resolution reaction monitoring data. Pure shift NMR spectra are expected to benefit many applications of flow NMR.

&lt;p&gt;Flow NMR is an expanding analytical approach with applications that include in-line analysis for process control and optimisation, and real-time reaction monitoring. The samples monitored by flow NMR are typically mixtures that yield complex 1D &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H spectra. &#8220;Pure shift&#8221; NMR is a powerful approach to simplifying &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR spectra, but its standard implementation is not compatible with continuous flow because of interference between sample motion and the position-dependent spin manipulations that are required in pure shift NMR. Here we show that pure shift NMR spectra can be successfully collected for continuously flowing samples, thanks to an adapted acquisition scheme, robust solvent suppression, and a velocity-compensation strategy. The resulting method is used to collect ultrahigh resolution reaction monitoring data. Pure shift NMR spectra are expected to benefit many applications of flow NMR.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unveiling the Ultrafast Excitation Energy Transfer in Tetraarylpyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole&#8208;BODIPY Dyads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two dyads comprising of tetraarylpyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole (TAPP) and BODIPY are synthesized. Fast energy transfer from TAPP to BODIPY unit (ETE~99.9&#8201;%) are observed in both the dyads. Ultrafast spectroscopic studies of dyad&#8197;1 show TAPP to BODIPY energy transfer in 125&#8197;fs (kET=8.0&#215;1012&#8201;s&#8722;1) which is one of the fastest energy transfer events in BODIPY based dyad reported so far.







Abstract
We have synthesized two dyads (dyad&#8197;1 and 2) comprising of tetraarylpyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole (TAPP) and BODIPY. In dyad&#8197;1, two BODIPYs are directly connected with TAPP moiety whereas in dyad&#8197;2, BODIPYs are connected through phenylethynyl linkers. TAPP is a blue energy donor which is easy to synthesize and functionalize as compared to other well&#8208;known blue energy donors like pyrene, perylene etc. This is the first report of using TAPP as an energy donor in BODIPY based dyad molecules. Complete quenching of TAPP fluorescence in the dyads suggests fast energy transfer from TAPP to BODIPY unit (ETE~99.9&#8201;%). Ultrafast fluorescence and transient absorption spectroscopic studies of dyad&#8197;1 showed TAPP to BODIPY energy transfer in 125&#8197;fs (kET=8.0&#215;1012&#8201;s&#8722;1) which is one of the fastest energy transfer events in BODIPY based dyad reported so far. Whereas, in dyad&#8197;2, energy transfer is almost four times slower (480&#8197;fs, kET=2.1&#215;1012&#8201;s&#8722;1). These results were rationalized by theoretical F&#246;rster formulations. This study shows that suitably matched optical properties of TAPP and BODIPY dyes along with their easy syntheses will be the key to develop highly efficient energy transfer systems in future for multiple applications.

         <title>Synthesis of Contorted Polycyclic Aromatic Compounds via Alkyne Benzannulation on Zigzag&#8208;Edged Dibenzochrysene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report the use of alkyne benzannulation on zigzag&#8208;edged dibenzochrysene derivatives to extend the conjugation and reduce their bandgap. Unexpectedly, the ring closure reaction takes place at the most sterically hindered positions (peri to the substituent) to yield contorted polycyclic compounds. Moreover, both TIPS&#8208;acetylene&#8208;functionalized dibenzochrysene derivatives underwent a tandem dearomative spirocyclization to form bent polycyclic compounds.







Abstract
Organic dyes are interesting building blocks for the preparation of organic semiconductors as they possess synthetic handles that can be used to functionalize them and, consequently, change their electronic properties. However, reactions to extend their &#960;&#8208;conjugated framework through ring annulation have only been scarcely tested. Herein, we report the use of alkyne benzannulation on 2,8&#8208;dibromo&#8208;dibenzo[def,mno]chrysene (vat orange 3) and 2,9&#8208;dibromo&#8208;dibenzo[b,def]chrysene (vat orange 1) to extend the conjugation and reduce their bandgap. Unexpectedly, the ring closure reaction takes place at the most sterically hindered positions (peri to the substituent) to yield contorted polycyclic compounds. More surprisingly, both TIPS&#8208;acetylene&#8208;functionalized derivatives underwent a tandem dearomative spirocyclization to form bent polycyclic compounds. Absorption spectroscopy reveals that ring annulation on both 2,9&#8208;dibromo&#8208;dibenzo[b,def]chrysene and 2,8&#8208;dibromo&#8208;dibenzo[def,mno]chrysene resulted in a decrease of 0.38 and 0.12&#8197;eV in bandgap values, respectively, despite inducing a contorted conformation.

         <title>Heterogenization of Palladium Trimer and Nanoparticles Through Polymerization Boosted Catalytic Efficiencies in Recyclable Coupling and Reduction Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The palladium trimer functionalized polymers PSSy&#8208;[Pd3]+ (2) and their derived palladium nanoparticles (3) are synthesized by concise free radical polymerization method. They show much superior catalytic activities than their monomeric precursors in the SMCC and 4&#8208;nitrophenol reduction reactions. This work enlightens that the immobilization of tri&#8208;palladium clusters or nanoparticles by polymerization could offer multiple advantages in stability, efficiency and recyclability.







Abstract
The development of heterogeneous palladium catalysts has shown continuous vitality in the field of catalysis and materials. In this work, we report one concise free radical polymerization approach to accomplish the aromatic palladium trimer functionalized polymers PSSy&#8208;[Pd3]+ (2) and its derived palladium nanoparticles (3). Full characterizations could confirm the successful combination of cationic [Pd3]+ or nanoparticles with poly(p&#8208;sulfonated styrene) skeleton. Compared to their monomeric tri&#8208;palladium precursor (1) and common Pd(dba)2, Pd(PPh3)4, Pd(OAc)2, heterogeneous PSSy&#8208;[Pd3]+ (2) shows much superior catalytic activities (0.15&#8197;mol&#8201;%, TOF=1333.3&#8197;h&#8722;1) in the SMCC reaction. The identically ligated PdNPs (3) are formed in&#8208;suit in the presence of NaBH4 and accomplish quantitative reduction of 4&#8208;nitrophenol in just 320&#8197;s (0.50&#8197;mol&#8201;%, TOF=2250&#8197;h&#8722;1). Moreover, these heterogeneous catalysts are reused for 5&#8211;6 times without significant loss of catalytic activity. Their superior catalytic ability is probably attributed to the synergistic effect of polymer entanglement and the tri&#8208;palladium fragment. This work enlightens that the immobilization of palladium clusters or nanoparticles by polymerization could offer multiple advantages in stability, efficiency and recyclability for their involved catalyses and show far&#8208;reaching future implications.

         <title>Preferential Formation of Three&#8208;layered Host&#8211;Guest Complexes of a Planar Dinuclear Metallohost with Alkali Metal Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;layered 3&#8201;:&#8201;2 (host/guest) complexes were preferentially formed by the complexation of a dinuclear nickel(II) metallohost with larger alkali metal ions (K+, Rb+, Cs+), whereas 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 and 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 complexes were formed with Na+. The three&#8208;layered complexes have a unique structural feature with three chemically different environments due to the oppositely curved two [Ni(saloph)] moieties of the metallohost.







Abstract
We synthesized a planar macrocyclic dinuclear nickel(II) metallohost from the corresponding macrocyclic imine ligand containing two N2O2 chelate coordination sites and an O6 cation binding site like 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 as well as peripheral hexyl groups. Due to the lipophilic nature of the hexyl groups, the metallohost was soluble in less polar media where its interaction with alkali metal ions was enhanced. The binding studies by NMR spectroscopy clearly showed its strong tendency to form multi&#8208;layered structures. The metallohost formed 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 and 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 (host/guest) complexes with Na+ with the two&#8208;step binding constants of logK1=6.6 and logK2=3.0. In contrast, its complexation with larger alkali metal ions (K+, Rb+, Cs+) preferentially gave 3&#8201;:&#8201;2 (host/guest) complexes when 2/3 equiv. of the guest was present. The three&#8208;layered structures of these 3&#8201;:&#8201;2 complexes were well characterized by mass spectrometry and 2D COSY/ROESY experiments as well as DFT calculations, elucidating their unique structural feature with three chemically different environments due to the oppositely curved two [Ni(saloph)] moieties of the metallohost. Therefore, the three&#8208;layered structures were preferentially formed when larger alkali metal ions (K+, Rb+, Cs+) were complexed with the metallohost.

The three-layered complexes have a unique structural feature with three chemically different environments due to the oppositely curved two [Ni(saloph)] moieties of the metallohost.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We synthesized a planar macrocyclic dinuclear nickel(II) metallohost from the corresponding macrocyclic imine ligand containing two N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; chelate coordination sites and an O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; cation binding site like 18-crown-6 as well as peripheral hexyl groups. Due to the lipophilic nature of the hexyl groups, the metallohost was soluble in less polar media where its interaction with alkali metal ions was enhanced. The binding studies by NMR spectroscopy clearly showed its strong tendency to form multi-layered structures. The metallohost formed 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 and 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 (host/guest) complexes with Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; with the two-step binding constants of log&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=6.6 and log&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=3.0. In contrast, its complexation with larger alkali metal ions (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Rb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) preferentially gave 3&#8201;:&#8201;2 (host/guest) complexes when 2/3 equiv. of the guest was present. The three-layered structures of these 3&#8201;:&#8201;2 complexes were well characterized by mass spectrometry and 2D COSY/ROESY experiments as well as DFT calculations, elucidating their unique structural feature with three chemically different environments due to the oppositely curved two [Ni(saloph)] moieties of the metallohost. Therefore, the three-layered structures were preferentially formed when larger alkali metal ions (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Rb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) were complexed with the metallohost.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Manipulation of Supramolecular Chirality in Bicontinuous Networks of Bent&#8208;Shaped Polycatenar Dimers</title>

         <dc:description>
The subtle interplay between space filling and interhelix interaction of a new type of soft bent&#8208;core polycatenar molecules induces the spontaneous supramolecular chirality generation and removal upon alkyl chain volume expansion by the reformation of meso&#8208;structure Ia3d with tighter lattice.







Abstract
Bicontinuous cubic liquid crystalline (LC) phases are of particular interest due their possible applications in electronic devices and special supramolecular chirality. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of first examples of achiral bent&#8208;shaped polycatenar dimers, capable of displaying mirror symmetry breaking in their cubic and isotropic liquid phases. The molecules have a taper&#8208;shaped 3,4,5&#8208;trialkoxybenzoate segment connected to rod&#8208;like building unit terminated with one terminal flexible chain. The two segments were connected using an aliphatic spacer with seven methylene units to induce bending of the whole structure.

         <title>O&#8208;p&#8208;Methoxyphenyl &#945;&#8208;Hydroxycarboxylic Acids as Versatile Hydroxyalkylation Agents for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heteroatom&#8208;stabilized radicals are useful building blocks for photocatalysis. Despite the intensive research on &#945;&#8208;amino radicals, &#945;&#8208;hydroxy radicals have never received comparable attention. Herein we present O&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenyl (PMP) &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylic acids as easy to prepare, bench&#8208;stable and synthetically highly flexible radical precursors. Next to their synthesis, we describe their application in five different photocatalytic reactions.







Abstract
Reliable radical precursors are crucial for photocatalytic processes. In particular, heteroatom&#8208;stabilized radicals have attracted considerable research interest in photocatalysis. Among them, &#945;&#8208;amino radicals have received the most attention, while the research on &#945;&#8208;hydroxy radicals is much less developed. Herein, we present O&#8208;PMP &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylic acids as novel precursors for the formation of oxygen&#8208;stabilized radicals. These radicals have been successfully used as building blocks in Pd&#8208;catalyzed allylation reactions, Ni&#8208;catalyzed arylation and alkenylation reactions, and Giese reactions. A subsequent deprotection step liberates the corresponding hydroxyalkylation products.

         <title>Application of Advanced Microscopy Techniques to the Characterization of Mixed Matrix Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) are promising for separation processes due to their tunable properties and enhanced performance. This review covers the methodologies, challenges, and applications of characterizing MMMs using Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB&#8208;SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). It highlights the principles, challenges, and future directions in using these techniques to optimize MMMs for various applications.







Abstract
Mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) have emerged as promising materials for various separation processes due to their tunable properties, enhanced separation performance and reproducibility. In this review paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the methodologies, challenges, and applications associated with the characterization of MMMs using two advanced imaging techniques: Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB&#8208;SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). We begin by outlining the principles and capabilities of FIB&#8208;SEM and TEM, emphasizing their suitability for studying the microstructure, morphology, and composition of MMMs at nanoscale resolution. Subsequently, we discuss the specific challenges and limitations encountered in the characterization of MMMs using these techniques, including sample preparation, image acquisition, and data interpretation. Furthermore, we review the diverse applications of FIB&#8208;SEM and TEM in elucidating the structure&#8208;property relationships of MMMs. Through illustrative examples, we highlight the valuable insights gained from these imaging techniques in optimizing MMMs for various separation applications. Finally, we propose future directions and emerging trends in MMM characterization, including the integration of lasers into FIB&#8208;SEM and in&#8197;situ characterization techniques, to address current challenges and push the boundaries of MMM design and performance. Overall, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methodologies for characterizing MMMs using FIB&#8208;SEM and TEM, identifies key challenges, and offers insights into future research directions aimed at harnessing the full potential of MMMs for sustainable separation technologies.

         <title>Ionomeric Binders for High Temperature Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The binder materials is responsible for the mass transport of the catalyst layer for HT&#8208;PEMFCs. A detailed discussion of various binders with different molecular structures is described. In addition, we provide the development directions for different binders aiming at reducing the Pt loading and mitigating the PA poisoning.







Abstract
High&#8208;temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell (HT&#8208;PEMFC) based on phosphoric acid doped polybenzimidazole membrane (PBI/PA) operating at 120&#8211;200&#8201;&#176;C can provide insensitivity to carbon monoxide (CO) and simplified managements of water and heat and thus attract significant global attention. However, one significant drawback is its low utilization of precious metal catalysts resulted from the PA poisoning and inefficient three&#8208;phase boundary. Studies of binder materials in catalyst layers for HT&#8208;PEMFC are gradually emerging and there are few literature reviews on this important topic. The purpose of this review is to describe the various types of binders based on their molecular structure and electrochemical properties, with particular emphasis on catalyst layer for fuel cells. Importantly, this review provides a better understanding of relationship between fuel cell performance and the gas permeability and conductivity of different binders. Then, future directions of research and development in binder materials of HT&#8208;PEMFC are pointed out.

         <dc:description>
New redox&#8208;active diguanidines are prepared, with the aim to optimize their proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer properties. Then, their oxidized, dicationic redox states are applied in dehydrogenative coupling reactions, with radical cation (electron transfer) or arenium&#8208;ion like (proton transfer) mechanisms. The molecules emerge as valuable (and in some cases superior) alternatives to traditionally applied benzoquinones such as DDQ.







Abstract
Dehydrogenative coupling (DC) reactions are of importance for the construction of new carbon&#8208;element bonds in synthetic organic chemistry. In this work, we report on the synthesis and characterization of several redox&#8208;active guanidino&#8208;functionalized aromatic molecules (GFAs) for use in DC (C&#8722;C and C&#8722;O) reactions. In a systematic approach, we first characterize the new DC reagents in all relevant redox and protonation states, and compare their performance in competitive test proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions. Then, their use in four different DC reactions with different mechanisms is evaluated.

         <title>Widening the Stimuli&#8208;Responsiveness of Aqueous Biphasic Systems by Changing the Ionic Liquid Cation Basicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we demonstrate the formation of novel stimuli&#8208;responsive aqueous biphasic systems (ABS), able to respond simultaneously to temperature and pH, or just to one stimulus. This was achieved with ABS formed by mono or dicationic protic ionic liquids as phase&#8208;forming components, being defined by the ionic liquid cation chemical structure or its basicity, presenting high impact in the design of more sustainable separation processes.







Abstract
Herein we demonstrate the formation of new stimuli&#8208;responsive aqueous biphasic systems (ABS), able to respond simultaneously to temperature and pH, or just to one stimulus, therefore allowing the design of more sustainable separation processes. This dual behavior is achieved with ABS formed by mono&#8208; or dicationic protic ionic liquids as phase&#8208;forming components, being defined by the ionic liquid cation chemical structure or its basicity. While ABS comprising monocationic ionic liquids only respond to the effect of temperature, systems comprising dicationic ionic liquids are simultaneously affected by both temperature and pH variations. Dicationic ionic liquids are here identified as the key to unlock a double response to stimuli, which is due to the presence of two pKa values afforded by the cation. The reported findings contribute to increase the customizability of double stimuli&#8208;responsive ABS based on ionic liquids, whose development was up to date limited to ionic liquids bearing pH&#8208;responsive anions, opening the door towards the development of more sustainable separation processes.

         <title>Bispecific Thio&#8208;linked Disaccharides as Inhibitors of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Lectins LecA (PA&#8208;IL) and LecB (PA&#8208;IIL): Dual&#8208;Targeting Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a prevalent opportunistic human pathogen, particularly associated with cystic fibrosis. Among its virulence factors are the LecA and LecB lectins. Both lectins play an important role in the adhesion to the host cells and display cytotoxic activity. In this study, we successfully synthesized hardly hydrolysable carbohydrate ligands targeting these pathogenic lectins, including two bispecific glycans. The interactions between LecA/LecB lectins and synthetic glycans were evaluated using hemagglutination (yeast agglutination) inhibition assays, comparing their efficacy with corresponding monosaccharides. Additionally, the binding affinities of bispecific glycans were assessed using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Structural insight into the lectin&#8208;ligand interaction was obtained by determining the crystal structures of LecA/LecB lectins in complex with one of the bispecific ligands using X ray crystallography. This comprehensive investigation into the inhibitory potential of synthetic glycosides against P. aeruginosa lectins sheds light on their potential application in antimicrobial therapy.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The development of stable high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type organic semiconductors for applications in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) under ambient conditions is desirable but challenging. To address this issue, we here synthesized a series of functionalized&#8208;phenanthrene conjugated asymmetric N&#8208;heteroacenes, where the phenanthrene moiety was modified by N substitution or Br functionalization at different positions to induce various degrees of asymmetry in their structures. The photophysical and electrochemical properties of these molecules were studied, and their packing patterns were analysed. The OFETs based on these materials were fabricated through simple spin&#8208;coating method, and the as&#8208;resulted thin films were treated with different conditions. The devices exhibit typical n&#8208;type performances under ambient conditions with charge carrier mobilities up to 4.27 &#215; 10&#8208;3 cm2&#160;V&#8208;1&#160;s&#8208;1. The crystallinities and morphologies of these thin films were studied to investigate the correlations between the device performances and thin&#8208;film characteristics. Our study suggests that phenanthrene conjugated N&#8208;heteroacenes can be developed as promising air&#8208;stable solution&#8208;processable n&#8208;type semiconducting materials, and Br modification at certain positions of phenanthrene is beneficial in adjusting the thin&#8208;film properties for the improvement of OFET performances.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Electrolyte for Electrosynthesis: Scalable Anodically&#8208;Enabled One&#8208;Pot Sequence from Aldehyde to Isoxazol(in)es</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free one&#8208;pot electrochemical synthetic strategy, involving &#8220;in&#8208;situ electrolyte&#8221; generation, was developed. The concept of &#8220;in&#8208;situ electrolyte&#8221; for electrochemical transformations was demonstrated for the waste&#8208;reducing and cost&#8208;effective synthesis of high&#8208;value functionalized isoxazol(in)es. Chemical yields of up to 97&#8201;% are observed for a broad substrate scope.







Abstract
Electrochemical transformations are considered a green alternative to classical redox chemistry as it eliminates the necessity for toxic and waste producing redox reagents. Typical electrochemical reactions require the addition of a supporting electrolyte &#8211; an ionic compound to facilitate reaction medium conductivity. However, this is often accompanied by an increase in the amount of produced waste. Here, we report an &#8220;in&#8208;situ electrolyte&#8221; concept for facile, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, additive&#8208;free one&#8208;pot electrochemical preparation of isoxazol(in)es, important scaffolds for biologically active natural and synthetic molecules, from the respective aldehydes. The protocol utilizes no halogenated solvents and no external oxidants, while salt side&#8208;products provide the ionic conductivity necessary for the electrosynthesis. The electrolysis is performed in an undivided cell, using the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrodes for the chlor&#8208;alkali industry dimensionally stable and scalable mixed metal oxide anode and platinized titanium cathode of high durability. The cascade transformation comprises the condensation of aldehyde to oxime followed by its anodic oxidation and subsequent intra&#8208; and/or intermolecular [3+2] cycloadditions with an appropriate dipolarophile. Chemical yields up to 97&#8201;%, and good Faradaic efficiency, scalability, and stability are observed for most substrates in a broad scope.

         <title>Hybrid Supports for Oligonucleotide Synthesis: Controlled Pore Glass Derivatives with Branched Amine&#8208;Ended Polyether or Polyimine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlled pore glass (CPG), differing in pore size and subsequent specific surface, was chemically modified by: (1) increasing surface susceptibility for amine functionalization via reaction with oxirane&#8208;type (active) and alkyl/aryl&#8208;type (inactive towards amine compounds) silane pro&#8208;adhesive compounds, and (2) immobilization of trimethylolpropane tris[poly(propylene glycol), amine terminated] ether, comb&#8208;like 8&#8208;arm octa[poly(ethylene glycol) amine] with each branch amine terminated, and a poly(propylene imine) amine&#8208;terminated second&#8208;generation dendrimer. The increase in surface density of amine functions&#8212;monitored by UV&#8208;Vis technique adopted for quantitative measurements of Ruhemann&#8217;s purple intensity&#8212;improved final loading capacity, characterized by dimethoxytrityl cation absorption. Obtained materials proved their applicability in automatic oligonucleotide (ON) synthesis, especially when silanized 2000 &#197; CPG modified with 8&#8208;arm octa[poly(ethylene glycol) amine], with deduced empirical formula CPG&#8212;silane&#8212;(NH)5.7PEG&#8208;(NH2)2.3, was used for long&#8208;chain (150 nucleotides) ONs synthesis. This can be regarded as a good CPG support for this purpose. Moreover, hybrid supports with different porosity allowed the synthesis of shorter ONs with satisfactory yield and purity, monitored by RP&#8208;HPLC and MALDI&#8208;TOF. On the molecular level, two competitive mechanisms seem to influence the utility of the final hybrid support: spatial availability of active sites and the propensity of the functionalizer to bond with the CPG surface.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Controlled pore glass (CPG), differing in pore size and subsequent specific surface, was chemically modified by: (1) increasing surface susceptibility for amine functionalization via reaction with oxirane-type (active) and alkyl/aryl-type (inactive towards amine compounds) silane pro-adhesive compounds, and (2) immobilization of trimethylolpropane tris[poly(propylene glycol), amine terminated] ether, comb-like 8-arm octa[poly(ethylene glycol) amine] with each branch amine terminated, and a poly(propylene imine) amine-terminated second-generation dendrimer. The increase in surface density of amine functions&#8212;monitored by UV-Vis technique adopted for quantitative measurements of Ruhemann&#8217;s purple intensity&#8212;improved final loading capacity, characterized by dimethoxytrityl cation absorption. Obtained materials proved their applicability in automatic oligonucleotide (ON) synthesis, especially when silanized 2000 &#197; CPG modified with 8-arm octa[poly(ethylene glycol) amine], with deduced empirical formula CPG&#8212;silane&#8212;(NH)5.7PEG-(NH2)2.3, was used for long-chain (150 nucleotides) ONs synthesis. This can be regarded as a good CPG support for this purpose. Moreover, hybrid supports with different porosity allowed the synthesis of shorter ONs with satisfactory yield and purity, monitored by RP-HPLC and MALDI-TOF. On the molecular level, two competitive mechanisms seem to influence the utility of the final hybrid support: spatial availability of active sites and the propensity of the functionalizer to bond with the CPG surface.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Switch of Five Contiguous Chiral Centers in the Synthesis of Both Enantiomers of Hajos&#8211;Parrish Ketone Analogs via Diphenylprolinol Silyl Ether&#8208;Mediated Domino Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Both enantiomers of functionalized Hajos&#8211;Parrish ketone (HPK) analogs were prepared with excellent diastereoselectivities and enantioselectivities using the same chiral catalyst under two slightly different conditions. In condition A, dioxane was used as the solvent with 3 equivalents of water. In condition B, acetonitrile was used as the solvent with 30 equivalents of water, followed by epimerization with a base in a one&#8208;pot. The reaction consisted of a domino reaction including a diphenylprolinol silyl ether&#8211;mediated asymmetric Michael reaction and an intramolecular Henry reaction. In the Michael reaction, depending on the solvent and water amounts, syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;isomers were selectively synthesized with excellent enantioselectivity, in which the absolute configuration at C5 (indanone numbering) was opposite. The subsequent Henry reaction was diastereoselective, in which the C5 substituent controlled the three chiral centers in a highly diastereoselective manner. The final base treatment in condition B caused epimerization, changing the stereochemistry at C6. Switching more than two chiral centers with high enantioselectivity is extremely difficult using the same chiral catalyst; the present reaction is a very rare enantiodivergent reaction that switches five continuous chiral centers with high enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Design and Evaluation of Azaspirocycles as RNA binders</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study presents efficient synthetic pathways for preparing novel azaspirocycles. These methodologies involve functionalizing key bicyclic hydrazines with a substituent on one of their bridgehead carbon atoms. The desired spirocyclic cores were successfully obtained through double reductive amination reactions, intramolecular cyclizations, and cleavages of the N&#8208;N bond. The isolated molecules possess unique three&#8208;dimensional structures, suggesting potential applications in medicinal chemistry and drug discovery. With the growing interest in targeting nucleic acids as a complementary approach to protein&#8208;targeting strategies for developing novel active compounds, we investigated the potential of the synthesized azaspirocycles as RNA binders. As a proof of concept, we highlight the promising activity of some compounds as strong binders of HIV&#8208;1 TAR RNA and inhibitors of Tat/TAR interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>A Nanosized {NiII18} Cluster with a &#8216;Flying Saucer&#8217; Topology Exhibiting Slow Relaxation of Magnetisation Phenomena at Both 15 K and 1.3 K</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A high&#8208;nuclearity {Ni18} complex (1) with a unique &#8216;flying saucer&#8217; motif has been prepared from the organic chelate, &#945;&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridine&#8208;methanol (mpmH), in conjunction with bridging azido (N3&#8208;) and peroxido (O22&#8208;) ligands. Magnetic susceptibility measurements revealed the presence of both ferro&#8208; and antiferromagnetic exchange interactions between the metal centres in 1, and the stabilization of spin states with appreciable S values at two different temperature regimes. The end&#8208;on bridging azido and alkoxido groups are in all likelyhood the ferromagnetic mediators, while the &#951;3:&#951;3:&#956;6&#8208;bridging peroxides most likely promote the antiparallel alignment of the metals&#8217; spin vectors, yielding an overall non&#8208;zero spin ground state for the centrosymmetric compound 1. Furthermore, the {Ni18} nanosized cluster behaves as a single&#8208;molecule magnet, exhibiting magnetic hysteresis at low temperatures and two relaxation processes at 15 K and 1.3 K, a very rare phenomenon in polynuclear magnetic 3d&#8208;metal clusters.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Luminescent Terpyridine&#8208;Based Metallo&#8208;Bowties with Alkyl Chain&#8208;Bridged Dimerized Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Numerous metallo&#8208;supramolecules with well&#8208;defined sizes and shapes have been successfully constructed via the strong coordination interaction between terpyridine (TPY) moieties and ruthenium cations. However, the pseudo&#8208;octahedral geometry of &lt;TPY&#8208;Ru&#8208;TPY&gt; unit hampers the luminescent properties of such metallo&#8208;architectures, thus limiting their applications as optical materials. To address this issue, we herein use a flexible alkyl chain to bridge TPY building blocks, replacing conventional &lt;TPY&#8208;Ru&#8208;TPY&gt; linkage. The introduction of alkyl chain guides the self&#8208;assembly into desired architecture while simultaneously eliminating the quenching effects typically associated with the &lt;TPY&#8208;Ru&#8208;TPY&gt; linkage. More importantly, this design strategy enables the precise construction of bowtie&#8208;shaped metallo&#8208;supramolecules with significantly enhanced emission. The incorporation of alkyl chain linkage not only maintains structural integrity but also enhances optical performance, making these metallo&#8208;supramolecular assemblies highly promising for applications in advanced photonic and luminescent materials. This study offers a versatile approach to construct complex metallo&#8208;supramolecular architectures with desired optical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Quenching Rate Constants of Lewis Base&#8208;Boryl Radical by Substrates: a Laser Flash Photolysis Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The advanced strategy using  Lewis base&#8208;boryl radicals (LBRs) has recently been proposed for the addition of alkyl substituents to the full&#8208;carbon quaternary center of an organic molecule. However, as the rate&#8208;determining step in the whole route, reaction rate constants of LBRs with substrates are extremely lacking. In this paper, 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP)&#8208;BH2&#8226; was selected as a representative of LBRs, and its reactions with six monochloro&#8208;substituted substrates, including three methyl chlorobenzoates and three chlorinated acetanilides were studied in experiments and theoretical calculations. The bimolecular reaction rate constants, kq, were determined using laser flash photolysis approach. By comparing activation energies along the two addition pathways, we have clarified the rate&#8208;determining step as the attacking to carbonyl oxygen instead of chlorine atom. Furthermore, noncovalent interaction (NCI) analyses on these substrates indicate that weak interactions, such as hydrogen&#8208;bonding and van der Waals interactions, have significant influence on the reactivity of these substrates. Our study provides concrete clues to extend this synthetic strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;step Macrocycle&#8208;to&#8208;Macrocycle Conversion Towards Two New Macrocyclic Arenes with Different Structures and Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two new macrocyclic arenes H1 and H2 were conveniently synthesized by the one&#8208;step reaction of carboxylic acid substituted octopus[3]arene. It was found that H1 was composed of three ethenoanthracene subunits with a rigid hexagonal structure and H2 contained two ethenoanthracene subunits and one anthracene subunit with a rigid house&#8208;shaped structure. Among them, H2 exhibited strong blue fluorescence due to the existence of an anthracene subunit. Moreover, both H1 and H2 showed large and electron&#8208;rich cavities, which enable them to effectively complex different nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocyclic salt guests in solution and the solid state. It was further found that H2 exhibited stronger complexation towards the tested guests than H1 probably due to the stronger charge&#8208;transfer interactions between H2 and the guests.</dc:description>

         <title>Isoreticular Contraction in Dicopper Paddle&#8208;Wheel&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks to Enhance C2H2/CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving a balance between high selectivity and uptake is a formidable challenge for the purification of acetylene from mixtures with carbon dioxide, particularly when seeking to maximize both C2H2 adsorption capacity and C2H2/CO2 separation selectivity in crystalline porous materials. In this study, leveraging the principles of reticular chemistry, we selected two tetracarboxylate&#8208;based linkers and combined them with Cu2+ ions to synthesize two isoreticular dicopper paddle&#8208;wheel&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs): Cu&#8208;TPTC (terphenyl&#8208;3,3&#8217;,5,5&#8217;&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid , H4TPTC) and Cu&#8208;ABTC (3,3,5,5&#8208;azobenzenetetracarboxylic acid, H4ABTC). The structural and sorption analyses revealed that Cu&#8208;ABTC, despite having slightly smaller pores due to the strategic replacement of a phenyl ring with an azo group between two tetratopic ligands, maintains high porosity compared to Cu&#8208;TPTC. Furthermore, Cu&#8208;ABTC outperforms Cu&#8208;TPTC in terms of C2H2 adsorption capacity (196 cm3 g&#8208;1 at 298 K and 1 bar) and C2H2/CO2 separation selectivity (16.5~5.6). These findings were corroborated by dynamic breakthrough experiments and computational modeling. This research highlights the potential of the isoreticular contraction strategy in enhancing MOFs for sophisticated gas adsorption and separation processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Basics and Advances of Manganese&#8208;Based Cathode Materials for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is greatly crucial to develop low&#8208;cost energy storage candidates with high safety and stability to replace alkali metal systems for a sustainable future. Recently, aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have received tremendous interest owing to their low cost, high safety, wide oxidation states, and sophisticated fabrication process. Nanostructured manganese (Mn)&#8208;based oxides in different polymorphs are the potential cathode materials for the widespread application of ZIBs. However, Mn&#8208;based oxide materials suffer from several drawbacks, such as low electronic/ionic conductivity and poor cycling performance. To overcome these issues, various structural modification strategies have been adopted to enhance their electrochemical activity, including phase/defect engineering, doping with foreign atoms (e.g., metal and/or nonmetal atoms), and coupling with carbon materials or conducting polymers. Herein, this review targets to summarize the advantages and disadvantages of the above&#8208;mentioned strategies to improve the electrochemical performance of the cathodic part of ZIBs. The challenges and suggestions for the development of manganese oxides for ZIBs are put forward.</dc:description>

         <title>Streamlining Thionyl Tetrafluoride (SOF4) and Pentafluoro&#8208;Oxosulfate [OSF5]&#8722; Anions Syntheses</title>

         <dc:description>
SuF&#8208;ficiently. The preparation of 100&#8197;mmol of thionyl tetrafluoride (SOF4) by the direct S&#8722;F bond formation from fluorine (F2) and thionyl fluoride (SOF2) was achieved in a quantitative and convenient manner. The solid&#8208;state structure was elucidated, and the reagent fully characterized. This efficient SuFEx reagent was transformed using a fluoride salt in pentafluorooxosulfate (OSF5) anion that can behave as an SOF4 storage reagent. Tuning the solvent system, the stable OSF5 anion appears as reactive as SOF4 for the formation of sulfurimidoyl fluorides.







Abstract
A one pot room temperature synthesis of thionyl tetrafluoride (SOF4) from elemental fluorine (F2) and thionyl fluoride (SOF2) is reported. The selective decagram scale process (100&#8197;mmol) allows a quantitative preparation of SOF4 with high purity. The solid&#8208;state structure has also been elucidated and compared with the reported gas phase one. The use of this reagent for the formation of the emerging pentafluorooxosulfate [cat][OSF5] anions led to the preparation of multiple ion&#8208;pairs (cat=Ag, NEt3Me, PPN, PPh4) in different organic solvents. The SuFEx reservoir ability of this anion was studied and by tuning the solvent system, the reactivity of pure thionyl tetrafluoride was observed using Ag[OSF5] in THF and acetone.

         <title>Size&#8208;Dependent Copper Nanoparticles Supported on Carbon Nanotubes with Balanced Cu+ and Cu0 Dual Sites for the Selective Hydrogenation of Ethylene Carbonate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu nanoparticles supported on surface modified carbon nanotubes with defects and oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups catalysts were prepared via a convenient impregnation method. The 40Cu/CNTs catalysts revealed remarkable methanol and ethylene glycol yields for the vapor&#8208;phase hydrogenation of ethylene carbonate. The synergistic effect of Cu0 and Cu+ dual sites contributed to the satisfactory catalytic performance of ethylene carbonate hydrogenation.







Abstract
Cyclic carbonate hydrogenation offers an alternative for the efficient indirect CO2 utilization. In this study, a series of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) supported xCu/CNTs catalysts with different Cu loadings were fabricated using a convenient impregnation method, and exhibited excellent catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of ethylene carbonate to methanol and ethylene glycol. The structural and physicochemical properties revealed that acid treatment of CNTs resulted in plentiful oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups, providing sufficient anchoring sites for copper species. The calcination process conducted under an inert atmosphere resulted in the formation of ternary CuO, Cu2O, and Cu composites, enhancing the metal&#8208;support interaction and facilitating the formation of balanced Cu0 and Cu+ dual sites as well as high active surface area after reduction. Contributed to the synergetic effect of balanced Cu+ and Cu0 species proved by density functional theory calculation and the electron&#8208;rich CNTs surface, the 40Cu/CNTs catalyst achieved strengthened catalytic performance with methanol yield of 83&#8201;%, ethylene glycol yield of 99&#8201;% at ethylene carbonate conversion of &gt;99&#8201;%, and 150&#8197;h of long&#8208;term running stability. Consequently, CNTs supported Cu serve as efficient non&#8208;silica based catalyst for ester hydrogenation.

The precise and accurate location of the hydrogen atoms in different B&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Li linkages in three lithium m&#8208;terphenylhydridoborates was determined by Hirshfeld atom refinement (HAR) of standard single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of the lithium m&#8208;terphenylhydridoborates [Li(2,6&#8208;Mes2C6H3)BH3]2 (1), Li(2,6&#8208;Mes2C6H3)2BH2 (2) and Li(OEt2)(2,6&#8208;Mes2C6H3)2BH2 (3) are reported. Hirshfeld Atom Refinement (HAR) of the experimentally obtained molecular structures by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography allowed the determination of the exact positions of the hydrogen atoms. The bond situations of the various B&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Li linkages were investigated by a complementary bonding analysis using various methods including atoms in molecules (AIM), electron localizability indicator (ELI&#8722;D), non&#8208;covalent interaction (NCI) index and the compliance matrix.

         <title>Secondary Sphere Lewis Acid Activated Heme Superoxo Adducts Mimic Crucial Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions in IDO/TDO Heme Dioxygenases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heme superoxide model compound with secondary coordination sphere Lewis acid activation has been utilized for the rational mimicking of reaction mechanism of the therapeutically relevant IDO/TDO dioxygenase enzymes. Therein, a distinct reaction precursor complex has been characterized, drawing potential parallels to the analogous ternary complex of IDO/TDO dioxygenases.







Abstract
Heme enzymes play a central role in a medley of reactivities within a wide variety of crucial biological systems. Their active sites are highly decorated with pivotal evolutionarily optimized non&#8208;covalent interactions that precisely choreograph their biological functionalities with specific regio&#8208;, stereo&#8208;, and chemo&#8208;selectivities. Gaining a clear comprehension of how such weak interactions within the active sites control reactivity offers powerful information to be implemented into the design of future therapeutic agents that target these heme enzymes. To shed light on such critical details pertaining to tryptophan dioxygenating heme enzymes, this study investigates the indole dioxygenation reactivities of Lewis acid&#8208;activated heme superoxo model systems, wherein an unprecedented kinetic behavior is revealed. In that, the activated heme superoxo adduct is observed to undergo indole dioxygenation with the intermediacy of a non&#8208;covalently organized precursor complex, which forms prior to the rate&#8208;limiting step of the overall reaction landscape. Spectroscopic and theoretical characterization of this precursor complex draws close parallels to the ternary complex of heme dioxygenases, which has been postulated to be of crucial importance for successful 2,3&#8208;dioxygenative cleavage of indole moieties.

         <title>Comparison of Different Organometallics Towards Electrophilic Aromatic 211At&#8208;Astatinations of Highly Reactive Tetrazines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrophilic 211At&#8208;labeling of trimethylsilanes, &#8208;germanes, or &#8211;stannanes was investigated on 5 different tetrazine structures. All 211At&#8208;labeled tetrazines could be labeled in radiochemical conversions of 60&#8211;90&#8201;%. Organotin proved to have the highest reactivity, however organogermanium and &#8208;silicon precursors were clearly advantaged as additional deprotection steps could avoided.







Abstract
Organometallics can be used as precursors for electrophilic 211At&#8208;statinations. In this report, we compared the potential of aryl trimethylsilanes, &#8208;germanes, or &#8211;stannanes to be used as precursors to 211At&#8208;label highly reactive tetrazines. Tetrazines can be used for pretargeted radioligand therapies or be applied as synthons to radiolabel rapidly and orthogonally a broad set of precursors such as peptides, mAbs or nanomedicines. All precursors could successfully be synthesized and radiolabeled. The reactivity of organogermanium reagents ranged between those of respective organotin and organosilicon precursors. Moreover, organogermanium reagents proved promising for accessing more complex and polar tetrazine scaffolds. In contrast to organotin derivatives, the use of protecting groups could be avoided for organogermanium and &#8208;silicon precursors. The developed 211At&#8208;labeled tetrazines could be labeled in radiochemical conversions of 60&#8211;90&#8201;%. Organogermanium and &#8208;silicon precursors were clearly advantaged as additional deprotection steps could avoided. Reported labeling procedures allow astatinations of highly reactive tetrazines to be used for pretargeted approaches or to applied as highly reactive synthons to label the next&#8208;generation of 211At&#8208;labeled radiopharmaceuticals.

         <title>Nitrate&#8208;Anion&#8208;Induced Formation of a 2D Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with an Unconventional Kagom&#233; Lattice Exhibiting Methanol&#8208;Mediated Ketone Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
This study presents a synthesis of a stable 2D MOF with an unconventional kagom&#233; lattice, namely, [Na0.33Co(L)(CH3OH)2](NO3)0.33 via nitrate anion recognition using a multifunctional phosphonato&#8208;amino&#8208;carboxylate ligand. This kagom&#233; lattice is efficient for the &#945;&#8208;methoxymethylation and aminomethylation of aromatic ketones, which can be in&#8208;situ exfoliated into one layer MOF nanosheets under catalytic reaction conditions.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with kagom&#233; lattice are attractive for their unique physical and chemical properties, but little attention has been paid to their catalytic properties. Herein, we report a 2D MOF based on a phosphonato&#8208;amino&#8208;carboxylate ligand (NaHL), i.&#8201;e., [Na0.33Co(L)(CH3OH)2](NO3)0.33 (2), which exhibits an unconventional kagom&#233; lattice. The formation of this kagom&#233; lattice is caused by the selective recognition of the NO3&#8722; anion by the phenolato group of L2&#8722; as evidenced by theoretical calculations. Compound 2 can be utilized for the &#945;&#8208;methoxymethylation and aminomethylation of aromatic ketones using methanol as a C1 source. Interestingly, compound 2 can be exfoliated in&#8208;situ into nanosheets with one&#8208;layer thickness under catalytic reaction conditions, which improves the catalytic efficiency. Based on the results of experiments and theoretical calculations, we proposed possible pathways for the catalytic reaction.

         <title>Unprecedented Cubic Mesomorphic Behaviour of Crown&#8208;Ether Functionalized Amphiphilic Cyclodextrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crown&#8208;ether&#8208;functionalized amphiphilic &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrins have been shown for the first time to form thermotropic bicontinuous cubic mesophases without relying on other mesogenic groups, uncover a simple and practical strategy to alter the phase behavior of macrocyclic supramolecular liquid crystals via the tuning of the volume fractions of the hydrophilic domains of the mesogens. Solid&#8208;state NMR studies revealed such materials to conduct Li+ ion transport with a very low activation energy.







Abstract
Amphiphilic supramolecular materials based on biodegradable cyclodextrins (CDs) have been known to self&#8208;assemble into different types of thermotropic liquid crystals, including smectic and hexagonal columnar mesophases. Previous studies on amphiphilic CDs bearing 14 aliphatic chains at the secondary face and 7 oligoethylene glycol (OEG) chains at the primary face showed that the stability of the mesophase can be rationally tuned through implementation of terminal functional groups to the OEG chains. Here, we report the syntheses of first examples of crown ether&#8208;functionalized amphiphilic cyclodextrins that unexpectedly form thermotropic bicontinuous cubic phases. This constitutes the first reported examples of cyclodextrins forming such phases, which are potentially capable of 3D ion transport. Lithium composites were made to assess lithium conduction in the material. XRD revealed the added lithium salt destabilizes the cubic phase in favour of the smectic phase. Solid&#8208;state NMR studies showed that these materials conduct lithium ions with a very low activation energy.

Lithium composites were made to assess lithium conduction in the material. XRD revealed the added lithium salt destabilizes the cubic phase in favour of the smectic phase. Solid-state NMR studies showed that these materials conduct lithium ions with a very low activation energy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anisotropic Porosity and Interface Synergy Enhanced Gas Permselectivity in Heterolayer Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Membrane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anisotropic heterolayer metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) membrane, composed of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 and ZIF&#8208;8, is synthesized using a sequential growth strategy. The membrane's pore anisotropy (ranging from 3.4 to 6&#8197;&#197;) and a distinct MOF&#8208;MOF interface with chemically crosslinked pores demonstrate enhanced CO2/N2 permselectivity compared to the performance of individual MOF membranes.







Abstract
The pursuit of sustainable, carbon&#8208;free separation technology hinges on the efficient separation of gas mixtures with high separation factors and flow rates, i.&#8201;e. high permselectivity. However, achieving this objective is arduous due to the meticulous engineering at the angstrom scale and intricate chemical manipulation required to design the pores within membranes. To address this challenge, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for an anisotropic porous membrane has been devised. Employing a meticulous step&#8208;by&#8208;step methodology, two distinct porous metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are integrated to form a monolithic anisotropic membrane. By harnessing pore anisotropy (3.4 to 6&#8197;&#197;) aligned with the gas permeation direction and a unique interface characterized by cross&#8208;linked pores derived from the two distinct MOFs, this membrane transcends the performance limitations inherent in the individual MOF membranes (~45&#8201;% enhanced selectivity). This approach not only sheds light on the heterolayer membrane design strategy but also elucidates the intricate CO2/N2 permselectivity relationship inherent in the interface structure.

Abstract
The reduction of CO2 has become a key role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in efforts to search for long&#8208;term responses to climate change. We report a couple of CO2&#8208;reducing molecular catalysts based on earth&#8208;abundant copper complexes. These are [Cu(DPA)(PyNAP)] (1) and [Cu(DPA)(PyQl)] (2) (where, DPA=pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxylate, PyNAP=2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthyridine, and PyQl=2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)quinoline). The copper metal&#8208;catalysed 2&#8208;electron reduction of CO2 to CO in the presence of 2&#8208;protons is challenging. These catalysts exhibit the production of CO gas in DMF/water mixtures, achieving an impressive Faradaic efficiency of 84&#8201;% and 72&#8201;% for complex 1 and 2 at &#8722;1.7&#8197;V vs. SCE, respectively, for selective CO2 reduction. The production of H2 due to 2H++2e&#8722; was also observed as a byproduct through the competitive proton reduction reaction. This was cross&#8208;verified by online gas and mass analysis. A comprehensive series of electrochemical experiments have substantiated the homogeneous behaviour exhibited by these molecular electrocatalysts. Our investigations confirmed the stability of the electrocatalysts under the electrocatalytic conditions. The mechanistic pathways were proposed to work with the EECC and ECEC (E: electrochemical and C: chemical) mechanisms. A CO2 insertion into an in&#8208;situ generated hydride from the Cu&#8208;center generates CO through the favourable path. This critical path kinetically favors excess Faradaic efficiency in 1 than 2, which agrees with the computational investigation.

         <title>C(sp2)&#8208;Arylsulfones Directly from Arylsulfonyl Chlorides with Boronic Acids by Photoactivation of Boosted EDA Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With a reinforced EDA complex platform, the visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated synthesis of C(sp2)&#8208;arylsulfones directly from commercially available arylsulfonyl chlorides and boronic acids at room temperature under photocatalyst&#8208;free conditions was demonstrated, featuring broad substrate scopes, simple operation, accessibility of raw materials and ease of scale&#8208;up.







Abstract
Directly with arylsulfonyl chlorides, a green and efficient deborylativesulfonylation of aryl(alkenyl)boronic acids has been developed to access both diarylsulfones and vinylarylsulfones in moderate to excellent yields at room temperature under visible&#8208;light irradiation. This protocol features broad C(sp2)&#8208;arylsulfone applicability, simple operation, accessibility of raw materials and ease of scale&#8208;up. The key to the success of this photoredox transformation is introducing catalytic amounts of additives, naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ols, thus boosting the formed electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes, which can dramatically improve not only the reaction efficiency but also the selectivity. This strategy was inspired and derived from specific substrates, representing a rare paradigm of how to exploit a more general reaction system. Moreover, extensive control experiments provide insights into the proposed mechanism.

3.4&#8201;times more active than the natural product: The tosyl group plays an important role in the synthesis of the enantiopure tosyl&#8208;samroiyotmycin A and its antimalarial activity. The synthetic strategy also gains access to a library of analogues. Antimalarial activity tests reveal promising results and provide insight into structure activity relationships.







Abstract
A total synthesis of the enantiopure syn,syn&#8208;tosyl&#8208;samroiyotmycin A, a C2&#8208;symmetric 20&#8208;membered antimalarial macrodiolide with syn,syn&#8208;configuration of the 8,24&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;9,25&#8208;dimethyl units and it's enantiopure anti,anti&#8208;derivative is described. The synthesis was accomplished utilizing a linear approach in 7 steps and 3&#8201;% overall yield via a sequence of diastereoselective methylation of SuperQuat oxazolidinone auxiliary, cross metathesis and Yamaguchi macrolactonization of fully functionalized seco&#8208;acids. By a similar approach we gained access to several samroiyotmycin analogues and precursors. Antimalarial activity was tested on multi&#8208;resistant (K1) and sensitive (Nf54) P.&#8197;falciparum strains providing insight into structure activity relationships. Both tosyl&#8208;oxazol unit as well as the syn&#8208;configuration of the two contiguous stereogenic centers turned out to be beneficial for antiplasmodial activity. For instance, syn,syn&#8208;tosyl&#8208;samroiyotmycin A showed 3.4 times higher activities than the &#8220;tosyl&#8208;free&#8221; natural product.

         <title>Enhancing the Chemical Stability of P12L24 Cage: Transformation of the Chemically Labile Imine Cage into a Robust Carbamate Cage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report enhancement in chemical stability of the imine&#8208;based porphyrinic cage P12L24 by converting it into a robust carbamate porphyrinic cage, c&#8208;P12L24, through a two&#8208;step post&#8208;synthetic modification process. First, the imine bonds in P12L24 were reduced to form an amine&#8208;based cage, r&#8208;P12L24, followed by carbamation using N,N&#8242;&#8208;carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) to yield c&#8208;P12L24. The resulting carbamate cage exhibits high stability under acidic and basic conditions (pH 1&#8211;13) and in the presence of moisture. 1H NMR, DOSY NMR, and DFT calculations revealed that reducing the imine bonds to amine increases the framework&#8217;s flexibility, causing partial structural collapse, whereas the carbamate formation restores structural rigidity. The insertion of a 4.0 nm molecular ruler into the cavity of zinc&#8208;metallated c&#8208;P12L24 via metal&#8208;ligand coordination further confirmed restoration of the cavity size and geometry of the original cage. This enhancement of chemical stability through carbamate formation can pave the way to a wide range of potential applications for the gigantic porphyrinic cage.</dc:description>

         <title>Flipping&#160;the Metalation of 4&#8208;Dimethylaminopyridine: Steric Repulsion versus&#160;London Dispersion Attraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;covalent interactions, including the coordination of an organolithium reagent by a directing group and the steric hindrance from substituents, play a crucial role in determining the selectivity of metalation reactions. Here, we demonstrate the effective utilization of steric interactions for &#8220;flipping&#8221; the lithiation of 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). Introduction of a Me3Si substituent to the position 1 of DMAP or simple complexation with t&#8208;BuLi allows selective C3&#8208;lithiation, due to the steric hindrance of a C2&#8208;H bond by the bulky moiety at the pyridine nitrogen. This simple approach creates a convenient way to achieve the selective C3&#8208;functionalization of DMAP. In contrast, the utilization of an even bulkier i&#8208;Pr3Si substituent leads to exclusive C2&#8208;functionalization due to the dispersion interactions with organometallic bases. For the first time, it is demonstrated that the i&#8208;Pr3Si moiety can serve as a directing group, providing a new type of direct ortho&#8208;metalation effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxydiazomethylation of Alkenes via Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Diazoesters belong to significantly important carbenoid precursors in synthetic chemistry. Diazomethylation&#8208;based difunctionalization of alkenes is highly valuable but remain nontrivial. Herein, we reported a general and modular approach for the direct 1,2&#8208;oxydiazomethylation of alkenes through visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis. This process exploits photocatalyzed strategy to convert alkenes to &#947;&#8208;formyloxyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diazoesters using &#945;&#8208;diazo iodonium salts as carbyne precursors, featuring wide substrate tolerance and broad late&#8208;stage diversi&#64257;cations. Mechanistic studies suggest that the formation of &#947;&#8208;carbocation&#8208;tethered &#945;&#8208;diazoesters plays a crucial role in trapping DMF and H2O to allow for this transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Proximity Effects and Aggregation of Hamilton&#8208;Receptor Barbiturate Host&#8208;Guest Complexes Probed by Cross&#8208;Metathesis and ESI MS Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The molecular environment around supramolecular bonding systems significantly affects their stability and the assembly of host&#8208;guest complexes, most prominent for hydrogen bonds (H&#8208;bonds). Hamilton receptor&#8208;barbiturate host&#8208;guest complexes are well&#8208;known in solution, typically forming a 1:1 molar ratio complex. However, within a polymer matrix, these complexes can form higher&#8208;order assemblies, deviating from the standard 1:1 complex, which are challenging to characterize and often require lab&#8208;intensive methods. In this study, a novel Hamilton receptor (H) was equipped with cyclopentene moieties and used as a host to form host&#8208;guest complexes (H&#8208;B) with allobarbital (B), followed by covalent crosslinking. UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy titration experiments in different solvents and at various temperatures revealed that polar solvents containing additional H&#8208;bonding sites significantly reduce the formation of the 1:1 H&#8208;B complex, as indicated by a reduced association constant. Higher&#8208;order aggregates (HH&#8208;dimer, HHH&#8208;trimer) were subsequently detected via an alkene cross&#8208;metathesis (CM) reaction to fix the assemblies covalently, followed by analysis via electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI MS). This two&#8208;step method, firstly via CM fixation followed by ESI MS, was extended to study the H&#8208;B model complex within a polyisobutylene (PIB) matrix, presenting a direct method to analyze the complex host&#8208;guest assembly in solvent&#8208;free (polymer) environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Defining the Synthetic Scope of ortho&#8208;Quinone Methides by Quantifying Their Electrophilicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of aryl&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;quinone methides (oQMs) was synthesised and structurally characterised. Kinetic studies of the nucleophilic additions of carbanions (reference nucleophiles) to oQMs were used to determine second&#8208;order rate constants k2 for the carbon&#8208;carbon bond forming reactions (20&#160;&#176;C, DMSO) at the oQMs&#8217; exocyclic &#960;&#8208;bond. Analysing the kinetic data by the linear free energy relationship lg k2 = sN(N+E) revealed the Mayr electrophilicities E of the oQMs. The electrophilicities E of oQMs correlate linearly with Hammett substituent constants and experimentally determined reduction potentials Epred as well as with quantum&#8208;chemically calculated methyl anion affinities (MAAs), which provides valuable tools for prediciting the reactivity of further types of oQMs. Embedding the oQMs in Mayr&#8217;s reactivity scales enables to predict novel nucleophilic reaction partners for oQMs and can productively be used to prepare simple Michael adducts as well as 4+2 or 4+1 cyclisation products as demonstrated in this work by several novel reactions with neutral or negatively charged C&#8208;, N&#8208;, and S&#8208;nucleophiles.</dc:description>

         <title>Triflyl [18F]Fluoride as a Solution for Base&#8208;sensitive Late&#8208;stage Nucleophilic Aromatic 18F&#8208;Fluorination Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorine&#8208;18 is the predominant radionuclide used to label Positron Emission Tomography (PET) tracers. One outstanding challenge in nucleophilic aromatic radiofluorination reactions is the sensitivity of precursors and catalysts for basic reaction conditions, which are necessary for the work&#8208;up of [18F]fluoride, resulting in limited reproducibility. Triflyl [18F]fluoride is a new [18F]fluoride source that allows freedom in choice of type and amounts of base and cryptand. The aim of the current work is to explore the scope and limitations of triflyl [18F]fluoride in the late&#8208;stage nucleophilic aromatic 18F&#8208;fluorination of various functionalized precursors, exploring reduced amounts of base and cryptand. The assessment allowed for the application of this new nucleophilic [18F]fluoride reagent to the successful radiosynthesis of boron, stannane, hypervalent iodonium ylide and phenol substrates bearing electron&#8208;deficient, &#8208;neutral and &#8208;rich functional groups as well as the clinically relevant PET tracers [18F]FPEB, [18F]mFBG and [18F]SynVesT&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking the Potential of Push&#8208;Pull Pyridinic Photobases: Aggregation&#8208;Induced Excited&#8208;State Proton Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pH effect on the photophysics of three push&#8208;pull compounds bearing dimethoxytriphenylamine (TPA&#8208;OMe) as electron donor and pyridine as electron acceptor, with different ortho&#8208;functionalization (&#8211;H, &#8211;Br, &#8211;TPA&#8208;OMe), is assessed through steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic techniques in DMSO/water mixed solutions and in water dispersions over a wide pH range. The enhanced intramolecular charge transfer upon protonation of the pyridine&#160;leads to the acidochromic (from colorless to yellow) and acido(fluoro)chromic (from cyan to pink) behaviours of the investigated compounds. In dilute DMSO/buffer mixtures these molecules exhibited low pKa values (&#8804; 3.5) and short singlet lifetimes. Nevertheless, it is by exploiting the aggregation phenomenon in aqueous environment that the practical use of these compounds largely expands: i) the basicity increases (pKa &#8776; 4.5) approaching the optimum values for pH&#8208;sensing in cancer cell recognition; ii) the fluorescence efficiencies are boosted due to Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE), making these compounds appealing as fluorescent probes; iii) longer singlet lifetimes enable Excited&#8208;State Proton Transfer, paving the way for the application of these molecules as photobases (pKa* = 9.1). The synergy of charge and proton transfers combined to the AIE behaviour in these pyridines allows tunable multi&#8208;responsive optical properties providing valuable information for the design of new light&#8208;emitting photobases.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu&#8208;Catalyzed [3+1+1] Cascade Cyclization of O&#8208;Acyl Oximes with Sulfur and Silyl Enol Ethers: Rapid Access to Naphthothiazoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;component cyclization reaction of O&#8208;acyl oximes, silyl enol ethers and elemental sulfur has been developed, in which silyl enol ether acts as a C1 synthon to participate in cyclization reaction and build serious 2&#8208;aroylnaphthothiazoles and 2&#8208;aroylbenzothienothiazoles. Moreover, the products obtained exhibit favorable fluorescence properties, which indicates their potential application as functional materials.







Abstract
A three&#8208;component cyclization reaction of O&#8208;acyl oximes, silyl enol ethers and elemental sulfur has been developed, in which silyl enol ether acts as a C1 synthon to participate in cyclization reaction and build a series of 2&#8208;aroylnaphthothiazoles and 2&#8208;aroylbenzothienothiazoles. The preliminary exploration of the reaction mechanism indicated that this transformation probably proceeded through a radical process, involving S3&#8901;&#8722; as a key intermediate, enabling subsequent nucleophilic substitution with O&#8208;acyl oximes to afford iminosulfur radical, which undergoes 1,3&#8208;H shift to yield sulfur&#8208;centered radical intermediate. And then this intermediate undergoes radical addition with silyl enol ether, leading to the formation of the titled products through intramolecular cyclization and oxidation. Moreover, the products obtained exhibit favorable fluorescence properties, which indicates their potential application as functional materials.

         <title>Oxidative Cleavage of Aromatic C&#8722;O Linkages by Oxoammonium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidative cleavage of aromatic C(sp2)&#8722;O bond is implemented using water as oxygen source and oxoammonium salt as oxidant, which is efficiently applied into cleavage of lignin model compounds and depolymerization of PPO. The oxoammonium cation activates water to form hydroxy&#8208;oxoammonium adduct, which plays the key role in the oxidative cleavage. The recycling of oxoammonium cation is confirmed via electrolysis.







Abstract
Oxidative cleavage of aromatic C(sp2)&#8722;O bond is important to the conversion of biomass and plastic wastes into value&#8208;added chemicals. Here we put forward the oxidative cleavage of para&#8208;C&#8722;O bonds in phenolic compounds in use of oxoammonium salts as oxidant and water as the oxygen source. The mechanism is that oxoammonium cation activates water to form hydroxy&#8208;oxoammonium adduct and thus realizes the ipso&#8208;substitution of 4&#8208;alkoxyphenol, which is proved by substituent effect, isotope labelling experiments, and kinetic analysis. Furthermore, this protocol is successfully applied into the depolymerization of both lignin model compounds with &#945;&#8208;O&#8208;5 and 4&#8208;O&#8208;5 linkages and polyphenylene oxide (PPO).

We first developed the enantioselective Knoevenagel/Michael/cyclization cascade of isatins, cyanoacetates, and 3&#8208;aminomaleimides by employing quinidine&#8208;derived square amides. Under optimized conditions, derivatives of spiro[indoline&#8208;3,4&#8208;pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;b]pyridines] were obtained in good yields (78&#8201;%&#8211;91&#8201;%) with 53&#8201;%&#8211;99&#8201;% enantiomeric excess (ee).







Abstract
Asymmetric synthesis of derivatives of spiro[indoline&#8208;3,4&#8208;pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;b]pyridines] were first developed through the organocatalytic cascade of Knoevenagel/Michael/cyclization reactions using a quinidine&#8208;derived squaramide. Under the optimized conditions, the three&#8208;component reactions of isatins, cyanoacetates, and 3&#8208;aminomaleimides yield the desired heterocycle&#8208;fused spirooxindoles in good yields (78&#8211;91&#8201;%) with 53&#8201;%&#8211;99&#8201;% enantiomeric excess (ee). Notably, this reaction enables a broad substrate scope under mild conditions and provides a convenient method for the enantioselective construction of diverse spirooxindoles combined with dihydropyridine and maleimide skeletons, which has great potential for the construction of new bioactive chemical entities.

Two new non&#8208;centrosymmetric chalcogenides, ACuGa6S10 (A = Rb, Cs) have been successfully synthesized by an &#8220;iterative substitution&#8221; strategy based on chalcopyrite CuFeS2 structural template. ACuGa6S10 (A = Rb, Cs) exhibit wide suitable band gap of 2.48 and 2.40&#8197;eV, respectively, and a large second harmonic generation response (1.5 and 1.8&#215;AgGaS2).







Abstract
Two new non&#8208;centrosymmetric chalcogenides, ACuGa6S10 (A=Rb, Cs) have been successfully synthesized by an &#8220;iterative substitution&#8221; strategy based on chalcopyrite CuFeS2 structural template. Benefiting from the substitution of Fe3+ cations by Ga3+ cations, ACuGa6S10 (A = Rb, Cs) exhibit wide suitable band gap of 2.48 and 2.40&#8197;eV, respectively, which is about five times higher than their structure template CuFeS2, and a large second harmonic generation response (1.5 and 1.8&#215;AgGaS2). Combining theoretical calculation and structural analysis confirms that the [GaS4] tetrahedra make the main contribution on their good liner and nonlinear optical (NLO) performances. The &#8220;iterative substitution&#8221; strategy expands the design idea of materials and can lead to the discovery of a large number of IR NLO compounds.

         <title>Electrochemical Enantioselective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Aldehydes with Aryl Iodides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni&#8208;electrocatalytic cross&#8208;coupling procedure between aldehydes and aryl halides is described leading to enantioenriched diarylmethanol derivatives in the presence of a chiral cyano&#8208;bis(oxazoline) ligand. An electroanalytical study was carried out to gain a better understanding of the mechanism, identifying a proposed ECE&#8208;type mechanism with a formal Ni(I) intermediate and highlighting the key role of the iron salts released by the soluble anode.







Abstract
The preparation of enantioenriched diarylmethanol derivatives is described using nickel&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical cross&#8208;couplings between various alkyl/aryl aldehydes and aryl iodides. Performed in an electrochemical cell equipped with an iron anode and a nickel cathode, this electrocatalytic variant led to the scalemic targeted products in the presence of 2,2&#8208;bis((4&#8197;R,5S)&#8208;4,5&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydrooxazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)acetonitrile (L2), as enantiopure cyano&#8208;bis(oxazoline) ligand. X&#8208;ray structure analysis of a pre&#8208;catalyst, for instance the [Ni(II)(L2)2] complex, with L2 as an anionic bisoxazolinate ligand, confirms the chemical formulation of one nickel surrounded by two ligands. The redox behavior of the new Ni complexes generated in&#8197;situ was first assessed by cyclic voltammetry showing a redox wave at ca. &#8722;1.5&#8197;V that can be assigned to the two&#8208;electron reduction of the Ni(II) center to the Ni(0) state. Oxidative addition between the electrogenerated Ni(0) complex and aryl iodide was evidenced. An intense current was observed in presence of a mixture of the two substrates pertaining an electrocatalytic process. Interestingly, we found that the sacrificial iron anode plays a crucial role in the catalytic mechanism.

         <title>NMR Screen Reveals the Diverse Structural Landscape of a G&#8208;Quadruplex Library</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
G&#8208;quadruplexes are noncanonical nucleic acid structures with a range of biochemical functions. Here we used NMR to obtain a broad overview of the structural features of a 496&#8208;member G&#8208;quadruplex library. Our work highlights the surprising diversity of this library, and shows how NMR can be used to identify classes of sequences with distinct mutational signatures and functions.







Abstract
G&#8208;quadruplexes are noncanonical nucleic acid structures formed by stacked guanosine tetrads. Despite their functional and structural diversity, a single consensus model is typically used to describe sequences with the potential to form G&#8208;quadruplex structures. We are interested in developing more specific sequence models for G&#8208;quadruplexes. In previous work, we functionally characterized each sequence in a 496&#8208;member library of variants of a monomeric reference G&#8208;quadruplex for the ability to bind GTP, promote a model peroxidase reaction, generate intrinsic fluorescence, and to form multimers. Here we used NMR to obtain a broad overview of the structural features of this library. After determining the 1H NMR spectrum of each of these 496 sequences, spectra were sorted into multiple classes, most of which could be rationalized based on mutational patterns in the primary sequence. A more detailed screen using representative sequences provided additional information about spectral classes, and confirmed that the classes determined based on analysis of 1H NMR spectra are correlated with functional categories identified in previous studies. These results provide new insights into the surprising structural diversity of this library. They also show how NMR can be used to identify classes of sequences with distinct mutational signatures and functions.

         <title>Exploring the Role of Titanate Perovskites in the Oxidation of Amines via Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Titanate perovskites, SrTiO3 and CaTiO3, were synthesised via hydrothermal approaches, with temperature and pressure parameters adjusted to optimise material purity. The selective ability of these materials for the photocatalytic oxidative self&#8208;coupling of benzylamine to produce N&#8208;benzylidenebenzylamine was evaluated under mild conditions, with CTO emerging as the most efficient catalyst for this reaction.







Abstract
Considering that structural differences could affect the photocatalytic efficiency of titanate perovskites, cubic SrTiO3 (STO) and tetragonal CaTiO3 (CTO) were synthesised as models to elucidate the structure&#8208;activity relationship. STO and CTO materials were produced through hydrothermal approaches, adjusting parameters such as temperature and pressure to optimise material purity. Among the perovskite photocatalysts, two stand out for their exceptional photocatalytic capacity and crystalline purity: CaTiO3, prepared at 180&#8201;&#176;C for 36&#8197;h, and SrTiO3, synthesised at 200&#8201;&#176;C for 24&#8197;h. Notably, we explore the selective ability of these materials for the photocatalytic oxidative self&#8208;coupling of benzylamine (BZA) to produce N&#8208;benzylidenebenzylamine (BZI), with CaTiO3 emerging as the most efficient catalyst for this reaction. The CTO material prepared at 180&#8201;&#176;C for 36&#8197;h (CTO180T&#8208;36) achieved a peak BZI production of 0.5&#8197;mM, with a total conversion of BZA after 7&#8197;h of irradiation. This study also emphasises the crucial role of reaction conditions and perovskite morphologies in fine&#8208;tuning photocatalytic performance. These findings highlight opportunities for developing efficient and selective photocatalytic processes, holding the compromise for applications in organic synthesis and sustainable green chemistry.

A convenient synthesis of planar chiral [2.2]paracyclophane imidazoline N,O&#8208;ligands has been developed. The application of these classes of ligands showed excellent performance in organozinc additions to aldehydes. An improved seven&#8208;step synthesis of [2.2]paracyclophane&#8208;imidazoline N,O&#8208;ligands (UCD&#8208;Imphanols) possessing both central and planar chirality is presented. These ligands are applied in organozinc additions to aldehydes, achieving enantioselectivities of up to 97&#8201;% ee in ethylation and 95&#8201;% ee (R) and 82&#8201;% ee (S) in arylation using (S,S,SP)&#8208; and (S,S,RP)&#8208;UCD&#8208;Imphanols, respectively.







Abstract
We present an improved and convenient synthesis of [2.2]paracyclophane&#8208;imidazoline N,O&#8208;ligands with central and planar chirality in seven steps starting from [2.2]paracyclophane. The utility of these ligands in organozinc additions to aldehydes is described. The asymmetric ethylation of aldehydes proceeded with enantioselectivities of up to 97&#8201;% ee, while the asymmetric arylation of aldehydes gave up to 95&#8201;% ee (R) and 82&#8201;% ee (S) using (S,S,SP)&#8208;UCD&#8208;Imphanol and (S,S,RP)&#8208;UCD&#8208;Imphanol, respectively.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Dependent Supramolecular Isomeric Co&#8208;CPs for Luminescence Recognition and Catalytic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two supramolecular isomers displayed distinct luminescence of recognition biomarker 2,6&#8208;pyridinedicarboxylic acid (DPA) and homovanillic acid (HVA) and catalysis oxidation sulfides to sulfoxides.







Abstract
Two Co&#8208;based supramolecular isomers were synthesized from a fluorinated carboxylic acid ligand under hydrothermal conditions at varying temperatures. Both exhibited similar one&#8208;dimensional chain structures while different bending connections of the aromatic rings led to different supramolecular structures, namely CoCP&#8208;1 and CoCP&#8208;2, respectively. The structural differences of two isomers resulted in discrepant performance with regards to luminescence sensing and catalysis.

&lt;p&gt;Two supramolecular isomers displayed distinct luminescence of recognition biomarker 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid (DPA) and homovanillic acid (HVA) and catalysis oxidation sulfides to sulfoxides.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Co-based supramolecular isomers were synthesized from a fluorinated carboxylic acid ligand under hydrothermal conditions at varying temperatures. Both exhibited similar one-dimensional chain structures while different bending connections of the aromatic rings led to different supramolecular structures, namely &lt;b&gt;CoCP-1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;CoCP-2&lt;/b&gt;, respectively. The structural differences of two isomers resulted in discrepant performance with regards to luminescence sensing and catalysis. &lt;b&gt;CoCP-1&lt;/b&gt; demonstrated more significant luminescence quenching activity toward biomarkers 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid (DPA) and homovanillic acid (HVA), which could be distinguished in the presence of Eu&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;. The limit of detection (LOD) was found to be as low as 3.4 and 1.3&#8197;&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;M, respectively. The recovery rate of for HVA and DPA was within the range of 98.5&#8211;110.3&#8201;% and 84.6&#8211;99.3&#8201;% in simulated urine and serum, respectively, indicating potential reliability in monitoring these two analytes in real samples.

         <title>Endogenous Cu(II) Labeling for Distance Measurements on Proteins by EPR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quick and easy endogenous spin labeling: This work shows that hypotonic swelling is a reproducible and facile method to endogenously label proteins with Cu(II) protein spin label in E.&#8197;coli cells. The method enables the facile measurement of structural constraints in&#8208;cells. The figure was made using BioRender.com.







Abstract
In&#8208;cell measurements of the relationship between structure and dynamics to protein function is at the forefront of biophysics. Recently, developments in EPR methodology have demonstrated the sensitivity and power of this method to measure structural constraints in&#8208;cell. However, the need to spin label proteins ex&#8208;situ or use noncanonical amino acids to achieve endogenous labeling remains a bottleneck. In this work we expand the methodology to endogenously spin label proteins with Cu(II) spin labels and describe how to assess in&#8208;cell spin labeling. We quantify the amount of Cu(II)&#8208;NTA in cells, assess spin labeling, and account for orientational effects during distance measurements. We compare the efficacy of using heat&#8208;shock and hypotonic swelling to deliver spin label, showing that hypotonic swelling is a facile and reproducible method to efficiently deliver Cu(II)&#8208;NTA into E.&#8197;coli. Notably, over six repeats we accomplish a bulk average of 57&#8197;&#956;M spin labeled sites, surpassing existing endogenous labeling methods. The results of this work open the door for endogenous spin labeling that is easily accessible to the broader biophysical community.

         <title>Networked Multicomponent Ensemble as AND Gate with FRET Output</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on two metal ions inputs (Hg2+ and Li+) a networked six&#8208;component ensemble AND gate has been fabricated. The performance of the gate is evaluated by FRET emission of rhodamine receptor which is controlled by the logic operation of the gate. Application of only one input, does not produce any output result of the gate. Upon addition of both the inputs only, Cu+ ion is released to solution as primary output. The released Cu+ binds with the receptor and ignite a FRET transition. The strict stoichiometric inputs and output of the gate allowa highly defined communication between different parts of the gate. The smooth molecular cybernetics in the multicomponent ensemble is a lucid example that encourages us for further work in controlling intricate mutually dependent supramolecular devices or further complex logic circuits operation. A six&#8208;component AND gate using input of Hg2+ and Li+ ions releases stoichiometric Cu+ which triggers FRET emission in a rhodamine receptor upon binding. Only dual inputs activate the gate, demonstrating precise communication for complex molecular logic circuits.







Abstract
A networked supramolecular logic AND gate system is accomplished using precise chemical communication within a multicomponent ensemble via metal ion&#8208;driven self&#8208;sorting processes. The cybernetic AND gate is composed of a copper(I)&#8208;loaded nanoswitch, an aza&#8208;crown ether and a rhodamine receptor. The modus operandi of the AND gate, from state (0,0), was induced with stoichiometric amounts of two inputs (IN&#8208;1=Hg2+, IN&#8208;2=Li+) generating copper(I) ions as output only in state (1,1). Generation of state (1,1) from state (0,0) involves selective Cu+ ion translocation from the nanoswitch to the aza&#8208;crown ether in the first step (IN&#8208;1) and then from the aza&#8208;crown ether to the rhodamine receptor in the second step (IN&#8208;2). The released copper(I) output acts as a messenger that binds to the rhodamine receptor, triggering it's spiro&#8208;lactam ring opening, which leads to a diagnostic FRET emission from the copper(I)&#8208;loaded rhodamine scaffold accompanied by a remarkable fluorescence and colour change from pale yellow to pink.

         <title>Photooxidation of Toluene Derivatives under HAT and ROS Synergy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study synergistically combines hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation to achieve efficient photocatalytic oxidation of toluene derivatives with low catalyst loading as well as mild conditions, yielding benzoic acid derivatives and aryl ketones, thereby enhancing catalytic efficiency while ensuring both ecological sustainability and economic viability.







Abstract
The valorization of toluene offers a dual solution by addressing its environmental impact while also facilitating the synthesis of a diverse array of valuable fine chemicals and pharmaceutical intermediates, thus ensuring both ecological sustainability and economic viability. We report herein a synergistic approach that harmonizes hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under mild condition and low catalyst loading, which enables the efficient synthesis of a broad spectrum of esteemed benzoic acid derivatives and aryl ketones through the photocatalytic oxidation of toluene derivatives. Mechanistic elucidation reveals that the HAT reagent anthraquinone has both the capabilities to abstract hydrogen atoms and the ability to generate singlet oxygen (1O2) during energy transfer with triplet oxygen (3O2), and the combination of these two potencies significantly improves the catalytic efficiency of the reaction. This study not only introduces the amalgamation of HAT with ROS generation but also delineates a systematic approach for the selection of HAT reagents with energy transfer proficiency for ROS generation in catalytic oxidation reactions.

         <title>Regulatory Mechanisms and Synergistic Enhancement of the Diiron YtfE Protein in Nitric Oxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study investigates the YtfE protein in Escherichia coli, essential for mitigating nitrosative stress by converting nitric oxide to nitrous oxide. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis reveals Tunnel 1 as the main substrate pathway regulated by N&#8208;terminal domain shifts, with Tunnel 2 acting as a backup route. Enhancing Tunnel 2 activity triples YtfE's efficiency, offering strategies to boost bacterial stress responses.







Abstract
The diiron&#8208;containing YtfE protein in Escherichia coli is pivotal in counteracting nitrosative stress, a critical barrier to bacterial viability. This study delves into the biochemical complexity governing YtfE's conversion of nitric oxide (NO) to nitrous oxide, a key process for alleviating nitrosative stress. Through site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, we explored YtfE's molecular structure, with a particular focus on two internal transport tunnels important for its activity. Our findings illuminate Tunnel 1 as the primary conduit for substrate transport, regulated by conformational shifts within the N&#8208;terminal domain that enable substrate access to the diiron core in the C&#8208;terminal domain. Tunnel 2 emerges as a secondary, supportive route, activated when Tunnel 1 is compromised. This result challenges a previous model of distinct tunnels for substrate entry and product exit, suggesting both tunnels are capable of transporting substrates and products. Our engineering efforts enhanced the role of Tunnel 2, enabling a synergistic operation with Tunnel 1 and tripling YtfE's enzymatic activity compared to its wild&#8208;type form. This research not only deepens our understanding of YtfE's regulatory mechanism for NO reduction but also introduces a strategy to amplify its enzymatic efficiency. The outcomes offer new ravenues for modulating bacterial stress responses.

         <title>Regioselective Electrochemical Construction of Csp2&#8722;Csp2 Linkage at C5&#8722;C5&#8217; Position of 2&#8208;Oxindoles via an Intermolecular Anodic Dehydrogenative Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly regioselective electrochemical homo&#8208;coupling strategy was developed for the synthesis of C5&#8722;C5&#8217; dimer of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;2&#8208;oxindole. Control experiments and cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies confirmed that C&#8722;C bond formation occurs via a radical&#8208;radical dimerization process. Density Functional Theory (DFT) studies validated the reaction mechanism and the observed high regioselectivity. The reaction conditions are mild and compatible with a wide range of functional groups.







Abstract
Applying electricity as a reagent in synthetic organic chemistry has attracted particular attention from synthetic chemists worldwide as an environmentally benign and cost&#8208;effective technique. Herein, we report the construction of the Csp2&#8722;Csp2 linkage at the C5&#8722;C5&#8217; position of 2&#8208;oxindole utilizing electricity as the traceless oxidant in an anodic dehydrogenative homo&#8208;coupling process. A variety of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;2&#8208;oxindoles were subjected to dimerization, achieving yields of up to 70&#8201;% through controlled potential electrolysis at an applied potential of 1.5&#8197;V versus Ag/Ag+ nonaqueous reference electrode. This electro&#8208;synthetic approach facilitates the specific assembly of C5&#8722;C5&#8217; (para&#8208;para coupled) dimer of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;2&#8208;oxindole without the necessity of any external oxidants or additives and DFT (Density Functional Theory) calculations provided confirmation of this pronounced regioselectivity. Furthermore, validation through control experiments and voltammetric analyses substantiated the manifestation of radical&#8208;radical coupling (or biradical pathway) for the dimerization process.

&lt;p&gt;A highly regioselective electrochemical homo-coupling strategy was developed for the synthesis of C5&#8722;C5&#8217; dimer of 3,3-disubstituted-2-oxindole. Control experiments and cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies confirmed that C&#8722;C bond formation occurs via a radical-radical dimerization process. Density Functional Theory (DFT) studies validated the reaction mechanism and the observed high regioselectivity. The reaction conditions are mild and compatible with a wide range of functional groups.

         <title>Organocatalytic Electrophilic Arene Amination: Rapid Synthesis of 2&#8208;Quinolones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For decades, the synthesis of 2&#8208;quinolones, a crucial structural motif in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, has relied heavily on costly noble metal complexes and structurally complex ligands. Despite considerable efforts from synthetic chemists, a mild, metal&#8208;free, environmentally friendly, and cost&#8208;effective approach has remained elusive. This study introduces a robust, metal&#8208;free synthetic platform that leverages an innovative organoiodine&#8208;catalyzed electrophilic arene C(sp2)&#8208;H amination strategy to efficiently produce a wide range of new and modifiable 2&#8208;quinolones. Moreover, this study allows ready synthetic access to novel 8&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;quinolones, uncovering new chemical spaces with significant potential for medicinal applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Site&#8208;Selective Defluorinative Etherification between Unactivated Perfluoroarenes and Hydrobenzoxazoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyfluoroaryl ethers represent an important framework of biologically active molecules and materials. Owing to the strong bond dissociation energy of C&#8208;F bond, selectivity and other issues, transition metal&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of polyfluoroaryl ethers from perfluoroarenes via the activation of C&#8208;F bond is challenging and underdeveloped, as compared to the well&#8208;documented C&#8208;O bond formation starting from aryl iodides, aryl bromides or aryl chlorides. Herein, an unprecedented Pd&#8208;catalyzed defluorinative etherification for the synthesis of polyfluoroaryl ether skeletons using hydrobenzoxazoles as phenol surrogate, has been reported. The substrate scope for this protocol is broad, with respect to hydrobenzoxazoles and perfluoroarenes, under mild reaction conditions. More importantly, challenging alkenyl and alkynyl substituted polyfluoroarenes could be successfully used as the coupling component for Pd&#8208;catalyzed etherification reaction. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to investigate the reaction mechanism, which suggested that oxidative addition between polyfluorobenzene and Pd(0) constituted the ratedetermining step.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;Derived Tetracarboxylate Featuring AIE Properties for Dual Ion Sensing and Mechanochromic Self&#8208;Erasable Writing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The integration of multiple functions within a single fluorescent molecule provides a promising platform for developing versatile, efficient, and cost&#8208;effective materials with enhanced performance across diverse applications. In this study, we introduce TPEC, an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) molecule derived from tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based tetracarboxylate, which demonstrates multifunctional capabilities, including metal ion sensing and self&#8208;erasable writing. TPEC exhibits amphiphilicity in water, self&#8208;assembling into single&#8208;layer nanosheets with robust blue fluorescence. Notably, the aqueous solution of TPEC displays a fluorescence colorimetric response to Al3+ ions and fluorescence quenching in the presence of Fe&#179;&#8314; ions. Additionally, TPEC powders undergo fluorescence colorimetric changes under mechanical stimulation, enabling self&#8208;erasable writing on prepared paper. This study presents a straightforward strategy for the development of multifunctional luminescent materials based on the self&#8208;assembly of a single&#8208;component fluorophore.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Clickable Isotactic Poly(vinyl ether)s through Organocatalytic Stereoselective Cationic Copolymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By virtue of the high reliability of click chemistry, polymers with clickable groups provide a useful platform for the rapid synthesis of polymer materials with diverse functionalities and architectures. However, the polymerization of clickable vinyl monomers with a concurrent regulation on tacticity remains underdeveloped. Herein, we report the successful development of a stereoselective cationic copolymerization of C&#8208;C triple bond&#8208;containing vinyl ethers with simple alkyl vinyl ethers by employing confined Br&#248;nsted acid as catalyst, which allows for the synthesis of alkyne&#8208;functionalized vinyl ether copolymers with high isotacticity (up to 90% m), controlled molecular weight, and variable content of C&#8208;C triple bonds. Further transformation of the pendant clickable alkyne groups via thiol&#8208;yne click reactions and copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition reaction enables a modular access to isotactic polymers with various functional groups.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optically active mandelic acid esters represent a highly valuable class of building blocks in organic synthesis and recurrent motifs embedded in bioactive compounds and drugs. Herein, we provide an enantioselective one&#8208;pot synthesis based on Knoevenagel condensation/asymmetric epoxidation/domino ring&#8208;opening hydrolysis (DROH) sequence to the crude mandelic acids, which underwent a final esterification step to (R)&#8208;methyl mandelates. These products have been obtained in good to high overall yield and enantioselectivity, using commercially and widely available reagents and catalyst including aldehydes, phenylsulfonyl acetonitrile, cumyl hydroperoxide, water and an epi&#8208;quinine&#8208;derived urea as the organocatalyst. Moreover, the versatility of the process has been demonstrated to prepare the corresponding &#945;&#8208;alkoxy esters in highly enantioselective manner, when using primary alcohols in a domino ring&#8208;opening esterification (DROE) step. This system is a first example of non&#8208;enzymatic catalytic one&#8208;pot protocol which allows a straightforward asymmetric synthesis of highly valuable mandelic acid derivatives from aldehyde feedstocks.</dc:description>

         <title>Fortuitous Enantiomeric Self&#8208;Rectification of an Unreported Partial Racemisation in the Synthesis of a Chiral Phosphoric Acid: A Warning to Practitioners</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Research Article details a partial racemisation of a 3,3&#8217;&#8208;bis(phenanthrene) substituted BINOL during methoxymethyl (MOM) ether deprotection. Moreover, during phosphorylation of the (partially racemised) BINOL, it was found that a racemic intermediate phosphorochloridate precipitated, fortuitously reestablishing enantiopurity in the chiral phosphoric acid product.







Abstract
Racemisation without Consequence: MOM deprotection during a routine synthesis of phosphoric acid 1 promoted partial racemisation of the product BINOL 5. Surprisingly, however, after phosphorylation of the partially racemised BINOL, enantiopure acid 1 was isolated. Further inspection revealed that during phosphorylation, unhydrolysed racemic phosphorochloridate 6 precipitated, thus restoring homochirality in the product phosphoric acid 1. Moreover, MOM deprotection partial racemisation was avoided by conducting reactions at lower temperatures for no longer than the required deprotection time, and/or by application of other deprotection conditions from the literature.

         <title>Structural Regulation of a Multi&#8208;Component Co2P2O7&#8208;MoN/NC Electrocatalyst for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>

A multi&#8208;component Co2P2O7&#8208;MoN/NC composite is successfully prepared by a facile two&#8208;step method. Co2P2O7&#8208;MoN/NC exhibits a superior OER performance in an alkaline medium, delivering an overpotential of 278&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a Tafel slope of 83.3&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, and long&#8208;term durability over 100&#8197;h. The structural synergy among pyrophosphate, nitride, N&#8208;doped carbon, and the new&#8208;formed CoOOH nanosheets prompts the enhancement of the OER performance significantly.







Abstract
Realizing efficient and durable non&#8208;precious metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) still remains a great challenge. Here, a multi&#8208;component composite of Co2P2O7&#8208;MoN/NC containing pyrophosphate, nitride, and nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon is successfully prepared via a facile two&#8208;step synthesis method. Combining the structural regulation between the active metal&#8208; and non&#8208;metal&#8208;based species, Co2P2O7&#8208;MoN/NC demonstrates superior activity and durability for OER, requiring an overpotential of 278&#8197;mV at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a Tafel slope of 83.3&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, and long&#8208;term stability over 100&#8197;h in an alkaline solution. Post&#8208;characterizations reveal that synergistic effect among stable Co2P2O7, partially dissolved MoN, N&#8208;doped carbon, and new&#8208;formed CoOOH nanosheets enable structural reconstruction, fast charge transfer, and formation of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates, promoting the OER performance significantly. This work provides a promising pathway to tune multi&#8208;components to fabricate efficient transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts in energy conversion applications.

         <title>Role of Solvent and Noncovalent Interactions in Alkaline Reactivity of Strained and Strain&#8208;Free Macrocyclic Disulfides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insights from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solution elucidate apparent contradiction by revealing different solvent exposures of the two sulfur atoms in two isomers of the same macrocycle and even though the disulfide bond in one isomer is stretched, its reactivity is not enhanced.







Abstract
This study employs ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the impact of solvent and noncovalent interactions on the structure&#8208;reactivity relationship of both strain&#8208;free and strained macrocyclic disulfides. Our findings reveal that interactions with water as a solvent significantly influence the minimum energy geometry structures of both conformers of the studied macrocycle. In particular, our simulations identify short contacts, specifically S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;&#8208;aromatic interactions, which suppress reactivity for the strained isomer by obstructing the reaction cone at the minimum free energy. Surprisingly, the free energy barriers for the disulfide reaction with a simple nucleophile (OH&#8722; anion) remain very similar, despite one conformer having a markedly more strained disulfide bond than the other. Enhanced molecular dynamics simulations in an explicit solution elucidate this apparent contradiction by revealing different solvent exposures of the two sulfur atoms in the macrocycles.

         <title>Targeted and Untargeted Amine Metabolite Quantitation in Single Cells with Isobaric Multiplexing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
We developed a single cell amine analysis approach utilizing isobarically multiplexed samples of 6 individual cells along with analyte abundant carrier. This methodology was applied for absolute quantitation of amino acids and untargeted relative quantitation of amines in a total of 108 individual cells using nanoflow LC with high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry. Together with individually determined cell sizes, this provides accessible quantification of intracellular amino acid concentrations within individual cells. The targeted method was partially validated for 10 amino acids with limits of detection in low attomoles, linear calibration range covering analyte amounts typically from 30&#8197;amol to 120&#8197;fmol, and correlation coefficients (R) above 0.99. This was applied with cell sizes recorded during dispensing to determine millimolar intracellular amino acid concentrations. The untargeted approach yielded 249 features that were detected in at least 25&#8201;% of the single cells, providing modest cell type separation on principal component analysis. Using Greedy forward selection with regularized least squares, a sub&#8208;selection of 100 features explaining most of the difference was determined. These features were annotated using MS2 from analyte standards and accurate mass with library search. The approach provides accessible, sensitive, and high&#8208;throughput method with the potential to be expanded also to other forms of ultrasensitive analysis.

         <title>Photoinduced Self&#8208;assembly: An Alternative Strategy for the Construction of Coordination Oligomers and Polymers</title>

         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;assisted assembly: The photosubstitution reactions of a ruthenium precursor complex with bridging ligands having pyrazole moieties afford oligomeric ruthenium complexes. The photochemically synthesized ruthenium complexes act as synthons for longer metal&#8208;complex&#8208;based nanowires with a length of the order of tens&#8208;of nanometers.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled oligonuclear and polynuclear complexes have numerous functionalities and potential applications. Generally, such compounds have been constructed by thermal substitution reactions with bridging ligands. Herein, we report bottom&#8208;up and photochemical construction of functional coordination oligomers and polymers by photosubstitution&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly. The photosubstitution reactions of a ruthenium precursor complex with bridging ligands having pyrazole moieties afford mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, and pentanuclear ruthenium complexes, Ru1&#8211;Ru5, which have one&#8208;dimensional architectures. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding between each bridging ligand is a key to construct the molecular nanowires. All the complexes have been isolated and thoroughly characterized. The photochemically synthesized ruthenium complexes act as synthons for longer metal&#8208;complex&#8208;based nanowires with a length of the order of tens&#8208;of nanometers. The multinuclear complexes are generated by photoinduced self&#8208;assembly in the presence of a base, and they undergo photoinduced disassembly in the presence of acid.

The photochemically synthesized ruthenium complexes act as synthons for longer metal-complex-based nanowires with a length of the order of tens-of nanometers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-assembled oligonuclear and polynuclear complexes have numerous functionalities and potential applications. Generally, such compounds have been constructed by thermal substitution reactions with bridging ligands. Herein, we report bottom-up and photochemical construction of functional coordination oligomers and polymers by photosubstitution-induced self-assembly. The photosubstitution reactions of a ruthenium precursor complex with bridging ligands having pyrazole moieties afford mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, and pentanuclear ruthenium complexes, &lt;b&gt;Ru&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;Ru&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, which have one-dimensional architectures. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding between each bridging ligand is a key to construct the molecular nanowires. All the complexes have been isolated and thoroughly characterized. The photochemically synthesized ruthenium complexes act as synthons for longer metal-complex-based nanowires with a length of the order of tens-of nanometers. The multinuclear complexes are generated by photoinduced self-assembly in the presence of a base, and they undergo photoinduced disassembly in the presence of acid.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tuning the Reactivity of Copper(II)&#8211;Nitrite Core Towards Nitric Oxide Generation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Donor properties of a set of tridentate ligands have been illustrated to tune the oxygen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer (OAT) and proton&#8208;coupled&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer (PCET) reactivity profiles of copper(II)&#8211;nitrite complexes towards the evolution of NO gas in the presence of phosphine and substituted phenols, respectively.







Abstract
Insights into the molecular mechanism and factors affecting nitrite&#8208;to&#8208;NO transformation at transition metal sites are essential for developing sustainable technologies relevant to NO&#8208;based therapeutics, waste water treatment, and agriculture. A set of copper(II)&#8211;nitrite complexes 1&#8211;4 have been isolated employing tridentate pincer&#8208;type ligands (quL, pyL, ClArOL&#8722;, PhOL&#8722;) featuring systematically varied donors. Although the X&#8208;ray crystal structures of the copper(II)&#8211;nitrite cores in 1&#8211;4 are comparable, electrochemical studies on complexes 1&#8211;4 reveal that redox properties of these complexes differ due to the changes in the &#963;&#8208;donor abilities of the phenolate/N&#8208;heterocycle based donor sites. Reactivity of these nitrite complexes with oxygen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer (OAT) reagent (e.&#8201;g. triphenyl phosphine Ph3P) and H+/e&#8722; donor reagent (e.&#8201;g. substituted phenols ArOH) show the reduction of nitrite to NO gas. Detailed kinetic investigations including kinetic isotope effect (KIE), Eyring analyses for determining the activation parameters unfold that reduction of nitrite at copper(II) by Ph3P or ArOH are influenced by the CuII/CuI redox potential. Finally, this study allows mechanism driven development of catalytic nitrite reduction by ArOH in the presence of 10&#8197;mol&#8201;% copper complex (1).

         <title>Simultaneous Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction and H2O Oxidation Under Non&#8208;Sacrificial Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simultaneous photocatalytic CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation under non&#8208;sacrificial ambient conditions is important and challenging. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the two half&#8208;reactions of CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation in photocatalytic CO2 conversion, highlighting the dual&#8208;site photocatalyst design and the key techniques to explore the redox mechanisms at reaction intermediates and excited&#8208;state dynamics.







Abstract
The utilization of CO2, H2O, and solar energy is regarded as a sustainable route for converting CO2 into chemical feedstocks, paving the way for carbon neutrality and reclamation. However, the simultaneous photocatalytic CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation under non&#8208;sacrificial ambient conditions is still a significant challenge. Researchers have carried out extensive exploration and achieved dramatic developments in this area. In this review, we first primarily elucidate the principles of two half&#8208;reactions in the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 with H2O, i.&#8201;e., CO2 reduction by the photo&#8208;generated electrons and protons, and H2O oxidation by the photo&#8208;generated holes without sacrificial agents. Subsequently, the strategies to promote two half&#8208;reactions are summarized, including the vacancy/facet/morphology design, adjacent redox site construction, and Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction development. Finally, we present the advanced in&#8197;situ characterizations and future perspectives in this field. This review aims to provide fresh insights into effectively simultaneous photocatalytic CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation under non&#8208;sacrificial ambient conditions.

         <title>Pro&#8208;aromatic Natural Terpenes as Unusual &#8220;Slingshot&#8221; Antioxidants with Promising Ferroptosis Inhibition Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pro&#8208;aromatic terpene &#947;&#8208;terpinene &#8208; present as minor component in essential oils &#8208; shows antioxidant activity in micelles and liposomes, and protects cells from ferroptosis, by an unprecedented &#8220;slingshot&#8221; mechanism, due to its ability to react with radicals in the lipidic region forming, after fragmentation and aromatization, the HOO&#8901; radical that escapes from the membrane blocking the radical chain.







Abstract
Ferroptosis is a cell death mechanism based on extensive cellular membrane peroxidation, implicated in neurodegenerative and other diseases. The essential oil component &#947;&#8208;terpinene, a natural monoterpene with a unique highly oxidizable pro&#8208;aromatic 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene skeleton, inhibits peroxidation of polyunsaturated lipid in model heterogeneous systems (micelles and liposomes). Upon H&#8208;atom abstraction, an unstable &#947;&#8208;terpinene&#8208;derived peroxyl radical is formed, that aromatizes to p&#8208;cymene generating HOO&#8901; radicals. As HOO&#8901; are small and hydrophilic radicals, they quickly diffuse outside the lipid core, blocking the radical chain propagation of polyunsaturated lipids. This unprecedented antioxidant &#8220;slingshot&#8221; mechanism explains why &#947;&#8208;terpinene shows a protective activity against ferroptosis, being effective at submicromolar concentrations in human neuroblastoma (SH&#8208;SY5Y) cells.

         <title>Fluorination or Not in Small Molecule Solar Cells: Achieving a Higher Efficiency with Halogen&#8208;Free End Group</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two readily accessible and scalable end groups for small molecule donors are developed. The resulting fluorine&#8208;free SBz and fluorine&#8208;containing SBz&#8722;F were blended with Y6 for small molecule organic solar cells (SM&#8208;OSCs). Surprisingly, the fluorine&#8208;containing SBz&#8722;F:Y6 OSCs exhibit a lower efficiency than that of the SBz:Y6 OSCs (9.61&#8201;% vs 11.05&#8201;%).







Abstract
Fluorination is an efficient strategy for improving organic solar cells (OSCs) efficiency, particularly by fluorinating the end group of emerging nonfullerene acceptors. Here, the fluorination effect was investigated by using small molecule donors with fluorine&#8208;free (SBz) and fluorinated (SBz&#8208;F) end groups, paired with the emerging nonfullerene acceptor Y6. Interestingly and unexpectedly, fluorination of the end group negatively affects OSCs efficiency, with fluorine&#8208;free SBz:Y6 OSCs achieving a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.05&#8201;% compared to the fluorine&#8208;containing SBz&#8208;F:Y6 blends (PCE=9.61&#8201;%). Analysis of space&#8208;charge limited currents reveals lower and unbalanced hole/electron mobility in SBz&#8208;F:Y6 compared to the SBz:Y6 blends. These findings are further supported by charge recombination dynamics and donor&#8208;acceptor miscibility analyses.

         <title>Modulating the Supramolecular Assembly of &#945;&#8208;Cyclodextrin and Anderson&#8208;type Polyoxometalate through Covalent Modifications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of unprecedented supramolecular complexes of covalently modified Anderson&#8208;type polyoxometalates (POMs) and &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrins (&#945;&#8208;CDs) have been obtained and characterized in solid state by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, and in aqueous solution using various techniques including 1H DOSY, 2D NOESY 1H NMR, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and electrospray ionization time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectroscopy (ESI&#8208;TOF&#8208;MS). It has been demonstrated that the supramolecular assembly process can be modulated by different covalent modification modes of the Anderson POMs, giving rise to a new type of POM/&#945;&#8208;CD complexes featuring organic&#8208;inorganic pseudo&#8208;rotaxane structures, which are in good contrast to those of POM/&#947;&#8208;CD with poly&#8208;rotaxane type structures. Moreover, it is delighted to find that these pseudo&#8208;rotaxanes of POM/&#945;&#8208;CD exhibit stable chirality in aqueous solution, which has not been accomplished in previously reported POM/&#947;&#8208;CD assemblies.</dc:description>

         <title>Toughening Healable Supramolecular Double Polymer Networks Based on Hydrogen Bonding and Metal Coordination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report supramolecular polymer double networks (DNs) based on poly(n&#8208;butyl acrylate)s featuring orthogonally responsive 2&#8208;ureido&#8208;4[1H]pyrimidinone (UPy) and 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 complexes between 2,6&#8208;bis(1&#8242;&#8208;methylbenzimidazolyl)pyridine (MeBip) ligand and Zn2+ ions as cross&#8208;links. The supramolecular DN exhibits thermal stability, creep resistance, excellent healability, and improved elongation and toughness.







Abstract
Double polymer networks (DNs) consist of two interpenetrating polymer networks and can offer properties that are not merely a sum of the parts. Here, we report an elastic DN made from two supramolecular polymers (SMPs) that consist of the same poly(n&#8208;butyl acrylate) (BA) backbone. The two polymers feature different non&#8208;covalent binding motifs, which form dynamic, reversible cross&#8208;links. The polymers were prepared by reversible addition&#8722;fragmentation chain&#8208;transfer polymerization of n&#8208;butyl acrylate and either the self&#8208;complementary hydrogen&#8208;bonding motif 2&#8208;ureido&#8208;4[1H]pyrimidinone, or the 2,6&#8208;bis(1&#8242;&#8208;methylbenzimidazolyl)pyridine ligand, which forms complexes with metal ions. The supramolecular DN made by these components combines features of the single networks, including high thermal stability and resistance to creep. The DN further exhibits excellent healability and displays a higher extensibility and a higher toughness than its constituents. The mechanical characteristics of the DN can be further enhanced by selectively pre&#8208;stretching one of the networks, which is readily possible due to the reversible formation of the supramolecular cross&#8208;links and their orthogonal stimuli&#8208;responsiveness.

         <title>Electronic Structure Modulating of W18O49 Nanospheres by Niobium Doping for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized Nb&#8208;doped W18O49 (Nbx&#8208;W18O49) electrocatalysts via a &#8220;one pot&#8221; solvothermal method. In 0.5&#8197;M H2SO4, Nb0.6&#8208;W18O49 achieved a low overpotential of 102&#8197;mV at &#8722;10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 65.1&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1. It also showed excellent stability and durability for 20&#8197;h.







Abstract
Hydrogen, known for its high energy density and environmental benefits, serves as a prime substitute for fossil fuels. Nonetheless, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), essential in electrolysis, encounters challenges with slow kinetics and significant overpotential, which elevate costs and reduce efficiency. Thus, developing efficient electrocatalysts to reduce HER overpotential is vital to enhance hydrogen production efficiency and minimize energy consumption. Adjusting the electronic structure of transition metal oxides via elemental doping is a potent strategy to improve the effectiveness of electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution. In this work, we synthesized a set of niobium&#8208;doped tungsten oxides (Nbx&#8208;W18O49) under anoxic conditions using a straightforward &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; solvothermal approach. After doping Nb, the oxygen vacancy content inside W18O49 was increased, which induced a synergistic effect with the active sites of tungsten. In acidic environments, the hydrogen evolution activity of the Nb0.6&#8208;W18O49 electrocatalyst is second only by 20&#8197;wt&#8201;% Pt/C. It attains a current density of &#8722;10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at an overpotential of 102&#8197;mV. By comparison with W18O49, Nb0.4&#8208;W18O49 and Nb0.5&#8208;W18O49, Nb0.6&#8208;W18O49 demonstrates a reduced charge transfer resistance, which significantly enhances its conductivity and the speed of electron movement across interfaces. Coupled with this feature are notably faster HER kinetics. Additionally, it exhibits excellent stability, meaning it maintains its performance and structural integrity over prolonged periods and under various operational conditions. This article provides a new perspective for discovering inexpensive and efficient hydrogen evolution electrocatalyst materials.

         <title>Mass Spectrometry&#8208;Based Platforms for Protein Lipoxidation Profiling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein lipoxidation, a kind of protein post&#8208;translational modification mainly produced under cellular oxidative stress, plays a significant regulatory role in the structure and function of protein. This review describes the source and pathophysiological effects of protein lipoxidation, highlights developments and applications of the detection strategies especially MS&#8208;based chemoproteomic technologies of LDE&#8208;protein adducts and discusses challenges in this field.







Abstract
Lipid peroxidation, occurring through enzymatic or non&#8208;enzymatic processes, generates lipid&#8208;derived electrophiles (LDEs), which can covalently modify nucleophilic amino acid residues in proteins, a process known as protein lipoxidation. This modification can alter protein structure and function, either causing damage or regulating signalling pathways. Identifying the protein targets and specific lipoxidation sites provide important clues for unveiling the oxidative stress&#8208;related protein interaction network and molecular mechanisms of related diseases. In this review, we present a detailed overview of recent advances in protein LDE modification profiling, with a focus on mass spectrometry (MS)&#8208;based chemoproteomic platforms for global protein lipoxidation profiling.

         <title>A Reusable Polystyrene Support for Sustainable yet Cost&#8208;effective Octreotide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid phase synthesis of cyclic peptide drugs derived from disulfide tethers is challenging. A soluble polystyrene support with spacer units between sites of peptide synthesis enables on&#8208;support disulfide cyclization to afford the drug octreotide in good yield and high purity. The protocol is scalable, minimizes reagent waste and reduces raw&#8208;material cost. The support can also be recycled offering a sustainable yet cost&#8208;effective approach for octreotide synthesis.







Abstract
The synthesis of peptide drugs has become facile with the use of supports that enable easy separation of the growing peptide. Peptide synthesis on insoluble supports typically employs excess reagents to enhance reaction efficiency and faces challenges during intramolecular cyclization. A non&#8208;crosslinked soluble polystyrene support is reported herein that improves cyclization efficiency on the support by using spacers. The support efficiency is illustrated by synthesizing octreotide drug in a scalable manner by on&#8208;support cyclization. The methodology drastically reduces the reagent waste, raw&#8208;material cost, and solvent requirement. The support can also be recovered and re&#8208;used up to 3 times making this a very sustainable method.

A non-crosslinked soluble polystyrene support is reported herein that improves cyclization efficiency on the support by using spacers. The support efficiency is illustrated by synthesizing octreotide drug in a scalable manner by on-support cyclization. The methodology drastically reduces the reagent waste, raw-material cost, and solvent requirement. The support can also be recovered and re-used up to 3 times making this a very sustainable method.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>HOST&#8208;GUEST INTERACTIONS FACILITATED BY CHALCOGEN BONDING WITHIN SELENADIAZOLE FUNCTIONALISED PORPHYRIN NANOTUBES</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structural rigidity of tetrakis(4&#8208;pyridyl)porphyrin (TPyP) has been utilised to prepare a robust novel porous coordination polymer of composition Cd2(TPyP)(sez)2 (TPyP = 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;pyridyl)porphyrin, sez = 1,2,5&#8208;benzoselenadiazole&#8208;5&#8208;carboxylate). The coordination polymer may be described as a hexagonal porphyrin nanotube (PNT) and has the potential to bind guest molecules through chalcogen bonding. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) data indicate an internal pore diameter ~9 &#197; which represents ~35% of the crystal volume. Immersion of the PNTs in solvents such as DMSO and CS2 result in the incorporation of these molecules within the nanotubes with chalcogen bonding between host and guest. The crystallographic guest&#8208;inclusion investigations are complemented by solid&#8208;state 77Se, 13C, 113Cd and 2H NMR studies which provide insights into dynamic behaviour. The porosity of the crystals was further explored using gas adsorption experiments, indicating the reversible uptake of CO2, CH4, H2 and N2. Structure&#8208;function relationships are clearly established from complementary crystallographic, NMR and adsorption investigations.</dc:description>

         <title>Perylene&#8208; and Perylene Diimide&#8208;based Framework Materials Constructed through Metal Coordination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of materials composed by coordinative interactions between metal ions and organic linkers, encompassing two&#8208;dimensional (2D), and three&#8208;dimensional (3D) architectures. Metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs), a special case of these species, are discrete molecular &#8220;capsules&#8221; with zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) structures. Over the last two decades, MOFs and MOCs composed of organic perylene (P) and perylene diimide (PDI) linkers have gained much attention due to their versatile properties, which can be further enhanced after incorporation into the frameworks. This minireview highlights recent progress in the construction and application of P/PDI&#8208;based coordination framework materials. The text offers an overview of the synthesis of P/PDI organic linkers, proceeds to their integration into coordination frameworks of different dimensionalities &#8208; 2D and 3D MOFs, and 0D MOCs, and then explores potential applications. These include sensing, photocatalysis, electrochemical devices as well as photothermal conversion and focus on the apparent structure&#8208;property relationships. Finally, the challenges and future prospects of P/PDI&#8208;derived coordination frameworks will be addressed.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring ORR Activity in Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C Catalysts through Phosphorus Incorporation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomically dispersed iron and nitrogen co&#8208;doped carbon materials (Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C) represent promising non&#8208;precious metal catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), offering potential alternatives to noble metal&#8208;based benchmarks. In our study, we investigated the influence of phosphorus doping on the catalytic activity of Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C. The experimental research demonstrate that the doping of phosphorus significantly enhances the ORR activity. Specifically, the resulting Fe&#8208;NPC exhibits high metal loading and excellent ORR activity in 0.1 M KOH with an onset potential of 1.00 V and a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.864 V. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations reveal that phosphorus improves the electrocatalytic activity by activating O2 molecules and reducing the energy barrier (the hydrogenation reaction *OH&#8594;H2O) of the rate&#8208;determining step. Furthermore, Fe&#8208;NPC exhibits promising application prospects as an air cathode in Zn&#8208;air batteries, delivering a high maximum discharge power density of 180.3 mW cm&#8208;2 and outstanding discharge specific capacity (758.8 mAh g&#8208;1Zn) at a discharge current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Frustrated Radical Pairs: From Fleeting Intermediates to Isolable Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present the design and comprehensive investigation of stable para&#8208;substituted triarylamine&#8211;2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ) radical ion pairs (RIPs) generated via single&#8208;electron transfer (SET). We quantified the degree of SET in both solution and solid phases, utilising a suite of spectroscopic techniques including IR, EPR, NMR, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8211;XRD). Our findings reveal that the extent of SET is significantly influenced by the nature of the substituents (MeO &gt; tBu &gt; Br) and the polarity of the solvent (MeCN &gt; DCM &gt; toluene). The radical ion pair [(pMeOPh)3N]&#8226;+[DDQ]&#8226;&#8211; was unambiguously identified using EPR and UV&#8211;vis spectroscopy, and its structure was confirmed by SC&#8211;XRD. Detailed analysis indicates an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state with a thermally accessible triplet state, as corroborated by EPR, magnetic susceptibility measurements, and DFT calculations. This study offers crucial insights into the mechanistic pathways of RIP formation and tuning both in solution and solid states, laying the groundwork for future exploration of their reactivity and potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Ortho Arylation of N&#8208;Aryl Amides and the Construction of Diagonal Tetraarylbenzenediamines and N&#8208;Doped Fulminenes via BBr3&#8208;Derived Dibromoboracycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of biaryl amides, which are prevalent motifs in bioactive molecules, often necessitates lengthy and inefficient procedures. To address these limitations, catalytic C&#8208;H activation protocols have emerged, enabling the direct ortho&#8208;arylation of aryl amides. However, these protocols often suffer from issues such as lack of selectivity, reliance on stoichiometric oxidants, and the requirement for excess reagents and harsh reaction conditions. To overcome these challenges, we present a novel and highly selective protocol for the ortho&#8208;arylation of N&#8208;aryl amides and ureas. The high selectivity originates from the directed installation of BBr3 to form a boracycle, which then undergoes cross&#8208;coupling with an aryl halide. Our method offers significant advantages, including mild reaction conditions, excellent site&#8208;specificity, and scalability. The protocol demonstrates broad compatibility with a diverse range of readily accessible functionalized anilides and aryl iodides, as evidenced by 55 successful examples yielding products in the 30&#8211;95% range. Furthermore, our methodology surpasses conventional approaches by facilitating the one&#8208;pot selective diagonal diarylation of dianilides. This capability unlocks the construction of previously unattainable diagonal aryl systems, which serve as valuable precursors for the synthesis of diagonal tetraarylbenzenediamines and N&#8208;doped fulminene, two crucial compound classes in materials science.</dc:description>

         <title>Odorant Binding Proteins Facilitate the Gas&#8208;Phase Uptake of Odorants Through the Nasal Mucus</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mammalian odorant binding proteins (OBPs) have long been suggested to transport hydrophobic odorant molecules through the aqueous environment of the nasal mucus. While the function of OBPs as odorant transporters is supported by their hydrophobic beta&#8208;barrel structure, no rationale has been provided on why and how these proteins facilitate the uptake of odorants from the gas phase. Here, a multi&#8208;scale computational approach validated through available high&#8208;resolution spectroscopy experiments reveals that the conformational space explored by carvone inside the binding cavity of porcine OBP (pOBP) is much closer to the gas than the aqueous phase, and that pOBP effectively manages to transport odorants by lowering the free energy barrier of odorant uptake. Understanding such perireceptor events is crucial to fully unravel the molecular processes underlying the olfactory sense&#160;and move towards the development of protein&#8208;based biomimetic sensor units that can serve as artificial noses.</dc:description>

         <title>A Rare Case of Magnesium Alkyl Mediated CO&#8208;to&#8208;Alkoxide Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alcohols can be produced by nucleophilic addition at the C=O functional group of ketones or aldehydes. Such C&#8208;C bond formations generally proceed smoothly and selective. In contrast, nucleophilic addition at carbon monoxide is considerably more complex and unselective due to the instability of polar metal acyl intermediates. Herein, we report a magnesium alkyl complex, stabilized with a dipyrromethenide ligand, and its reactivity with CO2 and CO. Whilst the reaction with CO2 gave the expected carboxylate, reaction with CO took a surprising course, resulting in an alkoxide by formation of three new C&#8211;C bonds in a single reaction. An intertwined experimental and computational approach sheds light on the unusual reactivity of a carbene intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechano&#8208;responsive fluorescent gel based on tetraphenylethylene&#8208;crosslinked dynamic covalent network</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid development of mechano&#8208;responsive fluorescence has been driven by its promising applications in the fields of sensors, information encryption, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. However, designing mechanophores that can exhibit fluorescence changes under relatively low force remains challenging. In this study, a mechano&#8208;responsive fluorescent gel was developed using a tetraphenylethylene derivative as a cross&#8208;linker, producing a dynamic covalent network that exhibits increased fluorescence under tensile stress. Based on controlled experimental studies and molecular modeling calculations, the fluorescence enhancement by external forces was attributed to the restriction of intramolecular motion in tetraphenylethylene by macromolecular chain orientation. In time&#8208;dependent experiments, due to the exchange of dynamic covalent bonds, the stress relaxation and the decrease in fluorescence intensity of the gel at fixed strain occurred simultaneously, demonstrating the potential of this fluorescence as an indication of internal stress through aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) type mechanophore.</dc:description>

         <title>Distance&#8208;dependent symmetry&#8208;breaking charge transfer in 9,10&#8208;bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene dimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To investigate the effect of the through&#8208;bond coupling strength on the symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation (SB&#8208;CS) dynamics and mechanism, three 9,10&#8208;bis((4&#8208;hexylphenyl)ethynyl)anthracene dimers with varying distances, viz., a single&#8208;bond linked dimer (0&#8208;dimer), a phenylene linked dimer (1&#8208;dimer) and a para&#8208;biphenylene linked dimer (2&#8208;dimer), were synthesized and studied systematically using steady&#8208;state and transient spectroscopy. Steady&#8208;state absorption spectra revealed that the electronic coupling strength decreased gradually with the increase of the inter&#8208;chromophore distance, and the transition of S0&#8594;S1 includes the dark charge transfer (CT) excitation. fs&#8208;TA spectra demonstrated that SB&#8208;CS could be conducted in both weakly and highly polar solvents for 0&#8208;dimer, but the SB&#8208;CS dynamics has a significant difference. In weakly polar solvents, SB&#8208;CS only produces the partial CT (PCT) state, but it could generate the CT state via the PCT state in highly polar solvent. In comparison, SB&#8208;CS is only proceeded in highly polar solvents in 1&#8208;dimer and 2&#8208;dimer to produce the CT state directly. These results demonstrate that the SB&#8208;CS dynamics is strongly dependent on the inter&#8208;chromophore electronic coupling, and the relatively strong electronic coupling is crucial for the occurrence of SB&#8208;CS in weakly polar environment that is commonly presented in photoelectric devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Seeing double: the persistent dimer&#8208;of&#8208;dimers structure of drug resistant influenza A M2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The currently circulating S31N variant of the M2 proton channel of influenza A is resistant to antiviral drugs. Recently, there has been a growing concern regarding the impact of the lipid environment on the structural features of the S31N variant. The native symmetry of the M2 tetramer remains controversial. Here we show that S31N M2 persists in a dimer&#8208;of&#8208;dimers structure in different lipid preparations independent of the amount of solvating lipids up to at least 180 lipids per tetramer. NMR spectra clearly detect the characteristic resonances of the dimer&#8208;of&#8208;dimers of M2 (residues 18&#8208;60 or 18&#8208;62) reconstituted in lipids. NMR&#8208;based distance measurements indicate that two isoleucine residues with upfield shifted alpha carbon resonances, typical of extended conformations, are compatible with a particular side&#8208;chain rotameric state and helical backbone geometry. These chemical shifts are therefore compatible with the expected native transmembrane helical fold. Symmetry breaking at the pH sensing H37 residues, detected via peak doubling, is a stable feature of S31N M2 based on the reference strain Udorn/1972(H3N2). By contrast, the spectrum is dramatically altered for Columbia/2014/(H3N2) M2, which differs in sequence in the amphipathic helices. This highlights an allosteric coupling between the amphipathic helices and the pH sensing residues.</dc:description>

         <title>Open Sn Framework Structure Hosting Bi Guest atoms &#8211; Synthesis, Crystal and Electronic Structure of Na13Sn26Bi</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although several Na&#8208;Sn&#8208;Pnictides with a variety of structural motives are known, no ternary compound in the Na&#8208;Sn&#8208;Bi system has been described yet. In this paper we present the Zintl&#8208;phase Na13Sn25.73Bi1.27 comprising a complex, open&#8208;framework structure of Sn atoms, with one mixed Sn/Bi site, hosting Na atoms.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Although several Na-Sn-Pnictides with a variety of structural motives are known, no ternary compound in the Na-Sn-Bi system has been described yet. In this paper we present the Zintl-phase Na13Sn25.73Bi1.27 comprising a complex, open-framework structure of Sn atoms, with one mixed Sn/Bi site, hosting Na atoms. An additional Bi atom is loosely connected with only weak contacts to the framework filling a larger cavity within the network. According to band structure calculations of the two ordered variants with either full occupation of the mixed site with Sn or Bi, resulting in Na13Sn26Bi and Na13Sn24Bi3, respectively, both compounds are semiconductors with band gaps of 0.5 eV.

         <title>Iodide Double Perovskites and the Limits of their Structural Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While halide double perovskites A2M(I)M(III)X6 have attracted significant attention, examples involving iodides are rare. We examine the limits of the structural stability of iodide double perovskites, presenting the synthesis and single&#8208;crystal structures of Cs2NaScI6 and Cs2NaYI6. Bypassing the common expectation that iodides have small band gaps, these compounds display optical gaps of 3.10 eV [M(III) = Sc] and 3.65 eV [M(III) = Y]. Cs2NaScI6 is the only iodide double perovskite to exhibit a cubic crystal structure at room temperature. Density functional theory&#8208;based electronic structure calculations help understand the role of competing Cs3M(III)2I9 (3:2:9) phases and provide possible reasons for why iodide double perovskites based around In(III), Sb(III) and Bi(III) cations have proved elusive. We confirm design rules for halide double perovskite based around concepts of the tolerance factor and the radius ratio of the smaller, trivalent ion, but also point to situations such as what is observed for Cs2NaScI6 where a double perovskite can be trapped in a metastable structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Neo&#8208;Glycolipid Oximes as Intestinal Permeation Enhancers for Peptide Hormone PYY3&#8208;36</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe the design and synthesis of 16 neo&#8208;glycolipids that are potential permeation enhancers for oral drug delivery of peptide therapeutics. These amphiphilic neo&#8208;glycolipids are composed of fatty acids and various carbohydrates (D&#8208;glucose, lactose, cellobiose, maltose) via an oxime linker. The ability of the synthesized neo&#8208;glycolipids to enhance permeation of fluorescein&#8208;labelled dextran (4 kDa) or 3H&#8208;mannitol across intestinal epithelium was investigated in vitro using monolayers of human epithelial Caco&#8208;2 cells. Their effects were compared with (pre&#8208;)clinically known enhancers as reference compounds; sodium salts of octanoic, decanoic, and dodecanoic acid, and sodium salcaprozate (SNAC). Most neo&#8208;glycolipids increased the permeation of the model compounds, proving that neo&#8208;glycolipids, which possess vastly different properties from the reference compounds, e.g., in terms of clogD and polar surface area, are effective permeation enhancers. The neo&#8208;glycolipid based on decanoic acid and glucose was more potent than related compounds based on disaccharides. Significant differences in solubility and cellular compatibility were found for neo&#8208;glyolipids based on different carbohydrates. Finally, neo&#8208;glycolipids were evaluated as permeation enhancers for the peptide hormone PYY3&#8208;36. Glucose&#8208; and maltose&#8208;derived neo&#8208;glycolipids based on decanoic and dodecanoic acid showed promising enhancements in PYY3&#8208;36 permeation while maintaining good cellular compatibility, relevant for oral delivery of obesity treatments.</dc:description>

         <title>Sonodynamic Cancer Therapy by Mn(I)&#8208;tricarbonyl complexes via Ultrasound&#8208;triggered CO release and ROS generation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel ferrocene conjugated Mn(I)&#8208;tricarbonyl complex viz [Mn(Fc&#8208;tpy)(CO)3Br] (Mn2) where, Fc&#8208;tpy = 4'&#8208;ferrocenyl&#8208;2,2':6',2''&#8208;terpyridine was synthesized and fully characterized along with its non&#8208;ferrocene analog [Mn(Ph&#8208;tpy)(CO)3 Br] Ph&#8208;tpy = 4'&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2,2':6',2''&#8208;terpyridine (Mn1) for ultrasound (US) activated anticancer applications. The X&#8208;ray structure of Mn2 confirmed its distorted octahedral geometry. Mn1 and Mn2, for the first time, showed US&#8208;triggered release of CO and ROS generation (1O2 and &#8226;OH) in an aqueous solution from any Mn(I)&#8208;tricarbonyl complexes, indicating its potential for synergetic CO gas therapy and sonodynamic therapy. The above&#8208;mentioned in&#8208;solution chemistry was successfully translated into in vitro cellular models. These complexes showed unprecedented US&#8208;triggered toxicity against T&#8208;cell lymphoma and human breast cancer cells (IC50 for Mn2 &lt; 1 &#956;M) while were minimally toxic without US or against normal spleen cells. Mn2 was ca. 12 fold more anticancer active than Mn1, indicating that the ferrocene conjugation augmented the US sensitivity. The apoptotic sonotoxicity of Mn2 was due to US&#8208;promoted mitochondrial depolarization via ROS generation and CO release. The apoptosis was triggered by caspase 3 activation. This is the first report of Mn(I)&#8208;tricarbonyl&#8208;based sonosensitizers for cancer SDT. Overall, this study, for the first time, establishes the effectiveness of 3d metal carbonyls in SDT.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>X&#8208;ray scintillators, materials that convert high&#8208;energy radiation into detectable light in the ultraviolet to visible spectrum, are widely used in industrial and medical applications. Organic and organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid systems have emerged as promising alternatives for X&#8208;ray detection and imaging due to their mechanical flexibility, lightweight, tunable excited states, and solution processability for large&#8208;scale fabrication. However, these systems often suffer from weak X&#8208;ray absorption and insufficient exciton utilization, which seriously affects their scintillation performance, limiting their potential for broader application and commercialization. This review highlights recent advances in molecular engineering for developing high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray scintillators. It&#160;focuses on molecular design principles, such as the heavy atom effect, donor&#8208;acceptor/host&#8208;guest strategies, hydrogen/halogen bonding, molecular sensitization, and crystal packing, for enhancing scintillation performance. By leveraging these approaches, researchers have made significant strides in improving X&#8208;ray scintillation efficiency and advancing the potential of these materials for commercial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in NIR&#8208;Switchable Multi&#8208;Redox Systems Based on Organic Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes, exhibiting absorption in the NIR region (750&#8208;2500 nm), have been applied to various optical applications such as security marking, photovoltaic cells and chemotherapy of deep tissues in vivo. Electrochromic systems capable of switching NIR absorption are attractive from the viewpoint of applications for material and life science, and thus several examples have been reported to date. The development of organic&#8208;based materials is needed to reduce the environmental impact and improve biocompatibility, however, the switching of NIR absorption based on redox interconversion is still a challenging issue regarding reversibility and durability during interconversion. To overcome this potential instability, several studies on organic electrochromic systems that allow ON/OFF switching of NIR absorption have been developed in recent years. In this review, we focus on redox&#8208;active well&#8208;defined small molecules that enable ON/OFF switching of NIR absorption, and present recent studies on their intrinsic electrochemical and spectroscopic properties and/or structural characterization of their charged states. We also address more sophisticated electrochromic systems that can modulate their properties in response to external stimuli such as light, heat, and electric potential.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, near-infrared (NIR) dyes, exhibiting absorption in the NIR region (750-2500 nm), have been applied to various optical applications such as security marking, photovoltaic cells and chemotherapy of deep tissues in vivo. Electrochromic systems capable of switching NIR absorption are attractive from the viewpoint of applications for material and life science, and thus several examples have been reported to date.

         <title>Construction and Comparative Research of Two MOFs Proton Conducting Materials Containing Nitro Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In field of electrochemistry, there has been a growing interest in the potential applications of proton&#8208;conducting metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). Therefore, how to design and synthesize MOFs with high proton conductivity is considered crucial. In this study, two examples of nitro&#8208;containing Cd&#8208;based MOFs, MOF&#8208;1 {[Cd3(TIPE)1.5(NO3)5Cl(H2O)2]&#183;17H2O}n and MOF&#8208;2 {[Cd(TIPE)0.5(nip)]&#183;10H2O}n (TIPE=1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;(1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;1&#8208;yl)phenyl)ethene, H2nip=5&#8208;Nitroisophthalic Acid), had been successfully designed and synthesized, and their proton&#8208;conducting properties were thoroughly investigated. Notably, both materials displayed peak proton conductivity at 98% RH and 90 &#176;C, exhibiting values of 9.13 &#215; 10&#8208;3 and 3.00 &#215; 10&#8208;3 S&#8729;cm&#8208;1 for MOF&#8208;1 and MOF&#8208;2, respectively. The plausible proton conduction pathways and mechanisms were elucidated through structural analyses, water vapor adsorption studies, and the determination of activation energy (Ea) values. It was found that the difference in proton conductivity between MOF&#8208;1 and MOF&#8208;2 was mainly associated with the different water absorption rates of the samples. The uniqueness of this study was that for the first time conducted an in&#8208;depth study of the role of nitrate in proton conduction, providing new ideas for designing materials with excellent proton conductivity.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visible&#8208;light excitation of a family of bimetallic ruthenium polypyridines with the formula [RuII(tpy)(bpy)(&#120583;&#8208;CN)RuII(py)4L]n+ (RuRuLn+), where L = Cl&#8211;, NCS&#8211;, DMAP and ACN, was used to prepare photoinduced mixed&#8208;valence (PI&#8208;MV) MLCT states as models of the photosynthetic reaction center. Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy allowed to monitor photoinduced IVCT bands between 6000 and 11000 cm&#8211;1. Mulliken spin densities resulting from DFT and (TD)DFT computations revealed the modulation of the charge density distribution depending on the ligand substitution pattern. Results are consistent with PI&#8208;MV systems ranging from non&#8208;degenerate Class II to degenerate Class III, with electronic couplings between 1000 and 3500 cm&#8211;1.&#160;These findings guide the control electron localization&#8208;delocalization in charge&#8208;transfer/charge&#8208;separated excited states, like those involved in the photosynthetic reaction center.</dc:description>

         <title>Membrane&#8208;free Electrolysis Production of Hydrogen Peroxide on Low&#8208;Cost Metal&#8208;Free Electrocatalysts for Dye Degradation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficient production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) solution was achieved by combining cathodic two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction (2e&#8208; ORR) and anodic two&#8208;electron water oxidation (2e&#8208; WOR) in two half&#8208;reaction cells. h&#8208;BN loaded on carbon fibers (h&#8208;BN@C) is prepared and employed as an anode material to catalyze 2e&#8208; WOR, while sulfonated commercial BP&#8208;2000 carbons (BP&#8208;2000&#8208;SO3H) were prepared as the cathode materials for 2e&#8208; ORR. In a 2 M KHCO3 solution, an overall Faradaic efficiency of 97% and a total H2O2 production rate of 1872 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 over metal&#8208;free electrodes were accomplished in a membrane&#8208;free flow cell. The dilute H2O2 solution could be directly used to degrade cationic Rhodamine B or methyl orange and anionic methylene blue dyes in water. This work proved low&#8208;cost production of dilute H2O2 solution in simple membrane&#8208;free flow cells with single electrolyte and on&#8208;site utilization for efficient dye degradation.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Particle Size Template Method for Controllable Synthesis of Nitrogen&#8208;doped Multilevel Porous Carbon as High&#8208;rate Zn&#8208;ion Hybrid Supercapacitor Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving high rate performance without compromising energy density has always been a critical objective for zinc&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitors (ZHSCs). The pore structure and surface properties of carbon cathode materials play a crucial role. We propose utilizing a hybrid particle size (20 and 40 nm) magnesium oxide templates to regulate the pore structure of nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbon derived from the soybean isolate. The multilevel pore structure enhanced ion transport efficiency while also improving the utilization of micropores. Nitrogen doping and oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups enhanced the wettability of carbon materials with aqueous electrolytes and facilitated the chemisorption of Zn2+ on the carbon material surface. The nitrogen&#8208;doped multilevel porous carbon material (HT&#8208;NMPC&#8208;1/1) prepared with a 1:1 mass ratio of the two templates exhibited a specific capacity of 146.65 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.2 A g&#8208;1. Moreover, the Swagelok cells assembled with HT&#8208;NMPC&#8208;1/1 and Zn foil achieved a high energy density of 121.5 W h kg&#8208;1, high power output of 166 W kg&#8208;1, and 93.09% capacity retention after 8000 cycles at 2 A g&#8208;1. Therefore, HT&#8208;NMPC&#8208;1/1 is a highly promising candidate for ZHSCs cathode materials. Furthermore, the novel pore regulation strategy and straightforward preparation method offer valuable reference points for other porous carbon&#8208;based functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Role of Active Centers in Predicting the Catalyst Turnover: A Theoretical Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water oxidation catalysis has garnered significant attention due to its potential for sustainable energy conversion. Among molecular catalysts, [Fe(OTf)2 (Me2Pytacn)] complexes have exhibited notable turning&#8208;over rates. Although various [M(OTf)2 (Me2Pytacn)] complexes (M = Mn, Co, Ni) have been synthesized, however, the role of active centres has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we apply our newly developed catalytic models, efficiency conceptualization model (ECM) and the maximum kinetic efficiency MaxKinEff framework to assess the role of the active centres in its catalytic performance. Our computational analysis identifies cobalt&#8208;based [Co(OTf)2 (Me2Pytacn)] as a superior alternative for water oxidation reactions. Notably, cobalt catalysts exhibit a longer lifespan (~ 44 days) and higher turnover numbers (TON), with computed values of &#160;(ECM) = 3.30 h&#8208;1, &#160;(ECM) = 3456, (MaxKinEff) = 12.43 h&#8208;1, and &#160;(MaxKinEff) = 3616. These findings suggest that cobalt could play a pivotal role in improving the efficiency of molecular catalysts for water oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Tetramethoxy&#8208;acridiniums for Fluorophores and Organic Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetramethoxy substituted alkyl&#8208;acridiniums are readily available by facile nucleophilic aromatic substitution on tris(dimethoxyphenyl)carbenium, but are non&#8208;fluorescent, presumably due to intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer quenching. In this work we introduce electron withdrawing groups by electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions, leading to fluorescence turn&#8208;on. The acridiniums are moderately fluorescent (&#981;f = 20%) with long fluorescene lifetimes (&#964;f = 9 ns). The positive excited state reduction potentials (E*red = +1.6 V) make the TMAcr+ excellent electron acceptors in the excited state, and efficient reductive photoredox catalysts able to oxidize a broad range of substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Potassium Phosphate&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of C4&#8208;Phosphorylated Quinolines via Cascade Cycloisomerization of Ynones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A cascade phosphorylation cycloisomerization of readily accessible ynones and diphenylphosphine oxides facilitated by potassium phosphate is described, allowing for the straightforward synthesis of C4&#8208;phosphorylated quinoline scaffolds. The formation of a C&#8722;P bond and a C&#8722;N bond is achieved in a single procedure without the need for pre&#8208;assembled quinoline cores prior to phosphorylation. This transformation operates without the requirement for metals or oxidants and exhibits excellent compatibility with various functional groups. Furthermore, antimicrobial activity evaluation demonstrated that the synthesized C4 phosphorylated quinoline derivatives exhibited potent inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus.</dc:description>

         <title>An Efficient Bifunctional Core&#8208;Shell ZIF&#8208;90@ZIF&#8208;67 Composite as a Stable Pickering Interfacial Catalyst for the Deacetalization&#8211;Knoevenagel Tandem Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploiting advanced solid particles is crucial to the construction of Pickering emulsions catalysis. Recently, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been used as ideal emulsifiers stabilizing Pickering emulsions for interfacial catalysis. Although Pickering emulsions stabilized by core&#8208;shell MOFs have significant importance in practical studies, to date there have been very limited reports on this topic. Herein, ZIF&#8208;90@ZIF&#8208;67, a core&#8208;shell material with simultaneous acid&#8208;base bifunctionality, was synthesized by seeded epitaxial growth. It was firstly applied as an emulsifier in Pickering emulsions to catalyze the deacetalization&#8208;Knoevenagel tandem reaction, which exhibited excellent catalytic properties and achieved extremely high yields. Additionally, ZIF&#8208;90@ZIF&#8208;67 showed high stability and remained well repeatable after five cycles. This work provides a platform for the design of structurally and functionally diverse MOF&#8208;based Pickering emulsions interfacial catalysis.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this review, the difference between &#960;&#8208;mers (pimers) and &#960;&#8208;dimers (pi&#8208;dimers) will be discussed. Often interchanged or confused in the literature, these two radical interactions lead to different or even opposite physico&#8208;chemical behaviors. This review aims at clarifying the terms &#960;&#8208;mers and &#960;&#8208;dimers and at describing their main physico&#8208;chemical properties to address their differences. Finally, selected literature examples exhibiting the successive formation of &#960;&#8208;mers and &#960;&#8208;dimers within the same systems will be detailed to emphasize the physico&#8208;chemical changes occurring upon conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Bismuth Bound to Transition Metals: Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Olefin Coordination, Reductive Elimination, and Oxidative Addition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of dibenzobismepinyl (C14H10Bi) substituted transition metal complexes of the type [(C14H10Bi)M(CO)x(L)] (M = Mn, Co, Fe) was prepared in salt elimination reactions from a halobismepine and sodium metallates. Irradiation of these complexes with visible light has been investigated, aiming at the elimination of one carbonyl ligand and the concomitant coordination of the bismepine&#8217;s olefin moiety to the transition metal center. The resulting complexes of the type [{&#954;2C,&#954;1Bi&#8208;(C14H10)Bi}M(CO)x&#8722;1(L)] (M = Co, Fe) have been isolated and fully characterized. When two dibenzobismepinyl units are positioned in the coordination sphere of an iron carbonyl complex fragment, reductive elimination / oxidative addition events of the dibismuthane (C14H10Bi)2 have been shown to be relevant. The analytical techniques applied in this work include (heteronuclear) NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, UV/Vis spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy and (TD)&#8208;DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Experimental Characterization of a Sialyl Cation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sialic acids are monosaccharide residues involved in several biological processes. Controlling the stereoselectivity of sialylation reactions is challenging and mechanistic studies on the structure of its intermediate, the sialyl cation, are scarce. Here it is shown that a sialyl cation can be generated and isolated from an ionized sialic acid precursor. This short&#8208;lived species is structurally characterized for the first time using cryogenic infrared spectroscopy. In combination with quantum chemical calculations, the results reveal that the positive charge at the anomeric carbon of the sialyl cation is stabilized by remote participation of the C5&#8208;NHAc group leading to the formation of a bridged structure. In this structure, the &#946;&#8208;side is shielded from nucleophilic attack, potentially explaining the &#945;&#8208;selectivity of this building block in SN1&#8208;type sialylation reactions. Other modes of participation are energetically unfavored and cannot be observed experimentally.</dc:description>

         <title>Active Photonic Glass for Hydrogen Generation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality is vital in many living species since it is responsible for structural iridescent coloration and plays a key role in light harvesting during natural photosynthesis. Developing photoactive materials with such chiral structures is a challenging but promising strategy for energy applications. Here, we describe a straightforward method to establish an active photonic glass obtained through the co&#8208;condensation of&#160;tetramethyl orthosilicate (TMOS) and titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (TAA) dissolved in a liquid crystal formed from cellulose nanocrystalline (CNC). The inorganic glass maintains a long range of chiral nematic ordering, displaying iridescent colors characterized by a Bragg peak reflection. The reflected wavelengths are tuned all over the UV&#8208;visible range, demonstrating that the replica of the chiral nematic structure generates photonic properties. Incorporation of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) into the films is further performed by impregnation/chemical reduction. We show that the charge carrier density and photocatalytic H2 generation were amplified when the photonic band gap edges matched the absorbance of the TiO2 and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of AuNPs. This photocatalytic glass with chiral nematic ordering and a tunable photonic bandgap paves the way for the development of metamaterials with new applications, such as asymmetric photocatalysis.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chirality is vital in many living species since it is responsible for structural iridescent coloration and plays a key role in light harvesting during natural photosynthesis. Developing photoactive materials with such chiral structures is a challenging but promising strategy for energy applications. Here, we describe a straightforward method to establish an active photonic glass obtained through the co-condensation of&#160;tetramethyl orthosilicate (TMOS) and titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (TAA) dissolved in a liquid crystal formed from cellulose nanocrystalline (CNC). The inorganic glass maintains a long range of chiral nematic ordering, displaying iridescent colors characterized by a Bragg peak reflection. The reflected wavelengths are tuned all over the UV-visible range, demonstrating that the replica of the chiral nematic structure generates photonic properties. Incorporation of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) into the films is further performed by impregnation/chemical reduction. We show that the charge carrier density and photocatalytic H2 generation were amplified when the photonic band gap edges matched the absorbance of the TiO2 and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of AuNPs.

         <title>Borenium Ion Equivalents Stabilized by BICAAC and Their Implementation as Catalysts in Hydrosilylation of Carbonyls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydride abstraction from the borane adduct, (BICAAC)&#8231;BH3 afforded the hydride bridged dinuclear borenium ion equivalent complexes 1 and 2 that have been characterized by various spectroscopic and spectrometric techniques followed by the assessment of Lewis acidity using the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method. The single crystal X&#8208;ray structure of complex 2 revealed the presence of discrete ions in the solid state. The complex (BICAAC)&#8231;BH2(OTf) (3), obtained from the reaction of (BICAAC)&#8231;BH3 with MeOTf, forms the corresponding boronium cations [(BICAAC)&#8231;BH2(L)]+(OTf)&#8208; on reaction with Lewis bases (L = pyridine (4) and DMAP (5)). Complexes 1 and 2 demonstrated notable catalytic activity in the hydrosilylation of a diverse array of carbonyls using 1.0 mol% catalyst loading (achieving the highest turnover frequency (TOFmax) of up to 1200 h&#8208;1 with benzaldehyde. A broad substrate scope has been presented for aldehydes and ketones decorated with various electron&#8208;donating and withdrawing substituents along with this the hydrosilylation of a few para&#8208;quinone methides has also been presented.</dc:description>
