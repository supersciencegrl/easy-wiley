         <title>Shedding Light on Synthetic Autocatalysis: From Conventional Closed&#8208;Shell Chemistries to Overlooked Open&#8208;Shell Occurrences</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Why add another catalyst when the product itself holds the power to catalyze its own formation? Autocatalysis in synthetic chemistry enhances reaction efficiency and uncovers novel catalytic behavior across both closed&#8208;shell and open&#8208;shell systems, expanding reactivity and enabling innovative design strategies.








Abstract
Autocatalysis is a kinetic phenomenon where a reaction product catalyzes its own formation, often leading to sigmoidal reaction profiles and exponential rate acceleration. This process plays a fundamental role in biological systems, for example, in chemistry of the origins of life. Although synthetic reactions are not as widely reported as the biological studies, autocatalysis offers a unique mechanism and high efficiency to organic synthesis. This review highlights diverse synthetic examples in various autocatalytic mechanistic paradigms, including well&#8208;studied examples such as the Soai reaction. We also explore emerging examples in radical&#8208; and photochemistry&#8208;based systems, emphasizing recent advances in auto&#8208;photocatalysis. By exploring examples from different fields, this review aims to highlight the variety and potential of autocatalytic reactions for synthesis. We aim to encourage further research into autocatalysis as a powerful strategy for improving reaction efficiency, revealing new reaction pathways, and inspiring innovative catalytic methodologies.

         <title>Water&#8208;Soluble Squaraine&#8208;Based NIR Chromofluorogenic Probe for HClO/ClO&#8722; Detection in Environmental Waters and Live&#8208;Cell Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared (696/725&#160;nm), water&#8208;soluble squaraine dye SO3SQ was presented for the chromofluorogenic detection of HClO/ClO&#8722;. SO3SQ detects HClO/ClO&#8722; in 100% PBS system and exhibits visible colorimetric change, high selectivity, pH&#8208;independence and negligible cytotoxicity. SO3SQ is successfully used to detect HClO/ClO&#8722; in environmental water and enables fluorescence imaging of exogenous/endogenous HClO/ClO&#8722; in live HepG2 cells.








Abstract
Hypochlorous acid/hypochlorite (HClO/ClO&#8722;), as critical biological reactive oxygen species (ROS), plays essential roles in numerous physiological and pathological processes. To enable sensitive detection of HClO/ClO&#8722; in environmental water samples and living cells, a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) water&#8208;soluble squaraine&#8208;based chromofluorogenic probe SO3SQ was developed. SO3SQ exhibits good water solubility, NIR detection wavelength (696&#160;nm/725&#160;nm), high selectivity, rapid response time (within seconds), visible colorimetric response, and minimal cytotoxicity. Furthermore, SO3SQ achieved quantitative HClO/ClO&#8722; detection in environmental water samples and realized real&#8208;time fluorescence imaging of exogenous/endogenous HClO/ClO&#8722; in HepG2 cells. This work provides new ideas for the future design of NIR water&#8208;soluble HClO/ClO&#8722; probes, while expanding the application of squaraine dyes as HClO/ClO&#8722; probes.

         <title>Modular Assembly of Macrocyclic Sulfonamides via Consecutive Cascade Ring Expansion Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methods for the efficient synthesis of macrocyclic sulfur(IV) compounds are rare. In this manuscript, a versatile strategy for the synthesis of macrocyclic sulfonamides is described using a modular three&#8208;stage protocol, including two consecutive cascade ring expansion reactions. The utility of this modular approach is showcased via the synthesis of a library of 42 diversely functionalized 13&#8208; and 14&#8208;membered macrocyclic sulfonamides.








Abstract
Sulfur(IV) groups and macrocycles are both important motifs in bioactive molecules of significant current interest in medicinal chemistry, but methods for the efficient synthesis of macrocyclic sulfur(IV) compounds are rare. In this manuscript, a modular, versatile strategy for the synthesis of macrocyclic sulfonamides is described, using consecutive ring expansion reactions. First, linear starting materials are assembled from simple building blocks. This is followed by two distinct cascade ring expansion reaction steps performed in sequence. The utility of this modular approach is showcased via the synthesis of a library of 42 diversely functionalized 13&#8208; and 14&#8208;membered macrocyclic sulfonamides. The use of consecutive ring expansions is key to the success of the protocol, ensuring the products are formed in overall good yields without requiring high&#8208;dilution conditions.

         <title>Balgacyclamide A: Structural Revision of the First Reported Total Synthesis and Evaluation of Oxazoline Synthesis via &#946;&#8208;Hydroxy Amides Dehydrative Cyclization Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic pathway for balgacyclamide A has been developed over 21 synthetic steps with an overall 5% yield. In this route, the absolute stereochemistry via the dehydrative cyclization is established, which helps to shed insight into errors within a previous groups claim of the total synthesis of balgacyclamide A. An epimer was also constructed to further our route via the dehydrative cyclization.








Abstract
A total synthesis of balgacyclamide A was reported for the first time in 2020, however, after multiple epimerization studies of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy amides dehydrative cyclization to access oxazolines, we proposed a configurational reassignment from the previous synthetic pathway. Balgacyclamide A is a macrocyclic hexapeptide with antiparasitic activity against Plasmodium falciparum and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. Chemically, its core contains six amino acids that undergo heterocyclization to form one thiazole and two oxazoline rings. Two of the six amino acids are L&#8208;threonines that play an important role in their synthetic pathway to achieve oxazolines with the right configuration upon epimerization at the &#946;&#8208;carbon. Thus, we investigated the effect of L&#8208;threonine and L&#8208;allothreonine &#946;&#8208;carbon epimerization via the Burgess reagent, diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST), and (NH4)6Mo7O24&#8226;4H2O catalyst to support previous oxazoline synthetic studies. Furthermore, the first total synthesis of balgacyclamide A and an epimer is reported via multiple synthetic key steps that involve a tandem sulfur incorporation, cyclization, and aromatization of the thiazole, and a late&#8208;stage &#946;&#8208;hydroxy amide Walden inversion to access both oxazolines.

         <title>A [3]Rotaxane Containing {Ti7Ga} Rings Linking CuII: Synthesis, Structure, and Spectroscopic Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extended hybrid inorganic&#8208;organic [2]&#8208; and [3]&#8208;rotaxanes are reported based on heterometallic rings with threads that link CuII complexes; the crystal structures are reported, and the solution behavior is investigated by double electron electron resonance spectroscopy methods.








Abstract
We report the synthesis of extended hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic rotaxanes based on (pyCH2NH2CH2CH2py)[TiIV7GaIIIO8(O2CtBu)16] (1) and (pyCH2NH2CH2py)[TiIV7GaIIIO8(O2CtBu)16] (3) building blocks, containing an anionic macrocycle and doubly pyridyl&#8208;terminated secondary ammonium threads. Reaction of 1 and 3 with [Cu(hfac)2] (hfac&#160;=&#160;1,1,1,5,5,5&#8208;hexafluoroacetylacetonate) gives {[Cu(hfac)2]3[1]2} (2) and {[Cu(hfac)2]2[3]} (4), respectively, which are characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The products are controlled by the differing steric demands imposed by the two arms of the thread. The structure of 2 is an extended [3]rotaxane, with two molecules of 1 binding to a central [Cu(hfac)2] molecule via the longer arm of the thread, and two [Cu(hfac)2] units terminating the structure at the shorter arm. The structure of 4, where both arms of the thread are short, is an extended [2]rotaxane terminated by two molecules of [Cu(hfac)2]. The Cu&#8230;Cu&#8230;Cu fragment in 2 is linear, with the central Cu lying on an inversion center and with a separation between the terminal copper ions of 31.3&#160;&#197;. Double Electron&#8208;Electron Resonance (DEER; also known as PELDOR) spectroscopy proves that the [3]rotaxane structure remains intact in solution, detecting both terminal&#8230;center and terminal&#8230;terminal Cu&#8230;Cu interactions, with orientation&#8208;selective measurements demonstrating that there is a rearrangement of the structure at the terminal positions on dissolution.

         <title>Ion&#8208;Pairing&#8208;Modulated Diradical Properties in Partially Conjugated Negatively Charged &#960;&#8208;Electronic Systems</title>

         <dc:description>
A quinonoidal dipyrrolyldiketone boron complex with an orthogonally arranged catechol unit in the dianionic form exhibited diradical properties, as observed from the singlet&#8211;triplet energy gaps (&#916;EST) that were modulated by coexisting countercations. &#916;EST values were controlled by the bridging boron moieties in the dianion diradicals.








Abstract
A quinonoidal dipyrrolyldiketone catecholate&#8208;boron complex, with two pyrrole&#8208;quinonemethide moieties bridged by a six&#8208;membered cross&#8208;conjugated unit, was synthesized to modulate the diradical character of the dianion formed upon deprotonation. The dianionic species exhibited near&#8208;infrared absorption and electron spin resonance (ESR) signals, confirming the diradical properties. Variable&#8208;temperature (VT) ESR spectra suggest the thermal excitation from the ground&#8208;state singlet diradical to the triplet diradical, providing singlet&#8211;triplet energy gaps modulated by coexisting cations and bridging boron moieties.

         <title>Unraveling the Ruthenium(VIII)&#8208;Mediated Oxidation of N&#8208;Hydroxy Pyrrolidines to Cyclic Nitrones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidation of N&#8208;hydroxy pyrrolidines to cyclic nitrones with ruthenium tetroxide proceeds via a concerted mechanism with a defined two&#8208;electron transfer direction. In 3&#8208;substituted derivatives, regioselectivity is mainly controlled by the steric hindrance of the substituent. Radical or stepwise pathways are ruled out by calculations.








Abstract
The oxidation of N&#8208;hydroxypyrrolidines to cyclic nitrones represents a valuable transformation in organic synthesis due to the synthetic utility of such nitrones. In this work, we present a detailed computational study of the oxidation of five&#8208;membered N&#8208;hydroxylamines using ruthenium tetroxide. Through density functional theory (DFT) calculations complemented by topological analyses of the electron localization function (ELF), we reveal a concerted yet highly asynchronous two&#8208;electron transfer mechanism. No intermediates as energy minima are identified, but the reaction trajectory lies near the borderline between stepwise and concerted pathways. Our findings indicate that regioselectivity in the oxidation process does not correlate with the electronic nature of the substituent at position 3, but is instead governed by steric hindrance effects that modulate the approach of the ruthenium tetroxide moiety. This steric control provides a rational explanation for the modest regioselectivity observed experimentally. Notably, the computational predictions align closely with experimental product distributions, lending strong support to the proposed mechanistic model.

         <title>Dipolar Molecular Motor Candidates with Planar Chirality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two prototypes of molecular motors with simultaneous implementation of planar chirality and a permanent dipole have been designed and synthesized in 7 steps with overall yields of 2.8 to 5.5%.








Abstract
Two molecular motor candidates built around ruthenium(II) centers featuring both planar chirality and a permanent dipole have been synthesized in seven steps. These motors incorporate desymmetrized cyclopentadienyl ligands bearing electron&#8208;donating (4&#8208;methoxyphenyl) and electron&#8208;withdrawing (3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl) groups in 1,2 or 1,3 relative positions, to induce strong dipolar moments and asymmetry helpful for unidirectional rotation. Two dipolar pentaarylcyclopentadienyl ligands were synthesized and coordinated to a Ru(II) trisindazolylborate complex functionalized with thioether moieties for surface anchoring. Structural analysis and DFT calculations revealed that dipole moments increase upon complexation, reaching 5.60 D and 4.58 D for the 1,2&#8208;CpAr5[Ru]Tp and 1,3&#8208;CpAr5[Ru]Tp complexes, respectively. Key synthetic challenges, such as low yields in Knoevenagel condensations and side reactions, were addressed through careful modulation of precursors, reaction conditions and cation selection. This study demonstrates the feasibility of integrating permanent dipoles and chirality into molecular motor design, which could offer an enhanced control over motion under STM&#8208;induced electric fields.

         <title>Enhanced Ring&#8208;Opening Efficiency of Fluorescence Photochromic Switches Based on Benzo[e]&#8208;Fused Dimethyldihydropyrene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorophore&#8208;BDHP conjugates demonstrate enhanced visible&#8208;light photoswitching through effective energy transfer. These robust molecular switches also operate in polymer thin film, facilitating solid&#8208;matrix photoisomerization. The strategy provides a flexible platform for advanced photonic and optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Fluorophores have a significant impact on the photoswitching efficiency of photochromic systems such as azobenzene, dithienylethene, and spiropyrans by facilitating energy transfer processes that modulate the photoisomerization dynamics. In this study, we investigate the effect of side&#8208;chain functionalization of benzo[e]&#8208;fused dimethyldihydropyrene (BDHP) photochromic system with carefully selected fluorophores, namely anthracene and coumarin, on the ring&#8208;opening photoisomerization efficiency to the corresponding cyclophanediene (BCPD) form. The corresponding phenyl and naphthyl derivatives and the unsubstituted parent BDHP were studied as controls. Comprehensive photophysical analyses, including absorption and emission spectroscopy, along with quantum yield measurements, demonstrate efficient energy transfer from the attached fluorophores to the BDHP core, leading to an enhanced BDHP&#8594;BCPD isomerization process. This energy transfer mechanism significantly enhances the photoisomerization efficiency, resulting in more than a twofold increase in the ring&#8208;opening quantum yield compared to the nonfunctionalized BDHP controls. Additionally, the efficiency of photoisomerization of the coumarin&#8208;substituted derivative was extended in the switching studies in embedded solid polymeric matrices with efficient reversible photoisomerization, photostability over multiple switching cycles, and an all&#8208;optical logic gate. These findings demonstrate a promising strategy to improve the performance of the BDHP photochromic systems and their potential applications in molecular logic devices in thin film.

         <title>Coal&#8208;Derived Carbon Support Regulates Interfacial Water Molecules toward Enhanced Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution on Platinum Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Increasing interfacial free H2O accelerates the alkaline HER, yet simple and effective methods remain scarce. This work shows that carbonyl and carboxyl groups on carbon supports greatly increase the ratio of free H2O via forming local hydrogen bondings. Consequently, a functional support derived from bituminous coal renders Pt with high activity and stability.








Abstract
Carbon&#8208;supported platinum (Pt) nanoparticles (NPs) are efficient electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) but suffer from suboptimal kinetics in alkaline media. While restructuring interfacial water molecules offers a promising route to enhance alkaline HER, simple and effective strategies remain scarce. Here, we prepared Pt NPs on different carbon supports with varied compositions of oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups (OFGs) and explored the correlation between the HER activity and the OFG composition. Structural analyses confirm negligible effects of the support on the morphology, size, or electronic states of Pt NPs. However, in situ Raman spectroscopy reveals that OFGs, including carbonyl (C&#160;=&#160;O) and carboxyl (COOH) groups increase the proportion of interfacial free water molecules by reorganizing local hydrogen bonding. Meanwhile, a bituminous coal&#8208;derived carbon (bitu@C), featuring abundant OFGs, was developed as a functional support for Pt NPs. The Pt/bitu@C catalyst achieves a mass activity of 1.33 A mgpt&#8722;1 at an overpotential of 100&#160;mV, significantly outperforming commercial carbon&#8208;supported counterparts, while exhibiting enhanced stability. This work highlights the critical role of OFGs in modulating water structures and provides a practical, coal&#8208;derived platform for engineering interfacial water molecules toward efficient alkaline HER kinetics.

         <title>Photoinduced Electron Transfer (PET) as Key to Accelerate the Cycloreversion Reaction of Arylquadricyclanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is demonstrated that the photoinduced cycloreversion of a methoxynaphthylquadricyclane in the presence of suitable photocatalysts gives quantitatively the corresponding norbornadiene. As this photochromic norbornadiene&#8208;quadricyclane cycle has favorable properties for light energy conversion, this method provides a useful tool for the targeted release of stored energy with high temporal and local control.








Abstract
The development of methods for the utilization of sustainable energy resources is an important scientific challenge. In one approach, the conversion and storage of solar light energy as chemical energy in a photoreaction has been established, namely as molecular solar thermal energy storage (MOST). In particular, the norbornadiene&#8208;quadricyclane system offers favorable photochemical and physicochemical properties for this purpose. However, the chemical reaction to release the stored energy, i.e., the cycloreversion of the quadricyclane, still requires improvement. In this context, we demonstrate that a fast and controlled cycloreversion of 2&#8208;(5&#8208;(1&#8208;methoxynaphthyl))quadricyclane can be accomplished in a photoinduced electron transfer (PET) reaction. Specifically, we identified 9&#8208;mesityl&#8208;10&#8208;methylacridinium, 9,10&#8208;dicyanoanthracene, and 9&#8208;nitrobenzo[b]quinolizinium as suitable catalysts that initiate the fast cycloreversion of the quadricyclane to the norbornadiene with visible light (420&#160;nm) and with low catalyst loading. At the same time, there is no significant loss of favorable MOST properties, namely half&#8208;life and energy storage density. Thus, this method provides an efficient, complementary tool for the targeted cycloreversion of quadricyclane with high temporal and local control, as required for MOST applications.

         <title>Versatile Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;H Arylation of Fluoroarenes with 2&#8208;Chloropyridine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct C&#9472;H arylation of fluoroarenes with 2&#8208;chloropyridines is enabled by a simple Pd/SPhos system in isopropyl acetate. The method uses inexpensive reactants and shows broad scope and high yields. DFT computations explain reactivity and selectivity. This practical strategy provides general access to fluorinated heteroarenes relevant across pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials science.








Abstract
Direct C&#9472;H arylation of fluoroarenes with 2&#8208;halopyridines remains underexplored, due to the low reactivity of both partners and the reliance on harsh conditions or toxic solvents. Herein, we report a general and sustainable method for the C&#9472;H arylation of fluoroarenes with 2&#8208;chloropyridines using Pd/SPhos as a simple catalytic system in isopropyl acetate. The protocol employs inexpensive starting materials, shows broad functional group tolerance, and delivers a wide range of 2&#8208;(fluorinated aryl)pyridines in up to 90% yield. Substrate scope studies uncovered key substituent effects on both coupling partners, while Density Functional Theory (DFT)&#8208;supported mechanistic analysis rationalized the observed reactivity and chemoselectivity. This research advances sustainable and practical methodologies for the synthesis of complex fluorinated aromatic compounds with potential applications in materials science, agrochemistry, and medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Enhanced Solid&#8208;State Luminescence of Supramolecular Tessellation Assemblies Through F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer From Counterions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work explores how supramolecular tessellation enhances fluorescence quantum yield and induces redshift. Through self&#8208;assembly, it suppresses intramolecular rotation and vibration (RIR) that reduce nonradiative decay, boosting efficiency and shifting emission.








Abstract
The development of straightforward strategies for constructing supramolecular tessellations with enhanced solid&#8208;state luminescence has attracted growing interest in supramolecular chemistry and luminescent materials. Herein, we report the formation of diverse supramolecular tiling patterns by combining electron&#8208;deficient bipyridinium&#8208;based cationic macrocycles with either naphthalene&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonate or naphthalene&#8208;2&#8208;sulfonate counterions directly. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals distinct tessellated superstructures assembled from 3,3&#8242;&#8208;bipyridinium macrocycles, stabilized by a network of electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; stacking, and CH&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions. These assemblies exhibit red&#8208;shifted and enhanced solid&#8208;state fluorescence, attributed to F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the macrocycles and their aromatic counterions. Crystallographic and computational studies provide molecular&#8208;level insights into the noncovalent forces governing both the assembly process and luminescence enhancement. This work establishes a facile design strategy for constructing luminescent supramolecular tessellations and offers a deeper understanding of their structure&#8211;property relationships.

         <title>Hole&#8208;Selective Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers Overlaid on NiOx or PEDOT:PSS for Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells &#8211; An Overview of Recent Characterization Methods</title>

         <dc:description>
Successfully applying self&#8208;assembled monolayers with hole&#8208;selectivity for lead&#8208;free tin perovskite solar cells requires judicious investigation with appropriately powerful characterization methods, in addition to efforts in the development of new materials and processing. We herein review the diverse characterization methods, the results obtained through them, and how to interpret those results.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) with high hole&#8208;selectivity have seen growing use in the research realm of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Even though SAMs can be used solely, their hole&#8208;selective performance is amplifiable on a p&#8208;type underlayer such as nickel oxide (NiOx) or poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS). This is especially prominent in lead&#8208;free tin&#8208;based PSCs. Herein, we review recent relevant publications on hole&#8208;selective SAMs overlaid on NiOx or PEDOT:PSS for tin PSCs. We first examine the characteristic features of the SAMs introduced in each publication. Since SAMs can affect the surface properties, interfacial properties, and perovskite quality, we focus on how these aspects are characterized and which methods are employed. In particular, the employed methods are various spanning computational simulations, microscopy imaging and electrochemical, spectroscopic, and crystallographic measurements. Through this review, we aim to encourage researchers to explore these aspects and methodologies in future research on hole&#8208;selective SAMs for tin PSCs.

This is especially prominent in lead-free tin-based PSCs. Herein, we review recent relevant publications on hole-selective SAMs overlaid on NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; or PEDOT:PSS for tin PSCs. We first examine the characteristic features of the SAMs introduced in each publication. Since SAMs can affect the surface properties, interfacial properties, and perovskite quality, we focus on how these aspects are characterized and which methods are employed. In particular, the employed methods are various spanning computational simulations, microscopy imaging and electrochemical, spectroscopic, and crystallographic measurements. Through this review, we aim to encourage researchers to explore these aspects and methodologies in future research on hole-selective SAMs for tin PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Decoupling Redox Potentials and Excited State Energies in Substituted Chromium(III) Chromophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox and excited state properties of organic and precious metal CT photocatalysts are strongly entangled. In contrast, redox potentials of polypyridine chromium(III) complexes, that feature purely metal&#8208;centered SF states, are selectively tuned by incremental substituent effects of the CF3 group, while excited state energies and lifetimes remain unaffected. Such precisely designed chromophores provide a unique tool for the systematic investigation of elementary reaction steps relevant to photoredox catalytic cycles.








Abstract
Redox and excited state properties of classical organic and precious metal charge&#8208;transfer (CT) photocatalysts can be tuned by substituent effects&#8212;however, not independently, as redox and chromophore units are strongly entangled. In contrast, substituent effects should selectively address electrochemical properties of photoactive complexes based on metal&#8208;centered spin&#8208;flip (SF) excited states lacking CT character without compromising excited state properties. Yet, detailed structure&#8208;activity relationships for SF chromophores are lacking. We demonstrate that the redox potentials of polypyridine chromium(III) complexes, that feature purely metal&#8208;centered SF states, can be selectively tuned by incremental substituent effects, while the excited state energies and lifetimes remain unaffected. This delivers a unique series of chromophores with identical optical properties, but redox potentials tuned by increments. We believe, that such precisely designed chromophore series provide a unique tool for the systematic investigation of photoredox reactions and recombination processes relevant to photoredox catalytic cycles.

         <title>(2&#8208;Phosphinophenyl)aluminum Dichloride Complexes as Intramolecular Al/P Frustrated Lewis Pairs for Ketone, Ester, and Imine Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three 2&#8208;phosphinophenylaluminum dichloride complexes were synthesized and characterized as novel intramolecular FLPs. These FLP systems exhibit high Lewis acidity and effectively activate challenging substrates including aliphatic ketones, imines, and esters. DFT analysis revealed that strain release and Al&#8211;P dynamics govern their reactivity.








Abstract
(2&#8208;Phosphinophenyl)aluminum dichloride complexes were synthesized and their frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) reactivity was investigated. Selective mono&#8208;substitution of AlCl3 with lithioarenes was achieved by introducing sterically demanding substituents&#8212;tert&#8208;butyl, ethyl, or PCy2&#8212;at the 6&#8208;position of the phenylene linker, effectively suppressing over&#8208;substitution and enabling successful isolation of the target complexes. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopic analyses confirmed the formation of a four&#8208;membered P&#8211;Al&#8211;C&#8211;C core structure. These complexes function as Al/P&#8208;based FLPs capable of activating simple carbonyl and imine compounds, including aliphatic ketones, prop&#8208;2&#8208;ynoate esters, and N&#8208;arylimines. The mechanism of carbonyl activation by these Al/P FLPs was elucidated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Synthesis of Cyclobutane&#8208;Containing Tricyclic &#946;&#8208;Lactams Based on a Saturated Scaffold Enabled by Iron&#8208;catalysed [2&#160;+&#160;2]&#8208;Cycloaddition</title>

First syntheses of pyrrolidine&#8208;, piperidine&#8208;, and azepane tricyclic &#946;&#8208;lactams based on a saturated scaffold are achieved through an Fe&#8208;pyrimidinediimine&#8208;catalysed [2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition of allylamines analogues followed by photo&#8208;induced intramolecular C&#9472;H insertion. The cage&#8208;like &#946;&#8208;lactam scaffolds enable strain&#8208;release access to methylphenidate analogues and expand the three&#8208;dimensional chemical space.








Abstract
Highly saturated, three&#8208;dimensional &#946;&#8208;lactams are valuable motifs in medicinal chemistry, yet general routes to cyclobutane&#8208;fused analogues remain scarce. Here we disclose a concise strategy that delivers pyrrolidine&#8208;, piperidine&#8208;, and azepane&#8208;based tricyclic &#946;&#8208;lactams. A pyrimidinediimine&#8208;iron catalyst first constructs the cyclobutane ring and the N&#8208;heterocycle in one step through an intermolecular [2&#160;+&#160;2]&#8208;cycloaddition of allyl amines; a subsequent photochemical intramolecular C&#9472;H insertion then forges the &#946;&#8208;lactam. The major products adopt rigid, cage&#8208;like conformations confirmed for the pyrrolidine series by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Comprehensive conformer sampling (using CREST), DFT&#8208;calculated NMR shifts, and DP4 statistical analysis establish the stereochemistry across the library. Strain&#8208;release opening of the &#946;&#8208;lactam ring furnishes methylphenidate analogues in a single step, underscoring the scaffolds&#8217; synthetic versatility. Comparative studies on the corresponding bicyclic systems highlight the unique three&#8208;dimensionality imparted by the additional cyclobutane ring, further expanding the toolbox for lead&#8208;oriented synthesis.

         <title>Stereoselective Syntheses of Cyclic Microsclerodermin Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Six different cyclic microsclerodermin derivatives are obtained from l&#8208;xylose and d&#8208;arabinose via stereoselective Sakurai allylations and photochemical Arndt&#8208;Eistert homologations.








Abstract
Starting from l&#8208;xylose and d&#8208;arabinose, six different cyclic microscleroderma derivatives were successfully obtained. Key steps of the syntheses are, on the one hand, Sakurai allylations, whose stereochemical course depends on the Lewis acid used, and on the other hand, photochemical Wolff rearrangements in the presence of complex aminofuranosides. Finally, aromatic side chains were introduced via cross metathesis.

         <title>The N&#8208;Bromo&#8208;Hammick Intermediate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spectroscopic and computational analysis uncovers the &#963;2&#963;*0 electronic structure of the N&#8208;bromo&#8208;Hammick intermediate, a singlet N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene isolated in solid neon, whose back&#8208;isomerization to bromopyridine proceeds via a planar transition state.








Abstract
We report the characterization of bromopyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene, the N&#8208;bromo&#8208;Hammick intermediate, isolated in solid neon at 4.4&#160;K. Computations (B2PLYP, NEVPT2), IR, and UV/vis spectroscopy characterize this intermediate as a singlet carbene with a vacant &#963;*&#8208;type frontier orbital. This unusual electronic structure (&#963;2&#963;*0) allows the carbene to isomerize to its more stable pyridine tautomer via a planar transition state, avoiding the deviation from planarity seen in other singlet carbenes. The compound's reaction with molecular hydrogen faces a minor but prohibitive barrier (8.4&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1) at the low temperatures of the experiment.

         <title>Hydrogen Bond Reformation in Tetracarboxylic Acid&#8208;Based Organic Frameworks with Square Lattice Topology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural transformation in hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) via bond cleavage and reformation is highlighted. Sql&#8208;type HOFs composed of tetracarboxylic acids bearing 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxy&#8208;o&#8208;terphenyl moieties are shown to be particularly prone to H&#8208;bond reformations. Analysis of molecular conformation and crystal packing provides design insights for controlling H&#8208;bond reformation, guiding the development of dynamic porous materials.








Abstract
The weak and reversible nature of hydrogen bonds endows porous materials with structural flexibility. In this article, we highlight structural transformations involving the cleavage and reformation of hydrogen bonds&#8212;termed H&#8208;bond reformation. To enable control over H&#8208;bond reformation through molecular design, we examine and discuss key structural features. Particular attention is given to tetracarboxylic acids bearing 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxy&#8208;o&#8208;terphenyl moieties as scaffolds for inducing H&#8208;bond reformation. These insights are expected to guide the rational design of dynamic porous materials with tunable properties and stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior.

         <title>Coordination Chemistry of Phosphinidene Stabilized by Mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic Carbene and Catalysis</title>

Abstract
Abnormal N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;stabilized phosphinidene, a class of low&#8208;valent phosphorus compounds, has been recently stabilized by an isolated abnormal NHC. However, its coordination chemistry with various metal ions remained unexplored. Herein, we have explored the coordination chemistry of a mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic phosphinidene (mNHP,1), stabilized by an abnormal N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (aNHC) with various metals (Cu, Zn, and Sn) to afford trimetallic, bimetallic, and monometallic complexes, respectively. All these complexes were characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. We have also explored the catalytic activity of one of these complexes for alkynylation of trifluoromethyl ketones and found that mNHP (1)&#8208;bound trimetallic Cu&#8208;complex is an excellent catalyst for this reaction with up to 97% isolated yield under low catalyst loading (3 mol%).

         <dc:description>
NMR evidence shows that tin(IV) chloride complexes with N,N&#8217;&#8208;bidentate sulfur diimide (SDI) ligands exist in a concentration&#8208;dependent equilibrium with acetonitrile, favoring displacement of SDI in dilute solutions. Voltammetry of only the bis&#8208;acetonitrile adduct shows deposition of tin(0) metal upon reduction, which seems to be suppressed in the presence of SDI, suggesting that SDIs may operate as redox&#8208;active ligands.








Abstract
A series of Sn(IV) chloride complexes with sulfur diimide (SDI, R&#8208;NSN&#8208;R) ligands are presented, including structural characterization of first&#8208;in&#8208;class complexes of bidentate diaryl&#8208;SDIs, [SnCl4{&#954;2&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;S(NAr)2}] (Ar&#160;=&#160;4&#8208;X&#8208;C6H4&#8208;), and an oxygen&#8208;coordinated sulfinylamine, [SnCl4{&#954;1&#8208;O&#8208;OSNPh}2]. As part of the comprehensive experimental and DFT computational investigation, 119Sn NMR analysis revealed a dynamic exchange equilibrium in acetonitrile between SDI ligands and solvent, providing insight into their complicated solution&#8208;state chemical and electrochemical behavior. Voltammetric experiments show that, despite this dynamic equilibrium, the SDI ligands appear to suppress typical Sn(IV) reduction pathways. While tentative due to the complex behavior, this suggests that SDIs are functioning as redox&#8208;active (RA) ligands. In conjunction with our previous systematic characterization of diaryl&#8208;SDIs, these findings highlight their potential as an easily derivatized and highly redox&#8208;tunable category of RA ligand and emphatically warrant further investigation.

         <title>Coacervate Vesicles as Adaptive Platforms for Synthetic Biology and Smart Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 54, September 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coacervate vesicles are emerging protocells that merge coacervates&#8217; functionality within membranised architectures. Their diverse formation mechanisms from coacervate droplets yield tunable, responsive systems with broad potential, from synthetic biology to smart materials, offering a powerful, programmable platform for next&#8208;generation bioinspired technologies.








Abstract
Coacervate vesicles represent a versatile and emerging class of protocells that combine the dynamic properties of coacervate microdroplets with the structural advantages of membrane&#8208;bound systems. Leveraging features such as selective molecular uptake, enhanced reactivity, and dynamicity, they offer a promising platform for both fundamental research and technological applications in synthetic biology. In this concept, we introduce a classification of coacervate vesicles based on their formation mechanisms and energetic landscapes, highlighting how their formation routes give rise to protocells with distinct structural and dynamic properties. Furthermore, we explore how these features translate into potential applications, including artificial life&#8208;like systems, complex communication networks, adaptive soft materials, and smart drug&#8208;delivery platforms. While the field is still in its infancy, the simplicity, versatility, and programmability of coacervate vesicles position them as a powerful framework for engineering next&#8208;generation synthetic life&#8208;like systems.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Induced Stabilization and Folding Pathways of &#945;&#8208;Helical Peptides: A Computational Investigation Using Steered Molecular Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 54, September 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study employed molecular simulations to investigate the stabilization of &#945;&#8208;helical structures in HFIP compared to aqueous environments. SMD simulations demonstrated the stretching polypeptide chains to effectively preserve &#945;&#8208;helical conformations and enhance structural stability through solvation effects.








Abstract
Fluorinated polar solvents, such as hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP), are known to denature proteins into &#945;&#8208;helix&#8208;rich structures, a phenomenon of interest in protein engineering and fiber science. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations offer a valuable approach to explore protein folding mechanisms. In the present study, steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations were conducted to stretch the polypeptide models along the &#945;&#8208;helix axis in different solvents. The potential of mean force (PMF) associated with nonequilibrium stretching of the polypeptide chain was higher in HFIP than in water and varied depending on amino acid composition and degree of polymerization. HFIP molecules preferentially concentrated in grooves of &#945;&#8208;helical polypeptides. Stretching the polypeptides in HFIP resulted in the formation of 310&#8208;helix structures, suggesting that local solvation enhances structural stability. Additional SMD simulations of Trp&#8208;cage, a mini&#8208;protein driven by hydrophobic collapse in protein folding, showed partial unfolding of the &#945;&#8208;helix region and global extension of both termini. The resulting PMF profiles indicate that &#945;&#8208;helices are formed in the early stages of Trp&#8208;cage folding. This study offers an analytical framework that can be extended to more complex amino acid sequences and proteins with diverse structural motifs. HFIP appears to play a central role in the &#945;&#8208;helical transformation of higher&#8208;order protein structures.

         <title>Halogen Bond&#8208;Tuning of Responsive Supramolecular Amino Acid Hydrogels</title>

XB strongly influences both solid&#8208;state packing and rheological properties of hydrogels of a tailored halogenated Fmoc&#8208;amino acid in biomimetic environments. Interestingly, the addition of effective XB&#8208;acceptors (Nu) to the gelation medium increased gel stiffness, preluding to the possible future development of XB&#8208;responsive amino acid hydrogels in anion sensing, or for the encapsulation of specific guest molecules.








Abstract
N&#8208;Fmoc&#8208;pentafluoro&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine (F5) forms stable supramolecular hydrogels, mainly through &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking of its aromatic groups. Hydrogen bonding&#8208;driven co&#8208;assembly of F5 with suitable partner molecules has been reported to affect the gel's properties, in accordance with what is observed in their corresponding co&#8208;crystal structures. Herein, we extended this hydrogel modulation strategy to halogen bonding (XB) interactions by introducing an XB&#8208;donating iodine atom in the para&#8208;position of the F5 phenyl ring. Under conditions mimicking biological environments, both crystal packing and hydrogelation of the resulting N&#8208;Fmoc&#8208;4&#8208;iodo&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;phenylalanine (IF4), were significantly affected by iodine&#8208;&#960; interactions. Slower fibril formation kinetics and reduced strength of IF4 hydrogels in phosphate buffer solution, compared to F5, mirrored iodine&#8208;induced changes in Fmoc stacking in the solid state. Notably, the addition of strong XB&#8208;acceptors &#8211; such as iodide anions or pyridine&#8208;containing substrates, like vitamin B3 &#8211; induced a significant increase in gel stiffness. These findings suggest the possibility of exploiting properly tailored Fmoc&#8208;amino acids as &#8220;XB&#8208;responsive&#8221; hydrogelators, useful for anion sensing applications or for trapping bioactive molecules.

Aryl substituents navigate the course of Scholl&#8208;type oxidative coupling in tetraarylthiophenes, enabling selective mono&#8208; versus dual cyclizations via electronic step discrimination and control. Guided by Hammett &#963;p constants, this study deciphers reactivity trends, face selectivity, excellent control, and coupling pathways&#8212;offering a predictive blueprint for regioselective &#960;&#8208;architecture construction.








Abstract
Scholl&#8208;type oxidative aryl&#8208;aryl coupling is a powerful strategy for constructing extended &#960;&#8208;systems, yet achieving regioselectivity and stepwise control remains a formidable challenge. Here, we report a systematic study on tetraarylthiophene (TAT) frameworks, revealing how subtle electronic effects of aryl substituents govern C&#9472;C bond formation efficiency, selectivity, and pathways. Guided by electrochemical potentials and Hammett &#963;p constants, we establish a reactivity trend&#8212;OMe&#160;&gt;&#160;Me&#160;&gt;&#160;tBu&#160;&gt;&#160;H&#160;&gt;&#160;Ph&#160;&gt;&#160;F&#160;&gt;&#160;Cl&#160;&gt;&#160;CHO&#160;&gt;&#160;CF3&#8212;revealing that electron&#8208;rich aryls promote efficient coupling, while electron&#8208;deficient groups suppress reactivity. Crucially, face&#8208;selective mono&#8208;cyclization products (PTs) are achieved by electronic step discrimination, where strategically pairing electronically distinct aryls steers homo&#8208; versus cross&#8208;coupling outcomes, enabling precise control over sequential couplings. Our findings unveil a simple yet powerful electronic map to predict coupling outcomes, product evolution, and opens a rational path to design regioselective oxidative cyclizations in polyaryl architectures toward precise &#960;&#8208;frameworks.

         <title>What Makes a Branched Aromatic Compound a Crystallization Chaperone? Insights from a Comparison of Three Organic Scaffolds</title>

         <dc:description>
The ability to accommodate guest molecules of many different shapes in crystal lattices has been tested for teraaryl derivatives of porphyrin, spirobifluorene, and adamantane. The latter appears to offer the most favorable properties, which may be at least partially due to low activation barriers for the interconversion of rotamers.








Abstract
Some tetraaryladamantane (TAA) octa&#8208; and tetraethers have the ability to crystallize into well&#8208;ordered lattices without full desolvation. In many cases, the solvates then yield high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray crystal structures of the encapsulated liquids. To shed light on this unusual effect of TAAs as crystallization chaperones, we have synthesized a series of spirobiflourene and porphyrin derivatives with four phenyl arms also found in TAA chaperones. Despite the structural similarity, neither of the non&#8208;TAA compounds showed promising crystallization properties. Six new X&#8208;ray crystal structures were obtained, but neither gave a high&#8208;resolution structure of an encapsulated guest. Quantum chemical computations suggest that conformational changes have low activation barriers for the TAAs, which may help to adapt to the structures of guest molecules in tightly packed arrangements. These findings on supramolecular chemistry in the crystalline state may help to design new chaperones with improved properties.

         <title>In Situ Electrochemical Synthesis of Redox&#8208;Active o&#8208;Hydroquinone Metabolite of Flufenamic Acid on MWCNT Surface: Lifespan Extension in C. elegans via SOD Pathway</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 54, September 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an electrochemical strategy to generate the redox&#8208;active flufenamic acid&#8208;drug metabolite, FFA&#8208;Redox, which extends the lifespan of C. elegans worm&#8208;by up to 80% under pathogenic infection. The metabolite reduces intracellular ROS levels and enhances superoxide dismutase expression, suggesting a potent antioxidant&#8208;driven &#8220;de&#8208;aging&#8221; mechanism with promising biomedical potential.








Abstract
The search for drugs that extend lifespan in human&#8208;like biological models is a frontier area in biomedical research. In this study, we report a novel electrochemical approach using flufenamic acid (FFA), a widely known nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug (NSAID), to generate and detect its pharmacologically active metabolites. Electrochemical oxidation of FFA on multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes(MWCNT)&#8208;modified electrode yielded hydroxylated derivatives, primarily 4&#8208;hydroxy FFA (m/z 297.05&#160;g/mol) and a polyhydroxylated product termed FFA&#8208;Redox (m/z 243.05&#160;g/mol), as surface&#8208;confined species (MWCNT@FFA&#8208;Redox). To establish biological relevance, Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) were exposed to FFA, resulting in in vivo formation of metabolites identical to those generated electrochemically. This confirmed the physiological significance of the electrosynthesized compounds. Lifespan assays demonstrated that FFA&#8208;Redox prolonged the survival of C. elegans by up to 40% under Klebsiella pneumoniae infection and by up to 80% under Staphylococcus aureus infection. This protective effect was attributed to reduced levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mechanistic insights suggest that FFA&#8208;Redox induces a &#8220;de&#8208;aging&#8221; response by enhancing the expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD), a key antioxidant enzyme activated during oxidative stress.

Showcasing sono&#8208; and mechanochemistry: A sonochemistry&#8208; and mechanochemistry&#8208;assisted dual&#8208;synthetic approach for biologically and synthetically promising cyanomethyl carboxylates as a rapid, high&#8208;yielding, and robust alternative synthetic protocol under metal catalyst&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free conditions.








Abstract
We herein disclose a dual synthetic approach involving sonochemical and mechanochemical strategies for a diverse series of cyanomethyl esters of carboxylic acids. Both synthetic protocols offer a straightforward, efficient, and practical alternative to preparing this important class of biologically and synthetically promising organic compounds. Significant advantages of the newly developed methods include mild reaction conditions, avoidance of any metal catalysts and external oxidants, shorter reaction times (in minutes), good to excellent yields, broad substrate scope and tolerance of other various functional groups, gram&#8208;scale applicability, and reusability of the solid surface.

         <title>Cyanostilbenes as Selective Chloride Carriers Relying on CH&#8208;anion Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 54, September 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This manuscript presents a series of eight small compounds based on the &#945;&#8208;cyanostilbene motif and with different substituents. Three of these compounds show good rates of chloride transport, as well as selectivity for chloride over hydroxide, bicarbonate, and fluoride anions.








Abstract
Achieving selectivity is one of the challenges in developing anion receptors for transmembrane transport. This can be achieved through larger molecular designs that encapsulate the anion efficiently or by using alternative binding motifs instead of the most commonly used NH&#8208;based hydrogen bond donors. In this study, we present a series of small chloride receptors based on &#945;&#8208;cyanostilbenes that use CH&#8208;based hydrogen bonds. By varying the substituents, we discovered that the compound containing four trifluoromethyl groups and a nitro group in addition to the two cyano groups exhibited the greatest affinity for chloride and the fastest chloride transport rates, surpassing the performance of reported triazole&#8208;based compound. Furthermore, this compound showed clear selectivity for transporting chloride over hydroxide, bicarbonate, and fluoride anions. The activity, selectivity, and deliverability of this compound make it a promising candidate for the treatment of chloride channelopathies.

Indeno[2.1&#8208;b]fluorenes and fluoreno[2,3&#8208;b]fluorenes having (trialkylsilyl)ethynyl groups dimerize spontaneously to yield the cyclodimers in the yields ranging from virtually zero to quantitative depending on the alkyl group. The regioselectivity of the bond formation (Head versus Tail) is also dependent on the alkyl group. These remarkable effects are attributed to the attractive London dispersion force between the &#960;&#8208; system and the alkyl groups.








Abstract
We present herein a systematic study on the cyclodimerization of (trialkylsilyl)ethynyl&#8208;substituted derivatives of indeno[2.1&#8208;b]fluorene and fluoreno[2,3&#8208;b]fluorene, which incorporate an open&#8208;shell meta&#8208;quinodimethane (m&#8208;QDM) unit. Our investigation focuses on the influence of different alkyl groups (methyl, isopropyl, or cyclohexyl) attached to the silyl moiety. Upon generation from the precursor diols via treatment with SnCl2, these m&#8208;QDM derivatives yielded cyclodimers with an anti&#8208;configuration. The reaction yields varied significantly, ranging from virtually zero to quantitative, depending on the steric bulk of the alkyl group. Furthermore, the regioselectivity of bond formation (Head versus Tail) with respect to the ethynyl&#8211;allenyl radical resonance forms was also notably affected by the choice of alkyl group. These remarkable observations are attributed to attractive London dispersion forces operating between the &#960;&#8208;system and the alkyl groups. Crucially, the degree of size matching between these components dictates both the dimerization efficiency and the regioselectivity of the bond&#8208;forming process.

This paper describes the synthesis, structural characterization, and reactivity of the first stable 1&#8208;stannavinylidene&#8208;NHC complex, that is, a neutral monomeric compound with a C&#160;=&#160;Sn &#960;&#8208;bond, which is a heavier group&#8208;14 analogue of vinylidene. The vinylidene&#8208;type character of the molecule was confirmed by spectroscopic means, X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, theoretical calculations, and a reactivity study.








Abstract
The first stable 1&#8208;stannavinylidene&#8208;NHC complex with bulky silyl substituents has been obtained from the retro&#8208;dimerization of cyclic 1,3&#8208;bis(stannylene) with an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC). To accomplish the retro&#8208;dimerization of cyclic 1,3&#8208;bis(stannylene), a suitably sized NHC is required. Both in the solid state and in solution, 1&#8208;stannavinylidene&#8208;NHC complex is characterized by the presence of a C&#160;=&#160;Sn &#960; bond. When treated with SnCl2, 1&#8208;stannavinylidene&#8208;NHC complex undergoes an addition reaction to afford the corresponding stable gem&#8208;bis(chlorostannylene).

         <title>Microwave Radiation for Organolithium Chemistry: Mechanistic Studies on the Direct &#945;&#8208;Metalation of a Tertiary Amine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 54, September 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the use of microwave radiation to lithium chemistry, specifically in the kinetically hindered deprotonation of a tertiary amine at high temperatures without polar additives. The amine acts as substrate and deaggregation agent as shown by a solid&#8208;state structure. The lithium compounds remain stable at the harsh conditions and the deprotonated amine is storage&#8208;stable, facilitating diverse follow&#8208;up chemistry.








Abstract
Deprotonation reactions with lithium alkyls exhibit a high temperature dependency. However, the reactivity of lithium alkyls with conventionally used Lewis bases limits their deprotonation capability of more challenging substrates like tertiary amines. Therefore, we have focused on the use of high but exactly set reaction temperatures by usage of microwave radiation in the deprotonation reaction of a tertiary amine in the absence of polar additives. Our study proves the robustness of lithium alkyls, like t&#8208;butyllithium and &#945;&#8208;metalated tertiary amines under microwave conditions. A solid&#8208;state structure of the prelithiation aggregate and quantum chemical calculations offer an insight into the mechanism, revealing that the substrate amine performs as Lewis base for deaggregation itself. By our method, N&#8208;methylpiperidine was deprotonated without any intermediate or possibly toxic reaction steps, solvents, or additives, solely with t&#8208;butyllithium in the microwave with 56% yield. By using design of experiments we identified the most important factors for a successful deprotonation, revealing the closed reaction conditions under pressure and an excess of amine to be crucial. This investigation proves the high potential of microwave radiation in lithium chemistry, as it provides high but exact energy and introduces new possibilities for deprotonation reactions to overcome high kinetic reaction barriers.

By our method, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methylpiperidine was deprotonated without any intermediate or possibly toxic reaction steps, solvents, or additives, solely with &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-butyllithium in the microwave with 56% yield. By using &lt;i&gt;design of experiments&lt;/i&gt; we identified the most important factors for a successful deprotonation, revealing the closed reaction conditions under pressure and an excess of amine to be crucial. This investigation proves the high potential of microwave radiation in lithium chemistry, as it provides high but exact energy and introduces new possibilities for deprotonation reactions to overcome high kinetic reaction barriers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phytic Acid Assisted Preparation of Cu3P/Cu@C Composites as High Performance Anodes for Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 54, September 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyaniline was polymerized and deposited on the surface of Cu nanowire@carbon (C) nanocore&#8208;shells, and utilizing phytic acid as phosphorus source, a unique Cu3P/Cu@C composite spherical structure with with N,P&#8208;codoped graphitic carbon nanotubes entwined has been fabricated through a simple high&#8208;temperature annealing. Such porous and doped Cu3P&#8208;carbon anodes show excellent rate capability with ultra&#8208;long service life at current density up to 2000 mA/g.








Abstract
Phosphorus&#8208;based anodes show new perspectives in high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries, but harsh synthesis and severe capacity attenuation seriously preclude their practical application. Here, Cu nanowire@carbon (C) nanocore&#8208;shells are designed to utilize as sacrificial templates for polyaniline loading, and with the assistance of phytic acid (PA), a novel Cu3P/Cu@C microsphere composite structure is successfully constructed via direct thermal annealing, in which heteroatom&#8208;doped graphitic carbon nanotubes are wounded with each other and firmly entangled on spheres. The polyaniline polymerization by (NH4)2S2O8 and the addition of PA are indispensable for the unique Cu3P sphere formation. Both the spherical Cu3P structure and its doped carbon encapsulating could largely alleviate volume expansion during lithium storage, while the intertwined carbon nanotubes provide fast transport channels for Li+. Therefore, as anode, it exhibits relatively stable cyclic performance, and after 10,000 cycles at an ultra&#8208;high rate of 2000 mA/g, it still maintain a capacity of 278.57 mAh/g with capacity retention of 73.12%. Through analysis, large specific surface area and multi&#8208;level pore distribution of the optimized Cu3P&#8208;carbon anode, and the extended interlayer spacing of doped carbon are conducive to the reversible intercalation and adsorption of Li+. Electrochemical mechanism analysis also confirms its dramatic surface pseudo&#8208;capacitance contribution and excellent reaction kinetics.

         <title>Mechanochemical Preferential Bromination at the &#945;&#8208;Position of Activated Naphthalenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 54, September 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study focuses on the mechanochemical pathway for &#945;&#8208;bromination of &#946;&#8208;functionalized naphthalenes. This uses N&#8208;bromosuccinimide as a mild brominating precursor and highlights the tolerance and limitations of functional groups used. This applies on gram scale synthesis and production of various useful intermediates.








Abstract
This study is the exploration of a solvent&#8208;free, mechanochemically enabled sustainable pathway for rapid and preferential selective &#945;&#8208;bromination of &#946;&#8208;functionalized naphthalenes using N&#8208;bromosuccinimide. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis and diverse post&#8208;functionalizations demonstrate the versatility of the &#945;&#8208;brominated &#946;&#8208;functionalized naphthalenes in organic synthesis, pharmaceuticals, materials, and catalysis. This green and environment&#8208;benign approach, having E&#8208;factor of 0.5, offers high yields up to 98% within 30 minutes and highlights broad functional electron&#8208;donating groups (EDGs) along with limitations of electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (EWGs).

         <title>3&#8242;&#8208;C&#8208;Extended TNA: De Novo Synthesis, Enhanced Exonuclease Resistance, and Functional siRNA 3&#8242;&#8208;Overhang Modifications Without Compromising Gene Silencing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 54, September 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed and synthesized 3&#8242;&#8208;C&#8208;extended TNA analogs (ApioNA and BpioNA) through asymmetric aldol synthesis. These analogs, modified at the 3&#8242;&#8208;terminal of oligonucleotides, display significant exonuclease resistance, particularly BpioNA, which has a 60&#8208;fold increase in half&#8208;life compared to dT. Furthermore, both analogs maintain full gene&#8208;silencing efficacy when integrated into the 3&#8242;&#8208;overhang positions of siRNA, highlighting their potential in nucleic acid therapeutics.








Abstract
The 3&#8242;&#8208;overhang of siRNAs is crucial for RISC assembly and stability, yet it is susceptible to nuclease degradation, significantly limiting its therapeutic applications. To address this challenge, we developed 3&#8242;&#8208;C&#8208;extended threose nucleic acid (TNA) analogs (ApioNA and BpioNA) using an asymmetric aldol synthesis strategy. Our results demonstrate that the BpioNA modification provides exceptional nuclease resistance, exhibiting a 60&#8208;fold increase in half&#8208;life compared to dT, while maintaining full gene silencing activity. Structural modeling revealed that these novel analogs preserve critical interactions with the Ago2 PAZ domain through adaptive binding geometries. This work not only addresses the stability&#8208;activity trade&#8208;off in siRNA design but also provides fundamental insights into the structure&#8208;activity relationships (SARs) at the 3&#8242;&#8208;terminus, paving the way for the development of durable RNAi therapeutics.

         <title>Photoswitchable Merocyanine&#8208;Amphiphiles with Programmable Self&#8208;Assembly Times</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 54, September 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A merocyanine&#8208;based amphiphile self&#8208;assembles in water to form visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive ellipsoids that can be disassembled with visible light and reform abruptly &#8764;70&#160;minutes after the light is switched off. The kinetics of the light&#8208;induced assembly/disassembly process is controllable by incorporating different co&#8208;surfactants.








Abstract
A merocyanine&#8208;based amphiphile was self&#8208;assembled into ellipsoids that can be disassembled by irradiation with visible light and reassemble in the dark after a delay of &#8764;70&#160;minutes. Above a threshold concentration, the reassembly occurs when the ratio of protonated merocyanine to spiropyran reaches 7:3, suggesting both isomers are involved in the assembly. The thermal isomerization of the amphiphile when assembled (half&#8208;life &#8764;13&#160;minutes) is significantly slower than that in dilute solution (half&#8208;life &#8764;3.6&#160;minutes). The self&#8208;assembly behavior was confirmed by UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), small&#8208;angle neutron scattering (SANS) and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS). The delay between the isomerization and the assembly processes can be tuned between minutes and hours by adding differently charged co&#8208;surfactants.

We report a new strategy to prepare a pomegranate&#8208;like nano&#8208;confined silicon&#8208;carbon composites with excellent performance through a combination of wet chemical reduction methods and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique. The Si/XC@C&#8208;0.2 electrode exhibited a capacity retention rate of 157.7% after 400 cycles at a current density of 1 A g&#8722;1, while the Si/XC@C&#8208;0.5 electrode achieved the highest capacity after 400 cycles, reaching 835&#160;mA h g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Si materials possess a high theoretical specific capacity when used as anode material in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Si/C composites mitigate volume expansion and enhance conductivity, thus achieving improved electrochemical performance in LIBs. Herein, we report a new strategy for preparing pomegranate&#8208;like Si/C nanocomposites based on low&#8208;cost, readily available conductive carbon black (XC) by using a combination of wet chemical reduction and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques. The preparation first involves a facile wet chemical approach to controlled hydrolysis of SiCl4 within XC. Subsequently, the obtained SiO2/XC precursor is reduced to highly crystalline Si particles within XC (Si/XC) using a novel ionic liquid&#8208;magnesium reduction system, avoiding unwanted byproducts associated with conventional high&#8208;temperature magnesium reduction. Finally, a pomegranate&#8208;like Si/XC composite is coated with an outer carbon layer via CVD, forming a nano&#8208;confined Si/C structure. The composites exhibit excellent reversible capacity and good cycle stability in LIBs. At 1 A g&#8722;1 after 400 cycles, the Si/XC@C&#8208;0.5 composite delivered the highest specific capacity of 835&#160;mA h g&#8722;1, exhibiting a capacity retention rate of 121% compared to the first cycle after activation (688&#160;mA h g&#8722;1). This work provides reproducible and scalable means to prepare high&#8208;performance Si/C composites for LIBs.

         <title>Synthesis of Fully Exposed Pt Nanoparticles on a 2D Mesoporous Graphitic Nanocarbon Framework for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a novel 2D mesoporous graphitic nanocarbon framework (MGF) is synthesized through chemical etching of 2D Fe3O4 nanocube superlattices (Fe3O4 NCSLs) and subsequent high&#8208;temperature graphitization. MGF possesses large specific surface area, open porous architecture, and high graphitization degree, making it an excellent platform for constructing Pt&#8208;based ORR electrocatalysts. The resulting Pt@MGF catalyst&#160;exhibits superior ORR activity and durability over commercial Pt/C catalysts.








Abstract
The durability of proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells is often compromised by the corrosion of carbon supports in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) cathodes under harsh operating conditions, including high oxygen concentration, elevated humidity, low pH, and high potentials. To overcome this limitation, we report the synthesis of a 2D mesoporous graphitic nanocarbon framework (MGF) via chemical etching and high&#8208;temperature graphitization. The resulting MGF features a monolayer, highly ordered nanoframe architecture that offers enhanced structural stability and conductivity. Leveraging these structural advantages, we designed fully exposed Pt nanoparticles anchored on the MGF (Pt@MGF) as a model system to investigate the interplay between graphitization degree, pore architecture, and electrocatalytic performance. Among the variants, Pt@MGF&#8208;1200, synthesized at 1200&#160;&#176;C, demonstrates optimized mesopore confinement and strong Pt&#8211;carbon interactions. This results in superior electrochemical durability and ORR activity, positioning Pt@MGF&#8208;1200 as a promising alternative to conventional Pt/C catalysts.

         <title>Products of the Phenyl Radical (C6H5, X2A1) &#8211; Acetylene (C2H2, X1&#931;g+) Reaction in the 800&#8208;1,200&#160;K Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pulsed high&#8208;temperature microreactor coupled with VUV PI Re&#8208;TOF&#8208;MS was used to study the C6H5&#160;+&#160;C2H2 reaction via the HACA mechanism. Key products (C4H4, C6H5, C6H5C2H, C10H8, etc.) were detected in a molecular beam. At 800&#8211;1200&#160;K and 100&#8211;600&#160;Torr, the main products were phenylacetylene (C6H5C2H) and naphthalene (C10H8), supporting HACA dominance. Temperature and pressure trends align with theoretical predictions.








Abstract
A pulsed flow high&#8208;temperature microreactor in tandem with vacuum ultraviolet photoionization (VUV PI) reflectron time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometry (Re&#8208;TOF&#8208;MS) was employed to determine branching ratios of key product channels of the reaction of the phenyl radical (C6H5) with acetylene (C2H2) highlighting the role of the Hydrogen Abstraction &#8211; C2H2 Addition (HACA) mechanism at temperatures of 800&#8211;1,200&#160;K. Temporal profiles of m/z&#160;=&#160;26 (C2H2+), 30 (NO+), 52 (C4H4+), 77 (C6H5+), 78 (C6H6+), 102 (C6H5C2H+), 103 (C6H5C2H2+), 107 (C6H5NO+), 128 (C10H8+), and 154 (C12H10+) were recorded and characterized within a molecular beam. From the time profiles of the ion signals and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) calculations in the transient mode, zones of the molecular beam corresponding to the open valve duration time were identified. The gas velocity along the microreactor tube axis with the opened valve is strongly influenced by the backing pressure (p) in front of the nozzle and appears to be subsonic for p = 100&#160;Torr and supersonic for p &#8805; 300&#160;Torr. The main quantified finding is that phenylacetylene (C6H5C2H) constitutes the dominant product, accounting for up to 91% of consumed phenyl radicals at 1,200&#160;K, whereas naphthalene (C10H8) formation is favored at lower temperatures and higher pressures, peaking at the yield of 53% (800&#160;K, 300&#160;Torr). The observed temperature and pressure dependence of naphthalene and phenylacetylene yields are consistent with the HACA mechanism.

         <title>Tautomerism&#8208;Coupled Self&#8208;Assembly and Transformations of Iminopyrrole Metallacages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four metallacages with varying size, symmetry, and nuclearity were formed via the self&#8208;assembly of 2,5&#8208;diformylpyrrole, tren, and zinc(II) acetate. Tautomerization of the key diiminopyrrole motif to iminoaminoazafulvene altered the assemblies&#8217; properties. Stimuli&#8208;induced, partially reversible interconversions between bi&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, and dodecanuclear cages revealed their dynamic nature.








Abstract
Four discrete metallacages were obtained from the condensation of 2,5&#8208;diformylpyrrole and tren in the presence of Zn(II). The structures differed in nuclearity, size, and symmetry, with the number of templating cations playing a key role in defining the properties of the architecture. The diiminopyrrole coordination motif, a fundamental structural feature of assemblies, undergoes tautomerization in certain cases, yielding an iminoaminoazafulvene, which alters the assembly. The controlled interconversion between bi&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, and dodecanuclear cages was achieved through simple stimuli, highlighting the dynamic nature of these assemblies.

         <title>Terminal Selective Arylation of Inert Alkanes via Radical&#8208;Organometallic Crossover</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selectivity is an essential part of organic synthesis and key to synthetic efficiency. However, selectivity is challenging to achieve in hydrocarbon molecules. Herein we report a mild and direct method that combines photo&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (photo&#8208;HAT) and nickel&#8208;catalyzed organometallic chainwalking chemistry to give the first highly linear selective arylation reaction starting from inert alkanes.








Abstract
Selectivity is an essential part of organic synthesis and key to synthetic efficiency, where it can help reduce energy requirements for product separation, purification, and disposal of low value by&#8208;products. However, selectivity is challenging to achieve in hydrocarbon molecules, with C&#9472;H functionalization of alkanes almost invariably leading to a complex mixture of products favoring branched isomers and linear selectivity remaining elusive. Herein we report a mild and direct method that combines photo&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (photo&#8208;HAT) and nickel catalyzed organometallic chainwalking chemistry to give the first highly linear selective arylation reaction starting from inert alkanes. Key to success is crossover from a radical to organometallic chainwalking mechanism permitted by a monodentate lutidine ligand, allowing an unselective photo&#8208;HAT step to be funneled regioconvergently to form the linear arylation product for a variety of alkanes. This result is in sharp contrast to the unselective formation of branched products using bidentate ligands and demonstrates monodentate heterocycles to be a privileged ligand class for selective C&#9472;H functionalization. Preliminary mechanistic experiments are consistent with the radical&#8208;organometallic crossover mechanism and support it as an important step toward controllable and selective functionalization of simple hydrocarbons.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Membranes: Emerging Nanofluidic Platforms for Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent advances in HOF membranes for gas separation. In addition to covering fabrication methods of HOF membranes, this review highlights key characteristics that determine separation performance. Progress in challenging gas separations is deeply discussed, followed by an analysis of current limitations and future research directions for next&#8208;generation membrane development.








Abstract
The development of efficient and sustainable gas separation technologies is crucial for addressing global challenges in energy and the environment. Membrane separation technology, as an innovative, energy&#8208;saving, and highly efficient approach, offers an effective solution to these challenges. High&#8208;performance membranes materials serve as the core component enabling advanced and efficient membrane separation. Notably, hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) represent an emerging class of crystalline porous membrane materials formed through intermolecular hydrogen bonds between organic or metal&#8208;organic building units. The unique advantages of these materials, including moderate synthesis conditions, high crystallinity, and easy repairability and renewability, make them ideal porous membrane materials. This review comprehensively examines recent advances in HOF gas separation membranes. We objectively outline fabrication approaches and material design principle, including development prospects and preparation techniques for HOF separation membranes. We then systematically evaluate the current application status of HOF membranes in gas separation. Finally, future application potentials are projected, and challenges to be addressed in HOF gas separation are discussed.

         <title>Assembly&#8208;Sized&#8208;Controlled Chirality: Increase from Single Molecule to Micrometer Scale Enhances Chiroptical Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We envision a series of chiroptical materials based on highly emissive chiral dye DCS&#8208;Chol in multiple states of solution, powder, aggregate, gel, thin film, and liquid crystal (LC) encapsulation, the |glum| value in LC encapsulation was even amplified 491&#8208;fold, indicating a positive correlation between aggregate/assembly size and chiroptical activity.








Abstract
Achieving a high dissymmetry factor is a major challenge in the field of chiroptical activity. Notably, there is no systematic theory, from the perspective of assembly size, for achieving highly dissymmetric chiroptical materials. Here, we envision a highly emissive fluorophore DCS&#8208;Chol in multiple states, by covalently linking fluorescent dicyanodistyrylbenzene (DCS) with chiral cholesterol (Chol). DCS&#8208;Chol has a superb fluorescence quantum yield (36&#8211;74%) as a solution, powder, aggregate, gel, thin film, and liquid crystal (LC) encapsulation due to the locally excited transition. Interestingly, the successive increase in size of DCS&#8208;Chol aggregates/assemblies from single molecule to LC encapsulated state (105&#160;nm) was accompanied by amplification of circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence, indicating a positive correlation between aggregate/assembly size and chiroptical activity. In this work, a mechanism has been roundly proposed for the occurrence and amplification of chiroptical activity from the perspective of assembly size.

         <title>Recent Advances on the Electrosynthesis of H2O2 Through Two&#8208;Electron Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review comprehensively overviews the electrochemical synthesis of H2O2 via anodic water oxidation, focusing on recent advances in catalyst design, mechanism studies, device fabrication and applications. Finally, the existing challenges and future perspectives in this emerging field are discussed.








Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an eco&#8208;friendly oxidant with broad industrial applications, including wastewater treatment and paper bleaching. Despite the energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone process is the dominant method for H2O2 production, there is a growing interest in direct electrochemical synthesis as a greener production method. Electrochemical synthesis, leveraging renewable energy and abundant resources, offers a promising alternative for on&#8208;site H2O2 production. This review focuses on advancements in the two&#8208;electron water oxidation reaction (2e&#8722; WOR) for H2O2 synthesis, covering the reaction mechanisms, catalyst development, and reactor designs. In particular, this review emphasizes the importance of understanding reaction mechanisms on guiding the electrocatalyst design. At the same time, this review highlights challenges in indirect H2O2 through tuning the electrolyte ions, like the carbonate or bicarbonate electrolytes, and the need for a comprehensive understanding of the electrolyte ion mediation pathways to guide the development of accurate theoretical models for predicting catalyst performance.

         <title>Batch Synthesis of Primaquine Diphosphate Anti&#8208;Malarial Drug</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
According to the WHO, a child under the age of five dies every 2 minutes from malaria in Africa. It is therefore paramount that access and availability of anti&#8208;malarial drugs must be improved. We report a process for the synthesis of Primaquine Diphosphate, where key intermediates were obtained in a much shorter reaction time compared to processes reported in literature.








Abstract
An improved three&#8208;step synthesis route toward Primaquine Diphosphate is reported herein. The anti&#8208;malarial drug was obtained via n&#8208;alkylation of readily available potassium phthalimide, followed by reductive amination and room temperature methylaminolysis&#8208;assisted phthalimido deprotection of the key intermediates to furnish Primaquine Diphosphate in 47% overall isolated yield.

The development of high&#8208;performance electrolytes enabling rapid ionic transport represents a critical pathway for operational temperature reduction in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). This study introduces amorphous alumina (AlOx) as a novel electrolyte material, systematically investigating its structural characteristics and charge transport mechanisms through comparative analysis with crystalline alumina (&#945;&#8208;Al2O3, &#947;&#8208;Al2O3) and conventional gadolinium&#8208;doped ceria (GDC). It is found that AlOx possesses a notable enrichment of oxygen vacancy concentration. Its unique disordered atomic configuration plays a vital role in facilitating multiple pathways to enable fast ionic transport, resulting in high ionic conductivity of 0.08&#8211;0.12 S/cm at 480&#8211;540&#160;&#176;C, as evidenced by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), which is one order of magnitude superior to its crystalline counterpart. When implemented in symmetrical SOFC configurations, the AlOx electrolyte demonstrates unprecedented power density of 677&#160;mW/cm2 at 540 &#176;C. Further distribution of relaxation times (DRT) analysis confirms the predominance of protonic conduction pathways in AlOx while providing discernment of its electrochemical sub&#8208;processes. This work thus provides a new advanced electrolyte for low&#8208;temperature SOFCs while providing insights into amorphous ceramic.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free PMS Activation by Heterocycle Porous Aromatic Frameworks for Contaminant Degradation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PAF&#8208;146, a porous aromatic framework containing N and S atoms, as a metal&#8208;free catalyst for PMS&#8208;mediated environmental remediation, demonstrates excellent RhB degradation performance through both radical and nonradical pathways.








Abstract
Heteroatoms in heterocycles significantly modify the redox properties of the catalysts, thus exhibiting high efficiency, environmental friendliness, and applicability in advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) without metals. Therefore, a porous aromatic framework (PAF&#8208;146) rich in N and S atoms was synthesized from heterocycle building units and exhibited excellent stability. Benefiting from the stability and catalytic activity of PAF&#8208;146, it demonstrated a catalytic performance of degrading 99.7% of Rhodamine B (RhB) within 20&#160;minutes, with a reaction rate constant 95 times higher than that of pristine PAF without N and S atoms. Moreover, PAF&#8208;146 exhibited good resistance to interference from anions, different aquatic environments, and humic acid (HA). The strongly electronegative N and S atoms in PAF&#8208;146 initiated the redistribution of charge density, resulting in positively charged adjacent C atoms. Peroxymonosulfate (PMS) underwent a nucleophilic addition reaction on these C atoms, triggering electron transfer and ultimately leading to the formation of 1O2 and O2&#8226;&#8722;. It was revealed that PAF&#8208;146 achieved efficient degradation of RhB through a combination of radical and nonradical pathways. Our work provides guidance for the development of efficient metal&#8208;free catalysts with abundant catalytic sites for PMS&#8208;activation in environmental remediation.

         <title>Synthesis of the Soft Lewis Superacid Tris(4&#8208;bromo&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorophenyl)borane B(C6F4Br)3 via C&#8210;Ag to C&#8210;B Transmetalation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The soft Lewis acid B(C6F4Br)3 was synthesized via transmetalation from AgC6F4Br, and its Lewis acidity was assessed via DFT calculations and experimental methods, indicating an increased acidity compared to B(C6F5)3. The presence of bromine atoms is expected to facilitate structural analysis of Lewis acid&#8208;base adducts of B(C6F4Br)3 by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction in the future.








Abstract
The Lewis acid tris(4&#8208;bromo&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorophenyl)borane B(C6F4Br)3 was synthesized via transmetalation from BBr3 and AgC6F4Br. The latter was prepared from 1,4&#8208;C6F4BrSiMe3 with AgF and crystallized as a toluene solvate [2(AgC6F4Br)4&#8226;7.46(toluene)]. The solid&#8208;state structure of free B(C6F4Br)3 and its Lewis base adducts with EtCN, H2O, and POEt3 was determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. DFT calculations show that B(C6F4Br)3 has approximately 1% higher fluoride and hydride ion affinities (FIA and HIA) than tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane B(C6F5)3. Similarly, the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method indicates an increase in Lewis acidity of 2%, whereas IR spectroscopy of the CD3CN adducts reveals a slightly lower &#7805;(CN) vibration for B(C6F4Br)3. The presence of bromine atoms is expected to facilitate structural analysis of Lewis acid&#8208;base adducts of B(C6F4Br)3 by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction in the future.

         <title>Catalyst Design and Mechanistic Insights for Non&#8208;Thermal Plasma Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, we systematically explore the enhancement pathways of plasma&#8208;assisted ammonia synthesis and deeply analyze the unique mechanism of action of various catalyst design strategies, such as shielding protection, defect engineering, local electric field enhancement, and antenna/size effect, in the plasma&#8208;assisted ammonia synthesis system. Based on the latest research progress in plasma ammonia synthesis, we comprehensively evaluate the technological routes of emerging plasma ammonia synthesis systems and suggest feasible directions for future research in this field.








Abstract
Hydrogen storage technology based on ammonia carriers is a key part of the transition from fossil fuels to low&#8208;carbon energy sources. However, the high energy consumption and high carbon path dependency of the traditional ammonia industry are the core challenges constraining the development of current technologies. In this review, we focus on the core advantages of low&#8208;temperature plasma chemistry in ammonia synthesis, including mild conditions, environmental friendliness, flexibility, and controllability. We then propose a powerful approach for transitioning traditional ammonia synthesis technology in a sustainable direction. Firstly, we systematically sort out the time evolution of the plasma ammonia synthesis reactor and elucidate the mode of action of plasma&#8208;assisted ammonia synthesis. In particular, we provide an in&#8208;depth analysis of design optimization strategies for plasma catalysts to explore key catalytic mechanisms in ammonia synthesis systems. Finally, we evaluate the performance index of the existing plasma ammonia synthesis system and suggest feasible directions for future research to further improve the energy efficiency of the technology, promoting the development of the ammonia production process in a more sustainable and advanced direction.

         <title>GCI&#8208;Based Affinity Screening of Synthetic Oligomannosides toward Concanavalin A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study describes the development of a reliable GCI method for the affinity determination of neo&#8208;glycoproteins toward concanavalin A (ConA), a model lectin. The final goal is to investigate multivalent carbohydrate&#8211;lectin interactions.








Abstract
Herein, we report the first application of grating&#8208;coupled interferometry (GCI) to quantify the binding affinity of synthetically defined mannose&#8208;based neo&#8208;glycoproteins to Concanavalin A (ConA), a model lectin for carbohydrate recognition. Mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and tri&#8208;saccharides were conjugated to carrier proteins to create multivalent ligands in a structurally defined yet heterogeneous format. Unlike free sugars, which can interact with lectins in multiple orientations, conjugation constrains sugar presentation and provides a more realistic proxy of how glycans are encountered in glycoconjugates. This approach enabled a systematic comparison of sugar epitopes, confirming that Man(&#945;1,2)Man motif shows stronger binding than Man(&#945;1,6), and that the trisaccharide displays the highest affinity. Notably, the multivalent display of these relatively simple sugar motifs resulted in affinities comparable to or higher than those of natural glycoproteins, highlighting the contribution of valency and presentation rather than glycan complexity. Dissociation constants measured by GCI are consistent with literature values obtained by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and other methods, confirming the reliability of this platform. This work establishes GCI as a reliable tool for affinity profiling of glycoconjugates and highlights the value of a simple and reproducible screening strategy for evaluating structure&#8211;affinity relationships of glycans in a presentation format closer to their intended applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report the first application of grating-coupled interferometry (GCI) to quantify the binding affinity of synthetically defined mannose-based &lt;i&gt;neo&lt;/i&gt;-glycoproteins to Concanavalin A (ConA), a model lectin for carbohydrate recognition. Mono-, di-, and tri-saccharides were conjugated to carrier proteins to create multivalent ligands in a structurally defined yet heterogeneous format. Unlike free sugars, which can interact with lectins in multiple orientations, conjugation constrains sugar presentation and provides a more realistic proxy of how glycans are encountered in glycoconjugates. This approach enabled a systematic comparison of sugar epitopes, confirming that Man(&#945;1,2)Man motif shows stronger binding than Man(&#945;1,6), and that the trisaccharide displays the highest affinity. Notably, the multivalent display of these relatively simple sugar motifs resulted in affinities comparable to or higher than those of natural glycoproteins, highlighting the contribution of valency and presentation rather than glycan complexity. Dissociation constants measured by GCI are consistent with literature values obtained by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and other methods, confirming the reliability of this platform. This work establishes GCI as a reliable tool for affinity profiling of glycoconjugates and highlights the value of a simple and reproducible screening strategy for evaluating structure&#8211;affinity relationships of glycans in a presentation format closer to their intended applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Copper(II) Complexes with Schiff Bases Derived from 2&#8208;Pyridinecarbaldehyde N&#8208;Oxide and Amino Acids: Studies on DNA, BSA Binding, Nuclease Activity, and Cytotoxicity</title>

         <dc:description>
A new type of Schiff&#8208;base ligands obtained by a condensation of an N&#8208;oxide aldehyde and amino acids is introduced. Synthesis and structures of their copper(II) complexes with promising biological activities including anticancer properties are described.








Abstract
Synthesis of the first example of metal complexes containing Schiff&#8208;base ligands derived from amino acids and aldehyde with N&#8208;oxide functionality is presented. Five copper(II) complexes with the compositions [Cu(L1)(H2O)(OAc)]&#8901;H2O (1), [Cu3(L2)2Cl4(H2O)2] (2), [Cu4(L2)2Cl6(MeOH)2] (3), [Cu2(L3)Cl3(H2O)] (4), and [Cu3(L3)2Cl3(H2O)3]Cl (5) (where anionic ligands L1 &#8211; L3 are Schiff bases obtained by condensation of 2&#8208;pyridinecarbaldehyde N&#8208;oxide with 2&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid (HL1), &#946;&#8208;alanine (HL2), and 3&#8208;aminobutanoic acid (HL3)) were prepared by template synthesis and fully crystallographically characterized. Complexes 1 &#8211; 4 were examined for DNA interactions, competitive studies with EB&#8208;DNA, viscosity measurements, DNA cleavage studies, cytotoxicity studies, interactions with bovine serum albumin (BSA), and theoretical docking studies. The studied complexes bind to the helix through a nonintercalative binding mode; the interaction of complexes with ctDNA is predominantly via intercalation, while viscosity measurements indicate mostly groove binding. DNA cleavage studies revealed the highest cleavage activity for&#160;complex 1. The MTT assay on three human cell lines shows the highest cytotoxic effect for complex 1 against HepG2 (human liver cancer cell line). Experimental interaction of studied complexes with BSA indicates an intermediate binding strength between complexes and albumin, while theoretical docking studies identify possible binding sites of complexes within the BSA.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Promoted Acceptor&#8208;less Dehydrogenation of a Germane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chloride abstraction from half&#8208;sandwich ruthenium complexes leads to the generation of stable, but highly reactive, dinitrogen and triflate complexes that can activate Ge&#9472;H bonds. Reaction of the activated ruthenium complexes with GeH2Ph2leads to elimination of dihydrogen and formation of triflate&#8208;stabilized metallogermylenium complexes.








Abstract
The transition metal&#8208;mediated activation of element&#8211;hydrogen bonds is an important goal for the preparation of commodity chemical compounds and novel materials. Here a facile route to the activation of germanium&#8208;hydrogen bonds, based on the spontaneous elimination of dihydrogen, is reported. This represents a mechanistic divergence from the established methods for Ge&#9472;H bond cleavage. The novel complexes [Ru(&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)(OTf)(PPh3)2] and [{Ru(&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)(dppe)}2(&#956;&#8208;N2)]OTf2 are central to the success of this route. These crystalline species may be prepared in high yield and are highly effective sources of the 16&#8208;electron [Ru(&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)(P)2]+ fragment. Both complexes react with GeH2Ph2 to eliminate H2 and afford [Ru(&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)(GePh2OTf)(P)2] [(P)2&#160;=&#160;2 PPh3, dppe], which is best described as a triflate&#8208;stabilized metallogermylenium complex. Different species are observed on initial treatment of [Ru(&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)(OTf)(PPh3)2] or [{Ru(&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)(dppe)}2(&#956;&#8208;N2)]OTf2 with GeH2Ph2. In the dppe case, a &#963;&#8208;germane complex is identified, which is proposed to undergo spontaneous elimination of H2: a key step in the double Ge&#9472;H bond activation, promoted by the sterically demanding half&#8208;sandwich ruthenium complexes. This represents a distinct pathway for Ge&#9472;H bond activation when compared to the established routes, such as deprotonation by a basic hydrocarbyl ligand or oxidative addition, leading the way to new pathways to functionalize organogermanium compounds.

         <title>pH&#8211;Dependent Luminescence of Self&#8211;Assembly Tb3+ Complexes with Photosensitizing Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amphiphilic lanthanide complex with photosensitizer units forms stable self&#8208;assemblies in aqueous ethanol (20&#160;wt.% EtOH). The pyridyl group effectively works as both a photoantenna and a proton acceptor. Self&#8208;assemblies of the Tb3+ complex exhibit pH&#8211;dependent luminescence under weakly basic conditions, rendering it promising for biological applications.








Abstract
Luminescent metal complexes in aqueous solution have been attracting substantial interest as chemical and biological sensors. In this study, aiming to develop lanthanide complexes that exhibit bright luminescence in aqueous media, we designed and synthesized new amphiphilic ligands based on ethylenediamine with two aromatic groups and two cholesteryl groups, which act as photosensitizers and hydrophobic moieties, respectively. In particular, the Tb3+ complex of a pyridyl&#8208;substituted ligand showed an intense green emission that stems from the efficient energy transfer from the excited pyridyl groups to the Tb center in ethanol. In aqueous media, the Tb3+ complexes self&#8208;assembled into nanoparticles with diameters of around 40&#160;nm, which show pH&#8211;dependent luminescence in the pH range of 6.0&#8211;8.5 ascribable to protonation of the coordinated pyridyl groups. These findings demonstrate the potential of aggregates of photosensitized lanthanide complexes as sensors under weakly alkaline conditions.

         <title>Path Selective Photoinduced Energy and Electron Transfer in a Bis(acridinium&#8208;Zn(II) Porphyrin)&#8208;tetrapyridyl Porphyrin Host&#8208;Guest Complex</title>

Tuning unusual energy and eT processes in a bis(acridinium&#8208;Zn(II) porphyrin)&#8208;tetrapyridyl porphyrin host&#8208;guest complex.








Abstract
The 1:1 complex of a bis(acridinium&#8208;Zn(II)porphyrin) host and a tetrapyridyl free&#8208;base porphyrin guest shows a remarkable interplay of energy and electron transfer (eT) processes, finely tuned by the solvent polarity or the selection of the photoexcited component. A more polar environment (CH2Cl2) favors uncommon parallel intramolecular and intermolecular eT processes, while in an apolar solvent (toluene) the intermolecular eT process is hampered. Notably, the apolar environment also enables a rare energy transfer process from the porphyrin guest toward the charge&#8208;transfer emissive state of the tweezer host. In total, no less than four different excited states were probed, which can be sketched by an inverted pyramid diagram highlighting directional path selection.

&lt;p&gt;Tuning unusual energy and eT processes in a bis(acridinium-Zn(II) porphyrin)-tetrapyridyl porphyrin host-guest complex.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1:1 complex of a bis(acridinium-Zn(II)porphyrin) host and a tetrapyridyl free-base porphyrin guest shows a remarkable interplay of energy and electron transfer (eT) processes, finely tuned by the solvent polarity or the selection of the photoexcited component. A more polar environment (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) favors uncommon parallel intramolecular and intermolecular eT processes, while in an apolar solvent (toluene) the intermolecular eT process is hampered. Notably, the apolar environment also enables a rare energy transfer process from the porphyrin guest toward the charge-transfer emissive state of the tweezer host. In total, no less than four different excited states were probed, which can be sketched by an inverted pyramid diagram highlighting directional path selection.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Toward Organic Mimics of Metallic Nanoparticles: Tuning and Enhancing Fluorescence in Binary Dye&#8208;Based Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binary Fluorescent Organic Nanoparticles (&#1074;FONs) are made from two optically complementary polar and polarizable dyes (energy donor D and acceptor A). Core&#8208;shell &#1074;FONs exhibit Nano Interfacial Emission Enhancement (NIEE), i.e. an enhanced fluorescence quantum yield and a blueshifted emission, compared to alloy &#1074;FONs of identical composition&#8208;but devoid of core&#8208;shell topology. The NIEE effect is found to increase with the donor&#8208;to&#8208;acceptor ratio.








Abstract
A key characteristic of binary metallic nanoparticles is the extreme tuneability of their optical properties through small changes in their composition and structure. Organic mimics of such binary metallic nanoparticles with similar properties would be of major interest. Here, we present Binary Fluorescent Organic Nanoparticles (hereafter termed &#1074;FONs) made from two structurally similar but optically complementary polar and polarizable dyes (PPDs) (i.e., energy donor D and energy acceptor A) as such potential mimics. We designed dye&#8208;based core&#8208;shell and alloy &#1074;FONs with varying composition (i.e., D versus A content) and investigated their fluorescence properties. In both core&#8208;shell and alloy &#1074;FONs, the donor dyes efficiently harvest energy&#8211;through F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)&#8211;resulting in substantial brightness values (up to 1.3 108 M&#8722;1cm&#8722;1 per nanoparticle). However, &#1074;FONs' luminescence properties were found to strongly depend on their nanostructuration. Core&#8208;shell &#1074;FONs exhibit a Nano Interfacial Emission Enhancement (NIEE) effect, consisting in a blue&#8208;shifted fluorescence and enhanced FRET&#8208;mediated fluorescence quantum yield, compared to alloy &#1074;FONs of identical composition&#8211;but devoid of a core&#8208;shell topology. Moreover, we demonstrate for the first time that the extent of this NIEE effect directly depends on &#1074;FONs composition, and increases with the D/A ratio. Furthermore, bioimaging in live cells reveals that &#1074;FONs retain their binary nature and unique fluorescence properties in cellular environments.

         <dc:description>
An angelic figure holds a dinuclear dinitrosyl iron complex (DNIC) formed from {Fe(NO)2}10 and {Fe(NO)2}&#8313; mononuclear precursors. With its rare &#956;&#8208;&#951;2&#8208;FBF3 bridge and stabilization by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes, the complex symbolizes the delicate balance of redox and structural forces in coordination chemistry.








Abstract
Reaction of a {Fe(NO)3}10 trinitrosyl iron complex with a mononuclear {Fe(NO)2}10 dinitrosyl iron complex furnishes a dinuclear dinitrosyl iron complex, [(NO)2(IMes)Fe(&#956;&#8208;&#951;2&#8208;FBF3)Fe(IMes)(NO)2] (3) (IMes&#160;=&#160;1,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals an unprecedented &#956;&#8208;&#951;2&#8208;FBF3&#8722; bridge that links two [Fe(NO)2] motifs, giving an Fe&#8230;.Fe separation of 3.45&#160;&#197;. Nonclassical C&#9472;H&#8230;F contacts (3.21 &#8211; 3.61&#160;&#197;) between the mesityl methyl groups of the IMes and the nonbridging fluorine atom cradle the anion and create a pseudo&#8208;tridentate environment that stabilizes the mixed&#8208;valent core. Infrared spectroscopy exhibits four &#957;(NO) bands at 1778, 1736, 1715, and 1682 cm&#8722;1, inferring the presence of two electronically different {Fe(NO)2} units, whereas 77&#160;K EPR spectroscopy gives a rhombic signal with gavg&#160;=&#160;2.109, diagnostic of an s&#160;=&#160;1/2 species in complex 3.

         <title>Reactivity of Square Planar Pt(II) Complexes Toward Acidic Moieties as H+, M+, and [ML]+ (M&#160;=&#160;Ag, Au)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the fact that Pt(II) in square&#8208;planar complexes exhibits Lewis basic properties toward electrophilic species (E&#8314;), the presence of oxygen atoms acting as competing Lewis basic sites leads to the formation of Pt&#9472;O&#9472;E&#8314;&#9472;O&#9472;Pt or Pt&#9472;O&#9472;E&#8314; type complexes, in which no direct metal&#8211;metal bonds are observed. The formation of analogous species with either H&#8314; or [M&#8211;L]&#8314; fragments can be connected to the concept of isolobality between these electrophilic entities.








Abstract
The Lewis base (LB) properties of the d8 Pt(II) are manifested in the formation of Pt&#8594;E species, where E are electrophiles such as acidic hydrogens or metal cations. Thus, the reactions of [Pt(CNC)(dmso)] (CNC&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;di(phen&#8208;2&#8208;ide)&#8208;pyridine) toward PPh2(C6H4&#8208;o&#8208;COOH) or PPh2(C6H4&#8208;o&#8208;OH) produce complexes [Pt(CNC&#8208;H){PPh2(C6H4&#8208;o&#8208;COO)}] (1) and [Pt(CNC&#8208;H){PPh2(C6H4&#8208;o&#8208;O)}] (2). Their X&#8208;ray structures confirm the proton transfer from the OH at the phosphane to one of the phenylene rings of the CNC ligand. Then, the deprotonated oxygen occupies the vacant site. It is proposed that the transfer starts with a hydrogen bond (Pt&#8594;H) which evolves to the final products favored by the planar nature of the CNC ligand. 1 and 2 react with Ag+ and [M(PPh3)]+ (M&#160;=&#160;Ag, Au) giving rise to complexes without Pt&#9472;M bonds, but O&#9472;M or O&#9472;Ag&#9472;O instead. Their structures reveal that the oxygen atoms present in 1 and 2 advantageously compete with the Pt as the donor entity for the incoming acidic metal. Moreover, dinuclear complexes with O&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O systems structurally analogous to the O&#9472;Ag&#9472;O have been prepared and characterized. They reinforce the idea of resemblance of the proton and cations such as Ag+, Au+, [AgL]+, and [AuL]+ as Lewis acidic moieties, which is consistent with the concept of isolobality.

         <title>Ultrafine Pd Nanoparticles on Triphenylphosphine&#8208;Covalent Organic Framework for Dual Photo/Thermal Catalysis of Scalable C&#8208;C/C&#8208;N Cross&#8208;Couplings</title>

         <dc:description>
This study develops a phosphine&#8208;functionalized COF&#8208;supported ultrafine Pd nanoparticle catalyst (TyPPc&#8208;P@Pd NPs). It enables efficient thermal and photocatalytic C&#8208;C/C&#8208;N cross&#8208;couplings, including with less reactive aryl chlorides, demonstrating high activity, broad applicability, excellent stability, and recyclability for sustainable synthesis.








Abstract
The development of highly active and reusable heterogeneous catalysts for scalable organic synthesis remains a critical challenge. Here, a covalent organic framework (TyPPc&#8208;COF) with aldehyde residues was synthesized and post&#8208;modified with triphenylphosphine ligands to construct TyPPc&#8208;P&#8208;COF. Subsequently, ultrafine Pd nanoparticles (2.73&#160;nm) were uniformly anchored onto TyPPc&#8208;P&#8208;COF via phosphine&#8208;Pd coordination. The resultant TyPPc&#8208;P@Pd NPs exhibit dual&#8208;mode catalytic functionality: In C&#8208;C cross&#8208;coupling reactions involving aryl iodides, this catalyst demonstrates excellent performance under both thermal catalytic conditions (50&#160;mg catalyst, TOF&#160;=&#160;1060 h&#8722;1) and photocatalytic conditions (30&#160;mg catalyst, TOF&#160;=&#160;1780 h&#8722;1), achieving gram&#8208;scale yields (&gt;80%). Notably, under both photocatalytic and thermal catalytic conditions, this catalyst also efficiently catalyzes Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura, Heck, and Sonogashira C&#8208;C coupling reactions involving aryl bromides and aryl chlorides, which typically exhibit lower activity. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that light irradiation can effectively extend catalytic functionality to C&#8208;N bond formation. Stability tests revealed negligible Pd leaching/aggregation after multiple cycles, confirming structural robustness. This work provides a general strategy for designing COF@MNPs merging high activity, recyclability, and environmental compatibility, advancing sustainable organic synthesis.

         <title>Carbon Dots as Nano&#8208;Photocatalysts: A Green Tool for Indole and Heteroarenes Alkylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nano&#8208;photocatalytic method for the functionalization of indoles and heteroarenes is reported. The reaction is promoted by the photocatalytic activity of carbon nanodots, which was thoroughly investigated by mechanistic studies to determine the reaction mechanism. The developed procedure allowed for the preparation of alkylated heteroarenes with good yields (up to 88%), with good functional group tolerance, with the possibility to recycle the nanocatalysts up to 5 times without hindering the reaction outcomes.








Abstract
Taking into account the hurdles of climate change and environmental pollution, through the years, the development of sustainable protocols in catalysis stands as a cornerstone to answer those issues. Carbon dots (CDs) have recently proven to be efficient in various types of catalysis, including photocatalytic reactions, while being a green and economic alternative for metal catalysts. In this paper, we present a new catalytic system for the photoredox functionalization of indoles and heteroarenes derivatives based on CDs as nano&#8208;photocatalysts. This reaction, based on the cooperation between our catalyst and 2,6&#8208;lutidine, shows the ability to functionalize these compounds up to 88%, it is effective on 1&#160;mmol scale, and shows a recyclability potential at least to 5 cycles. This system also demonstrated the capacity of obtaining rare types on indoles, having two electron withdrawing groups (EWG), both on the carbon 2 (C2) and carbon 3 (C3). Furthermore, careful studies led to the partial resolution of the mechanism, and to explanations on the regioselectivity of the reaction, which has been studied through the nature of both reagents and substrates, but also through the light's wavelength used in the reaction.

         <title>Oxidant&#8208;Triggered Bioconjugation Chemistry: Expanding the Landscape of Ligandable Lysine Residues in the Proteome</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
The development of covalent drugs targeting lysine residues represents a transformative frontier in chemical biology and drug discovery. Despite the abundance of lysine (5.6% of proteomic residues) and its functional versatility, exploration has been hindered by the lack of robust methods to profile its reactivity and ligandability. This work introduces a new oxidant&#8208;triggered bioconjugation platform that enables global mapping of lysine residues, and reveals over 7,000 covalently modifiable sites. By leveraging hydroxamic acid probes activated by soluble and low&#8208;toxicity sodium periodate (NaIO4), this strategy overcomes the limitations of traditional electrophiles and provides insights into the role of lysines in protein function and disease. The platform can be applied to kinase profiling, cancer target discovery, and covalent inhibitor development, offering a potential strategy for addressing &#8220;undruggable&#8221; proteins.

         <title>Experimental and Computational Investigation of Surface&#8208;Responsive Riboflavin&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Assembled Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled crystal of riboflavin exhibits responsive modes of surface&#8208;directed molecular assembly, accompanied by measurable electromechanical properties. This behavior highlights how subtle variations in molecular packing and supramolecular interactions at the crystal interface can directly influence macroscopic functional responses. By bridging the molecular organization with emergent physical properties, these findings elucidate key structure&#8211;function relationships, offering new perspectives for the design of bioinspired materials with tunable electromechanical properties.








Abstract
Metabolites, including amino acids, nucleobases, and vitamins, have emerged as promising candidates for sustainable functional materials due to their inherent biocompatibility and low fabrication costs. Notable examples include glycine&#8208;based nanogenerators, indigo&#8208;based organic transistors, and caffeine&#8208;based optical waveguides. Riboflavin (vitamin B2), forms optically active supramolecular structures in the tapetum lucidum of lemurs and cats; however, its detailed packing and functional role remain unknown. Here, aiming to explore the bio&#8208;inspired self&#8208;assembly of riboflavin to uncover potential device applications, we discovered and extensively characterized a new single co&#8208;crystal using a combination of crystallography, microscopy, and mechanical experiments supported by atomistic molecular models to understand the organization on different surfaces. The crystals exhibit pronounced surface responsiveness, leading to the formation of distinct branched, twisted, and serrated micron&#8208;scale morphologies as the riboflavin self&#8208;assembled on different substrates of copper, mica, and silicon. This intrinsic ability to adapt shape and generate substrate&#8208;templated structures was confirmed computationally and experimentally and was attributed mainly to the crystal's relatively low Young's modulus, reflecting its lattice flexibility. This structure&#8211;function study of an adaptable metabolite crystal offers fundamental insights into how molecular organization governs mechanical responsiveness, advancing the understanding of bio&#8208;inspired crystallization and paving the way for future technological applications.

         <title>Ag5Pd2O4, a New Subvalent Silver Oxide, Obtained from Ag2PdO2 via a High&#8208;pressure Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag5Pd2O4 has been obtained from the reaction of Ag2PdO2 at a hydrostatic pressure of &#8764;30&#160;GPa and laser heating at 1500&#160;K in a diamond anvil cell (DAC). The new oxide exhibits very short Ag&#8208;Ag distances and is subvalent with respect to silver. Quantum chemical calculations describe the new compound as metallic conducting.








Abstract
Subvalent silver oxides, where silver exhibits an oxidation state between 0 and&#160;+&#160;1, have traditionally been discovered serendipitously due to a lack of systematic synthesis methods and understanding of their bonding schemes. This study presents a novel, purposeful approach to synthesizing multinary subvalent silver oxides through high&#8208;pressure techniques. By subjecting the monovalent silver oxide Ag2PdO2 to hydrostatic pressure of &#8764;30&#160;GPa and laser heating at 1500&#160;K, subvalent Ag5Pd2O4 forms besides PdO. The crystal structure of Ag5Pd2O4, determined via in situ single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, reveals distinct layers of cationic silver aggregates and anionic oxopalladate units. Electronic structure calculations confirm the subvalent nature of silver in Ag5Pd2O4, showing a vanished band gap and increased electron density on silver atoms. The findings pave the way for developing materials with rich magneto&#8208;electronic functionalities, owing to the interplay between subvalent silver and transition metal cations.

The findings pave the way for developing materials with rich magneto-electronic functionalities, owing to the interplay between subvalent silver and transition metal cations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design, Synthesis, and Biological Evaluation of Lipid&#8208;Modified Derivatives of Tunicamycins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tunicamycins inhibit the bacterial enzyme MraY, which is involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis, but they also inhibit human GPT, leading to cytotoxicity. This study investigated the structure&#8208;activity relationship of the fatty acyl chain of tunicamycin to develop MraY&#8208;selective inhibitors, based on structural differences between MraY and GPT. As a result, an analogue was identified that exhibited antibacterial activity without cytotoxicity.








Abstract
Naturally occurring antibiotic tunicamycin targets bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis by inhibiting bacterial phospho&#8208;N&#8208;acetylmuraminic acid (MurNAc)&#8208;pentapeptide translocase (MraY), but it also inhibits human UDP&#8208;N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc): polyprenol phosphate translocase (GPT), leading to cytotoxicity. This study thoroughly investigated the structure&#8208;activity relationship of the fatty acyl side chain of tunicamycin to develop MraY&#8208;selective inhibitors, based on structural differences between MraY and GPT. Longer alkyl chains and flexible structures were found to favor MraY inhibitory activity, and benzene rings were acceptable for binding. The hybrid analogue containing oleoyl group, which contributed most significantly to MraY inhibitory activity, and the MurNAc moiety, which is important for MraY&#8208;selective inhibition, showed enhanced MraY inhibitory activity as well as improved antibacterial activity against S. aureus and E. faecium.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed P&#8208;Arylation of HP(= O)(R/OR)2 Nucleophiles with (Hetero)Aryl Chlorides Enabled by DalPhos Ligation</title>

         <dc:description>
The development of broadly useful C&#8208;P cross&#8208;couplings of (hetero)aryl chlorides and HP(O)(R/OR)2 nucleophiles by use of nickel/DalPhos&#8208;based catalysts is described, along with findings from DFT studies that confirm the preference for C&#8208;P bond formation in this system arising from three&#8208;cantered reductive elimination through substrate PV pathways.








Abstract
Herein we disclose our development of broadly useful C&#8208;P cross&#8208;couplings of (hetero)aryl chlorides and HP(O)(R)2 or HP(O)(OR)2 nucleophiles, enabled by use of nickel/DalPhos&#8208;based catalysts. These typically use 5 mol% nickel at 110 &#176;C for 18&#160;hours, but the feasibility of shorter or milder reactions was demonstrated with one specific example. The ability to apply such transformations on gram scale, and in the P&#8208;arylation of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) (i.e., chloroquine and clozapine) was also shown. Also described are our findings arising from the computational modelling of such cross&#8208;coupling reactions by use of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which confirmed the clear preference for C&#8208;P bond formation involving three&#8208;centered reductive elimination through substrate PV pathways.

         <title>Injectable Hyaluronic Acid Hydrogel Integrated with Hybrid Nanovesicles for Synergistic Enhancement of Transdermal Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile Hybrid&#8208;Gel platform combining CoQ10&#8208;loaded hybrid nanovesicles with an injectable, pH&#8208;responsive hydrogel network significantly enhances transdermal drug delivery efficiency, offering a robust strategy for localized therapy.








Abstract
Plant&#8208;derived nanovesicles offer promising potential for transdermal drug delivery due to their inherent biocompatibility and low immunogenicity, yet face limitations in drug loading, structural stability, and functional optimization. This study presents a versatile Hybrid&#8208;Gel platform that integrates CoQ10&#8208;loaded hybrid vesicles with an injectable, pH&#8208;responsive hydrogel to enhance localized drug delivery. High&#8208;purity nanovesicles are isolated using an optimized ultracentrifugation (UC) and size&#8208;exclusion chromatography (SEC) method, then hybridized with liposomes to improve encapsulation and skin penetration. To further optimize localized delivery performance, an injectable binary hydrogel system is then introduced. This hydrogel, formed via Schiff base crosslinking between hyperbranched polyethylene glycol and aldehyde&#8208;modified hyaluronic acid (A&#8208;HA), exhibits mild gelation conditions, excellent injectability, and strong tissue adhesion. The hydrogel effectively encapsulates hybrid nanovesicles, ensuring enhanced stability, ease of administration, and controlled, pH&#8208;responsive release. As a proof of concept, an in vitro permeation test with porcine skin model demonstrates that the hydrogel significantly improves CoQ10 penetration, achieving a more than fourfold increase in transdermal efficiency compared to free CoQ10, suggesting superior bioavailability. This synergistic approach, combining hybrid nanovesicle&#8208;mediated drug transport with a dynamic hydrogel matrix, offers a robust and versatile platform for localized transdermal therapy, with potential applications in precision medicine, regenerative treatments, and chronic disease management.

         <title>Directing Effects of Silyl and Germyl Groups in Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Allylic Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the maturity of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed allylic substitution, unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;disubstituted electrophiles remain underexplored due to inherent regioselectivity challenges. This Concept highlights the strategic use of silyl and germyl groups to overcome this limitation, steering bond formation with high regiocontrol and serving as linchpins for further molecular diversification.








Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed allylic substitution is a well&#8208;established strategy for the formation of carbon&#8211;carbon and carbon&#8211;heteroatom bonds. However, most methods remain incompatible with unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;disubstituted allylic electrophiles as regioselectivity becomes difficult to control when the substituents are electronically and sterically similar. Achieving simultaneous control over the enantio&#8208; and regioselectivity as well as the alkene geometry poses an even greater challenge. To address this, sterically and electronically influential main&#8208;group elements such as carbon's heavier homologues silicon and germanium have been strategically incorporated. These metalloids can steer the bond formation away from their proximity enabling the formation of a single regioisomer while also serving as versatile linchpins for further functionalization. This Concept summarizes the key advancements made in the field since the discovery of the allylic substitution with a particular focus on silyl&#8208; and germyl&#8208;directed strategies that have expanded the synthetic utility of this highly valuable transformation.

         <title>Molecule&#8208;Induced Radical Formation (MIRF) Reaction of Et2BOOEt with Et3B is Key to the Et3B/O2 Radical Initiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Open to air Et3B is a common radical initiator. Contrary to previous suggestions, most initiating Et&#8226; radicals in this system are formed in a molecule&#8208;induced radical formation (MIRF) reaction of Et2BOOEt with Et3B, and not in Et3B autoxidation. This reaction of Et2BOOEt with Et3B could be used as a radical initiator in its own right, providing higher radical flux than Et3B/O2, as demonstrated in several model reactions.








Abstract
Open&#8208;to&#8208;air triethylborane (Et3B) is a well&#8208;known room&#8208;temperature initiator of free radical reactions. Current consensus is that the initiating species in this system are ethyl radicals formed in the triethylborane autoxidation cycle, although some early studies suggested that reactions of the oxidation products can also contribute to the initiation. We report a quantitative mechanistic study which demonstrates that most ethyl radicals in the triethylborane initiator system are not formed in the autoxidation cycle but instead are generated by a Molecule&#8208;Induced Radical Formation (MIRF) reaction between triethylborane and its main oxidation product, ethylperoxyborane Et2BOOEt (secondary initiation). A simplified kinetic model allowed us to predict optimal conditions for the initiation, and propose the MIRF reaction as an alternative, homogeneous initiator system. The high efficiency of this initiator has been demonstrated in several model radical reactions.

&lt;p&gt;Open-to-air triethylborane (Et&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;B) is a well-known room-temperature initiator of free radical reactions. Current consensus is that the initiating species in this system are ethyl radicals formed in the triethylborane autoxidation cycle, although some early studies suggested that reactions of the oxidation products can also contribute to the initiation. We report a quantitative mechanistic study which demonstrates that most ethyl radicals in the triethylborane initiator system are not formed in the autoxidation cycle but instead are generated by a Molecule-Induced Radical Formation (MIRF) reaction between triethylborane and its main oxidation product, ethylperoxyborane Et&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BOOEt (secondary initiation). A simplified kinetic model allowed us to predict optimal conditions for the initiation, and propose the MIRF reaction as an alternative, homogeneous initiator system. The high efficiency of this initiator has been demonstrated in several model radical reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spatially Resolved 2D Laser Writing on Graphene Using Diazonium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive investigation of laser&#8208;induced covalent patterning, defunctionalization, and refunctionalization of single&#8208;layer graphene with aryl diazonium salts is reported. Scanning Raman microscopy verifies spatial control, while systematic variation of laser parameters and substituent effects highlights the versatility of the method. The demonstrated &#8220;write&#8208;erase&#8208;rewrite&#8221; capability establishes a robust platform for micrometer&#8208;scale fabrication of complex, functionalized graphene architectures.








Abstract
We present the first investigation of precise laser&#8208;guided patterning, functionalization, defunctionalization, and refunctionalization of single&#8208;layer graphene (SLG) with three different aryl diazonium salts. Using scanning Raman microscopy (SRM) we confirmed the spatially resolved nature of the functionalization. We systematically investigated the influence of key laser parameters (power, irradiation time, and wavelength) and the electronic effects of the substituents on both the functionalization efficiency and integrity of graphene. Our solid&#8208;phase approach unequivocally demonstrates that laser&#8208;triggered covalent attachment can achieve high functionalization levels comparable to solution&#8208;based methods. We also unveil a novel laser&#8208;induced defunctionalization pathway at high laser powers and prolonged irradiation times, which allows for the precise, patterned functional group &#8220;erasure&#8221; &#8211; a significant advantage over nonselective thermal annealing. Furthermore, we successfully demonstrate the successful readdressing and refunctionalization of these laser &#8220;erased&#8221; areas, enabling a complete &#8220;write&#8208;erase&#8208;rewrite&#8221; cycle. This work establishes a robust and highly adaptable platform for creating complex, mixed&#8208;functionalized graphene architectures with micrometer precision.

         <title>Photoswitchable Pseudorotaxanes with Dual Chromism and Tunable Fluorescence for Multilevel Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two photoswitchable pseudorotaxanes were constructed through supramolecular host&#8208;guest interactions, exhibiting distinct photochromic, vapochromic, and fluorescent properties in the solid state, which enables their application in multilevel information encryption systems.








Abstract
The design and construction of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) displaying distinct physical/chemical properties under different states is highly desirable due to their multifunctional applications. Herein, we report a photoswitchable pseudorotaxane system constructed through host&#160;&#8722;&#160;guest interactions between a vinyl&#8208;bipyridinium axle and cucurbit[7]uril (Q[7]) macrocycle. Upon light irradiation, the [3]pseudorotaxane E&#8208;G2+@Q[7]2 in aqueous solution undergoes E&#8594;Z photoisomerization, converting to the [2]pseudorotaxane Z&#8208;G2+@Q[7], where Q[7] selectively encircles the central Z&#8208;vinyl&#8208;bipyridinium unit. Notably, E&#8208;G2+@Q[7]2 displays dual photochromic and vapochromic (NH3) activity, whereas Z&#8208;G2+@Q[7] is optically and vapor&#8208;responsively inert. Additionally, both E&#8208;G2+@Q[7]2 and Z&#8208;G2+@Q[7] exhibit distinct solid&#8208;state fluorescence emissions due to macrocyclic confinement effects. By leveraging these stimuli&#8208;responsive properties, we developed a multilevel information encryption system with three decryption states controlled by wavelength&#8208;specific irradiation (365&#160;nm, 430&#160;nm, or xenon lamp), enabling programmable message display via fluorescence and color changes. This work provides a paradigm for designing smart materials with integrated photoswitching, chromic, and fluorescent functionalities for advanced security applications.

         <title>Green Carbon Fiber Modification for Structural Battery: the Effect of Treatment Parameters on Structural Battery Body Strength</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops an eco&#8208;friendly method to enhance the mechanical properties of carbon fiber reinforced composites for structural batteries. Hydrogen peroxide&#8208;based oxidation is optimized by varying concentration, temperature, and time, achieving effective interfacial adhesion without damaging fibers. FTIR, XPS, and SEM confirm functionalization and uniform surface roughness, while tensile tests show &#8764;80% strength improvement under 30 wt% H2O2 at 60 &#176;C for 45 min. The approach reduces environmental impact and supports multifunctional, lightweight composites for electric vehicle and aerospace applications.








Abstract
Batteries and environmental processes are essential for the progress of contemporary technology from two distinct considering a sustainable future. Environmental processes aim for minimizing material and energy usage while regulating systems do not release dangerous gasses. The presented work demonstrates the modification of carbon fiber (CF) to enhance the strength of the outer case of structural batteries, a novel form of battery. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), an eco&#8208;friendly compound, has been utilized for this purpose. The strength of the carbon fiber enhances with the formation of the interface. The experimental results indicate that carbon fibers treated in a 30&#160;wt.% H2O2 solution at 60 &#176;C for 45 minutes exhibited an 80% enhancement in strength than pristine CF and a 35% improvement relative to the desized CF.

         <title>Synthesis of a Functionalized Bicyclo[3.2.1]Octane: A Common Subunit to Kauranes, Grayananes, and Gibberellanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed account on the synthesis of a bicyclo[3.2.1]octane scaffold, common to the kaurane, grayanane, and gibberellane diterpenoid families, is reported. Our original strategy relying on a 1,4&#8208;sila&#8208;Prins cyclization proved unsuccessful. Learning from that, we designed an alternative strategy relying on ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM), which ultimately led to the desired compound in 8 steps.








Abstract
Kauranes, grayananes, and gibberellanes are three important diterpenoid families. These natural products all share a bicyclo[3.2.1]octane skeleton, with oxidation at very specific positions. In this manuscript, we describe the synthesis of a bicyclo[3.2.1]octane building block, which could serve as a potential intermediate for the synthesis of natural products from these three families. A first approach relying on a 1,4&#8208;sila&#8208;Prins cyclization was first explored, which required the selective functionalization of dihydrocarvone (via C&#9472;H activation and selective oxidation). This strategy resulted in a dead end when a 1,2&#8208;cyclization product was obtained. An alternative strategy relying on ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM) allowed to successfully achieve the synthesis of the desired scaffold in 8 steps from cyclohexenone.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Doped Copper Oxide Nanorods for Efficient Biomass Electro&#8208;Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we have demonstrated that Ni doping improved the activity of HMFOR by optimizing the electronic structure of Cu sites and enhancing the adsorption of HMF. The Ni&#8208;CuOx exhibits a large current density of 199.7 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.4 V, which is 2.8&#8208;fold higher than that of pure CuOx. Moreover, it achieves a high FDCA yield of 90.1% and a Faraday efficiency of 98.5%.








Abstract
Cu&#8208;based catalysts are regarded as promising materials for the electro&#8208;oxidation of biomass. However, developing effective strategies to improve the intrinsic activity of Cu&#8208;based catalysts is still challenging and rarely reported. Herein, we synthesized a nickel&#8208;doped copper oxide catalyst (Ni&#8208;CuOx) for 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) electro&#8208;oxidation to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). The Ni&#8208;CuOx exhibited a large current density of 199.7&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.4&#160;V, which is 2.8&#8208;fold higher than that of pure CuOx, and exceeds most of the reported Cu&#8208;based catalysts. Moreover, the Ni&#8208;CuOx also showed high FDCA yield (90.1%) and Faradaic efficiency (98.5%). Physical characterizations and electrochemical analyses demonstrated that Ni doping optimizes the electronic structure of Cu sites, and promoting the adsorption of HMF, contributing to enhanced electrocatalytic activity. This work provides insights into the rational design of copper&#8208;based catalysts for biomass electro&#8208;oxidation.

&lt;p&gt;In this work, we have demonstrated that Ni doping improved the activity of HMFOR by optimizing the electronic structure of Cu sites and enhancing the adsorption of HMF. The Ni-CuOx exhibits a large current density of 199.7 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.4 V, which is 2.8-fold higher than that of pure CuO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;. Moreover, it achieves a high FDCA yield of 90.1% and a Faraday efficiency of 98.5%.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cu-based catalysts are regarded as promising materials for the electro-oxidation of biomass. However, developing effective strategies to improve the intrinsic activity of Cu-based catalysts is still challenging and rarely reported. Herein, we synthesized a nickel-doped copper oxide catalyst (Ni-CuO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) for 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) electro-oxidation to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). The Ni-CuO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; exhibited a large current density of 199.7&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.4&#160;V, which is 2.8-fold higher than that of pure CuO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, and exceeds most of the reported Cu-based catalysts. Moreover, the Ni-CuO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; also showed high FDCA yield (90.1%) and Faradaic efficiency (98.5%). Physical characterizations and electrochemical analyses demonstrated that Ni doping optimizes the electronic structure of Cu sites, and promoting the adsorption of HMF, contributing to enhanced electrocatalytic activity. This work provides insights into the rational design of copper-based catalysts for biomass electro-oxidation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Developing High&#8208;Rate Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries with Zn&#8208;Doped V10O24&#183;12H2O Cathode</title>

Zinc doping into V10O24&#183;12H2O enhances its electronic conductivity and expands the interlayer spacing, thereby enabling superior rate capability and prolonged durability as a cathode for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) have garnered attention as a cost&#8208;effective and safer alternative to lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, developing suitable cathode materials which can reversibly host Zn2&#160;+&#160;ions remains a challenge. Herein we explore the effect of zinc doping into hydrothermally synthesized V10O24.12H2O (ZVO) and demonstrate that such doping enhances electronic conductivity and structural stability, leading to improved rate capability and cycling performance of ZVO as a cathode material for AZIBs. The effect of zinc doping in the V10O24.12H2O as a ZIB cathode has not been previously explored. The ZVO materials had a bundled rod&#8208;like morphology with a zinc content of 1.3% and an average oxidation state of 4.86 for the vanadium. DFT calculations further validate that Zn doping to the pristine V10O24&#160;is thermodynamically favorable, which also improves the electronic conductivity of the ZVO. As a result, the Zn//ZVO cell exhibited superior specific capacity and improved rate performance over the pristine V10O24.12H2O (VO) electrode, with a high specific capacity of 359 mAh/g at 0.1 A/g and sustained 121 mAh/g at 5 A/g. The Zn//ZVO cell also showed commendable cycle stability with 90 mAh/g capacity retention over 1110 cycles, which was equivalent to the starting capacity of the pristine VO cathode.

         <title>Cage Amine Superbases: Synthesis and Studies of Nona(ethylene)Hexamine and Dodeka(ethylene)Octamine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strongest known cage&#8208;amine bases, nona(ethylene)hexamine and dodeka(ethylene)octamine have been prepared and characterized using experimental and theoretical methods.








Abstract
The cage&#8208;amine molecules nona(ethylene)hexamine and dodeka(ethylene)octamine, have been prepared by coupling 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane (tacn) or 1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane (cyclen) to the corresponding &#945;&#8208;chloroacetamide derivatives of these macrocycles. The formed tri&#8208; or tetra&#8208;amide cryptands were then reduced to the corresponding hexamine and octamine with borane. In all cases, the amide and amine cryptands were isolated as protonated ammonium salts, with the proton oriented to the inside of the cage molecules (i.e., endohedral). Deprotonation studies on the hexamine and octamine showed the encapsulated protons are highly inert, with no evidence of deprotonation or deuterium exchange. Detailed theoretical studies predict very high proton affinity and basicity of 1118.7 and 1086.7&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1, respectively, for dodeka(ethylene)octamine, and 1108.3 and 1083.7&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1, respectively, for nona(ethylene)hexamine, placing them among the strongest amine bases ever prepared and firmly within the realm of &#8220;superbases&#8221;.
