         <title>Intrinsic regularity of catalytic cobalt chalcogenides in lithium&#8208;sulfur battery: Theoretical study delivers new insights</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cobalt chalcogenides CoX2  (X=S, Se, Te) render great performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries based on catalytic capacity to alleviate shuttle effect. Given that S/Se/Te belong to the same main group, the outstanding cycling stability delivered by CoTe2  aroused the curiosity about the uniqueness of CoTe2  and intrinsic laws of cobalt chalcogenide. Herein, comprehensive theoretical study delivers new insights into the intrinsic laws of CoX2  : the relative vertical distance of two X atomic layers (rather than atom electronegativity) mainly controls adsorption; CoX2  mainly regulates the charging process (rather than discharging process) thus contributes to great cycling stability. On this basis, the advantages of CoTe2  are three&#8208;fold: moderate polysulfide adsorption, facile ion transport capacity, and surprisingly great promotion of charging process. It is hope the results will facilitate the development of cobalt chalcogenides, especially tellurides as cataytic material in lithium sulfur batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of the Coordinated Transition Metal Ion on Magnetic Relaxation of Lanthanide Based Complexes with Imino Nitroxide Biradical Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In spite of achievement of a lot of Ln&#8208;radical SMMs, how to improve magnetic behavior&#160;of Ln&#8208;radical system&#160;remains challenging. Here, two series of Ln&#8208;radical complexes have successfully been built using an imino nitroxide biradical, namely, [Ln  2  (hfac)  6  (ImPhPyobis)  2  ] (Ln  III  = Gd  1  , Tb  2  , Dy  &#160;  3  ) and [Ln  2  Cu  2  (hfac)  10  (ImPhPyobis)  2  ] (Ln  III  = Gd  4  , Dy  &#160;  5  ; hfac = hexafluoroacetylacetonate and ImPhPyobis = 5&#8208;(4&#8208;oxypyridinium&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,3&#8208; bis(1'&#8208;oxyl&#8208;4',4',5',5'&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;hydro&#8208;1  H  &#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzene). For these biradical&#8208;metal complexes, two imino nitroxide biradicals bind two Ln(III) ions via their oxygen atoms coming from 4&#8208;oxypyridinium units to produce a binuclear {Ln  2  O  2  } unit. Those imino nitroxide groups are free for complexes  1  &#8208;  3  , however one of imino nitroxide groups of the biradical is ligated to the copper(II) ion for complexes  4  and  5  . The distinct magnetic relaxation behaviors are observed for two Dy derivatives, as revealed by ac magnetic studies: complex  3  presents one magnetic process with the effective energy barrier(  U  eff  ) of 74.0K while complex  5  exhibits dual relaxation processes with  U  eff  values for the fast&#8208; and slow&#8208;relaxation being 20.2K and 30.9K, respectively, which implies that the second coordination sphere of Dy ion plays a critical role for magnetic relaxation.</dc:description>

         <title>E&#8208;selective Semi&#8208;hydrogenation of Alkynes Under Mild Conditions by a Diruthenium Hydride Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reacting the t Bu PNNP expanded pincer ligand with two equiv of RuHCl(PPh 3 ) 3 (CO) at 140 &#176;C produces an insoluble air&#8208;stable complex, which was structurally characterized as [Ru 2 ( t Bu PNNP)H(&#956;&#8208;H)Cl(&#956;&#8208;Cl)(CO) 2 ] ( 1 ) using solid&#8208;state NMR, IR and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopies and follow&#8208;up reactivity. A reaction with KO t Bu results in deprotonation of a methylene linker to produce [Ru 2 ( t Bu PNNP*)H(&#956;&#8208;H)(&#956;&#8208;O t Bu)(CO) 2 ] ( 3 ) featuring a partially dearomatized naphthyridine core. This enables metal&#8208;ligand cooperative activation of H 2 analogous to the mononuclear analogue, [Ru( t Bu PNP*)H(CO)]. In contrast to the mononuclear system, the bimetallic analogue 3 allows for the E &#8208;selective semi&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynes at ambient temperature and atmospheric H 2 pressure with good functional group tolerance. Monitoring the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of diphenylacetylene by 1 H NMR spectroscopy shows the intermediacy of Z &#8208;stilbene, which is subsequently isomerized to the E &#8208;isomer. Initial findings into the mode of action of this system are provided, including the spectroscopic characterization of a polyhydride intermediate and the isolation of a deactivated species with a partially hydrogenated naphthyridine backbone.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;based Aerogels catalysts for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dioxide, the most widely distributed carbon source in nature, has been widely investigated for its reduction and reuse. In this field, nanometallic materials have been widely studied because of their excellent photo/electrocatalytic activity. As one of the nanometallic materials, metal aerogel has the unique advantages of high electron transfer rate and large specific surface area, as well as rich pore space and strong adsorption performance, which makes it a highly researched material for catalytic CO  2  reduction in recent years. In this paper, we firstly report the latest preparation methods of metal aerogels and the recent progress in electrocatalytic CO  2  reduction. After that, the properties of several typical metallic aerogels and their latest applications in electrocatalytic CO  2  reduction are described. Finally, the vision and research directions for the future industrialization of metal aerogels for electrocatalytic CO  2  reduction are proposed from the perspective of practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrical Conductive/Insulating Bi&#8208;functional Layers for Stable Zn Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc&#8208;ion batteries are regarded as an extremely promising candidate for large&#8208;scale energy storage equipment due to the inexpensive ingredients&#160;and high safety. However, the dendrite growth and side reactions occur in Zn anode, which lead to the exceedingly low coulombic efficiency (CE) and the poor cycling&#8208;stability. In this work, we propose a strategy of conductive/insulating bi&#8208;functional coating layer (CIBL) for stable Zn metal anode.  The porous Ag nanowires (NWs) coating as conductive layer effectively reduces nuclear barrier and contains Zn  2+  deposition in a certain space.  Polyimide  (PI) coatings using as insulating layer implement a shunting effect on Zn  2+  , which could reduce the differential&#8208;concentration on the Zn surface and induce the uniform deposition of Zn  2+  . Therefore, the CIBL&#8208;Zn//CIBL&#8208;Zn battery achieves stable plating/stripping of over 1300 hours at 1  mA cm  &#8208;2  . The CE of CIBL&#8208;Zn//CIBL&#8208;Zn battery maintains at 99.2% even after 1000 cycles. Moreover, the CIBL&#8208;Zn//V  2  O  5  battery exhibits a capacity of nearly 289.2 mA h g  &#8208;1  at 5 A g  &#8208;1  after 3000 cycles and no sign of capacity degradation is found, which further demonstrate the feasibility of this strategy in practical application.</dc:description>

         <title>Decatungstate&#8208;Photocatalyzed Dearomative Hydroacylation of Indoles: Direct Synthesis of 2&#8208;Acylindolines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;A POM out of the blue&#8221;. Decatungstate anion photocatalyzed a mild dearomatization of indoles to access 2&#8208;acylindolines via direct hydrogen atom transfer under purple&#8208;light irradiation.







Abstract
We report herein a convenient and scalable dearomative hydroacylation reaction of indoles. Employing readily available aldehydes as the acyl source and TBADT as an inexpensive direct HAT photocatalyst, a variety of indoles derivatives were converted into synthetically interesting 2&#8208;acylindolines in good to excellent yields as well as great diastereoselectivity under mild conditions. An asymmetric version of the reaction was successfully developed and an experimental mechanistic investigation was carried out in order to gain further insights on the assumed reaction pathway.

         <title>Branched Tertiary Amines from Aldehydes and &#945;&#8208;Olefins by Combined Multiphase Tandem Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transformation of olefins to branched amines is presented by combining a hydroformylation/aldol condensation tandem reaction with the reductive amination in a combined multiphase system that each can be recycled 9 times. The product phase of the first system is the substrate phase for the second recycling. The yields are stable during those recycling runs and the leaching is low with 0.09&#8201;% over the two recycling stages.







Abstract
This study presents the transformation of olefins to branched amines by combining a hydroformylation/aldol condensation tandem reaction with the reductive amination in a combined multiphase system that can be recycled 9 times. The products are branched amines that are precursors for surfactants. Since the multiphase hydrofomylation/aldol condensation system has already been studied, the first step was to develop the partial hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes together with a subsequent reductive amination. The rhodium/phosphine catalyst is immobilized in a polar polyethylene phase which separates from the product phase after the reaction. Reaction and catalyst recycling are demonstrated by the conversion of the C14&#8208;aldehyde 2&#8208;pentylnonenal with the dimethylamine surrogate dimethylammonium dimethylcarbamate to the corresponding tertiary amine with yields up to 88&#8201;% and an average rhodium leaching of less than 0.1&#8201;% per recycling run. Furthermore, the positive influence of a Bronsted acid and carbon monoxide on the selectivity are discussed. Finally, the two PEG based systems have been merged in one recycling approach, by using the product phase of the hydroformylation aldol condensation reaction for the reductive amination reaction. The yields are stable during a nine recycling runs and the leaching low with 0.09&#8201;% over the two recycling stages.

         <title>Controlling the Emissive, Chiroptical, and Electrochemical Properties of Double [7] Helicenes through Embedded Aromatic Rings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling the photophysics of double helicenes is facilely achieved by variation of the terminal aromatic rings. Compared to the thiadiazole&#8208;fused and all&#8208;carbon analogs, triazole&#8208;fused double helicene shows significantly enhanced emission with near&#8208;unity quantum yield, and high circularly polarized luminescence brightness of up to 30.1&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1, as well as excellent ambipolar redox behavior.







Abstract
We present here the synthesis and in&#8208;depth physicochemical characterization of a double hetero[7]helicene fused with four triazole rings at both helical ends. The comparison of this triazole&#8208;fused double helicene with the previously reported all&#8208;carbon and thiadiazole&#8208;fused analogs revealed the huge impact of the embedded aromatic rings on the photophysical features. The small structural variation of the terminal rings from thiadiazole to triazole caused a dramatic change of the photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) from &lt;1&#8201;% to 96&#8201;%, while the replacement of the terminal benzene rings with triazole rings induced a tenfold enhancement of the circularly polarized luminescence dissymmetry factor. These observations were well corroborated with transient absorption analysis and/or theoretic calculations. In addition, the triazole&#8208;fused double helicene exhibited ambipolar redox behavior, enabling the generation of radical cation and anion species by electrochemical and chemical methods and showing its potential for spin&#8208;related applications.

         <title>Monomeric Magnesium Catalyzed Alkene and Alkyne Hydroboration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A monomeric magnesium methyl complex has been employed for alkene and alkyne hydroboration. The methodology has been extended towards terpenes. A detailed theoretical calculation has been provided to understand the mechanism.







Abstract
In this work, two monomeric magnesium alkyl complexes (1 and 2) were prepared using bis(phosphino)carbazole framework and among them 1 has been used as a catalyst for hydroboration of alkenes and alkynes with pinacolborane (HBpin). A broad variety of aromatic and aliphatic alkenes and alkynes were efficiently reduced. Anti&#8208;Markovnikov regioselective hydroboration of alkenes and alkynes was achieved, which was confirmed by deuterium&#8208;labelling experiments. The work represents the first example of the use of magnesium in homogeneous catalytic hydroboration of alkene with broad substrate scope. Experimental mechanistic investigations and DFT calculations provided insights into the reaction mechanism. Finally, the hydroboration protocol was extended to terpenes.

         <title>A Chemically Fuelled Molecular Automaton Displaying Programmed Migration of Zn2+ Between Alternative Binding Sites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Programmed autonomous migration of cations between alternative binding sites of a peptidomimetic ligand is driven by a fuelled change in acidity of the system. The rate of migration, and delays or resets in the execution of the program, may be controlled by the operating conditions of the molecular automaton.







Abstract
A molecular system comprising a cationic zinc complex and an amino acid&#8208;derived ambident ligand having phosphate and carboxylate binding sites undergoes a series of rearrangements in which the metal cation migrates autonomously from one site to another. The location of the metal is identified by the circular dichroism spectrum of a ligated bis(2&#8208;quinolylmethyl)&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine (BQPA) chromophore, which takes a characteristic shape at each binding site. Migration is fuelled by the decomposition of trichloroacetic acid to CO2 and CHCl3, which progressively neutralises the acidity of the system as a function of time, revealing in sequence binding sites of increasing basicity. The migration rate responds to control by variation of the temperature, water content and triethylamine concentration, while an excess of fuel controls the duration of an induction period before the migration event.

     alt="A Chemically Fuelled Molecular Automaton Displaying Programmed Migration of Zn2+ Between Alternative Binding Sites"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Programmed autonomous&lt;/b&gt; migration of cations between alternative binding sites of a peptidomimetic ligand is driven by a fuelled change in acidity of the system. The rate of migration, and delays or resets in the execution of the program, may be controlled by the operating conditions of the molecular automaton.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A molecular system comprising a cationic zinc complex and an amino acid-derived ambident ligand having phosphate and carboxylate binding sites undergoes a series of rearrangements in which the metal cation migrates autonomously from one site to another. The location of the metal is identified by the circular dichroism spectrum of a ligated bis(2-quinolylmethyl)-(2-pyridylmethyl)amine (BQPA) chromophore, which takes a characteristic shape at each binding site. Migration is fuelled by the decomposition of trichloroacetic acid to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CHCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which progressively neutralises the acidity of the system as a function of time, revealing in sequence binding sites of increasing basicity. The migration rate responds to control by variation of the temperature, water content and triethylamine concentration, while an excess of fuel controls the duration of an induction period before the migration event.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of 13C and 2H Labeled Vinyl Pyruvate and Hyperpolarization of Pyruvate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hyperpolarized pyruvate is a highly promising tracer for in&#8197;vivo metabolic MRI. A new synthetic approach provides access to the key precursor of 13C labeled vinyl pyruvate with up to 67&#8201;% yield (8&#8197;times higher than previous methods). After spin order transfer with parahydrogen, 12&#8201;% 13C polarization was obtained, which corresponds to a signal gain in NMR and MRI of 16 500 (9.4&#8197;T).







Abstract
The hyperpolarization of nuclear spins has enabled unique applications in chemistry, biophysics, and particularly metabolic imaging. Parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization (PHIP) offers a fast and cost&#8208;efficient way of hyperpolarization. Nevertheless, PHIP lags behind dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP), which is already being evaluated in clinical studies. This shortcoming is mainly due to problems in the synthesis of the corresponding PHIP precursor molecules. The most widely used DNP tracer in clinical studies, particularly for the detection of prostate cancer, is 1&#8208;13C&#8208;pyruvate. The ideal derivative for PHIP is the deuterated vinyl ester because the spin physics allows for 100&#8201;% polarization. Unfortunately, there is no efficient synthesis for vinyl esters of &#946;&#8208;ketocarboxylic acids in general and pyruvate in particular. Here, we present an efficient new method for the preparation of vinyl esters, including 13C labeled, fully deuterated vinyl pyruvate using a palladium&#8208;catalyzed procedure. Using 50&#8201;% enriched parahydrogen and mild reaction conditions, a 13C polarization of 12&#8201;% was readily achieved; 36&#8201;% are expected with 100&#8201;% pH2. Higher polarization values can be potentially achieved with optimized reaction conditions.

         <title>Dihydrogen Activation with a Neutral, Intermolecular Silicon(IV)&#8208;Amine Frustrated Lewis Pair</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silicon Lewis superacid with a novel perfluorinated ortho&#8208;aminophenol ligand is designed and used in FLP type H2 activation, enabling for the first time the formation of an hydridosilicate directly from H2. The narrow choice of the Lewis base and the reaction conditions emphasize the commonly encountered difficulties in this challenging hallmark FLP reaction.







Abstract
The heterolytic cleavage of dihydrogen constitutes the hallmark reaction of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP). While being well&#8208;established for planar Lewis acids, such as boranes or silylium ions, the observation of the primary H2 splitting products with non&#8208;planar Lewis acid FLPs remained elusive. In the present work, we report bis(perfluoro&#8208;N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;ortho&#8208;amidophenolato)silane and its application in dihydrogen activation to a fully characterized hydridosilicate. The strict design of the Lewis acid, the limited selection of the Lewis base, and the distinct reaction conditions emphasize the narrow tolerance to achieve this fascinating process with a tetrahedral Lewis acid.

         <title>Water Sorption Controls Extreme Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Molecular Reorganization in Hydrogen Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular frameworks assembled through charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonds are shown to undergo extreme molecular restructuring in response to stimuli (heat, vacuum, humidity). This restructuring involves the complete rotation of both building blocks and occurs in a single crystal to single crystal manner resulting in reversible high enthalpy water sorption in a 3D hydrogen bonded framework.







Abstract
As hydrogen bonded frameworks are held together by relatively weak interactions, they often form several different frameworks under slightly different synthesis conditions and respond dynamically to stimuli such as heat and vacuum. However, these dynamic restructuring processes are often poorly understood. In this work, three isoreticular hydrogen bonded organic frameworks assembled through charge&#8208;assisted amidinium&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;carboxylate hydrogen bonds (1C/C, 1Si/C and 1Si/Si) are studied. Three distinct phases for 1C/C and four for 1Si/C and 1Si/Si are fully structurally characterized. The transitions between these phases involve extreme yet recoverable molecular&#8208;level framework reorganization. It is demonstrated that these transformations are related to water content and can be controlled by humidity, and that the non&#8208;porous anhydrous phase of 1C/C shows reversible water sorption through single crystal to crystal restructuring. This mechanistic insight opens the way for the future use of the inherent dynamism present in hydrogen bonded frameworks.

         <dc:description>
Abracadabra! Homolytic bond cleavage enabled by visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced triplet&#8211;triplet energy transfer makes us think of a thioxanthone wizard who performs her magic when being excited in the spotlight. She transfers the energy with her wand to the vinyl triflimides thus inducing homolytic N&#8722;S bond cleavage to reveal radicals. Just like the divided woman, these recombine leading to &#945;&#8208;quaternary&#8208;&#946;&#8208;trifluoromethylated amines. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Niggemann and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201830).

         <title>Flexible Alkylene Bridges as a Tool To Engineer Crystal Distyrylbenzene Structures Enabling Highly Fluorescent Monomeric Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a new crystal engineering tool, we prepared organic solid&#8208;state light&#8208;emitting materials that exhibit very bright monomeric emissions. Introducing flexible alkylene bridges into distyrylbenzene (blue fluorescent dye) generated the desired crystal structure in which each dye is isolated in a compact space. More information can be found in the Research Article by G.&#8208;i. Konishi and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201884).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Using a new crystal engineering tool&lt;/b&gt;, we prepared organic solid-state light-emitting materials that exhibit very bright monomeric emissions. Introducing flexible alkylene bridges into distyrylbenzene (blue fluorescent dye) generated the desired crystal structure in which each dye is isolated in a compact space.

         <title>Structural insights into the very low activity of the homocoenzyme B12 adenosylmethylcobalamin in coenzyme B12&#8208;dependent diol dehydratase and ethanolamine ammonia&#8208;lyase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The X&#8208;ray structures of coenzyme B  12  (AdoCbl)&#8208;dependent eliminating isomerases complexed with adenosylmethylcobalamin (AdoMeCbl) were determined. As judged from geometries, its Co&#8208;C bond in diol dehydratase (DD) is not activated even in the presence of substrate. In ethanolamine ammonia&#8208;lyase (EAL), the bond is elongated in the absence of substrate, and in the presence of substrate, the complex likely exists in both pre&#8208; and post&#8208;homolysis states. The impacts of incorporation of an extra CH  2  group are different in the two enzymes: The DD active site is flexible and AdoMeCbl binding causes large conformational changes that make DD unable to adopt the catalytic state, whereas the EAL active site is rigid and AdoMeCbl binding does not induce significant conformational changes. Such flexibility and rigidity of the active sites may reflect the tightness of adenine binding. The structures provide good insights into the basis of the very low activity of AdoMeCbl in these enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Rationally Designed Bimetallic Platinum (II)&#8208;Ferrocene Antitumor Agent Induces Non&#8208;Apoptotic Cell Death and Exerts in Vivo Efficacy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 46, August 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterobimetallic platinum (II)&#8208;ferrocene hybrid 2 circumvents apoptosis and multifactorial cisplatin resistance, exhibits multi&#8208;pronged action in cancer cells &#8208; promoting necroptosis and paraptosis, and exerts in&#8197;vivo anticancer efficacy in mice xenograft model.







Abstract
Despite phenomenal clinical success, the efficacy of platinum anticancer drugs is often compromised due to inherent and acquired drug resistant phenotypes in cancers. To circumvent this issue, we designed two heterobimetallic platinum (II)&#8208;ferrocene hybrids that display multi&#8208;pronged anticancer action. In cancer cells, our best compound, 2, platinates DNA, produces reactive oxygen species, and has nucleus, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum as potential targets. The multi&#8208;modal mechanism of action of these hybrid agents lead to non&#8208;apoptotic cell death induction which enables circumventing apoptosis resistance and significant improvement in platinum cross resistance profile. Finally, in addition to describing detail mechanistic insights, we also assessed its stability in plasma and demonstrate anticancer efficacy in an in&#8197;vivo A2780 xenograft model. Strikingly, compared to oxaliplatin, our compound displays better tolerability, safety profile and efficacy in&#8197;vivo.

         <title>Persulfurated Benzene&#8208;Cored Asterisks with &#960;&#8208;Extended ThioNaphthyl Arms: Synthesis, Structural, Photophysical and Covalent Dynamic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 46, August 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regioisomeric asterisks (5&#8208;6) with naphthylthio arms are reported. Consequences on &#960;&#8208;extension around a persulfurated benzene bring different structural, photophysical and chemical properties. Sulfur exchanges reactions convert non emissive (5&#8211;6) into the best one (4). &#960;&#8208;Extension inhibits luminescence of a hexakis(phenylthio)benzene unit. Sc&#8208;XRD shows structural distortions and different behaviors of (5&#8211;6).







Abstract
The synthesis of regioisomeric asterisks (5) and (6) incorporating a benzene core with six 1&#8208;naphthylthio or six 2&#8208;naphthylthio arms are reported in search for new materials with optoelectronic properties. The consequences on the extension of a &#960; system surrounding a persulfurated benzene core provide a new avenue to study the structural, photophysical, and chemical properties of such family of all&#8208;organic phosphors. It also diverts the persulfuration mechanism after two radical cyclizations for making a [5]dithiohelicene by&#8208;product (7) and favors dynamic sulfur component exchange reactions surrounding the core. These exchanges convert asterisks (5) and (6), non&#8208;phosphorescent at 20&#8201;&#176;C to the highly phosphorescent (4) (&#981; &#8764;100&#8201;%, solid state at 20&#8201;&#176;C). For asterisks (5) and (6), the absence of the typical phosphorescence of the per(phenylthio)benzene core in the solid state at 20&#8201;&#176;C and the presence of a weak naphthalene&#8208;based phosphorescence at 77&#8197;K is attributed to an energy transfer from the triplet state of the persulfurated benzene core to the outer naphthalene moieties, resulting in an antenna system.

         <title>N&#8208;CF3 Imidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;one Derivatives via Photocatalytic and Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 46, August 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reported methodologies open access to the mono&#8208;substituted N&#8208;CF3 imidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ones at the 4&#8208;position which was previously inaccessible. Directly from the linear N&#8208;CF3 ureas bearing an alkene moiety, N&#8208;CF3 imidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ones were prepared via Ag&#8208;catalysis and light assisted proton coupled electron transfer. Instead of prior modification of the alkene moiety, tandem PCET and Nickel catalysis were shown to increase the diversity of the core. The cyclic compounds were then treated under various conditions to modify the core structure to introduce structural complexity.







Abstract
While the N&#8208;trifluoromethylation of cyclic ureas is of interest for the potential to fundamentally change the properties of these biologically relevant moieties, the single synthetic procedure known to date describing their access only gives 4,4&#8208;disubstituted or fused aromatic cyclic N&#8208;CF3 urea derivatives. We herein report an alternative approach to unleash access to the 4&#8208;monosubstituted imidazolidinone motif. The strategy relies on straightforward cyclization of readily accessible acyclic ureas, enabled by Ag&#8208;catalysis or light&#8208;assisted proton coupled electron transfer. The cyclic core is shown to be highly robust and amenable to various derivatizations, such as tandem Ni&#8208;catalysis, C&#8722;B, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;C cross couplings or C&#8722;H functionalizations, tolerating basic, nucleophilic and/or oxidizing conditions.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The reported methodologies&lt;/b&gt; open access to the mono-substituted &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; imidazolidin-2-ones at the 4-position which was previously inaccessible. Directly from the linear &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ureas bearing an alkene moiety, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; imidazolidin-2-ones were prepared via Ag-catalysis and light assisted proton coupled electron transfer. Instead of prior modification of the alkene moiety, tandem PCET and Nickel catalysis were shown to increase the diversity of the core. The cyclic compounds were then treated under various conditions to modify the core structure to introduce structural complexity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-trifluoromethylation of cyclic ureas is of interest for the potential to fundamentally change the properties of these biologically relevant moieties, the single synthetic procedure known to date describing their access only gives 4,4-disubstituted or fused aromatic cyclic &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; urea derivatives. We herein report an alternative approach to unleash access to the 4-monosubstituted imidazolidinone motif. The strategy relies on straightforward cyclization of readily accessible acyclic ureas, enabled by Ag-catalysis or light-assisted proton coupled electron transfer. The cyclic core is shown to be highly robust and amenable to various derivatizations, such as tandem Ni-catalysis, C&#8722;B, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;C cross couplings or C&#8722;H functionalizations, tolerating basic, nucleophilic and/or oxidizing conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulated Synthesis of Self&#8208;Standing Covalent Organic Framework Films</title>

         <dc:description>
A modulated strategy was developed for the synthesis of self&#8208;standing COF films with good crystallinity and tunable thickness. As compared with the non&#8208;modulated method, the modulated approach changes the COF morphology from nanoparticles to nanofibers, enabling the facile preparation of self&#8208;standing COF films with improved mechanical properties. The Young's modulus of the self&#8208;standing COF film obtained via the modulated strategy could increase by 26&#8197;times.







Abstract
The weak interaction of covalent organic framework (COF) nanoparticles makes the preparation of self&#8208;standing COF films difficult. Herein, a modulated strategy for the facile synthesis of self&#8208;standing COF films with good crystallinity and tunable thickness is reported. As compared with the non&#8208;modulated approach, the modulated strategy changes the COF morphology from nanoparticles to nanofibers, enabling the facile preparation of self&#8208;standing COF films with improved mechanical properties. The Young's modulus of the self&#8208;standing COF film obtained via the modulated strategy could increase by 26&#8197;times. Moreover, self&#8208;standing LZU&#8208;8 film can be used as a membrane for efficient removal of 99&#8201;% mercury ions from aqueous solution. Our results open up a new approach to prepare self&#8208;standing COF thin films for practical applications.

Pack more into the box: How to fit two metal ions in one porphyrin. Porphyrins&#8217; default coordination mode allows the binding of a single metal cation in the central NNNN cavity. In order to allow the accommodation of two metal ions inside a standard porphyrin perimeter, they are introduced in place of two inner NH groups, yielding a 21,23&#8208;dimetallaporphyrin. The 18&#8208;&#960;&#8208;electron aromatic circuit is maintained, playing a crucial role in macrocycle stabilization, and enforcing the metal centers&#8217; proximity.







Abstract
Tetraaryl&#8208;21,23&#8208;dirhodaporphyrin and a series of related monorhodaporphyrins have been obtained by tellurium&#8208;to&#8208;rhodium exchange in a reaction of tetraaryl&#8208;21,23&#8208;ditelluraporphyrin with [RhCl(CO)2]2. These organometallic metallaporphyrins contain rhodium(III) centers embedded in rhodacyclopentadiene rings, incorporated within the porphyrin frames. The skeletons of 21,23&#8208;dirhodaporphyrin and 21&#8208;rhoda&#8208;23&#8208;telluraporphyrin are strongly deformed in&#8208;plane from the rectangular shape typical for porphyrins, due to rhodium(III) coordination preferences, the large size of the two core atoms, and the porphyrin skeleton constrains. These two metallaporphyrins exhibit fluxional behavior, as studied by 1H NMR and DFT, involving the in&#8208;plane motion and the switch of the rhodium center(s) between two nitrogen donors. A side product detected in the reaction mixture, 21&#8208;oxa&#8208;23&#8208;rhodaporphyrin, results from tellurium&#8208;to&#8208;oxygen exchange, occurring in parallel to the tellurium&#8208;to&#8208;rhodium exchange. The reaction paths and mechanisms have been analyzed. The title 21,23&#8208;dirhodaporphyrin contains a bridged bimetallic unit, Rh2Cl2, in the center of the macrocycle, with two rhodium(III) ions lying approximately in the plane of the porphyrinoid skeleton. The geometry of the implanted Rh2Cl2 unit is affected by macrocyclic constrains.

         <title>Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Activated Liposomal Cell Delivery using a Boronate&#8208;Caged Guanidine Lipid</title>

         <dc:description>
A boronate&#8208;caged guanidine&#8208;lipid for enhancing liposome cellular delivery mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) was reported. Our results showcase that this lipid enables cell delivery only after being activated in the presence of ROS. This approach exhibits strong potential as an ROS&#8208;responsive liposomal platform for targeted drug delivery applications.







Abstract
We report boronate&#8208;caged guanidine&#8208;lipid 1 that activates liposomes for cellular delivery only upon uncaging of this compound by reactive oxygen species (ROS) to produce cationic lipid products. These liposomes are designed to mimic the exceptional cell delivery properties of cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs), while the inclusion of the boronate cage is designed to enhance selectivity such that cell entry will only be activated in the presence of ROS. Boronate uncaging by hydrogen peroxide was verified by mass spectrometry and zeta potential (ZP) measurements. A microplate&#8208;based fluorescence assay was developed to study the ROS&#8208;mediated vesicle interactions between 1&#8208;liposomes and anionic membranes, which were further elucidated via dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis. Cellular delivery studies utilizing fluorescence microscopy demonstrated significant enhancements in cellular delivery only when 1&#8208;liposomes were incubated with hydrogen peroxide. Our results showcase that lipid 1 exhibits strong potential as an ROS&#8208;responsive liposomal platform for targeted drug delivery applications.

         <title>Effect of Annulation Mode of Twistarene on the Physical Property and Self&#8208;Assembly Behavior of Functionalized Curved Aromatic Molecules</title>

         <dc:description>
Constructing novel curved polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is of great significance. Herein this work describes the design and modular preparation of four novel arenes where their structures are determined via X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. The effect of annulation mode of twistarenes on the physical properties, self&#8208;assembly behaviors and switchable photoconductivity of such curved molecules were investigated in detail.







Abstract
Four novel curved polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3&#8201;a, 5, 8, 15&#8201;a have been synthesized and characterized, where molecules 3&#8201;a and 15&#8201;a bear [5]carbohelicene units. X&#8208;ray single crystal analyses indicate that compound 3&#8201;a shows offset packing arrangements of (P5)&#8208; and (M5)&#8208;isomers, and 15&#8201;a has a symmetrical plane and looks like a butterfly. In comparison, 8 exhibits a slightly curved structure, in which the significant convex&#8208;to&#8208;convex &#960;&#8208;overlap with the shortest distance of 3.42&#8197;&#197; occurs. In addition, the effect of annulation mode of twistarenes on the physical properties, self&#8208;assembly behaviors, and switchable photoconductivity of the as&#8208;prepared curved aromatic compounds were further examined in a comparative manner.

In comparison, &lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt; exhibits a slightly curved structure, in which the significant convex-to-convex &#960;-overlap with the shortest distance of 3.42&#8197;&#197; occurs. In addition, the effect of annulation mode of twistarenes on the physical properties, self-assembly behaviors, and switchable photoconductivity of the as-prepared curved aromatic compounds were further examined in a comparative manner.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biomimetic Synthesis of Nor&#8208;Cedrene and Nor&#8208;Isozizaene Sesquiterpenoids and Exploration of Their Olfactive Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 46, August 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical synthesis of isozizaene&#8208; and cedrene&#8208;type nor&#8208;sesquiterpenoids from a simple bio&#8208;inspired precursor nor&#8208;bisabolyl epoxide is described. This key intermediate undergoes selective cyclization cascades without the need for enzymatic control. By choosing cationic or radical cyclization conditions, each sesquiterpene scaffold could be prepared selectively and led to the discovery of new woody odorants of perfumery interest.







Abstract
We report the preparation of nor&#8208;bisabolyl epoxide 13 and its use as a common biomimetic intermediate for the synthesis of nor&#8208;sesquiterpenoids. Through a cationic cyclization cascade pathway, we prepared nor&#8208;isozizaenol 25, ultimately constituting an eight&#8208;step access to this complex sesquiterpenoid from inexpensive and abundant starting materials. Using a radical cyclization cascade pathway, we prepared nor&#8208;cedryl alcohol 26 from the same intermediate. Derivatization of these two products led to the discovery of two potent woody odorants of interest in perfumery.

         <title>Photothermal Oxidation of Cinnamyl Alcohol with Hydrogen Peroxide Catalyzed by Gold Nanoparticle/Antimony&#8208;Doped Tin Oxide Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 46, August 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The heat is on: Gold/antimony&#8208;doped tin oxide nanocrystals show thermally activated catalytic activity for the oxidation of cinnamyl alcohol to cinnamaldehyde by hydrogen peroxide. The catalytic activity increases with an increase in the Au particle size (dAu) at 5.3&#8804;dAu&#8804;8.2&#8197;nm. Light irradiation (&#955;ex &gt;660&#8197;nm, &#8764;0.5 sun) of Au/ATO NCs gives rise to an increase in the rate of reaction of more than two times with &#8764;95&#8201;% selectivity due to the photothermal effect of ATO NCs.







Abstract
Gold nanoparticles with different mean sizes were formed on antimony&#8208;doped tin oxide nanocrystals by the temperature&#8208;varied deposition&#8208;precipitation method (Au/ATO NCs). Au/ATO NCs possess strong absorption in the near&#8208;infrared region due to Drude excitation in addition to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of AuNPs around 530&#8197;nm. Au/ATO NCs show thermally activated catalytic activity for the oxidation of cinnamyl alcohol to cinnamaldehyde by hydrogen peroxide. The catalytic activity increases with a decrease in the mean Au particle size (dAu) at 5.3&#8197;nm&#8804;dAu&#8804;8.2&#8197;nm. Light irradiation (&#955;ex &gt;660&#8197;nm, &#8764;0.5 sun) of Au/ATO NCs increases the rate of reaction by more than twice with &#8764;95&#8201;% selectivity. Kinetic analyses indicated that the striking enhancement of the reaction stems from the rise in the temperature near the catalyst surface of &#8764;30&#8197;K due to the photothermal effect of the ATO NCs.

         <title>A Highly Water&#8208; and Air&#8208;Stable Iron&#8208;Containing MRI Contrast Agent Sensor for H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 46, August 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An Fe(II) complex with the macrocyclic quinol&#8208;containing ligand H4qp4 displays high water&#8208; and air&#8208;stability. The complex rapidly reacts with H2O2, but not O2, to yield Fe(III) complexes with oxidized ligands that contain para&#8208;quinone groups. Upon oxidation by H2O2, the r1 increases by over four&#8208;fold, enabling the Fe(II) complex to act as an MRI contrast agent sensor for this reactive oxygen species.







Abstract
A highly water&#8208; and air&#8208;stable Fe(II) complex with the quinol&#8208;containing macrocyclic ligand H4qp4 reacts with H2O2 to yield Fe(III) complexes with less highly chelating forms of the ligand that have either one or two para&#8208;quinones. The reaction increases the T1&#8208;weighted relaxivity over four&#8208;fold, enabling the complex to detect H2O2 using clinical MRI technology. The iron&#8208;containing sensor differs from its recently characterized manganese analog, which also detects H2O2, in that it is the oxidation of the metal center, rather than the ligand, that primarily enhances the relaxivity.

         <title>Dissecting Noncovalent Interactions in Carboxyl&#8208;Functionalized Ionic Liquids Exhibiting Double and Single Hydrogens Bonds Between Ions of Like Charge</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 46, August 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Like&#8208;likes&#8208;like charge attraction is observed for a carboxyl&#8208;functionalized ionic liquid that exhibits three kind of hydrogen bond: the expected single hydrogen bonds between cation and anion, and, surprisingly, single and double hydrogen bonds between the cations, despite the repulsive Coulomb forces between the ions of like charge. Combining X&#8208;ray crystallography, differential scanning calorimetry, IR spectroscopy, thermodynamic methods and DFT calculations allowed all kind of hydrogen bonds present in the solid, liquid and gaseous states to be addressed.







Abstract
We show that the carboxyl&#8208;functionalized ionic liquid 1&#8208;(carboxymethyl)pyridinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [HOOC&#8208;CH2&#8208;py][NTf2] exhibits three types of hydrogen bonding: the expected single hydrogen bonds between cation and anion, and, surprisingly, single and double hydrogen bonds between the cations, despite the repulsive Coulomb forces between the ions of like charge. Combining X&#8208;ray crystallography, differential scanning calorimetry, IR spectroscopy, thermodynamic methods and DFT calculations allows the analysis and characterization of all types of hydrogen bonding present in the solid, liquid and gaseous states of the ionic liquid (IL). We find doubly hydrogen bonded cationic dimers (c+=c+) in the crystalline phase. With increasing temperature, this binding motif opens in the liquid and is replaced by (c+&#8722;c+&#8722;a&#8722; species, with a remaining single cationic hydrogen bond and an additional hydrogen bond between cation and anion. We provide clear evidence that the IL evaporates as hydrogen&#8208;bonded ion pairs (c+&#8722;a&#8722;) into the gas phase. The measured transition enthalpies allow the noncovalent interactions to be dissected and the hydrogen bond strength between ions of like charge to be determined.

         <title>Tuning Deazaflavins Towards Highly Potent Reducing Photocatalysts Guided by Mechanistic Understanding &#8211; Enhancement of the Key Step by the Internal Heavy Atom Effect</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 46, August 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by nature and based on mechanistic understanding, we designed deazaflavins (dFl) with reducing powers comparable to Li which function via the consecutive photo&#8208;induced electron transfer (conPET) mechanism independently on molecular oxygen. The internal heavy atom effect (IHAE) by introducing bromine into the photocatalyst enhances considerably the key triplet pathway via a triplet&#8208;born radical pair. Furthermore, an optimal concentration of the sacrificial electron donor (Ssac) is required for bypassing the unproductive reaction via the singlet&#8208;born radical pair.







Abstract
Deazaflavins are well suited for reductive chemistry acting via a consecutive photo&#8208;induced electron transfer, in which their triplet state and semiquinone &#8211; the latter is formed from the former after electron transfer from a sacrificial electron donor &#8211; are key intermediates. Guided by mechanistic investigations aiming to increase intersystem crossing by the internal heavy atom effect and optimising the concentration conditions to avoid unproductive excited singlet reactions, we synthesised 5&#8208;aryldeazaflavins with Br or Cl substituents on different structural positions via a three&#8208;component reaction. Bromination of the deazaisoalloxazine core leads to almost 100&#8201;% triplet yield but causes photo&#8208;instability and enhances unproductive side reactions. Bromine on the 5&#8208;phenyl group in ortho position does not affect the photostability, increases the triplet yield, and allows its efficient usage in the photocatalytic dehalogenation of bromo&#8208; and chloroarenes with electron&#8208;donating methoxy and alkyl groups even under aerobic conditions. Reductive powers comparable to lithium are achieved.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Synthesized Cd&#8208;Doped Cs3Cu2I5: Stable and Excitation&#8208;Wavelength Dependent Dual&#8208;Color Emission for Advanced Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 46, August 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cd&#8208;doped Cs3Cu2I5 was synthesized by room&#8208;temperature grinding. [CuI4] and [CdI4] tetrahedrons act as photoluminescent centers separately, resulting in the emission colour manipulated by not only Cd feeding amount but also excitation wavelength. The as&#8208;prepared Cd&#8208;doped Cs3Cu2I5 was made into anti&#8208;counterfeiting ink and printed on paper. The pattern shows different colours when the excitation wavelength increases from 310&#8197;nm to 330&#8197;nm.







Abstract
With the development of intellectual properties, concern about advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting is accumulating, which conventional single&#8208;modal luminescence can no longer satisfy. As one of rapidly developing 0D materials, copper&#8208;based perovskite shows great potential to realize multiple luminescent centers for complex emissions. In this work, Cd was doped into Cs3Cu2I5 and showed resultant emission at 560&#8197;nm which surprisingly showed a red&#8208;shifted excitation peak from that of intrinsic self&#8208;trapped emission, resulting in excitation&#8208;wavelength dependent emission. When the excitation wavelength increased from 290&#8197;nm to 330&#8197;nm, the emission of Cd&#8208;doped Cs3Cu2I5 changed from deep blue to cold white and finally yellow. Afterwards, Cd&#8208;doped Cs3Cu2I5 was mixed with polystyrene to prepare anti&#8208;counterfeiting ink for silk&#8208;screen printing. Meanwhile, Cd&#8208;doped Cs3Cu2I5 maintains outstanding stability after doping, no matter under ambient, continuous UV radiation or high&#8208;temperature environment. The intensity can be almost totally recovered after heating&#8208;and&#8208;cooling cycles. This study lays groundwork for future research into multiple luminescent center manipulation in 0D materials.

         <title>Ag Doped Au44 Nanoclusters for Electrocatalytic Conversion of CO2 to CO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 46, August 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Ag doped Ag4+xAu40&#8208;x(C10H9)28 (x&#8804;6) cluster has been synthesized and the Ag doping positions can be precisely determined. The electrochemical reduction process of CO2 to CO can be promoted by Ag doping into Au cluster, due to the modulated electronic properties and structural reconstruction by Ag doping. The work provides an opportunity for understanding the heteroatom&#8208;doping role in modulating the catalytic properties of metal clusters.







Abstract
A novel Ag doped Au44(C10H9)28 nanocluster (C10H10=1&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;2,4&#8208;dimethylbenzene) was synthesized, that is, Ag4+xAu40&#8208;x(C10H9)28 (x&#8804;6), where four Ag positions located in the surface staple of the cluster have been determined, while six Au/Ag co&#8208;occupying positions have been found in the metal core of the cluster. The electronic configuration of Au44(C10H9)28 cluster is significantly disturbed by doping Ag atoms, hence promoting the electron transport capability. For the two&#8208;electron conversion reaction of CO2 to CO in electrochemical reduction of CO2, Ag doped Ag4+xAu40&#8208;x(C10H9)28 catalyst exhibited higher effective activity and long&#8208;term stability than its counterpart Au44(C10H9)28 catalyst.

         <title>Synthesis of Oxygenated Sesquiterpenoids Enabled by Combining Metabolic Engineering and Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 46, August 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bio&#8208;Chem collaboration: Escherichia coli fermentation and visible&#8208;light photocatalysis were combined in a complementary way for the first time, to realize the scaffold assembly in a &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; fashion and the subsequent diversifications in a &#8220;one&#8208;step&#8221; manner, respectively, enabling the production of six sesquiterpenoids.







Abstract
The diversification of natural products to expand biologically relevant chemical space for drug discovery can be achieved by combining complementary bioprocessing and chemical transformations. Herein, genetically engineered Escherichia coli fermentation to produce amorphadiene and valencene was combined with metal&#8208;free photocatalysis transformations to further access nootkatone, cis&#8208;nootkatol and two hydration derivatives. In fermentation, using a closed, anaerobic condition avoided the use of organic overlay, increased the productivity, and simplified the work&#8208;up process. Metal&#8208;free photocatalysis hydration and allylic C&#8722;H oxidation were designed and implemented to make the whole process greener. It was shown that the anti&#8208;Markovnikov selectivity of photocatalyzed alkene hydration could be reversed by stereo&#8208;electronic and steric effects existing in complex natural products. The combination of bioprocessing and photocatalysis may provide an efficient and greener way to expand the chemical space for pharmaceutical, flavor and fragrance industry.

         <title>Alkylation of Nitroarenes via Vicarious Nucleophilic Substitution &#8211; Experimental and DFT Mechanistic Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 46, August 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkylation of nitroarenes via Vicarious Nucleophilic Substitution (VNS) was tested experimentally and modelled with DFT calculations. Mechanistic studies reveal intrinsic differences between reactions of archetypal carbanion precursor PhSO2CH2Cl, and alkyl phenyl sulfones, in which benzenesulfinate acts as a leaving group. Accordingly, for the latter precursors steric hindrance develops at the &#946;&#8208;elimination step, that raises energy barrier and results in the formation of byproducts.

Dedicated to NSYSU Chemistry Department's 40th Anniversary. The design incorporates some of NSYSU's distinct features. These are the scenic Sizihwan bay, famous for its beautiful sunset, and the Monkey Mountain, home to the endemic Formosan rock macaques. Starting from the Aza&#8208;o&#8208;QM mountain, different N&#8208;heterocycles were obtained through reactions aided by the representative chiral catalysts shown in the sun. The flapping of the birds&#8217; wings cleverly depicts the flow of the process. For more information, see the Review by H.&#8208;H. Liao, M. Rueping and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201112)

         <title>Cover Feature: Photothermal Oxidation of Cinnamyl Alcohol with Hydrogen Peroxide Catalyzed by Gold Nanoparticle/Antimony&#8208;Doped Tin Oxide Nanocrystals (Chem. Eur. J. 46/2022)</title>

         <dc:description>
Gold nanoparticle&#8208;loaded, antimony&#8208;doped tin oxide nanocrystals (Au/ATO NCs) show thermally activated catalytic activity for the oxidation of cinnamyl alcohol to cinnamaldehyde by hydrogen peroxide. Light irradiation (&#955;ex&gt;660&#8197;nm, &#8764;0.5 sun) of Au/ATO NCs gives rise to a more than twofold increase in the rate of reaction with &#8764;95&#8201;% selectivity. Kinetic analyses indicated that the striking enhancement of the reaction stems from the rise in the temperature near the catalyst surface of &#8764;30&#8197;K due to the photothermal effect of the ATO NCs. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Tada and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201653).

Dwarfs are shown fixing two rhodium atoms into the skeleton of 21,23&#8208;dirhodaporphyrin, the first [18]porphyrin to incorporate two metal atoms within its macrocyclic frame, in place of two core nitrogen donors. The 18&#8208;&#960;&#8208;electron aromatic circuit is maintained, playing a crucial role in stabilizing the macrocycle, and enforcing the metal centers&#8242; proximity. These small metal sculptures of dwarfs are a tourist attraction scattered around Wroc&#322;aw, the city in Poland where the dirhodaporphyrin was synthesized. More information can be found in the Research Article by E. Pacholska&#8208;Dudziak and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201513).

         <dc:description>
Like&#8208;charge attraction is observed for carboxyl&#8208;functionalized ionic liquids. In the solid state, doubly hydrogen&#8208;bonded cationic dimers dominate. In the liquid, these structural motifs are replaced by single hydrogen bonds between like&#8208; and oppositely charged ions. Combining X&#8208;ray crystallography, IR spectroscopy, thermodynamic methods and DFT calculations allows all types of hydrogen bonding in the solid, liquid and gaseous states of the ionic liquid to be analyzed and characterized. More information can be found in the Research Article by R. Ludwig and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200949).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 46, August 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methide (aza&#8208;o&#8208;QM) chemistry has been showing budding progress in the past years. Herein, the asymmetric catalysis involving these transient intermediates is highlighted, which was made possible by well&#8208;designed catalysts as well as new aza&#8208;o&#8208;QM precursors/substrates.







Abstract
The aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methide (aza&#8208;o&#8208;QM) chemistry has overwhelmingly progressed in the past few decades. This review aims to integrate various transition metal&#8208;catalyzed and organocatalytic strategies in taming aza&#8208;o&#8208;QM intermediates, including the aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;vinylidene quinone methide (aza&#8208;o&#8208;VQM), aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;alkynyl quinone methide (aza&#8208;o&#8208;AQM), aza&#8208;para&#8208;quinone methide (aza&#8208;p&#8208;QM), and indole&#8208;based aza&#8208;o&#8208;QM analog. These transient species are often utilized for the direct and enantioselective synthesis of complex (hetero)polycyclic or fused&#8208;ring molecular scaffolds such as tetrahydroquinoline and indoline, among others, which are abundant in many natural products, bioactive compounds, and pharmaceuticals.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The aza-&lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-quinone&lt;/b&gt; methide (aza-&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-QM) chemistry has been showing budding progress in the past years. Herein, the asymmetric catalysis involving these transient intermediates is highlighted, which was made possible by well-designed catalysts as well as new aza-&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-QM precursors/substrates.

         <title>Chemiluminescent Imaging Assay of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Protein with Target&#8208;Induced Enzyme Activity Regulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Simple but robust testing assays are essential for screening and diagnosis of individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) in COVID&#8208;19 pandemic. Here,  we described  a  chemiluminescent imaging assay  (  CLIA  ) for  sensitive and convenient  detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) by a target&#8208;induced enzyme activity regulation (T&#8208;EAR) strategy.  The T&#8208;EAR used a pair of antibody&#8208;DNA probes to recognize SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 NP and proximity&#8208;induced rolling circle amplification for mass&#8208;production of pyrophosphate to coordinate with Cu  2+  , which prevented the reduction of Cu  2+  to Cu  +  by sodium ascorbate as well as the Cu  +  &#8208;caused inactivation of horseradish peroxidase (HRP).  The activity retention of HRP produced strong CL signal for the detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 NP by catalyzing the oxidation of luminol by H  2  O  2  . The  T&#8208;EAR based  CLIA  showed a wide detection range from 1 pg/mL to 100 ng/mL&#160;  (13 fM to 1.3 nM)  with the requirement of only 0.75 &#956;L of sample.  This CLIA had advantages of good sensitivity, simple  wash&#8208;free  operation, acceptable accuracy, and  high&#8208;throughput imaging detection  , displaying potential applicability in  screening assay of COVID&#8208;19 infection  .</dc:description>

         <title>Theoretical Perspectives in Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computational approaches to organocatalysis: This review is focused on the different computational approaches that have been applied within the organocatalysis field. A huge effort from the theoretical chemistry field has been made in order to prove that de novo design of effective catalysts for different types of reactions is a long&#8208;term target, yet a palpable phenomenon.







Abstract
It is clear that the field of organocatalysis is continuously expanding during the last decades. With increasing computational capacity and new techniques, computational methods have provided a more economic approach to explore different chemical systems. This review offers a broad yet concise overview of current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art studies that have employed novel strategies for catalyst design. The evolution of the all different theoretical approaches most commonly used within organocatalysis is discussed, from the traditional approach, manual&#8208;driven, to the most recent one, machine&#8208;driven.

         <title>Enhanced Metal&#8211;Semiconductor Interaction for Photocatalytic Hydrogen&#8208;Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interfacial engineering of photodeposited Au/TiO2 with enhanced metal&#8211;semiconductor interaction and ultrafine Au nanoparticles by a sacrificial carbon&#8208;coating annealing strategy facilitates to transfer photogenerated electrons from TiO2 to nanosized Au to drive photocatalytic hydrogen production.







Abstract
The selective immobilization of noble metals right at the place where photogenerated electrons migrate through the photodeposition approach is a unique strategy to load cocatalysts on semiconductors for solar hydrogen production. However, a poor metal&#8211;semiconductor interaction is often formed, which not only hinders the interfacial charge transfer, but also results in the easy aggregation and shedding of cocatalysts during photocatalytic reactions. Herein, it is demonstrated that the photodeposited ultrafine metals, such as nanosized Au, can be well stabilized on TiO2 nanocrystallines without sintering by employing a sacrificial carbon coating annealing strategy to strengthen the metal&#8208;support interaction. Benefiting from the improved interfacial contact between Au and TiO2 for fast charge transfer and the well&#8208;preserved size&#8208;dependent catalytic behavior of Au nanoparticles toward hydrogen evolution reaction, the annealed Au/TiO2 exhibits a significant enhanced activity toward photocatalytic H2 production with good durability.

         <title>Dual MOF&#8208;derived MoS2/CdS Photocatalysts with Rich Sulfur Vacancies for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coctalyst&#160;plays an important role in efficient charge transfer and separation for photocatalysis. Herein,a MoS  2  /CdS photocatalyst with MoS  2  as cocatalyst was designed by using Mo&#8208;MOF and Cd&#8208;MOF as precursors. Due to the existence of rich sulfur vacancies and 1T phase,&#160;MoS  2  shows strong charge capture and transport ability.&#160;The photo&#8208;generated electrons on conduction band (CB) can be bounded by the sulfur vacancy of CdS and effectively transported to MoS  2  through the compact interface between the CdS nanoparticles and 2D large&#8208;scale MoS  2  .The optimal photocatalyst 1%MoS  2  /CdS exhibited dramatically improved photocatalytic hydrogen production activity,&#160;which is 28 times that of pristine CdS and even about 2 times that of 1%Pt/CdS with same loading amount of noble metal Pt.&#160;This work highlights the role of Mo&#8208;MOF derived MoS  2  with 1T&#8208;2H phases as a sustainable and prospective candidate of cocatalyst for improving charge separation and photocatalytic stability of MoS  2  /CdS composites.</dc:description>

Due to the existence of rich sulfur vacancies and 1T phase,&#160;MoS  2  shows strong charge capture and transport ability.&#160;The photo-generated electrons on conduction band (CB) can be bounded by the sulfur vacancy of CdS and effectively transported to MoS  2  through the compact interface between the CdS nanoparticles and 2D large-scale MoS  2  .The optimal photocatalyst 1%MoS  2  /CdS exhibited dramatically improved photocatalytic hydrogen production activity,&#160;which is 28 times that of pristine CdS and even about 2 times that of 1%Pt/CdS with same loading amount of noble metal Pt.&#160;This work highlights the role of Mo-MOF derived MoS  2  with 1T-2H phases as a sustainable and prospective candidate of cocatalyst for improving charge separation and photocatalytic stability of MoS  2  /CdS composites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polymerization, Stimuli&#8208;induced Depolymerization, and Precipitation&#8208;driven Macrocyclization in a Nitroaldol Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. Dynamic covalent polymers of different topology have been synthesized from an aromatic dialdehyde and &#945;,&#969;dinitroalkanes via the nitroaldol reaction. All dinitroalkanes yielded dynamers with the dialdehyde, where the length of the dinitroalkane chain played a vital role in determining the structure of the final products. For longer dinitroalkanes, linear dynamers were produced, where the degree of polymerization reached a plateau at higher feed concentrations. In the reactions involving 1,4&#8208;dinitrobutane and 1,5dinitropentane, specific macrocycles were formed through depolymerization of the linear chains, further driven by precipitation. At lower temperature, the same systemic self&#8208;sorting effect was also observed for the 1,6&#8208;dinitrohexane&#8208;based dynamers. Moreover, the dynamers showed a clear adaptive behavior, displaying depolymerization and rearrangement of the dynamer chains in response to alternative building blocks as external stimuli.</dc:description>

         <title>Solar Driven Gas Phase Advanced Oxidation Processes for Methane Removal &#8211; Challenges and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methane (CH  4  ) is a potent greenhouse gas and the second highest contributor to global warming. CH  4  emissions are still growing at an alarmingly high pace. To limit global warming to 1.5  o  C, one of the most effective strategies is to reduce rapidly the CH  4  emissions by developing large&#8208;scale methane removal methods. The purpose of this perspective paper is threefold. (1) To highlight the technology gap dealing with low concentration CH  4  (at many emission sources and in the atmosphere). (2) To analyze the challenges and prospects of solar&#8208;driven gas phase advanced oxidation processes for CH  4  removal. And (3) to propose some ideas, which may help to develop solar&#8208;driven gas phase advanced oxidation processes and make them deployable at a climate significant scale.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cysteine bioconjugation serves as a powerful tool in biological research and has been widely used for the chemical modification of proteins, constructing antibody&#8208;drug conjugates, and enabling cell imaging studies. Cysteine conjugation reactions with fast kinetics and exquisite selectivity have been under heavy pursuit as they would allow clean protein modification with just stoichiometric amount of reagents, which minimizes side reaction, simplifies purification and broadens the functional group tolerance. In this concept, we summarize the recent advances of fast cysteine bioconjugation, and discuss the mechanism and chemical principles that underlie the high efficiencies of the newly developed cysteine reactive reagents.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence of a Dinuclear Platinum(II) Compound: Mechanism and Roles of an Upper Triplet State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A dinuclear Pt(II) compound was reported to exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF); however, the luminescence mechanism remains elusive. To reveal relevant excited&#8208;state properties and luminescence mechanism of this Pt(II) compound, both density function theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations were carried out in this work. In terms of the results, the S  1  and T  2  states show mixed inter&#8208;ligand charge transfer (ILCT)/metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand CT (MLCT) characters while the T  1  state exhibits mixed ILCT/ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal CT (LMCT) characters. Mechanistically, a four&#8208;state (S  0  , S  1  , T  1  , and T  2  ) model is proposed to rationalize the TADF behavior. The reverse intersystem crossing (rISC) process from the initial T  1  to final S  1  states involves two up&#8208;conversion channels (  direct T  1  &#8594;S  1  and T  2  &#8208;mediated T  1  &#8594;  T  2  &#8594;  S  1  pathways) and both play crucial roles in TADF. At 300 K, these two channels are much faster than the T  1&#160;  phosphorescence emission enabling TADF. However, at 80 K, these rISC rates are reduced by several orders of magnitude and become very small, which blocks the TADF emission; instead, only the phosphorescence is observed. These findings rationalize the experimental observation and could provide useful guidance to rational design of organometallic materials with superior TADF performances.</dc:description>

         <title>Dipole&#8208;Dipole and Anion&#8208;&#960;+ Interaction Manipulation Synergistically Enhance Intrinsic Antibacterial Activities of AIEgens</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pathogenic bacteria infections, especially multidrug resistant bacteria infections have aroused worldwide attention due to their severe threats to human beings. Thus, the development of highly effective antibacterial reagents is very important but still quite challenging for the lack of a universal design strategy. Here, a synergistic manipulation strategy of dipole&#8208;dipole and anion&#8208;&#960;  +  interaction was proposed for constructing highly efficient antimicrobials with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) feature. Firstly, four anion&#8208;&#960;  +  &#8208;type AIE luminogens were designed and synthesized. Due to the electron&#8208;donating and hydrophilic characteristic of methoxy groups, 3MOTPO containing three methoxy groups showed the largest dipole moment (5.06 Debey) and dual anion&#8208;&#960;  +  interactions in the solid state. Driven by both dipole&#8208;dipole and anion&#8208;&#960;  +  interactions, 3MOTPO showed the strongest bacterial binding ability and the best antibacterial activities (MIC  90  = 3.76 &#956;M). The work offers a deep insight into the rational design of highly efficient antimicrobials for luminescence&#8208;guided antibacterial study.</dc:description>

         <title>Pillararene&#8208;Based Supramolecular Vesicles for Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular vesicles (SMVs) self&#8208;assembled from the supra&#8208;amphiphiles, consisting of two scaffolds linked together through noncovalent interactions, can realize stimuli&#8208;responsive controlled release of encapsulated drugs for enhanced therapeutic efficacy and minimized side effect of drugs. Pillararenes (PAs), an emerging kind of macrocyclic hosts in 2008, are easy to modify with a variety of functionalities. SMVs from PAs and specific guests mainly based on the host&#8211;guest interactions have attracted increasing attention because of their drug delivery and controlled drug release. A great progress in the construction and stimuli&#8208;responsive drug delivery of the PA&#8208;based SMVs has been made since the first work was reported in 2012. This review summarizes the major achievements of the PA&#8208;based SMVs for stimuli&#8208;responsive drug delivery over the past 5 years, including the microstructures of SMVs, multiple stimuli&#8208;responsive SMVs, prodrug SMVs from prodrug PAs and guests, bola&#8208;type SMVs, multifunctional SMVs, glucose&#8208;responsive SMVs for insulin delivery, novel SMVs from responsive PAs, thermo&#8208;responsive SMVs, and ternary SMVs, for chemotherapy, photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, and other biological applications. The future challenges and research directions of PA&#8208;based SMVs are also outlined from the points of views of the fundamental research, biological applications, and clinical applications of PA&#8208;based SMVs.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion Recognition with Sb(III) and Bi(III) Triaryl&#8208;Based Pnictogen Bonding Receptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and characterisation of a library of acyclic Sb(III) and Bi(III) triaryl pnictogen bonding (PnB) receptor systems are reported. In the first&#8208;generation receptor series, quantitative  1  H NMR chloride titration experiments in THF solvent media reveal that halide anion binding potency is intimately correlated with both the electronic&#8208;withdrawing nature of the aryl&#8208; substituent and the polarisability of the PnB donor. Further extensive anion binding investigations with the most potent Sb&#8208; and Bi&#8208;based PnB receptors  :  1&#183;Sb  2CF3  and  1&#183;Bi  2CF3  , reveal novel selectivity profiles, both displaying Cl  &#8208;  selectivity relative to the heavier halides and, impressively, to a range of highly basic oxoanions. The synthesis and preliminary chloride anion binding studies of a series of novel tripodal tris&#8208;proto&#8208;triazole triaryl Sb(III) and Bi(III) mixed PnB&#8208;HB receptor systems are also described. Whereas parent triphenyl Sb(III) and Bi(III) compounds are incapable of binding Cl  &#8208;  in THF solvent media, the PnB&#8208;triazole HB host systems exhibit notable halide affinity</dc:description>

         <title>Improving Photocatalytic Performance through the Construction of a Supramolecular Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A supramolecular organic framework&#8208;type photocatalyst, named TM&#8208;SOF, is constructed by the self&#8208;assembly of cucurbit[8]uril and a tetra&#8208;arm monomer containing four N, N&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl 2,5&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridinium)thiazolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazole (MPT) moieties. Benefiting from the multi&#8208;valent assembly, the photocatalytically active supramolecular MPT dimer, can be stably formed in TM&#8208;SOF. In addition, TM&#8208;SOF exhibits better stability against temperature, substrate, and light irradiation. As a result, the TM&#8208;SOF shows a significantly improved performance for the photocatalytic aerobic oxidation of aryl boronic acid and thioether. It is highly anticipated that this line of research will provide a facile approach for fabricating high&#8208;performance supramolecular photocatalysis systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Directing the Self&#8208;Assembly of Aromatic Foldamer Helices using Acridine Appendages and Metal Coordination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Folded molecules provide complex interaction interfaces amenable to sophisticated self&#8208;assembly motifs. Because of their high conformational stability, aromatic foldamers constitute suitable candidates for the rational elaboration of self&#8208;assembled architectures. Several multiturn helical aromatic oligoamides have been synthesized that possess arrays of acridine appendages pointing in one or two directions. The acridine units were shown to direct self&#8208;assembly in the solid state via aromatic stacking leading to recurrent helix&#8208;helix association patterns under the form of discrete dimers or of extended arrays. In the presence of Pd(II), metal coordination of the acridine units overwhelms other forces and generates new metal&#8208;mediated multihelical self&#8208;assemblies, including macrocyles. These observations demonstrate simple access to different types of foldamer&#8208;containing architectures, ranging from discrete objects to 1D and, by extension, 2D and 3D arrays.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks based Lithium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries (LOBs) are considered as the next&#8208;generation energy technology owing to their high theoretical energy density. However, the sluggish cathode kinetics and degradation of Li anodes result in large voltage hysteresis and low coulombic efficiency. Various materials have been applied to promote the electrochemical performance of LOBs. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) possessing porous structures, open active sites and adjustable pore sizes are attempted as promising materials for catalysts and separators of LOBs. This concept presents an overview of different MOF&#8208;based catalysts for LOBs, including traditional, conductive, semi&#8208;conductive and soluble MOFs, as well as our recently proposed photoinvolved LOBs. Recent advances on the MOF&#8208;based separators have also been discussed to restrain the shuttling of redox mediators between cathodes and anodes and suppress formation of lithium dendrites. Perspectives on the development of MOF&#8208;based LOBs are presented for future research.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular switches have been used as delivery vehicles for various species. The ones that reversibly operate with light are arguably the best candidates for the purpose as they can be operated using light. The two states of these photoswitchable systems often possess remarkable differences in terms of their structural features and electronic properties. Photochromic systems with the appropriate embellishment of functionalities at suitable positions have thus been used as photoresponsive receptors. The use of light&#8208;driven alterations of the structural features has led to differential molecular recognition with these switchable host molecules. In this article, we discuss the use of such supramolecular systems as the delivery vehicles for ions and molecules that started with the pioneering work by Shinkai back in 1979. This review will explicitly cover the development from 2001 to 2022 with some past background and the future prospect of the field</dc:description>

         <title>Unravelling Enzymatic Features in a Supramolecular Iridium Catalyst by Computational Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computational calculations aiming at elucidating the reaction mechanism of a supramolecular iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond borylation enabled the identification of unique intermediates and transition states similar to those found in enzyme catalysis. The unexpected energies associated to the elementary steps are reached thanks to the relevant distortion effects at play, which are upgraded by the molecular&#8208;recognition pocket from the catalyst.







Abstract
Non&#8208;biological catalysts following the governing principles of enzymes are attractive systems to disclose unprecedented reactivities. Most of those existing catalysts feature an adaptable molecular recognition site for substrate binding that are prone to undergo conformational selection pathways. Herein, we present a non&#8208;biological catalyst that is able to bind substrates via the induced fit model according to in&#8208;depth computational calculations. The system, which is constituted by an inflexible substrate&#8208;recognition site derived from a zinc&#8208;porphyrin in the second coordination sphere, features destabilization of ground states as well as stabilization of transition states for the relevant iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond borylation of pyridine. In addition, this catalyst appears to be most suited to tightly bind the transition state rather than the substrate. Besides these features, which are reminiscent of the action modes of enzymes, new elementary catalytic steps (i.&#8201;e. C&#8722;B bond formation and catalyst regeneration) have been disclosed owing to the unique distortions encountered in the different intermediates and transition states.

         <title>High performance Bifunctional Electrocatalysts  Designed  Based on Transition Metal Sulfides for Rechargeable Zn&#8208;air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the energy crisis by the excessive consumption of fossil fuels,   Zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs)  with high theoretical energy density have attracted people's attention.  The overall performance of ZABs is largely determined by the air cathode catalyst  . Therefore, it is necessary to develop high&#8208;efficiency and low&#8208;cost bifunctional catalysts to replace noble metal catalysts to promote the development of ZABs. Among a variety of cathode catalysts, TMS has become a research hotspot in recent years because of its better electrical conductivity than metal phosphides and metal oxides. In this work, we focus on the means of improving the electrocatalytic performance of  transition metal sulfides (TMS)  providing ideas for us to rationally design high&#8208;performance catalysts. Furthermore, the performance improvement law between catalyst performance and ZABs is also discussed in this work. Finally, some challenges and opportunities faced in the research of TMS electrocatalysis are briefly proposed, and strategies for improving the performance of ZABs are prospected.</dc:description>

         <title>Competing C&#8208;4 and C&#8208;5&#8208;Acyl Stabilization of Uronic Acid Glycosyl Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Uronic acids are carbohydrates carrying a terminal carboxylic acid and have a unique reactivity in stereoselective glycosylation reactions. Here, we study the competing intramolecular stabilization of uronic acid cations by the C&#8208;5 carboxylate ester or the C&#8208;4 acetyl group with infrared ion spectroscopy (IRIS). IRIS has revealed that a mixture of bridged ions is formed, where the mixture is driven towards the C&#8208;1,C&#8208;5 dioxolanium ion when the C&#8208;5,C&#8208;2&#8208;relationship is  cis  and towards the formation of the C&#8208;1,C&#8208;4 dioxepanium ion when this relation is  trans  . Isomer population analysis and interconversion barrier computations showed that the two conformations were not in dynamic equilibrium and that the ratio paralleled the density functional theory computed stability of the conformers. These studies reveal how the intrinsic interplay of the different functional groups influences the formation of the different regioisomeric products.</dc:description>

         <title>Capturing a Pentacyclic Fragment&#8208;Based Library Derived from Perophoramidine: Their Design, Synthesis and Evaluation as Anticancer Compounds via DNA Double&#8208;Strand Breaks (DSB) and PARP&#8208;1 Inhibition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we have reported the discovery of a pentacyclic building block comprised of fused indole&#8208;quinoline and piperidinone from the natural product perophoramidine as a formidable anticancer agent. The compounds were synthesized in six steps where the key steps involved a blue LED mediated intramolecular cyclopropanation of the indole intermediates and concomitant reduction of the associated aryl nitro moiety to nitroso in the molecule. Cytotoxicity screening of the compounds against an array of cancer cells  i.e  ., MCF7, HCT116 and A549 demonstrated 0.6 to 9 microM IC  50  s by few of the compounds. gammaH2AX immunofluorescence assay of the two most potent molecules from the phenotypic screening with anti&#8208;g&#8208;H2AX Alexa Fluor 488 antibody revealed extensive DNA damage of the A549 cells which indicated probable PARP inhibition (similar to Perophoramidine). Through molecular docking and molecular dynamic (MD) simulation studies the binding efficiency of our compounds with poly(ADP&#8208;ribose)polymerase 1 (PARP 1) enzyme was determined. Chemiluminescent PARP Assay with Histone&#8208;coated strips indicated that the most active compounds from the phenotypic screening induced PARP&#8208;1 inhibition with IC  50  s of 1.3 to&#160;1.5 microM.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;efficient Ultrathin PdCuMo Porous Nanosheets with Abundant Defects for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To reduce the over&#8208;dependence on Pt, Pd&#8208;based catalysts have become one of the most effective candidates for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In order to further accelerate the ORR kinetics and strengthen the catalytic performance of Pd catalyst, component optimization and morphology design are adopted to achieve these goals. Although great progress has been made, it is still difficult to obtain porous ultrathin nanosheets with excellent performance by a simple method. Here, ultrathin PdCuMo porous nanosheets (PdCuMo NSs) were successfully prepared. This structure possessed a large specific surface area with rich cavities and structural defects, significantly enhancing its ORR performance. In special, the mass activity of PdCuMo NSs was 1.46 A mg  &#8208;1  at 0.90 V, which&#160;was 12.2, &#160; 8.6, 2.7 times as high as that of Pd/C, Pt/C and PdCuMo nanoparticles (PdCuMo NPs), respectively. In addition, it had an excellent ability to resist CO poisoning and exhibited remarkable long&#8208;term stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Temperature Driven Transformation of the Flexible Metal&#8211;Organic Framework DUT&#8208;8(Ni)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;interpenetrated DUT&#8208;8(Ni)_cp MOF transforms upon heating into an interpenetrated ccp phase showing huge thermal effect, suggesting the bond breaking and reformation upon the phase transition. The ccp has the lowest energy among known solvent free DUT&#8208;8(Ni) structures. The ccp and cp phases have similar densities and dispersion energies, but differ in strain energies, pointing on the more relaxed single framework in the ccp phase.







Abstract
DUT&#8208;8(Ni) metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) belongs to the family of flexible pillared layer materials. The desolvated framework can be obtained in the open pore form (op) or in the closed pore form (cp), depending on the crystal size regime. In the present work, we report on the behaviour of desolvated DUT&#8208;8(Ni) at elevated temperatures. For both, op and cp variants, heating causes a structural transition, leading to a new, crystalline compound, containing two interpenetrated networks. The state of the framework before transition (op vs. cp) influences the transition temperature: the small particles of the op phase transform at significantly lower temperature in comparison to the macroparticles of the cp phase, transforming close to the decomposition temperature. The new compound, confined closed pore phase (ccp), was characterized by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and spectroscopic techniques, such as IR, EXAFS, and positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS). Thermal effects of structural transitions were studied using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), showing an overall exothermic effect of the process, involving bond breaking and reformation. Theoretical calculations reveal the energetics, driving the observed temperature induced phase transition.

         <dc:description>
Perfluoroalkoxylation reactions of heteroaromatic compounds, carbon&#8208;carbon multiple bonds, and substitutions at sp3 carbons with CF3O group can be accomplished by several strategies such as thermal radical methods, photocatalysis, electrolysis, electron transfer and redox neutral radical and nucleophilic processes







Abstract
Direct fluoroalkoxylation reactions of (hetero)arenes, carbon&#8208;carbon multiple bonds, and substitution reactions at Csp3 carbon centers by CF3O, CHF2O, and (CF3)2CFO groups are discussed. Emphasis on thermal radical, electron transfer, photocatalytic, electrochemical and redox&#8208;neutral radical methods are placed to accomplish fluoroalkoxylation reactions. All these methods employ either radical fluoroalkoxylating reagents or some nucleophilic trifluoromethoxylating sources of CF3O. A summary of all these methods is provided in Table&#8197;2.

         <title>Hydrocarbon Soluble Alkali&#8208;Metal&#8208;Aluminium Hydride Surrog[ATES]</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Saturated 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidide, TMP, has long played a key role in synthesis, here combined with an unsaturated dihydropyridine unit, 2&#8208;tBuC5H5N, both contribute to the stability of a series of alkali metal aluminate structures by engaging in non&#8208;covalent interactions with alkali metal cations, the extent of which depends on the alkali metal.







Abstract
A series of group&#8197;1 hydrocarbon&#8208;soluble donor free aluminates [AM(tBuDHP)(TMP)Al(iBu)2] (AM=Li, Na, K, Rb) have been synthesised by combining an alkali metal dihydropyridyl unit [(2&#8208;tBuC5H5N)AM)] containing a surrogate hydride (sp3 C&#8722;H) with [(iBu)2Al(TMP)]. These aluminates have been characterised by X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. While the lithium aluminate forms a monomer, the heavier alkali metal aluminates exist as polymeric chains propagated by non&#8208;covalent interactions between the alkali metal cations and the alkyldihydropyridyl units. Solvates [(THF)Li(tBuDHP)(TMP)Al(iBu)2] and [(TMEDA)Na(tBuDHP)(TMP)Al(iBu)2] have also been crystallographically characterised. Theoretical calculations show how the dispersion forces tend to increase on moving from Li to Rb, as opposed to the electrostatic forces of stabilization, which are orders of magnitude more significant. Having unique structural features, these bimetallic compounds can be considered as starting points for exploring unique reactivity trends as alkali&#8208;metal&#8208;aluminium hydride surrog[ATES].

         <title>Proton Conduction at High Temperature in High&#8208;Symmetry Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Molecular Crystals of RuIII Complexes with Six Imidazole&#8211;Imidazolate Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystals of [RuIII(HIm)3(Im)3](1) are one of the rapid proton&#8208;transport materials to work as proton conductors at high temperatures. The proton flow is caused by the strong rotations of Im&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;Im H&#8208;bonding imidazole groups from 200&#8197;K. In the upper left image, as the temperature increases to 400&#8197;K, six coordinated imidazole groups are strongly rotating to transport protons. In the lower right image, whole&#8208;molecule rotations start becoming the main rotation above 400&#8197;K. More information can be found in the Research Article by M.&#8197;Tadokoro et&#8197;al.

         <title>Access to Pyridinyl or Pyridinium Aza&#8208;BODIPYs with Tunable Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescence through ICT from 4&#8208;Pyridinyl Pyrroles
</title>

         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot protocol for the concise and rapid synthesis of 4&#8208;pyridinyl pyrroles involved in in&#8197;situ generated 2H&#8208;azirine was developed. 1/7&#8208;Pyridinyl and pyridinium NIR Aza&#8208;BODIPYs with/without rigidity were further constructed. These pyridinyl Aza&#8208;BOIDIPYs displayed slight bathochromic shifts and maintained bright NIR emission compared with phenyl analogues. Pyridinium Aza&#8208;BODIPYs showed ICT characteristic effect and may be located in lysosome in cells.







Abstract
Aza&#8208;dipyrromethene boron difluoride (Aza&#8208;BODIPY) dyes have attracted much interest in recent decades. In this manuscript, we provide a facile way to access pyridine&#8208;substituted pyrroles. A series of 1/7&#8208;pyridinyl and pyridinium near&#8208;infrared (NIR) Aza&#8208;BODIPYs with/without rigidity were constructed and their spectroscopic properties were extensively investigated. These pyridinyl Aza&#8208;BOIDIPYs displayed slight bathochromic shifts and maintained bright NIR emission. Pyridinium Aza&#8208;BODIPYs showed increased bathochromic shift, however, the molar extinction coefficients and fluorescence quantum yields were decreased owing to ICT effect. The impacts followed the order of pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;ium&gt;pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ium&gt;pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;ium, which was in consistence with their ICT strength. MO calculation was performed to provide possible explanation to the red&#8208;shifted absorption/emission, and apparent charge separation in pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;ium Aza&#8208;BODIPYs. The pyridinium Aza&#8208;BODIPY localized in lysosome and potentially avoided harmful &#8216;&#8216;alkalinizing effects&#8217;&#8217; of traditional lysosome&#8208;targeting fluorescent dyes containing amine moiety. We are working on construction of pyridinyl and pyridinium Aza&#8208;BODIPY photosensitizers against microbials or tumors.

         <title>Solvent Effects on Ultrafast Charge Transfer Population: Insights from the Quantum Dynamics of Guanine&#8208;Cytosine in Chloroform</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We study the ultrafast photoactivated dynamics of the hydrogen bonded dimer Guanine&#8208;Cytosine in chloroform solution, focusing on the population of the Guanine [[EQUATION]] Cytosine charge transfer state (GC&#8208;CT), an important elementary process for the photophysics and photochemistry of nucleic acids. We integrate a quantum dynamics propagation scheme, based on a linear vibronic model parameterized through time dependent density functional theory calculations, with four different solvation models, either implicit or explicit. On average,
after 50 fs, 30 [[EQUATION]] 40% of the bright excited state population
has been transferred to GC&#8208;CT. This process is thus fast and effective, especially when transferring from the Guanine bright excited states, in line with the available experimental studies. Independent of the adopted solvation model, the population of GC&#8208;CT is however disfavored in solution with respect to the gas phase. We show that dynamical solvation effects are responsible for this puzzling result and assess the different chemical&#8208;physical effects modulating the population of CT states on the ultrafast time&#8208;scale.

We integrate a quantum dynamics propagation scheme, based on a linear vibronic model parameterized through time dependent density functional theory calculations, with four different solvation models, either implicit or explicit. On average,
after 50 fs, 30 [[EQUATION]] 40% of the bright excited state population
has been transferred to GC-CT. This process is thus fast and effective, especially when transferring from the Guanine bright excited states, in line with the available experimental studies. Independent of the adopted solvation model, the population of GC-CT is however disfavored in solution with respect to the gas phase. We show that dynamical solvation effects are responsible for this puzzling result and assess the different chemical-physical effects modulating the population of CT states on the ultrafast time-scale. We also propose some simple analyses to predict how solvent can affect the population transfer between bright and CT states, showing that effect of the solute/solvent electrostatic interactions on the energy of the CT state can provide a rather reliable indication of its possible population.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Proteophenes &#8208; amino acid functionalized thiophene&#8208;based fluorescent ligands for visualization of protein deposits in tissue sections with Alzheimer&#180;s disease pathology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein deposits composed of specific proteins or peptides are associated with several neurodegenerative diseases and fluorescent ligands able to detect these pathological hallmarks are vital. Here, we report the synthesis of a class of thiophene&#8208;based ligands, denoted proteophenes, with different amino acid side&#8208;chain functionalities along the conjugated backbone, which display selectivity towards specific disease&#8208;associated protein aggregates in tissue sections with Alzheimer&#180;s disease (AD) pathology. The selectivity of the ligands towards AD associated pathological hallmarks, such as aggregates of the amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptide or tau filamentous inclusions, was highly dependent on the chemical nature of the amino acid functionality, as well as on the location of the functionality along the pentameric thiophene backbone. Finally, the concept of synthesizing donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor proteophenes with distinct photophysical properties was shown. Our findings provide the structural and functional basis for the development of new thiophene&#8208;based ligands that can be utilized for optical assignment of different aggregated proteinaceous species in tissue sections.</dc:description>

         <title>Reaction of Pertechnetate in Highly Alkaline Solution: Synthesis and Characterization of the Nitridotrioxotechnetate Ba[TcO3N]</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The preparation of novel technetium oxides, their characterization and the general investigation of technetium chemistry are of significant importance, since fundamental research has so far mainly focused on the group homologues. Whereas the structure chemistry of technetium in strongly oxidizing media is dominated by the&#160;[TcO4]&#8208; anion, our recent investigation yielded the new [TcO3N]2&#8208; anion. Brown single crystals of Ba[TcO  3  N] were obtained under hydrothermal conditions starting from Ba(OH)  2  &#183;  8H  2  O and NH  4  [TcO  4  ] at 200 &#176;C. Ba[TcO3N] crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system with the space group  P  2  1  /  n  (  a  = 7.2159(4) &#197;,  b  = 7.8536(5) &#197;,  c  = 7.4931(4) &#197; and  &#946;  = 104.279(2)&#176;). The crystal structure of Ba[TcO3N] consists of isolated [TcO3N]2&#8208; tetrahedra, which are surrounded by Ba  2+  cations. XANES measurements complement the oxidation state +VII for technetium. Raman spectroscopic experiments on Ba[TcO  3  N] single crystals exhibit characteristic Tc&#8208;O and Tc&#8208;N vibrational modes.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unexplored &#8216;actor&#8217; behavior of redox&#8208;active bis(aldimine) congener, p&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bis(picoline)aldimine   (L1),   towards dioxygen activation and subsequent functionalization of its backbone was demonstrated on coordination with {Ru(acac)  2  } (acac=   acetylacetonate). Reaction under aerobic condition led to   the one&#8208;pot generation of dinuclear complexes with unperturbed L1, imino&#8208;   carbox   amido (   L2    &#8208;    ) and bis(   carbox   amido)   (L3  2    &#8208;    )   bridged isovalent  {   Ru  II  (&#181;&#8208;   L   1   )Ru  II   },    1/    {   Ru  I    I     I    (&#181;&#8208;   L   3    2     &#8208;    )Ru  I    I     I    },    3    and   mixed&#8208;valent {   Ru  II  (&#181;&#8208;   L   2    &#8208;    )Ru  I    I     I    },  2  .

         <title>Vibrational Circular Dichroism Unravels Supramolecular Chirality and Hydration Polymorphism of Nucleoside Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectroscopy has been widely used to study (bio)molecules in solution. However, its solid&#8208;state applications have been restricted due to experimental limitations and artifacts. Having overcome some of them, we now present the first VCD study of nucleoside crystals. A two&#8208;orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude enhancement of VCD signal was observed due to high molecular order in the crystals, and resulting supramolecular chirality. This allowed us to obtain high&#8208;quality VCD spectra within minutes using minute amounts of samples. We show that VCD technique is extremely sensitive in detecting changes in a crystal order, and able to distinguish different hydration states of crystals. This elevates it to a new level, as a fast and efficient tool to study chiral crystalline samples. We demonstrate that VCD is capable of near&#8208;instantaneous detection of hydration polymorphs and crystal degradation, which is of substantial interest in pharmaceutical industry (quality and stability control).</dc:description>

The efficiency of photocatalytic overall water splitting reactions is usually limited by the high energy barrier and complex multiple electron&#8208;transfer processes of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Although bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) as the photocatalyst has been developed for enhancing the kinetics of the water oxidation reaction, it still suffers from challenges of fast recombination of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs and poor photocatalytic activity. Herein, six MII&#8208;CoIII Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) (M=Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn) cocatalysts are synthesized and deposited on the surface of BiVO4 for boosting the surface catalytic efficiency and enhancing photogenerated carries separation efficiency of BiVO4. Six MII&#8208;CoIII PBAs@BiVO4 photocatalysts all demonstrate increased photocatalytic water oxidation performance compared to that of BiVO4 alone. Among them, the Co&#8722;Co PBA@BiVO4 photocatalyst is employed as a representative research object and is thoroughly characterized by electrochemistry, electronic microscope as well as multiple spectroscopic analyses. Notably, BiVO4 coupling with Co&#8722;Co PBA cocatalyst could capture more photons than that of pure BiVO4, facilitating the transfer of photogenerated charge carriers between BiVO4 and Co&#8722;Co PBA as well as the surface catalytic efficiency of BiVO4. Overall, this work would promote the synthesis strategy development for exploring new types of composite photocatalysts for water oxidation.

         <title>Pseudo&#8208;Octahedral Iron(II) Complexes with Near&#8208;Degenerate Charge Transfer and Ligand Field States at the Franck&#8208;Condon Geometry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron(II) complexes with 6,2&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;carboxypyridyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;methylamine&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;pyridine ligands possess low&#8208;energy 1MLCT states. 3MLCT and 3/5MC excited states are nearly degenerate at the Franck&#8208;Condon geometry. Expansion of the coordination sphere lowers the 3/5MC energies shortening the 3MLCT lifetime. Cooling and solvent reorganization occurs within 33&#8197;ps to give the relaxed 5MC state with ca. 0.5&#8197;ns lifetime.







Abstract
Increasing the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT) excited state lifetime of polypyridine iron(II) complexes can be achieved by lowering the ligand's &#960;* orbital energy and by increasing the ligand field splitting. In the homo&#8208; and heteroleptic complexes [Fe(cpmp)2]2+ (12+) and [Fe(cpmp)(ddpd)]2+ (22+) with the tridentate ligands 6,2&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;carboxypyridyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;methylamine&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;pyridine (cpmp) and N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;N,N&#8217;&#8208;di&#8208;pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ylpyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diamine (ddpd) two or one dipyridyl ketone moieties provide low energy &#960;* acceptor orbitals. A good metal&#8208;ligand orbital overlap to increase the ligand field splitting is achieved by optimizing the octahedricity through CO and NMe units between the coordinating pyridines which enable the formation of six&#8208;membered chelate rings. The push&#8208;pull ligand cpmp provides intra&#8208;ligand and ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (ILCT, LL'CT) excited states in addition to MLCT excited states. Ground and excited state properties of 12+ and 22+ were accessed by X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses, resonance Raman spectroscopy, (spectro)electrochemistry, EPR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy, static and time&#8208;resolved IR and UV/Vis/NIR absorption spectroscopy as well as quantum chemical calculations.

         <title>Isolation of Elusive Phosphinidene&#8208;Chlorotetrylenes: The Heavier Cyanogen Chloride Analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elusive hetero&#8208;bileptic carbenes&#8208;stabilized singlet phosphinidiene&#8208;chlorosilylene, and chlorogermylenes with majorly contributing covalent electron&#8208;sharing &#963; bonds are isolated and structurally characterized in the solid state.







Abstract
The elusive phosphinidene&#8208;chlorotetrylenes, [PGeCl] and [PSiCl] have been stabilized by the hetero&#8208;bileptic cyclic alkyl(amino) carbene (cAAC), N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands, and isolated in the solid state at room temperature as the first neutral monomeric species of this class with the general formulae (L)P&#8208;ECl(L&#8242;) (E=Ge, 3&#8201;a&#8211;3&#8201;c; E=Si, 6; L=cAAC; L&#8242;=NHC). Compounds 3&#8201;a&#8211;3&#8201;c have been synthesized by the reaction of cAAC&#8208;supported potassium phosphinidenides [cAAC=PK(THF)x]n (1&#8201;a&#8211;1&#8201;c) with the adduct NHC:&#8594;GeCl2 (2). Similarly, compound 6 has been synthesized via reaction of 1&#8201;a with NHC:&#8594;SiCl2 adduct (4). Compounds 3&#8201;a&#8211;3&#8201;c, and 6 have been structurally characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometric analysis. DFT calculations revealed that the heteroatom P in 3 bears two lone pairs; the non&#8208;bonding pair with 67.8&#8201;% of s&#8208; and 32&#8201;% of p character, whereas the other lone pair is involved in &#960; backdonation to the CcAAC&#8208;N &#960;* of cAAC. The Ge atom in 3 contains a lone pair with 80&#8201;% of s character, and slightly involved in the &#960; backdonation to CNHC. EDA&#8208;NOCV analyses showed that two charged doublet fragments {(cAAC)(NHC)}+, and {PGeCl}&#8722; prefer to form one covalent electron&#8208;sharing &#963; bond, one dative &#963; bond, one dative &#960; bond, and a charge polarized weak &#960; bond. The covalent electron&#8208;sharing &#963; bond contributes to the major stabilization energy to the total orbital interaction energy of 3, enabling the first successful isolations of this class of compounds (3, 6) in the laboratory.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of High&#8208;Strained Metal Vinylidene and Metal Carbyne</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cyclic metal vinylidene with high ring&#8208;strain was obtained via a one&#8208;pot synthesis. The reactivity of this metal vinylidene with nucleophiles and electrophiles was investigated, resulting in unprecedented conversion of the metal vinylidene to a metal carbyne in five&#8208;membered ring.







Abstract
A novel one&#8208;pot reaction producing a metal vinylidene structure in a five&#8208;membered ring by cyclization of a multiyne has been achieved. The ring strain and the high stability of the cyclic metal vinylidene complexes have been analyzed experimentally and computationally. The metal vinylidene unit in a fused&#8208;ring complex is unreactive to both nucleophiles and electrophiles. It reacts however at the nearby carbonyl group achieving the unprecedented conversion of metal tributing factors for the aromaticity&#8208;driven process has been studied by DFT calculations.

         <title>Development of an Enantioselective Allylic Alkylation of Acyclic &#945;&#8208;Fluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketoesters for Asymmetric Synthesis of 3&#8208;Fluoropiperidines</title>

Get into Gear: The Trost ligand series promotes the enantioselective allylation of &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketoesters to generate 3&#8208;fluoropiperidines in up to 92&#8201;%&#8197;ee. We have employed the Lloyd&#8208;Jones Norrby model to explain the origins of enantiocontrol and propose that the catalyst backbone engenders a gearing effect whereby the ester adopts an s&#8208;trans conformation that enforces the alkene moiety of the enoate to adopt an s&#8208;cis orientation, thereby controlling facial to the &#960;&#8208;allyl complex.







Abstract
The first useful enantioselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation of &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketoesters has been achieved using the Trost family of chiral ligands yielding products in up to 92&#8201;%&#8197;ee. This work provides new insights regarding the typically modest selectivities associated with acyclic &#945;&#8208;fluoroenolates and shows experimental evidence that the typically poor levels of enantiocontrol associated with these systems are not necessarily due to the presence of E/Z enolate mixtures. Finally, this methodology allows the easy preparation of useful 3&#8208;fluoropiperidine intermediates, and it is demonstrated that these systems are applicable to a range of functionalization reactions leading to new building blocks for the discovery of bioactive products.

         <title>Biohybrid Organic Heterostructure Based on Chlorophyll&#8208;Bacteriochlorophyll Aggregates for Ecofriendly Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the present work, BChl&#8722;Chl&#8208;based organic heterojunction structures were introduced for visible light&#8208;driven photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production. At the same time, a novel BChl&#8722;Chl&#8208;based organic heterojunction noble metal&#8208;free BChl@Chl@Ti3C2Tx photocatalyst was successfully constructed by a simple alternating deposition process of Chl and BChl on Ti3C2Tx nanosheets.







Abstract
Hydrogen energy is an abundant, clean, sustainable and environmentally friendly renewable energy source. Therefore, the production of hydrogen by photocatalytically splitting water on semiconductors has been considered in recent years as a promising and sustainable strategy for converting solar energy into chemical energy to replace conventional energy sources and to solve the growing problem of environmental pollution and the global energy crisis. However, highly efficient solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen production remains a huge challenge due to the poor visible light response of available photocatalytic materials and the low efficiency of separation and transfer of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs. In the present work, organic heterojunction structures based on bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) and chlorophyll (Chl) molecules were introduced and used for solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen production from water under visible light. Also, noble metal&#8208;free photocatalyst was successfully constructed on Ti3C2Tx nanosheets by simple successive deposition of Chl and BChl, which was used for the photocatalytic splitting water to hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The results show that the optimal BChl@Chl@Ti3C2Tx composite has a high HER performance with 114&#8197;&#956;mol/h/gcat, which is much higher than the BChl@Ti3C2Tx and Chl@Ti3C2Tx composites.

         <title>Current State of [Fe]&#8208;Hydrogenase and Its Biomimetic Models</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

[Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase can heterolytically cleave H2 and transfer the resulting hydride to an unsaturated substrate. Fruitful results have been achieved from studies on enzyme function, structure, catalytic mechanism, cofactor biosynthesis, biomimetic model development and artificial enzyme construction. But application scenarios of this enzyme are still in absence.







Abstract
[Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase, the third type of natural hydrogenase, is capable to heterolytically activate hydrogen molecule and transfer the resulting hydride to an unsaturated substrate, making it a promising hydrogenation catalyst. Over the last three decades, fruitful results on this enzyme have been achieved. In this review, we have summarized the major progresses about this enzyme including its structural characterisation, catalytic mechanism, cofactor biosynthesis, mimetic model development as well as artificial enzymes construction. In the meanwhile, challenges and opportunities of this enzyme and its mimetic systems in the application of synthetic chemistry and others are discussed.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;up Synthesis of Water&#8208;Soluble Gold Nanoparticles Stabilized by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes: From Structural Characterization to Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small water&#8208;soluble N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;stabilized gold nanoparticles (NHC@AuNPs) were synthesized via the bottom&#8208;up approach and showed suitability for applications in catalysis and biomedicine.







Abstract
N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have become attractive ligands for functionalizing gold nanoparticle surfaces with applications ranging from catalysis to biomedicine. Despite their great potential, NHC stabilized gold colloids (NHC@AuNPs) are still scarcely explored and further efforts should be conducted to improve their design and functionalization. Here, the &#8216;bottom&#8208;up&#8217; synthesis of two water&#8208;soluble gold nanoparticles (AuNP&#8208;1 and AuNP&#8208;2) stabilized by hydrophilic mono&#8208; and bidentate NHC ligands is reported together with their characterization by various spectroscopic and analytical methods. The NPs showed key differences likely to be due to the selected NHC ligand systems. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed small quasi&#8208;spherical and faceted NHC@AuNPs of similar particle size (ca. 2.3&#8211;2.6&#8197;nm) and narrow particle size distribution, but the colloids featured different ratios of Au(I)/Au(0) by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Furthermore, the NHC@AuNPs were supported on titania and fully characterized. The new NPs were studied for their catalytic activity towards the reduction of nitrophenol substrates, the reduction of resazurin and for their photothermal efficiency. Initial results on their application in photothermal therapy (PTT) were obtained in human cancer cells in&#8197;vitro. The aforementioned reactions represent important model reactions towards wastewater remediation, bioorthogonal transformations and cancer treatment.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have become attractive ligands for functionalizing gold nanoparticle surfaces with applications ranging from catalysis to biomedicine. Despite their great potential, NHC stabilized gold colloids (NHC@AuNPs) are still scarcely explored and further efforts should be conducted to improve their design and functionalization. Here, the &#8216;bottom-up&#8217; synthesis of two water-soluble gold nanoparticles (&lt;b&gt;AuNP-1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;AuNP-2&lt;/b&gt;) stabilized by hydrophilic mono- and bidentate NHC ligands is reported together with their characterization by various spectroscopic and analytical methods. The NPs showed key differences likely to be due to the selected NHC ligand systems. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed small &lt;i&gt;quasi&lt;/i&gt;-spherical and faceted NHC@AuNPs of similar particle size (ca. 2.3&#8211;2.6&#8197;nm) and narrow particle size distribution, but the colloids featured different ratios of Au(I)/Au(0) by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Furthermore, the NHC@AuNPs were supported on titania and fully characterized. The new NPs were studied for their catalytic activity towards the reduction of nitrophenol substrates, the reduction of resazurin and for their photothermal efficiency. Initial results on their application in photothermal therapy (PTT) were obtained in human cancer cells in&#8197;vitro. The aforementioned reactions represent important model reactions towards wastewater remediation, bioorthogonal transformations and cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Insights of Non&#8208;fused Ring Acceptors for High&#8208;Performance Non&#8208;fullerene Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this concept, the recently representative progress of non&#8208;fused ring electron acceptors (NFRAs) for organic solar cells is highlighted by focusing on introducing the newly developed molecular design strategies and discussing the structure&#8208;performance relationships. A perspective on the future design of high&#8208;performance NFRAs is also discussed.







Abstract
Non&#8208;fullerene acceptors with fused&#8208;ring structures have rapidly improved the performance of organic solar cells over the past five years, but they still suffer from synthetic complexity and thus high material costs, one of the major obstacles of hindering their commercialization process. The construction of non&#8208;fused ring acceptors (NFRAs) has recently been regarded as a feasible solution due to their facile synthesis and satisfactory device performances. Thus in this concept, we highlight the important progress of NFRAs in recent years, and discuss the key relationship between molecular design strategies and device performance. Finally, we provide some potential molecular insights for the future design of high&#8208;performance NFRAs.

         <dc:description>
Heterometallic supramolecular tetrahedra can be prepared by self&#8208;assembly of lanthanide ions with ligand L followed by crystallization. Upon ether diffusion with a mixture of [Eu2L3] and [Gd2L3] helicates, a mixture of heterometallic EunGd&#8217;4&#8208;n(L6) (n=0&#8211;4) tetrahedra was prepared. Ligand L demonstrated preferential formation of heterometallic tetrahedron which is confirmed by MS deconvolution.







Abstract
Construction of lanthanide heterometallic complex is important for engineering multifunction molecular containers. However, it remains a challenge because of the similar ionic radii of lanthanides. Herein we attempt to prepare chiral lanthanide heterometallic tetrahedra. Upon crystallization with a mixture of [Eu2L3] and [Ln2L3] (Ln=Gd, Tb and Dy) helicates, a mixture of heterometallic EunLn&#8217;4&#8208;n(L6) (n=0&#8211;4) tetrahedra was prepared. Selective formation of heterometallic tetrahedron was observed as MS deconvolution results deviated from statistical results. The formation of heterometallic tetrahedron was found to be sensitive to ionic radii as well as the ratio of the two helicates used in the crystallization.

         <dc:description>During the past two decades, single&#8208;atom&#8208;centered medium&#8208;sized germanium clusters [M@Ge  n  ] (M = transition metals, n&gt;12) have been extensively explored, both from theoretical perspectives and experimental gas&#8208;phase syntheses. However, the actual structural arrangements of the Ge  13  and Ge  14  endohedral cages are still ambiguous and has long remained an unresolved problem for experimental implementation. In this work, we successfully synthesize 13&#8208;/14&#8208;vertex Ge clusters [Nb@Ge  13  ]  3&#8722;  (  1  ) and [Nb@Ge  14  ]  3&#8722;  (  2  ), which are structurally characterized and exhibit unprecedented topologies, neither classical deltahedra nor 3&#8208;connected polyhedral structures. Theoretical analysis indicates that the major stabilization of the Ge backbones arises due to the substantial interaction of Ge 4  p  &#8208;AOs with the endohedral Nb 4  d  &#8208;AOs through three/four&#8208;center two&#8208;electron bonds with an enhanced electron density accumulated over the shortest Nb&#8208;Ge13 contact in  1  . Low occupancies of the direct two&#8208;center two&#8208;electron (2c&#8208;2e) Nb&#8208;Ge and Ge&#8208;Ge &#963; bonds point to a considerable degree of electron delocalization over the Ge cages revealing their electron deficiency.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of high&#8208;power solid&#8208;state lasers is in urgent need of infrared (IR) nonlinear optical (NLO) materials with wide band gaps and high laser&#8208;induced damage thresholds (LIDTs). Herein, a new compressed chalcopyrite&#8208;like IR NLO crystal (Na  0.74  Ag  1.26  )BaSnS  4  was successfully synthesized using a facile high&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state method. Its structure can be considered as a variant of chalcopyrite AgGaS  2  (AGS)&#8208;type ones. It features a three&#8208;dimensional (3  D  ) framework constructed by corner&#8208;sharing {[(Na/Ag)S  4  ]  7  &#8211;  }  &#8734;  layers and isolated SnS  4  tetrahedra with negative cavities occupied by counter ion Ba  2+  . (Na  0.74  Ag  1.26  )BaSnS  4  exhibits phase&#8208;matchable moderate SHG response (0.31 &#215; AGS), wide band gap (3.70 eV), and high LIDT (6.44 &#215; AGS). The theoretical calculations reveal that the NLO response of (Na  0.74  Ag  1.26  )BaSnS  4  is mainly originated from the synergetic effects of AgS  4  and SnS  4  tetrahedra, and the inclusion of alkaline and alkaline earth metals are responsible for the wide band gap and high LIDT. Moreover, the discovery of chalcopyrite&#8208;like compound will provide a feasible design strategy for the exploration of new promising IR NLO materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Discriminating Chiral Supramolecular Motions by Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular motions are closely associated with the behaviors and properties of organic materials. However, monitoring molecular motions is challenging. Herein, a chiral supramolecular system consisting of L&#8208;/D&#8208;phenylalanine (LPF/DPF) as a chiral inducer and an achiral tetraphenylethene derivative (TPEF) as a molecular rotor has been proposed and explored for real&#8208;time discriminating the supramolecular motions by the visualization of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signal variations.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Molecular motions are closely associated with the behaviors and properties of organic materials. However, monitoring molecular motions is challenging. Herein, a chiral supramolecular system consisting of L-/D-phenylalanine (LPF/DPF) as a chiral inducer and an achiral tetraphenylethene derivative (TPEF) as a molecular rotor has been proposed and explored for real-time discriminating the supramolecular motions by the visualization of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signal variations. Derived from the ordered molecular motions of TPEF induced by LPF/DPF, highly organized aggregates have been progressively assembled in a controlled manner with differentiated morphologies, including spherical particles, one-dimensional fibers, and floor-shaped supercrystals. Notably, increasing level of ordered aggregates, in turn, led to quenching emissions, while the CPL signals have been dramatically amplified accompanying by a sharp enhancement of luminescence dissymmetry factors (glum) from nearly 0 to -0.1. The significant amplification of CPL is attributed to the ordered aggregates of supramolecules, leading to the decrease of electric transition dipole moments in supramolecular system. As a result of the chiral supramolecular motions powered by supramolecular crystallization, the supramolecular motions are conveniently discriminated by visual CPL signal variation with an enhancement of glum value from 0 to -0.1 in real time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cationic Gold(II) Complexes: Experimental and Theoretical Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold(II) complexes are rare and their application for catalysis of chemical transformations is underexplored. The reason is their easy oxidation or reduction to the more stable gold(III) or gold(I) complexes, respectively. We explored the thermodynamics of the formation of the [(L)Au  II  X]  +  complexes (L = ligand, X = halogen) from their gold(III) precursors and investigated the stability and the spectral properties in the IR and VIS range of the formed gold(II) complexes in the gas phase. The results show that the best ancillary ligands L for stabilizing gaseous [(L)Au  II  X]  +  complexes are bidentate and tridentate ligands with nitrogen donor atoms. The electronic structure and spectral properties of the investigated gold(II) complexes were correlated with the quantum chemical calculations. The results show that the molecular and electronic structure of the gold(II) complexes as well as their spectroscopic properties are very similar to the analogous stable copper(II) complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Vicinal Diol Approach for the Total Synthesis of Molestin E, ent&#8208;Sinulacembranolide A and ent&#8208;Sinumaximol A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work an approach for the synthesis of furanocembranoid natural products containing the C&#8208;7,8&#8208;diol moiety is disclosed. This culminated in the first total synthesis of the natural product molestin E, together with  ent  &#8208;sinulacembranolide A and  ent  &#8208;sinumaximol A as well as a thorough exploration of their chemistry. Late&#8208;stage ring&#8208;closure of the C&#8208;7,8&#8208;diols to the corresponding epoxides was also demonstrated. Key features of this synthetic strategy include a stereoselective Baylis&#8208;Hillman reaction, ring&#8208;closing metathesis and Shiina macrolactonisation.  Chiral&#8208;pool materials were deployed to ensure the desired absolute stereochemistry which was confirmed by late&#8208;stage single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.</dc:description>

         <title>YfeX &#8211; A New Platform for Carbene Transferase Development with High Intrinsic Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbene transfer biocatalysis has evolved from basic science to an area with vast potential for the development of new industrial processes. In this study, we show that YfeX, naturally a peroxidase, has great potential for the development of new carbene transferases, due to its high intrinsic reactivity, especially for the N&#8208;H insertion reaction of aromatic and aliphatic primary and secondary amines. YfeX shows high stability against organic solvents (methanol and DMSO), greatly improving turnover of hydrophobic substrates. Interestingly, in styrene cyclopropanation, WT YfeX naturally shows high enantioselectivity, generating the trans product with 87% selectivity for the (R,R) enantiomer. WT YfeX also catalyzes the Si&#8212;H insertion efficiently. Steric effects in the active site were further explored using the R232A variant. Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM) calculations reveal details on the mechanism of Si&#8212;H insertion. YfeX, and potentially other peroxidases, are exciting new targets for the development of improved carbene transferases.</dc:description>

         <title>Microscopic Reactivity of Phenylferrate Ions toward Organyl Halides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite its practical importance, organoiron chemistry remains poorly understood due to its mechanistic complexity. Here, we focus on the oxidative addition of organyl halides to phenylferrate anions in the gas phase. By mass&#8208;selecting individual phenylferrate anions, we can determine the effect of the oxidation state, the ligation, and the nuclearity of the iron complex on its reactions with a series of organyl halides RX. We find that Ph  2  Fe(I)  &#8722;  and other low&#8208;valent ferrates are more reactive than Ph  3  Fe(II)  &#8722;  ; Ph  4  Fe(III)  &#8722;  is inert. The coordination of a PPh  3  ligand or the presence of a second iron center lower the reactivity. Besides direct cross&#8208;coupling reactions resulting in the formation of RPh, we also observe the abstraction of halogen atoms. This reaction channel shows the readiness of organoiron species to undergo radical&#8208;type processes. Complementary DFT calculations afford further insight and rationalize the high reactivity of the Ph  2  Fe(I)  &#8722;  complex by the exothermicity of the oxidative addition and the low barriers associated with this reaction step. At the same time, they point to the importance of changes of the spin state in the reactions of Ph  3  Fe(II)  &#8722;  .</dc:description>

The study showcased that while &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;chlorohydroxamate could be activated by a combination of base and 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP) into the corresponding azaoxyallyl cations, it could further emerge into a &#960;&#8208;extended species involving the adjacent &#945;&#8208;aryl moiety, and this transition is contingent on electronic effects of the aromatic ring as well as on &#945;&#8208;substituents. An effective activation of the &#945;&#8208;aromatic ring could pave the path for intramolecular Ar(Csp2)&#8208;N bond formation towards oxindoles. Control experiments and DFT calculations suggested that a non&#8208;pericyclic nucleophilic amination pathway is most likely operative and precluded the possibility of concerted or electrophilic amination mechanism.

         <title>Meso&#8208;Carbon Atom Nucleophilic Attack Susceptibility in the Sterically Strained Antiaromatic Bis&#8208;BODIPY Macrocycle and Extended Electron&#8208;Deficient BODIPY Precursor
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sterically strained and non&#8208;fluorescent antiaromatic macrocycle which has two BODIPY subunits linked by p&#8208;divinylphenyl bridges has been prepared and characterized by a variety of spectroscopic and theoretical methods. It has an unusual susceptibility to the nucleophilic attack at the meso&#8208;carbon atom.







Abstract
A sterically strained 32&#960;&#8208;electron antiaromatic bis&#8208;BODIPY macrocycle in which two BODIPY fragments are linked by p&#8208;divinylbenzene groups was prepared and characterized. Unlike regular BODIPYs, the fluorescence in this macrocycle is quenched. The broad signals in the NMR spectra of the macrocycle were explained by the vibronic freedom of the p&#8208;divinylbenzene fragments.

     alt="Meso-Carbon Atom Nucleophilic Attack Susceptibility in the Sterically Strained Antiaromatic Bis-BODIPY Macrocycle and Extended Electron-Deficient BODIPY Precursor**&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A sterically strained and non-fluorescent antiaromatic macrocycle&lt;/b&gt; which has two BODIPY subunits linked by &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-divinylphenyl bridges has been prepared and characterized by a variety of spectroscopic and theoretical methods. It has an unusual susceptibility to the nucleophilic attack at the meso-carbon atom.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sterically strained 32&#960;-electron antiaromatic bis-BODIPY macrocycle in which two BODIPY fragments are linked by &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-divinylbenzene groups was prepared and characterized. Unlike regular BODIPYs, the fluorescence in this macrocycle is quenched. The broad signals in the NMR spectra of the macrocycle were explained by the vibronic freedom of the &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-divinylbenzene fragments. The possible diradicaloid nature of the macrocycle was excluded on the basis of variable-temperature EPR spectra in solution and in solid state, which is indicative of its closed-shell quinoidal structure. The &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-C&#8722;H bond in the macrocycle and its precursor BODIPY dialdehyde &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; forms a weak hydrogen bond with THF and is susceptible for the nucleophilic attack by organic amines and cyanide anion. The reaction products of such a nucleophilic attack have &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; carbon atoms and were characterized by NMR, mass spectrometry and, in one case, X-ray crystallography. Unlike the initial bis-BODIPY macrocycle, the adducts have strong fluorescence in the 400&#8197;nm region. The electronic structure and spectroscopic properties of new chromophores were probed by density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations and correlate well with the experimental data.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Elucidating the nature of the external acid sites of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites using NMR probe molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The identification of acid and nonacid species at the external surface of zeolites remains a major challenge, in contrast with the much&#8208;studied internal acid sites. Here, we show that the synthesis of zeolite ZSM&#8208;5 samples with distinct particle sizes, combined with solid&#8208;state NMR and computational studies of trimethylphosphine oxide (TMPO) adsorption, provides insight into the chemical species on the external surface of the zeolite crystals.&#160;  1  H&#8208;  31  P HETCOR NMR spectra of TMPO&#8208;loaded zeolites exhibit a broad correlation peak at &#948;  P  &#160;~ 35 &#8208; 55 ppm and &#948;  H  &#160;~ 5 &#8208; 12 ppm assigned to external SiOH species. Pore&#8208;mouth Br&#248;nsted acid sites exhibit&#160;  31  P and&#160;  1  H NMR resonances and adsorption energies close to those reported for internal acid sites interacting with TMPO. The presence of an external tricoordinate Al&#8208;Lewis site interacting strongly with TMPO is suggested, resulting in&#160;  31  P resonances that overlap with the peaks usually ascribed to the interaction of TMPO with Br&#248;nsted sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Arylfluorination of Alkenes: a Highlight on a Powerful New Method for the Access of Organofluorine Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorine incorporation into organic molecules is often beneficial to absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties or bioactivity. As a consequence, organofluorine compounds have become quite common amongst drugs and agrochemicals, and their preparation is a highly important topic in both synthetic organic chemistry and pharmaceutical chemistry. One of the newly developed methods for the access of organofluorine compounds is Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylfluorination. It is an olefin difunctionalization process, which simultaneously introduces an aryl group and a fluorine atom into an alkene framework. This highlight provides a concise overview of this powerful and versatile method.</dc:description>

         <title>Free Aluminylenes: An Emerging Class of Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aluminylenes (R&#8211;Al) are aluminium analogs of carbenes. In contrast to isolable carbenes, aluminylenes are extremely rare species. In the past years, pioneered by Schn&#246;ckel, Roesky and Power, a few free aluminylenes and their complexes have been reported. Such compounds have the aluminium atom in the oxidation state +I, which contrasts with classical organoaluminium derivatives that contain the element in the +III oxidation state. Aluminylenes, either in their free state or in the coordination sphere of a Lewis base, are capable of coordinating to transition metals and activating inert chemical bonds. Free aluminylenes are emerging as potent synthetic platforms for unusual aluminium species.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantiospecific syntheses of congested atropisomers through chiral (bis)aryne synthetic equivalents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthetic equivalents of the enantiopure binaphthyl bis(aryne) atropisomers derived from BINOL featuring a stereogenic axis vicinal to the two reactive triple bonds can be generated for the first time in solution in an enantiospecific manner. Using a two&#8208;step sequence based on the bidirectional [4 + 2] cycloaddition of furan derivatives followed by an aromatizative deoxygenation reaction, several 9,9&#8217;&#8208;bianthracenyl&#8208;based atropisomers could be prepared enantiospecifically in high enantiomeric purity. Alternatively, bidirectional reactions with anthracene, 2&#8208;bromostyrene, and perylene as the arynophiles afforded very congested bis(benzotriptycene), bis(tetraphene) and bis(anthra[1,2,3,4&#8208;  ghi  ]perylene) nanocarbon atropisomers in equally high enantiomeric purity. In complement, cross reactions with two different arynophiles revealed possible. The unusual atropisomer prototypes described in this study open the way to enantiopure polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon atropisomers designed for functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Fusion of Aza&#8208; and Oxadiborepins with Furans via a Reversible Ring Opening Process Furnishes Versatile Building Blocks for Extended &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A modular synthesis of both difurooxa&#8208; and difuroazadiborepins via a common precursor is demonstrated. Starting from 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bifuran, after protection of the positions 5 and 5&#8217; with bulky silyl groups, the formation of the novel polycycles proceeds through opening of the furan rings to a dialkyne and subsequent re&#8208;cyclization in the borylation step. The resulting difuran&#8208;fused diborepins show pronounced stability, highly planar tricyclic structures, and intense blue light emission. Deprotection and transformation into dibrominated building blocks that can be incorporated in &#960;&#8208;extended materials can be performed in one step. Detailed DFT calculations provide information about the aromaticity of the constituent rings of this polycycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioinspired Photocatalytic NADH Regeneration by Covalently Metalated Carbon Nitride for Enhanced CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial photosystem was constructed through the covalent attachment of Rh complex onto PCN. The integrated photocatalyst could regenerate NADH efficiently by integrating the light harvesting unit and the electron transfer unit through conjugated connection. By further coupling with FDH immobilized on the hydrophobic membrane, an enhanced HCOOH production could be obtained.







Abstract
Natural photosynthesis is a highly unified biocatalytic system, which coupled cofactor (NAD(P)H) regeneration and enzymatic CO2 reduction efficiently for solar energy conversion. Mimicking nature, a novel system with Rh complex covalently grafted onto NH2&#8208;functionalized polymeric carbon nitride (NH2&#8208;PCN) was constructed. The integrated connection of the light&#8208;harvesting and electron mediation modules as Rhm3&#8208;N&#8208;PCN could promote the efficient NAD+ reduction to NADH. As a result, the integrated system exhibited a conversion of &#8764;66&#8201;% within 20&#8197;minutes. By further coupling in&#8197;situ generated NADH with formate dehydrogenase (FDH), a photoenzymatic production of formic acid (HCOOH) from CO2 was accomplished. Moreover, by immobilizing FDH onto a hydrophobic membrane, an enhanced HCOOH production of &#8764;5.0&#8197;mM can be obtained due to the concentrated CO2 on the gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid three&#8208;phase interface. Our work herein provides an integrated strategy for coupling the anchored electron mediator with immobilized enzyme for enhanced artificial photosynthesis.

         <title>Understanding the Anion&#8208;Templated, OSDA&#8208;Free, Interzeolite Conversion Synthesis of High Silica Zeolite ZK&#8208;5
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High silica forms of the zeolite ZK&#8208;5 are prepared by an interzeolite conversion using inorganic cations and anions as templates. K+ and Cs+ cations and NO3&#8722; anions self&#8208;assemble within its lta and pau cages with a high degree of space filling and exchange with NH4+ followed by heating gives a microporous solid. This approach offers an alternative and organic structure directing agent&#8208;free route to directing zeolite synthesis.







Abstract
High silica zeolite ZK&#8208;5 (framework Si/Al=4.8) has been prepared by interzeolite conversion from ultrastable zeolite Y via a co&#8208;templating route using alkali metal cations and nitrate anions but without organic structure directing agents. The mechanism, which involves zeolite framework &#8211; alkali metal cation &#8211; nitrate anion ordering, has been established by a combination of chemical and thermal analyses, Raman spectroscopy, computational modelling, and X&#8208;ray powder diffraction. Ammonium exchange gives ZK&#8208;5 with occluded ammonium nitrate and subsequent heating gives microporous zeolite ZK&#8208;5.

         <title>Achieving Solution&#8208;Processed Non&#8208;Doped Single&#8208;Emitting&#8208;Layer White Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes through Adjusting Pyrene&#8208;Based Polyaromatic Hydrocarbon</title>

         <dc:description>
Two new pyrene&#8208;based polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) molecules&#8208;PyS and PyD were synthesized. Due to the more twisted and extended backbone, the bis&#8208;fused molecule PyD packed in neat Cmca space group in single&#8208;crystal system compared with P21/n for PyS, which may be favorable to form excimers in the solid state and showed solution&#8208;processed non&#8208;doped single&#8208;white&#8208;emitting&#8208;molecule SEL&#8208;WOLED with high performance.







Abstract
Single&#8208;emitting&#8208;layer white organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (SEL&#8208;WOLEDs) have developed rapidly in recent years due to the outstanding advantages of high efficiency, simple device structure, low cost, less phase separation, and stable emission color. Nevertheless, the relatively complicated host&#8208;dopant system is usually essential for most previous SEL&#8208;WOLEDs and the development of simple non&#8208;doped SEL&#8208;WOLEDs lags behind. Hence the straightforward synthesis of single&#8208;white&#8208;emitting molecules for non&#8208;doped SEL&#8208;WOLEDs still remains a great challengeable task. In this article, we designed and synthesized two new pyrene&#8208;based polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and used them as emitting layer materials in the OLED devices. When the molecules change from the mono&#8208;fused one to bis&#8208;fused one, the emitting light changes from greenish to white color. Further study indicated that the bis&#8208;fused molecule PyD with more twisted and extended backbone packed in neat Cmca space group in single&#8208;crystal system compared with P21/n for PyS, which may be favorable to form excimers in the solid state and broaden the emission spectrum in the OLEDs. As a result, a solution&#8208;processed non&#8208;doped single&#8208;white&#8208;emitting&#8208;molecule SEL&#8208;WOLED with high performance (e.&#8201;g., a high color rendering index of 66) is reported. The findings will be beneficial not only to further development of simple WOLEDs, but also to other related organic optoelectronic technology.

         <title>Homolytic N&#8722;S Bond Cleavage in Vinyl Triflimides Enabled by Triplet&#8211;Triplet Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
No need to pay for extras: Vinyl triflimides are a new compound class with unknown reactivity. Computational analysis identified homolytic cleavage of the N&#8722;Tf bond induced by triplet&#8211;triplet energy transfer (EnT) as an accessible reaction manifold. This hypothesis was verified, and vinyl triflimides were transformed into a range of &#945;&#8208;quaternary, &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethylated amines in a 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization reaction with no need for external CF3 reagents.







Abstract
Vinyl triflimides are a new compound class with unknown reactivity. A computational analysis identified homolytic cleavage of the N&#8722;Tf bond induced by triplet&#8211;triplet energy transfer (EnT) as a highly interesting reaction type that might be accessible. A combination of experimental and mechanistic work verified this hypothesis and proved the generated radicals to be amenable to radical&#8211;radical coupling. Thereby, vinyl triflimides were transformed into a range of &#945;&#8208;quaternary, &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethylated amines in a 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization reaction with no need for external CF3 reagents.

A combination of experimental and mechanistic work verified this hypothesis and proved the generated radicals to be amenable to radical&#8211;radical coupling. Thereby, vinyl triflimides were transformed into a range of &#945;-quaternary, &#946;-trifluoromethylated amines in a 1,2-difunctionalization reaction with no need for external CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; reagents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Vinylic Trifluoromethylselenolation via Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Trifluorometylselenolation via C&#8208;H activation is barely described in literature. In particular, no such vinylic functionalization has been yet described. Herein, a palladium&#8208;catalyzed trifluoromethylselenolation of vinylic C&#8208;H bonds is described. The 5&#8208;methoxy&#8208;8&#8208;aminoquinoline has been used as auxiliary directing group to perform this reaction. The reaction gives excellent yields with &#945;&#8208;substituted compounds whatever the substituents and a micro wave activation can be used to accelerate the reaction. With &#946;&#8208;substituted substrates lower yields, but still satisfactory, are obtained. This methodology was also successfully extended to other fluoroalkylselenyl groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Enantioenriched Sulfoxides by an Oxidation&#8208;Reduction Enzymatic Cascade</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral sulfoxides are versatile synthons and have gained a particular interest in asymmetric synthesis of active pharmaceutical and agrochemical ingredients. Herein we report a linear oxidation&#8208;reduction bienzymatic cascade to synthesize chiral sulfoxides. The extraordinarily stable and active vanadium&#8208;dependent chloroperoxidase from  Curvularia inaequalis  (  Ci  VCPO) was used to oxidize sulfides into racemic sulfoxides, which were then converted to chiral sulfoxides by highly enantioselective methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MsrA) and B (MsrB) via kinetic resolution, respectively. The combinatorial cascade yielded a broad range of structurally diverse sulfoxides with excellent optical purity (&gt; 99% ee) with complementary chirality. The enzymatic cascade requires no NAD(P)H recycling, representing a facile method for chiral sulfoxide synthesis. Particularly, the envisioned enzymatic cascade not only allows  Ci  VCPO to gain relevance in chiral sulfoxide synthesis, but also provide a powerful approach for (S)&#8208;sulfide synthesis, the latter case is significantly unexplored for heme&#8208;dependent peroxidases and peroxygenases.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 3&#8208;Borylated Pyrrolidines by 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition of Alkenyl Boronates and Azomethine Ylide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A scalable and efficient process for the preparation of 3&#8208;borylated pyrrolidines via the 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of in situ generated N&#8208;benzyl azomethine ylide was developed. The optimized method included the use of LiF in DMSO at 110&#160;&#176;C and was suitable for &#945;&#8208;mono&#8208;, &#945;,&#946;&#8208;di&#8208;, and &#945;,&#946;,&#946;&#8208;trialkyl&#8208;, &#946;,&#946;&#8208;(hetera)cycloalkylidene&#8208;, CO&#8322;Et&#8208;, as well as most &#946;&#8208;(het)aryl&#8208;substituted alkenyl boropinacola&#173;tes. The 1,3&#8208;dipolar reaction proceeded on multigram scale providing 3&#8208;borylated pyrrolidines with diverse substitution patterns (including fused and spirocyclic ones) in a diastereoselective manner. The Pd(OH)&#8322;&#8208;mediated N&#8208;debenzylation of pyrrolidine hydrochlorides was successfully performed to give the corresponding bifunctional building blocks on up to 130 g scale, thus providing a substantial expansion of the synthetic and medicinal chemist&#8217;s toolbox. Other reactions included the preparation of trifluoroborates, the Zweifel &#8211; Aggarwal sp&#179;&#8211; sp&#178;&#160;coupling, and oxidative deborylation as an example of C&#160;&#8211;&#160;heteroatom bond formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Infusion of variable chemical structure to tune stacking among metal&#8208;organic layers in 2D Nano MOF</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thickness of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) govern their intriguing functionalities. Primarily this thickness is controlled by the stacking between the metal&#8208;organic layers (MOL). It is observed that until now such modulating factors for stacking efficiency of MOL are still not well studied. Here, we report a fundamental hypothesis to comprehend regulation of stacking efficiency among MOLs as a function of chemical structure of organic ligands (dicarboxylic acids and pillar linkers). This basically involves a series of isostructural three&#8208;dimensional (3D) MOFs which contain linkers of variable chemical nature that could be depillared to generate 2D stacked MOFs of different thickness. Depending on the linkers, we encountered the formation of single MOL to stacked multiple MOLs as evidenced from atomic force microscopic and other experimental analysis. The present study gives a concrete correlation between the stacking within 2D MOFs (from monolayer to multilayers), and their 3D counter parts, which may provide a thickness tuning pathway for 2D MOFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving the Electrocatalytic Activity of Ni Organic Framework toward Oxygen Evolution Reaction by Vanadium Doping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been considered as a potential oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts, owning to their ultra&#8208;thin structure, adjustable composition, high surface area, and high porosity. Here, we designed and fabricated a vanadium&#8208;doped Ni organic frameworks (V1&#8208;x&#8208;NixMOF) system using a facile two&#8208;step solvothermal method on nickel foam (NF). The doping of V remarkably elevates the OER activity of V1&#8208;x&#8208;NixMOF, demonstrating better performance than the corresponding single metallic Ni&#8208;MOF, NiV&#8208;MOF and RuO2 catalysts at high current density (&gt;400 mA cm&#8208;2). V0.09&#8208;Ni0.91MOF/NF provides a low overpotential of 235 mV and a small Tafel slope of 30.3&#8201;mV dec&#8722;1 at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2. More importantly, the water splitting device assembled with Pt/C/NF and V0.09&#8208;Ni0.91MOF/NF as cathode and anode yield cell voltage of 1.96 V@1000 mA cm&#8208;2 outperforms the&#8208;state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art RuO2(+)||Pt/C(&#8208;). Our work sheds new insight into preparing stable, efficient OER electrocatalysts and a promising method for designing various MOF&#8208;based materials.</dc:description>

V0.09-Ni0.91MOF/NF provides a low overpotential of 235 mV and a small Tafel slope of 30.3&#8201;mV dec&#8722;1 at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2. More importantly, the water splitting device assembled with Pt/C/NF and V0.09-Ni0.91MOF/NF as cathode and anode yield cell voltage of 1.96 V@1000 mA cm-2 outperforms the-state-of-the-art RuO2(+)||Pt/C(-). Our work sheds new insight into preparing stable, efficient OER electrocatalysts and a promising method for designing various MOF-based materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Development efficient strategy for fabrication of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal organic framework (MOF) nanosheets with high yield and high stability is desirable. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that large&#8208;size and single&#8208;layer 2D Ni&#8208;BDC MOF nanosheets have been fabricated with the assistance of supercritical carbon dioxide (SC CO2 ) in pure aqueous system. Detailed experimental evidences reveal that the SC CO2 molecule can exchange with the lattice coordinated H2O molecules and side&#8208;on coordinate with the metal Ni1 sites on nickel&#8208;benzene dicarboxylate (Ni&#8208;BDC) surface, and finally break the interlayer hydrogen bond to exfoliate the bulk Ni&#8208;BDC into 2D MOF. More importantly, a thin SC CO2 layer building at the water&#8208;Ni&#8208;BDC interfaces can transform the pristine hydrophilic interface to super&#8208;hydrophobic one. The formed super&#8208;hydrophobic layer at the water&#8211;MOF interface can effectively prevent the dissociation reaction, thus promoting the stability of Ni&#8208;BDC in aqueous system.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of metal chalcogenide semiconductors by thermal decomposition of organosulfur and organoselenium compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal chalcogenides &#8211; because of their excellent optical and electrical properties &#8211; are important semiconductor materials for optical devices, such as solar cells, sensors, and photocatalysts. The challenges associated with metal chalcogenides are the complexity of the conventional synthesis methods and the stringent synthesis conditions. In this study, we simplified the synthesis conditions using a solvent&#8208;free synthesis method using cadmium precursor, thiourea and selenium to synthesize metal chalcogenides, such as CdS and CdSe, which have particularly suitable band gaps for the optical devices. CdS  x  Se  1&#8208;x  solid solution was successfully synthesized under molten thiourea as the reactive reaction medium at relatively low temperatures, even at 180&#176;C, with residual melamine derivatives in the solid phase. The luminescence properties of CdS  x  Se  1&#8208;x  and the products in the gas and solid phases were investigated. Optimization of the synthesis conditions for solid solutions of CdS  x  Se  1&#8208;x  and the role of organic compounds in the formation of metal chalcogenides are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>A Macrocyclic Furan with Accessible Oxidation States: Switching Between Aromatic and Antiaromatic Global Ring Currents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocyclic furans are predicted to switch between global aromaticity and antiaromaticity, depending on their oxidation states. However, the macrocyclic furans reported to date are stabilized by electron withdrawing groups, which result in inaccessible oxidation states. To circumvent this problem, a post&#8208;macrocyclization approach was applied to introduce methylene&#8208;substituted macrocyclic furans, which display an extremely low oxidation potential of &#8208;0.23  vs  . Fc/Fc  +  , and are partially oxidized in ambient conditions. Additional oxidation to the dication results in aromaticity switching to a global 30&#960;e  &#8208;  aromatic state, as indicated by the formation of a strong diatropic current observed in the  1  H&#8208;NMR spectrum. NICS and ACID calculations support this trend and provide evidence for a different pathway for the global current in the neutral and dicationic states. According to these findings, macrocyclic furans can be rendered as promising  p  &#8208;type materials with stable oxidation states.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantification of the Electrophilicities of Diazoalkanes: Kinetics and Mechanism of Azo Couplings with Enamines and Sulfonium Ylides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enamines and sulfonium ylides attack the terminal nitrogen of diazoalkanes with rate&#8208;determining formation of zwitterions. The measured second&#8208;order rate constants were used to determine the one&#8208;bond electrophilicities E of the diazoalkanes. Pyrazolines obtained from the reactions of diazoalkanes with enamines are not formed by 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions, but by cyclization of hydrazonoenamines initially formed by proton shifts in the intermediate zwitterions.







Abstract
Kinetics and mechanism of the reactions of methyl diazoacetate, dimethyl diazomalonate, 4&#8208;nitrophenyldiazomethane, and diphenyldiazomethane with sulfonium ylides and enamines were investigated by UV&#8208;Vis and NMR spectroscopy. Ordinary alkenes undergo 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions with these diazo compounds. In contrast, sulfonium ylides and enamines attack at the terminal nitrogen of the diazo alkanes to give zwitterions, which undergo various subsequent reactions. As only one new bond is formed in the rate&#8208;determining step of these reactions, the correlation lg&#8201;k2(20&#8201;&#176;C)=sN(N+E) could be used to determine the one&#8208;bond electrophilicities E of the diazo compounds from the measured second&#8208;order rate constants and the known reactivity indices N and sN of the sulfonium ylides and enamines. The resulting electrophilicity parameters (&#8722;21&lt;E&lt;&#8722;18), which are 11&#8211;14 orders of magnitude smaller than that of the benzenediazonium ion, are used to define the scope of one&#8208;bond nucleophiles which may react with these diazoalkanes.

The combination of experimental and computed data allows to disentangle and quantify complex dynamic conformational mixtures of xylosides. Computed spin&#8208;spin coupling constants bridge the gap between experimental NMR data and the conformer distribution.







Abstract
The conformational properties of monosaccharides constitute fundamental features of oligosaccharides. While the energy landscape of monosaccharides can be altered by a specific biochemical environment or by chemical modifications, the analysis of resulting dynamic conformational equilibria is not feasible by experimental means alone. In this work, a series of &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;xylopyranosides is used to outline how a combination of experimental NMR parameters and computed molecular properties can be used to determine conformers and quantify the composition of conformational equilibria. We demonstrate that identifying the most stable conformers using energy calculations is challenging and computing of NMR shieldings is typically not sensitive enough. On the other hand, computed spin&#8208;spin coupling constants for the xyloside ring can be used to unambiguously assign experimental NMR data of dynamic conformational equilibria and quantify the ratio of different conformers in the mixture. As a proof of principle, this procedure allowed to analyze a hitherto unknown dynamic equilibrium of a diamino&#8208;xyloside as a precursor of a molecular switch.

         <title>Cost&#8208;Effective 2D Ultrathin Metal&#8208;Organic Layers with Bis&#8208;Metallic Catalytic Sites for Visible Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work 2D ultrathin metal&#8208;organic layers (MOLs) with bis&#8208;metallic catalytic sites were developed to negate the blemish of low&#8208;density catalytic sites and low electron transmission efficiency on the surface of 3D MOFs, thus resulting in efficient and selective visible light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction by earth&#8208;abundant metal catalysis.







Abstract
As novel generated 2D materials, metal&#8208;organic layers (MOLs) have recently emerged as a potential platform for photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (PCO2RR). Such 2D structures negate the blemish of low&#8208;density catalytic sites and low electron transmission efficiency on the surface of metal organic frameworks (MOFs), while retaining the advantage of low expenditure when using earth&#8208;abundant metal nodes and meritorious applicability in the PCO2RR. Herein, it is reported that the 2D ultrathin layer material with bis&#8208;metallic catalytic sites (Ni&#8722;O metal node and the Ni&#8722;N metal site) from bidentate ligand 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;5,5&#8217;&#8208;dicarboxylate (H2bpydc) and nickel(II) remarkably boosts the visible light&#8208;driven PCO2RR performance with a CO yield of 2400&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 for 18&#8197;h and a selectivity up to 99&#8201;%. Consequently, the effects of morphology, catalytic sites and intrinsic properties on PCO2RR efficiency have been investigated in detail. In this context, the ultrathin layer structure has been elucidated as the key point to facilitate electron transfer efficiency. Notably, the bis&#8208;metallic catalytic sites with reasonable distance between two adjacent metals presumably induce synergistic effect and offer a guiding ideology for further designing high performance photocatalysts.

         <title>Acene Size&#8208;Dependent Transition of The Radical Centers From the Metal to The Acene Parts In Monocationic Dinuclear (Diethynylacene)diyl Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge&#8208;delocalization of various monocationic diruthenium (p&#8208;diethynylacene)diyl complexes was investigated. The distribution of the radical centers is dependent on the acene moieties; namely, the radical centers are shifted from the metal moiety (benzene) to the bridging dinuclear part (anthracene) and then to the acene part (pentacene).







Abstract
Controlling radical localization/delocalization is important for functional materials. The present paper describes synthesis and results of electrochemical, spectroscopic, and theoretical studies of diruthenium (p&#8208;diethynylacene)diyl complexes, Me3Si&#8208;(C&#8801;C)2&#8208;Ru(dppe)2&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8722;Ar&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8722;Ru(dppe)2&#8208;(C&#8801;C)2&#8208;SiMe3 (1&#8211;6) (dppe: 1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane), and their monocationic radical species ([1]+&#8211;[6]+). The HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gaps can be finely tuned by the acene rings in the bridging ligands installed, as indicated by the absorption maxima of the electronic spectra of 1&#8211;6 ranging from the UV region even to the NIR region. The cationic species [1]+&#8211;[6]+ show two characteristic NIR bands, which are ascribed to the charge resonance (CR) and &#960;&#8208;&#960;* transition bands, as revealed by spectroelectrochemistry. Expansion of the acene rings in [1]+&#8211;[6]+ causes (1) blue shifts of the CR bands and red shifts of the &#960;&#8208;&#960;* transition bands and (2) charge localization on the acene parts as evidenced by the ESR, DFT and TD&#8208;DFT analyses. Notably, the monocationic complexes of the larger acene derivatives are characterized as the non&#8208;classical acene&#8208;localized radicals.

         <title>Modulation of the sorption characteristics for an H&#8208;bonded porous architecture by varying the chemical functionalization of the channel walls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Five isostructural microporous supramolecular architectures prepared by H&#8208;bonded assembly between the hexa&#8208;anionic complex [Zr  2  (Ox)  7  ]  6&#8208;  (Ox = oxalate, (C  2  O  4  )  2&#8208;  ) and tripodal cations (H  3  &#8208;TripCH  2  &#8208;R)  3+  with R = H, CH  3  , OH and OBn (Bn = CH  2  Ph) are reported. The possibility to obtain the same structure using a mixture of tripodal cations with different R group (R = OH and R = CH  3  ) has also been successfully explored, providing a unique example of three&#8208;component H&#8208;bonded porous framework. The resulting SPA&#8208;1(R) materials feature 1D pores decorated by R groups, with apparent pore diameters ranging from 3.0 to 8.5 &#197;. Influence of R groups on the sorption properties of these materials is evidenced through CO  2  and H  2  O vapor sorption/desorption experiments, as well as with I  2  capture/release experiments in liquid media. This study is one of the first to demonstrate the possibility of tuning the porosity and exerting precise control over the chemical functionalization of the pores in a given H&#8208;bonded structure, without modifying the topology of the reference structure, and thus finely adjusting the sorption characteristics of the material.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecularly Imprinted Nanozymes with Free Substrate Access for Catalyzing the Ligation of ssDNA Sequences</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanozymes have attracted wide attention for the unique advantages of low cost, high stability and designability. Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) have demonstrated great potential as a new type of nanozymes due to their excellent specificity and high affinity. However, effective approaches for creating molecularly imprinted nanozymes still remain limited. Herein, we report a new approach called reverse microemulsion template docking surface imprinting (RMTD&#8208;SI) for the rational design and engineering of nanozymes with free substrate access for the ligation of ssDNA sequences. As a proof of the principle, octa&#8208;deoxyribonucleotide&#8208;imprinted nanoparticles were successfully prepared. Using tetradeoxyribonucleotides and octa&#8208;deoxyribonucleotide as substrates, the properties, catalytic activity and behaviors of the imprinted nanoparticles were thoroughly investigated. The imprinted nanozyme exhibited an enhanced reaction speed (by up to 41&#8208;fold) and good sequence selectivity towards substrate tetra&#8208;deoxyribonucleotides. More interestingly, due to the open substrate access, the imprinted nanozyme also allowed for catalyzing the ligation of a ssDNA that is fully complementary to the imprinted cavity to form longer sequences, but at the price of scarified substrate selectivity. Thus, this study provided not only a new avenue to the rational design and synthesis of molecularly imprinted nanozymes but also new insights of their catalytic behaviours.</dc:description>

         <title>Colloidal Stability of TiO2 Nanoparticles: The Roles of Phosphonate Ligand Length and Solution Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Don't go to any length: The hydrodynamic diameter was observed. In contrast to classical colloid theory, the dodecylphosphonate ligand provided better colloidal stability than the longer or shorter n&#8208;alkylphosphonate ligands. The proposed method is applicable to a wide range of colloidal nanoparticle systems.







Abstract
Surface ligands are essential tools for the stabilization of colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) in solvents. However, knowledge regarding the effects of the ligand shell, especially the ligand length, is insufficient and controversial. Here we demonstrate solution&#8208;based experiments on n&#8208;alkylphosphonate&#8208;capped TiO2 NPs to investigate the effects of ligand length and solution temperature on colloidal stability. A robust ligand&#8208;exchange process is achieved that draws free ligands and impurities away from the colloidal solution. In the case of 8&#8197;nm anatase NPs in toluene, the dodecylphosphonate ligand provided better colloidal stability than all the other n&#8208;alkylphosphonate ligands. In addition, relaxation studies suggested there is kinetic hysteresis in the dispersion/agglomeration transition. The proposed method is applicable to a wide range of surface ligands designed to maximize the colloidal stability of NPs.

         <dc:description>
An unprecedented Ru&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond hydroarylation of the in&#8197;situ generated 3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropyne from the inexpensive 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropene was developed to access &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethylstyrenes. A wide range of (hetero)arenes was functionalized leading selectively to the E&#8208;isomers. Detailed mechanistic studies and DFT calculations supported the involvement of an arene&#8208;free cyclometallated Ru(II) species and a bis&#8208;cyclometallated Ru complex as key intermediate.







Abstract
In this study, a practical and straightforward synthesis of &#946;&#8208;(E)&#8208;trifluoromethylstyrenes by ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activation was developed. The readily available and inexpensive 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropene (BTP), a non&#8208;ozone depleting reagent, was used as a reservoir of 3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropyne. With this approach, the monofunctionalization of a panel of heteroarenes was possible in a safe and scalable manner (23 examples, up to 87&#8201;% yield). Mechanistic investigations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were also conducted to get a better understanding of the mechanism of this transformation. These studies suggested that 1) a cyclometallated ruthenium complex enabled the transformation, 2) this complex exhibited high efficiency in this transformation compared to the commercially available [RuCl2(p&#8208;cymene)]2 and 3) the mechanism proceeded through a bis&#8208;cyclometallated ruthenium intermediate for the carboruthenation step.

         <title>Infrared Spectroscopy Elucidates the Inhibitor Binding Sites in a Metal&#8208;Dependent Formate Dehydrogenase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;dependent formate dehydrogenases (FDH) are capable of oxidizing formate to CO2 reversibly. Here, we compared IR spectroscopic data with DFT calculations and inhibition kinetics to study the putative binding mode of CO2/formate at the bis&#8208;MGD cofactor with the help of isoelectronic and charged product analogues. Experimental and theoretical data exclude a direct binding of the inhibitor molecules to the bis&#8208;MGD.







Abstract
Biological carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction is an important step by which organisms form valuable energy&#8208;richer molecules required for further metabolic processes. The Mo&#8208;dependent formate dehydrogenase (FDH) from Rhodobacter capsulatus catalyzes reversible formate oxidation to CO2 at a bis&#8208;molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide (bis&#8208;MGD) cofactor. To elucidate potential substrate binding sites relevant for the mechanism, we studied herein the interaction with the inhibitory molecules azide and cyanate, which are isoelectronic to CO2 and charged as formate. We employed infrared (IR) spectroscopy in combination with density functional theory (DFT) and inhibition kinetics. One distinct inhibitory molecule was found to bind to either a non&#8208;competitive or a competitive binding site in the secondary coordination sphere of the active site. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis of key amino acid residues in the vicinity of the bis&#8208;MGD cofactor revealed changes in both non&#8208;competitive and competitive binding, whereby the inhibitor is in case of the latter interaction presumably bound between the cofactor and the adjacent Arg587.

         <title>Intense Molar Circular Dichroism in Fully Conjugated All&#8208;Carbon Macrocyclic 1,3&#8208;Butadiyne Linked pseudo&#8208;meta [2.2]Paracyclophanes
</title>

         <dc:description>
Enantiopure trimeric, tetrameric, pentameric, and hexameric macrocyclic 1,3&#8208;butadiyne linked pseudo&#8208;meta [2.2]paracyclophanes were synthesized by a homocoupling reaction in high yields and their photophysical properties were analyzed. Investigating the chiroptical properties revealed unrivalled molar circular dichroism values for all&#8208;carbon macrocycles and efficient through&#8208;space conjugation to reach astounding polymer&#8208;like conjugation lengths.







Abstract
The synthetic access to macrocyclic molecular topologies with interesting photophysical properties has greatly improved thanks to the successful implementation of organic and inorganic corner units. Based on recent reports, we realized that pseudo&#8208;meta [2.2]paracyclophanes (PCPs) might serve as optimal corner units for constructing 3D functional materials, owing to their efficient electronic communication, angled substituents and planar chirality. Herein, we report the synthesis, characterization and optical properties of four novel all&#8208;carbon enantiopure macrocycles bearing three to six pseudo&#8208;meta PCPs linked by 1,3&#8208;butadiyne units. The macrocycles were obtained by a single step from enantiopure, literature&#8208;known dialkyne pseudo&#8208;meta PCP and were unambiguously identified and characterized by state of the art spectroscopic methods and in part even by x&#8208;ray crystallography. By comparing the optical properties to relevant reference compounds, it is shown that the pseudo&#8208;meta PCP subunit effectively elongates the conjugated system throughout the macrocyclic backbone, such that already the smallest macrocycle consisting of only three subunits reaches a polymer&#8208;like conjugation length. Additionally, it is shown that the chiral pseudo&#8208;meta PCPs induce a remarkable chiroptical response in the respective macrocycles, reaching unprecedented high molar circular dichroism values for all&#8208;carbon macrocycles of up to 1307&#8197;L&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8197;cm&#8722;1.

         <title>1+1&gt;2: Fiber Synergy in Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fibers are ideal carriers for AIEgens towards realizing sophisticated optical functions. On the single fiber level, the integration of a multiple functional components into a fiber provides adjustable microenvironments to manipulate the aggregate state of AIEgens. On the multiple&#8208;fiber level, the assembly of multiple fiber offers entangled network to produce large&#8208;scale fabrics to endow AIEgens with amplified functions and practical values.







Abstract
Mesoscopic aggregate is important to transfer or even amplify the molecular information in macroscopic materials. As an important branch of aggregate science, aggregation&#8208;induced emissive luminogens (AIEgens) often show slight or even no emission in solutions but exhibit bright emission when they aggregate, which open a new avenue for the practical applications. Due to the flexible and rotor structure of AIEgens, the aggregate structure of AIEgens is highly sensitive to the surrounding microenvironment, resulting in adjustable optical properties. Fibers integrated of a multiplicity of functional components are ideal carriers to control the aggregation processes, further assembly of fibers produces large&#8208;scale fabrics with amplified functions and practical values. In this Concept article, we focus on the latest advances on the synergy between &#8220;AIE+Fiber&#8221; for the boosted performance that beyond AIE, and their applications are presented and abstracted out to stimulate new ideas for developing &#8220;AIE+Fiber&#8221; systems.

         <title>Stereoselective Activation of Small Molecules by a Stable Chiral Silene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel cyclic and chiral silene was synthesized and fully characterized. The chiral (S)&#8208;BINOL scaffold in the silene enabled unprecedented complete control over the diastereoselectivity in the reactions with different small molecules, S8, CO2 and HCl.







Abstract
The reaction of the dilithium salt of the enantiopure (S)&#8208;BINOL (1,1&#8217;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol) with two equivalents of the amidinate&#8208;stabilized chlorosilylene [LPhSiCl] (LPh=PhC(NtBu)2) led to the formation of the first example of a chiral cyclic silene species comprising an (S)&#8208;BINOL ligand. The reactivity of the Si=C bond was investigated by reaction with elemental sulfur, CO2 and HCl. The reaction with S8 led to a Si=C bond cleavage and concomitantly to a ring&#8208;opened product with imine and silanethione functional groups. The reaction with CO2 resulted in the cleavage of the CO2 molecule into a carbonyl group and an isolated O atom, while a new stereocenter is formed in a highly selective manner. According to DFT calculations, the [2+2] cycloaddition product is the key intermediate. Further reactivity studies of the chiral cyclic silene with HCl resulted in a stereoselective addition to the Si=C bond, while the fully selective formation of two stereocenters was achieved. The quantitative stereoselective addition of CO2 and HCl to a Si=C bond is unprecedented.

         <title>Sterically Controlled Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization of Bulky Phosphines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the high affinity of phosphines for transition metals, C&#8722;H functionalization of aryl phosphines is dominated by phosphorous&#8208;directed reactions. Here we pair a sterically controlled borylation reaction of unprotected phosphines with phosphine self&#8208;assisted Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reactions to grant ready access to libraries of functionalized phosphines with a positional selectivity that complements existing methods. More information can be found in the Research Article by C.&#8197;N. Neumann et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202074).

         <title>C&#8722;H and Si&#8722;H Activation Reactions at Ru/Ga Complexes: A Combined Experimental and Theoretical Case Study on the Ru&#8722;Ga Bond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru/Ga compounds activate Si&#8722;H and C&#8722;H bonds. Triethylsilane and toluene are activated by the intermediate [Ru(GaCp*)3H2] and form the respective seven&#8208;fold coordinated Ru/Ga species. The bonding situation of the intermediate, the products, and their respective phosphine analogues are analyzed on the DFT level of theory, and the Ru&#8722;Ga and Ru&#8722;P bond are contrasted.







Abstract
Treatment of [Ru(COD)(MeAllyl)2] and [Ru(COD)(COT)] with GaCp* under hydrogenolytic conditions leads to reactive intermediates which activate Si&#8722;H or C&#8722;H bonds, respectively. The product complexes [Ru(GaCp*)3(SiEt3)H3] (1) and [Ru(GaCp*)3(C7H7)H3] (2) are formed with HSiEt3 or with toluene as the solvent, respectively. While 1 was isolated and fully characterized by NMR, MS, IR and SC&#8208;XRD, 2 was too labile to be isolated and was observed and characterized in&#8197;situ by using mass spectrometry, including labelling experiments for the unambiguous assignment of the elemental composition. The structural assignment was confirmed by DFT calculations. The relative energies of the four isomers possible upon toluene activation at the ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208;, para&#8208; and CH3&#8208;positions have been determined and point to aromatic C&#8722;H activation. The Ru&#8722;Ga bond was analyzed by EDA and QTAIM and compared to the Ru&#8722;P bond in the analogue phosphine compound. Bonding analyses indicate that the Ru&#8208;GaCp* bond is weaker than the Ru&#8208;PR3 bond.

&lt;p&gt;Treatment of [Ru(COD)(MeAllyl)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] and [Ru(COD)(COT)] with GaCp* under hydrogenolytic conditions leads to reactive intermediates which activate Si&#8722;H or C&#8722;H bonds, respectively. The product complexes [Ru(GaCp*)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(SiEt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) and [Ru(GaCp*)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;)H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) are formed with HSiEt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or with toluene as the solvent, respectively. While &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; was isolated and fully characterized by NMR, MS, IR and SC-XRD, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; was too labile to be isolated and was observed and characterized in&#8197;situ by using mass spectrometry, including labelling experiments for the unambiguous assignment of the elemental composition. The structural assignment was confirmed by DFT calculations. The relative energies of the four isomers possible upon toluene activation at the &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;- and CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-positions have been determined and point to aromatic C&#8722;H activation. The Ru&#8722;Ga bond was analyzed by EDA and QTAIM and compared to the Ru&#8722;P bond in the analogue phosphine compound. Bonding analyses indicate that the Ru-GaCp* bond is weaker than the Ru-PR&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; bond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Improved Reversible Zinc Storage Achieved in a Constitutionally Crystalline&#8208;Stable Mn(VO3)2 Nanobelts Cathode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystalline&#8208;stable Mn(VO3)2 nanobelts cathode presents the specific capacity of 350&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and maintain a capacity retention rate of 92&#8201;% for 10,000 cycles at a current density of 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. It also rendered good rate performance and obtained a reversible capacity of up to 200&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 600&#8197;cycles at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 even under &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. Benefiting from the unique tunnel type nanobelts structure, the Mn(VO3)2 nanobelts show high Zn2+ migration kinetics and stable framework for reversible ions de&#8208;/insertion.







Abstract
Rechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are potential for grid&#8208;scale applications owing to their safety, low price, and available sources. The development of ZIBs cathode with high specific capacity, wide operating voltage window and stable cyclability is urgently needed in next&#8208;generation commercial batteries. Herein, we report a structurally crystalline&#8208;stable Mn(VO3)2 nanobelts cathode for ZIBs prepared via a facile hydrothermal method. The as&#8208;synthesized Mn(VO3)2 exhibited high specific capacity of 350&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and maintained a capacity retention of 92&#8201;% after 10,000 cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. It also showed good rate performance and obtained a reversible capacity of up to 200&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 600 cycles at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 under &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. The electrochemical tests suggest that Mn(VO3)2 nanobelts impart fast Zn2+ ions migration, and the introduction of manganese atoms help make the structures more indestructible, leading to a good rate performance and prolonged cycle lifespan.

         <title>Heterolytic O&#8722;O Bond Cleavage Upon Single Electron Transfer to a Nonheme Fe(III)&#8722;OOH Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The one&#8208;electron reduction of a nonheme FeIII(OOH) intermediate results in the release of the FeII(OH) complex and O2, following a bimolecular reaction consistent with the disproportionation of the hydroperoxo ligand in a putative FeII(OOH) species. One plausible mechanistic scenario is that this disproportionation reaction follows an O&#8722;O heterolytic cleavage pathway via a FeIV&#8208;oxo species.







Abstract
The one&#8208;electron reduction of the nonheme iron(III)&#8208;hydroperoxo complex, [FeIII(OOH)(L52)]2+ (L52=N&#8208;methyl&#8208;N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine), carried out at &#8722;70&#8201;&#176;C results in the release of dioxygen and in the formation of [FeII(OH)(L52)]+ following a bimolecular process. This reaction can be performed either with cobaltocene as chemical reductant, or electrochemically. These experimental observations are consistent with the disproportionation of the hydroperoxo group in the putative FeII(OOH) intermediate generated upon reduction of the FeIII(OOH) starting complex. One plausible mechanistic scenario is that this disproportionation reaction follows an O&#8722;O heterolytic cleavage pathway via a FeIV&#8208;oxo species.

         <title>Optical Modulation of Antibiotic Resistance by Photoswitchable Cystobactamids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cystobactamids, natural products with potent antibiotic properties, have been equipped with mono&#8208; or double&#8208;photoswitches. Antibiotic and gyrase inhibition properties, but also the sensitivity towards the two resistance factors AlbD and and AlbA was light&#8208;dependent.







Abstract
The rise of antibiotic resistance causes a serious health care problem, and its counterfeit demands novel, innovative concepts. The combination of photopharmacology, enabling a light&#8208;controlled reversible modulation of drug activity, with antibiotic drug design has led to first photoswitchable antibiotic compounds derived from established scaffolds. In this study, we converted cystobactamids, gyrase&#8208;inhibiting natural products with an oligoaryl scaffold and highly potent antibacterial activities, into photoswitchable agents by inserting azobenzene in the N&#8208;terminal part and/or an acylhydrazone moiety near the C&#8208;terminus, yielding twenty analogs that contain mono&#8208; as well as double&#8208;switches. Antibiotic and gyrase inhibition properties could be modulated 3.4&#8208;fold and 5&#8208;fold by light, respectively. Notably, the sensitivity of photoswitchable cystobactamids towards two known resistance factors, the peptidase AlbD and the scavenger protein AlbA, was light&#8208;dependent. While irradiation of an analog with an N&#8208;terminal azobenzene with 365&#8197;nm light led to less degradation by AlbD, the AlbA&#8208;mediated inactivation was induced. This provides a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle that resistance towards photoswitchable antibiotics can be optically controlled.

         <title>Molybdenum(VI) Bis(imido) Complexes: From Frustrated Lewis Pairs to Weakly Coordinating Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Demonstration of how to teach well&#8208;known molybdenum bis(imido) complexes new and unexpected reactivities. These frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP) perform heterolytic dihydrogen splitting under ion pair formation consisting of molybdenum amido cations and hydroborates. They prove to be effective catalysts in the hydrosilylation of aldehydes. The molybdenum cations influence the outcome pointing towards their behaviour as weakly coordinating cations (WCCs).







Abstract
Molybdenum(VI) bis(imido) complexes [Mo(NtBu)2(LR)2] (R=H 1&#8201;a; R=CF3 1&#8201;b) combined with B(C6F5)3 (1&#8201;a/B(C6F5)3, 1&#8201;b/B(C6F5)3) exhibit a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) character that can heterolytically split H&#8722;H, Si&#8722;H and O&#8722;H bonds. Cleavage of H2 and Et3SiH affords ion pairs [Mo(NtBu)(NHtBu)(LR)2][HB(C6F5)3] (R=H 2&#8201;a; R=CF3 2&#8201;b) composed of a Mo(VI) amido imido cation and a hydridoborate anion, while reaction with H2O leads to [Mo(NtBu)(NHtBu)(LR)2][(HO)B(C6F5)3] (R=H 3&#8201;a; R=CF3 3&#8201;b). Ion pairs 2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b are catalysts for the hydrosilylation of aldehydes with triethylsilane, with 2&#8201;b being more active than 2&#8201;a. Mechanistic elucidation revealed insertion of the aldehyde into the B&#8722;H bond of [HB(C6F5)3]&#8722;. We were able to isolate and fully characterize, including by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, the inserted products Mo(NtBu)(NHtBu)(LR)2][{PhCH2O}B(C6F5)3] (R=H 4&#8201;a; R=CF3 4&#8201;b). Catalysis occurs at [HB(C6F5)3]&#8722; while [Mo(NtBu)(NHtBu)(LR)2]+ (R=H or CF3) act as the cationic counterions. However, the striking difference in reactivity gives ample evidence that molybdenum cations behave as weakly coordinating cations (WCC).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Demonstration of how to teach&lt;/b&gt; well-known molybdenum bis(imido) complexes new and unexpected reactivities. These frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP) perform heterolytic dihydrogen splitting under ion pair formation consisting of molybdenum amido cations and hydroborates. They prove to be effective catalysts in the hydrosilylation of aldehydes. The molybdenum cations influence the outcome pointing towards their behaviour as weakly coordinating cations (WCCs).

         <title>Chiral Motifs in Highly Interpenetrated Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Formed from Achiral Tetrahedral Ligands
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrahydral achiral ligands and copper ions assemble into a record number of interpenetrating diamondoid networks. The networks intertwine akin to strands of a molecular rope to shape the chiral channels. The design of the ligand &#8220;arms&#8221; allows modulating their degree of interpenetration and the channel properties. The concurrent presence of such numerous interpenetrated networks and porosity is unprecedented for metal&#8211;organic frameworks.







Abstract
Formation of highly interpenetrated frameworks is demonstrated. An interesting observation is the presence of very large adamantane&#8208;shaped cages in a single network, making these crystals new entries in the collection of diamondoid&#8208;type metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). The frameworks were constructed by assembling tetrahedral pyridine ligands and copper dichloride. Currently, the networks&#8217; degree of interpenetration is among the highest reported and increases when the size of the ligand is increased. Highly interpenetrated frameworks typically have low surface contact areas. In contrast, in our systems, the voids take up to 63&#8201;% of the unit cell volume. The MOFs have chiral features but are formed from achiral components. The chirality is manifested by the coordination chemistry around the metal center, the structure of the helicoidal channels, and the motifs of the individual networks. Channels of both handednesses are present within the unit cells. This phenomenon shapes the walls of the channels, which are composed of 10, 16, or 32 chains correlated with the degree of interpenetration 10&#8208;, 16&#8208;, and 32&#8208;fold, respectively. By changing the distance between the center of the ligand and the coordination moieties, we succeeded in tuning the diameter of the channels. Relatively large channels were formed, having diameters up to 31.0&#8197;&#197;&#215;14.8&#8197;&#197;.

         <title>Synchrotron X&#8208;ray Electron Density Analysis of Chemical Bonding in the Graphitic Carbon Nitride Precursor Melamine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Odd one out: Melamine is the precursor for the polycondensation reaction to graphitic carbon nitride materials with a range of important applications. It is found that one amine group in melamine is significantly different from the others, and based on extensive analysis of the experimental and theoretical electron density this particular amine group is suggested to be the origin of the condensation process.







Abstract
Melamine is a precursor and building block for graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;CN) materials, a group of layered materials showing great promise for catalytic applications. The synthetic pathway to g&#8208;CN includes a polycondensation reaction of melamine by evaporation of ammonia. Melamine molecules in the crystal organize into wave&#8208;like planes with an interlayer distance of 3.3&#8197;&#197; similar to that of g&#8208;CN. Here we present an extensive investigation of the experimental electron density of melamine obtained from modelling of synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal diffraction data measured at 25&#8197;K with special focus on the molecular geometry and intermolecular interactions. Both intra&#8208; and interlayer structures are dominated by hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;interactions. Theoretical gas&#8208;phase optimizations of the experimental molecular geometry show that bond lengths and angles for atoms in the same chemical environment (C&#8722;N bonds in the ring, amine groups) differ significantly more for the experimental geometry than for the gas&#8208;phase&#8208;optimized geometries, indicating that intermolecular interactions in the crystal affects the molecular geometry. In the experimental crystal geometry, one amine group has significantly more sp3&#8208;like character than the others, hinting at a possible formation mechanism of g&#8208;CN. Topological analysis and energy frameworks show that the nitrogen atom in this amine group participates in weak intralayer hydrogen bonding. We hypothesize that melamine condenses to g&#8208;CN within the layers and that the unique amine group plays a key role in the condensation process.

         <title>From CsKTaF7 to CsNaTaF7: Alkali Metal Cations Regulation to Generate SHG Activity
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new mixed&#8208;alkali metal tantalum fluorides CsATaF7 (A=K, Na) were synthesized by hydrothermal reactions based on the parent compounds A2MF7 (A=monovalent cations and M&#8208;d0 transition&#8208;metal cation). Interesting structure transformation for &#946;&#8208;K2TaF7, CsKTaF7, and CsNaTaF7 are induced via alkali metal cation regulations. Among them, CsNaTaF7 crystallizes in polar structure and own moderate SHG effect.







Abstract
Inorganic metal halides play important roles in wide range of areas including fluorescence, X&#8208;ray detection, and nonlinear&#8208;optics. Herein, two new mixed alkali metal tantalum fluorides, CsKTaF7 and CsNaTaF7, have been obtained based on the strategy of cations regulation in A2MF7 (A represents monovalent cations and M is d0 transition&#8208;metal cation) system by a conventional hydrothermal route. CsKTaF7 crystallizes in the centric Pnma space group, while CsNaTaF7 crystallizes in the polar Cmc21 space group and exhibits moderate and phase&#8208;matchable NLO activity. Both halides possess large optical band gaps above 5.0&#8197;eV. The crystal structure evolution, optical properties, and detailed theory calculations of these two halides were elucidated in this work.

         <title>Heavy Alkali Metal Manganate Complexes: Synthesis, Structures and Solvent&#8208;Induced Dissociation Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heavy alkali metal alkyls can form ate compounds with manganese bis(amides) when donor solvents are absent but introducing the common donors TMEDA or PMDETA leads to breakdown of the ates together with ligand exchange, which results in the formation of new solvated heavier alkali metal amides and alkylmanganese amides.







Abstract
Rare examples of heavier alkali metal manganates [{(AM)Mn(CH2SiMe3)(N&#8216;Ar)2}&#8734;] (AM=K, Rb, or Cs) [N&#8216;Ar=N(SiMe3)(Dipp), where Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3] have been synthesised with the Rb and Cs examples crystallographically characterised. These heaviest manganates crystallise as polymeric zig&#8208;zag chains propagated by AM&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;&#8208;arene interactions. Key to their preparation is to avoid Lewis base donor solvents. In contrast, using multidentate nitrogen donors encourages ligand scrambling leading to redistribution of these bimetallic manganate compounds into their corresponding homometallic species as witnessed for the complete Li &#8208; Cs series. Adding to the few known crystallographically characterised unsolvated and solvated rubidium and caesium s&#8208;block metal amides, six new derivatives ([{AM(N&#8216;Ar)}&#8734;], [{AM(N&#8216;Ar)&#8901;TMEDA}&#8734;], and [{AM(N&#8216;Ar)&#8901;PMDETA}&#8734;] where AM=Rb or Cs) have been structurally authenticated. Utilising monodentate diethyl ether as a donor, it was also possible to isolate and crystallographically characterise sodium manganate [(Et2O)2Na(nBu)Mn[(N&#8216;Ar)2], a monomeric, dinuclear structure prevented from aggregating by two blocking ether ligands bound to sodium.

         <title>Spectroscopic Signature of Dynamical Instability of the Aqueous Complex in the Brown&#8208;Ring Nitrate Test

Dynamical instabilities in the brown&#8208;ring test: Hydration dynamics around the iron nitrosyl moiety leads to an equilibrium between two complexes, with very different UV&#8208;vis spectra. Ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamics simulations and ab&#8208;initio multi&#8208;reference methods predict that classically established pseudo&#8208;octahedral [Fe(H2O)5(NO)]2+ complex is present along with a square&#8208;pyramidal [Fe(H2O)4(NO)]2+ complex in aqueous solution. The features of the experimental UV&#8208;vis spectrum can be theoretically reproduced only by accounting these two species and not the [Fe(H2O)5(NO)]2+ complex alone.







Abstract
The chemistry of the brown&#8208;ring test has been investigated for nearly a century. Though recent studies have focused on solid state structure determination and measurement of spectra, mechanistic details and kinetics, the aspects of solution structure and dynamics remain unknown. We have studied structural fluctuations of the brown&#8208;ring complex in aqueous solution with ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamics simulations, from which we identified that the classically established pseudo&#8208;octahedral [Fe(H2O)5(NO)]2+ complex is present along with a square&#8208;pyramidal [Fe(H2O)4(NO)]2+ complex. Based on the inability in multi&#8208;reference calculations to reproduce the experimental UV&#8208;vis spectra in aqueous solution by inclusion of thermal fluctuations of the [Fe(H2O)5(NO)]2+ complex alone, we propose the existence of an equilibrium between pseudo&#8208;octahedral and square&#8208;pyramidal complexes. Despite challenges in constructing models reproducing the solid&#8208;state UV&#8208;vis spectrum, the advanced spectrum simulation tool motivates us to challenge the established picture of a sole pseudo&#8208;octahedral complex in solution.

         <title>A Supramolecular Strategy for the Synthesis of Cyclic Oligomers and Polymers by Ring Expansion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of a thiourea derivative (the guest) to an unstrained, olefin&#8208;containing macrocycle (the monomer), in the presence of a Grubbs catalyst, initiates a rapid ring&#8208;expansion reaction. The role of the guest is to inhibit a ring&#8208;closing reaction back to the monomer and this leads to the selective formation of cyclic oligomers with molecular weights up to 6700&#8197;Da.







Abstract
Ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of strained macrocycles is a key method to prepare diverse polymers. However, lack of ring strain in most macrocycles is an impediment to polymerization. In this paper, the polymerization/oligomerization of unstrained macrocycles was achieved using a supramolecular approach, leading selectively to cyclic products. Diphenyl thiourea and other guest molecules were used as additives to the ROMP reaction of unstrained macrocycles. An intermediate host&#8208;guest complex leads to the stabilization of the open form of the macrocycle after treatment with Grubbs catalysts, thereby favoring polymerization by inhibiting the ring&#8208;closing reaction back to the monomer. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept enables ring&#8208;expansion polymerization of unstrained macrocycles leading to cyclic polymers with molecular weights up to 6700&#8197;Da.

         <title>Development of an Allenyne&#8208;Alkyne [4+2] Cycloaddition and its Application to Total Synthesis of Selaginpulvilin A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complex character of a strained molecule. the &#945;,3&#8208;dehydrotoluene generated via the [4+2] cycloaddition of allenyne&#8208;alkyne can be trapped with a hydrogen atom donor or nucleophiles with two opposite regioselectivity; oxygen nucleophiles are incorporated at the benzylic position whereas amine nucleophiles are incorporated onto the aromatic core. This unique reactivity and selectivity is exploited for selaginpuvilin synthesis.







Abstract
A new [4+2] cycloaddition of allenyne&#8208;alkyne is developed. The reaction is believed to proceed with forming an &#945;,3&#8208;dehydrotoluene intermediate. This species behaves as a &#963;&#960;&#8208;diradical to react with a hydrogen atom donor, whereas it displays a zwitterionic reactivity toward weak nucleophiles. The efficiency of trapping &#945;,3&#8208;dehydrotoluene depends not only on its substituents but also the trapping agents. Notable features of the reaction are the activating role of the extra alkyne of the 1,3&#8208;diyne that reacts with the allenyne moiety and the opposite mode of trapping with oxygen and nitrogen nucleophiles. Oxygen nucleophiles result in the oxygen&#8208;end incorporation at the benzylic position of the &#945;,3&#8208;dehydrotoluene, whereas with amine nucleophiles the nitrogen&#8208;end is incorporated into the aromatic core. Relying on the allenyne&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition as an enabling strategy, a concise total synthesis of phosphodiesterase&#8208;4 inhibitory selaginpulvilin A is realized.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Complex character&lt;/b&gt; of a strained molecule. the &#945;,3-dehydrotoluene generated via the [4+2] cycloaddition of allenyne-alkyne can be trapped with a hydrogen atom donor or nucleophiles with two opposite regioselectivity; oxygen nucleophiles are incorporated at the benzylic position whereas amine nucleophiles are incorporated onto the aromatic core. This unique reactivity and selectivity is exploited for selaginpuvilin synthesis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new [4+2] cycloaddition of allenyne-alkyne is developed. The reaction is believed to proceed with forming an &#945;,3-dehydrotoluene intermediate. This species behaves as a &#963;&#960;-diradical to react with a hydrogen atom donor, whereas it displays a zwitterionic reactivity toward weak nucleophiles. The efficiency of trapping &#945;,3-dehydrotoluene depends not only on its substituents but also the trapping agents. Notable features of the reaction are the activating role of the extra alkyne of the 1,3-diyne that reacts with the allenyne moiety and the opposite mode of trapping with oxygen and nitrogen nucleophiles. Oxygen nucleophiles result in the oxygen-end incorporation at the benzylic position of the &#945;,3-dehydrotoluene, whereas with amine nucleophiles the nitrogen-end is incorporated into the aromatic core. Relying on the allenyne-alkyne cycloaddition as an enabling strategy, a concise total synthesis of phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitory selaginpulvilin A is realized.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>New Opportunities for the Utilization of the Sulfoximine Group in Medicinal Chemistry from the Drug Designer's Perspective
</title>

The sulfoximine group has emerged from a &#8216;lab oddity&#8217; to become a &#8216;rising star in modern drug discovery&#8217;. Even though the increasing interest in this versatile functional group in recent years has resulted in several sulfoximine clinical candidates, there is ample room for further innovative applications. This minireview highlights emerging trends and opportunities for drug designers for the utilization of the sulfoximine group, such as in the construction of complex molecules, PROTACs, ADCs and novel warheads for covalent inhibition.







Abstract
Extension of the medicinal chemistry toolbox is in the vital interest of drug designers. However, the diffusion of an innovation can be a lengthy process. Along these lines, it took almost 70&#8197;years before the use of the sulfoximine group reached a critical mass in medicinal chemistry. Even though interest in this versatile functional group has increased exponentially in recent years, there is ample room for further innovative applications. This Review highlights emerging trends and opportunities for drug designers for the utilization of the sulfoximine group in medicinal chemistry, such as in the construction of complex molecules, proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs), antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs) and novel warheads for covalent inhibition.
