         <title>Study of ground state interactions of enantiopure chiral quaternary ammonium salts and amides, nitroalkanes, nitroalkenes, esters, heterocycles, ketones and fluoroamides.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral Phase&#8208;Transfer Catalysis provides high level of enantiocontrol, however no experimental data showed the interaction of catalysts and substrates. We have carried out 1H&#8208;NMR titration of Cinchona and Maruoka ammonium bromides vs nitro, carbonyl, heterocycles, and N&#8208;F containing compounds. We found that neutral organic species and quaternary ammonium salts interacted via an ensemble of catalyst +N&#8208;C&#8208;H and (sp2)C&#8208;H, specific for each substrate studied. The correspondent BArF salts interacted with carbonyls via a diverse set of +N&#8208;C&#8208;H and (sp2)C&#8208;H compared to bromides. This data suggests that BArF ammonium salts may display a different enantioselectivity profile. Although not providing quantitative data for the affinity constants, the data reported proofs that chiral ammonium salts coordinate with substrates, prior to transition state, via specific C&#8208;H positions in their structures, providing a new rational to rationalize the origin of enantioselectivity in their catalyses.</dc:description>

         <title>Zinc&#8208; and Cadmium meso&#8208;Aryl&#8208;Isoporphyrins: Non&#8208;Aromatic NIR Dyes with Distinct Conformational Features</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new sign has risen in the porphyrin sky! Stable isoporphyrins can be produced as non&#8208;aromatic NIR dyes in yields up to 36&#8201;% by a one&#8208;pot process. Non&#8208;planar distortion modes are the key to control the optical spectra and the occurrence of isomers by means of synthesis. For the first time, the redox chemistry of isoporphyrins was studied by electrochemical methods, which is significant with regard to potential applications in photovoltaics.







Abstract
A series of pyrrolyl and dipyrrinyl isoporphyrins carrying different phenyl and thienyl groups is reported. The compounds are obtained by a one&#8208;pot approach in the presence of a template reagent. Thienyl derivatives gave better yields, and were the only subclass to form with steric hindrance. The structural analyses carried out on compounds 1 and 14 revealed distinct conformational differences which are likely to result from an intramolecular NH&#8230;Cl hydrogen bridge of the pyrrolyl subclass. In addition, this hydrogen bridge strongly favors one of the two possible atropisomers. Hindered rotation of the meso&#8208;aryl groups is observed only in the cases of methylbenzothienyl derivatives 10 and 15 and leads to the observation of several diastereomers. NIR absorptions up to 923&#8197;nm are found throughout. Electrochemical investigations into the 1e&#8722; and 2e&#8722; reduced species unravel axial ligand exchange dynamics for the zinc isoporphyrin radical, and the probable formation of a zinc phlorinate.

         <title>Solvent Induced Helix Folding of Defined Indolenine Squaraine Oligomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of defined indolenine squaraine dye oligomers up to the nonamer were synthesised via iterative cross coupling. Depending on the solvent either a random coil (J&#8208;type) or a loose helix (H&#8208;type) is formed. Structural and folding properties were examined via optical spectroscopy, DOSY NMR, SANS and computations.







Abstract
A protecting group strategy was employed to synthesise a series of indolenine squaraine dye oligomers up to the nonamer. The longer oligomers show a distinct solvent dependence of the absorption spectra, that is, either a strong blue shift or a strong red shift of the lowest energy bands in the near infrared spectral region. This behaviour is explained by exciton coupling theory as being due to H&#8208; or J&#8208;type coupling of transition moments. The H&#8208;type coupling is a consequence of a helix folding in solvents with a small Hansen dispersity index. DOSY NMR, small angle neutron scattering (SANS), quantum chemical and force field calculations agree upon a helix structure with an unusually large pitch and open voids that are filled with solvent molecules, thereby forming a kind of clathrate. The thermodynamic parameters of the folding process were determined by temperature dependent optical absorption spectra.

         <title>Controlled Synthesis of Large Single Crystals of Metal&#8208;Organic Framework CPO&#8208;27&#8208;Ni Prepared by a Modulation Approach: In situ Single&#8208;Crystal X&#8208;ray Diffraction Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel mixed linker modulation approach yielded large single crystals of CPO&#8208;27&#8208;Ni, an analogue that has not yet been able to be studied via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction due to crystal size limitations. This study investigates the nitric oxide, an important therapeutic agent, gas loading behavior of CPO&#8208;27&#8208;Ni single crystals utilizing an in&#8197;situ gas cell setup using synchrotron radiation.







Abstract
The size of single crystals of the metal&#8208;organic framework CPO&#8208;27&#8208;Ni was incrementally increased through a series of modulated syntheses. A novel linker modulated synthesis using 2,5&#8208;dihydroxyterephthalic acid and the isomeric ligand 4,6&#8208;dihydroxyisophthalic acid yielded large single crystals of CPO&#8208;27&#8208;Ni (&#8764;70&#8197;&#956;m). All materials were shown to have high crystallinity and phase purity through powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, electron microscopy methods, thermogravimetry, and compositional analysis. For the first time single&#8208;crystal structure analyses were carried out on CPO&#8208;27&#8208;Ni. High BET surface areas and nitric oxide (NO) release efficiencies were recorded for all materials. Large single crystals of CPO&#8208;27&#8208;Ni showed a prolonged NO release and proved suitable for in&#8197;situ single&#8208;crystal diffraction experiments to follow the NO adsorption. An efficient activation protocol was developed, leading to a dehydrated structure after just 4&#8197;h, which subsequently was NO&#8208;loaded, leading to a first NO loaded single&#8208;crystal structural model of CPO&#8208;27&#8208;Ni.

         <title>Rhodium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Bond Functionalization of 2&#8208;Pyridones with Alkynes: Switchable Alkenylation, Alkenylation/Directing Group Migration and Rollover Annulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under control: From a single starting material, three different products can be prepared with excellent chemoselectivity in the presence of a rhodium precatalyst. Conditions for the synthesis of vinylated pyridones, tetrasubstituted alkenes, and annulated pyridone derivatives are advanced using 1&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;2&#8208;pyridones. Through careful choice of co&#8208;catalysts and additives, the reaction paths can be successfully manipulated to provide products that are difficult to access by other methods. Experimental and DFT studies provide insight into the diverse reaction pathways.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Under control&lt;/b&gt;: From a single starting material, three different products can be prepared with excellent chemoselectivity in the presence of a rhodium precatalyst. Conditions for the synthesis of vinylated pyridones, tetrasubstituted alkenes, and annulated pyridone derivatives are advanced using 1&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;2&#8208;pyridones. Through careful choice of co&#8208;catalysts and additives, the reaction paths can be successfully manipulated to provide products that are difficult to access by other methods. Experimental and DFT studies provide insight into the diverse reaction pathways.

         <title>Chiral&#8208;at&#8208;Iron Catalyst for Highly Enantioselective and Diastereoselective Hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral&#8208;at&#8208;iron complex, in which all coordinated ligands are achiral and the overall chirality is exclusively due to a stereogenic iron center, catalyzes hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reactions with high diastereoselectivities (up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr) and enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;% ee). Key for this excellent stereocontrol are bulky 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl substituents at the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands which increase the steric hindrance at the catalytic site.







Abstract
This study demonstrates that chiral&#8208;at&#8208;iron complexes, in which all coordinated ligands are achiral and the overall chirality the consequence of a stereogenic iron center, are capable of catalyzing asymmetric transformations with very high enantioselectivities. The catalyst is based on a previously reported design (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2017, 139, 4322), in which iron(II) is surrounded by two configurationally inert achiral bidentate N&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;substituted N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes in a C2&#8208;symmetric fashion and complemented by two labile acetonitriles. By replacing mesityl with more bulky 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl substituents at the NHC ligands, the steric hindrance at the catalytic site was increased, thereby providing a markedly improved asymmetric induction. The new chiral&#8208;at&#8208;iron catalyst was applied to the inverse electron demand hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated &#945;&#8208;ketoester and enol ethers provide 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrans in high yields with excellent diastereoselectivities (up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr) and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;% ee). Other electron rich dienophiles are also suitable as demonstrated for a reaction with a vinyl azide.

         <title>Click Chemistry in Ultra&#8208;high Vacuum &#8211; Tetrazine Coupling with Methyl Enol Ether Covalently Linked to Si(001)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalyst&#8208;free coupling of a tetrazine derivative and an enol ether group, the latter being covalently attached on a Si(001) surface via cyclooctyne, has been observed in ultra&#8208;high vacuum by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. DFT calculations identified the associated reaction meachanism. This click chemistry scheme allows the synthesis of covalently bound molecular architectures on highly reactive surfaces in a UHV environment.







Abstract
The additive&#8208;free tetrazine/enol ether click reaction was performed in ultra&#8208;high vacuum (UHV) with an enol ether group covalently linked to a silicon surface: Dimethyl 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine&#8208;3,6&#8208;dicarboxylate molecules were coupled to the enol ether group of a functionalized cyclooctyne which was adsorbed on the silicon (001) surface via the strained triple bond of cyclooctyne. The reaction was observed at a substrate temperature of 380&#8197;K by means of X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). A moderate energy barrier was deduced for this click reaction in vacuum by means of density functional theory based calculations, in good agreement with the experimental results. This UHV&#8208;compatible click reaction thus opens a new, flexible route for synthesizing covalently bound organic architectures.

         <title>Binding of a TlCl Entity by a Tetragold Tetramercaptothiacalixarene Metalloligand via Metallophilic Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
p&#8208;tert&#8208;butyltetramercaptotetrathiacalix[4]arene was used as a coordination platform to synthesize and investigate gold(I) complexes with varying nuclearity. Aiming at the corresponding tetranuclear complex through salt metathesis it was found capable of binding a neutral, molecular TlCl entity by metallophilic interactions, as shown by structural and theoretical investigations. These Interactions lead to photoluminescence at low temperatures (see figure).







Abstract
The successive auration of p&#8208;tert&#8208;butyltetramercaptotetrathiacalix[4]arene, H4(MTC[4]), with gold(I) phosphine units was investigated. Through deprotonation with NaOMe, followed by salt metathesis reactions with (PR3)AuCl (R=Me, Ph) complexes with two and three [(PR3)Au]+ moieties could be prepared and isolated, namely [(Ph3PAu)2H2(MTC[4])] and [(Me3PAu)3H(MTC[4])]. In [(Me3PAu)3H(MTC[4])] two gold atoms already come close enough to undergo aurophilic interactions. To introduce a fourth [(PR3)Au]+ entity TlOEt had to be used for the deprotonation, which led to the finding that four gold atoms organised by the (MTC[4])4&#8722; coordination platform are able to bind and stabilize a TlCl entity, yielding [(Me3PAu)4TlCl(MTC[4])]. As evidenced by structural and theoretical investigations the binding occurs through strong metallophilic interactions, which lead to photoluminescence at low temperatures.

         <title>Oligomers Intermediates in Between Two New Distinct Homonuclear Uranium(IV) DOTP Complexes**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interaction between tetravalent uranium and DOTP, a cyclen&#8208;derived tetraphosphonic ligand, was studied in aqueous solutions. It resulted in the eventual formation of two new different homo&#8208;nuclear species, [UIV(DOTPH4)] and [UIV(DOTPH6)2]. Various analytical techniques showed that a pH&#8208;dependent, reversible and irreversible oligomerization processes govern both species in&#8208;solution dynamics.







Abstract
Two new aqueous UIV complexes were synthesized by the interaction between the tetravalent uranium cation and the (1,4,7,10&#8208;Tetraazacyclododecane&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetra(methylene phosphonic acid) (DOTP) macrocyclic ligand. Two distinct homonuclear complexes were identified; the first was characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography as a unique &#8220;out&#8208;of&#8208;cage&#8221;, [U(DOTPH6)2] complex, in which the UIV cation is octa&#8208;coordinated to 4 phosphonic arms from each ligand in a square anti&#8208;prism geometry, with a C4 symmetry.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The interaction&lt;/b&gt; between tetravalent uranium and DOTP, a cyclen&#8208;derived tetraphosphonic ligand, was studied in aqueous solutions. It resulted in the eventual formation of two new different homo&#8208;nuclear species, [U&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;(DOTPH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)] and [U&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;(DOTPH&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]. Various analytical techniques showed that a pH&#8208;dependent, reversible and irreversible oligomerization processes govern both species in&#8208;solution dynamics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two new aqueous U&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; complexes were synthesized by the interaction between the tetravalent uranium cation and the (&lt;i&gt;1,4,7,10&#8208;Tetraazacyclododecane&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetra(methylene phosphonic acid)&lt;/i&gt; (DOTP) macrocyclic ligand. Two distinct homonuclear complexes were identified; the first was characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography as a unique &#8220;out&#8208;of&#8208;cage&#8221;, [U(DOTPH&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] complex, in which the U&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; cation is octa&#8208;coordinated to 4 phosphonic arms from each ligand in a square anti&#8208;prism geometry, with a &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry. The second is the &#8220;in&#8208;cage&#8221; [U(DOTPH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)] complex, in which the tetravalent cation is located between the macrocycle O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; planes. With the help of UV&#8208;Vis absorption, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H/&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P&#8197;NMR, ATR&#8208;IR, and MALDI&#8208;TOFMS analytical techniques, the chemical interchange between both species is presented. It is shown that the one&#8208;way transition is governed by the formation of a multiple number of soluble oligomeric species consisting of varied stoichiometric ratios of both characterized homonuclear complexes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>DNA&#8208;Scaffolded Disulfide Redox Network for Programming Drug&#8208;Delivery Kinetics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Opening the therapeutic window wider: An in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated DNA&#8208;scaffolded disulfide redox network (DdiSRN) can be used as a smart drug&#8208;delivery system. Drug release can be controlled and drug&#8208;delivery kinetics programmed by using DNA scaffolds for precise control over the position and number of disulfide bonds. As a therapeutic platform, this DdiSRN shows greatly enhanced therapeutic efficacy in cancer therapy.







Abstract
In response to specific stimuli, dynamic covalent materials enable the generation of new structures by reversibly forming/breaking chemical bonds, thus showing great potential for application in controlled drug release. However, using dynamic covalent chemistry to program drug&#8208;delivery kinetics remains challenging. Herein, an in&#8197;situ polymerization&#8208;generated DNA&#8208;scaffolded disulfide redox network (DdiSRN) is reported in which nucleic acids are used as a scaffold for dynamic disulfide bonds. The constructed DdiSRN allows selective release of loading cargos inside cancer cells in response to redox stimuli. Moreover, the density of disulfide bonds in network can be tuned by precise control over their position and number on DNA scaffolds. As a result, drug&#8208;delivery kinetics can be programmed with a half&#8208;life, t1/2, decreasing from 8.3 to 4.4&#8197;h, thus facilitating keeping an adequate drug concentration within the therapeutic window. Both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo studies confirm that co&#8208;delivery of DOX and siRNA in combination with fast drug release inside cells using this DdiSRN enhances the therapeutic effect on multidrug&#8208;resistant cancer. This nontrivial therapeutic platform enabling kinetic control provides a good paradigm for precision cancer medicine.

         <title>Nickel/Cobalt Molybdate Hollow Rods Induced by Structure and Defect Engineering as Exceptional Electrode Materials for Hybrid Supercapacitor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow nickel/cobalt molybdate rods with O&#8208;defects are engineered and prepared through a facile soft&#8208;template combined with partial reduction methods. The electrode material shows exceptional specific capacitance of 1329&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1, and the capacitance retention of the D&#8722;H&#8722;NiMoO4@CoMoO4 is about 95.8&#8201;% along with the cycle number of 3000. Besides, the as&#8208;prepared D&#8722;H&#8722;NiMoO4@CoMoO4//AC exhibits an exceptional energy density (34.13&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1).







Abstract
Oxygen defects and hollow structures positively impact pseudocapacitive properties of diffusion/surface&#8208;controlled processes, a component of critical importance when building high&#8208;performance supercapacitors. Hence, we fabricated hollow nickel/cobalt molybdate rods with O&#8208;defects (D&#8722;H&#8722;NiMoO4@CoMoO4) through a soft&#8208;template and partial reduction method, enhancing D&#8722;H&#8722;NiMoO4@CoMoO4&#8217;s electrochemical performance, yielding a specific capacitance of 1329&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1, and demonstrating excellent durability with 95.8&#8201;% capacity retention after 3000&#8197;cycles. D&#8722;H&#8722;NiMoO4@CoMoO4 was used as the positive electrode to construct an asymmetric supercapacitor, displaying an energy density of up to 34.13&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and demonstrating good predisposition towards practical applications. This work presents an effective approach to fabricate and use hollow nickel/cobalt molybdate rods with O&#8208;defects as pseudocapacitor material for high&#8208;performance capacitive energy storage devices.

         <title>DNA Functionality with Photoswitchable Hydrazone Cytidine**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of hydrazone&#8208;modified cytidine phosphoramidite and oligodeoxynucleotides containing this modification is presented. The E&#8208;Z isomerization triggered by the irradiation of a 450&#8197;nm blue light was investigated in the contexts of both nucleoside and oligodeoxynucleotide. The control of DNA synthesis in&#8197;vitro was achieved by using the blue light in the primer extension reactions in the presence of DNA polymerases.







Abstract
A new family of hydrazone modified cytidine phosphoramidite building block was synthesized and incorporated into oligodeoxynucleotides to construct photoswitchable DNA strands. The E&#8208;Z isomerization triggered by the irradiation of blue light with a wavelength of 450&#8197;nm was investigated and confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy and HPLC in the contexts of both nucleoside and oligodeoxynucleotide. The light activated Z form isomer of this hydrazone&#8208;cytidine with a six&#8208;member intramolecular hydrogen bond was found to inhibit DNA synthesis in the primer extension model by using Bst DNA polymerase. In addition, the hydrazone modification caused the misincorporation of dATP together with dGTP into the growing DNA strand with similar selectivity, highlighting a potential G to A mutation. This work provides a novel functional DNA building block and an additional molecular tool that has potential chemical biology and biomedicinal applications to control DNA synthesis and DNA&#8208;enzyme interactions using the cell friendly blue light irradiation.

         <title>Conjugated Molecular Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic efforts to bend aromatic surfaces have had a remarkable evolution during the last dozen years. Conjugated nanorings and nanobelts are among the most well&#8208;known examples. However, this progress has also led to the synthesis of molecular compounds with permanent tubular shapes with radial and axial &#960; surfaces, which are the highlight of this Minireview.







Abstract
Molecular compounds with permanent tubular architectures displaying radial &#960;&#8208;conjugation are exceedingly rare. Their radial and axial delocalization presents them with unique optical and electronic properties, such as remarkable tuning of their Stokes shifts, and redox switching between global and local aromaticity. Although these tubular compounds display large internal void spaces, these attributes have not been extensively explored, thus presenting future opportunities in the development of materials. By using cutting&#8208;edge synthetic methodologies to bend aromatic surfaces, large opportunities in synthesis, property discovery, and applications are expected in new members of this family of conjugated molecular nanotubes.

         <title>&#8220;Snapshot&#8221; Trapping of Multiple Transient Azolyllithiums in Batch</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent developments in flow microreactor technology have allowed the use of transient organolithium compounds that cannot be realized in a batch reactor. However, trapping of the transient heteroaryllithiums in &#8220;halogen dance&#8221; is still challenging. We report trapping of such short&#8208;lived azolyllithiums in a batch reactor by developing a finely tuned in situ zincation using zinc halide diamine complexes, whose reaction rate is controlled by the appropriate choice of the diamine ligand. The reaction is operationally simple and can be performed at 0 &#176;C with high reproducibility on a multi&#8208;gram scale. This method was applicable to a wide range of brominated azoles allowing for deprotonative functionalization, which was used for the concise divergent syntheses of both constitutional isomers of biologically active azoles.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;assembly of Amphiphilic Porphyrins to Construct Nanoparticles for Highly Efficient Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrophobic photosensitizers greatly affect the cell permeability and enrichment in tumours. They cannot be used directly for clinical applications because they always reunite in water, preventing their circulation in the blood and accumulation in tumour cells. As a result, amphiphilic photosensitizers are highly desirable. Although nanomaterial&#8208;based photosensitizers can solve water solubility, they have disadvantages of complicated operation, poor reproducibility, low drug loading, and poor stability. In this work, we propose an efficient synthesis strategy that converts small molecules into nanoparticles in 100% aqueous solution via the molecular assemble without addition of any foreign species. Three photosensitizers with triphenylphosphine units and different lengths of ethylene glycol chains are synthesized as TPP&#8208;PPh  3  , TPP&#8208;PPh  3  &#8208;2PEG and TPP&#8208;PPh  3  &#8208;4PEG to improve amphiphilicity. Among of three photosensitizers, TPP&#8208;PPh3&#8208;4PEG is the most efficient (singlet oxygen yield: 0.89) for tumour photodynamic therapy not only because of its definite constituent, but also because its amphiphilic structure allows it to self&#8208;assemble in water.</dc:description>

         <title>Spectroscopic and molecular docking study of the interaction between neutral Re(I) tetrazolate complexes and bovine serum albumin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Re(I) complexes have potential in biomedical sciences as imaging agents, diagnostics and therapeutics. Thus, it is crucial to understand how Re(I) complexes interact with carrier proteins, like serum albumins. Here, we used two neutral Re(I) complexes (  fac  &#8208;[Re(CO)  3  (1,10&#8208;phenanthroline)L], where L is either 4&#8208;cyanophenyltetrazolate  (1)  or 4&#8208;methoxycarbonylphenyltetrazole ester  (2)  , to study the interactions with bovine serum albumin (BSA). Spectroscopic measurements, calculations of thermodynamic and F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer parameters, as well as molecular modelling were performed to study differential binding between BSA and complex  1  and  2  . Induced&#8208;fit docking combined with quantum&#8208;polarised ligand docking were employed in what is believed to be a first for a Re(I) complex as a ligand for BSA. Our findings provide a basis for other molecular interaction studies and suggest that subtle functional group alterations at the terminal region of the Re(I) complex have a significant impact on the ability of this class of compounds to interact with BSA; which is important for the functional design of Re(I) complexes in biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Extended Enolates: Versatile Intermediates for Asymmetric C&#8208;H Functionalization via Noncovalent Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalyst&#8208;controlled functionalization of unmodified carbonyl compounds is a relevant operation in organic synthesis, especially when high levels of site&#8208; and stereoselectivity can be attained. This objective is now within reach for some subsets of enolizable substrates using various types of activation mechanisms. Recent contributions to this area include enantioselective transformations that proceed via transiently generated noncovalent di(tri)enolate&#8208;catalyst coordination species. While relatively easier to form than simple enolate congeners, di(tri)enolates are ambifunctional in nature and so control of the reaction regioselectivity becomes an issue. This Minireview discusses in some detail this and other problems, and how noncovalent activation approaches based on metallic and metal free catalysts have been developed to advance the field.</dc:description>

         <title>3D Uranyl Organic Frameworks Supported by Rigid Octadentate Carboxylate Ligand: Synthesis, Structure Diversity, and Luminescence Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Seven 3D uranyl organic frameworks have been hydrothermally prepared using a rigid octadentate carboxylate linker. These UOFs have diverse 3D self&#8208;assembled architectures as a function of pH, co&#8208;ligands, structure&#8208;directing agents and transition metals.







Abstract
Seven three dimensional (3D) uranyl organic frameworks (UOFs), formulated as [NH4][(UO2)3(HTTDS)(H2O)] (1), [(UO2)4(HTTDS)2](HIM)6 (2, IM=imidazole), [(UO2)4(TTDS)(H2O)2(Phen)2] (3, Phen=1,10&#8208;phenanthroline), [Zn(H2O)4]0.5[(UO2)3(HTTDS)(H2O)4] (4), and {(UO2)2[Zn(H2O)3]2(TTDS)} (5), {Zn(UO2)2(H2O)(Dib)0.5(HDib)(HTTDS)} (6, Dib=1,4&#8208;di(1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)benzene) and [Na]{(UO2)4[Cu3(u3&#8208;OH)(H2O)7](TTDS)2} (7) have been hydrothermally prepared using a rigid octadentate carboxylate ligand, tetrakis(3,5&#8208;dicarboxyphenyl)silicon(H8TTDS). These UOFs have different 3D self&#8208;assembled structures as a function of co&#8208;ligands, structure&#8208;directing agents and transition metals. The structure of 1 has an infinite ribbon formed by the UO7 pentagonal bipyramid bridged by carboxylate groups. With further introduction of auxiliary N&#8208;donor ligands, different structure of 2 and 3 are formed, in 2 the imidazole serves as space filler, while in 3 the Phen are bound to [UO2]2+ units as co&#8208;ligands. The second metal centers were introduced in the syntheses of 4&#8211;7, and in all cases, they are part of the final structures, either as a counterion (4) or as a component of framework (5&#8722;7). Interesting, in 7, a rare polyoxometalate [Cu3(&#956;3&#8208;OH)O7(O2CR)4] cluster was found in the structure. It acts as an inorganic building unit together with the dimer [(UO2)2(O2CR)4] unit. Those uranyl carboxylates were sufficiently determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, and their topological structures and luminescence properties were analyzed in detail.

         <title>Isolation of an Antiaromatic 9&#8208;Hydroxy Fluorenyl Cation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surprisingly stable after all: Attempts to prepare a m&#8208;terphenylacylium ion by fluoride abstraction from a benzoyl fluoride, gave rise to a 4&#960;&#8208;electron antiaromatic 9&#8208;hydroxy fluorenyl cation that formed via an intramolecular electrophilic attack at a flanking mesityl group prior to a 1,2&#8208;methyl shift and proton transfer to oxygen.







Abstract
Fluorenyl cations are textbook examples of 4&#960; electron antiaromatic five&#8208;membered ring systems. So far, they were reported only as short&#8208;lived intermediates generated under superacidic conditions or by flash photolysis. Attempts to prepare a m&#8208;terphenyl acylium cation by fluoride abstraction from a benzoyl fluoride gave rise to an isolable 9&#8208;hydroxy fluorenyl cation that formed by an intramolecular electrophilic attack at a flanking mesityl group prior to a 1,2&#8208;methyl shift and proton transfer to oxygen.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Hydrosilylation of Ketenes with Silicon Electrophiles: Access to Fully Substituted Aldehyde&#8208;Derived Silyl Enol Ethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#946;,&#946;&#8208;Di&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;monoaryl&#8208;substituted silyl enol ethers derived from aldehydes are difficult to prepare. This rare class of compounds has been made accessible by a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free hydrosilylation of ketenes with B(C6F5)3 as catalyst and Et3SiH as stoichiometric reductant. The substrate scope is decent, and the stereoselectivity moderate to good in selected cases.







Abstract
Little&#8208;explored hydrosilylation of ketenes promoted by main&#8208;group catalysts is reported. The boron Lewis acid tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane accelerates the slow uncatalyzed reaction of ketenes and hydrosilanes, thereby providing a convenient access to the new class of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;di&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;monoaryl&#8208;substituted aldehyde&#8208;derived silyl enol ethers. Yields are moderate to high, and Z configuration is preferred. The corresponding silyl bis&#8208;enol ethers are also available when using dihydrosilanes. The related trityl&#8208;cation&#8208;initiated hydrosilylation involving self&#8208;regeneration of silylium ions is far less effective.

         <title>Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Borylation of Aryl Sulfoxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel/N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalytic system has been developed for the borylation of aryl sulfoxides with B2(neop)2 (neop=neopentyl glycolato). A wide range of aryl sulfoxides with different electronic and steric properties were converted into the corresponding arylboronic esters in good yields. Elucidation of key mechanistic features of this newly developed reaction led to the identification of fully characterized nickel intermediates.







Abstract
A nickel/N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalytic system has been developed for the borylation of aryl sulfoxides with B2(neop)2 (neop=neopentyl glycolato). A wide range of aryl sulfoxides with different electronic and steric properties were converted into the corresponding arylboronic esters in good yields. The regioselective borylation of unsymmetric diaryl sulfoxides was also feasible leading to borylation of the sterically less encumbered aryl substituent. Competition experiments demonstrated that an electron&#8208;deficient aryl moiety reacts preferentially. The origin of the selectivity in the Ni&#8208;catalyzed borylation of electronically biased unsymmetrical diaryl sulfoxide lies in the oxidative addition step of the catalytic cycle, as oxidative addition of methoxyphenyl 4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)phenyl sulfoxide to the Ni(0) complex occurs selectively to give the structurally characterized complex trans&#8208;[Ni(ICy)2(4&#8208;CF3&#8208;C6H4){(SO)&#8208;4&#8208;MeO&#8208;C6H4}] 4. For complex 5, the isomer trans&#8208;[Ni(ICy)2(C6H5)(OSC6H5)] 5&#8208;I was structurally characterized in which the phenyl sulfinyl ligand is bound via the oxygen atom to nickel. In solution, the complex trans&#8208;[Ni(ICy)2(C6H5)(OSC6H5)] 5&#8208;I is in equilibrium with the S&#8208;bonded isomer trans&#8208;[Ni(ICy)2(C6H5)(SOC6H5)] 5, as shown by NMR spectroscopy. DFT calculations reveal that these isomers are separated by a mere 0.3&#8197;kJ/mol (M06/def2&#8208;TZVP&#8208;level of theory) and connected via a transition state trans&#8208;[Ni(ICy)2(C6H5)(&#951;2&#8208;{SO}&#8208;C6H5)], which lies only 10.8&#8197;kcal/mol above 5.

         <title>Molecular Tools for the Study of ADP&#8208;Ribosylation: A Unified and Versatile Method to Synthesise Native Mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;Ribosylated Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides: A universal approach to synthesise mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides is presented. These peptides can provide a valuable tool for studying ADP&#8208;ribosylation. This is demonstrated by the synthesis of a variety of ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides modified on Ser&#8208;, Thr&#8208; or Cys&#8208;residues, the latter of which can act as a stable isostere for Ser&#8208;ADPr as Cys&#8208;ADPr is not reversed by the Ser&#8208;ADPr hydrolase ARH3. Furthermore, in using these peptides, the first hydrolase capable of hydrolysing Cys&#8208;ADPr was identified.







Abstract
ADP&#8208;ribosylation (ADPr), as a post&#8208;translational modification, plays a crucial role in DNA&#8208;repair, immunity and many other cellular and physiological processes. Serine is the main acceptor for ADPr in DNA damage response, whereas the physiological impact of less common ADPr&#8208;modifications of cysteine and threonine side chains is less clear. Generally, gaining molecular insights into ADPr recognition and turn&#8208;over is hampered by the availability of homogeneous, ADP&#8208;ribosylated material, such as mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated (MARylated) peptides. Here, a new and efficient solid&#8208;phase strategy for the synthesis of Ser&#8208;, Thr&#8208; and Cys&#8208;MARylated peptides is described. ADP&#8208;ribosylated cysteine, apart from being a native post&#8208;translational modification in its own right, proved to be suitable as a stabile bioisostere for ADP&#8208;ribosylated serine making it a useful tool to further biochemical research on serine ADP&#8208;ribosylation. In addition, it was discovered that the Streptococcus pyogenes encoded protein, SpyMacroD, acts as a Cys&#8208;(ADP&#8208;ribosyl) hydrolase.

         <title>Asymmetric Catalytic Approach to Multilayer 3D Chirality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first asymmetric catalytic approach to multilayer 3D chirality by using Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;couplings in the presence of new chiral amide&#8208;phosphines is reported. The resulting multilayer products showed strong luminescence under UV irradiation, and displayed strong aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE).







Abstract
The first asymmetric catalytic approach to multilayer 3D chirality has been achieved by using Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;couplings. New chiral catalysts were designed and screened under various catalytic systems that proved chiral amide&#8208;phosphines to be more efficient ligands than other candidates. The multilayer 3D framework was unambiguously determined by X&#8208;ray structural analysis showing a parallel pattern of three layers consisting of top, middle and bottom aromatic rings. The X&#8208;ray structure of a catalyst complex, dichloride complex of Pd&#8208;phosphine amide, was obtained revealing an interesting asymmetric environment nearby the Pd metal center. Three rings of multilayer 3D products can be readily changed by varying aromatic ring&#8208;anchored starting materials. The resulting multilayer products displayed strong luminescence under UV irradiation and strong aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE). In the future, this work would benefit not only the field of asymmetric synthesis but also materials science, in particular polarized organic electronics, optoelectronics and photovoltaics.

         <title>Reaction Mechanisms of the Degradation of Fluoroethylene Carbonate, an Additive of Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries, Unraveled by Radiation Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Forming an attachment: In neat fluoroethylene carbonate, an additive commonly used in lithium&#8208;ion batteries, excess electrons formed upon radiolysis primarly undergo attachment rather than solvation. The formation of the cyclic radical anion is not observed when fluoroethylene carbonate is a solute in other solvents.







Abstract
Numerous additives are used in the electrolytes of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, especially for the formation of an efficient solid electrolyte interphase at the surface of the electrodes. Understanding the degradation processes of these compounds is thus important; they can be seen through radiolysis. In the case of fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), picosecond pulse radiolysis experiments evidenced the formation of FEC.&#8722;. This radical is stabilized in neat FEC, whereas the ring opens to form more stable radical anions when FEC is a solute in other solvents, as confirmed by quantum chemistry calculations. In neat FEC, pre&#8208;solvated electrons primarily undergo attachment rather than solvation. On long timescales, the gases produced (H2, CO, and CO2) were quantified. A reaction scheme for both the oxidizing and reducing pathways at stake in irradiated FEC is proposed. This work shows that the nature of the primary species formed in FEC depends on the amount of FEC in the solution.

         <title>Chiral Gold(III) Complexes: Synthesis, Structure, and Potential Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Golden story: Recent progresses achieved in the synthesis of well&#8208;defined chiral gold(III) complexes have been summarized. Applications that encompass homogeneous catalysis, medicinal and material chemistry, are also described.







Abstract
Since the beginning of the 2000&#8217;s, homogeneous gold catalysis has emerged as a powerful tool to promote the cyclization of unsaturated substrates with excellent regioselectivity allowing the synthesis of elaborated organic scaffolds. An important goal to achieve in gold catalysis is the possibility to induce enantioselective transformations by the assistance of chiral complexes. Unfortunately, the linear geometry of coordination for gold usually encountered in complexes at the +1 oxidation states renders this goal very challenging. In consequence, the interest toward the synthesis of chiral gold(III) complexes is steadily growing. Indeed, the square planar geometry of the gold(III) cation appears more suitable to promote chiral induction. Beside catalysis, gold(III) complexes have also shown promising potential in the field of pharmacology. Herein, syntheses and applications of well&#8208;defined gold(III) complexes reported over the last fifteen years are summarized.

While electrostatics is strongly stabilizing component in the conventional C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X bonds where X is an electronegative main group element, it is destabilizing in the C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;M contacts when M is Au(I), Ag(I), or Cu(I) of NHC&#8722;M&#8722;Cl systems. Such remarkable C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;M interaction became experimentally accessible within (&#945;&#8208;ICyDMe)MCl, NHC&#8208;Metal complexes embedded into cyclodextrins. Computational analysis of the model systems suggests that the overall interaction energies are relatively insensitive to moderate variations in the directionality of interaction between a C&#8722;H bond and the metal center, indicating stereoelectronic promiscuity of fully filled set of d&#8208;orbitals. A combination of experimental and computational data demonstrates that metal encapsulation inside the cyclodextrin cavity forces the C&#8722;H bond to point toward the metal, and reveals a still attractive &#8220;contra&#8208;electrostatic&#8221; H&#8208;bonding interaction.

         <title>Iridium Complex of N&#8208;Fused Bilatrienone: Oxidative Cleavage of N&#8208;Fused Porphyrin Induced by Iridium&#8208;Cyclooctadiene Complexation</title>

Metalation&#8208;assisted oxidative degradation: Reaction of N&#8208;fused porphyrin with iridium&#8208;cyclooctadiene under aerobic conditions yielded a unique ring&#8208;opened N&#8208;fused bilatrienone analog. The resulting species was isolated as an octahedral iridium complex with significantly modified optical and electrochemical properties.







Abstract
N&#8208;fused porphyrin (NFP) is a unique class of photostable near&#8208;infrared dyes with an 18&#960; aromatic tetrapyrrole macrocyclic skeleton containing a tri&#8208;fused pentacyclic moiety. Here, the synthesis of an iridium complex of N&#8208;fused bilatrienone is reported as the degradation product of Ir&#8208;cyclooctadiene (cod)&#8208;induced oxidative cleavage of NFP under aerobic conditions. Similar to the native bilin chromophores, the ring&#8208;opened complex featured a broken &#960;&#8208;conjugation circuit and exhibited a broad visible absorption band. In contrast, metalation of NFP using an iridium(I)(cod) complex under an inert atmosphere resulted in the formation of a cod&#8208;isomerized (&#954;1,&#951;3&#8208;C8H12)&#8208;Ir complex.

Here, the synthesis of an iridium complex of N&#8208;fused bilatrienone is reported as the degradation product of Ir&#8208;cyclooctadiene (cod)&#8208;induced oxidative cleavage of NFP under aerobic conditions. Similar to the native bilin chromophores, the ring&#8208;opened complex featured a broken &#960;&#8208;conjugation circuit and exhibited a broad visible absorption band. In contrast, metalation of NFP using an iridium(I)(cod) complex under an inert atmosphere resulted in the formation of a cod&#8208;isomerized (&#954;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;,&#951;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;)&#8208;Ir complex.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Reversible Vapochromic Luminescence Accompanied by Planar&#8211;Half&#8208;Chair Conformational Change of a Propeller&#8208;Shaped Boron &#946;&#8208;Diketiminate Complex</title>

         <dc:description>Leakage of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is one of the most severe industrial accidents because it can cause environmental pollution, global warming, fire, and explosion. Hence the visualization of leakage is an essential technology to detect it at an early stage. Molecular crystals whose fluorescence color can be changed by the exposure to VOCs could potentially serve as the sensing materials for realizing rapid and facile VOC detection. These materials, however, usually require harsh conditions, such as heating or a vacuum, to recover their initial phases for reuse. Therefore, it remains a challenge to obtain completely reversible sensing systems without such energy&#8208;consuming recycling processes. Here we report the reversible color change of fluorescence from the crystals of a propeller&#8208;shaped boron  &#946;&#8208;diketiminate complex. The complex was crystallized in distinct crystalline phases having different luminescent colors. Importantly, these phases were interconverted repeatedly upon exposure to the vapors of the appropriate VOCs. The small energy differences between conformers of the complex could lead to this pseudopolymorphic behavior. This finding could be applied for the development of further eco&#8208;friendly reversible sensing materials based on four&#8208;coordinated boron complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>The Long and Bright Path of a Lanthanide MOF: From Basics towards the Application</title>

A Tb&#8208;based&#8208;MOF modified cotton for implementation into a fluoride sensor has been synthesized and characterized. The study is divided in three sections, the first one is devoted to the characterization of the MOF deposited on the cotton, the second to the structural and spectroscopic behavior of the MOF in contact with water and fluoride aqueous solutions and the third to the construction of a tech demo of a fluoride sensor.







Abstract
The development of portable, reliable, and low&#8208;cost sensors for assessing the quality of natural water sources is of high relevance in developing countries as they can serve as an intermediate solution prior to the building of permanent potable water distribution infrastructure. These sensors should be simple to operate by non&#8208;trained operators and easy to manufacture locally. Lanthanide&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) offer a trustable platform due to their intense emission in regions of the visible spectra and their high sensitivity to fluorides in water. Cotton was chosen as a substrate due to its high hydrophilicity which, together with the highly porous nature of the MOF, allows for shorter reaction times. The modified cotton was characterized by XRD, SEM as well as XAFS, hence probing the presence of [Tb(BTC)6(H2O)] (Tb&#8208;BTC) attachment to cotton. Changes in the emission when Tb&#8208;BTC modified cotton was exposed to water and aqueous fluoride solutions were monitored as a function of time. Crystalline phase changes were identified that correlated to structural information. Finally, the Tb&#8208;BTC modified cotton was used to build a fluoride demonstrator sensor with a linear response of up to 10&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 and a limit of detection of 0.8&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1, making it suitable for drinking water analysis under international regulations.

Fit in the groove: Hybrid DNAs with Watson&#8211;Crick and purine&#8211;purine base pairs decorated with dendritic side chains are prepared. Space&#8208;demanding side chains introduced into the 7&#8208;position of 5&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deazaguanine&#8211;isoguanine base pairs are well accommodated in the large groove of purine&#8211;purine DNA and have a positive impact on helix stability.







Abstract
The Watson&#8211;Crick coding system depends on the molecular recognition of complementary purine and pyrimidine bases. Now, the construction of hybrid DNAs with Watson&#8211;Crick and purine&#8211;purine base pairs decorated with dendritic side chains was performed. Oligonucleotides with single and multiple incorporations of 5&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deaza&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyguanosine, its tripropargylamine derivative, and 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyisoguanosine were synthesized. Duplex stability decreased if single modified purine&#8211;purine base pairs were inserted, but increased if pyrene residues were introduced by click chemistry. A growing number of consecutive 5&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deazaguanine&#8211;isoguanine base pairs led to strong stepwise duplex stabilization, a phenomenon not observed for the guanine&#8211;isoguanine base pair. Spacious residues are well accommodated in the large groove of purine&#8211;purine DNA tracts. Changes to the global helical structure monitored by circular dichroism spectroscopy show the impact of functionalization to the global double&#8208;helix structure. This study explores new areas of molecular recognition realized by purine base pairs that are complementary in hydrogen bonding, but not in size, relative to canonical pairs.

Exploring elementary reactions: Cationic zinc hydrides are successfully probed for CO2 reduction. The mechanistic pathways operative in cationic zinc hydride catalyzed hydrosilylation and hydroboration are established through experiments and computations. The coordination number at zinc and secondary Lewis acid dictate the efficacy.







Abstract
Zinc has been an element of choice for carbon dioxide reduction in recent years. Zinc compounds have been showcased as catalysts for carbon dioxide hydrosilylation and hydroboration. The extent of carbon dioxide reduction can depend on various factors, including electrophilicity at the zinc center and the denticity of the ancillary ligands. In a few cases, the addition of Lewis acids to zinc hydride catalysts markedly influences carbon dioxide reduction. These factors have been investigated by exploring elementary reactions of carbon dioxide hydrosilylation and hydroboration by using cationic zinc hydrides bearing tetradentate tris[2&#8208;(dimethylamino)ethyl]amine and tridentate N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;pentamethyldiethylenetriamine in the presence of triphenylborane and tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane.

Bioelectronics: Processing of additive&#8208;free aqueous dispersions of 2D materials like transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride is demonstrated, and biological implications like cell compatibility and enzymatic degradability are investigated.







Abstract
Water&#8208;dispersible two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials are desirable for diverse applications. Aqueous dispersions make processing safer and greener and enable evaluation of these materials on biological and environmental fronts. To evaluate the effects of 2D materials with biological systems, obtaining dispersions without additives is critical and has been a challenge. Herein, a method was developed for obtaining additive&#8208;free aqueous dispersions of 2D materials like transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN). The nanosheet dispersions were investigated through spectroscopic and microscopic methods, along with the role of size on stability. The aqueous media enabled investigations on cytocompatibility and enzymatic degradation of molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) and h&#8208;BN. Cytocompatibility with mixed glial cells was observed up to concentrations of 100&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1, suggesting their plausible usage in bioelectronics. Besides, biodegradation using human myeloperoxidase (hMPO) mediated catalysis was investigated through Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopy. The findings suggested that additive&#8208;free 2H&#8208;MoS2 and h&#8208;BN were degradable by hMPO, with 2H&#8208;phase exhibiting better resistance to degradation than the 1T&#8208;phase, while h&#8208;BN exhibited slower degradation. The findings pave a path for incorporating 2D materials in the burgeoning field of transient bioelectronics.

         <title>Transmembrane Transport of Bicarbonate Unravelled**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 26, Page 7367-7375, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new assay to study bicarbonate transport is reported, which is based on a europium complex that is encapsulated inside liposomes and reports changes in the intravesicular concentration of bicarbonate in a direct and highly sensitive way. This assay was used to reveal that synthetic anion transporters can act via different mechanisms: 1) actual transport of HCO3&#8722; anions; 2) CO2 diffusion coupled to dissipation of the resulting transmembrane pH gradient.







Abstract
Anion receptors can be used to transport ions across lipid bilayers, which has potential for therapeutic applications. Synthetic bicarbonate transporters are of particular interest, as defects in transmembrane transport of bicarbonate are associated with various diseases. However, no convenient method exists to directly observe bicarbonate transport and study the mechanisms involved. Here, an assay is presented that allows the kinetics of bicarbonate transport into liposomes to be monitored directly and with great sensitivity. The assay utilises an encapsulated europium(III) complex, which exhibits a large increase in emission intensity upon binding bicarbonate. Mechanisms involving CO2 diffusion and the dissipation of a pH gradient are shown to be able to lead to an increase in bicarbonate concentration within liposomes, without transport of the anion occurring at all. By distinguishing these alternative mechanisms from actual bicarbonate transport, this assay will inform the future development of bicarbonate transporters.

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Investigation of the Structural and Opto&#8208;electronic Properties of Fe&#8208;Doped Lead&#8208;Free Cs2AgBiCl6 Double Perovskite</title>

Doubling up: The synthesis and first&#8208;principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations of Fe&#8208;doped, lead&#8208;free dipyramidal shape Cs2AgBiCl6 crystals for photodetector applications are presented. The results of systematic investigation of the crystal structure, morphology, optical properties, band structure, and stability of these materials are discussed.







Abstract
Lead&#8208;free double perovskites have emerged as stable and non&#8208;toxic alternatives to Pb&#8208;halide perovskites. Herein, the synthesis of Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 lead&#8208;free double perovskites are reported that display blue emission using an antisolvent method. The crystal structure, morphology, optical properties, band structure, and stability of the Fe&#8208;doped double perovskites were investigated systematically. Formation of the Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite is confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. XRD and thermo&#8208;gravimetric analysis (TGA) shows that the Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite has high structural and thermal stability, respectively. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE&#8208;SEM) analysis revealed the formation of dipyramidal shape Cs2AgBiCl6 crystals. Furthermore, energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping shows the overlapping of Cs, Bi, Ag, Fe, and Cl elements and homogenous incorporation of Fe in Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite. The Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite shows a strong absorption at 380&#8197;nm. It extends up to 700&#8197;nm, suggesting that sub&#8208;band gap states transition may originate from the surface defect of the doped perovskite material. The radiative kinetics of the crystals was studied using the time&#8208;correlated single&#8208;photon counting (TCSPC) technique. Lattice parameters and band gap value of the Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskites predicted by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations are confirmed by XRD and UV/Visible spectroscopy analysis. Time&#8208;dependent photo&#8208;response characteristics of the Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite show fast response and recovery time of charge carriers. We believe that the successful incorporation of Fe in lead&#8208;free, environmentally friendly Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite can open a new class of doped double perovskites with significant potential optoelectronics devices fabrication and photocatalytic applications.

         <title>Metal Cation Valency Dependence in Morphology Evolution of Cu2&#8722;xS Nanodisk Seeds and Their Pseudomorphic Cation Exchanges</title>

Tin cation valency&#8208;dependent morphology evolution of Cu2&#8722;xS nanodisk seeds was initially developed. Subsequent pseudomorphic full/partial cation exchanges with Zn2+ and Cd2+ to produce traditionally inaccessible nanostructures were reported as well.







Abstract
A crucial parameter in the design of semiconductor nanoparticles (NPs) with controllable optical, magnetic, electronic, and catalytic properties is the morphology. Herein, we demonstrate the potential of additive metal cations with variable valency to direct the morphology evolution of copper&#8208;deficient Cu2&#8722;xS nanoparticles in the process of seed&#8208;mediated growth. In particular, the djurleite Cu1.94S seed could evolve from disk into tetradecahedron in the presence of tin(IV) cations, whereas they merely formed sharp hexagonal nanodisks with tin(II) cations. In addition to djurleite Cu1.94S, the tin(IV) cations could be generalized to direct the growth of roxbyite Cu1.8S and covellite CuS nanodisk seeds into tetradecahedra. We further perform pseudomorphic cation exchanges of Cu1.94S tetradecahedra with Zn2+ and Cd2+ to produce polyhedral zinc sulfide (ZnS) and cadmium sulfide (CdS) NPs. Moreover, we achieve Cu1.8S/ZnS and Cu1.94S/CdS tetradecahedral heterostructures via partial cation exchange, which are otherwise inaccessible by traditional synthetic approaches.

Multitasking! Fourteen new Ru&#8211;arene (p&#8208;cymene or benzene) complexes bearing different furoylthiourea ligands have been synthesized and characterized. All the complexes were found to be highly toxic towards IMR&#8208;32 cancer cells. The complexes catalytically oxidized glutathione and promoted cell death by apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. They also showed good binding ability with receptors commonly overexpressed in cancer cells.







Abstract
Fourteen new RuII&#8211;arene (p&#8208;cymene/benzene) complexes (C1&#8211;C14) have been synthesized by varying the N&#8208;terminal substituent in the furoylthiourea ligand and satisfactorily characterized by using analytical and spectroscopic techniques. Electrostatic potential maps predicted that the electronic effect of the substituents was mostly localized, with some influence seen on the labile chloride ligands. The structure&#8211;activity relationships of the Ru&#8211;p&#8208;cymene and Ru&#8211;benzene complexes showed opposite trends. All the complexes were found to be highly toxic towards IMR&#8208;32 cancer cells, with C5 (Ru&#8211;p&#8208;cymene complex containing C6H2(CH3)3 as N&#8208;terminal substituent) and C13 (Ru&#8211;benzene complex containing C6H4(CF3) as N&#8208;terminal substituent) showing the highest activity among each set of complexes, and hence they were chosen for further study. These complexes showed different behavior in aqueous solutions, and were also found to catalytically oxidize glutathione. They also promoted cell death by apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, the complexes showed good binding ability with the receptors Pim&#8208;1 kinase and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, commonly overexpressed in cancer cells.

         <title>Specific Ion&#8211;Protein Interactions Influence Bacterial Ice Nucleation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 26, Page 7402-7407, May 6, 2021. </description>

Effects of ions on bacterial ice nucleation: Freezing droplet experiments, sum&#8208;frequency generation spectroscopy, and molecular dynamic simulations were used to demonstrate that ions can profoundly influence the efficiency of bacterial ice nucleators in a manner that follows the Hofmeister series. The different effects are due to specific interactions of the ions with ice&#8208;nucleating proteins on the surface of the bacteria.







Abstract
Ice nucleation&#8208;active bacteria are the most efficient ice nucleators known, enabling the crystallization of water at temperatures close to 0&#8201;&#176;C, thereby overcoming the kinetically hindered phase transition process at these conditions. Using highly specialized ice&#8208;nucleating proteins (INPs), they can cause frost damage to plants and influence the formation of clouds and precipitation in the atmosphere. In nature, the bacteria are usually found in aqueous environments containing ions. The impact of ions on bacterial ice nucleation efficiency, however, has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that ions can profoundly influence the efficiency of bacterial ice nucleators in a manner that follows the Hofmeister series. Weakly hydrated ions inhibit bacterial ice nucleation whereas strongly hydrated ions apparently facilitate ice nucleation. Surface&#8208;specific sum&#8208;frequency generation spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the different effects are due to specific interactions of the ions with the INPs on the surface of the bacteria. Our results demonstrate that heterogeneous ice nucleation facilitated by bacteria strongly depends upon the nature of the ions, and specific ion&#8211;protein interactions are essential for the complete description of heterogeneous ice nucleation by bacteria.

         <title>New Noncentrosymmetric Tetrel Pnictides Composed of Square&#8208;Planar Gold(I) with Peculiar Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 26, Page 7383-7390, May 6, 2021. </description>

Bonding natures: Compared with common types of AuI coordination observed in extended solids, square&#8208;planar coordination is rare. Au(I)relia shows off the three&#8208;centered bonding of Au&#8722;Tt&#8722;Au and Au&#8722;Pn&#8722;Au (on her feathers; Tt=tetrel, Pn=pnictogen), square&#8208;planar cis&#8208;[AuTt2Pn2] units (her body), and linear chains of Au (her legs) that are characteristic of equiatomic AuSiAs, AuGeP, and AuGeAs compounds.







Abstract
Three novel isostructural equiatomic gold tetrel pnictides, AuSiAs, AuGeP, and AuGeAs, were synthesized and characterized. These phases crystallize in the noncentrosymmetric (NCS) monoclinic space group Cc (no. 9), featuring square&#8208;planar Au within cis&#8208;[AuTt2Pn2] units (Tt=tetrel, Si, Ge; Pn=pnictogen, P, As). This is in drastic contrast to the structure of previously reported AuSiP, which exhibits typical linear coordination of Au with Si and P. Chemical bonding analysis through the electron localization function suggests covalent two&#8208;center two&#8208;electron Tt&#8722;Pn bonds, and three&#8208;center Au&#8722;Tt&#8722;Au and Au&#8722;Pn&#8722;Au bonds with 1.6&#8197;e&#8722; per bond. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies support the covalent and nonionic nature of Au&#8722;Pn and Au&#8722;Tt bonds. The title materials were found to be n&#8208;type narrow&#8208;gap semiconductors or semimetals, with nearly temperature&#8208;independent electrical resistivities and low thermal conductivities. A combination of the semimetallic properties with tunable NCS structure provides opportunities for the development of materials based on gold tetrel pnictides.

The frontispiece shows the adaptable character of 2'&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2',2'&#8208;difluorocytidine (gemcitabine) nucleotide when incorporated into double helical structures (shown in magenta). Gemcitabine adopts a North type sugar conformation when inserted in a B&#8208;form helix (in green), as that formed by pure DNA, or a South type sugar conformation when inserted in an A&#8208;type helix (in blue), as that formed by DNA&#8201;:&#8201;RNA hybrids. A chameleon skin in the picture background metaphorically illustrates this versatility. For more information see the Communication by A. Avi&#241;&#243;, C.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 26, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hitherto overlooked group of privileged substructures, namely aromatic oligoamides, for which there are natural models in the form of cystobactamids, albicidin, distamycin A, netropsin, and others is presented. These aromatic oligoamides have been employed to inhibit protein&#8211;protein and nucleic acid&#8211;protein interactions. Read more in the Review by A. Kirschning et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;7321&#8197;ff.

Compared to common types of Au(I) coordination, such as linear, trigonal planar, and tetrahedral units observed in extended solids, the square planar coordination is rare. Au(I)relia, shown in the cover image, exhibits the 3&#8208;centered bonding of Au&#8208;Tt&#8208;Au and Au&#8208;Pn&#8208;Au (on her feathers), square planar cis&#8208;[AuTt2Pn2] units (her pendant), and linear &#8230;&#8208;Au&#8208;Au&#8208;Au&#8208;&#8230; chains (her legs) that are characteristic of the novel equiatomic AuSiAs, AuGeP, and AuGeAs compounds. The image was created by designer Grant Luhmann. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K. Kovnir et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202005312).

The dynamic structural and optical changes of Tb&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks in the presence of aqueous fluoride solutions are reported in this work. The structural transformation of the MOF in the presence of fluorides was scrutinized by XRD, XAFS, and dynamic measurements of the Tb emission, and all the information was summarized in the development of a tech&#8208;demo. The cover shows &#8220;The Great Wave off Kanagawa&#8221; hinting at the flow between the different but connected states of the MOF when the fluoride concentration increases, first increasing the emission by replacement of Tb&#8722;OH groups in the MOF by Tb&#8722;F and later quenching the emission by the formation of TbF3. The cover image was designed by ScienceBrush Design. More information can be found in the Full Paper by E.&#8197;H. Otal, M. Kimura, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202005222).

The development of synthetic bicarbonate transporters is of high interest for potential therapeutic applications. This work presents a new assay to study bicarbonate transport, based on a europium complex that is encapsulated inside liposomes and reports changes in the intravesicular concentration of bicarbonate in a direct and highly sensitive way. The assay revealed that transporters can act via different mechanisms, involving actual transport of HCO3&#8722; anions or passive diffusion of CO2. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Butler, H. Valkenier, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100491).

Cooperativity between cationic zinc hydrides and triphenylborane is utilized to catalyze CO2 reduction. Elementary reactions provide insights into a general mechanism for zinc hydride promoted CO2 hydrosilylation and hydroboration. The significance of the zinc&#8208;bound ligand denticity and the Lewis acid additive role in the catalytic process is highlighted. More information can be found in the Full Paper by L. Maron, A. Venugopal, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202005392).

         <title>Natural and Synthetic Oligoarylamides: Privileged Structures for Medical Applications</title>

Privileged! Aromatic oligoamides based on pyrroles, pyridines, and p&#8208;aminobenzoic acids are presented as privileged structures that efficiently target nucleic acids and proteins as well as complexes derived therefrom. Their design can be related to natural products such distamycin A and the cystobactamids.







Abstract
The term &#8220;privileged structure&#8221; refers to a single molecular substructure or scaffold that can serve as a starting point for high&#8208;affinity ligands for more than one receptor type. In this report, a hitherto overlooked group of privileged substructures is addressed, namely aromatic oligoamides, for which there are natural models in the form of cystobactamids, albicidin, distamycin A, netropsin, and others. The aromatic and heteroaromatic core, together with a flexible selection of substituents, form conformationally well&#8208;defined scaffolds capable of specifically binding to conformationally well&#8208;defined regions of biomacromolecules such as helices in proteins or DNA often by acting as helices mimics themselves. As such, these aromatic oligoamides have already been employed to inhibit protein&#8211;protein and nucleic acid&#8211;protein interactions. This article is the first to bring together the scattered knowledge about aromatic oligoamides in connection with biomedical applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term &#8220;privileged structure&#8221; refers to a single molecular substructure or scaffold that can serve as a starting point for high&#8208;affinity ligands for more than one receptor type. In this report, a hitherto overlooked group of privileged substructures is addressed, namely aromatic oligoamides, for which there are natural models in the form of cystobactamids, albicidin, distamycin A, netropsin, and others. The aromatic and heteroaromatic core, together with a flexible selection of substituents, form conformationally well&#8208;defined scaffolds capable of specifically binding to conformationally well&#8208;defined regions of biomacromolecules such as helices in proteins or DNA often by acting as helices mimics themselves. As such, these aromatic oligoamides have already been employed to inhibit protein&#8211;protein and nucleic acid&#8211;protein interactions. This article is the first to bring together the scattered knowledge about aromatic oligoamides in connection with biomedical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

Fighting bacterial infections: As nutrient acquisition and metabolism at the host&#8208;pathogen interface are elucidated, new drug targets continue to emerge. Metal homeostasis provides opportunities for medicinal inorganic chemists to alter or disrupt these processes selectively to impart bacteriostatic or bacteriotoxic effects. Here, we showcase some of the recent work from the field of metal&#8208;based antibacterial agents and highlight divergent strategies and mechanisms of action.







Abstract
Drug discovery aimed at the efficient eradication of life&#8208;threatening bacterial infections, especially in light of the emergence of multi&#8208;drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria, has remained a challenge for medicinal chemists over the past several decades. As nutrient acquisition and metabolism at the host&#8208;pathogen interface become better elucidated, new drug targets continue to emerge. Metal homeostasis is among these processes, and thus provides opportunities for medicinal inorganic chemists to alter or disrupt these processes selectively to impart bacteriostatic or bacteriotoxic effects. In this minireview, we showcase some of the recent work from the field of metal&#8208;based antibacterial agents and highlight divergent strategies and mechanisms of action.

         <title>Structural Effects of Incorporation of 2'&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;2'2'&#8208;Difluorodeoxycytidine (Gemcitabine) in A&#8208; and B&#8208;Form Duplexes</title>

2'&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;2',2'&#8208;difluorocytidine (gemcitabine) is an adaptable nucleotide derivative that can adopt a North type sugar conformation when inserted in pure DNA (B&#8208;form helix), or a South sugar conformation in the context of DNA&#8201;:&#8201;RNA hybrids (A&#8208;form helix).







Abstract
We report the structural effect of 2'&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2',2'&#8208;difluorocytidine (dFdC) insertions in the DNA strand of a DNA&#8201;:&#8201;RNA hybrid duplex and in a self&#8208;complementary DNA&#8201;:&#8201;DNA duplex. In both cases, the modification slightly destabilizes the duplex and provokes minor local distortions that are more pronounced in the case of the DNA&#8201;:&#8201;RNA hybrid. Analysis of the solution structures determined by NMR methods show that dFdC is an adaptable derivative that adopts North type sugar conformation when inserted in pure DNA, or a South sugar conformation in the context of DNA&#8201;:&#8201;RNA hybrids. In this latter context, South sugar pucker favors the formation of a 2'F&#8901;&#8901;H8 attractive interaction with a neighboring purine, which compensates the destabilizing effect of base pair distortions. These interactions share some features with pseudohydrogen bonds described previously in other nucleic acids structures with fluorine modified sugars.

         <title>Synthesis, Structure, and Chiroptical Properties of Indolo&#8208; and Pyridopyrrolo&#8208;Carbazole&#8208;Based C2&#8208;Symmetric Azahelicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 26, Page 7356-7361, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azahelicenes bearing an indolocarbazole backbone were prepared by a step&#8208;economic double dehydrogenative cyclization under palladium catalysis. Their optical resolutions were attained by chiral HPLC. The pyridopyrrolo derivative (X=N, R=H) was found to show ca. 6 times larger dissymmetry factors than those of the parent azahelicene (X=CH, R=H) in both CD and CPL measurements. The CPL color could be switched by addition of an acid or introduction of a donor substituent R.







Abstract
Treatment of 11,12&#8208;bis(1,1&#8217;&#8208;biphenyl&#8208;3&#8208;yl or 6&#8208;phenylpyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;substituted 11,12&#8208;dihydro&#8208;indolo[2,3&#8208;a]carbazole with an oxidizing system of Pd(II)/Ag(I) induced effective double dehydrogenative cyclization to afford the corresponding &#960;&#8208;extended azahelicenes. The optical resolutions were readily achieved by a preparative chiral HPLC. It was found that the pyridopyrrolo&#8208;carbazole&#8208;based azahelicene that contains four nitrogen atoms exhibits ca. 6 times larger dissymmetry factors both in circularly dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), |gCD| and |gCPL| values being 1.1&#215;10&#8722;2 and 4.4&#215;10&#8722;3, respectively, as compared with the parent indolocarbazole&#8208;based azahelicene. Theoretical calculations at the RI&#8208;CC2 level were employed to rationalize the observed enhanced chiroptical responses. The (chir)optical properties of the former helicene was further tuned by a protonation leading to remarkable red&#8208;shift with a considerable enhancement of the |gCPL| value.

A redox&#8208;active chiral near&#8208;infrared circularly polarized luminescent field&#8208;induced single&#8208;molecule magnet of YbIII at the solid&#8208;state was designed from the bridging of two Yb(facam)3 units with the bis(1,10&#8208;phenantro[5,6b])tetrathiafulvalene triad.







Abstract
A field&#8208;induced chiral YbIII Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet (SMM) displayed an unprecedented near&#8208;infrared circularly polarized luminescence (NIR&#8208;CPL) in the solid&#8208;state. The bridging bis(1,10&#8208;phenantro[5,6b])tetrathiafulvalene triad (L) allowed an efficient sensitization of the NIR 2F5/2&#8594;2F7/2 emission while the NIR&#8208;CPL is associated to the f&#8208;f transitions of the YbIII ion bearing chiral &#946;&#8208;diketonate derived&#8208;camphorate ancillary ligands.

         <title>A showcase of green chemistry: Sustainable synthetic approach of zirconium&#8208;based MOF materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework materials (Zr&#8208;MOFs) have more practical usage over most conventional benchmark materials and even many other MOFs due to excellent structural stability, rich coordination forms, and various active sites. However, their mass&#8208;production and application are restricted by the high&#8208;cost raw materials, complex synthesis procedures, harsh reaction conditions, and unexpected environmental impact. Based on the principles of &#8220;Green Chemistry&#8221;, considerable efforts have been devoted to breaking through the limitations, and significant progress has been made in the sustainable synthesis of Zr&#8208;MOFs over the past decade. In this review, the advancements of green raw materials and green synthesis methods in the synthesis of Zr&#8208;MOFs are reviewed, along with the corresponding drawbacks. The challenges and prospects are discussed and outlooked, expecting to provide a guidance for the acceleration of the industrialization and commercialization of Zr&#8208;based MOF.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding the Topological Landscape by a G&#8208;Column Flip of a Parallel G&#8208;Quadruplex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Canonical G&#8208;quadruplexes can adopt a variety of different topologies depending on the arrangement of propeller, lateral, or diagonal loops connecting the four G&#8208;columns. A novel intramolecular G&#8208;quadruplex structure is derived through inversion of the last G&#8208;tract of a three&#8208;layered parallel fold, associated with the transition of a single propeller into a lateral loop. The resulting (3+1) hybrid fold features three  syn&#183;anti&#183;anti&#183;anti  G&#8208;tetrads with a 3&#8217;&#8208;terminal all&#8208;  syn  G&#8208;column. Although the ability of forming a duplex stem&#8208;loop between G&#8208;tracts seems beneficial for a propeller&#8208;to&#8208;lateral loop rearrangement, unmodified G&#8208;rich sequences resist folding into the new (3+1) topology. However, refolding can be driven by the incorporation of  syn  &#8208;favoring guanosine analogs into positions of the fourth G&#8208;stretch. The presented hybrid&#8208;type G&#8208;quadruplex structure as determined by NMR may provide for an additional scaffold in quadruplex&#8208;based technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of Ligand Polarity on the Internal Dipoles and Ferroelectric Distortion in BaTiO3 Nanocubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface of BaTiO3 nanocubes covered with nonpolar oleic acid (OA) and polar tetrafluoroborate (BF4&#8722;) capping ligands, derived from atomistic modelling of neutron PDF data.







Abstract
Surface adsorbates and surrounding matrix species have been demonstrated to affect the properties of nanoscale ferroelectrics and nanoscale ferroelectric composites; potentially counteracting performance losses that can occur in small particle sizes. In this work, the effects of nonpolar oleic acid (OA) and polar tetrafluoroborate (BF4&#8722;) ligand capping on the surface of various sizes of BaTiO3 nanocubes have been investigated with combined neutron diffraction and neutron pair distribution function (PDF), density functional theory (DFT), and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) methods. The low real space PDF region provides an unobstructed view of rhombohedral (split short and long) Ti&#8722;O distances in BaTiO3 nanocubes, mimicking the well&#8208;established order&#8208;disorder local structure found in bulk BaTiO3. Interestingly, the intermediate&#8208;range order in nanocubes is found to be orthorhombic, rather than tetragonal. It is concluded that polar ligands adsorbed at BaTiO3 surfaces stabilize the correlation length scale of local rhombohedral distortions in ferroelectric nanoparticles relative to nonpolar ligands.

         <title>Selective, pH&#8208;Dependent Colorimetric and Fluorimetric Detection of Quadruplex DNA with 4&#8208;Dimethylamino(phenyl)&#8208;Substituted Berberine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The very weak fluorescence of 4&#8208;dimethylaminophenyl&#8208;substituted berberines only increases significantly if both their conformational flexibility is strongly restricted, i.&#8201;e. in viscous medium or when bound to quadruplex DNA, and the amino group is protonated at low pH. This requirement of a dual stimulation to cause a light&#8208;up effect enables the spectrometric detection of quadruplex DNA at pH&#8197;5.







Abstract
The 9&#8208; and 12&#8208;dimethylaminophenyl&#8208;substituted berberine derivatives 3&#8201;a and 3&#8201;b were readily synthesized by Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reactions and shown to be useful fluorescent probes for the optical detection of quadruplex DNA (G4&#8208;DNA). Their association with the nucleic acids was investigated by spectrometric titrations, CD and LD spectroscopy, and with DNA&#8208;melting analysis. Both ligands bind to duplex DNA by intercalation and to G4&#8208;DNA by terminal &#960; stacking. At neutral conditions, they bind with higher affinity (Kb=105&#8722;106&#8197;M&#8722;1) to representative quadruplex forming oligonucleotides 22AG, c&#8208;myc, c&#8208;kit, and a2, than to duplex calf thymus (ct) DNA (Kb=5&#8208;7&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1). At pH&#8197;5, however, the affinity of 3&#8201;a towards G4&#8208;DNA 22AG is higher (Kb=1.2&#215;106&#8197;M&#8722;1), whereas the binding constant towards ct DNA is lower (Kb=3.9&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1) than under neutral conditions. Notably, the association of the ligand with DNA results in characteristic changes of the absorption and emission properties under specific conditions, which may be used for optical DNA detection. Other than the parent berberine, the ligands do not show a noticeable increase of their very low intrinsic emission intensity upon association with DNA at neutral conditions. In contrast, a fluorescence light&#8208;up effect was observed upon association to duplex (&#934;fl=0.01) and quadruplex DNA (&#934;fl=0.04) at pH&#8197;5. This fluorimetric response to G4&#8208;DNA association in combination with the distinct, red&#8208;shifted absorption under these conditions provides a simple and conclusive optical detection of G4&#8208;DNA at lower pH.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The very weak&lt;/b&gt; fluorescence of 4&#8208;dimethylaminophenyl&#8208;substituted berberines only increases significantly if &lt;i&gt;both&lt;/i&gt; their conformational flexibility is strongly restricted, i.&#8201;e. in viscous medium or when bound to quadruplex DNA, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; the amino group is protonated at low pH. This requirement of a dual stimulation to cause a light&#8208;up effect enables the spectrometric detection of quadruplex DNA at pH&#8197;5.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 9&#8208; and 12&#8208;dimethylaminophenyl&#8208;substituted berberine derivatives &lt;b&gt;3&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt; were readily synthesized by Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reactions and shown to be useful fluorescent probes for the optical detection of quadruplex DNA (G4&#8208;DNA). Their association with the nucleic acids was investigated by spectrometric titrations, CD and LD spectroscopy, and with DNA&#8208;melting analysis. Both ligands bind to duplex DNA by intercalation and to G4&#8208;DNA by terminal &#960; stacking. At neutral conditions, they bind with higher affinity (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;=10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) to representative quadruplex forming oligonucleotides &lt;b&gt;22AG&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;c&#8208;myc&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;c&#8208;kit&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;a2&lt;/b&gt;, than to duplex calf thymus (ct) DNA (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;=5&#8208;7&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). At pH&#8197;5, however, the affinity of &lt;b&gt;3&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; towards G4&#8208;DNA &lt;b&gt;22AG&lt;/b&gt; is higher (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;=1.2&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), whereas the binding constant towards ct DNA is lower (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;=3.9&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) than under neutral conditions. Notably, the association of the ligand with DNA results in characteristic changes of the absorption and emission properties under specific conditions, which may be used for optical DNA detection. Other than the parent berberine, the ligands do not show a noticeable increase of their very low intrinsic emission intensity upon association with DNA at neutral conditions. In contrast, a fluorescence light&#8208;up effect was observed upon association to duplex (&lt;i&gt;&#934;&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Modular Toolkit of Multifunctional Block Copoly(2&#8208;oxazoline)s for the Synthesis of Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyoxazoline block copolymers offer a wide range of possibilities for application depending on their molecular structure and properties. This study introduces the huge potential of this polyoxazoline toolkit and demonstrates how tailor&#8208;made toolkit polymers can be applied in representative systems.







Abstract
Post&#8208;polymerization modification provides an elegant way to introduce chemical functionalities onto macromolecules to produce tailor&#8208;made materials with superior properties. This concept was adapted to well&#8208;defined block copolymers of the poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) family and demonstrated the large potential of these macromolecules as universal toolkit for numerous applications. Triblock copolymers with separated water&#8208;soluble, alkyne&#8208; and alkene&#8208;containing segments were synthesized and orthogonally modified with various low&#8208;molecular weight functional molecules by copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) and thiol&#8208;ene (TE) click reactions, respectively. Representative toolkit polymers were used for the synthesis of gold, iron oxide and silica nanoparticles.

         <title>G4 Sensing Pyridyl&#8208;Thiazole Polyamide Represses c&#8208;KIT Expression in Leukemia Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pyridyl bis&#8208;thiazole, TPW preferentially binds to c&#8208;KIT1 G&#8208;quadruplex over other G&#8208;quadruplexes and duplex DNA and emits high fluorescence inside cell nuclei. Despite being less toxic, it represses c&#8208;KIT transcription in cancer cells. These unique properties of TPW could be useful for the detection of G&#8208;quadruplexes and nuclear labeling of cancer cells.







Abstract
Specific sensing and functional tuning of nucleic acid secondary structures remain less explored to date. Herein, we report a thiazole polyamide TPW that binds specifically to c&#8208;KIT1 G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) with sub&#8208;micromolar affinity and &#8764;1&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometry and represses c&#8208;KIT proto&#8208;oncogene expression. TPW shows up to 10&#8208;fold increase in fluorescence upon binding with c&#8208;KIT1 G4, but shows weak or no quantifiable binding to other G4s and ds26 DNA. TPW can increase the number of G4&#8208;specific antibody (BG4) foci and mark G4 structures in cancer cells. Cell&#8208;based assays reveal that TPW can efficiently repress c&#8208;KIT expression in leukemia cells via a G4&#8208;dependent process. Thus, the polyamide can serve as a promising probe for G&#8208;quadruplex recognition with the ability to specifically alter c&#8208;KIT oncogene expression.

By diiodine&#8208;promoted one&#8208;electron oxidation of 10H&#8208;phenothiazine in a variety of solvents, the 10H&#8208;phenothiazinium radical cation, along with its radical coupling product, 10&#8208;(3&#8208;phenothiazinylidene)phenothiazinium, have been characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, the latter for the first time. Several examples of each species are presented, supported by an array of chalcogen, halogen, and hydrogen bonding interactions.







Abstract
Utilizing facile one&#8208;electron oxidation of 10H&#8208;phenothiazine by molecular diiodine, the solid&#8208;state structure of the 10H&#8208;phenothiazinium radical cation was obtained in three cation:iodide ratios, as well as its THF and acetone solvates. Oxidation of 10H&#8208;phenothiazine with molecular diiodine in DMSO or DMF provided the structure of the radical coupling product 10&#8208;(3&#8208;phenothiazinyldene)phenothiazinium, which has not been crystallographically characterized to date. The radical cations were balanced by a mixture (I7)&#8722;, (I5)&#8722;, (I3)&#8722;, and I&#8722; anions, where a variety of chalcogen, halogen, and hydrogen bonding interactions stabilize the structures to reveal these interesting cationic species.

         <title>Benzenedisulfonic Acid as an ALD/MLD Building Block for Crystalline Metal&#8208;Organic Thin Films**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new organic linker for atomic/molecular layer depositions (ALD/MLD) was demonstrated with copper and lithium metal nodes. The films are crystalline with and without water of crystallization. The applicability of dilithium&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzenedisulfonate as a solid polymer ion conductor is assessed.







Abstract
Two new atomic/molecular layer deposition processes for depositing crystalline metal&#8208;organic thin films, built from 1,4&#8208;benzenedisulfonate (BDS) as the organic linker and Cu or Li as the metal node, are reported. The processes yield in&#8208;situ crystalline but hydrated Cu&#8208;BDS and Li&#8208;BDS films; in the former case, the crystal structure is of a previously known metal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;like structure, while in the latter case not known from previous studies. Both hydrated materials can be readily dried to obtain the crystalline unhydrated phases. The stability and the ionic conductivity of the unhydrated Li&#8208;BDS films were characterized to assess their applicability as a thin film solid polymer Li&#8208;ion conductor.

The stability and the ionic conductivity of the unhydrated Li&#8208;BDS films were characterized to assess their applicability as a thin film solid polymer Li&#8208;ion conductor.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Metal Cation&#8208;Driven Dynamic Covalent Formation of Imine and Hydrazone Ligands Displaying Synergistic Co&#8208;catalysis and Auxiliary Amine Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrazone formation is strongly accelerated in the presence of both zinc ions and an auxiliary amine, traced to the very fast initial formation of the reactive ZnII&#8208;imine complex presenting a C=N bond metallo&#8208;activated towards reaction with the hydrazine component. The synergistic effect combining metallo&#8208; and organo&#8208;catalysis points to a powerful co&#8208;catalysis strategy of bond formation in DCC through interconnected chemical transformations. More information can be found in the Full Paper by M. He and J.&#8208;M. Lehn. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100662).

         <title>Kinetics and Mechanism of the Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroamination of 1,1&#8208;Dimethylallene with N&#8208;Methylaniline</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mechanism of the intermolecular hydroamination of 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;butadiene (  1  ) with  N  &#8208;methylaniline (  2  ) catalyzed by (IPr)AuOTf has been studied employing a combination of kinetic analysis, deuterium labelling studies, and  in situ  spectral analysis of catalytically active mixtures. The results of these and additional experiments are consistent with a mechanism for hydroamination involving reversible, endergonic displacement of  N  &#8208;methylaniline from [(IPr)Au(NHMePh)]  +  (  4  ) by allene to form the cationic gold &#960;&#8208;  C1,C2  &#8208;allene complex [(IPr)Au(&#951;  2  &#8208;H  2  C=C=CMe  2  )]  +  (  I  ) which is in rapid, endergonic equilibrium with the regioisomeric &#960;&#8208;  C2,C3  &#8208;allene complex [(IPr)Au(&#951;  2  &#8208;Me  2  C=C=CH  2  )]  +  (  I'  ). Rapid and reversible outer&#8208;sphere addition of  2  to the terminal allene carbon atom of  I'  to form gold vinyl complex (IPr)Au[C(=CH  2  )CMe  2  NMePh] (  II  ) is superimposed on slower addition of  2  to terminal allene carbon atom of  I  to form gold vinyl complex (IPr)Au[C(=CMe  2  )CH  2  NMePh] (  III  ). Selective protodeauration of  III  releases  N  &#8208;methyl&#8208;  N  &#8208;(3&#8208;methylbut&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;yl)aniline (  3a  ) with regeneration of  4  . At high conversion, gold vinyl complex  II  is competitively trapped by an (IPr)Au  +  fragment to form the cationic bis(gold) vinyl complex {[(IPr)Au]  2  [C(=CH  2  )CMe  2  NMePh]}  +  (  6  ).</dc:description>

         <title>Artificial supramolecular pumps powered by light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of artificial nanoscale motors that can use energy from a source to perform tasks requires systems capable of performing directionally controlled molecular movements and operating away from chemical equilibrium. Here we describe the design, synthesis and properties of pseudorotaxanes in which a photon input triggers the unidirectional motion of a macrocyclic ring with respect to a non&#8208;symmetric molecular axle. The photoinduced energy ratcheting at the basis of the pumping mechanism is validated by measuring the relevant thermodynamic and kinetic parameters. Owing to the photochemical behaviour of the azobenzene moiety embedded in the axle, the pump can repeat its operation cycle autonomously under continuous illumination. We use NMR spectroscopy to observe the dissipative non&#8208;equilibrium state generated  in situ  by light irradiation. We also show that fine changes in the axle structure lead to an improvement in the performance of the motor. Such results highlight the modularity and versatility of this minimalist pump design, which provides facile access to dynamic systems that operate under photoinduced non&#8208;equilibrium regimes.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Bond Acceptor Propensity of different Fluorine Atom Types: An Analysis of Experimentally&#8208; and Computationally&#8208;derived Parameters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The propensity of organic fluorine acting as a weak hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) in intermolecular and intramolecular interactions has been the subject of many experimental and theoretical studies often reaching different conclusions. Over the last few years new and stronger evidences have emerged for the direct involvement of fluorine in weak hydrogen bond (HB) formation. However, not all the fluorine atom types can act as weak HBA. In this work we have analyzed the differential HBA propensity of various types of fluorine atoms with a particular emphasis for the different types of alkyl fluorides. This is carried out by evaluating  ab initio  computed parameters, experimental  19  F NMR chemical shifts and small molecule crystallographic structures (extracted from the CSD database). According to this analysis, shielded (with reference to the  19  F NMR chemical shift) mono&#8208;fluorinated alkyl motifs display the highest HBA propensity in agreement with solution studies. Although much weaker than other well characterized HB complexes, the fragile HBs formed by these fluorinated motifs have important implications for the chemical&#8208;physical and structural properties of the molecules, chemical reactions and protein/ligand recognition.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The propensity of organic fluorine acting as a weak hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) in intermolecular and intramolecular interactions has been the subject of many experimental and theoretical studies often reaching different conclusions.

         <title>Exploring the Potential of Metallodrugs as Chemotherapeutics for Triple Negative Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) has one of the poorest prognoses and worst survival rates for patients, with chemotherapy still the gold standard for treatment. This review collects information on all metallodrugs studied in TNBC cells and tumors, focusing on mechanistic and in vivo studies. An outlook towards TNBC metallodrugs with translational potential is provided.







Abstract
This review focuses on studies of coordination and organometallic compounds as potential chemotherapeutics against triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) which has one of the poorest prognoses and worst survival rates from all breast cancer types. At present, chemotherapy is still the standard of care for TNBC since only one type of targeted therapy has been recently developed. References for metal&#8208;based compounds studied in TNBC cell lines will be listed, and those of metal&#8208;specific reviews, but a detailed overview will also be provided on compounds studied in&#8197;vivo (mostly in mice models) and those compounds for which some preliminary mechanistic data was obtained (in TNBC cell lines and tumors) and/or for which bioactive ligands have been used. The main goal of this review is to highlight the most promising metal&#8208;based compounds with potential as chemotherapeutic agents in TNBC.

         <title>Carbazole&#8208; and Fluorene&#8208;fused Aza&#8208;BODIPYs: NIR Fluorophores with High Brightness and Photostability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three new aza&#8208;BODIPY dyes incorporating fused fluorene or carbazole moieties were prepared. The dyes show significant enhancement of photophysical properties compared to the parent 1,3,5,7&#8208;tetraphenyl aza&#8208;BODIPY (  TPAB  ): a bathochromic shift of the absorption maximum (up to 2700 cm  &#8208;1  ) and emission maximum (up to 2270 cm  &#8208;1  ); almost 3&#8208;fold increase of molar absorption coefficients (to around 230,000 M  &#8208;1  cm  &#8208;1  ) and significant increase of the fluorescence quantum yield to 49&#8208;66%. Owing to the combination of these properties the new aza&#8208;BODIPY dyes belong to the brightest NIR dyes reported. The dyes also show excellent photostability. Due to their outstanding properties, the new dyes represent a promising platform for further exploration in biomedical research. A pH indicator containing only one fused carbazole unit is also prepared and shows absorption and emission spectra that are bathochromically shifted by about 110 and 100 nm, respectively, compared to the indicator dye based on  TPAB  chromophore.</dc:description>

         <title>Scaling Up DNA Origami Lattice Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface&#8208;assisted assembly of DNA origami lattices is a promising technique for fabricating functional surfaces. Here, the formation of a homogeneous DNA origami lattice on mica over a total surface area of 18.75 cm2 is demonstrated. Atomic force and fluorescence microscopy mapping reveal the high uniformity and homogeneity of the lattice over almost the entire surface area. The total DNA costs amount to &#8364;0.12 per cm2.







Abstract
The surface&#8208;assisted hierarchical assembly of DNA origami nanostructures is a promising route to fabricate regular nanoscale lattices. In this work, the scalability of this approach is explored and the formation of a homogeneous polycrystalline DNA origami lattice at the mica&#8208;electrolyte interface over a total surface area of 18.75&#8197;cm2 is demonstrated. The topological analysis of more than 50 individual AFM images recorded at random locations over the sample surface showed only minuscule and random variations in the quality and order of the assembled lattice. The analysis of more than 450 fluorescence microscopy images of a quantum dot&#8208;decorated DNA origami lattice further revealed a very homogeneous surface coverage over cm2 areas with only minor boundary effects at the substrate edges. At total DNA costs of &#8364;&#8197;0.12 per cm2, this large&#8208;scale nanopatterning technique holds great promise for the fabrication of functional surfaces.

         <title>Steric Effects on the Thermal Processes of Hemithioindigo Based Molecular Motor Rotation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tuning the thermal behavior of light driven molecular motors is fundamentally important for their future rational design. In many molecular motors thermal ratcheting steps are comprised of helicity inversions, energetically stabilizing the initial photoproducts. In this work we investigated a series of five hemithioindigo (HTI) based molecular motors to reveal the influence of steric hindrance in close proximity to the rotation axle on this process. Applying a high yielding synthetic procedure, we synthesized constitutional isomeric derivatives to distinguish between substitution effects at the aromatic and aliphatic position on the rotor fragment. The kinetics of thermal helix inversions were elucidated using low temperature&#160;1H NMR spectroscopy and an&#160;in situ&#160;irradiation technique. In combination with a detailed theoretical description, a comparative analysis of substituent effects on the thermal helix inversions of the rotation cycle is now possible. Such deeper understanding of the rotational cycle of HTI molecular motors is essential for speed regulation and future applications of visible light triggered nanomachines.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Mechanism of Au&#8208;catalyzed Enynamide&#8208;Yne Dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions: An Experimental and Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold&#8208;catalyzed dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reactions of ynamide derivatives allows for an efficient access to a variety of  N  &#8208;containing aromatic heterocycles. A dual gold catalysis mechanism was postulated for transformations involving the formation of C&#8208;C bonds by reaction between a terminal alkyne and an enynamide fragment. In the present article, we report our complete experimental and computational investigations on the mechanism of such a transformation. Support for a dual gold catalysis has been found and it was shown that the concerted or stepwise nature of the cyclization event depends on the substitution of the ynamide moiety. The reaction was found to proceed in 3 stages: 1) formation of a &#963;,&#960;&#8208;digold complex from the terminal alkyne, 2) cyclization to produce a  gem  &#8208;diaurated aryl complex, and 3) catalyst transfer to free the product and regenerate the &#963;,&#960;&#8208;digold complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Hydroboration of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we reported the electrochemical hydroboration of alkynes using B  2  Pin  2  &#160;as the boron source.&#160; This unprecedented reaction manifold was applied to a broad range of alkynes, giving the hydroboration products in good to excellent yields without the need of a metal catalyst or a hydride source.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of New Withaferin A Inspired Hedgehog Pathway Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural and functional properties of withaferin A suggested the design of a new candidate for Hedgehog pathway inhibitions. The enantioselective synthesis permitted the identification of two promising hits.







Abstract
Withanolides constitute a well&#8208;known family of plant&#8208;based alkaloids characterised by widespread biological properties, including the ability of interfering with Hedgehog (Hh) signalling pathway. Following our interest in natural products and in anticancer compounds, we report here the synthesis of a new class of Hh signalling pathway inhibitors, inspired by withaferin A, the first isolated member of withanolides. The decoration of our scaffolds was rationally supported by in silico studies, while functional evaluation revealed promising candidates, confirming once again the importance of natural products as inspiration source for the discovery of novel bioactive compounds. A stereoselective approach, based on Brown chemistry, allowed the obtainment and the functional evaluation of the enantiopure hit compounds.

         <title>Molecular Recognition of Disaccharides in Water: Preorganized Macrocyclic or Adaptive Acyclic?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>When facing the dilemma of following a preorganized or adaptive design approach in conceiving the architecture of new biomimetic receptors for carbohydrates, shape&#8208;persistent macrocyclic structures were most often chosen to achieve effective recognition of neutral saccharides in water. In contrast, acyclic architectures have been seldom explored, even though potentially simpler and more easily accessible. In this work, comparison of the binding properties of two structurally related diaminocarbazolic receptors, featuring a macrocyclic and an acyclic tweezers&#8208;shaped architecture, highlighted the advantages provided by the acyclic receptor in terms of selectivity in the recognition of 1,4&#8208;disaccharides of biological interest. Selective recognition of GlcNAc  2  , the core fragment of N&#8208;glycans exposed on the surface of enveloped viruses, stands as an emblematic example. NMR spectroscopic data and molecular modeling calculations were used to ascertain the differences in binding mode and to shed light on the origin of recognition efficacy and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Structure of an o&#8208;Carboranyl&#8208;Substituted Three&#8208;Coordinate Borane Radical Anion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stabilization via three&#8208;coordinate boron allows the isolation of a paramagnetic radical anion of ortho&#8208;carborane. A photophysical, electrochemical and crystallographic study backed by DFT calculations shines light on closo&#8208;nido intermediate structures, charge transfer processes and electron accepting ability.







Abstract
Bis(1&#8208;(4&#8208;tolyl)&#8208;carboran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;(4&#8208;tolyl)&#8208;borane [(1&#8208;(4&#8208;MeC6H4)&#8208;closo&#8208;1,2&#8208;C2B10H10&#8208;2&#8208;)2(4&#8208;MeC6H4)B] (1), a new bis(o&#8208;carboranyl)&#8208;(R)&#8208;borane was synthesised by lithiation of the o&#8208;carboranyl precursor and subsequent salt metathesis reaction with (4&#8208;tolyl)BBr2. Cyclic voltammetry experiments on 1 show multiple distinct reduction events with a one&#8208;electron first reduction. In a selective reduction experiment the corresponding paramagnetic radical anion 1.&#8722; was isolated and characterized. Single&#8208;crystal structure analyses allow an in&#8208;depth comparison of 1, 1.&#8722;, their calculated geometries, and the S1 excited state of 1. Photophysical studies of 1 show a charge transfer (CT) emission with low quantum yield in solution but a strong increase in the solid state. TD&#8208;DFT calculations were used to identify transition&#8208;relevant orbitals.

         <title>d/f&#8208;Polypnictides Derived by Non&#8208;Classical Ln2+ Compounds: Synthesis, Small Molecule Activation and Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Six new d/f&#8208;polyphosphides or d/f&#8208;polyarsenides, [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)] [Cp&#8242;&#8242;2Ln(E5)FeCp*] (Ln=La, Ce, Nd; E=P, As), were obtained by usage of non&#8208;classical divalent lanthanide compounds as reducing agents. While their optical properties were investigated by fs&#8208;spectroscopy, their reactivity was studied by P4 activation. The latter resulted in a selective expansion of the P5 rings ([K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)] [Cp&#8242;&#8242;2Ln(P7)FeCp*] (Ln=La, Nd)).







Abstract
Reduction chemistry induced by divalent lanthanides has been primarily focused on samarium so far. In light of the rich physical properties of the lanthanides, this limitation to one element is a drawback. Since molecular divalent compounds of almost all lanthanides have been available for some time, we used one known and two new non&#8208;classical reducing agents of the early lanthanides to establish a sophisticated reduction chemistry. As a result, six new d/f&#8208;polyphosphides or d/f&#8208;polyarsenides, [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)] [Cp&#8242;&#8242;2Ln(E5)FeCp*] (Ln=La, Ce, Nd; E=P, As) were obtained. Their reactivity was studied by activation of P4, resulting in a selective expansion of the P5 rings. The obtained compounds [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)] [Cp&#8242;&#8242;2Ln(P7)FeCp*] (Ln=La, Nd) are the first examples of an activation of P4 by a f&#8208;element&#8208;polypnictide complex. Additionally, the first systematic femtosecond (fs)&#8208;spectroscopy investigations of d/f&#8208;polypnictides are presented to showcase the advantages of having access to a broader series of lanthanide compounds.

         <title>A Novel M8L6 Cubic Cage That Binds Tetrapyridyl Porphyrins: Cage and Solvent Effects in Cobalt&#8208;Porphyrin&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclopropanation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design, synthesis, and application of a novel caged cobalt porphyrin catalyst is reported. The effects of the solvent and/or the cage on the catalytic performance in cobalt&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation reactions were investigated for the free and confined catalyst. Encapsulation of the catalyst led to a three times more active catalyst compared to the well&#8208;established cobalt&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin and leads to a substantially increased TON.







Abstract
Confinement of a catalyst can have a significant impact on catalytic performance and can lead to otherwise difficult to achieve catalyst properties. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a novel caged catalyst system Co&#8722;G@Fe8(Zn&#8722;L&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;1)6, which is soluble in both polar and apolar solvents without the necessity of any post&#8208;functionalization.

     alt="A Novel M8L6 Cubic Cage That Binds Tetrapyridyl Porphyrins: Cage and Solvent Effects in Cobalt&#8208;Porphyrin&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclopropanation Reactions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The design, synthesis, and application&lt;/b&gt; of a novel caged cobalt porphyrin catalyst is reported. The effects of the solvent and/or the cage on the catalytic performance in cobalt&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation reactions were investigated for the free and confined catalyst. Encapsulation of the catalyst led to a three times more active catalyst compared to the well&#8208;established cobalt&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin and leads to a substantially increased TON.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confinement of a catalyst can have a significant impact on catalytic performance and can lead to otherwise difficult to achieve catalyst properties. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a novel caged catalyst system &lt;b&gt;Co&#8722;G@Fe&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;(Zn&#8722;L&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&lt;b&gt;1)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, which is soluble in both polar and apolar solvents without the necessity of any post&#8208;functionalization. This is a rare example of a metal&#8208;coordination cage able to bind catalytically active porphyrins that is soluble in solvents spanning a wide variety of polarity. This system was used to investigate the combined effects of the solvent and the cage on the catalytic performance in the cobalt catalyzed cyclopropanation of styrene, which involves radical intermediates. Kinetic studies show that DMF has a protective influence on the catalyst, slowing down deactivation of both &lt;b&gt;[Co(TPP)]&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Co&#8722;G@Fe&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;(Zn&#8722;L&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&lt;b&gt;1)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, leading to higher TONs in this solvent. Moreover, DFT studies on the &lt;b&gt;[Co(TPP)]&lt;/b&gt; catalyst show that the rate determining energy barrier of this radical&#8208;type transformation is not influenced by the coordination of DMF. As such, the increased TONs obtained experimentally stem from the stabilizing effect of DMF and are not due to an intrinsic higher activity caused by axial ligand binding to the cobalt center &lt;b&gt;([Co(TPP)(L)])&lt;/b&gt;. Remarkably, encapsulation of &lt;b&gt;Co&#8722;G&lt;/b&gt; led to a three times more active catalyst than &lt;b&gt;[Co(TPP)]&lt;/b&gt; (TOF&lt;sub&gt;ini&lt;/sub&gt;) and a substantially increased TON compared to both &lt;b&gt;[Co(TPP)]&lt;/b&gt; and free &lt;b&gt;Co&#8722;G&lt;/b&gt;. The increased local concentration of the substrates in the hydrophobic cage compared to the bulk explains the observed higher catalytic activities.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Reductive Rearrangement of a 1&#8208;Phospha&#8208;2&#8208;azanorbornene</title>

1&#8208;Phospha&#8208;2&#8208;azanorbornenes (PAN) are shown to be suitable starting materials for novel bridged 7&#8208;membered phosphorus heterocycles (using lithium aluminium hydride as reducing agent) or lithium phospholide (with elemental lithium as reducing agent). Artwork by Dr. Christoph Selg.







Abstract
The reduction of the 1&#8208;phospha&#8208;2&#8208;azanorbornene derivate endo&#8208;1 with lithium aluminium hydride leads to an unprecedented 1&#8208;phosphabicyclo[3.2.1]octa&#8208;2,5&#8208;diene, while a phospholide anion is formed with lithium. The latter can be protonated resulting in formation of an unusual 2H&#8208;phosphole dimer. Furthermore, 3H&#8208;phospholes, previously assumed to have no synthetic relevance as intermediates, were proposed to act as dienophile in the dimerisation of 3,4&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1&#8208;phenylphosphole at elevated temperatures based on theoretical calculations.

         <title>Influence of Fine Ligand Substitution Modification of the Isocyanidometal Bridge on Metal to Metal Charge Transfer Properties in Class II&#8208;III Mixed Valence Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and characterization of Class II&#8208;III mixed valence complexes have been an interesting topic due to their special intermediate behavior between localized and delocalized mixed valence complexes. To investigate the influence of the isocyanidometal bridge on metal to metal charge transfer (MMCT) properties, a family of new isocyanidometal&#8208;bridged complexes and their one&#8208;electron oxidation products cis&#8208;[Cp(dppe)Fe&#8208;CN&#8208;Ru(L)2&#8208;NC&#8208;Fe(dppe)Cp][PF6]n  (n = 2, 3) (Cp = 1,3&#8208;cyclopentadiene, dppe = 1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane, L = 2,2'&#8208;bipyridine (bpy,  1[PF6]n), 5,5'&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2'&#8208;bipyridyl (5,5'&#8208;dmbpy,  2[PF6]n) and 4,4'&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2'&#8208;bipyridyl (4,4'&#8208;dmbpy,  3[PF6]n)) have been synthesized and fully characterized.&#160;The experimental results suggest that all the one&#8208;electron oxidation products may belong to Class II&#8208;III mixed valence complexes, supported by TDDFT calculations. With the change of the substituents of the bipyridyl ligand on the Ru center from H, 5,5'&#8208;dimethyl to 4,4'&#8208;dimethyl, the energy of MMCT for the one&#8208;electron oxidation complexes changes in the order:  13+  &lt;  23+  &lt;  33+  , and that for the two&#8208;electron oxidation complexes decreases in the order  14+  &gt;  34+  &gt;  24+  . The &#160;potential splitting (&#916;E1/2(2)) between the two terminal Fe centers for  N[PF6]2  are the largest potential splitting for the cyanido&#8208;bridged complexes reported so far. This work shows that the smaller potential difference between the bridging and the terminal metal centers would result in the more delocalized mixed valence complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Cs4B4O3F10: First Fluorooxoborate with [BF4] involving Heteroanionic Units and Extremely Low Melting Point</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, a new congruently melting mixed&#8208;anion compound Cs  4  B  4  O  3  F  10  has been characterized as the first fluorooxoborate with [BF  4  ] involving heteroanionic units. Cs  4  B  4  O  3  F  10  possesses two highly fluorinated anionic clusters and therefore its formula can be expressed as Cs  3  (B  3  O  3  F  6  )&#183;Cs(BF  4  ). The influence of [BF  4  ] units on micro&#8208;symmetry and structural evolution was discussed based on the parent compound. More importantly, Cs  4  B  4  O  3  F  10  shows the lowest melting point among all the available borates and thus sets a new record for such system. This work is of great significance to enrich and tailor the structure of borates using perfluorinated [BF  4  ] units.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Spirobiacridine&#8208;based Delayed Fluorescence Emitters for High&#8208;performance Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, researchers have focused on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) for efficient future lighting and displays. Among TADF emitters, a combination of triazine and acridine is a promising candidate for realizing high&#8208;efficiency organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs). However, simultaneous development of perfect horizontal orientation (&#920;  &#160;  = 100%) and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of over 40% is still challenging. Here, to obtain insights for further improvements of a triazine/acridine combination, we developed various asymmetric spirobiacridine (SBA)&#8208;based TADF emitters with a unity photoluminescence quantum yield and high &#920; ratio of over 80%. Furthermore, we studied the substitution effects of the triazine acceptor unit on the photophysical properties, including molecular orientations and OLED performance. The corresponding OLED exhibited sky&#8208;blue emission with a high EQE of over 30%.</dc:description>

However, simultaneous development of perfect horizontal orientation (&#920;  &#160;  = 100%) and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of over 40% is still challenging. Here, to obtain insights for further improvements of a triazine/acridine combination, we developed various asymmetric spirobiacridine (SBA)&#8208;based TADF emitters with a unity photoluminescence quantum yield and high &#920; ratio of over 80%. Furthermore, we studied the substitution effects of the triazine acceptor unit on the photophysical properties, including molecular orientations and OLED performance. The corresponding OLED exhibited sky&#8208;blue emission with a high EQE of over 30%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bio&#8208;inspired and Eco&#8208;friendly Synthesis of 3D Spongy Meso&#8208;Microporous Carbons from CO2 for Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by the spongy bone structures, three&#8208;dimensional (3D) sponge&#8208;like carbons with meso&#8208;microporous structures are synthesized through one&#8208;step electro&#8208;reduction of CO  2  in molten carbonate Li  2  CO  3  &#8208;Na  2  CO  3  &#8208;K  2  CO  3  at 580&#176;C. SPC4&#8208;0.5 (spongy porous carbon obtained by electrolysis of CO  2  at 4 A for 0.5 h) is synthesized with the current efficiency of 96.9%. SPC4&#8208;0.5 possesses large electrolyte ion accessible surface area, excellent wettability and electronical conductivity, ensuring the fast and effective mass and charge transfer, which make it an advcanced supercapacitor electrode material. SPC4&#8208;0.5 exhibits a specific capacitance as high as 373.7 F g  &#8208;1  at 0.5 A g  &#8208;1  , excellent cycling stability (retaining 95.9 % of the initial capacitance after 10000 cycles at 10 A g  &#8208;1  ), as well as high energy density. The applications of SPC4&#8208;0.5 in quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state symmetric supercapacitor and all&#8208;solid&#8208;state flexible devices for energy storage and wearable piezoelectric sensor are investigated. Both devices show considerable capacitive performances. This work not only presents a controllable and facile synthetic route for the porous carbons but also provides a promising way for effective carbon reduction and green energy production.</dc:description>

         <title>Hollow POM@MOF&#8208;derived porous NiMo6@Co3O4 for superlative biothiol colorimetric detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing highly active and sensitive peroxidase mimics for  L  &#8208;cysteine (  L  &#8208;Cys) colorimetric detection is very important for biotechnology and medical diagnosis. Herein, polyoxometalate&#8208;doped porous Co  3  O  4  composite (NiMo  6  @Co  3  O  4  ) was designed and prepared for the first time. Compared with pure and commercial Co  3  O  4  , NiMo  6  @Co  3  O  4  (n) composites exhibit the enhanced peroxidase&#8208;mimicking activities and stabilities due to the strong synergistic effect between porous Co  3  O  4  and multi&#8208;electron NiMo  6  clusters. Moreover, the peroxidase&#8208;mimicking activities of NiMo  6  @Co  3  O  4  (n) composites are heavily dependent on the doping mass of NiMo  6  , and the optimized NiMo  6  @Co  3  O  4  (2) exhibits the superlative peroxidase&#8208;mimicking activity. More importantly, a sensitive  L  &#8208;Cys colorimetric detection is developed with the sensitivity of 0.023 &#956;M  &#8208;1  and the detection limit at least 0.018 &#956;M in the linear range of 1&#8722;20 &#956;M, which is by far the best enzyme&#8208;mimetic performances, to the best our knowledge.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Nanosheets Stacked Hierarchical &#8220;Honey Stick&#8208;like&#8221; MFI Zeolite by Aromatic Heterocyclic Dual&#8208;functional Organic Structure&#8208;Directing Agent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Soft template designing is the most promised strategy for synthesis of zeolites nanosheets. So far, MFI nanosheets directed by soft templates (containing long chain alkyl groups or aromatic groups as hydrophobic component), can be found frequently. However, the MFI nanosheets synthesized by soft template with aromatic heterocycle groups (e.g. s&#8208;triazine groups) are rare. Herein, nanosheets stacked hierarchical MFI zeolite (NSHM) has been synthesized utilizing a triply branched s&#8208;triazine based surfactant as a bifunctional organic structure&#8208;directing agent. On the basis of geometrical match relationship, a formation model has been proposed. Synthesized NSHM was endowed with abundant mesopores stacked by nanosheets and exhibited a high surface area (430 m  2  &#8236;&#183;g  &#8208;1  ). The 1 wt% Pd/NSHM attained a significant increase in cyclohexanol/cyclohexanone mixture yield (from 66% to 85%) in oxidation of cyclohexane compared with Silicalite&#8208;1 and SBA&#8208;15 as supports.</dc:description>

         <title>Developing Bright GFP&#8208;Like Fluorogens for Live&#8208;Cell Imaging with Nonpolar Protein&#8208;Chromophore Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescence&#8208;activating proteins (FAPs) that bind a chromophore and activate its fluorescence have gained popularity in bioimaging. The fluorescence&#8208;activating and absorption&#8208;shifting tag (FAST) is a light&#8208;weight FAP that enables fast reversible fluorogen binding, thus advancing multiplex and super&#8208;resolution imaging. However, the rational design of FAST&#8208;specific fluorogens with large fluorescence enhancement (FE) remains challenging. Here, we report a novel fluorogen directly engineered from green fluorescent protein (GFP) chromophore by a unique double&#8208;donor&#8208;one&#8208;acceptor strategy, which exhibits an over 550&#8208;fold FE upon FAST binding and a high extinction coefficient of ~100,000 M  &#8722;1  &#183;cm  &#8722;1  . Correlation analysis of the excited state nonradiative decay rates and environmental factors reveal that the large FE is caused by nonpolar protein&#8208;fluorogen interactions. Our deep insights into structure&#8208;function relationships could guide the rational design of bright fluorogens for live&#8208;cell imaging with extended spectral properties such as redder emissions.</dc:description>

The resulting diketones are alkynylated and reduced to give the title compounds, bis(TIPS&#8208;ethynyl) substituted naphtho[1,8&#8208;  gh  :5,4&#8208;  g  '  h  ']diquinoline and naphtho[1,8&#8208;  bc  :5,4&#8208;  b  '  c  ']diacridine. Nitrogen incorporation stabilizes the bisacenes with respect to oxidation compared to their consanguine nonaza&#8208;analogs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Azide&#8208;Functionalized Derivatives of the Virulence&#8208;Associated Sugar Pseudaminic Acid: Chiral Pool Synthesis and Labeling of Bacteria</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailor&#8208;made derivatives of pseudaminic acid (Pse) allow for the detection of Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria expressing this unique virulence&#8208;associated nonulosonic acid. The synthesis of azido&#8208;labeled Pse derivatives starting from d&#8208;glucose and respective labeling studies are described.







Abstract
Pseudaminic acid (Pse) is a significant prokaryotic monosaccharide found in important Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. This unique sugar serves as a component of cell&#8208;surface&#8208;associated glycans or glycoproteins and is associated with their virulence. We report the synthesis of azidoacetamido&#8208;functionalized Pse derivatives as part of a search for Pse&#8208;derived metabolic labeling reagents. The synthesis was initiated with d&#8208;glucose (Glc), which served as a cost&#8208;effective chiral pool starting material. Key synthetic steps involve the conversion of C1 of Glc into the terminal methyl group of Pse, and inverting deoxyaminations at C3 and C5 of Glc followed by backbone elongation with a three&#8208;carbon unit using the Barbier reaction. Metabolic labeling experiments revealed that, of the four Pse derivatives, ester&#8208;protected C5 azidoacetamido&#8208;Pse successfully labeled cells of Pse&#8208;expressing Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative strains. No labeling was observed in cells of non&#8208;Pse&#8208;expressing strains. The ester&#8208;protected and C5 azidoacetamido&#8208;functionalized Pse is thus a useful reagent for the identification of bacteria expressing this unique virulence&#8208;associated nonulosonic acid.

         <title>Photoinduced Electron vs. Concerted Proton Electron Transfer Pathways in SnIV (l&#8208;Tryptophanato)2 Porphyrin Conjugates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoinduced electron transfer (ET) or concerted proton&#8208;electron transfer (CPET) occur in tin(IV) porphyrin&#8208;tryptophan conjugates in dichloromethane in the presence of an organic base depending on the chromophore identity and spin multiplicity of the excited state which point out how peculiar the l&#8208;tryptophan amino acid is with respect to charge transfer reactions.







Abstract
Aromatic amino acids such as l&#8208;tyrosine and l&#8208;tryptophan are deployed in natural systems to mediate electron transfer (ET) reactions. While tyrosine oxidation is always coupled to deprotonation (proton&#8208;coupled electron&#8208;transfer, PCET), both ET&#8208;only and PCET pathways can occur in the case of the tryptophan residue. In the present work, two novel conjugates 1 and 2, based on a SnIV tetraphenylporphyrin and SnIV octaethylporphyrin, respectively, as the chromophore/electron acceptor and l&#8208;tryptophan as electron/proton donor, have been prepared and thoroughly characterized by a combination of different techniques including single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. The photophysical investigation of 1 and 2 in CH2Cl2 in the presence of pyrrolidine as a base shows that different quenching mechanisms are operating upon visible&#8208;light excitation of the porphyrin component, namely photoinduced electron transfer and concerted proton electron transfer (CPET), depending on the chromophore identity and spin multiplicity of the excited state. The results are compared with those previously described for metal&#8208;mediated analogues featuring SnIV porphyrin chromophores and l&#8208;tyrosine as the redox active amino acid and well illustrate the peculiar role of l&#8208;tryptophan with respect to PCET.

         <title>Imide Condensation as a Strategy for the Synthesis of Core&#8208;Diversified G&#8208;Quadruplex Ligands with Anticancer and Antiparasitic Activity**

The rigid rules of G&#8208;quadruplex stabilization: A library of amphiphiles has been synthesized in one step, using a simple imide condensation reaction. The G&#8208;quadruplex stabilization, anti&#8208;cancer and anti&#8208;parasitic activity of the library has been investigated, uncovering the important factors that govern G&#8208;quadruplex binding and selectivity, yielding a promising new core&#8208;motif and a compound with potent trypanosomacidal activity.







Abstract
A facile imide coupling strategy for the one&#8208;step preparation of G&#8208;quadruplex ligands with varied core chemistries is described. The G&#8208;quadruplex stabilization of a library of nine compounds was examined using FRET melting experiments, and CD, UV&#8208;Vis, fluorescence and NMR titrations, identifying several compounds that were capable of stabilizing G&#8208;quadruplex DNA with interesting selectivity profiles. The best G4 ligand was identified as compound 3, which was based on a perylene scaffold and exhibited 40&#8208;fold selectivity for a telomeric G&#8208;quadruplex over duplex DNA. Surprisingly, a tetra&#8208;substituted flexible core, compound 11, also exhibited selective stabilization of G4 DNA over duplex DNA. The anticancer and antiparasitic activity of the library was also examined, with the lead compound 3 exhibiting nanomolar inhibition of Trypanosoma brucei with 78&#8208;fold selectivity over MRC5 cells. The cellular localization of this compound was also studied via fluorescence microscopy. We found that uptake was time dependant, with localization outside the nucleus and kinetoplast that could be due to strong fluorescence quenching in the presence of small amounts of DNA.

         <title>Mechanistic and Kinetic Factors of ortho&#8208;Benzyne Formation in Hexadehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder (HDDA) Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview highlights the mechanism of ortho&#8208;aryne formation via hexadehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reactions, based on quantum chemical calculations, as well as kinetic, preparative and ultrafast spectroscopic experiments. The influence of the steric, electronic, and radical&#8208;stabilizing effects of substituents attached to diyne/diynophile pairs and linked yne&#8208;diynes provide crucial insight into the reaction mechanism.







Abstract
With the rapid development of the hexadehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction (HDDA) from its first discovery in 1997, the question of whether a concerted or stepwise mechanism better describes the thermally activated formation of ortho&#8208;benzyne from a diyne and a diynophile has been debated. Mechanistic and kinetic investigations were able to show that this is not a black or white situation, as minor changes can tip the balance. For that reason, especially, linked yne&#8208;diynes were studied to examine steric, electronic, and radical&#8208;stabilizing effects of their terminal substituents on the reaction mechanism and kinetics. Furthermore, the influence of the nature of the linker on the HDDA reaction was explored. The more recently discovered photochemical HDDA reaction also gives ortho&#8208;arynes, which display the same reactivity as the thermally generated ones, but their formation might not proceed by the same mechanism. This minireview summarizes the current state of mechanistic understanding of the HDDA reaction.

         <title>A Protecting&#8208;Group&#8208;Free Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Salvinorin A</title>

A divine sage: The potent KOR agonist (&#8722;)&#8208;salvinorin A was synthesized in only sixteen steps by modification of our previous route to the racemic title compound. Transition to asymmetric synthesis succeeded by a highly enantioselective propargylation to install the stereogenic center at C&#8208;12. Shortening of the original reaction sequence by two steps was finally achieved using a chemoselective Mitsunobu esterification of a cyclic syn 1,2&#8208;diol. Furthermore, an alternative intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder strategy employing a 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene moiety was investigated.







Abstract
A concise enantioselective total synthesis of the neoclerodane diterpene (&#8722;)&#8208;salvinorin A is reported. The stereogenic center at C&#8208;12 was installed by catalytic asymmetric propargylation with excellent enantioselectivity, and the remaining six stereogenic centers were set up highly diastereoselectively under substrate control. As for our previous synthesis of racemic salvinorin A, two intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder reactions were applied to generate the tricyclic core. A chemoselective Mitsunobu inversion of a syn 1,2&#8208;diol allowed for further streamlining of the original reaction sequence by two steps. Overall, (&#8722;)&#8208;salvinorin A was synthesized in only 16 steps starting from 3&#8208;furaldehyde with 1.4&#8201;% total yield. Furthermore, an alternative intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder strategy employing a 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene moiety was investigated.

         <title>Paramagnetic Solid&#8208;State NMR to Localize the Metal&#8208;Ion Cofactor in an Oligomeric DnaB Helicase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Paramagnetic solid&#8208;state NMR enables the positioning of the metal&#8208;ion co&#8208;factor in the ATP&#8208;fueled bacterial helicase DnaB from Helicobacter pylori. Diamagnetic Mg2+ is exchanged by paramagnetic Mn2+ and Co2+ leading to paramagnetic relaxation enhancements and pseudo&#8208;contact shifts in the NMR spectra. The Co2+ pseudo&#8208;contact shift surface reveals insights into DNA binding.







Abstract
Paramagnetic metal ions can be inserted into ATP&#8208;fueled motor proteins by exchanging the diamagnetic Mg2+ cofactor with Mn2+ or Co2+. Then, paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) or pseudo&#8208;contact shifts (PCSs) can be measured to report on the localization of the metal ion within the protein. We determine the metal position in the oligomeric bacterial DnaB helicase from Helicobacter pylori complexed with the transition&#8208;state ATP&#8208;analogue ADP:AlF4&#8722; and single&#8208;stranded DNA using solid&#8208;state NMR and a structure&#8208;calculation protocol employing CYANA. We discuss and compare the use of Mn2+ and Co2+ in localizing the ATP cofactor in large oligomeric protein assemblies. 31P PCSs induced in the Co2+&#8208;containing sample are then used to localize the DNA phosphate groups on the Co2+ PCS tensor surface enabling structural insights into DNA binding to the DnaB helicase.

         <title>Excited State Properties of Lanthanide(III) Complexes with a Nonadentate Bispidine Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
EuIII, TbIII, GdIII and YbIII complexes of a nonadentate bispidine derivative were successfully synthesized and their emission properties studied. The X&#8208;ray crystallography reveals full encapsulation by the nonadentate ligand, and the identical emission spectra in the solid state and in solution confirm equal structures in both media. As therefore expected, this results in long&#8208;lived excited states and high emission quantum yields, making these complexes a possible basis for interesting biological probes.







Abstract
EuIII, TbIII, GdIII and YbIII complexes of the nonadentate bispidine derivative L2 (bispidine=3,7&#8208;diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane) were successfully synthesized and their emission properties studied. The X&#8208;ray crystallography reveals full encapsulation by the nonadentate ligand L2 that enforces to all LnIII cations a common highly symmetrical capped square antiprismatic (CSAPR) coordination geometry (pseudo C4v symmetry). The well&#8208;resolved identical emission spectra in solid state and in solution confirm equal structures in both media. As therefore expected, this results in long&#8208;lived excited states and high emission quantum yields ([EuIIIL2]+, H2O, 298&#8197;K, &#964;=1.51&#8197;ms, &#966;=0.35; [TbIIIL2]+, H2O, 298&#8197;K, &#964;=1.95&#8197;ms, &#966;=0.68). Together with the very high kinetic and thermodynamic stabilities, these complexes are a possible basis for interesting biological probes.

Abstract
A new concept for the regioselective synthesis of [3&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;1] hexakis&#8208;adducts of fullerene C60 was developed. Based on sequential tether&#8208;directed remote functionalizations, chiral [3&#8201;:&#8201;2] pentakis&#8208;adducts with an incomplete octahedral addition pattern were synthesized via stepwise cyclopropanation of C60 with suitable macrocyclic tri&#8208; and bifunctional cyclomalonate tethers. The four resulting stereoisomers were isolated using chiral HPLC. The corresponding pairs of enantiomers show mirror image behavior in their CD&#8208;spectra. The pentakis&#8208;adducts served as suitable building blocks for the spatially controlled synthesis of mixed hexakis&#8208;adducts. Implementation of functional group&#8208;bearing monomalonates afforded octahedral [3&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;1] hexakis&#8208;adducts suitable for the construction of larger molecular and supramolecular fullerene architectures in excellent yield.

         <title>Cationic Aluminium Complexes as Catalysts for Imine Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>

Abstract
Strongly Lewis acidic cationic aluminium complexes, stabilized by &#946;&#8211;diketiminate (BDI) ligands and free of Lewis bases, have been prepared as their B(C6F5)4&#8722; salts and were investigated for catalytic activity in imine hydrogenation. The backbone (R1) and N (R2) substituents on the R1,R2BDI ligand (R1,R2BDI=HC[C(R1)N(R2)]2) influence sterics and Lewis acidity. Ligand bulk increases along the row Me,DIPPBDI&lt;Me,DIPePBDI&#8776;tBu,DIPPBDI&lt;tBu,DIPePBDI; DIPP=2,6&#8208;C(H)Me2&#8208;phenyl, DIPeP=2,6&#8208;C(H)Et2&#8208;phenyl. The Gutmann&#8208;Beckett test showed acceptor numbers of: (tBu,DIPPBDI)AlMe+ 85.6, (tBu,DIPePBDI)AlMe+ 85.9, (Me,DIPPBDI)AlMe+ 89.7, (Me,DIPePBDI)AlMe+ 90.8, (Me,DIPPBDI)AlH+ 95.3. Steric and electronic factors need to be balanced for catalytic activity in imine hydrogenation. Open, highly Lewis acidic, cations strongly coordinate imine rendering it inactive as a Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP). The bulkiest cations do not coordinate imine but its combination is also not an active catalyst. The cation (tBu,DIPPBDI)AlMe+ shows the best catalytic activity for various imines and is also an active catalyst for the Tishchenko reaction of benzaldehyde to benzylbenzoate. DFT calculations on the mechanism of imine hydrogenation catalysed by cationic Al complexes reveal two interconnected catalytic cycles operating in concert. Hydrogen is activated either by FLP reactivity of an Al&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;imine couple or, after formation of significant quantities of amine, by reaction with an Al&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;amine couple. The latter autocatalytic Al&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;amine cycle is energetically favoured.

         <title>Polythiolactone&#8208;Decorated Silica Particles: A Versatile Approach for Surface Functionalization, Catalysis and Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer&#8208;decorated precursor particles: Silica particles functionalized with polythiolactone polymer brushes are precursor particles for molecular surface functionalization, nanoparticle assemblies for catalysis, and polymer capsules for payload delivery applications.







Abstract
The surface chemistry of colloidal silica has tremendous effects on its properties and applications. Commonly the design of silica particles is based on their de novo synthesis followed by surface functionalization leading to tailormade properties for a specific purpose. Here, the design of robust &#8220;precursor&#8221; polymer&#8208;decorated silica nano&#8208; and microparticles is demonstrated, which allows for easy post&#8208;modification by polymer embedded thiolactone chemistry. To obtain this organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid material, silica particles (SiO2P) were functionalized via surface&#8208;initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI&#8208;ATRP) with poly(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl acrylate) (PHEA)&#8208;poly(thiolactone acrylamide (PThlAm) co&#8208;polymer brushes. Exploiting the versatility of thiolactone post&#8208;modification, a system was developed that could be used in three exemplary applications: 1) the straightforward molecular post&#8208;functionalization to tune the surface polarity, and therefore the dispersibility in various solvents; 2) the immobilization of metal nanoparticles into the polymer brushes via the in&#8197;situ formation of free thiols that preserved catalytic activity in a model reaction; 3) the formation of redox&#8208;responsive, permeable polymer capsules by crosslinking the thiolactone moieties with cystamine dihydrochloride (CDH) followed by dissolution of the silica core.

         <title>Towards Heteroleptic Dicoordinate CuII Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing a bulky carbazolyl substituent, heteroleptic dicoordinate copper complexes with CuII character were synthesised. Delocalisation of the spin density in the ligand scaffold as well as dispersion forces apparently play a role in the stabilisation of these compounds.







Abstract
In this work we detail our efforts to systematically generate stable dicoordinate CuII complexes. Initial experiments via metathesis reactions of a bulky potassium carbazolide (RK) with copper(II) salts indeed yielded a stable product, RCuOTf (1). However, subsequent attempts to grasp systematic synthetic access to complexes of the type RCuX (X=monoanionic ligand) proved difficult as many of the complexes rapidly decomposed in solution. By using triflate&#8208;related ligands such as ethyl sulfate and bistriflimide, the additional dicoordinate copper complexes RCuOSO3Et (2), [RCu(THF)][Cu(NTf2)2] (3) and RCuNTf2 (4) could be isolated. Spectroscopic indications corroborate more CuI than CuII character in all RCuX derivatives.

         <title>Consequences of amide connectivity in the supramolecular polymerization of porphyrins: spectroscopic observations rationalized by theoretical modelling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The correlation between molecular structure and mechanism of supramolecular polymerizations is a topic of great interest, with a special focus on the pathway complexity of porphyrin assemblies. Their cooperative polymerization typically yields highly ordered, long 1D polymers and is driven by a combination of &#960;&#8208;stacking due to solvophobic effects and hydrogen bonding interactions. Subtle changes in molecular structure, however, have significant influence on the cooperativity factor and yield different aggregate types (J&#8208; versus H&#8208;aggregates) of different lengths. In this study we investigate the influence of amide connectivity on the self&#8208;assembly behavior of porphyrin based supramolecular monomers. While in apolar solvents C=O centered monomers readily assemble into helical supramolecular polymers via a cooperative mechanism, their NH centered counterparts form short, non&#8208;helical J&#8208;type aggregates via an isodesmic pathway. With a combination of spectroscopy and density functional theory modelling, we shed light on the molecular origins causing this stunning difference in assembly properties and demonstrate the importance of molecular connectivity in the design of supramolecular systems. Finally, we present their mutual interference in copolymerization experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Endohedral Mixed Aggregates: Sodium Alkoxide Cages with Organic or Inorganic Central Anions and Variable Hull</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkali metal alkoxides are widely used in chemistry due to their Br&#248;nsted basic and nucleophilic properties. Potassium alkoxides assist alkyllithium in the metalation of hydrocarbons in Lochmann&#8208;Schlosser&#8208;bases. Both compounds form mixed aggregates, which enhance the thermal stability, solubility, and the basic reactivity of these mixtures. A very unusual spherical mixed alkoxy aggregate was discovered by Gr&#252;tzmacher et al., where a central dihydrogen phosphide anion is surrounded by a highly dynamic shell of thirteen sodium atoms and a hull of twelve tert &#8208;butoxide groups. This structural motif can be reproduced by a reaction of trimethylsilyl compounds of methane, halogens, or pseudo&#8208;halogens with excess sodium tert &#8208;butoxide. A nucleophilic substitution releases the corresponding anion, which is then encapsulated by the sodium alkoxide units. The compounds are soluble in hydrocarbon solvents, enabling studies of solutions by high resolution NMR spectroscopy and IR/Raman studies of the crystalline materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Organic Polysulfides from Disulfides via Sulfur Insertion from S8 and an Unexpected Solvent Effect on the Product Distribution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An electrochemical synthesis of organic polysulfides via sulfur insertion from elemental sulfur to disulfides or thiols was introduced. The highly economic, insensitive and low&#8208;priced reaction gives a mixture of polysulfides, whose distribution can be influenced by the addition of different amounts of carbon disulfide as co&#8208;solvent. To describe the variable distribution function of the polysulfides, a novel parameter, the &#8220;  absorbance average  s  ulfur  a  mount in  p  olysulfides&#8221; (SAP) was introduced and defined on the basis of the &#8220;number average molar mass&#8221; used in polymer chemistry. Various organic polysulfides were synthesized with variable volume fractions of carbon disulfide and the yield of each polysulfide was determined by quantitative  13  C NMR. Also, by using two symmetrical disulfides or a disulfide and a thiol as starting materials, a mixture of symmetrical and unsymmetrical polysulfides was obtained.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent 2D Patterning, Local Electronic Structure and Polarization Switching of Graphene at the Nanometer Level</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoscale patterning and tailoring of graphene was realized by a very facile and highly efficient approach, which includes a first&#8208;step patterned fluorination with a very high degree of functionalization, realized by laser writing, and a subsequent nucleophilic substitution of the attached fluorine atoms with thiophene groups.







Abstract
A very facile and efficient protocol for the covalent patterning and properties tuning of graphene is reported. Highly reactive fluorine radicals were added to confined regions of graphene directed by laser writing on graphene coated with 1&#8208;fluoro&#8208;3,3&#8208;dimethylbenziodoxole. This process allows for the realization of exquisite patterns on graphene with resolutions down to 200&#8197;nm. The degree of functionalization, ranging from the unfunctionalized graphene to extremely high functionalized graphene, can be precisely tuned by controlling the laser irradiation time. Subsequent substitution of the initially patterned fluorine atoms afforded an unprecedented graphene nanostructure bearing thiophene groups. This substitution led to a complete switch of both the electronic structure and the polarization within the patterned graphene regions. This approach paves the way towards the precise modulation of the structure and properties of nanostructured graphene.

         <title>5&#8208;Hydroxymethyl&#8208;, 5&#8208;Formyl&#8208; and 5&#8208;Carboxydeoxycytidines as Oxidative Lesions and Epigenetic Marks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exact UHPLC&#8208;MS2 quantifications were used to determine the oxidative lesion and epigenetically induced levels of the non&#8208;canonical bases hmdC, fdC and cadC and of the levels of base excision repair intermediates.







Abstract
The four non&#8208;canonical nucleotides in the human genome 5&#8208;methyl&#8208;, 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;, 5&#8208;formyl&#8208; and 5&#8208;carboxydeoxycytidine (mdC, hmdC, fdC and cadC) form a second layer of epigenetic information that contributes to the regulation of gene expression. Formation of the oxidized nucleotides hmdC, fdC and cadC requires oxidation of mdC by ten&#8208;eleven translocation (Tet) enzymes that require oxygen, Fe(II) and &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate as cosubstrates. Although these oxidized forms of mdC are widespread in mammalian genomes, experimental evidence for their presence in fungi and plants is ambiguous. This vagueness is caused by the fact that these oxidized mdC derivatives are also formed as oxidative lesions, resulting in unclear basal levels that are likely to have no epigenetic function. Here, we report the xdC levels in the fungus Amanita muscaria in comparison to murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs), HEK cells and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), to obtain information about the basal levels of hmdC, fdC and cadC as DNA lesions in the genome.

         <title>Tuning J&#8208;aggregate Formation and Emission Efficiency in Cationic Diazapentacenium Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new diazapentacenium salts have been obtained from a new synthetic methodology and shown to display a drastic increase of fluorescence quantum yields induced by aggregation (AIE phenomena) in poor solvents and associated to a particular type of aggregates organization: J&#8208;aggregates. A simple structural modification (4 H in D1 vs 4 F in D2) changes the contribution of J&#8208;aggregates which is quantitatively followed by time resolved fluorescence.







Abstract
Enhancement of the luminescence efficiency of two new diazapentacenium salts (D1 and D2) of more than 55 for D1 and 22 times for D2) in poor solvents, acetonitrile and/or dichloromethane, was observed and rationalized as formation of emissive J&#8208;aggregates. Both compounds displaying 4&#8208;n&#8208;decylphenyl substituents at the 7,14&#8208;carbons and phenyl (D1) or 2,6&#8208;difluorophenyl (D2) substituents at the quaternary nitrogen atoms in 5,12&#8208;positions have been synthetized in a two&#8208;step procedure involving a two&#8208;fold Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig&#8208;type CN cross&#8208;coupling and an electrophilic Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;type cyclization. The optical properties of the dicationic diazapentacenium salts in various solvents and in thin films have been investigated by steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopies. In thin films and in good solvents, isolated molecules coexist with aggregates. Nonetheless, D1 is seven times more emissive than D2, reflecting a higher J&#8208;aggregate contribution in the former.

         <title>The Mechanism of Cleavage of RNA Phosphodiesters by a Gold Nanoparticle Nanozyme</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uridine 3&#8217;&#8208;alkyl&#8208; and aryl&#8208;phosphodiesters are easily cleaved by gold nanozymes functionalized with Zn(II) ligands with a nucleophilic mechanism. The catalytic site requires two metal ions for catalysis and at least a third one for binding of the uridine nucleobase.







Abstract
The cleavage of uridine 3&#8217;&#8208;phosphodiesters bearing alcohols with pKa ranging from 7.14 to 14.5 catalyzed by AuNPs functionalized with 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane&#8208;Zn(II) complexes has been studied to unravel the source of catalysis by these nanosystems (nanozymes). The results have been compared with those obtained with two Zn(II) dinuclear catalysts for which the mechanism is fairly understood. Binding to the Zn(II) ions by the substrate and the uracil of uridine was observed. The latter leads to inhibition of the process and formation of less productive binding complexes than in the absence of the nucleobase. The nanozyme operates with these substrates mostly via a nucleophilic mechanism with little stabilization of the pentacoordinated phosphorane and moderate assistance in leaving group departure. This is attributed to a decrease of binding strength of the substrate to the catalytic site in reaching the transition state due to an unfavorable binding mode with the uracil. The nanozyme favors substrates with better leaving groups than the less acidic ones.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven gem Hydrogenation: An Orthogonal Entry into &#8220;Second&#8208;Generation&#8221; Ruthenium Carbene Catalysts for Olefin Metathesis</title>

         <dc:description>
On the spot: Light&#8208;driven gem hydrogenation elicits the inherent vic&#8208;dicarbene character of a triple bond. This unusual reactivity mode can be harnessed in the form of a novel, safe, convenient and efficient approach to second&#8208;generation &#8220;Grubbs&#8208;Hoveyda&#8221;&#8208;type ruthenium carbene complexes for olefin metathesis that relies on the use of alkynes rather than diazoalkanes as the ultimate carbene sources.







Abstract
The newly discovered light&#8208;driven gem hydrogenation of alkynes opens an unconventional yet efficient entry into five&#8208;coordinate Grubbs&#8208;type ruthenium carbene complexes with cis&#8208;disposed chloride ligands. Representatives of this class featuring a chelate substructure formed by an iodo&#8208;substituted benzylidene unit react with (substituted) 2&#8208;isopropoxystyrene to give prototypical &#8220;second&#8208;generation&#8221; Grubbs&#8208;Hoveyda complexes for olefin metathesis. The new approach to this venerable catalyst family is safe and versatile as it uses a triple bond rather than phenyldiazomethane as the ultimate carbene source and does not require any sacrificial phosphines.

         <title>Rerouting and Improving Dauc&#8208;8&#8208;en&#8208;11&#8208;ol Synthase from Streptomyces venezuelae to a High Yielding Biocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Daucenol Synthase (DcS) from Streptomyces venezuelae was redirected using substrate analogues with additional, shifted, or lacking methyl groups to yield molecules from a naturally difficult to access chemical space, and improved in its catalytic efficiency through site&#8208;directed mutagenesis of surface residues, turning DcS into a high yielding biocatalyst.







Abstract
The dauc&#8208;8&#8208;en&#8208;11&#8208;ol synthase from Streptomyces venezuelae was investigated for its catalytic activity towards alternative terpene precursors, specifically designed to enable new cyclisation pathways. Exchange of aromatic amino acid residues at the enzyme surface by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis led to a 4&#8208;fold increase of the yield in preparative scale incubations, which likely results from an increased enzyme stability instead of improved enzyme kinetics.

         <title>Prediction and Validation of a Druggable Site on Virulence Factor of Drug Resistant Burkholderia cenocepacia**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new druggable site for anti&#8208;adhesive therapy. We used fragment&#8208;based virtual screening to explore the druggability of a region in the vicinity of the fucose binding site in a lectin from an opportunistic and highly drug&#8208;resistant pathogen. The crystal structure of the target protein complexed with the lead fragment validated the existence of a secondary binding site, paving the way for the design of potent ligands to be employed in anti&#8208;adhesive therapy.







Abstract
Burkholderia cenocepacia is an opportunistic Gram&#8208;negative bacterium that causes infections in patients suffering from chronic granulomatous diseases and cystic fibrosis. It displays significant morbidity and mortality due to extreme resistance to almost all clinically useful antibiotics. The bacterial lectin BC2L&#8208;C expressed in B. cenocepacia is an interesting drug target involved in bacterial adhesion and subsequent deadly infection to the host. We solved the first high resolution crystal structure of the apo form of the lectin N&#8208;terminal domain (BC2L&#8208;C&#8208;nt) and compared it with the ones complexed with carbohydrate ligands. Virtual screening of a small fragment library identified potential hits predicted to bind in the vicinity of the fucose binding site. A series of biophysical techniques and X&#8208;ray crystallographic screening were employed to validate the interaction of the hits with the protein domain. The X&#8208;ray structure of BC2L&#8208;C&#8208;nt complexed with one of the identified active fragments confirmed the ability of the site computationally identified to host drug&#8208;like fragments. The fragment affinity could be determined by titration microcalorimetry. These structure&#8208;based strategies further provide an opportunity to elaborate the fragments into high affinity anti&#8208;adhesive glycomimetics, as therapeutic agents against B. cenocepacia.

         <title>Fluorinated Azobenzenes Switchable with Red Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular photoswitches find rapidly growing applications in biocompatible materials and photopharmacology. ortho&#8208;Fluorinated azobenzenes bearing conjugated sp2 substituents can be effectively photoisomerized with light wavelengths above 630&#8197;nm, within the &#8220;therapeutic window&#8221;, which enables deep penetration of soft human tissues. This observation may therefore facilitate the design of new&#8208;generation stimuli&#8208;responsive therapeutics.







Abstract
Molecular photoswitches triggered with red or NIR light are optimal for photomodulation of complex biological systems, including efficient penetration of the human body for therapeutic purposes (&#8220;therapeutic window&#8221;). Yet, they are rarely reported, and even more rarely functional under aqueous conditions. In this work, fluorinated azobenzenes are shown to exhibit efficient E&#8594;Z photoisomerization with red light (PSS660nm &gt;75&#8201;% Z) upon conjugation with unsaturated substituents. Initially demonstrated for aldehyde groups, this effect was also observed in a more complex structure by incorporating the chromophore into a cyclic dipeptide with propensity for self&#8208;assembly. Under physiological conditions, the latter molecule formed a supramolecular material that reversibly changed its viscosity upon irradiation with red light. Our observation can lead to design of new photopharmacology agents or phototriggered materials for in&#8197;vivo use.

         <title>Chemical Bonding in Silicon Carbonyl Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Revisiting the chemical bond on silylene&#8208;carbonyl species reveals a donor&#8208;acceptor interaction between the CO and the silylene. The bonding can be conventionally understood as a &#963;&#8208;donation from the &#963;CO into the empty p&#8208;orbital of silicon, and a &#960;&#8208;back donation from the sp2 lone pair of silicon into the &#960;*CO antibonding orbitals. Nonetheless, an unrecognized &#960;&#8208;back&#8208;donation from the R&#8722;Si &#963;&#8208;orbital into the &#960;*CO antibonding orbital faithfully explains the relationship between structure and stability.







Abstract
Although silylene&#8208;carbonyl complexes are known for decades, only recently isolable examples have been accomplished. In this work, the bonding situation is re&#8208;evaluated to explain the origins of their remarkable stability within the Kohn&#8208;Sham molecular orbital theory framework. It is shown that the chemical bond can be understood as CO interaction with the silylene via a donor&#8208;acceptor interaction: a &#963;&#8208;donation from the &#963;CO into the empty p&#8208;orbital of silicon, and a &#960;&#8208;back donation from the sp2 lone pair of silicon into the &#960;*CO antibonding orbitals. Notably, it was established that the driving force behind the surprisingly stable Si&#8722;CO compounds, however, is another &#960;&#8208;back donation from a perpendicular bonding R&#8722;Si &#963;&#8208;orbital into the &#960;*CO antibonding orbitals. Consequently, the pyramidalization of the central silicon atom cannot be associated with the strength of the &#960;&#8208;back donation, in sharp contrast to the established chemical bonding model. Considering this additional bonding interaction not only shed light on the bonding situation, but is also an indispensable key for broadening the scope of silylene&#8208;carbonyl chemistry.

         <title>Lewis Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions: Reactivity Trends across the Periodic Table</title>

Periodic reactivity trends! Quantum chemical activation strain analyses reveal how various weakly interacting Lewis acids across the periodic table, based on hydrogen, pnictogen, chalcogen, and halogen bonds, accelerate the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between 1,3&#8208;butadiene and methyl acrylate by amplifying the degree of asynchronicity and reducing the Pauli repulsion between the reactants.







Abstract
The catalytic effect of various weakly interacting Lewis acids (LAs) across the periodic table, based on hydrogen (Group&#8197;1), pnictogen (Group&#8197;15), chalcogen (Group&#8197;16), and halogen (Group&#8197;17) bonds, on the Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition reaction between 1,3&#8208;butadiene and methyl acrylate was studied quantum chemically by using relativistic density functional theory. Weakly interacting LAs accelerate the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction by lowering the reaction barrier up to 3&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 compared to the uncatalyzed reaction. The reaction barriers systematically increase from halogen&lt;hydrogen&lt;chalcogen&lt;pnictogen&#8208;bonded LAs, i.&#8201;e., the latter have the least catalytic effect. Our detailed activation strain and Kohn&#8208;Sham molecular orbital analyses reveal that these LAs lower the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction barrier by increasing the asynchronicity of the reaction to relieve the otherwise destabilizing Pauli repulsion between the closed&#8208;shell filled &#960;&#8208;orbitals of diene and dienophile. Notably, the reactivity can be further enhanced on going from a Period 3 to a Period 5 LA, as these species amplify the asynchronicity of the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction due to a stronger binding to the dienophile. These findings again demonstrate the generality of the Pauli repulsion&#8208;lowering catalysis concept.

&#8216;Power'ful Aminations. A simple transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free direct electrolytic amination strategy has been developed. The transformation takes place in the absence of any electrocatalyst by using cheap and easily available graphite electrodes. The reaction allows for the synthesis of carbazole derivatives via intramolecular C&#8722;H amination and also cross&#8208;coupling of (hetero)arenes and various N&#8208;arylamides in an undivided cell set up. The usage of an acidic solvent was beneficial as it eliminated the requirement of additional supporting electrolytes for the electrolysis.







Abstract
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free direct electrolytic C&#8722;H amination involving an electrochemically generated nitrenium ion intermediate has been developed. The electrosynthesis takes place in the absence of any organoiodine catalysts and is enabled by an in&#8197;situ generated electrolyte. A novel, efficient intramolecular and intermolecular C&#8722;H amination has been demonstrated using a simple reaction setup.

         <title>Synthesis of Difluoroglycine Derivatives from Amines, Difluorocarbene, and CO2: Computational Design, Scope, and Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A three&#8208;component reaction (3CR) for the synthesis of difluoroglycine derivatives has been achieved using amines, difluorocarbene (generated  in situ  ), and the abundant, inexpensive, and non&#8208;toxic C1 source CO  2  . Various  tert  &#8208;amines and pyridine, (iso)quinoline, imidazole, thiazole, and pyrazole derivatives were incorporated, and the corresponding products were isolated in solid form without purification using column chromatography on silica gel. Detailed reaction profiles of the 3CR were obtained via computational analysis using DFT calculations, and the results critically suggest that simple ammonia is not applicable to this reaction. In addition, strongly supported by computational predictions, a new reagent that can generate difluorocarbene at 0 &#176;C without any additives was discovered. Furthermore, radical substitution reactions of the obtained difluoroglycine derivatives under photoredox conditions, as well as a synthetic application as an  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand are shown.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The reaction of  in situ  generated arynes with stannylated imines to provide  ortho  &#8208;stannyl&#8208;aniline derivatives is reported. The readily prepared trimethylstannyl benzophenone imine is introduced as an efficient reagent to realize the aryne &#963;&#8208;insertion reaction. The imine functionality is an established N&#8208;protecting group and insertions proceed with good yields and good to excellent regioselectivities. The product anilines are valuable starting materials for follow&#8208;up chemistry thanks to the rich chemistry offered by the trimethylstannyl moiety.</dc:description>

         <title>Building an Iron Chromophore Incorporating Prussian Blue Analogue for Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The replacement of traditional ruthenium&#8208;based photosensitizers with low&#8208;cost and abundant iron analogs is a key step for the advancement of scalable and sustainable dye&#8208;sensitized water splitting cells. Herein this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, we utilize a pyridinium ligand coordinated pentacyanoferrate(II) chromophore to construct a cyanide&#8208;based CoFe extended bulk framework, in which the iron photosensitizer units are connected to cobalt water oxidation catalytic sites through cyanide linkers. The iron&#8208;sensitized photoanode exhibits exceptional stability for at least 5 hours at pH 7 and features its photosensitizing ability with an incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;current conversion capacity up to 500 nm with nanosecond scale excited state lifetime. Ultrafast transient absorption and computational studies reveal that iron and cobalt sites mutually support each other for charge separation via short bridging cyanide groups and for injection to the semiconductor in our proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept photoelectrochemical device. The reorganization of the excited states due to the mixing of electronic states of metal&#8208;based orbitals subsequently tailor the electron transfer cascade during the photoelectrochemical process. This breakthrough in chromophore&#8208;catalyst assemblies will spark interest in dye&#8208;sensitization with robust bulk systems for photoconversion applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton&#8208;transfer Dynamics of Photoacidic Merocyanines in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoacids attract increasing scientific attention, as they are valuable tools to spatiotemporally control proton&#8208;release reactions and pH values of solutions. We present the first time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic study of the excited state and proton&#8208;release dynamics of prominent merocyanine representatives. Femtosecond transient absorption measurements of a pyridine merocyanine with two distinct protonation sites revealed dissimilar proton&#8208;release mechanisms: one site acts as a photoacid generator as its pK  a  value is modulated in the ground state after photoisomerization, while the other functions as an excited state photoacid which releases its proton within 1.1 ps. With a pK  a  drop of 8.7 units to &#8208;5.5 upon excitation, the latter phenolic site is regarded a super&#8208;photoacid. The 6&#8208;nitro derivative exhibits only a phenolic site with similar, yet slightly less photoacidic characteristics and both compounds transfer their proton to methanol and ethanol. In contrast, for the related 6,8&#8208;dinitro compound an intramolecular proton transfer to the  ortho  &#8208;nitro group is suggested that is involved in a rapid relaxation into the ground state.</dc:description>

The 6&#8208;nitro derivative exhibits only a phenolic site with similar, yet slightly less photoacidic characteristics and both compounds transfer their proton to methanol and ethanol. In contrast, for the related 6,8&#8208;dinitro compound an intramolecular proton transfer to the  ortho  &#8208;nitro group is suggested that is involved in a rapid relaxation into the ground state.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inherent Ethyl Acetate Selectivity in a&#160;Trianglimine Molecular Solid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ethyl acetate is an important chemical raw material and solvent. It is also a key volatile organic compound in the brewing industry and a marker for lung cancer. Materials that are highly selective toward ethyl acetate are needed for its separation and detection. Here, we report a trianglimine macrocycle ( TAMC ) that selectively adsorbs ethyl acetate by forming a solvate. Crystal structure prediction showed this to be the lowest energy solvate structure available. This solvate leaves a metastable, &#8216;templated&#8217; cavity after solvent removal. Adsorption and breakthrough experiments confirmed that imprinted TAMC has adequate adsorption kinetics to separate ethyl acetate from azeotropic mixtures with ethanol, which is a challenging and energy&#8208;intensive industrial separation.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystal Structures of AlCr2 and MoSi2: Same Structure Type vs Different Bonding Pattern</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In a joint effort utilizing modified sample preparation, microscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction and micro&#8208;fabrication, it became possible to prepare single crystals of the &#8220;hidden&#8221; phase AlCr  2  . High&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis is described in detail for two crystals with the similar overall composition, but different degree of disorder, which seems to be the main cause for the differing unit cell parameters. Chemical bonding analysis of AlCr  2  in comparison to prototypical MoSi  2  shows pronounced differences reflecting the interchange of main group element vs. transition metal as majority component.</dc:description>

         <title>An Environmentally Friendly, Photochemical Access to [N^C^N]Au(III) Pincer Complexes by Oxidative Addition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Starting from commercially available DMSAuCl and diazonium salts, cationic [N^C^N]Au(III) complexes were synthesized in a selective, photosensitizer&#8208;free, photochemical reaction by irradiation with blue LED light. This new protocol represents the first easy synthesis of these types of pincer&#8208;complexes in moderate to excellent yield starting from a readily available gold(I) precursor with nitrogen as the only byproduct. Owing to the disadvantages of known protocols, especially the toxicity in case of a transmetallation with mercury or the necessity for a mostly twofold excess of a gold precursor, this method offers an attractive alternative towards this kind of gold(III) complexes. In addition, the first arylated [N^C^N]Au(III) pincer&#8208;complex was synthesized by using this technology.</dc:description>

         <title>1,2&#8208; or 1,3&#8208;Hydride Shifts &#8211; What controls Guaiane Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A systematic computational study addressing the entire chemical space of guaianes in conjunction with an analysis of all known compounds shows that 1,3&#8208;hydride shifts are rare events in guaiane biosynthesis. As demonstrated here, 1,3&#8208;hydride shifts towards guaianes can only be realized for two stereochemically well defined out of numerous possible stereoisomeric skeletons. One example is given by the mechanism of guaia&#8208;4(15)&#8208;en&#8208;11&#8208;ol synthase from California poplar, an enzyme that yields guaiane sesquiterpenes with unusual stereochemical properties. The generalizing results from DFT calculations were experimentally verified through isotopic labeling experiments with guaia&#8208;4(15)&#8208;en&#8208;11&#8208;ol synthase.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Guanidine&#8208;Based Hybrid Perovskite with Strong Dichroism for Multiwavelength Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites, benefiting from their natural anisotropy of quantum&#8208;well motifs and optical properties, have shown remarkable polarization&#8208;dependent responses superior to the 3D counterparts. Here, for the first time, we fabricated the multiwavelength polarization&#8208;sensitive detectors using single crystals of a guanidine&#8208;based 2D hybrid perovskite, (BA)  2  (GA)Pb  2  I  7  (where BA  +  is  n  &#8208;butylammonium and GA  +  is guanidium). Its unique 2D quantum&#8208;well structure results in strong crystallographic&#8208;dependence of optical absorption. Strikingly, our crystal&#8208;based photodetector exhibits a prominent photocurrent dichroic ratio (  I  max  /  I  min  ) of ~2.2 at 520 nm, higher than the typical 2D inorganic materials (GeSe, ~1.09, PdSe  2  , ~1.8). Besides, notable dichroic ratios of 1.29 and 1.23 at 405 nm and 637 nm are also created for the multiwavelength polarized&#8208;light detection. The prominent detecting performances, including low dark current (1.6&#215;10  &#8208;11  A), considerable on/off ratio (~2&#215;10  3  ), high photodetectivity (~3.3&#215;10  11  Jones) and responsivity (~12.01 mA&#183;W  &#8208;1  ), make (BA)  2  (GA)Pb  2  I  7  a promising candidate for polarized&#8208;light detection. This work sheds light on the rational engineering of new 2D hybrid perovskites for the high&#8208;performance optoelectronic device applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Enzyme Design without Structural Knowledge: A Sequence&#8208;Based Approach for Efficient Generation of Transglycosylases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycobiology is dogged by the relative scarcity of synthetic, defined oligosaccharides. Enzyme&#8208;catalysed glycosylation using glycoside hydrolases is feasible but is hampered by the innate hydrolytic activity of these enzymes. Protein engineering is useful to remedy this, but it usually requires prior structural knowledge of the target enzyme, and/or relies on extensive, time&#8208;consuming screening and analysis. Here we describe a straightforward strategy that involves rational rapid  in silico  analysis of protein sequences. The method pinpoints 6&#8210;12 single mutant candidates to improve transglycosylation yields. Requiring very little prior knowledge of the target enzyme other than its sequence, the method is generic and procures catalysts for the formation of glycosidic bonds involving various  d  /  l  &#8208;, &#945;/&#946;&#8208;pyranosides or furanosides, and  exo  &#8208; and  endo  &#8208;action. Moreover, mutations validated in one enzyme can be transposed to others, even distantly related enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic DNA&#8208; and protein&#8208;based recognition promote an RNA&#8208;templated bio&#8208;orthogonal reaction</title>

         <dc:description>Biomolecular assemblies composed of proteins and oligonucleotides play a central role in biological processes. While in nature, oligonucleotides and proteins usually assemble via non&#8208;covalent interactions, synthetic conjugates have been developed which covalently link both modalities. The resulting peptide&#8208;oligonucleotide conjugates have facilitated novel biological applications as well as the design of functional supramolecular systems and materials. However, despite the importance of concerted protein/oligonucleotide recognition in nature, conjugation approaches have barely utilized the synergistic recognition abilities of such complexes. Herein, we report the structure&#8208;based design of peptide&#8208;DNA conjugates which bind RNA through Watson&#8208;Crick base pairing combined with peptide&#8208;mediated major groove recognition. Two distinct conjugate families with tunable binding characteristics have been designed to adjacently bind a particular RNA sequence. In the resulting ternary complex, their peptide elements are located in proximity, a feature that was used to enable an RNA&#8208;templated click reaction. The introduced structure&#8208;based design approach opens the door to novel functional biomolecular assemblies.</dc:description>

         <title>Vacant Manganese&#8208;Based Perovskite Fluorides@Reduced Graphene Oxides for Na&#8208;ion Storage with Pseudocapacitive Conversion/Insertion Dual Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Na&#8208;ion capacitors  (NICs) and Na&#8208;ion&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion batteries (Na&#8208;DIBs) have been considered to be promising alternatives to traditional lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) because of Na&#8208;ion abundance and low cost, but their energy density, power density and cycle life are limited.  Herein, d  ual vacancies (including K  +  and F  &#8208;  vacancies) perovskite fluoride K  0.86  MnF  2.69  @  reduced graphene oxide  (rGO) (recorded as Mn&#8208;G) as anode for NICs and Na&#8208;DIBs have been developed. The special conversion/intercalation dual Na&#8208;ion  energy storage mechanism  and pseudocapacitive dynamics are analyzed in detail.  The Mn&#8208;G//AC NICs and Mn&#8208;G//KS6 Na&#8208;DIBs delivered  a maximum energy density of 92.7 Wh kg  &#8208;1  and 187.6 Wh kg  &#8208;1  , maximum power density of 20.2 kW kg  &#8208;1  and 21.12 kW kg  &#8208;1  , and long cycle performance of 61.3% and 68.4% after 1000 cycles at 5 A g  &#8208;1  , respectively. Moreover, Mn&#8208;G//AC NICs  and Mn&#8208;G//KS6 Na&#8208;DIBs can work well in a wide range of temperatures (&#8208;20&#8208;40 &#176;C).  This result makes it competitive in Na&#8208;ion storage applications with high energy/power density in a wide temperature range.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Direct Electrochemical Methanol Reforming Enabled by CO&#8208;Immune Mo&#8208;based Hydrogen Evolution Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen storage in the form of intermediate artificial fuels such as methanol is important for future chemical and energy applications, and the electrochemical regeneration of hydrogen from methanol is thermodynamically favorable compared to direct water splitting. However, CO produced from methanol oxidation can adsorb to H  2  evolution catalysts and drastically reduce catalyst activity. In this study, we report and explore the origins of CO immunity in Mo&#8208;containing H  2  evolution catalysts. Unlike conventional catalysts such as Pt or Ni, Mo&#8208;based catalysts display remarkable immunity to CO poisoning. The origin of this behavior in NiMo appears to arise from the apparent inability of CO to bind Mo in electrocatalytic conditions, with mechanistic consequences for the HER in these systems. This specific property of Mo&#8208;based HER catalysts makes them ideal in environments where poisons may be present.</dc:description>

         <title>Co3O4&#8208;CeO2 nanocomposites for Low Temperature CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In an effort to combine the favorable catalytic properties of Co3O4 and CeO2, nanocomposites with different phase distribution and Co3O4 loading were prepared and employed for CO oxidation. Synthesizing Co3O4&#8208;modified CeO2 via three different sol&#8208;gel based routes, each with 10.4 wt% Co3O4 loading, yielded three different nanocomposite morphologies: CeO2&#8208;supported Co3O4 layers, intermixed oxides and homogeneously dispersed Co. The reactivity of the resulting surface oxygen species towards CO were examined by temperature programmed reduction (CO&#8208;TPR) and flow reactor kinetic tests. The first morphology exhibited the best performance due to its active Co3O4 surface layer, reducing the light&#8208;off temperature of CeO2 by about 200 &#8451;. In contrast, intermixed oxides and Co&#8208;doped CeO2 suffered from lower dispersion and organic residues, respectively. The performance of Co3O4&#8208;CeO2 nanocomposites was optimized by varying the Co3O4 loading, characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and N2 sorption (BET). The 16&#8208;65 wt% Co3O4&#8208;CeO2 catalysts approached the conversion of 1 wt% Pt/CeO2, rendering them interesting candidates for low temperature CO oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Distorted Porphyrins with High Stability: Synthesis and Characteristic Electronic Properties of Mono&#8208; and Di&#8208;Nuclear Tricarbonyl Rhenium Tetraazaporphyrin Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mono&#8208; and di&#8208;nuclear tricarbonyl Re(I) tetraazaporphyrin complexes (  Re&#8321;TAP  and  Re&#8322;TAP  ) are investigated and compared with Re(I) phthalocyanine complexes (  Re&#8321;Pc  and  Re&#8322;Pc  ). Although  Re&#8322;Pc  is unstable in polar solvents, which easily undergoes demetallation reaction, the coordination of the TAP ligand significantly improves the tolerance toward polar solvents, affording more stability to  Re&#8322;TAP  . Additionally, the incorporation of [Re(CO)&#8323;]  +  unit(s) and the TAP ligand results in remarkable positive shifts in both oxidation and reduction potentials. Consequently, the more positive oxidation potentials of the ReTAP complexes significantly increase the tolerance toward oxidation, while the reduction potential indicates that  Re&#8322;TAP  is suitable for a soluble electron acceptor. In contrast to  Re&#8321;Pc  and  Re&#8322;Pc  ,  Re&#8321;TAP  and  Re&#8322;TAP  show unique broad Q bands, which can be attributed to the admixture of the &#960;&#8211;&#960;* and metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer characters, owing to the lowered &#960; orbital energy in the TAP complexes.&#160;This study is useful for controlling electronic properties and realizing high stability in Pc analogues.</dc:description>

         <title>Porous Tungsten Oxide: Recent Advances in Design, Synthesis&#160;and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tungsten oxide (WO3) has grown continuous attention and has been highly researched over the last decade credited to being a low&#8208;cost transition metal semiconductor with a tunable yet widely stable band gaps. This minireview briefly highlights design and synthesis&#160; challenges of porous WO3  &#160;including methods, precursors, solvents effects, crystal phase, and &#160;the surface activity of the porous WO3  base material. These topics are explored while also drawing a connection of how the morphology and crystal phase affect the band gap. The shifts in band gap not only impacts the optical properties of tungsten but also allows&#160; tuning to operate on different energy levels which makes WO3  highly desirable in many applications such as supercapacitors, batteries, solar cells, catalysts, sensors, smart windows, and bio&#8208;applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoretentive N&#8208;Arylation of Amino Acid Esters with Cyclohexanones Utilizing a Continuous&#8208;Flow System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The N&#8208;arylation of chiral amino acid esters with minimal racemization is a challenging transformation because of the sensitivity of the &#945;&#8208;stereocenter. We developed a versatile synthetic method to prepare N&#8208;arylated amino acid esters using cyclohexanones as aryl sources under continuous&#8208;flow conditions. The designed flow system, which consists of a coil reactor and a packed&#8208;bed reactor containing a Pd(OH)2/C catalyst, efficiently afforded the desired N&#8208;arylated amino acids without significant racemization, accompanied by only small amounts of easily removable co&#8208;products (i.e., H2O and alkanes). The efficiency and robustness of this method allowed for the continuous synthesis of the desired product in very high yield and enantiopurity with high space&#8208;time yield (74.1 g L&#8211;1 h&#8211;1) and turnover frequency (5.9 h&#8211;1) for at least 3 days.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel WS  2  /Fe  0.95  S  1.05  &#160;Hierarchical Nanosphere as a Highly Efficient Electrocatalyst for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Fe  0.95  S  1.05  &#160;with high reactivity and stability was incorporated into WS  2  &#160;nanosheets  via  &#160;a one&#8208;step hydrothermal method for the first time. The resulted hybrid catalyst has much higher catalytic activity than WS  2  &#160;and Fe  0.95  S  1.05  &#160;alone, and the optimal WS  2  /Fe  0.95  S  1.05  &#160;hybrid catalyst was found by adjusting the feed ratio. We proved that the addition of Fe  0.95  S  1.05  &#160;can enhance the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of WS  2  , and vice versa. At the same time, it was found that the catalytic effect of the hybrid catalyst was the best when the feed ratio was W:Fe=2:1. In other words, we confirmed that there is a synergistic effect between W&#8208; and Fe&#8208;based sulfide hybrid catalysts, and validated that the reason for the improved HER performance is the strong interaction between the two in the middle sulfur. WS  2  /Fe  0.95  S  1.05  &#160;hybrid catalyst leads to enhanced HER activity, which shows&#160;a low overpotential of ~&#160;0.172&#160;V at 10 mA&#160;cm  &#8208;  2  , low&#160;Tafel slope of ~&#160;53.47 mV/decade. This study supplies innovative synthesis of a highly active WS  2  /Fe  0.95  S  1.05  &#160;hybrid catalyst for HER.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Control of Peptide Conformation with Light and Metal&#8208;Coordination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the design of a stimuli&#8208;responsive peptide whose conformation is controlled by wavelength&#8208;specific light and metal coordination. The peptide adopts a defined tertiary structure whose conformation can be modulated between an &#945;&#8208;helical coiled coil and &#946;&#8208;sheet. The peptide is designed with a hydrophobic interface to induce coiled coil formation and is based on a recently described strategy to obtain switchable helix dimers. Here, we endowed the helix dimer with 8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline (HQ) groups to achieve metal coordination and a shift to a &#946;&#8208;sheet structure. We find that the conformational shift only occurs upon introduction of Zn  2+  . The other metal ions (Cu  2+  , Fe  3+  , Co  2+  , Mg  2+  and Ni  2+  ) do not offer switching likely due to non&#8208;specific metal&#8208;peptide coordination. A control peptide lacking the metal&#8208;coordinating residues does not show conformational switching with Zn  2+  supporting the role of this metal in stabilizing the &#946;&#8208;sheet conformation in a defined manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Accessing C2&#8208;Functionalized 1,3&#8208;(Benz)azolesthrough Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The skeletal presence of 1,3&#8208;azoles in a variety of bioactive natural products, pharmacophores, and organic materials demands the derivatization of such heteroarenes regioselectively. Plenty of cross&#8208;coupling as well as cyclocondensation reactions have been performed to build up these skeletons but remained commercially unrealizable. A couple of severe drawbacks are faced by these traditional protocols that require a more straightforward strategy to obviate them. Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H functionalization has emerged as a superior alternative in that context. 1,3&#8208;azoles and their benzo counterparts have been extensively functionalized exploiting both noble and earth&#8208;abundant transition metals. Lately, C&#8208;2 functionalizations have gained much traction due to the ease of attaining high regioselectivity and installation of synthetically manipulative functionalities. This critical review presents a bird's eye view of all major C&#8208;2 functionalizations of (benz)azoles catalyzed by a diverse set of metals performed over the past 15 years.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship for Di&#8208; up to Tetranuclear Macrocyclic Ruthenium Catalysts in Homogeneous Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have synthesized two di&#8208; and tetranuclear Ru(bda) (bda: 2,2'&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;6,6'&#8208;dicarboxylate) macrocyclic complexes and investigated their catalytic activities in chemical and photochemical water oxidation in a comparative manner to our previously reported trinuclear congener. Our studies have shown that the catalytic activities of this homologous series of multinuclear Ru(bda) macrocycles in homogeneous water oxidation are dependent on their size, exhibiting highest efficiencies for the largest tetranuclear catalyst. The turnover frequencies (TOFs) have increased from di&#8208; to tetranuclear macrocycles not only per catalyst molecule but more importantly also per Ru unit with TOF of 6 s&#8208;1 to 8.7 s&#8208;1 and 10.5 s&#8208;1 in chemical and 0.6 s&#8208;1 to 3.3 s&#8208;1 and 5.8 s&#8208;1 in photochemical water oxidation per Ru unit, respectively. Thus, for the first time, a clear structure&#8208;activity relationship could be established for this novel class of macrocyclic water oxidation catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>From BN Naphthalenes to Benzoborole Dianions</title>

         <dc:description>The synthesis of benzoborole polyanions by alkali metal reduction of BN&#8208;naphthalene derivatives via a ring&#8208;contraction strategy has been developed. Reduction of 1&#8208;alkynyl 2,1&#8208;benzazaborine 1a in Et2O led to the elimination of alkynyllithium with the formation of 1&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;benzoborole trilithium salt 2a, whereas reduction of 1&#8208;phenyl 2,1&#8208;benzazaborine 1c in THF yielded 1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1&#8208;benzoborole dilithium salt 2c with the elimination of ArNHLi. The trilithium and dilithium salts 2a and 2c have been fully characterized. Treatment of trilithium salt 2a with Et3NHCl led to the selective protonation of the amino lithium to afford the dilithium salt 2aH, which could be cleanly oxidized to 1&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;benzoborole 3 in excellent yield. Reaction of 1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1&#8208;benzoborole dilithium salt 2c with MeI yielded the lithium borate 4c, which is luminescent both in solution and in the solid state.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoresponsive Binding Dynamics in High&#8208;Affinity Cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;Dithienylethene Host&#8208;Guest Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of external stimuli to control the binding kinetics in supramolecular systems is of critical importance for the development of advanced molecular machines and devices. In this work we report a study focused on the kinetics of a water&#8208;soluble host&#8208;guest system based on cucurbit[8]uril and two dithienylethene (DTE) photoswitches. We show that for the DTE guest comprising two anionic sulfonate side arms appended to pyridinium moieties, the formation/dissociation of the pseudorotaxane structures is slowed down by more than 100000&#8208;fold with respect to its bipyridinium analogue. The decrease in ingression rate leads to the emergence of a competitive metastable product with the open DTE isomer that has an important influence in the overall binding kinetics. We also demonstrate that host&#8208;guest dissociation kinetics is approximately 100&#8208;fold slower for the closed DTE isomer (t  1/2  = 107 hours vs t  1/2  = 1.2 hours for the open isomer) allowing control over the dissociation rate with light.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural, Magnetic and Catalytic Properties of a New Vacancy Ordered Perovskite Type Barium Cobaltate BaCoO2.67</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new vacancy ordered, anion deficient perovskite modification with composition of BaCoO  2.67  (Ba  3  Co  3  O  8  &#9633;  1  ) has been prepared via a two&#8208;step heating process. Combined Rietveld analysis of neutron and X&#8208;ray powder diffraction data shows a novel ordering of oxygen vacancies not known before for barium cobaltates. A combination of neutron powder diffraction, magnetic measurements and density functional theory (DFT) studies confirms G&#8208;type antiferromagnetic ordering. From impedance measurements, the electronic conductivity of the order of 10  &#8722;4  S cm  &#8722;1  is determined. Remarkably, the bifunctional catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is found to be comparable to that of Ba  0.5  Sr  0.5  Co  0.8  Fe  0.2  O  3&#8722;  y  , confirming that charge&#8208;ordered anion deficient non&#8208;cubic perovskites can be highly efficient catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable Production of Ambient Stable Hybrid Bismuth&#8208;based Materials: AACVD of Phenethylammonium Bismuth Iodide Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Large homogeneous and adherent coatings of phenethylammonium bismuth iodide were produced using the cost&#8208;effective and scalable aerosol&#8208;assisted chemical vapour deposition (AACVD) methodology. The film morphology was found to depend on the deposition conditions and substrates, resulting in different optical properties to those reported from their spin&#8208;coated counterparts. Optoelectronic characterization revealed band bending effects occurring between the hybrid material and semiconducting substrates (TiO2 and FTO) due to heterojunction formation, and the optical bandgap of the hybrid material was calculated from UV&#8208;visible and PL spectrometry to be 2.05 eV. Maximum values for hydrophobicity and crystallographic preferential orientation were observed for films deposited on FTO/glass substrates, closely followed by values from films deposited on TiO2/glass substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Experimental and Computational Models for Side Chain Discrimination in Peptide&#8208;Protein Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A bis(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6) Tr&#246;ger's base receptor and 4&#8208;substituted hepta&#8208;1,7&#8208;diyl bisammonium salt ligands have been used as a model system to study the interactions between non&#8208;polar side chains of peptides and an aromatic cavity of a protein. NMR titrations and NOESY/ROESY NMR spectroscopy were used to analyze the discrimination of the ligands by the receptor based on the substituent of the ligand, both quantitatively (free binding energies) and qualitatively (conformations). The analysis showed that an all&#8208;anti conformation of the heptane chain was preferred for most of the ligands, both free and when bound to the receptor, and that for all of the receptor&#8208;ligand complexes, the substituent was located inside or partly inside of the aromatic cavity of the receptor. We estimated the free binding energy of a methyl&#8208; and a phenyl group to an aromatic cavity, via CH&#8208;&#960;, and combined aromatic CH&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions to be &#8722;1.7 and &#8722;3.3 kJ mol&#8722;1, respectively. The experimental results were used to assess the accuracy of different computational methods, including molecular mechanics (MM) and density functional theory (DFT) methods, showing that MM was superior.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolation of a Uranium(III)&#8208;Carbon Multiple Bond Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low&#8208;valent uranium&#8208;element multiple bond complexes are scarce, though there is burgeoning interest regarding to their bonding and reactivity. Herein, isolation of a uranium(III)&#8208;carbon double bond complex [(Cp*) 2 U(CDP)](BPh 4 ) ( 1 ) comprising a tridentate carbodiphosphorane (CDP) as ligand is reported for the first time. Oxidation of 1 afforded the corresponding U(IV) complex [(Cp*) 2 U(CDP)](BPh 4 ) 2 ( 2 ). The interatomic distance between U and C in 2 is 2.481 &#197;, indicating a typical U=C double bond, which is further confirmed by quantum chemical &#160; calculations. Bonding analysis suggests that the CDP ligand serves as both &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;donor in complex 1 where a longer U&#8208;C bond (2.666(3) &#197;) is observed. The results indicate that 1 is the first mononuclear uranium(III) carbene complex that could be isolated. These results suggest that CDPs are promising ligands to establish other low&#8208;valent f &#8208;block metal&#8208;carbon multiple bond complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Mn3&#8208;xFexO4 Hollow Nanostructures for High&#8208;Performance Asymmetric Supercapacitor Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Design of hollow nanostructure and controllable phase of mixed metal oxides for improving performance in supercapacitor applications is highly desirable. Here we demonstrate the rational design and synthesis of Mn  3&#8208;x  Fe  x  O  4  hollow nanostructures for supercapacitor applications. Owing to high porosity and the specific surface area that provides more active sites for electrochemical reactions, the electrochemical performance of Mn  3&#8208;x  Fe  x  O  4  hollow nanostructure substantially enhances comparing with pristine Mn  3  O  4  . Particularly, in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, Mn  0.16  Fe  2.84  O  4  with a typical diameter of 20 nm exhibits excellent specific capacitance of 2675, 2320, 1662, 987 Fg  &#8208;1  at current densities of 1, 2, 5, 10 Ag  &#8208;1  , respectively, which is significantly superior to those of other transition metal oxides. Besides, an asymmetric supercapacitor is assembled by using Mn  0.16  Fe  2.84  O  4  and activated carbon as a positive and a negative electrode, respectively. Electrochemical results indicate a high energy density of 42 Wh kg  &#8208;1  at a power density of 0.75 kW kg  &#8208;1  , which makes this hollow nanostructure a highly promising electrode for achieving high&#8208;performance next&#8208;generation supercapacitors.</dc:description>

         <title>Accessing Improbable Foldamer Shapes with Strained Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The alkylation of some secondary amide functions with a dimethoxybenzyl (DMB) group in oligomers of 8&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;quinolinecarboxylic acid destabilizes the otherwise favored helical conformations, and allows for cyclization to take place. A cyclic hexamer and a cyclic heptamer were produced in this manner. After DMB removal, X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR show that the macrocycles adopt strained conformations that would be improbable in non&#8208;cyclic species. The high helix folding propensity of the main chain is partly expressed in these conformations, but it remains frustrated by macrocyclization. Despite being homomeric, the macrocycles possess inequivalent monomer units. Experimental and computational studies highlight specific fluxional pathways within these structures. Extensive simulated annealing molecular dynamics allow for the prediction of the conformations for larger macrocycles with up to sixteen monomers.</dc:description>

         <title>Affinity selections of DNA&#8208;encoded chemical libraries on carbonic anhydrase IX&#8208;expressing tumor cells reveal a dependence on ligand valence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA&#8208;encoded chemical libraries are typically screened against purified protein targets. Recently, cell&#8208;based selections with encoded chemical libraries have been described, commonly revealing suboptimal performance due to insufficient recovery of binding molecules. We used carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX)&#8208;expressing tumor cells as a model system to optimize selection procedures with code&#8208;specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) as selection readout. Salt concentration and performing PCR on cell suspension had the biggest impact on selection performance, leading to 15&#8208;fold enrichment factors for high&#8208;affinity monovalent CAIX binders (acetazolamide; K  D  = 8.7 nM). Surprisingly, the homobivalent display of acetazolamide at the extremities of both complementary DNA strands led to a substantial improvement of both ligand recovery and enrichment factors (above 100&#8208;fold). The optimized procedures were used for selections with a DNA&#8208;encoded chemical library comprising 1 million members against tumor cell lines expressing CAIX, leading to a preferential recovery of known and new ligands against this validated tumor&#8208;associated target. This work may facilitate future affinity selections on cells against target proteins which might be difficult to express otherwise.</dc:description>
