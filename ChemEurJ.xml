         <title>Total Synthesis and Structure Correction of the Cyclic Lipodepsipeptide Orfamide A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the total synthesis of orfamide A an efficient synthesis format for cyclic lipodepsipeptide natural products on solid phase was developed. A strategy using side chain anchoring, an ester building block, and O&#8594;N acyl migration suppression enabled high&#8208;yielding synthesis on solid support and facilitated compound library synthesis. The configuration of the proposed structure of orfamide A was corrected at two positions. Studies in Chlamydomonas algae uncovered the impact of orfamide A stereochemistry on compound bioactivity.







Abstract
A total synthesis of the cyclic lipodepsipeptide natural product orfamide A was achieved. By developing a synthesis format using an aminoacid ester building block and SPPS protocol adaptation, a focused library of target compounds was obtained, in high yield and purity. Spectral and LC&#8208;HRMS data of all library members with the isolated natural product identified the 5Leu residue to be d&#8208; and the 3&#8217;&#8208;OH group to be R&#8208;configured. The structural correction of orfamide A by chemical synthesis and analysis was confirmed by biological activity comparison in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, which indicated compound configuration to be important for bioactivity. Acute toxicity was also found against Trypanosoma brucei, the parasite causing African sleeping sickness.

         <title>Transition metal doping induces Ti3+ to promote the performance of SrTiO3@TiO2 visible light photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to prepare C1 product</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The transition metal Fe, Co, Ni and Cu doped strontium titanate&#8208;rich SrTiO  3  @TiO  2  (STO@T) materials were prepared by hydrothermal method. The prepared doped materials exhibit better photocatalytic CO  2  reduction to CH  4  ability under visible light conditions. Among them, Fe&#8208;doped and undoped SrTiO  3  @TiO  2  under visible light conditions CO  2  reduction products only CO, while M&#8208;STO@T (M=Co, Ni, Cu) samples converted CO  2  to CH  4  . The average methane yield of Ni&#8208;doped STO@T samples are as high as 73.85 &#956;mol&#183;g  &#8208;1  &#183;h  &#8208;1  . The production of methane is mainly due to the increase in the response of the doped samples to visible light. And the increase in the separation rate of photogenerated electrons and holes and the efficiency of electron transport caused by the generation of impurity levels. The impurity level caused by Ti  3+  plays an important role in the production of methane by CO  2  visible light reduction. Ni doping effectively improves the photocatalytic performance of STO@T and CO  2  reduction mechanism were explained.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymer Acceptors for High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) have attracted considerable attention owing to their pronounced advantages of excellent mechanical flexibility/stretchability and greatly enhanced device stability as compared to other types of organic solar cells (OSCs). Thanks to the extensive research efforts dedicated to the development of polymer acceptors, all&#8208;PSCs have achieved remarkable improvement of photovoltaic performance, recently. This review summarizes the recent progress o  f polymer acceptors based on the key electron&#8208;deficient building blocks,  which  include bithiophene diimide (BTI) derivatives,  boron&#8208;nitrogen coordination bond (B&#8592;N)&#8208;incorporated (hetero)arenes, cyano&#8208;functionalized (hetero)arenes, and fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (FREAs). In addition, single&#8208;component&#8208;based all&#8208;PSCs are also briefly discussed. The structure&#8208;property correlations of polymer acceptors are elaborated in details. Finally, we offer our insights into the development of new electron&#8208;deficient building blocks with further optimized properties and the polymers built from them for efficient all&#8208;PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>The non&#8208;ancillary nature of trimethylsilylamide substituents in boranes and borinium cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The known boranes [((R(Me  3  Si)N)  2  BF (R = Me  3  Si  1  , t  Bu  2  , C  6  F  5  3,  o&#8208;tol  4  , Mes  5  , Dipp  6  ) and borinium salts [((R(Me  3  Si)N)  2  B][B(C  6  F  5  )  4  ] (R = Me  3  Si  7  ,  t  Bu  8  ) are prepared and fully characterized. Compound  7  is shown to react with phosphines to generate [R  3  PSiMe  3  ]  +  and [R  3  PH]  +  (R = Me,  t  Bu). Efforts to generate related borinium cations via fluoride abstraction from ((R(Me  3  Si)N)  2  BF (R = C  6  F  5  3,  o&#8208;tol  4  , Mes  5  ) gave complex mixtures suggesting multiple reaction pathways. However for R = Dipp  6,  the species [(m&#8208;F)(SiMe  2  N(dipp))  2  BMe][B(C  6  F  5  )  4  ] was isolated as the major product, indicating methyl abstraction from silicon and F/Me exchange on boron. These observations together with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art DFT mechanistic studies reveal that the trimethylsilyl&#8208;substituents do not behave as ancillary subsitutents but rather act as sources of proton, SiMe  3  and methyl groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereodivergent Desymmetrization of Simple Dicarboxylates via Branch&#8208;Selective Pd/Cu Catalyzed Allylic Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric desymmetrization has been demonstrated to be a powerful strategy for building stereocenters in asymmetric synthesis. Herein, a Pd/Cu catalyzed asymmetric desymmetrization reaction with a simple geminal dicarboxylate is reported. A wide scope of imino esters bearing an aryl or heteroaromatic group were compatible with this bimetallic catalytic system. The reactions proceeded smoothly, giving the desired products in good yields with high to excellent regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivity (up to 20:1 B:L, &gt;20:1 dr, &gt;99% ee). Notably, the reaction favored branched selectivity, which is unusual for the Pd&#8208;catalyzed allylic alkylation reaction. In addition, the standard product could be easily transformed to other valuable molecules such as chiral allylic alcohols, carbamates, and organic boron compounds. Furthermore, DFT calculations were conducted to explain the origin of the branched selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Disclosing Cyclic(Alkyl)(Amino)Carbenes as a One&#8208;Electron Reductant: Synthesis of Acyclic(Amino)(Aryl)Carbene&#8208;Based Kekul&#233; Diradicaloids</title>

         <dc:description>Herein we disclose cyclic(alkyl)(amino)carbenes (CAACs) as a one&#8208;electron reductant under the formation of a transient radical cation as indicated by EPR spectroscopy. Subsequently, the disclosed CAAC reducing reactivity was utilized for the synthesis of acyclic(amino)(aryl)carbene&#8208;based Thiele and Chichibabin hydrocarbons, a new class of Kekul&#233; diradicaloids. The results demonstrate the CAAC to be a potent organic reductant. Notably, the acyclic(amino)(aryl)carbene&#8208;based Chichibabin&#8217;s hydrocarbon shows an appreciable population of the triplet state at room temperature, as evidenced by both variable temperature NMR and EPR spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Perovskite Photovoltaics for Artificial Light Harvesting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskites have encountered a growing interest as light&#8208;absorbing materials for harvesting and recycling ambient light. This interest comes from distinct and impressive intrinsic properties of these materials and is necessitated by the need for reliable and sustainable power supplies for wearable and portable internet of things (IoT) applications. Perovskite artificial light cells (PALCs; i.e., indoor perovskite photovoltaics) have been intensively explored, and thus their device performance has been rapidly augmented. In this review, we summarize and consolidate the research outputs of PALCs by focusing on the tuning of photo&#8208;absorber and interlayer materials for efficient harvest and collection of artificial light sources. We also emphasize various challenges and possible future research directions that should be addressed for realizing a large market uptake of PALCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;induced donor state destabilisation &#8211; a new route to panchromatically absorbing Cu(I) complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intense absorption of light to covering a large part of the visible spectrum is highly desirable for solar energy conversion schemes. To this end, we have developed novel anionic bis(4  H  &#8208;imidazolato)Cu(I) complexes (cuprates), which feature intense, panchromatic light absorption properties throughout the visible spectrum and into the NIR region with extinction coefficients up to 28,000&#160;M  &#8722;1  cm  &#8722;1  . Steady&#8208;state absorption, (spectro)electrochemical and theoretical investigations reveal low energy (Vis to NIR) metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer absorption bands, which are a consequence of destabilized copper&#8208;based donor states. These high&#8208;lying copper&#8208;based states are induced by the &#963;&#8208;donation of the chelating anionic ligands, which also feature low energy acceptor states. The optical properties are reflected in very low, copper&#8208;based oxidation potentials and three ligand&#8208;based reduction events. These electronic features reveal a new route to panchromatically absorbing Cu(I) complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable Surface Electric Field of Electrocatalysts via Constructing Schottky Heterojunctions for Selective Conversion of Trash Ions to Treasures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 14, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conceptually new method is proposed to tune the surface electric field of electrocatalysts by adjusting the number and density of heterojunctions inside. The well&#8208;designed surface electric field of an electrocatalyst plays a key role in facilitating pre&#8208;adsorption and/or activation of reactants for selective conversion of trash ions to useful products.







Abstract
Surface electric field of catalyst is widely recognized as one of the key points to boost catalytic activity. However, there is still a lack of convenient ways to tune the surface electric field to selectively boost the catalytic conversions of different types of reactants in specific catalytic reactions. Here, we introduce a conceptually new method to tune the surface electric field of electrode materials by adjusting the number and density of heterojunctions inside. Both theoretical and experimental results prove that the well&#8208;designed surface electric field of an electrocatalyst plays a key role in facilitating pre&#8208;adsorption and/or activation of reactants for selective conversion of trash ions to useful products in hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions as well as NOx&#8722; reduction reactions.

         <title>Unlocking the Hydrolytic Mechanism of GH92 &#945;&#8208;1,2&#8208;Mannosidases: Computation Inspires the use of C&#8208;Glycosides as Michaelis Complex Mimics</title>

Glycoside hydrolase 92 enzymes catalyze the degradation of N&#8208;glycans containing chains of &#945;&#8208;mannose. Since experiments with S&#8208;glycosides did not shed light about the conformation of the Michaelis complex (MC), we present a multidisciplinary work where computation and experiments demonstrate the reactive conformation adopted by the sugar in the MC. In addition, we demonstrate the power of C&#8208;glycosides as MC mimics.







Abstract
The conformational changes in a sugar moiety along the hydrolytic pathway are key to understand the mechanism of glycoside hydrolases (GHs) and to design new inhibitors. The two predominant itineraries for mannosidases go via OS2&#8594;B2,5&#8594;1S5 and 3S1&#8594;3H4&#8594;1C4. For the CAZy family 92, the conformational itinerary was unknown. Published complexes of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron GH92 catalyst with a S&#8208;glycoside and mannoimidazole indicate a 4C1&#8594;4H5/1S5&#8594;1S5 mechanism. However, as observed with the GH125 family, S&#8208;glycosides may not act always as good mimics of GH's natural substrate. Here we present a cooperative study between computations and experiments where our results predict the E5&#8594;B2,5/1S5&#8594;1S5 pathway for GH92 enzymes. Furthermore, we demonstrate the Michaelis complex mimicry of a new kind of C&#8208;disaccharides, whose biochemical applicability was still a chimera.

         <title>Expedient Synthesis of Oxaboracyclic Compounds Based on Naphthalene and Biphenyl Backbone and Phase&#8208;Dependent Luminescence of their Chelate Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 14, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
General synthetic routes to a series of six&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered boracyclic systems based on naphthalene and biphenyl backbones were developed.

Abstract
The approach to a series of six&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered oxaboraheterocycles based on naphthalene or biphenyl backbones was developed. The key synthetic step involved Br/Li exchange in respective potassium (bromoaryl)trifluoroborates followed by quenching with selected electrophiles (CO2, DMF, Me2Si(H)Cl) and hydrolytic workup. Two ring&#8208;expanded benzoxaborole congeners were obtained by an additional reduction step with LiAlH4 or NaBH4. The obtained boracyclic compounds were characterized in detail by NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Specifically, biphenyl&#8208;based systems show dynamic behaviour interpreted in terms of inversion of non&#8208;planar seven&#8208;membered boraheterocycles. The acidity of the obtained compounds varies very strongly (pKa ranges from 3.1&#8211;9.6) depending on their structure. Due to the enhanced boron Lewis acidity, selected compounds were used as a basis for luminescent complexes with 8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline. A strong phase&#8208;dependent variation of emission&#8208;band maximum (480&#8211;527&#8197;nm) and photoluminescence quantum yield (10&#8211;95&#8201;%) was observed, which was rationalized in terms of specific aggregation effects.

         <title>Peroxidase&#8208;Mimetic Copper&#8208;Doped Carbon&#8208;Dots for Oxidative Stress&#8208;Mediated Broad&#8208;Spectrum and Efficient Antibacterial Activity</title>

         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;sized, mono&#8208;dispersible, hydrophilic, and peroxidase&#8208;mimetic Cu&#8208;doped carbon dots (Cu&#8208;CDs) were prepared via one&#8208;pot hydrothermal carbonization. The harvested Cu&#8208;CDs permeated the cytomembrane and greatly promoted the catalytic oxidization of endogenous H2O2 into OH and glutathione (GSH) depletion by oxidizing GSH into glutathione disulfide (GS&#8208;SG), resulting in the occurrence of oxidative stress and finally, death of bacteria.







Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) have recently emerged as antibacterial agents and have attracted considerable attention owing to their fascinating merits of small size, facile fabrication, and surface functionalization. Most of them are involved in external light activation or hybridization with other functional nanomaterials. Herein, we present peroxidase&#8208;like Cu&#8208;doped CDs (Cu&#8208;CDs) for in vitro antibacterial applications. The unique peroxidase&#8208;mimicking property of the Cu&#8208;CDs was demonstrated by tetramethylbenzidine chromogenic assay, electron paramagnetic resonance spectra, and hydroxy radical probe. Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were chosen as representative gram&#8208;negative/positive models against which Cu&#8208;CDs exhibited superior antimicrobial activity even at a dosage down to 5&#8197;&#956;g/mL. A possible mechanism of action was that the Cu&#8208;CDs triggered a catalytic redox reaction of endogenous H2O2 and glutathione depletion in the bacteria cells, with subsequent oxidative stress and membrane disruption. This work provides a new strategy for the design of microenvironment&#8208;responsive antimicrobial nano&#8208;agents.

         <title>Elucidating the Germanium Distribution in ITQ&#8208;13 Zeolites by Density Functional Theory**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 14, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preferred Ge distributions in ITQ&#8208;13 silicogermanates with different Si/Ge ratios were investigated with electronic structure calculations, with the primary aim of predicting the most stable local structures across the range of Ge contents. Additional calculations were used to study the variation of the dynamic behaviour of the incorporated fluoride anions as a function of the local environment and the defluorination behaviour of different fluoride&#8208;containing cages.







Abstract
ITQ&#8208;13 is a medium&#8208;pore zeolite that can be prepared in all&#8208;silica form and as silicogermanate with Si/Ge ratios as low as 3. Usually synthesised in the presence of fluoride, ITQ&#8208;13 is among the very few systems containing fluoride anions in two distinct cage types, cube&#8208;like d4r units and [4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;56] cages. Here, dispersion&#8208;corrected density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to investigate the energetically most favourable Ge distributions for Si/Ge ratios between 55 and 6. The calculations show Ge atoms are incorporated at both the corners of d4r cages and at the basal plane of the [4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;56] cages, in accordance with 19F&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. Two Ge atoms at adjacent corners of [4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;56] cages are stable at the highest Ge content considered (Si/Ge=6). Such a local environment has not yet been considered in the experimental literature. A calculation of the corresponding 19F&#8197;NMR resonance points to overlap with other resonances, which might preclude its clear identification. Additional calculations investigate the variation of the dynamic behaviour of the fluoride anions as a function of the local environment as well as the selective defluorination of the [4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;56] cages.

         <title>Fibril Structure Demonstrates the Role of Iodine Labelling on a Pentapeptide Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 14, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iodination is an attractive yet minimal functionalization to engineer the self&#8208;assembly of amyloidogenic peptides. Despite having received little attention in the field, iodinated aliphatic residues can expand the library of functional moieties able to tune peptides self&#8208;assembly. In our work, a custom iodinated aliphatic amino acid was synthesized and introduced into a pentapeptide, enhancing its self&#8208;assembly and crystallogenic properties.







Abstract
Iodination has long been employed as a successful labelling strategy to gain structural insights into proteins and other biomolecules via several techniques, including Small Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering, Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP&#8208;MS), and single&#8208;crystal crystallography. However, when dealing with smaller biomolecular systems, interactions driven by iodine may significantly alter their self&#8208;assembly behaviour. The engineering of amyloidogenic peptides for the development of ordered nanomaterials has greatly benefitted from this possibility. Still, to date, iodination has exclusively been applied to aromatic residues. In this work, an aliphatic bis&#8208;iodinated amino acid was synthesized and included into a custom pentapeptide, which showed enhanced fibrillogenic behaviour. Peptide single crystal X&#8208;ray structure and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction on its dried water solution demonstrated the key role of iodine atoms in promoting intermolecular interactions that drive the peptide self&#8208;assembly into amyloid fibrils. These findings enlarge the library of halogenated moieties available for directing and engineering the self&#8208;assembly of amyloidogenic peptides.

         <title>Random Occupation of Multimetal Sites in Transition Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Boosting the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 14, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Less order, more action: Compared to single metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), the random occupation of multi&#8208;metal nodes in transitional MOFs builds a high&#8208;entropy state. Furthermore, this high&#8208;entropy&#8208;state MOFs caused a partial crystal distortion that can break up the catalytic atom&#8216;s saturated coordination environment to produce a highly active unsaturated state, optimizing the adsorption energies between oxygen intermediates and catalytic centres.







Abstract
Developing robust oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts with excellent performance is essential for the conversion of renewable electricity to clean fuel. Herein, we present a facile concept for the synthesis of efficient high&#8208;entropy metal&#8208;organic frameworks (HEMOFs) as electrocatalysts in a one&#8208;step solvothermal synthesis.

     alt="Random Occupation of Multimetal Sites in Transition Metal-Organic Frameworks for Boosting the Oxygen Evolution Reaction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Less order, more action&lt;/b&gt;: Compared to single metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), the random occupation of multi-metal nodes in transitional MOFs builds a high-entropy state. Furthermore, this high-entropy-state MOFs caused a partial crystal distortion that can break up the catalytic atom&#8216;s saturated coordination environment to produce a highly active unsaturated state, optimizing the adsorption energies between oxygen intermediates and catalytic centres.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing robust oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts with excellent performance is essential for the conversion of renewable electricity to clean fuel. Herein, we present a facile concept for the synthesis of efficient high-entropy metal-organic frameworks (HEMOFs) as electrocatalysts in a one-step solvothermal synthesis. This strategy allows control of the microstructure and corresponding lattice distortion by tuning the metal ion composition. As a result, the OER activity was improved by optimizing the coordination environment of the metal catalytic center. The optimized Co-rich HEMOFs exhibited a low overpotential of 310&#8197;mV at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, better than a RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst tested under the same conditions. The finding of lattice distortion of the HEMOFs provides a new strategy for developing high-performance electrocatalysts for energy conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Heterodinuclear Mg(II)M(II) (M=Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn) Complexes for the Ring Opening Copolymerization of Carbon Dioxide/Epoxide and Anhydride/Epoxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 14, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of new heterodinuclear complexes comprising Mg(II)M(II) are reported as highly efficient catalysts for both the ROCOP of CO2/cyclohexene oxide and norbornene anhydride/cyclohexene oxide. Mg(II)Co(II) and Mg(II)Fe(II) were the most effective combinations in the catalysis.







Abstract
The catalysed ring opening copolymerizations (ROCOP) of carbon dioxide/epoxide or anhydride/epoxide are controlled polymerizations that access useful polycarbonates and polyesters. Here, a systematic investigation of a series of heterodinuclear Mg(II)M(II) complexes reveals which metal combinations are most effective. The complexes combine different first row transition metals (M(II)) from Cr(II) to Zn(II), with Mg(II); all complexes are coordinated by the same macrocyclic ancillary ligand and by two acetate co&#8208;ligands. The complex syntheses and characterization data, as well as the polymerization data, for both carbon dioxide/cyclohexene oxide (CHO) and endo&#8208;norbornene anhydride (NA)/cyclohexene oxide, are reported. The fastest catalyst for both polymerizations is Mg(II)Co(II) which shows propagation rate constants (kp) of 34.7&#8197;mM&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 (CO2) and 75.3&#8197;mM&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 (NA) (100&#8201;&#176;C). The Mg(II)Fe(II) catalyst also shows excellent performances with equivalent rates for CO2/CHO ROCOP (kp=34.7&#8197;mM&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) and may be preferable in terms of metallic abundance, low cost and low toxicity. Polymerization kinetics analyses reveal that the two lead catalysts show overall second order rate laws, with zeroth order dependencies in CO2 or anhydride concentrations and first order dependencies in both catalyst and epoxide concentrations. Compared to the homodinuclear Mg(II)Mg(II) complex, nearly all the transition metal heterodinuclear complexes show synergic rate enhancements whilst maintaining high selectivity and polymerization control. These findings are relevant to the future design and optimization of copolymerization catalysts and should stimulate broader investigations of synergic heterodinuclear main group/transition metal catalysts.

A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free approach for the synthesis of symmetrical/unsymmetrical triarylmethanes and diarylmethanes is reported. This protocol features mild conditions, feedstock reagents, very low catalyst loading, remarkable scope (&gt;85 examples) and gram&#8208;scale synthesis (TON=475). Moreover, several unexplored biologically active molecules for example, the antiparkinson agent, vibrindole A, turbomycin B and, total synthesis of an anti&#8208;breast&#8208;cancer agent is demonstrated. Control experiments and mechanistic studies have also been carried out to detect the reaction intermediates and reaction progress to elucidate the possible reaction mechanism.







Abstract
This work describes a mild and robust double hydroarylation strategy for the synthesis of symmetrical /unsymmetrical diaryl&#8208; and triarylmethanes in excellent yields using Lambert salt (0.2&#8211;1.0&#8197;mol%). Despite the anticipated challenges associated with controlling selective product formation, unsymmetrical diaryl&#8208; and triarylmethanes products are obtained unprecedentedly. A highly efficient gram scale reaction has also been reported (TON for symmetrical product=475 and for unsymmetrical product=390). The synthetic utility of the methodology is demonstrated by the preparation of several unexplored diaryl&#8208; and triarylmethane&#8208;based biologically relevant molecules, such as arundine, vibrindole A, turbomycin B, and certain anti&#8208;inflammatory agents. A total synthesis of an anti&#8208;breast&#8208;cancer agent is also demonstrated. Control experiments, Hammett analysis, HRMS and GC&#8208;MS studies reveal the reaction intermediates and reaction mechanism.

         <title>The Spin Modulation Stimulated Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction over LaCoO3 Perovskite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 14, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spin modulation strategy is proposed to improve the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction activity for perovskite oxide LaCoO3 (LCO), which was realized by adjusting the high temperature thermal reduction time. The prepared catalyst with optimized high temperature thermal reduction time of 60&#8197;min (LCO&#8208;60) exhibits more appropriate eg orbital occupation and shows significantly enhanced electrocatalytic oxygen evolution activity under an external magnetic field.







Abstract
Perovskite is a promising non&#8208;noble catalyst and has been widely investigated for the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, there is still serious lack of valid approaches to further enhance their catalytic performance. Herein, we propose a spin state modulation strategy to improve the OER electrocatalytic activity of typical perovskite material of LaCoO3. Specifically, the electronic configuration transition was realized by a simple high temperature thermal reduction process. M&#8208;H hysteresis loop results reveal that the reduction treatment can produce more unpaired electrons in 3d orbit by promoting the electron transitions of Co from low spin state to high spin state, and thus lead to the increase of the spin polarization. Electrochemical measurements show that the catalytic performance of LaCoO3 is strongly dependent on its electronic configuration. With the optimized reduction treatment, the overpotential for the OER process in 0.5&#8197;M KOH electrolyte solution at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 current density was 396&#8197;mV, significantly lower than that of the original state. Furthermore, it can mediate efficient OER with an overpotential of 383&#8197;mV under an external magnetic field, which is attributed to the appropriate electron filling. Our results show that electron spin state regulation is a new way to boost the OER electrocatalytic activity.

         <title>On the Road Toward More Efficient Biocompatible Two&#8208;Photon Excitable Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 14, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;photon absorption is a widely use process for bioimaging, as it allows to go deeper in tissue than conventional absorption and also limit photodamages. Unfortunately, classical dyes possess poor two&#8208;photon cross&#8208;sections. In this work, we developed a series of quadrupolar dyes and showed that these biocompatible probes exhibit high two&#8208;photon cross&#8208;sections (up to 3650&#8197;GM) and are therefore good candidates for two&#8208;photon bioimaging.







Abstract
Red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR absorption and emission wavelengths are key requirements for intravital bioimaging. One of the way to reach such excitation wavelengths is to use two&#8208;photon excitation. Unfortunately, there is still a lack of two&#8208;photon excitable fluorophores that are both efficient and biocompatible. Thus, we design a series of biocompatible quadrupolar dyes in order to study their ability to be used for live&#8208;cell imaging, and in particular for two&#8208;photon microscopy. Hence, we report the synthesis of 5 probes based on different donor cores (phenoxazine, acridane, phenazasiline and phenothiazine) and the study of their linear and non&#8208;linear photophysical properties. TD&#8208;DFT calculations were performed and were able to highlight the structure&#8208;property relationship of this series. All these studies highlight the great potential of three of these biocompatible dyes for two&#8208;photon microscopy, as they both exhibit high two&#8208;photon cross&#8208;sections (up to 3650&#8197;GM) and emit orange to red light.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Two-photon absorption&lt;/b&gt; is a widely use process for bioimaging, as it allows to go deeper in tissue than conventional absorption and also limit photodamages. Unfortunately, classical dyes possess poor two-photon cross-sections. In this work, we developed a series of quadrupolar dyes and showed that these biocompatible probes exhibit high two-photon cross-sections (up to 3650&#8197;GM) and are therefore good candidates for two-photon bioimaging.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red-to-NIR absorption and emission wavelengths are key requirements for intravital bioimaging. One of the way to reach such excitation wavelengths is to use two-photon excitation. Unfortunately, there is still a lack of two-photon excitable fluorophores that are both efficient and biocompatible. Thus, we design a series of biocompatible quadrupolar dyes in order to study their ability to be used for live-cell imaging, and in particular for two-photon microscopy. Hence, we report the synthesis of 5 probes based on different donor cores (phenoxazine, acridane, phenazasiline and phenothiazine) and the study of their linear and non-linear photophysical properties. TD-DFT calculations were performed and were able to highlight the structure-property relationship of this series. All these studies highlight the great potential of three of these biocompatible dyes for two-photon microscopy, as they both exhibit high two-photon cross-sections (up to 3650&#8197;GM) and emit orange to red light. This potential was confirmed through live-cell two-photon microscopy experiments, leading to images with very high brightness and contrast.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In&#8208;situ Synthesis of the Thinnest In2Se3/In2S3/In2Se3 Sandwich&#8208;Like Heterojunction for Photoelectrocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 14, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sandwich&#8208;like In2Se3/In2S3/In2Se3 (SW In2S3@In2Se3) heterojunction was fabricated via the in&#8197;situ synthesis method for water splitting. The in&#8197;situ synthesis technology was used to realize the overall transformation of the exterior of ultra&#8208;thin two&#8208;dimensional nanosheets while ensuring that the nanosheet array is not damaged in this work. The sandwich&#8208;like structure constructed by this technology avoids the problems of heterojunction stacking. As a result, the SW In2S3@In2Se3 shows the best photoelectrochemical water splitting performance and excellent stability.







Abstract
The efficient utilization of solar energy for photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) water splitting is a feasible solution for developing clean energy and alleviating environmental issues. However, as the core of PEC technology, the existing photoanode catalysts have disadvantages such as poor photoelectrocatalytic conversion efficiency, low conductivity of photogenerated carriers, and instability. Here, we report the ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional sandwich&#8208;like (SW) heterojunction of In2Se3/In2S3/In2Se3 (SW In2S3@In2Se3) for the first time for PEC water splitting. Our findings identify the efficient separation of electrons and holes by constructing SW In2S3@In2Se3 heterojunction. The in&#8197;situ synthesis of ultrathin nanosheet arrays by using surface substitution of Se atom to epitaxially grow cell In2Se3 maximizes the contact area of heterogeneous interface and accelerates the transmission of charge carrier. Benefitting from the unique structure and composition characteristic, SW In2S3@In2Se3 displays excellent performance in PEC water splitting. The photocurrent density of SW In2S3@In2Se3 reaches 8.43&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;VRHE. Compared with In2S3, the SW In2S3@In2Se3 photoanode has nearly 12 times higher PEC performance, which represents the best performance among the In2S3&#8208;based photoanode heterojunction reported so far. The evolution rate of O2 reaches 78.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1, and the photocurrent has no apparent variety within 24&#8197;h.

Protein probes: Phenylglyoxal&#8208;linked dNTPs have been designed and synthesized by using two different approaches &#8211; CuAAC and Sonogashira reactions &#8211; that are compatible with the highly reactive glyoxal moiety. These nucleotides were shown to be good substrates for the enzymatic construction of DNA probes for crosslinking with Arg&#8208;containing peptides or proteins.







Abstract
Glyoxal&#8208;linked 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyuridine 5&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;mono&#8208; and triphosphates were synthesized through a CuAAC click reaction of 4&#8208;azidophenylglyoxal or a Sonogashira reaction of 4&#8208;bromophenylglyoxal with 5&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;dUMP or &#8208;dUTP. The triphosphates were used as substrates for enzymatic synthesis of modified DNA probes with KOD XL DNA polymerase. The glyoxal&#8208;linked nucleotides reacted with arginine&#8208;containing peptides to form stable imizadolone&#8208;linked conjugates. This reactive glyoxal modification in DNA was used for efficient bioconjugations and crosslinking with Arg&#8208;containing peptides or proteins (e.&#8201;g., histones) and was found to be more reactive than previously reported 1,3&#8208;diketone&#8208;linked DNA probes.

         <title>Thermodynamically Favourable States in the Reaction of Nitrogenase without Dissociation of any Sulfide Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 14, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction mechanism of nitrogenase from N2H2 to 2&#8201;NH3 without any dissociated sulfide ligands has been studied by QM/MM methods. The calculations suggest an alternating mechanism in which the substrate binds to Fe6. Homocitrate functions as a proton buffer, stabilising H2NNH2 and NH3 intermediates. The two NH3 products dissociate at the E7 and E8 levels. His&#8208;195 prefers protonation on the NE2 atom and proton transfer from this residue is favourable for all steps.







Abstract
We have used combined quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations to study the reaction mechanism of nitrogenase, assuming that none of the sulfide ligands dissociates. To avoid the problem that there is no consensus regarding the structure and protonation of the E4 state, we start from a state where N2 is bound to the cluster and is protonated to N2H2, after dissociation of H2. We show that the reaction follows an alternating mechanism with HNNH (possibly protonated to HNNH2) and H2NNH2 as intermediates and the two NH3 products dissociate at the E7 and E8 levels. For all intermediates, coordination to Fe6 is preferred, but for the E4 and E8 intermediates, binding to Fe2 is competitive. For the E4, E5 and E7 intermediates we find that the substrate may abstract a proton from the hydroxy group of the homocitrate ligand of the FeMo cluster, thereby forming HNNH2, H2NNH2 and NH3 intermediates. This may explain why homocitrate is a mandatory component of nitrogenase. All steps in the suggested reaction mechanism are thermodynamically favourable compared to protonation of the nearby His&#8208;195 group and in all cases, protonation of the NE2 atom of the latter group is preferred.

         <title>Capture of Gaseous Iodine in Isoreticular Zirconium&#8208;Based UiO&#8208;n Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Influence of Amino Functionalization, DFT Calculations, Raman and EPR Spectroscopic Investigation</title>

Conversion of I2 into I3&#8722; species trapped within UiO&#8208;n. The adsorption of gaseous iodine in UiO&#8208;n MOF&#8208;like materials has been systematically studied by analyzing kinetic curves. They show the conversion of trapped I2 into anionic species I3&#8722;, which is enhanced by the existence of amino groups functionalizing the organic linkers.







Abstract
A series of Zr&#8208;based UiO&#8208;n MOF materials (n=66, 67, 68) have been studied for iodine capture. Gaseous iodine adsorption was collected kinetically from a home&#8208;made set&#8208;up allowing the continuous measurement of iodine content trapped within UiO&#8208;n compounds, with organic functionalities (&#8722;H, &#8722;CH3, &#8722;Cl, &#8722;Br, &#8722;(OH)2, &#8722;NO2, &#8722;NH2, (&#8722;NH2)2, &#8722;CH2 NH2) by in&#8208;situ UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy. This study emphasizes the role of the amino groups attached to the aromatic rings of the ligands connecting the {Zr6O4(OH)4} brick. In particular, the preferential interaction of iodine with lone&#8208;pair groups, such as amino functions, has been experimentally observed and is also based on DFT calculations. Indeed, higher iodine contents were systematically measured for amino&#8208;functionalized UiO&#8208;66 or UiO&#8208;67, compared to the pristine material (up to 1211&#8197;mg/g for UiO&#8208;67&#8208;(NH2)2). However, DFT calculations revealed the highest computed interaction energies for alkylamine groups (&#8722;CH2NH2) in UiO&#8208;67 (&#8722;128.5&#8197;kJ/mol for the octahedral cavity), and pointed out the influence of this specific functionality compared with that of an aromatic amine. The encapsulation of iodine within the pore system of UiO&#8208;n materials and their amino&#8208;derivatives has been analyzed by UV&#8208;Vis and Raman spectroscopy. We showed that a systematic conversion of molecular iodine (I2) species into anionic I&#8722; ones, stabilized as I&#8722;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I2 or I3&#8722; complexes within the MOF cavities, occurs when I2@UiO&#8208;n samples are left in ambient light.

         <title>Tuning the C/N Ratio of C&#8208;Rich Graphitic Carbon Nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) Materials by the Melamine/Carboxylic Acid Adduct Route</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 14, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile synthesis route to graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4)&#8208;type materials CNx having a large range of composition (0.66&lt;x&lt;1.4) is presented. The process is based on the decomposition of melamine/carboxylic acid adducts and yields peculiar 2D nanostructures with presumably C&#8208;rich nanodomains embedded in g&#8208;C3N4 domains. The characteristics of these nanocomposites are investigated by different techniques (X&#8208;ray diffraction, thermal analysis, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and many others).







Abstract
C&#8208;rich graphitic carbonitride materials (CNx) with a large range of compositions have been prepared thanks to the self&#8208;assembly, in different ratios, of melamine (M) and a panel of polycarboxylic acids (A) such as oxalic, tartaric and citric acid. The thermal conversion of the formed adducts (MAy), led to CNx phases, with x ranging from 0.66 to 1.4 (x=1.33 for g&#8208;C3N4 for comparison). The properties of these materials were examined by different techniques (XRD, Raman spectroscopy, TEM, TGA, XPS and DRIFT). It appears that the increase in the C content is associated with the disappearance of the long&#8208;range order of heptazine units and an increase in the sub&#8208;nanometer carbon&#8208;rich cluster size within the graphitic g&#8208;C3N4 structure. This trend is followed by a significant increase in the interlayer spacing and a lower proportion of N=C&#8722;N bonds compared to C=C bonds. The thermal stability under an inert atmosphere of these phases and their UV&#8208;Visible absorbance properties were also investigated.

         <title>H/F Substitution Induced Large Increase of Tc in a 3D Hybrid Rare&#8208;Earth Double Perovskite Multifunctional Compound</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 14, March 7, 2022. </description>

Multifunctional perovskites: Two 3D hybrid rare&#8208;earth double perovskite compounds show multiple stimuli&#8208;responsive properties that ferroelasticity, dielectric switch, and photoluminescence. The photoluminescence response shows that the emission intensity has no quench as the temperature increased. In particular, using the H/F substitution strategy generating an Rb&#8208;F coordinate bond enhanced the interactions between the cations and the anions to realize high Tc ferroelasticity.







Abstract
Increasing attention has been devoted to studying perovskite&#8208;type multifunctional stimuli&#8208;responsive materials with multiple channel physical characteristics. However, it remains challenging to simultaneously achieve multifunction and regulate structural phase transition temperature in hybrid perovskites. Here, we report two three&#8208;dimensional organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid rare&#8208;earth double perovskite compounds, (HQ)2RbEu(NO3)6 (1, HQ=quinuclidium) and (4FHQ)2RbEu(NO3)6 (2, 4FHQ=4&#8208;fluoro&#8208;quinuclidium), which exhibit ferroelasticity, dielectric switch, and excellent photoluminescence response. The phase transition temperature of 2 increases 169&#8197;K compared with 1 through H/F substitution. This result is attributed to the H/F substitution inducing the generation of the Rb&#8208;F coordination bond between cations and anions. Meanwhile, the photoluminescence emission intensity of 2 shows no quench with the increase of temperature, in particular, the emission spectrum achieves fine regulation at high temperatures. This work provides a new solution for the realization of multi&#8208;functions and regulations of the properties based on hybrid perovskite materials with high critical temperatures.

         <title>Synthesis, Reactivity and Structural Properties of Trifluoromethylphosphoranides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 14, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different trifluoromethylated phosphoranides are accessible upon treatment of trifluoromethylated phosphanes, such as P(CF3)3, with a source of F&#8722; or CF3&#8722; in presence of a stabilizing counterion. The hypervalent compounds have been investigated by NMR spectroscopic as well as X&#8208;ray crystallographic methods, gaining insights into their stability and structural behavior. In addition, the phosphoranides have revealed fluorinating and trifluoromethylating properties towards electrophiles.







Abstract
Phosphoranides are interesting hypervalent species which serve as model compounds for intermediates or transition states in nucleophilic substitution reactions at trivalent phosphorus substrates. Herein, the syntheses and properties of stable trifluoromethylphosphoranide salts are reported. [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][P(CF3)4], [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][P(CF3)3F], and [NMe4][P(CF3)2F2] were obtained by treatment of trivalent precursors with sources of CF3&#8722; or F&#8722; units. These [P(CF3)4&#8208;nFn]&#8722; (n=0&#8211;2) salts exhibit fluorinating (n=1&#8211;2) or trifluoromethylating (n=0) properties, which is disclosed by studying their reactivity towards selected electrophiles. The solid&#8208;state structures of [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][P(CF3)4] and [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][P(CF3)3F] are ascertained by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The dynamics of these compounds are investigated by variable temperature NMR spectroscopy.

&lt;p&gt;Phosphoranides are interesting hypervalent species which serve as model compounds for intermediates or transition states in nucleophilic substitution reactions at trivalent phosphorus substrates. Herein, the syntheses and properties of stable trifluoromethylphosphoranide salts are reported. [K(18-crown-6)][P(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;], [K(18-crown-6)][P(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F], and [NMe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;][P(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] were obtained by treatment of trivalent precursors with sources of CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; or F&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; units. These [P(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4-n&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (n=0&#8211;2) salts exhibit fluorinating (n=1&#8211;2) or trifluoromethylating (n=0) properties, which is disclosed by studying their reactivity towards selected electrophiles. The solid-state structures of [K(18-crown-6)][P(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] and [K(18-crown-6)][P(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F] are ascertained by single crystal X-ray crystallography. The dynamics of these compounds are investigated by variable temperature NMR spectroscopy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Two A2BIBIII(NO3)6&#8208;type hybrid rare&#8208;earth double perovskites, (HQ)2RbEu(NO3)6 (HQ=quinuclidium) and (4FHQ)2RbEu(NO3)6 (4FHQ=4&#8208;fluoro&#8208;quinuclidium), exhibit excellent high&#8208;temperature ferroelasticity, dielectric switch, and high&#8208;efficiency photoluminescence response. The properties of the latter have been changed compared with the former through H/F substitution. The results reveal that H/F substitution provides an effective method for achieving novel properties, and more hybrid perovskites can be prepared. More information can be found in the Research Article by L.&#8208;P.&#8197;Miao, C.&#8197;Shi, Y.&#8197;Zhang et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103913).

Gaseous iodine has been captured by using a series of zirconium&#8208;based UiO&#8208;n metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) sorbents. This study highlights the significant role of amino groups attached to the organic linker, which enhance the iodine uptake capacity, as well as its conversion into anionic iodide I3&#8722; species, trapped within UiO&#8208;n cavities. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Loiseau et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104437). Margot Friscourt and Orfeas Plastiras are thanked for the cover artwork.

Methods for thioglycoside activation that rely on transition metal catalysis are summarized in this review.







Abstract
Thioglycosides are among the most common glycosyl donors that find broad application in the synthesis of glycans and glycoconjugates. However, the requirement for toxic and/or large access of activators needed for common glycosylations with thioglycosides remains a notable drawback. Due to the increased awareness of the chemical waste impact on the environment, synthetic studies have been driven by the goal of finding non&#8208;toxic reagents. The main focus of this review is to highlight recent methods for thioglycoside activation that rely on transition metal catalysis.

         <title>Sigma/pi Bonding Preferences of Solvated Alkali&#8208;Metal Cations to Ditopic Arylmethyl Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selection of diarylmethanes have been deprotonated at the bridgehead by alkali&#8208;metal bases and then trapped as monomers with polydentate N&#8208;donors to probe the different sigma/pi preferences of the resulting potentially ditopic anions towards the Li, Na or K cations. X&#8208;ray crystallography, multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations have been employed to interrogate the nature of these interactions across all three phases.







Abstract
Arylmethyl anions allow alkali&#8208;metals to bind in a &#963;&#8208;fashion to the lateral carbanionic centre or a &#960;&#8208;fashion to the aryl ring or in between these extremities, with the trend towards &#960; bonding increasing on descending group 1. Here we review known alkali metal structures of diphenylmethane, fluorene, 2&#8208;benzylpyridine and 4&#8208;benzylpyridine. Next, we synthesise Li, Na, K monomers of these diarylmethyls using polydentate donors PMDETA or Me6TREN to remove competing oligomerizing interactions, studying the effect that two aromatic rings has on negative charge (de)localisation via NMR, X&#8208;ray crystallographic and DFT studies. Diphenylmethyl and fluorenyl anions maintain C(H)&#8722;M interactions regardless of alkali&#8208;metal, although the adjacent arene carbons engage in interactions with larger alkali&#8208;metals. Introducing a nitrogen atom into the ring (at the 2&#8208; or 4&#8208;position) encourages relocalisation of negative charge away from the deprotonated carbon and onto nitrogen. Phenyl(2&#8208;pyridyl)methyl moves from an enamide formation at one extremity (lithium) to an aza&#8208;allyl formation at the other extremity (potassium), while C&#8208; or N&#8208;coordination modes become energetically viable for Na and K phenyl(4&#8208;pyridyl)methyl complexes.

         <title>Deciphering Internal and External &#960;&#8208;Conjugation in C3&#8208;Symmetric Multiple Azobenzene Connected Systems in Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two tripodal C3&#8208;symmetric photoswitchable molecular systems are reported that have extended conjugation at external and internal positions. The influence of the extended &#960;&#8208;bonds in their absorption properties, thermal relaxation of the photoisomers and their propensities in forming supramolecular self&#8208;assemblies have been explored through spectroscopy, and microscopic studies. Remarkably, the position of the acryl group influences the supramolecular assembly, and also in the formation of photoresponsive organic hydrogels or microcrystals.







Abstract
Two tripodal C3&#8208;symmetric photoswitchable molecular systems T1 and T2 are reported that have extended conjugation at external and internal positions using an acryl group. The influence of the extended &#960;&#8208;bonds in their absorption properties, thermal relaxation of the photoisomers and their propensities in forming supramolecular self&#8208;assemblies have been explored through spectroscopy, and microscopic studies. In particular, the investigations on the self&#8208;assembly have been carried out using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), polarized optical microscopy (POM), X&#8208;ray diffraction studies (XRD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Remarkably, the position of the acryl group influences the behaviour of the two target molecules in supramolecular assembly, and also in the formation of photoresponsive organic hydrogels or microcrystals.

Rapid, ultrasensitive, extraction&#8208;free and amplification&#8208;free strategy for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome&#8208;coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) RNA using a microfluidic biochip that exhibits an ultralow detection limit (600&#8197;copies&#8201;mL&#8722;1) and the ability to simultaneously evaluate 15&#8197;RNA samples within 40&#8197;min. The proposed RNA detection strategy has prospective applications in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 detection and COVID&#8208;19 (Corona virus disease 2019) patient diagnosis.







Abstract
The ongoing outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome&#8208;coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) has spread globally and poses a threat to public health and National economic development. Rapid and high&#8208;throughput SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA detection without the need of RNA extraction and amplification remain a key challenge. In this study, a new SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA detection strategy using a microfluidic biochip for the rapid and ultrasensitive detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 without RNA extraction and amplification was developed. This new strategy takes advantage of the specific SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA and probe DNA reaction in the microfluidic channel, fluorescence signal regulation by nanomaterials, and accurate sample control by the microfluidic chip. It presents an ultralow limit of detection of 600 copies&#8201;mL&#8722;1 in a large linear detection regime from 1 aM to 100&#8197;fM. Fifteen samples were simultaneously detected in 40&#8197;min without the need for RNA purification and amplification. The detection accuracy of the strategy was validated through quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT&#8208;PCR), with a recovery of 99&#8211;113&#8201;%. Therefore, the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA detection strategy proposed in this study can potentially be used for the quantitative diagnosis of viral infectious diseases.

         <title>A Combined Spectroscopic and Theoretical Study on a Ruthenium Complex Featuring a &#960;&#8208;Extended dppz Ligand for Light&#8208;Driven Accumulation of Multiple Reducing Equivalents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photophysical properties of a charge&#8208;photoaccumulating ruthenium complex are deciphered by mean of excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent resonance Raman, steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved absorption and emission spectroscopies, in combination with time&#8208;dependent density functional theory. This study sheds light on the decisive role played by the pyridoquinolinone subunit of the &#960;&#8208;extended dppz ligand in the photoinduced processes.







Abstract
The design of photoactive systems capable of storing and relaying multiple electrons is highly demanded in the field of artificial photosynthesis, where transformations of interest rely on multielectronic redox processes. The photophysical properties of the ruthenium photosensitizer [(bpy)2Ru(oxim&#8208;dppqp)]2+ (Ru), storing two electrons coupled to two protons on the &#960;&#8208;extended oxim&#8208;dppqp ligand under light&#8208;driven conditions, are investigated by means of excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent resonance Raman and transient absorption spectroscopies, in combination with time&#8208;dependent density functional theory; the results are discussed in comparison to the parent [(bpy)2Ru(dppz)]2+ and [(bpy)2Ru(oxo&#8208;dppqp)]2+ complexes. In addition, this study provides in&#8208;depth insights on the impact of protonation or of accumulation of multiple reducing equivalents on the reactive excited states.

The photophysical properties of the ruthenium photosensitizer [(bpy)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ru(&lt;b&gt;oxim-dppqp&lt;/b&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;Ru&lt;/b&gt;), storing two electrons coupled to two protons on the &#960;-extended &lt;b&gt;oxim-dppqp&lt;/b&gt; ligand under light-driven conditions, are investigated by means of excitation wavelength-dependent resonance Raman and transient absorption spectroscopies, in combination with time-dependent density functional theory; the results are discussed in comparison to the parent [(bpy)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ru(dppz)]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and [(bpy)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ru(&lt;b&gt;oxo-dppqp&lt;/b&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; complexes. In addition, this study provides in-depth insights on the impact of protonation or of accumulation of multiple reducing equivalents on the reactive excited states.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The varied Frustrated Lewis Pair Reactivity of the Germylene Phosphaketene (CH{(CMe)(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3N)}2)GePCO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The germylene species (CH{(CMe)(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3N)}2)GePCO 1 is shown to react with the Lewis acids (E(C6F5)3 E = B, Al). Nonetheless, 1 participates in FLP chemistry with electron deficient alkynes or olefins, acting as an intramolecular FLP. In contrast, in the presence of B(C6F5)3 and an electron rich alkyne, 1 behaves as Ge&#8208;based nucleophile to effect intermolecular FLP addition to the alkyne. This reactivity demonstrates that the reaction pathway is controlled by the nature of the electrophile and nucleophile generated in solution, as revealed by extensive DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Dissipative Dynamic Covalent Chemistry (DDCvC) Based on the Transimination Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report that the composition of a dynamic library (DL) of interconverting imines can be controlled over the time in a dissipative fashion by the addition of an activated carboxylic acid used as a chemical fuel. When the fuel is added to the DL, which is initially under thermodynamic equilibrium, the composition of the mixture dramatically changes and a new, dissipative (out of equilibrium) state is reached that persists until fuel exhaustion. Thus, a transient dissipative dynamic library (DDL) is generated that, eventually, reverts back to the initial DL when the fuel is consumed, closing a DL&#8594;DDL&#8594;DL cycle. The larger the amount of added fuel, the longer the time spent by the system in the DDL state. The transimination reaction is shown to be an optimal candidate for the realization of a dissipative dynamic covalent chemistry (DDCvC).</dc:description>

         <title>Coordination and Hydroboration of Ru(II)&#8208;Borate Complexes: Dihydridoborate vs. Bis(dihydridoborate)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New 18&#8208;electron pseudo&#8208;octahedral Ru&#8208;dihydridoborate and bis(dihydridoborate) complexes have been synthesized and structurally characterised. Isolation of Ru&#8208;bis(dihydridoborate) complexes permitted hydroboration reactions with [HC&#8801;C(CO2Me)] that unusually led to the formation of &#951;4&#8208;&#963;,&#960;&#8208;alkene&#8208;borane complexes via both Markovnikov and anti&#8208;Markovnikov additions.







Abstract
Treatment of [Cp*RuCl2]2, 1, [(COD)IrCl]2, 2 or [(p&#8208;cymene)RuCl2]2, 3 (Cp*=&#951;5&#8208;C5Me5, COD= 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene and p&#8208;cymene=&#951;6&#8208;iPrC6H4Me) with heterocyclic borate ligands [Na[(H3B)L], L1 and L2 (L1: L=amt, L2: L=mp; amt=2&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1,3,4&#8208;thiadiazole, mp=2&#8208;mercaptopyridine) led to the formation of borate complexes having uncommon coordination. For example, complexes 1 and 2 on reaction with L1 and L2 afforded dihydridoborate species [LAM(&#956;&#8208;H)2BHL] 4&#8211;6 (4: LA=Cp*, M=Ru, L=amt; 5: LA=Cp*, M=Ru, L=mp; 6: LA=COD, M=Ir, L=mp). On the other hand, treatment of 3 with L2 yielded cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;bis(dihydridoborate) species, [Ru{(&#956;&#8208;H)2BH(mp)}2], cis&#8208;7 and trans&#8208;7. The isolation and structural characterization of fac&#8208; and mer&#8208;[Ru{(&#956;&#8208;H)2BH(mp)}{(&#956;&#8208;H)BH(mp)2}], 8 from the same reaction offered an insight into the behaviour of these dihydridoborate species in solution. Fascinatingly, despite having reduced natural charges on Ru centres both at cis&#8208;and trans&#8208;7, they underwent hydroboration reaction with alkynes that yielded both Markovnikov and anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition products, 10&#8201;a&#8211;d.

         <title>Controlling the Dual&#8208;Emission Character of Aryl&#8208;Modified o&#8208;Carboranes by Intramolecular CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O Interaction Sites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual&#8208;emission character of aryl&#8208;modified o&#8208;carboranes can be regulated by intramolecular CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interactions. Stronger interactions can afford a higher LE/ICT (LE: locally excited, ICT: intramolecular charge transfer) ratio because of the tightly locked molecular orientation favorable for LE emission. Well&#8208;balanced LE/ICT dual emission could be achieved by tuning intramolecular interaction sites in the solid state. The more activated molecular motions at higher temperature gradually perturbed LE/ICT ratio, resulting in the thermoresponsivity in solid.







Abstract
It is still challenging to realize a dual&#8208;emission system, in which two luminescent bands simultaneously appear by photoexcitation, in solid with organic dyes due to the difficulty in regulation of electronic properties in the excited state and concentration quenching. o&#8208;Carborane is known to be a versatile platform for constructing solid&#8208;state emitters since the sphere boron cluster is favorable for suppressing intermolecular interactions and subsequently concentration quenching. Here, we show solid&#8208;state dual&#8208;emissive o&#8208;carborane derivatives. We prepared 4 types of o&#8208;carborane derivatives and found dual&#8208;emission behaviors both in solution and solid states. By regulating the rotation at the o&#8208;carborane unit with the intramolecular CcageH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interaction, the dual&#8208;emission intensity ratios were changed. Finally, it was demonstrated that the overall photoluminescence spectra can be estimated using the binding energy of intramolecular interactions.

         <title>Versatile Near&#8208;Infrared Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging of Amyloid Fibrils with the Fluorogenic Probe CRANAD&#8208;2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We test the performance of CRANAD&#8208;2 in stimulated emission depletion (STED) and single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM), two super&#8208;resolution techniques with typically divergent fluorophore requirements. By conveniently adapting the concentration of CRANAD&#8208;2, which transiently binds to amyloid fibrils, we show that it performs well in both techniques, achieving a resolution in the range of 45&#8211;55&#8197;nm.







Abstract
CRANAD&#8208;2 is a fluorogenic curcumin derivative used for near&#8208;infrared detection and imaging in vivo of amyloid aggregates, which are involved in neurodegenerative diseases. We explore the performance of CRANAD&#8208;2 in two super&#8208;resolution imaging techniques, namely stimulated emission depletion (STED) and single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM), with markedly different fluorophore requirements. By conveniently adapting the concentration of CRANAD&#8208;2, which transiently binds to amyloid fibrils, we show that it performs well in both techniques, achieving a resolution in the range of 45&#8211;55&#8197;nm. Correlation of SMLM with atomic force microscopy (AFM) validates the resolution of fine features in the reconstructed super&#8208;resolved image. The good performance and versatility of CRANAD&#8208;2 provides a powerful tool for near&#8208;infrared nanoscopic imaging of amyloids in vitro and in vivo.

         <title>In Vitro Anticancer Ability of Nano Fluorescent 111In&#8208;MIL&#8208;68/PEG&#8208;FA on Hela Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of nano fluorescent 111In&#8208;MOF with built&#8208;in Auger electron emitter (111In) is elaborately designed. The in&#8197;vitro evaluations demonstrate that the obtained radioactive nanomedicine can specifically target Hela cells, and effectively inhibit the growth of cancer cells. Furthermore, the cell cycle distribution showed a dose&#8208;dependent G2/M arrest mode, also indicating that the obtained 111In&#8208;MOF is able to promote the cells to enter apoptotic program.







Abstract
In past decades, nanoscale metal&#8208;organic frameworks (NMOFs) have drawn more and more attention in multimodal imaging and targeting therapy of various malignant cancers. Here, we proposed to dope 111In into fluorescent In&#8208;based NMOFs (In&#8208;MIL&#8208;68&#8208;NH2), with an attempt to prepare a new nanomedicine with great anticancer potential. As a proof of concept, the obtained NMOF (In&#8208;MIL&#8208;68/PEG&#8208;FA) with targeting motifs is able to act as a fluorescent probe to achieve Hela cell imaging. Moreover, the Auger electron emitter 111In built in corresponding radioactive NMOF (111In&#8208;MIL&#8208;68/PEG&#8208;FA) can bring clear damage to cancer cells, leading to a high cell killing rate of 59.3&#8201;% within 48&#8197;h. In addition, the cell cycle presented a significant dose&#8208;dependent G2/M inhibiting mode, which indicates that 111In&#8208;MIL&#8208;68/PEG&#8208;FA has the ability to facilitate the cancer cells to enter apoptotic program. This work demonstrated the potential of 111In&#8208;labelled NMOFs in specific killings of cancer cells, providing a new approach to develop nanomedicines with theranostic function.

         <title>Nitrogen Donor Protection for Atomically Precise Metal Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beyond the conventional thiolate, phosphine and alkynyl ligands, nitrogen donor ligands have recently emerged as protecting agents for well&#8208;defined metal nanoclusters. Given the terminal coordination preference of the negatively charged amido and amidinate ligands with multidentate donors, interesting structural and functional features are observed for metal nanoclusters protected by these types of N donor ligands.







Abstract
Surface organic ligands are critical in dictating the structures and properties of atomically precise metal nanoclusters. In contrast to the conventionally used thiolate, phosphine and alkynyl ligands, nitrogen donor ligands have not been used in the protection for well&#8208;defined metal nanoclusters until recently. This review focuses on recent developments in atomically precise metal nanoclusters stabilized by different types of nitrogen donor ligands, in which the synthesis, total structure determination and various properties are covered. We hope that this review will provide insights into the rational design of N donor&#8208;protected metal nanoclusters in terms of structural and functional modulation.

         <dc:description>
Photochemistry: Since 2014, we have introduced in literature the use of phenylglyoxylic acid (PhCOCOOH), a small and commercially available organic molecule, as a potent promoter in a variety of photochemical processes. Although PhCOCOOH has a broad scope of photochemical reactions that can promote, the understanding of its mode of action in our early contributions was moderate. Herein, a thorough study led to a unified and revisited reaction mechanism for the PhCOCOOH&#8208;mediated reactions. A comparison to known photoinitiators was also performed.

         <title>Explorations of New SHG Materials in Mercury Iodate Sulfate System**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Winning combo: By combining Hg2+ with strong polarizability, iodate with asymmetric configuration, and sulfate with large band gap, Hg2(IO3)2(SO4)(H2O) with a strong second&#8208;harmonic generation signal and short ultraviolet absorption edge was obtained. It crystallizes in the polar space group C2 and features 3D framework composed of [Hg(IO3)]+ cationic layers and SO42&#8722; anions through Hg&#8722;O&#8722;S linkages. The transformation between Hg2(IO3)2(SO4)(H2O) and Hg2(IO3)2(SO4) is also very interesting. (In the graphic, KDP=KH2PO4)







Abstract
Through systematic experiments, two novel mercury iodate sulfates, namely, Hg2(IO3)2(SO4)(H2O) and Hg2(IO3)2(SO4) were obtained. They crystallize in monoclinic space group C2 and C2/c, respectively. Hg2(IO3)2(SO4)(H2O) exhibits the [Hg(IO3)]+ polar cationic layer inherited from Hg(IO3)2 and the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) framework inherited from HgSO4. This enables Hg2(IO3)2(SO4)(H2O) to generate a strong second harmonic generation (SHG) response of 6 times that of KH2PO4 (KDP). The structure of Hg2(IO3)2(SO4) is very similar to that of Hg2(IO3)2(SO4)(H2O), and they can be transformed into each other. Hg2(IO3)2(SO4)(H2O) shows a large optical band gap of 3.98&#8197;eV and a high dehydration temperature of 250&#8201;&#176;C. This study indicates that by reasonable design, the introduction of multiple functional groups into a compound may combine their advantages to achieve good overall optical performance.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through systematic experiments, two novel mercury iodate sulfates, namely, Hg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) and Hg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) were obtained. They crystallize in monoclinic space group &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;2 and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;2/&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;, respectively. Hg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) exhibits the [Hg(IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; polar cationic layer inherited from Hg(IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the three-dimensional (3D) framework inherited from HgSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. This enables Hg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) to generate a strong second harmonic generation (SHG) response of 6 times that of KH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (KDP). The structure of Hg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is very similar to that of Hg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), and they can be transformed into each other. Hg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) shows a large optical band gap of 3.98&#8197;eV and a high dehydration temperature of 250&#8201;&#176;C. This study indicates that by reasonable design, the introduction of multiple functional groups into a compound may combine their advantages to achieve good overall optical performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Formation and photoinduced electron transfer in porphyrin&#8208; and phthalocyanine&#8208; bearing N&#8208;doped graphene hybrids synthesized via click chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Graphene doped with heteroatoms such as nitrogen, boron, and phosphorous by replacing some of the skeletal carbon atoms is emerging as an important class of two&#8208;dimensional materials as it offers the much&#8208;needed bandgap for optoelectronic applications and provides better access for chemical functionalization at the hetero&#8208;atom sites. Covalent grafting of photosensitizers onto such doped graphenes makes them highly useful for light&#8208;induced applications.&#160; Herein, we report the covalent functionalization of N&#8208;doped graphene (NG) with two well&#8208;known electron donor photosensitizers, namely, zinc porphyrin (ZnP) and zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc), using the simple  click  chemistry approach.  Covalent attachment of ZnP and ZnPc at the N&#8208;sites of NG in NG&#8208;ZnP and NG&#8208;ZnPc hybrids was confirmed using a range of spectroscopic, thermogravimetric, and imaging techniques.  Ground and excited&#8208;state interactions in  NG&#8208;ZnP and NG&#8208;ZnPc were  monitored using spectral and electrochemical techniques. Efficient quenching of photosensitizer fluorescence in these hybrids was observed, and the relatively easier oxidations of ZnP and ZnPc supported excited&#8208;state charge&#8208;separation events. Photoinduced charge separation in NG&#8208;ZnP and NG&#8208;ZnPc hybrids was confirmed using the ultrafast pump&#8208;probe technique. The measured rate constants were of the order of 10  10  s,  &#8208;1  thus indicating ultrafast electron transfer phenomena.</dc:description>

         <title>Large Enhancement of Single Molecular Conductance of Molecular Wire by a Radical Substituent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A comparison of single molecular conductance between two &#960;&#8208;conjugated wires with and without radical substituent was performed. Specifically, methyl&#8208; and iminonitroxide&#8208;substituted 4&#8208;(biphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;yl)pyridine wires bound onto porphyrin template were subjected to scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) apparent height measurement at the interface between highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) and 1&#8208;octanoic acid. Statistical analysis of STM images revealed that the radical&#8208;substituted wire has 3.2&#177;1.7 times larger conductance than the methyl&#8208;substituted reference. Although density functional theory (DFT) calculation suggests that only 17% of the SOMO is distributed on the wire moiety, the effect was significant. This study presents the potential of radical substituents to achieve the high conductivity of molecular wires.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetics&#8208;Based Approach to Developing Electrocatalytic Variants of Slow Oxidations: Application to Hydride Abstraction&#8208;Initiated Cyclization Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical oxidant regeneration is challenging in reactions that have a slow redox step because the steady state concentration of the reduced oxidant is low, causing difficulties in maintaining sufficient current or preventing potential spikes. This manuscript shows that applying an understanding of the relationship between intermediate cation stability, oxidant strength, overpotential, and concentration on reaction kinetics delivers a method for electrochemical oxoammonium ion regeneration in hydride abstraction&#8208;initiated cyclization reactions, resulting in the development of an electrocatalytic variant of a process that has a high oxidation transition state free energy. This approach should be applicable to expanding the scope of electrocatalysis to include additional slow redox processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescent Thin Films Enabled by CsPbX3 (X=Cl, Br, I) Precursor Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inorganic cesium lead halide perovskite nanocrystals are candidates for lighting and display materials due to their outstanding optoelectronic properties. However, the dissolution issue of perovskite nanocrystals in polar solvents remains a challenge for practical applications. Herein, we present a newly&#8208;designed one&#8208;step spin&#8208;coating strategy to prepare a novel multicolor&#8208;tunable CsPbX3  (X=Cl, Br, I) nanocrystal film, where the CsPbX3  precursor solution was formed by dissolving PbO, Cs2CO3,  and CH3NH3X into the ionic liquid n&#8208;butylammonium butyrate. The as&#8208;designed CsPbX3  nanocrystal films show high color purity with a narrow emission width. Also, the blue CsPb(Cl/Br)3  film demonstrates the absolute photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) of 15.6%, which is higher than 11.7% of green CsPbBr3  and 8.3% of red CsPb(Br/I)3  film. This study develops an effective approach to preparing CsPbX3  nanocrystal thin films, opening a new avenue to design perovskite nanocrystals&#8208;based devices for lighting and display applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Single crystals of mixed&#8208;cation copper&#8208;based perovskite with trimodal bandgap behavior</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional hybrid perovskites, with their novel functionalities and structural diversity, are a perfect platform for emerging optoelectronic devices such as photodetectors, lightemitting diodes, and solar cells. For the first time, we studied the synthesis and characterization of mixed&#8208;cation copper perovskite crystals including (Cs, caesium/MA, methyl ammonium). Interestingly, unlike mixed&#8208;cation lead perovskites, which demonstrate bimodal band gap behavior, mixed&#8208;cation copper perovskites demonstrate trimodal band gap behavior, as proven by X&#8208;Ray Diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. In comparison to all Cs perovskite, which has antiferromagnetic properties, all MA and mixed&#8208;cation perovskites demonstrate ferromagnetic behavior. According to optical measurements, mixed&#8208;cation perovskite has the lowest band gap (1.53 eV) of all MA and all Cs perovskites. In comparison to all MA and all Cs perovskites, the mixed&#8208;cation perovskite solar cell exhibits the lowest Voc losses. These findings demonstrate the importance of cation&#8208;engineering in developing innovative materials with novel properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the biosynthetic capacity of TsrM, a B12&#8208;dependent Radical SAM Enzyme Catalyzing Non&#8208;radical Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>B12&#8208;dependent radical SAM enzymes are an emerging enzyme family with approximately 200,000 proteins. These enzymes have been shown to catalyze chemically challenging reactions such as methyl transfer to  sp2  &#8208; and  sp3  &#8208;hybridized carbon atoms. However, to date we have little information regarding their complex mechanisms and their biosynthetic potential. Here we show, using X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, mutagenesis and synthetic probes that the vitamin B12&#8208;dependent radical SAM enzyme TsrM catalyzes not only C&#8208; but also N&#8208;methyl transfer reactions further expanding its synthetic versatility. We also demonstrate that TsrM has the unique ability to directly transfer a methyl group to the benzyl core of tryptophan, including the least reactive position C4. Collectively, our study supports that TsrM catalyzes non&#8208;radical reactions and establishes the usefulness of radical SAM enzymes for novel biosynthetic schemes including serial alkylation reactions at particularly inert C&#8208;H bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Complexes of Singly, Doubly and Triply Linked Porphyrins and Corroles: An Insight into the Physicochemical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal complexes of directly linked metalloporphyrine and corrole oligomers have been extensively studied due to their intriguing optical and electronic properties. In this regard, the impact of the different type of direct linkages on electrochemical, magnetic, electronic and electrocatalytic properties of various metallopophyrine and corrole oligomers have been discussed at length in this Review article.







Abstract
Metal complexes of multi&#8208;porphyrins and multi&#8208;corroles are unique systems that display a host of extremely interesting properties. Availability of free meso and &#946; positions allow formation of different types of directly linked bis&#8208;porphyrins giving rise to intriguing optical and electronic properties. While the fields of metalloporphyrin and corroles monomer have seen exponential growth in the last decades, the chemistry of metal complexes of bis&#8208;porphyrins and bis&#8208;corroles remain rather underexplored. Therefore, the impact of covalent linkages on the optical, electronic, (spectro)electrochemical, magnetic and electrocatalytic activities of metal complexes of bis&#8208;porphyrins and &#8208;corroles has been summarized in this review article. This article shows that despite the (still) somewhat difficult synthetic access to these molecules, their extremely exciting properties do make a strong case for pursuing research on these classes of compounds.

         <dc:description>The synthesis and characterization of a homologous series of quinoid sulfur&#8208;containing imidazolyl&#8208;substituted heteroacenes is described. The optoelectronic and magnetic properties were investigated by UV/vis, fluorescence and EPR spectroscopy as well as quantum chemical calculations and were compared to the corresponding benzo congener. The room&#8208;temperature and atmosphere&#8208;stable quinoids display strong absorption in the NIR region between 678&#8211;819 nm. The dithieno[3,2&#8208;  b  :2',3'&#8208;  d  ]thiophene derivative and the thieno[2',3':4,5]thieno[3,2&#8208;  b  ]thieno[2,3&#8208;  d  ]thiophene derivative were EPR active at room temperature. For the latter, variable temperature EPR spectroscopy revealed the presence of a thermally accessible triplet state, with a singlettriplet separation of 14.1 kJ/mol.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;performance heterogeneous thermocatalysis caused by catalyst wettability regulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalyst wettability regulation has emerged as an attractive approach for high catalytic performance for the past few years. By introducing appropriate wettability, the molecule diffusion of reactants and products can be enhanced, leading to high activity. Besides, undesired molecules are isolated for high selectivity of target products and long&#8208;term stability of catalyst. Herein, we summarize wettability induced high&#8208;performance heterogeneous thermocatalysis in recent years, including hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity, hybrid hydrophilicity&#8208;hydrophobicity, amphiphilicity, and superaerophilicity. Relevant reactions are further classified and described according to the reason for the performance improvement. It should be pointed out that studies of utilizing superaerophilicity to improve heterogeneous thermocatalytic performance have been included for the first time, so this is a comparatively comprehensive review in this field as yet.</dc:description>

         <title>Planar Chiral Rhodium Complexes of 1,4&#8208;Benzoquinones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral rhodium complexes are widely used in asymmetric catalysis. Herein we describe a new approach to such chiral complexes featuring the intrinsically achiral benzoquinone ligands. The synthesis was achieved by the face&#8208;selective coordination of 2,5&#8208;substituted benzoquinones with rhodium bearing the readily available oxazoline&#8208;phenolate ligand. This chiral auxiliary ligand was subsequently replaced with retention of the planar chirality of (diene)Rh fragment. The selectivity of metal coordination was quantitatively predicted by DFT calculations before the actual synthesis.







Abstract
Diene rhodium complexes are important catalysts in modern organic synthesis. Herein, we report a new approach to such complexes with the uncommon planar chirality. The synthesis is achieved by face&#8208;selective coordination of the prochiral 2,5&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinones (R2&#8208;Q) with rhodium precursors containing the chiral auxiliary ligand S&#8208;salicyl&#8208;oxazoline (S&#8208;Salox). Such coordination leads to the formation of (R,R&#8208;R2&#8208;Q)Rh(S&#8208;Salox) complexes in high yields and with exceptional diastereoselectivity (d.&#8201;r.&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1). Subsequent replacement of the auxiliary ligand provides various benzoquinone rhodium complexes with retention of the planar chirality. Combined theoretical and experimental studies show that due to their electron&#8208;withdrawing nature benzoquinones bind metals stronger than the related 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene, but weaker than other common diene ligands, such as cyclooctadiene.

         <title>Evidence of Kinetically Relevant Consistency in Thermal and Photo&#8208;Thermal HCOOH Decomposition over Pd/LaCrO3/C3N4 Composite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photo&#8208;energy and thermal&#8208;energy in a synergetic way promote catalytic reaction together. In this article, the C&#8722;H bond rupture within HCOOH* was determined to be the rate&#8208;determining step with adsorbed CO* as the most abundant surface intermediates (MASIs) under both thermal and photo&#8208;thermal reaction conditions confirmed by kinetic isotopic effects and in situ FTIR characterizations. Clear evidence of kinetically relevant consistency was determined under both thermal and photo&#8208;thermal HCOOH decomposition reactions over Pd/LaCrO3/C3N4 composite.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;thermal catalysis has been an attractive alternative strategy to promote chemical reactions for years, however, how light cooperates with thermal energy is still unclear. We meet this demand by exploring reaction mechanism via pressure dependency studies as well as H/D exchange experiments with HCOOH decomposition as a probe over a palladium nanoparticle (Pdn) and isolated Pd (Pd1) decorated LaCrO3/C3N4 composite catalyst, in which the H2 formation rate shows a first&#8208;order dependence on HCOOH and inverse first&#8208;order dependence on CO partial pressures no matter the reaction was driven by thermal or photo&#8208;thermal energy. Additionally, negligible kinetic isotopic effects (KIEs: kH/kD) were determined under both dark and light conditions at 1.04 and 1.18 when the HCOOH was replaced by HCOOD. Besides, when the reactant HCOOH was further replaced by DCOOD, the KIE values of 1.55 (dark) and 1.92 (light) were obtained, which indicates that the HCOOH decomposition follows kinetically relevant (KR) of C&#8722;H bond rupture within HCOOH molecule under both thermal and photo&#8208;thermal reaction conditions and the catalytic surface was found to be densely covered by CO based on the pressure dependency studies as well as the in&#8197;situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis. Clearly, the HCOOH decomposition driven by thermal and photo&#8208;thermal energy follows the same reaction mechanism. Nevertheless, light induced hot electrons and the derived thermal effect do cause the enhancement of the reaction activity in some circumstances compared with bare thermal catalysis, which clarifies the confusion on cooperation mechanism of photo and thermal energies from the kinetic perspective. Hot electrons induced by photo&#8208;illumination was confirmed by in&#8197;situ FTIR CO chemisorption with &#8764;10&#8197;cm&#8722;1 redshift identified of the CO feature once light was introduced. Meanwhile, the photo thermal reaction system suffers from severe electron&#8208;hole re&#8208;combination at high reaction temperatures and make the thermal effect of photo irradiation dominant with respect to the effect at low reaction temperatures. This research provides insight to the mechanism on how photo&#8208;thermal reaction works and draws attention to the photo&#8208;thermal reaction process in boosting catalytic activity.

         <title>Vinylcyclopropane [3+2] Cycloaddition with Acetylenic Sulfones Based on Visible Light Photocatalysis**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new visible light&#8208;mediated intermolecular [3+2] cycloaddition reaction of meta photocycloadducts with acetylenic sulfones catalyzed by iridium complexes has been developed. The strain energy contained in the photogenerated vinylcyclopropane system enables efficient access to a new complex molecular scaffold under very mild conditions. DFT&#8208;calculations and time&#8208;resolved optical spectroscopy studies substantiated a triplet energy transfer mechanism.







Abstract
The first intermolecular visible light [3+2] cycloaddition reaction performed on a meta photocycloadduct employing acetylenic sulfones is described. The developed methodology exploits the advantages of combining UV and visible&#8208;light in a two&#8208;step sequence that provides a photogenerated cyclopropane which, through a strain&#8208;release process, generates a new cyclopentane ring while significantly increasing the molecular complexity. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations indicate an energy transfer pathway for the visible light&#8208;driven reaction step. This strategy could be extended to simpler vinylcyclopropanes.

         <title>A Highly Stable Yttrium Organic Framework as a Host for Optical Thermometry and D2O Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrothermally stable and thermally robust yttrium MOF can be substituted with photoluminescent lanthanide ions to act as a ratiometric luminescent thermometer. Accurate temperature determination is possible up to at least 573&#8197;K, the highest of any MOF reported to date. Monitoring of the luminescent decay lifetime allows detection of D2O in water with a sensitivity suited for practical applications.







Abstract
The yttrium organic framework (Y0.89Tb0.10Eu0.01)6(BDC)7(OH)4(H2O)4 (BDC=benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylate) is hydrothermally stable up to at least 513&#8197;K and thermally stable in air in excess of 673&#8197;K. The relative intensities of luminescence of Tb3+ and Eu3+ are governed by Tb3+&#8208;to&#8208;Eu3+ phonon&#8208;assisted energy transfer and Tb3+&#8208;to&#8208;ligand back transfer and are responsible for the differing temperature&#8208;dependent luminescence of the two ions. This provides a ratiometric luminescent thermometer in the 288&#8211;573&#8197;K temperature range, not previously seen for MOF materials, with a high sensitivity, 1.69&#177;0.04&#8201;%&#8201;K&#8722;1 at 523&#8197;K. In aqueous conditions, loosely bound H2O can be replaced by D2O in the same material, which modifies decay lifetimes to yield a quantitative luminescent D2O sensor with a useful sensitivity for practical application.

Fearless Fluorine: the effect of gem&#8208;diflurination on acidity/basicity (pKa), lipophilicity (LogP), aqueous solubility (Sw), and metabolic stability (intrinsic clearance, CLint) of functionalized C3&#8722;C7&#8208;cycloalkanes is established and compared to those of non&#8208;fluorinated and acyclic counterparts. While the pKa values are varied similarly for the cyclic and acyclic series and can be explained by the inductive effect of the fluorine atoms, the LogP and Sw trends are more complex. The CLint values are retained or slightly improved upon gem&#8208;difluorination.







Abstract
Physico&#8208;chemical properties important to drug discovery (pKa, LogP, and aqueous solubility), as well as metabolic stability, were studied for a series of functionalized gem&#8208;difluorinated cycloalkanes and compared to those of non&#8208;fluorinated and acyclic counterparts to evaluate the impact of the fluorination. It was found that the influence of the CF2 moiety on the acidity/basicity of the corresponding carboxylic acids and amines was defined by inductive the effect of the fluorine atoms and was nearly the same for acyclic and cyclic aliphatic compounds. Lipophilicity and aqueous solubility followed more complex trends and were affected by the position of the fluorine atoms, ring size, and even the nature of the functional group present; also, significant differences were found for the acyclic and cyclic series. Also, gem&#8208;difluorination either did not affect or slightly improved the metabolic stability of the corresponding model derivatives. The presented results can be used as a guide for rational drug design employing fluorine and establish the first chapter in a catalog of the key in vitro properties of fluorinated cycloalkanes.

         <title>Development of Strong Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Absorbing Cyclometalated Iridium(III) Complexes for Robust and Efficient Light&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intense and broadband UV&#8208;Vis absorption do matters in iridium(III)&#8208;based photosensitizers for photocatalytic hydrogen generation. This study reveals the importance of choosing an appropriate electron donor on the C^N ligands to improve the performance. The use of triphenylamine&#8208;based Ir(III) PSs shows great potential in boosting the photocatalytic performance.







Abstract
Weak light absorption of common Ir(III) complexes (e.&#8201;g., using phenylpyridine as the ligand) has hindered their applications in photocatalytic hydrogen generation from water as an efficient photosensitizer. To address this issue, a series of cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes (Ir1&#8211;Ir5), featuring different electron&#8208;donating substituents to enhance the absorptivity, have been synthesized and studied as photosensitizers (PSs) for light&#8208;driven hydrogen production from water. Ir6&#8211;Ir7 were prepared as fundamental systems for comparisons. Electron donors, including 9&#8208;phenylcarbazole, triphenylamine, 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dimethoxytriphenylamine, 4,4&#8242;&#8208;di(N&#8208;hexylcarbazole)triphenylamine moieties were introduced on 6&#8208;(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenanthridine&#8208;based cyclometalating (C^N) ligands to explore the donor effect on the hydrogen evolution performance of these cationic Ir(III) complexes. Remarkably, Ir4 with 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dimethoxytriphenylamine achieved the highest turn&#8208;over number (TON) of 12&#8201;300 and initial turnover frequency (TOFi) of 394&#8197;h&#8722;1, with initial activity (activityi) of 547&#8201;000&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and initial apparent quantum yield (AQYi) of 9.59&#8201;%, under the illumination of blue light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) for 105&#8197;hours, which demonstrated a stable three&#8208;component photocatalytic system with high efficiency. The TON (based on n(H2)/n(PSr)) in this study is the highest value reported to date among the similar photocatalytic systems using Ir(III) complexes with Pt nanoparticles as catalyst. The great potential of using triphenylamine&#8208;based Ir(III) PSs in boosting photocatalytic performance has also been shown.

         <title>Hollow Capsule NiCo2NS Prepared by Self&#8208;Sacrificing Template Method for High&#8208;Efficiency Bifunctional Catalyst and Its Application in Zn&#8208;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiCo2NS with a hollow capsule structure was obtained through a self&#8208;sacrificing template method. NiCo2NS exhibited excellent performance in terms of ORR and OER. It shows an overpotential of 154&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.76&#8197;V. The Zn&#8208;air batteries based on NiCo2NS showed excellent cycle stability and small voltage gap. It exhibited a specific capacity of 693&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and kept stable during 1200 charge/discharge cycles.







Abstract
Exploring the application of high&#8208;efficiency bifunctional oxygen catalysts to rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries has been a research hotspot in recent years. We succeeded in obtaining NiCo2NS with a hollow capsule structure through the self&#8208;sacrificing template method, which has a larger specific surface area and can provide more active sites for electrocatalysis relative to his solid. The introduction of S can change the valence distribution of N and the electronic structure of the M&#8722;N bond, so that NiCo2NS exhibits excellent performance in the overpotential and stability of the oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions. It shows an overpotential of 154&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.76&#8197;V. When used as a bi&#8208;functional catalyst in zinc&#8208;air batteries, it exhibits good stability within 400&#8197;h. The flexible battery assembled by NiCo2NS also shows excellent performance, and can be cycled stably for 20&#8197;h. The current maintains good stability when it is bent at different angles during the cycle.

         <title>Skeletal Transformation Triggered by C&#8722;F Bond Activation after Photochemical Rearrangement of Fluorinated [7]Helicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The skeletal transformation of tetrafluorinated [7]helicene continued after a photochemical double fluorine atom transfer. On silica gel, the photoproduct underwent Wagner&#8211;Meerwein rearrangement followed by nucleophilic aromatic substitution. This sequential transformation resulted in elimination of two fluorine atoms, affording a difluorinated carbonyl compound. Hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol enabled the same transformation and served as a nucleophile.







Abstract
Tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;fluorinated [7]helicenes are photolabile and undergo a double fluorine atom transfer. Herein, we show that the transferred product further undergoes a skeletal transformation on silica gel. The transformation begins with activation of the allylic C&#8722;F bond on the silanol surface. Then, the resulting carbocation readily undergoes a regioselective nucleophilic aromatic substitution with water, depending on the position of the fluorine substituents. Hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol also activated the allylic C&#8722;F bond and acted as a nucleophile. These findings support the generation of a highly reactive cationic electrophilic intermediate in the successive transformations involving fluorine atoms.

         <title>Catalytic Oxidation of Veratryl Alcohol Derivatives Using RuCo/rGO Composites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Composites of RuCo alloy nanoparticles and reduced graphene oxide (RuCo/rGO) with Ru to Co ratios of 1&#8201;:&#8201;0 to 1.2&#8201;:&#8201;1, can catalyzed effectively C&#945;&#8722;OH in lignin model compounds using O2 as oxidant at 100&#8201;&#176;C for 2&#8197;h, owing to the combination of the intrinsic catalytic activity of Ru, the unique flower&#8208;shaped morphology of RuCo alloy nanoparticles.







Abstract
Chemoselectively oxidizing C&#945;&#8722;OH to C=O has been considered as a key step for the oxidative depolymerization of lignin. In this work, we design and prepare a series of composites of RuCo alloy nanoparticles and reduced graphene oxide (RuCo/rGO) with different Ru to Co ratios and explore their catalytic activities in the oxidation of veratryl alcohol derivatives, which usually serve as the model compounds for studying lignin oxidation. It is illustrated that the Ru to Co ratio determines the morphology and average size of the RuCo alloy nanoparticles on rGO, and the overall catalytic activities of the composites. The RuCo alloy nanoparticles on rGO with Ru to Co ratios of 1&#8201;:&#8201;0 to 1.2&#8201;:&#8201;1 show a unique flower&#8208;shaped morphology that increases the exposure of the active sites and thus promotes their contact with the substrates. The RuCo/rGO composites exhibit high catalytic activities for the oxidation of C&#945;&#8722;OH to aldehydes at 100&#8201;&#176;C for 2&#8197;h. Additionally, the Co component affords the RuCo/rGO composites with magnetic properties that make the separation and recovery of the catalyst simple. Given the high catalytic performances and easy recovery, the RuCo/rGO composites would be potentially useful for the depolymerization of lignin.

         <title>An Alternate [2&#215;2] Grid Constructed Around TiO4N2 Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of an alternate [2&#215;2] grid constructed around four TiO4N2 units is described. This chiral architecture is generated from the 2,2&#8208;bipyrimidine ligand and a tetraphenolic strand. The formation of this tetranuclear assembly is driven by CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interactions. In the course of the self&#8208;assembly process, the system is able to select one diimine ligand in the pool of the initial components.







Abstract
The formation of a tetranuclear self&#8208;assembled species constructed around a TiO4N2 motif is reported. This aggregate is generated from Ti(OiPr)4, 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyrimidine (bpym) and a bis&#8208;biphenol strand (L2H4) where two 2,2&#8217;&#8208;biphenol units are connected with a biphenyl spacer. The solid&#8208;state structure of the [Ti4(L2)4(bpym)4] architecture reveals the formation of an unprecedented chiral alternate [2&#215;2] grid. In addition to the structural characterization of the [Ti4(L2)4(bpym)4] architecture, geometry optimisation on various possible isomeric tetrameric assemblies ([2&#215;2] grid, alternate [2&#215;2] grid, circular helicate or cyclic hemihelicate) is performed using DFT calculations. These results confirm the higher stability of the alternate [2&#215;2] grid over the other possible tetranuclear isomers and allow examining the replacement of the bpym ligands by two novel diimine chelates within the tetranuclear assembly (2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine=bipy and 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyrazine=bipyraz). From this initial theoretical investigation, the competition between these three nitrogen ligands in the course of the self&#8208;assembly process is next evaluated. Overall, this investigation shows that the exclusive formation of the alternate [2&#215;2] grid is driven by CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interactions.

         <title>Novel thienyl DPP derivatives functionalized with terminal electron acceptor groups: synthesis, optical properties and OFET performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three novel diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) based small molecules have been synthesized and characterized in terms of their chemical&#8208;physical, electrochemical and electrical properties. All the molecules consist of a central DPP electron acceptor core symmetrically functionalized with donor bi&#8208;thienyl moieties and flanked in the terminal positions by three different auxiliary electron&#8208;acceptor groups. This kind of molecular structure, characterized by an alternation of electron acceptor and donor groups, was purposely designed to provide a significant absorption at the longer wavelengths of the visible spectrum: when analysed as thin films, in fact, the dyes absorb well over 800 nm and exhibit a narrow optical bandgap down to 1.28 eV. A detailed DFT analysis provides useful information on the electronic structure of the dyes and on the features of the main optical transitions. Organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) have been fabricated by depositing the DPP dyes as active layers from solution: the different end&#8208;functionalization of the dyes had an effect on the charge transport properties with two of the dyes acting as n&#8208;type semiconductors (electron mobility up to 4.4&#8729;10  &#8208;2  cm  2  /V&#8729;s) and the third one as a p&#8208;type semiconductor (hole mobility up to 2.3&#8729;10  &#8208;3  cm  2  /V&#8729;s). Interestingly, well&#8208;balanced ambipolar transistors were achieved by blending the most performant n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type dyes with hole and electron mobility in the order of 10  &#8208;3  cm  2  /V&#8729;s</dc:description>

         <title>Ene&#8208;Reductase: A Multifaceted Biocatalyst in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ene&#8208;reductases (ERs) are a promising biocatalyst that reduces unsaturated double bonds cooperatively with transition metals, besides they are amiable with other emergent techniques like photoenzymatic, chemoenzymatic, multi&#8208;enzymatic, photoelectrochemical, single reduction chemistry, and radical&#8208;mediated transformations. These techniques will influence the enzymologist and synthetic chemist to explore and expand the intriguing chemistries displayed by ERs for academic and industrial purposes.







Abstract
Biocatalysis integrate microbiologists, enzymologists, and organic chemists to access the repertoire of pharmaceutical and agrochemicals with high chemoselectivity, regioselectivity, and enantioselectivity. The saturation of carbon&#8208;carbon double bonds by biocatalysts challenges the conventional chemical methodology as it bypasses the use of precious metals (in combination with chiral ligands and molecular hydrogen) or organocatalysts. In this line, Ene&#8208;reductases (ERs) from the Old Yellow Enzymes (OYEs) family are found to be a prominent asymmetric biocatalyst that is increasingly used in academia and industries towards unparalleled stereoselective trans&#8208;hydrogenations of activated C=C bonds. ERs gained prominence as they were used as individual catalysts, multi&#8208;enzyme cascades, and in conjugation with chemical reagents (chemoenzymatic approach). Besides, ERs&#8217; participation in the photoelectrochemical and radical&#8208;mediated process helps to unlock many scopes outside traditional biocatalysis. These up&#8208;and&#8208;coming methodologies entice the enzymologists and chemists to explore, expand and harness the chemistries displayed by ERs for industrial settings. Herein, we reviewed the last five year's exploration of organic transformations using ERs.

         <title>Highly Sensitive &#8220;Off/On&#8221; EPR Probes to Monitor Enzymatic Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study are reported two off/on EPR probes containing a nitroxide radical to study the enzymatic activity of carboxylesterases. Thanks to their low solubility in water, they aggregate to form stable micelles, which makes the probes EPR silent. In presence of the esterases enzymes the nitroxide radicals are release from the micelle giving an off/on transition and intense signal.







Abstract
The assessment of unregulated level of enzyme activity is a crucial parameter for early diagnoses in a wide range of pathologies. In this study, we propose the use of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) as an easy method to probe carboxylesterase (CE) enzymatic activity in&#8197;vitro. For this application, were synthesized two amphiphilic, nitroxide containing esters, namely Tempo&#8208;C12 (T&#8208;C12) and Tempo&#8208;2&#8208;C12 (T&#8208;2&#8208;C12). They exhibit low solubility in water and form stable micelles in which the radicals are EPR almost silent, but the hydrolysis of the ester bond yields narrows and intense EPR signals. The intensity of the EPR signals is proportional to the enzymatic activity. CEs1, CEs2 and esterase from porcine liver (PLE) were investigated. The obtained results show that T&#8208;C12 and T&#8208;2&#8208;C12&#8208;containing systems display a much higher selectivity toward the CEs2, with a Limit of Detection of the same order of those ones obtained with optical methods.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In this study&lt;/b&gt; are reported two off/on EPR probes containing a nitroxide radical to study the enzymatic activity of carboxylesterases. Thanks to their low solubility in water, they aggregate to form stable micelles, which makes the probes EPR silent. In presence of the esterases enzymes the nitroxide radicals are release from the micelle giving an off/on transition and intense signal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assessment of unregulated level of enzyme activity is a crucial parameter for early diagnoses in a wide range of pathologies. In this study, we propose the use of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) as an easy method to probe carboxylesterase (CE) enzymatic activity in&#8197;vitro. For this application, were synthesized two amphiphilic, nitroxide containing esters, namely Tempo-C12 (T-C12) and Tempo-2-C12 (T-2-C12). They exhibit low solubility in water and form stable micelles in which the radicals are EPR almost silent, but the hydrolysis of the ester bond yields narrows and intense EPR signals. The intensity of the EPR signals is proportional to the enzymatic activity. CEs1, CEs2 and esterase from porcine liver (PLE) were investigated. The obtained results show that T-C12 and T-2-C12-containing systems display a much higher selectivity toward the CEs2, with a Limit of Detection of the same order of those ones obtained with optical methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Femtosecond Spectroscopy and Nonlinear Optical Properties of aza&#8208;BODIPY Derivatives in Solution</title>

         <dc:description>
The fast relaxation processes in the excited electronic states of functionalized aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (aza&#8208;BODIPY) derivatives were investigated in liquid media at room temperature, including the linear photophysical, photochemical, and nonlinear optical (NLO) properties.







Abstract
The fast relaxation processes in the excited electronic states of functionalized aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (aza&#8208;BODIPY) derivatives (1&#8211;4) were investigated in liquid media at room temperature, including the linear photophysical, photochemical, and nonlinear optical (NLO) properties. Optical gain was revealed for nonfluorescent derivatives 3 and 4 in the near infrared (NIR) spectral range under femtosecond excitation. The values of two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) and excited&#8208;state absorption (ESA) cross&#8208;sections were obtained for 1&#8211;4 in dichloromethane using femtosecond Z&#8208;scans, and the role of bromine substituents in the molecular structures of 2 and 4 is discussed. The nature of the excited states involved in electronic transitions of these dyes was investigated using quantum&#8208;chemical TD&#8208;DFT calculations, and the obtained spectral parameters are in reasonable agreement with the experimental data. Significant 2PA (maxima cross&#8208;sections &#8764;2000&#8197;GM), and large ESA cross&#8208;sections &#8764;10&#8722;20&#8197;m2 of these new aza&#8208;BODIPY derivatives 1&#8211;4 along with their measured high photostability reveal their potential for photonic applications in general and optical limiting in particular.

         <title>Tribo&#8208;Excited Chemical Reaction Using an EuIII Complex with a Stacked Anthracene Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tribo&#8208;excitation in a crystalline compound is an interesting phenomenon in which a mechanical stimulus drives the compound to its excited state. We demonstrate a tribo&#8208;excited chemical reaction using trivalent europium (EuIII) and gadolinium (GdIII) complexes with stacked anthracene ligands for the development of tribo&#8208;excitation chemistry. The tribo&#8208;oxidation and &#8208;dimerization reactions in the stacked anthracene ligands occur in the EuIII and GdIII complexes, respectively. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y.&#8197;Kitagawa, Y.&#8197;Hasegawa et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104401).

         <dc:description>Hedycaryol is a strained 10&#8208;membered monocyclic sesquiterpene alcohol whose chemistry is characterised by its transannular acid catalysed and thermal (Cope) reactions. The compound is widespread in nature and serves as an important biosynthetic intermediate towards many other sesquiterpene alcohols including eudesmols, guaiols and rearranged compounds. This review summarises the known natural products derived through terpene cyclisations from hedycaryol. For each compound, if it has been assigned experimentally, the rationale for its absolute configuration is discussed.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The continuous flow, enantioselective, organophotoredox catalytic asymmetric alkylation of aldehydes was studied, by using a homemade, custom designed photoreactor for reactions under cryogenic conditions. Going from microfluidic conditions up to a 10 mL mesofluidic reactor, an increase of productivity by almost 18000% compared to the batch reaction was demonstrated. Finally, for the first time, a stereoselective photoredox organocatalytic continuous flow reaction in a fully telescoped process for an API synthesis was successfully achieved.

         <title>Foldable detergents&#160;for membrane protein study: Importance of detergent core flexibility in protein stabilization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane proteins are of biological and pharmaceutical significance. However, their structural study is extremely challenging mainly due to the fact that only a small number of chemical tools is suitable for stabilizing membrane proteins in solution. Detergents are widely used in membrane protein study, but conventional detergents are generally poor at stabilizing challenging membrane proteins such as G protein&#8208;coupled receptors and protein complexes. In the current study, we prepared tandem triazine&#8208;based maltosides (TZMs) with two amphiphilic triazine units connected by different diamine linkers, hydrazine (TZM&#8208;Hs) and 1,2&#8208;ethylenediamine (TZM&#8208;Es). These TZMs were consistently superior to a gold standard detergent (DDM) in terms of stabilizing a few membrane proteins. In addition, the TZM&#8208;Es containing a long linker showed more general protein stabilization efficacy with multiple membrane proteins than the TZM&#8208;Hs containing a short linker. This result indicates that introduction of the flexible1,2&#8208;ethylenediamine linker between two rigid triazine rings enables the TZM&#8208;Es to fold into favourable conformations in order to promote membrane protein stability. The novel concept of detergent foldability introduced in the current study has potential use for rational detergent design and membrane protein applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Aaptaminoids are a unique family of marine alkaloids bearing a benzo[  de  ][1,6]&#8208;naphthyridine core. This work describes the first total synthesis of suberitines A&#8208;D (  1  &#8208;  4  ), four typical dimeric natural aaptaminoids, employing a step&#8208;saving bidirectional strategy. Key methods applied in the total synthesis include a cationic cascade to construct the bis&#8208;isoquinoline(s) with Hendrickson reagent&#8208;mediated Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;type cyclization and eliminative aromatization, and a Bronsted acid&#8208;promoted Vilsmeier cyclization to generate the naphthyridine(s). The conditionally tunable PIDA&#8208;mediated oxidative dearomatization and subsequent methanolysis or hydrolysis successfully served as a powerful biomimetic tool to elaborate the essential oxygenated functionalities of suberitines A&#8208;D (  1&#8208;4  ) in proper solvent&#8208;combinations at the final stage of total synthesis. The biomimetic proposal employed in the late&#8208;stage redox interchanges of related natural products was eventually supported by the isolation of synthetic intermediate  23a  as a natural product from the same natural source. Biological screening revealed that five of the synthetic samples including two natural suberitines and three full&#8208;skeleton natural product&#8208;like intermediates exhibited low micromolar inhibitory activities against the growth of cancer cell line K562.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of heteroaryl halides with chlorodifluoroacetamides and chlorodifluoroacetates has been developed. The combination of NiCl  2  &#8901;DME with 4,4'&#8208;diNon&#8208;bpy, co&#8208;ligand PPh  3  , and additive LiCl renders the catalytic system efficient for the synthesis of medicinal interest heteroaryldifluoro&#8208;acetamides.

         <title>Elaborated Reaction Pathway of Photothermal Catalytic CO2 Conversion with H2O on Gallium Oxide Decorating and Defective Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, Ga  2  O  3  &#8208;decorated and defective surface models based on anatase TiO  2  were established. The thermodynamic reaction pathways, including protonation, deoxygenation and hydroxylation steps, during CO  2  conversion with H  2  O to C1 products were calculated. The calculation results demonstrate that the Ga  2  O  3  cocatalyst enhances the selective adsorption of CO  2  and slightly weakens the competitive adsorption of H  2  O. The promotion effect of Ga  2  O  3  on the subsequent reaction depends on the availability of protons and electrons. Free energy calculations revealed that the basic functional site generated by Ga  2  O  3  not only suppresses the back reaction of the OH group after H  2  O directly provides protons but also maintains the surface defect oxygen vacancy (V  O  ), which promotes the reaction thermodynamics but tends to be consumed in the process. Additionally, Ga  2  O  3  decoration promotes V  O  formation, and the coexistence of Ga  2  O  3  and V  O  further decreases the reaction rate&#8208;determining step energy barrier, promoting C1 production.</dc:description>

         <title>Metalloimmunotherapy with rhodium and ruthenium complexes: Targeting tumor&#8208;associated macrophages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) suppress the cancer immune response and are a key target for immunotherapy. The effects of ruthenium and rhodium complexes on TAMs have not been well characterized. To address this gap in the field, a panel of 22 dirhodium and ruthenium complexes were screened against three subtypes of macrophages, triple&#8208;negative breast cancer and normal breast tissue cells. Experiments were carried out in 2D and biomimetic 3D co&#8208;culture experiments with and without irradiation with blue light. Leads were identified with cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific toxicity toward macrophage subtypes, cancer cells, or both. Experiments with 3D spheroids revealed complexes that sensitized the tumor models to the chemotherapeutic doxorubicin. Cell surface exposure of calreticulin, a known&#160;facilitator&#160;of immunogenic cell death (ICD), was increased upon treatment, along with a&#160;concomitant&#160;reduction in the M2&#8208;subtype classifier arginase. Our findings lay a strong foundation for the future development of ruthenium&#8208; and rhodium&#8208;based chemotherapies targeting TAMs.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemically Driven Swinging of a Nitrobenzyl Pendant Arm in a Nickel Scorpionand Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A radical anion &#8211;NO  2  &#8226;  &#8722;  is formed upon an electrochemically reversible one&#8208;electron reduction of the square&#8208;planar Ni  II  complex of  N  &#8208;nitrobenzylcyclam. The &#8211;NO  2  &#8226;  &#8722;  group goes to occupy an axial position of the metal ion, thus establishing a significant electronic interaction with the metal center. In particular, the ESR spectrum supports the occurrence of an electron transfer from &#8722;NO  2  &#8226;  &#8722;  to the metal, which therefore presents a significant Ni  I  character. On re&#8208;oxidation, the nitrobenzyl side&#8208;chain detaches and the Ni  II  complex is restored, providing an example of a fully reversible redox driven intramolecular motion.</dc:description>

The bridging ligands are laterally &#960;&#8208;extended by anellating a pyrene (  Ru2&#8208;7  ,  Ru2&#8208;8  ) or a 6,7&#8208;benzoquinoxaline (  Ru2&#8208;3  ,  Ru2&#8208;4  ) &#960;&#8208;perimeter. This was done with the hope that the open &#960;&#8208;faces of the electron&#8208;rich complexes will foster association with planar electron acceptors via &#960;&#8208;stacking. The dinuclear complexes were subjected to cyclic and square wave voltammetry and were characterized in all accessible redox states by IR, UV/Vis/NIR and, where applicable, by EPR spectroscopy.

The more electron&#8208;rich acac  &#8208;  congeners formed non&#8208;conductive 1:1 charge&#8208;transfer (CT) salts on treatment with the F4TCNQ electron acceptor.

         <title>Olefin Metathesis Catalysts generated In Situ from Molybdenum(VI)&#8208;Oxo Complexes by Tuning Pendant Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tailored molybdenum(VI)&#8208;oxo complexes of the form MoOCl2(OR)2(OEt)2 catalyse olefin metathesis upon reaction with an organosilicon reducing agent at low temperature, e.g. 70&#176;C, in the presence of olefins. While this reactivity parallels what has recently been observed in the corresponding classical heterogeneous catalysts based on supported metal oxide, the well&#8208;defined nature of our starting systems allows us to understand the influence of structural, spectroscopic and electronic characteristics of the catalytic precursor on the initiation and catalytic proficiency of the final species. The catalytic performance of the pre&#8208;catalysts follows the highly electron withdrawing (&#963;&#8208;donation) character of alkoxide ligands, OtBuF9 being the best. This activity correlates with both the 95Mo chemical shift and the reduction potential that follows the same trend: OtBuF9 &gt; OtBuF6 &gt; OtBuF3.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Photoisomerization of&#160;N,N'&#8208;disubstituted Indigos</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N,N&#8217;  &#8208;disubstituted indigos are photoswitchable molecules that have recently caught the attention due to their addressability by red&#8208;light.&#160;&#160;When alkyl and aryl groups are utilized as the&#160;  N  &#8208;substituents, the thermal half&#8208;lives of&#160;  Z  isomers can be tuned independently while maintaining the advantageous red&#8208;shifted absorption spectra.&#160;&#160;To utilize these molecules in real&#8208;world applications, it is of immense importance to understand how their molecular structures as well as the environment influence their switching properties.&#160;&#160;To this end, we probed their photoisomerization mechanism by carrying out photophysical and computational studies in solvents of different polarities.&#160;&#160;The fluorescence and transient absorption experiments suggest for more polar excited and transition states, which explains the bathochromic shifts of absorption spectra and shorter thermal half&#8208;lives.&#160;&#160;On the other hand, the quantum chemical calculations reveal that in contrast to&#160;  N  &#8208;carbonyl groups,&#160;  N  &#8208;alkyl and&#160;  N  &#8208;aryl substituents are not strongly conjugated with the indigo chromophore and can thus serve as a tool for tuning the thermal stability of&#160;  Z  &#160;isomers.&#160;&#160;Both approaches are combined to provide in&#8208;depth understandings of how indigos undergo photoswitching as well as how they are influenced by&#160;  N  &#8208;substituent and the chemical surroundings.&#160;&#160;These mechanistic insights will serve as guiding principles for designing molecules eyeing broader applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantum Chemistry&#8208;based Molecular Dynamics Simulations as a Tool for the Assignment of ESI&#8208;MS/MS Spectra of Drug Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In organic mass spectrometry, fragment ions provide important information on the analyte as a central part of its structure elucidation. With increasing molecular size and possible protonation sites, the potential energy surface (PES) of the analyte can become very complex, which results in a large number of possible fragmentation patterns. Quantum chemical (QC) calculations can help here, enabling the fast calculation of the PES and thus enhancing the mass spectrometry&#8208;based structure elucidation processes. In this work, the previously unknown fragmentation pathways of the two drug molecules Nateglinide (45 atoms) and Zopiclone (51 atoms) were investigated using a combination of&#160;generic formalisms and calculations conducted with the Quantum Chemical Mass Spectrometry (QCxMS) program. The computations of the de novo fragment spectra were conducted with the semi&#8208;empirical GFNn&#8208;xTB (n = 1, 2) methods and compared against Orbitrap measured electrospray ionization (ESI) spectra in positive ion mode. It was found that the unbiased QC calculations are particularly suitable to predict non&#8208;evident fragment ion structures, sometimes contrasting the accepted generic formulation of fragment ion structures from electron migration rules, where the "true" ion fragment structures are approximated. For the first time, all fragment and intermediate structures of these large&#8208;sized&#160;molecules could be elucidated completely and routinely using this merger of methods, finding new&#160;undocumented mechanisms, that are not considered in common rules published so far. Given the importance of ESI for medicinal chemistry, pharmacokinetics, and metabolomics, this approach can significantly enhance the mass spectrometry&#8208;based structure elucidation processes and contribute to the understanding of previously unknown fragmentation pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering of Portable Smartphone Integrated with Liposome&#8208;Encapsulated Curcumin for Onsite Visual Ratiometric Fluorescence Imaging of Hypochlorite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precisely onsite monitoring of hypochlorite (ClO  &#8722;  ) is of great significance to guide its rational use, reducing/avoiding its potential threat toward food safety and human health. Considering ClO  &#8722;  could quench fluorescence of curcumin (CCM) by oxidizing the  o  &#8208;methoxyphenol of CCM into benzoquinone, we designed a portable ratiometric fluorescence sensor integrated with smartphone for realizing the visual point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing (POCT) of ClO  &#8722;  . The amphiphilic phospholipid polymer was used as carrier to wrap curcumin, forming a novel liposome&#8208;encapsulated CCM, which provided a scaffold to bind with [Ru(bpy)  3  ]  2+  through electrostatic interaction, thus assembling [Ru(bpy)  3  ]  2+  &#8208;functionalized liposome&#8208;encapsulated CCM ([Ru(bpy)  3  ]  2+  @CCM&#8208;NPs). Further integrated with smartphone, visual imaging of [Ru(bpy)  3  ]  2+  @CCM&#8208;NPs could be achieved and the accurate onsite detection of ClO  &#8722;  could be realized with a detection limit of 66.31 nM and a linear range of 0.2210 to 80.0 &#956;M. In addition, the sensor could monitor ClO  &#8722;  in real samples with an onsite detection time of ~ 154.0 s.</dc:description>

         <title>Hetero&#8208;substituted &#945;&#946;&#8208;fused BODIPY</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report the synthesis and properties of heterosubtituted &#945;&#946;fused BODIPY fluorophores. The compounds were obtained in good yields by sequential and selective Stille cross&#8208;coupling reactions from 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrahalo&#8208;BODIPY, allowing the introduction of different subtituents at the 3,5 and 2,6 positions of the BODIPY ring. The final fused compounds were synthesized using oxidative cyclisation with ferrous chloride. The fully fused compounds show a strong bathochromically shifted emission along with a hyperchromic shift of the absorption maxima. The fluorescence quantum yields remain relatively large for compounds emitting in this wavelength range.

         <title>Relativistic Spin&#8211;Orbit Electronegativity and the Chemical Bond between a Heavy Atom and a Light Atom</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Relativistic effects are known to alter the chemical bonds and spectroscopic properties of heavy&#8208;element compounds. In this work, we introduce the concept of spin&#8211;orbit (SO) electronegativity of a heavy atom as reflected by an SO&#8208;induced change in the interatomic distance between the heavy atom (HA) and a neighboring light atom (LA). We provide a transparent interpretation of these SO effects by using the concept of spin&#8211;orbit electron deformation density (SO&#8208;EDD). Spin&#8211;orbit coupling at the HA induces rearrangement of the electron density for the scalar&#8208;relativistically optimized geometry that in turn exerts a new force on the LA. The resulting expansion or contraction of the HA&#8211;LA bond depends on the nature and electron configuration of the HA. In addition, we quantify the change in atomic electronegativity induced by SO coupling for a series of hydrides, complementing the SO&#8208;EDD picture. The trends in the SO&#8208;induced electronegativity and the HA&#8211;LA bond distance across the Periodic Table of Elements are demonstrated and interpreted, and also linked, intuitively, with the SO&#8208;induced NMR shielding at the LA.</dc:description>

         <title>Decoration Strategy in Para Boron Position: An Effective Way to Achieve Ideal Multi&#8208;Resonance Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Narrowband, full&#8208;color, and quenching&#8208;resistant emitters are urgently needed for the next generation high&#8208;resolution displays. Though the flourishment of narrowband multiple resonance (MR) emitters in blue region, these materials still face thorny challenges such as effective light&#8208;color regulation strategies and concentration&#8208;induced spectral broadening/emission quenching. Herein, we highlight the research status of an effective "decoration strategy for para B position". On one hand, the introduction of an electron donor or acceptor could induce a hypochromatic&#8208; or bathochromic&#8208;shift emission respectively without undesirable FWHM broadening. On the other hand, a more advanced molecular motif is further proposed through adopting a peripheral benzene ring on the para position of the B&#8208;substituted phenyl in MR core to construct the high&#8208;purity, high&#8208;efficiency, quenching&#8208;resistant and stable MR emitters. Such concept is expected to provide a possible way for the modification, optimization and expansion of MR emitters to meet more possible applications.</dc:description>

         <title>DoE&#8208;driven development of an organocatalytic enantioselective addition of acetaldehyde&#160;to nitrostyrenes in water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of an enantioselective enamine&#8208;catalysed addition of masked acetaldehyde to nitroalkenes via a rational approach helped to move away from the use of chloroform. The presented research allows the use of water as a reaction medium, therefore improving the industrial relevance of a protocol to access very important pharmaceutical intermediates. Critical to the success is the use of chemometrics&#8208;assisted &#8216;Design of Experiments&#8217; (DoE) optimisation during the development of the presented new synthetic approach, which allows to investigate the chemical space in a rational way.</dc:description>

         <title>Strong Antibiotic Activity of the Myxocoumarin Scaffold in vitro and in vivo</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The increasing emergence of resistances against established antibiotics is a substantial threat to human health. The discovery of new compounds with potent antibiotic activity is thus of utmost importance. Within this work, we identify strong antibiotic activity of the natural product myxocoumarin B from Stigmatella aurantiaca MYX&#8208;030 against a range of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens, including clinical isolates of MRSA. A focused library of structural analogs was synthesized to explore initial structure&#8208;activity relationships and to identify equipotent myxocoumarin derivatives devoid of the natural nitro substituent to significantly streamline synthetic access. The cytotoxicity of the myxocoumarins as well as their potential to cure bacterial infections in vivo was established using a zebrafish model system. Our results reveal the exceptional antibiotic activity of the myxocoumarin scaffold and hence its potential for the development of novel antibiotics.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanohybridization of CoS2/MoS2 heterostructure  with polyoxometalate on functionalized reduced graphene oxide for high&#8208;performance LIBs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To address the poor cycling stability and low rate capability of MoS  2  as electrode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), herein, the CoS  2  /MoS  2  /PDDA&#8208;rGO/PMo  12  nanocomposites are constructed via a simple hydrothermal process, combining the advantages of all three, namely, CoS  2  /MoS  2  heterojunction and polyoxometalates (POMs) provide abundant catalytically active sites and increase the multi&#8208;electron transfer ability, and the positively charged poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) modified reduced graphene oxide (PDDA&#8208;rGO) improve electronic conductivity and effectively prevent the aggregation of MoS  2  , meanwhile stabilize the negatively charged [PMo  12  O  40  ]  3&#8208;  . After the electrochemical testing, the resulting CoS  2  /MoS  2  /PDDA&#8208;rGO/PMo  12  nanocomposite achieved 1055 mA h g  &#8208;1  initial specific capacities and stabilized at 740 mA h g  &#8208;1  after 150 cycles at 100 mA g  &#8208;1  current density. And the specific capacities of MoS  2  , MoS  2  /PDDA&#8208;rGO, CoS  2  /MoS  2  , and CoS  2  /MoS  2  /PDDA&#8208;rGO were 201, 421, 518, and 589 at 100 mA g  &#8208;1  after 150 cycles, respectively. The fact of the greatly improving capacity of MoS  2  &#8208;based nanocomposites suggests its potential for high performance electrode materials of LIBs. Moreover, the lithium storage mechanism of CoS  2  /MoS  2  /PDDA&#8208;rGO/PMo  12  has been discussed by cyclic voltammetry with different scan rates.</dc:description>

         <title>Marriage of Heterobuckybowls with Triptycene: Molecular Waterwheels for Separating C60 and C70</title>

         <dc:description>Exploration of &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycycles, particularly those have &#960;&#8208;frameworks spread over the three&#8208;dimensional space, is essential in materials science and synthetic chemistry as these chemical entities possess featured optoelectronic properties and supramolecular assembly. Herein, the bowlshaped trichalcogenasumanenes are fused onto three branches of triptycene through pyrazine units, affording waterwheel&#8208;like three&#8208;dimensional polycycles 4a/4b  . Because the three branches on 4a/4b  are chemically equal, the molecular orbitals of 4a/4b  show degenerate feature that results in the strong UV&#8208;Vis absorbance at steady state. The 4a/4b  exhibit photo&#8208;induced charge&#8208;separation and subsequent charge&#8208;redistribution at transient state, leading to excited state absorption in NIR&#8208;II window (1165&#8211;1400 nm). The 4a/4b  are excellent fullerene receptors, and they form the 1 : 1 host&#8208;guest complexes with C 60  /C 70  as proved by spectroscopic titrations and single crystal structure analysis. Moreover, the 4a/4b  show much stronger affinity toward C 70  than C 60  . Consequently, the 4a/4b  are able to separate C 60  and C 70  from their mixture, giving the purity of C 60  up to 99.5%.</dc:description>

         <title>Helical Chiral N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Ligands in Enantioselective Gold Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical&#8208;NHC ligands were for the first time used as chiral ligands in enantioselective gold(I) catalysis. The introduction of the chirality was realized in a key post&#8208;functionalization step and led to the generation of a chiral NHC laterally substituted by a new configurationally stable [5]&#8208;helicoidal moiety. This structural design allowed good activities and high ee values in the gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of N&#8208;tethered enynes.







Abstract
The first chiral helicene&#8208;NHC gold(I) complexes efficient in enantioselective catalysis were prepared. The L&#8208;shaped chiral ligand is composed of an imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;ylidene (IPy) scaffold laterally substituted by a configurationally stable [5]&#8208;helicenoid unit. The chiral information was introduced in a key post&#8208;functionalization step of a NHC&#8208;gold(I) complex bearing a symmetrical anionic fluoreno[5]helicene substituent, leading to a racemic mixture of complexes featuring three correlated elements of chirality, namely central, axial and helical chirality. After HPLC enantiomeric resolution, X&#8208;ray crystallography and theoretical calculations enabled structural and stereochemical characterization of these configurationally stable NHC&#8208;gold(I) complexes. The high potential in asymmetric catalysis is demonstrated in the benchmark cycloisomerization of N&#8208;tethered 1,6&#8208;enynes with up to 95&#8201;:&#8201;5 er.

         <title>Transition Metal Catalyst Free Synthesis of Olefins from Organoboron Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Many boron based olefinations proceed via intermediates with leaving groups &#946;&#8208;positon. These can undergo stereospecific syn&#8208; or anti&#8208;elimination and are useful for the synthesis of complex olefins. Three main strategies emerged differing in the preparation of the pivotal intermediate: (i) Diastereospecific methods like the addition of a boron&#8208;stabilized anion (d1) to an aldehyde or ketone (a1), (ii) Diastereospecific 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangements of boron&#8208;ate&#8208;complexes with appropriate heterocycles and (iii) addition of chiral carbenoids (d1) to boronates with a suitable group in &#945;&#8208;position (a1).







Abstract
Stereoselective preparation of highly substituted olefins is still a severe challenge that requires well defined elimination precursors. Organoboron chemistry is particularly suited for the preparation of molecules with adjacent stereocenters. As organo boron substrates with leaving groups in &#946;&#8208;position can undergo stereospecific syn&#8208; or anti&#8208;elimination, this chemistry harbors great potential for the synthesis of complex olefins. In recent years three main strategies emerged, which differ in their approach to the &#946;&#8208;functionalized organoboron elimination precursor. (i) Stereoselective preparation of such elimination precursor can be achieved by addition of a boron&#8208;stabilized anion (d1) to an aldehyde or ketone (a1) or diastereoselective 1,3&#8208;rearrangement of suitable boron&#8208;ate&#8208;complexes. Stereospecific methods rely either on (ii) diastereospecific 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangement of boron&#8208;ate&#8208;complexes that involve opening of appropriate heterocycles or (iii) addition of chiral carbenoids (d1*) to chiral boronates (a1*) with a leaving group in &#945;&#8208;position.

&#8220;N&#8208;hancing&#8221; the electron&#8208;acceptor strength by isosteric [CH&#8594;N] replacement in the peropyrene polycyclic aromatic core. The synthesis of an octaazaperopyrene (OAPP) dye is described along with its electrochemical and photophysical properties and placed in the general context of N&#8208;heteroatom derivatives of such polycyclic functional dyes. Their strong electron&#8208;acceptor properties render OAPPs borderline cases of molecular stability under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Ortho substituted octaazaperopyrenes (OAPPs) are a new class of functional dyes characterized by their strong electron&#8208;accepting behavior. Herein, the synthesis, as well as the electrochemical and photo physical properties of an OAPP dye, is reported. The OAPP target was prepared via selective nucleophilic substitution at the peri position of a bay chlorinated tetraazaperylene by introduction of four amino&#8208;substituents. The resulting tetraminoperylene was reacted with different acyl chlorides and anhydrides to give the twisted bay chlorinated OAPP derivatives which were isolated in their reduced dihydro&#8208;form. The OAPP target could be obtained via a palladium catalyzed dehalogenation and a subsequent oxidation. The eightfold isosteric [CH&#8594;N] replacement within the peropyrene core structure results in a large decrease of the frontier orbital energies, rendering the target compound a potent oxidant while preserving the planarity of the aromatic core. The radical anion was obtained by reduction of the OAPP with KC8 and characterized by EPR spectroscopy. A general discussion of the number and location of [CH&#8594;N] replacements in peropyrene structures and their frontier orbital energies is provided.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Promoted Radical Ring&#8208;Opening/Pyridylation of Cyclobutanols with N&#8208;Methoxypyridinium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient silver&#8208;catalyzed radical ring&#8208;opening/pyridylation of tertiary cyclobutanol with N&#8208;methoxypyridinium salts has been achieved for the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;ketopyridines. The overall process is thought to occur by &#946;&#8208;scission of the corresponding cyclobutoxy radical to generate an alkyl radical, that adds to the pyridinium salt. A wide range of tertiary cyclobutanols and N&#8208;methoxypyridinium salts are compatible with these reaction conditions.







Abstract
The silver&#8208;promoted reaction of tertiary cyclobutanols with N&#8208;methoxypyridinium salts enables the efficient synthesis of a range of C2&#8208;substituted pyridines. The overall process likely occurs by ring&#8208;opening (via &#946;&#8208;scission) of the cyclobutoxy radical to generate the corresponding &#947;&#8208;keto alkyl radical that itself adds to the pyridinium salt. A wide range of tertiary cyclobutanols and N&#8208;methoxypyridinium salts are compatible with the reaction conditions.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Catalyzed Stereoselective Conjugate Addition Reaction of Aldehydes to C&#8208;Substituted Maleimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Challenging transformation A peptide catalyst facilitated access to succinimides and downstream heterocycles with three contiguous stereogenic centers via stereo&#8208;, chemo&#8208; and regioselective conjugate addition reaction between aldehydes and C&#8208;substituted maleimides.







Abstract
Catalytic stereoselective additions with maleimides are useful one&#8208;step reactions to yield chiral succinimides, molecules that are widespread among therapeutically active compounds but challenging to prepare when the maleimide is C&#8208;substituted. We present the tripeptide H&#8208;Pro&#8208;Pro&#8208;Asp&#8208;NHC12H25 as a catalyst for conjugate addition reactions between aldehydes and C&#8208;substituted maleimides to form succinimides with three contiguous stereogenic centers in high yields and stereoselectivities. The peptidic catalyst is so chemoselective that no protecting group is needed at the imide nitrogen of the maleimides. Derivatization of the succinimides was straightforward and provided access to chiral pyrrolidines, lactones, and lactams. Kinetic studies, including a Hammett plot, provided detailed insight into the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework (MOF) Morphology Control by Design</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A methodology for the controlled production of MOF morphologies through additive design is applied to synthesize new morphologies for a series of crystallographically cubic Zn4O&#8208;based MOFs. This approach broadly provides a model for the design and synthesis of morphologies with desired crystal facets that can be accessed based on an understanding and use of connections between additives and metal cluster across a pore window.







Abstract
Exerting morphological control over metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is critical for determining their catalytic performance and to optimize their packing behavior in areas from separations to fuel gas storage. A mechanism&#8208;based approach to tailor the morphology of MOFs is introduced and experimentally demonstrated for five cubic Zn4O&#8208;based MOFs. This methodology provides three key features: 1) computational screening for selection of appropriate additives to change crystal morphology based on knowledge of the crystal structure alone; 2) use of additive to metal cluster geometric relationships to achieve morphologies expressing desired crystallographic facets; 3) potential for suppression of interpenetration for certain phases.

Binaphthyl&#8208;based xanthene derivatives were prepared through the oxidation of BINOLs promoted by the hypervalent iodine reagent iodosylbenzene (PhIO). Nine&#8208;membered lactones were obtained through a similar oxidative reaction when iodylbenzene (PhIO  2  ) was used.

         <title>Diradicals photogeneration from chloroaryl substituted carboxylic acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the aim of generating new, thermally inaccessible diradicals, potentially able to induce a double&#8208;strand DNA cleavage, the photochemistry of a set of chloroaryl substituted carboxylic acids in polar media was investigated. The photoheterolytic cleavage of the Ar&#8722;Cl bond occurred in each case to form the corresponding triplet phenyl cations. Under basic conditions, the photorelease of the chloride anion was accompanied by an intramolecular electron&#8208;transfer from the carboxylate group to the aromatic radical cationic site to give a diradical species. This latter intermediate could then undergo CO2 loss in a structure&#8208;dependent fashion, according to the stability of the resulting diradical, or abstract hydrogen atom from the medium. In aqueous environment at physiological pH (pH = 7.3), both a phenyl cation and a diradical chemistry was observed. The mechanistic scenario and the role of the various intermediates (aryl cations and diradicals) involved in the process was supported by computational analysis.</dc:description>

This latter intermediate could then undergo CO2 loss in a structure-dependent fashion, according to the stability of the resulting diradical, or abstract hydrogen atom from the medium. In aqueous environment at physiological pH (pH = 7.3), both a phenyl cation and a diradical chemistry was observed. The mechanistic scenario and the role of the various intermediates (aryl cations and diradicals) involved in the process was supported by computational analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hierarchical fibrous honeycomb ceramics with high load capability and low light&#8208;off temperature for the next&#8208;generation auto emissions standards</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel and stringent automotive exhaust gas emissions standards are urgently needed to counter the problems posed by the worsening global climate and environment. However, the traditional cordierite&#8208;based honeycomb ceramics substrates with ultimate pore density have seriously restricted the establishment of new emission standards. Herein, we introduce a novel robust substrate with tailored volume&#8208;specific surface area and low heat capacity. This substrate employs the synergy of high&#8208;strength ceramic fibers and ultrathin TiO  2  nanosheets. The micro&#8208;sized fibers provide support to ensure structural strength during the catalytic reaction, while the nanosheets play the dual role of connecting the fibers and providing a high surface area for catalyst immobilization. The new three&#8208;dimensional (3D) microarchitecture exhibits a high volume&#8208;specific surface area of 3.59 &#215; 10  4  cm  2  /cm  3  , a compressive strength of 2.01 MPa, and remarkable stability after high&#8208;speed air erosion at 800&#176;C. The honeycomb&#8208;like structure exhibit low resistance to gas flow. Furthermore, after loading with Pt and Pd nanoparticles, the composite 3D microarchitecture delivered an excellent catalytic performance and prominent structural stability, with a super low light&#8208;off temperature of 150&#176;C. The outstanding mechanical and thermal stability and the high surface area and light&#8208;off temperature of the new substrate indicate its potential for use as a highly efficient catalytic carrier to meet the next&#8208;generation auto emissions standards.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonfullerene acceptor based organic solar cells (NF&#8208;OSCs) have witnessed rapid progress over the past few years owing to the intensive research efforts on novel electron donor and nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) materials, interfacial engineering, and device processing techniques. Interfacial layers including electron transporting layers (ETL) and hole transporting layers (HTLs) are crucially important in the OSCs for facilitating electron and hole extractions from the photoactive blend to the respective electrodes. In this review, the progress in both ETLs and HTLs for the currently prevailing NF&#8208;OSCs are discussed, in which the ETLs are summarized from the categories of metal oxides, metal chelates, non&#8208;conjugated electrolytes and conjugated electrolytes, and the HTLs are summarized from the categories of inorganic and organic materials. Some facile methods to develop efficient ETL/HTL materials for high&#8208;performance NF&#8208;OSCs are also highlighted. Finally, the futural prospects of ETL/HTL materials for NF&#8208;OSCs are provided.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantitative assessment of ligand substituent effects on &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;contributions to Fe&#8208;N bonds in spin crossover FeII complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The effect of para&#8208;substituent X on the electronic structure of 16 tridentate 4&#8208;X&#8208;(2,6&#8208;di(pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl))&#8208;pyridine (bppX) ligands and the corresponding solution spin crossover [FeII(bppX)2]2+ complexes is analysed further, to supply quantitative insights into the effect of X on the &#963;&#8208;donor and &#960;&#8208;acceptor character of the Fe&#8208;NA(pyridine) bonds. EDA&#8208;NOCV on the 16 LS complexes revealed that neither &#916;Eorb,&#963;+&#960; (R2=0.48) nor &#916;Eorb,&#960; (R2=0.31) correlated with the experimental solution T1/2 values (which are expected to reflect the ligand field imposed on the iron centre), but that &#916;Eorb,&#963; correlates well (R2=0.82) and implies that as X changes from EDG&#224;EWG (Electron Donating to Withdrawing Group), the ligand becomes a better &#963;&#8208;donor. This counter&#8208;intuitive result was further probed by Mulliken analysis of the NA atomic orbitals: NA(px) involved in the Fe&#8208;N &#963;&#8208;bond vs. the perpendicular NA(pz) employed in the ligand aromatic &#960;&#8208;system. &#160;As X changes EDG&#224;EWG, the electron population on NA(pz) decreases, making it a better &#960;&#8208;acceptor, whilst that in NA(px) increases, making it a better &#963;&#8208;bond donor; both increase ligand field, and T1/2 as observed. In 2016, Halcrow, Deeth and co&#8208;workers proposed an intuitively reasonable explanation of the effect of the para&#8208;X substituents on the T1/2 values in this family of complexes, consistent with the calculated MO energy levels, that M&#224;L &#960;&#8208;backdonation dominates in these M&#8208;L bonds. Here the quantitative EDA&#8208;NOCV analysis of the M&#8208;L bond contributions provides a more complete, coherent and detailed picture of the relative impact of M&#8208;L &#963;&#8208; versus &#960;&#8208;bonding in determining the observed T1/2, refining the earlier interpretation and revealing the importance of the &#963;&#8208;bonding. Furthermore, our results are in perfect agreement with the &#916;E(HS&#8208;LS) vs &#963;p+(X) correlation reported in their work</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Bifunctional fluorescent molecular oxoanion probes based on the benzoxadiazole (BD) chromophore are described which integrate a thiourea binding motif and a polymerizable 2&#8208;aminoethyl methacrylate unit in the 4,7&#8208;positions of the BD core. Concerted charge transfer in this electron donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor architecture endows the dyes with strongly Stokes shifted (up to &gt;250 nm) absorption and fluorescence. Binding of electron&#8208;rich carboxylate guests at the thiourea receptor leads to further analyte&#8208;induced red&#8208;shifts of the emission, shifting the fluorescence maximum of the complexes to &#8805;700 nm. Association constants for acetate are ranging from 1&#8211;5 &#215; 10  5  M  &#8211;1  in acetonitrile. Integration of one of the fluorescent probes via its polymerizable moiety into molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) grafted from the surface of submicron silica cores yielded fluorescent MIP&#8208;coated particle probes for the selective detection of antibiotics containing aliphatic carboxylate groups such as enoxacin (ENOX) at micromolar concentrations in highly polar solvents like acetonitrile.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigating a Boronate&#8208;Affinity&#8208;Guided Acylation Reaction for Labelling Native Antibodies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A boronic acid based biorthogonal probe in combination with an acyl donor has been introduced that enables site&#8208;specific incorporation of azide group at the Ser and Tyr residues of nonengineered full&#8208;length antibody. Further derivatization of this functional site was accomplished through click reaction, yielding well&#8208;defined immunoconjugates. The generality of this boronate&#8208;affinity method has been demonstrated on a number of monoclonal antibodies, all with different binding specificities. More information can be found in the Research Article by W.&#8208;S. Wayne&#8197;Chang, C.&#8208;C. Lin et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104178).

         <title>Dye Sensitization Offers a Brighter Afterglow Nanoparticle Future for In Vivo Recharged Luminescent Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While concerns about improving recharged afterglow intensity  in vivo  still motivate further exploration, afterglow nanoparticles (AGNP) offer unique optical merit for autofluorescence&#8208;free biological imaging. Apart from efforts enhancing the afterglow emission properties of AGNP, improving afterglow excitation response to visible or near infrared light is important but has lacked success. Dye sensitization has been used to improve the optical response of photovoltaic nanomaterials and to enhance upconversion luminescence efficiency. This concept has recently been expanded and applied to AGNPs. As a new multifunctional nanoprobe, such dye&#8208;sensitized AGNP takes advantage of both high spatial resolution fluorescence imaging and sensitive afterglow imaging. This perspective introduces the background, the concept, mechanism, and related imaging application, as well as existing challenges and proposes future developmental directions for the dye&#8208;sensitized AGNPs.</dc:description>

         <title>Dissolution Behavior and Varied Mesoporosity of Zeolites by NH4F Etching</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the particularities of zeolites dissolution topology, hidden mosaic structures and zeolite microporosity are identified as interlocking factors in shaping the final dissolution behavior of zeolites and the resultant mesoporosity pattern. The size, shape, concentration, and spatial distribution of the mosaic structures predefine the size and morphology of the void space left by dissolution. The dimensions and topology of the micropores determine the dissolution preference towards single framework atoms, interior mosaic blocks, or exterior features of zeolite crystals.







Abstract
The mesopores formation in zeolite crystals has long been considered to occur through the stochastic hydrolysis and removal of framework atoms. Here, we investigate the NH4F etching of representative small, medium, and large pore zeolites and show that the zeolite dissolution behavior, therefore the mesopore formation probability, is dominated by zeolite architecture at both nano&#8208; and sub&#8208;nano scales. At the nano&#8208;scale, the hidden mosaics of zeolite structure predetermine the spatio&#8208;temporal dissolution of the framework, hence the size, shape, location, and orientation of the mesopores. At the sub&#8208;nano scale, the intrinsic micropore size and connectivity jointly determine the diffusivity of reactant and dissolved products. As a result, the dissolution propensity varies from removing small framework fragments to consuming nanodomains and up to full digestion of the outmost part of zeolite crystals. The new knowledge will lead to new understanding of zeolite dissolution behavior and new adapted strategies for tailoring hierarchical zeolites.

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Evaluation of Novel Carbazole&#8208;Derived Photocages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gone in a flash: Two novel photocages, NCARB, and its more water&#8208;soluble analog, NCARB&#8208;DA, have been developed. Both exhibit photophysical properties superior to other o&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;derived photocages and may be used to cage carboxylic acid and phenolic functional groups as exemplified by the use of NCARB&#8208;DA to cage a fluoroquinolone antibiotic and a protected tyrosine residue.







Abstract
We report the design, synthesis and evaluation of two novel photocages, NCARB and isoNCARB, belonging to the o&#8208;nitrobenzyl chemotype and based on the carbazole ring system. The synthesis of each of these isomeric caging molecules was achieved in five steps and in 29&#8201;% overall yield, and their photochemical properties were evaluated using benzoic acid as a model for caging. In the event, upon irradiation at 400&#8197;nm for 60&#8197;min, 82&#8201;% and 42&#8201;% of benzoic acid was freed from the NCARB and isoNCARB photocages, respectively, whereas only 22&#8201;% was released from the nitrodibenzofuran (NDBF) cage. Moreover, the photochemical decaging efficiencies, &#1013;&#934;, of the benzoates photocaged with NCARB and isoNCARB are about 150&#8208; and 20&#8208;fold better, respectively, at 400&#8197;nm than the corresponding caged benzoate derived from NDBF. The water solubility of molecules caged with nitrocarbazole analogs was improved by N&#8208;alkylation of NCARB, the better of the two new photocages, with an aminodicarboxylate group. This modified cage, NCARB&#8208;DA, was exploited in the design of a caged fluoroquinolone antibiotic, the efficacy of which was illustrated in a bacterial growth inhibition assay, and a phenol&#8208;caged tyrosine derivative.

         <title>A Universal DNA Aptamer that Recognizes Spike Proteins of Diverse SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Variants of Concern</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique DNA aptamer, denoted MSA52, displays universally high affinity for the spike proteins of the wild&#8208;type SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 as well as its Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Epsilon, Kappa, Delta and Omicron variants. This aptamer also recognizes pseudotyped lentiviruses expressing eight different spike proteins of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 with very high affinity, exhibiting dissociation constants (Kd) of 20&#8211;50&#8197;pM for these viruses.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Induced Ring Expansion Reactions of Calix[3]pyrrole&#8208;Related Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Growing rings: Calix[n]furan[3&#8208;n]pyrroles (n=0&#8764;3) were synthesized from cyclicoligoketone precursors to investigate strain&#8208;induced macrocyclic ring expansion reactions. As the number of inner NH sites increases, the macrocyclic ring strain increased. Detailed mechanism analysis revealed that calix[6]pyrrole type larger macrocycles were formed through regioselective cleavage and subsequent cyclodimerization of linear intermediates.







Abstract
The recent discovery of calix[3]pyrrole, a porphyrinogen&#8208;like tripyrrolic macrocycle, has provided an unprecedented strain&#8208;induced ring expansion reaction into calix[6]pyrrole. Here, we synthesized calix[n]furan[3&#8208;n]pyrrole (n=1&#8764;3) macrocycles to investigate the reaction scope and mechanism of the ring expansion. Single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis and theoretical calculations revealed that macrocyclic ring strain increases as the number of inner NH sites increases. While calix[1]furan[2]pyrrole exhibited almost quantitative conversion into calix[2]furan[4]pyrrole within 5&#8197;minutes, less&#8208;strained calix[2]furan[1]pyrrole and calix[3]furan were inert. However, N&#8208;methylation of calix[2]furan[1]pyrrole induced a ring&#8208;expansion reaction that enabled the isolation of a linear reaction intermediate. The mechanism analysis revealed that the ring expansion consists of regioselective ring cleavage and subsequent cyclodimerization. This reaction was further utilized for synthesis of calix[6]&#8208;type macrocycles.

         <title>The Apparently Unreactive Substrate Facilitates the Electron Transfer for Dioxygen Activation in Rieske Dioxygenases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quantum chemical study of model complexes finds that reaction energies for the generation of a coordination vacancy at the Fe center of naphthalene dioxygenase through water reorientation and dioxygen binding are insensitive to the presence of naphthalene. The role of the substrate only becomes evident after Rieske cluster oxidation for the 6&#8208;coordinate Fe active site where an additional electron is likely to be first transfered to the naphthalene substrate. These results imply allosteric control of the substrate on Rieske dioxygenase reactivity.







Abstract
Rieske dioxygenases belong to the non&#8208;heme iron family of oxygenases and catalyze important cis&#8208;dihydroxylation as well as O&#8208;/N&#8208;dealkylation and oxidative cyclization reactions for a wide range of substrates. The lack of substrate coordination at the non&#8208;heme ferrous iron center, however, makes it particularly challenging to delineate the role of the substrate for productive 
 activation. Here, we studied the role of the substrate in the key elementary reaction leading to 
 activation from a theoretical perspective by systematically considering (i) the 6&#8208;coordinate to 5&#8208;coordinate conversion of the non&#8208;heme FeII upon abstraction of a water ligand, (ii) binding of 
, and (iii) transfer of an electron from the Rieske cluster. We systematically evaluated the spin&#8208;state&#8208;dependent reaction energies and structural effects at the active site for all combinations of the three elementary processes in the presence and absence of substrate using naphthalene dioxygenase as a prototypical Rieske dioxygenase. We find that reaction energies for the generation of a coordination vacancy at the non&#8208;heme Fe
 center through thermoneutral H2O reorientation and exothermic 
 binding prior to Rieske cluster oxidation are largely insensitive to the presence of naphthalene and do not lead to formation of any of the known reactive Fe&#8208;oxygen species. By contrast, the role of the substrate becomes evident after Rieske cluster oxidation and exclusively for the 6&#8208;coordinate non&#8208;heme Fe
 sites in that the additional electron is found at the substrate instead of at the iron and oxygen atoms. Our results imply an allosteric control of the substrate on Rieske dioxygenase reactivity to happen prior to changes at the non&#8208;heme Fe
 in agreement with a strategy that avoids unproductive 
 activation.

         <title>Topologically&#8208;Interlocked Minicircles as Probes of DNA Topology and DNA&#8208;Protein Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA minicircles exist in biological contexts, such as kinetoplast DNA, and are promising components for creating functional nanodevices. They have been used to mimic the topological features of nucleosomal DNA and to probe DNA&#8208;protein interactions such as HIV&#8208;1 and PFV integrases, and DNA gyrase. Here, we synthesized the topologically&#8208;interlocked minicircle rotaxane and catenane inside a frame&#8208;shaped DNA origami. These minicircles are 183 bp in length, constitute six individual single&#8208;stranded DNAs that are ligated to realize duplex interlocking, and adopt temporary base pairing of single strands for interlocking. To probe the DNA&#8208;protein interactions, restriction reactions were carried out on DNAs with different topologies such as free linear duplex or duplex constrained inside origami and free or topologically&#8208;interlocked minicircles. Except the free linear duplex, all tested structures were resistant to restriction digestion, indicating that the topological features of DNA, such as flexibility, curvature, and groove orientation, play a major role in DNA&#8208;protein interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling Tautomerization in Pyridine&#8208;Fused Phosphorus&#8208;Nitrogen Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inclusion of a second nitrogen atom in the aromatic core of phosphorus&#8208;nitrogen (PN) heterocycles results in unexpected tautomerization to a nonaromatic form. This tautomerization, initially observed in the solid&#8208;state through X&#8208;ray crystallography, is also explained by computational analysis. We prepared an electron deficient analogue (  2e  ) with a fluorine on the pyridine ring and showed that the weakly basic pyridine resisted tautomerization, providing key insights to why the transformation occurs. To study the difference in solution vs. solid&#8208;state heterocycles, alkylated analogues that lock in the quinoidal tautomer were synthesized and their different  1  H NMR and UV&#8208;Vis spectra studied. Ultimately, we determined that all heterocycles are the aromatic tautomer in solution and all but  2e  switch to the quinoidal tautomer in the solid state. Better understanding of this transformation and under what circumstances it occurs suggest future use in a switchable on/off hydrogen&#8208;bond directed receptor that can be tuned for complementary hydrogen&#8208;bonding motif .</dc:description>

This very minor new species  B  c  is based on a different conformer scaffold than the one encountered in the previously reported  B  o  form and, essentially differs from  B  o  by displaying shorter Cu  I  &#8208;Cu  I  intermetallic distances. DFT calculations allow concluding that the predominance in the solid&#8208;state of the weakly luminescent and less stable  B  o  phase is due to the extra stability induced by a larger number of intermolecular non&#8208;covalent &#960;&#8208;CH interactions in its crystalline packing and not by the intrinsic stability of the Cu  I  8  Pd  II  1  dicationic moiety. Calculations also revealed that a more stable conformation  B  calc  is expected in vacuum, which bears a different distribution of Cu  I  &#8208;Cu  I  intermetallic distances than the dications in  B  o  and  B  c  phases. Taking into account that the geometrical alterations are associated to drastic changes of luminescence properties, this confer to the Cu  I  8  Pd  II  1  assembly high potentiality as stimuli&#8208;sensitive luminescent materials. Indeed, by applying mechanical or thermal stress to samples of  B  o  phase, new phases  B  g  and  B  m  , respectively, were obtained. Alterations of the solid&#8208;state photophysical properties of these new species compared to those recorded for  B  o  are reported together with a combined experimental and computed study of the structures/properties relationships observed in these phases.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Introducing the idea of integrated design and cascade activity into nanozyme, the novel integrated nanozymes (INAzymes), FeMo6@Ce&#8208;Uio&#8208;66 (FC&#8208;66(n)), are designed and synthesized by encapsulating iron&#8208;based polyoxometalates (FeMo6) into the ceria&#8208;based metal organic framework (Ce&#8208;Uio&#8208;66). Due to the oxygen&#8208;driven reversible Ce3+/Ce4+  couple sites, the ''Fenton&#8208;like'' effect by iron centers, the ''nanoscale proximity''&#160;effects by nanocages, and their synergistic effects, FC&#8208;66(n) as INAzymes exhibit elegant cascade enzyme&#8208;mimic activities (oxidase&#8208;, peroxidase&#8208;, and Fenton&#8208;like activity). By employing dopamine (DA) detection as a model reaction, a high&#8208;efficient fluorescent "turning&#8208;on&#8208;enhanced" platform under near neutral conditions was established.</dc:description>

         <title>Unexpected acid&#8208;triggered formation of reversibly photoswitchable Stenhouse salts from Donor&#8208;acceptor Stenhouse adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Donor&#8208;acceptor Stenhouse Adducts (DASAs) are reversibly photoswitchable dyes able to interconvert between a red/NIR absorbing triene&#8208;like state and a colorless cyclic state. Although optically attractive for multiple applications, their low solubility and lack of photoswitching in water impede their use in aqueous environments. We developed water&#8208;soluble DASAs based on indoline as donor and methyl, or trifluoromethyl, pyrazolone&#8208;based acceptors. In acetonitrile, photophysical analysis and photochemical studies accounted with a three&#8208;state kinetic model confirmed the reversible photoswitching mechanism previously proposed. In water, the colorless cyclic state is a thermodynamic sink at neutral pHs. In contrast, in acidic conditions, we observed a fast scrambling of DASAs'&#160;end&#8208;group resulting into the in&#8208;situ&#160;formation of Stenhouse salts (StS) which are in turn, capable of reversible photoswitching. We believe that this unexpected result is of interest not only for the future design of DASAs with improved stability, but also for further development and applications of StS as photoswitchable probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Wavelength Orthogonal Photodynamic Networks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability of light to remotely control the properties of soft matter materials in a dynamic fashion has fascinated material scientists and photochemists for decades. However, only recently has our ability to map photochemical reactivity in a finely wavelength resolved fashion allowed for different colors of light to independently control the material properties of polymer networks with high precision, driven by monochromatic irradiation enabling orthogonal reaction control. The current concept article highlights the progress in visible light&#8208;enabled photochemistry and explores how it has enabled the design of polymer networks with dynamically adjustable properties. We will explore current applications ranging from dynamic hydrogel design to the light driven adaptation of 3D printed structures on the macro&#8208; and micro&#8208;scale. While the alternation of mechanical properties via remote control is largely reality for soft matter materials, we herein propose the next frontiers for adaptive properties, including remote switching between conductive and non&#8208;conductive properties, hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces, fluorescent or non&#8208;fluorescent, and cell adhesive vs cell repellent properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Phenylene&#8208;Bridged Perylene Monoimides as Acceptors for Organic Solar Cells &#8211; A Study on the Structure&#8208;Properties Relationship</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors based on perylene monoimides coupled in the peri position through phenylene linkers were synthesized via Suzuki&#8208;coupling reactions. Various substitution patterns were investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations in combination with experimental data to elucidate the geometry and their optical and electrochemical properties. Further investigations of the bulk properties with grazing incidence wide angle X&#8208;ray scattering (GIWAXS) gave insight into the stacking behavior of the acceptor thin films. Electrochemical and morphological properties correlate with the photovoltaic performance of devices with the polymeric donor PBDB&#8208;T and a maximum efficiency of 3.17% was reached. The study gives detailed information about structure&#8208;properties relationships of perylene&#8208;linker&#8208;perylene compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Intramolecular P/Al&#8208;based FLPs via Aluminium&#8208;Tin&#8208;Exchange and their Reactivity toward CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) composed of acidic alane and basic phosphane functions, separated by a xanthene linker, can be prepared through the corresponding Me  3  Sn derivative and methyl aluminum compounds with elimination of Me  4  Sn. This way MeClAl&#8208;, Cl  2  Al&#8208; and (C  6  F  5  )  2  Al&#8208; moieties could be introduced and the resulting FLPs are stabilized by a further equivalent of the alane precursors. In contact with the FLPs CO  2  is bound via the C atom at the phosphane functions and the two O atoms at the Al centers. The residues at the latter determine the binding strength. Hence, in case of MeClAl CO  2  capture occurs at higher pressure and under ambient conditions CO  2  is released again, while for MeClAl and (C  6  F  5  )  2  Al CO  2  binding becomes irreversible. The results of DFT calculations rationalize these findings by the high thermodynamic stabilization in case of more electronegative residues, which concomitantly lead to higher barriers, and in case of (C  6  F  5  )  2  Al further stabilization is achieved through a low reorganization energy.</dc:description>

         <title>Syntheses of Anthracene&#8208;centered Large PAH Diimides and Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) structures with suitable electron&#8208;withdrawing groups are useful building blocks for developing optical and electron&#8208;transporting materials. Here, we report the application of double benzannulation processes to synthesize PAH diimides with enlarged &#960;&#8208;frameworks featuring a central anthracene moiety. The processes are realized by copper&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] cycloaddition of ethynyl&#8208;substituted aromatic dicarobximide to 2,5&#8208;bis(phenylethynyl)terephthalaldehyde, followed by intramolecular photocyclization or direct arylation via Heck cross coupling. Specifically, A central symmetric benzo[1,2&#8208;  k  :4,5&#8208;  k  ']&#8208;bis(fluoranthene)&#8208;3,4,12,13&#8208;tetracarboxyl diimide (BFDI) is acquired, with a single crystal revealing its completely planar polycyclic skeleton. Such a shape&#8208;persistent PAH expectedly exhibits a tendency to stack face&#8208;to&#8208;face and forms J&#8208;aggregates. Moreover, BFDI can be expediently difunctionalized site&#8208;selectively in reactive 9 and 10 positions of the anthracene unit and applied to prepare conjugated polymers. When coupled with 1,4&#8208;diketopyrrolo[3,4&#8208;  c  ]&#8208;pyrrole (DPP) via thiophene and dithiophene linkers, two significantly broadened absorption bands extended to the near&#8208;infrared regime appear, evidencing the effective &#960;&#8208;conjugative extension ability of BFDI unit.</dc:description>

         <title>Dielectric and Magnetic Relaxations Exhibited in a 2D Parallel Interpenetrating Frustrated Star Net</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using organic ammonium HDMPDA (DMPDA=N, N&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;propanediamine) with a positive charge, a complex [HDMPDA][Fe6(&#956;3&#8208;O)2(&#956;&#8208;O2CH)15] (1) with a 2D parallel interpenetrating &#8220;star&#8221; net was successfully obtained. The complex exhibits properties as a frustrated material with TN=4.2&#8197;K, and also presents new functions with dielectric and slow magnetic relaxations.







Abstract
Constructing multiple functional geometric frustration magnets is a hot topic in solid state chemistry and material science. Herein, a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) parallel interpenetrating &#8220;star&#8221; net complex [HDMPDA][Fe6(&#956;3&#8208;O)2(&#956;&#8208;O2CH)15] (1) was obtained successfully with HDMPDA (DMPDA=N, N&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;propanediamine) as charge balancer. The dipole reorientation of the rotator [HDMPDA]+ in the complex brings a structure transition which leads dielectric relaxation close to room temperature. Despite strong antiferromagnetic coupling existing between ions in the net, long&#8208;range order temperature TN of the complex is suppressed to 4.2&#8197;K by geometric frustration. Interestingly, below TN, a canted antiferromagnetic state, accompanied with slow magnetic relaxation, is detected due to the lack of enough magnetic coupling between 2D layers. Thus, 1 is a particular multifunctional magnetic frustration material containing two different types of relaxations.

         <title>Parasitic Light Absorption, Rate Laws and Heterojunctions in the Photocatalytic Oxidation of Arsenic(III) Using Composite TiO2/Fe2O3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanisms that control the kinetics of arsenic(III) photocatalytic oxidation when meso&#8208;TiO2 is coupled with an Fe2O3 adsorbent phase are investigated herein. Parasitic light absorption is the primary factor, followed by changes in rate law (from disguised zero&#8208;order to first order). Charge transfer across the heterojunction in our material is negligible.







Abstract
Composite photocatalyst&#8208;adsorbents such as TiO2/Fe2O3 are promising materials for the one&#8208;step treatment of arsenite contaminated water. However, no previous study has investigated how coupling TiO2 with Fe2O3 influences the photocatalytic oxidation of arsenic(III). Herein, we develop new hybrid experiment/modelling approaches to study light absorption, charge carrier behaviour and changes in the rate law of the TiO2/Fe2O3 system, using UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS), and kinetic analysis. Whilst coupling TiO2 with Fe2O3 improves total arsenic removal by adsorption, oxidation rates significantly decrease (up to a factor of 60), primarily due to the parasitic absorption of light by Fe2O3 (88&#8201;% of photons at 368&#8197;nm) and secondly due to changes in the rate law from disguised zero&#8208;order kinetics to first&#8208;order kinetics. Charge transfer across this TiO2&#8208;Fe2O3 heterojunction is not observed. Our study demonstrates the first application of a multi&#8208;adsorbate surface complexation model (SCM) towards describing As(III) oxidation kinetics which, unlike Langmuir&#8208;Hinshelwood kinetics, includes the competitive adsorption of As(V). We further highlight the importance of parasitic light absorption and catalyst fouling when designing heterogeneous photocatalysts for As(III) remediation.

         <title>Dye&#8208;Conjugated Spinach RNA by Genetic Alphabet Expansion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light emission by dye&#8208;conjugated Spinach RNA transcripts can be generated by genetic alphabet expansion. Dye&#8208;conjugated unnatural base substrates are site&#8208;specifically incorporated into Spinach RNA opposite to its unnatural base pairing partner in DNA templates by T7 transcription. The dye&#8208;conjugated Spinach RNAs or shorter versions robustly emit fluorescence.







Abstract
Light&#8208;emitting systems using an RNA aptamer&#8208;dye pair, such as Spinach RNA, are an attractive method for imaging and tracing RNA expression in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. We present an alternative Spinach method by genetic alphabet expansion using an unnatural base pair system, in which a dye&#8208;conjugated unnatural base substrate is site&#8208;specifically incorporated at a specific position in Spinach RNA by transcription involving the third base pair. The incorporation position was predicted by molecular dynamics simulations. This dye&#8208;conjugated Spinach RNA increased the thermal stability of the fluorescence, the robustness against ion sensitivity, and the resistance against photobleaching. Furthermore, we applied our method to Baby Spinach, a shorter version of Spinach, for dye conjugation toward the visible detection of transcripts. This is the first demonstration of an alternative RNA imaging method for a detection system using genetic alphabet expansion.

         <title>Disordered Low Molecular Weight Spiropyran Exhibiting Photoregulated Adhesion Ability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoresponsive adhesives are attractive functional materials. Differentiating from the reported azobenzene&#8208;containing adhesives with photoswitched adhesion&#8208;on or off property, a low molecular weight spiropyran that could exhibit photoregulated adhesion ability in multiple levels is disclosed in this work. In disordered solid state, the reported spiropyran could also gain photochromism with five different color states, which show one&#8208;to&#8208;one correspondence to the adhesion ability. This work provides a new strategy for developing functional materials by employing low molecular weight compounds.







Abstract
The functions of the materials composed of small molecules are highly dependent on their ordered molecular arrangements in both natural and artificial systems. Without ordered structure, small molecules hardly gain complicated functions, due to the absence of intermolecular covalent bond connection or strong network. Here, a low molecular weight spiropyran that could exhibit attractive photochromism and powerful adhesion property in disordered solid state is demonstrated. With maximum up to &#8764;8&#8197;MPa, the adhesion strength could be photoregulated in multiple levels, which also shows one&#8208;to&#8208;one correspondence to the specific color state. The working mechanism analysis on the photoregulated adhesion reveals that the isomer ratio of merocyanine form and the molecular packing density of spiropyran are the determining factors for the adhesion ability. The discovery of photoregulated adhesion from pure spiropyran provides a new strategy for developing functional materials by employing low molecular weight compounds.

         <title>Direct Crystallization of Diamine Radical Cations: Carbon&#8208;Nitrogen Bond Formation from the Reaction of Triphenylamine with TiCl4, TiBr4, or SnCl4 versus Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Formation with SbCl5**
</title>

         <dc:description>
The direct synthesis of diamine radical cations in crystalline form produced through oxidation of triphenylamine followed by the formation of either a C&#8722;N or a C&#8208;C bond is reported. Although the oxidative coupling of triphenylamine is well studied, diamine products are rarely captured in their radical cation state. The neutral diamine most frequently obtained from this reaction pathway is N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetraphenylbenzidine. Herein, the capture of radical cations of diamines in crystalline form in one step starting with neutral triphenylamine was demonstrated, and the formation of two products (the radical cations of N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzenediamine or N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tetraphenylbenzidine) depending on the oxidizing agent used was observed.

         <title>Prelithiation Reagents and Strategies on High Energy Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategy of prelithiation is an effective pathway to supply Li source for compensating the lithium loss in the first cycle, thus promoting the energy density of batteries. This review outlines the chemical and electrochemical prelithiation methods for anodes and cathodes, with particularly discussion on the complexity of different prelithiation reagents/strategies and corresponding lithiation degree reached.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) have been widely employed in energy&#8208;storage applications owing to the relatively higher energy density and longer cycling life. However, they still need further improvement especially on the energy density to satisfy the increasing demands on the market. In this respect, the irreversible capacity loss (ICL) in the initial cycle is a critical challenge due to the lithium loss during the formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the anode surface. The strategy of prelithiation was then proposed to compensate for the ICL in the anode and recover the energy density. Here, various methods of the prelithiation are summarized and classified according to the basic working mechanism. Further, considering the critical importance and promising progress of prelithiation in both fundamental research and real applications, this Review article is intended to discuss the considerations involved in the selection of prelithiation reagents/strategies and the electrochemical performance in full&#8208;cells. Moreover, insights are provided regarding the practical application prospects and the challenges that still need to be addressed.

         <title>Tuning Diradical Properties of Boron&#8208;Containing &#960;&#8208;Systems by Structural Isomerism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A boron&#8208;containing polycyclic hydrocarbon was synthesized via the precise borylation of the &#946;&#8208;carbons of indeno[1,2&#8208;b]fluorene. Because of the efficient conjugation between the boron atoms and &#960;&#8208;skeleton, this molecule exhibits downshifted energy levels, blue&#8208;shifted light absorption, smaller diradical character and weak paramagnetic resonance in comparison to its isomeric molecule, thus demonstrating the significant electronic effects of structural isomerism on diradical properties.







Abstract
Tuning diradical character is an important topic for organic diradicaloids. Herein, we report the precise borylation enabling structural isomerism as an effective strategy to modulate diradical character and thereby properties of organic diradicaloids. We synthesized a new B&#8208;containing polycyclic hydrocarbon that has the indeno[1,2&#8208;b]fluorene &#960;&#8208;skeleton with the &#946;&#8208;carbons bonding to two boron atoms. Detailed theoretical and experimental results show that this bonding pattern leads to its distinctive electronic structures and properties in comparison to that of its isomeric molecule. This molecule has the efficient conjugation between boron atoms and &#960;&#8208;skeleton, resulting in downshifted LUMO and HOMO levels. Moreover, it exhibits smaller diradical character and thereby inhibited diradical properties, such as significantly blue&#8208;shifted light absorption, larger energy bandgap and weak para&#8208;magnetic resonance. Notably, this B&#8208;containing polycyclic hydrocarbon possesses much stronger Lewis acidity and its Lewis acid&#8208;base adducts display enhanced diradical character, demonstrating the positive effects of Lewis coordination on modulating diradical performance.

         <title>Role of Anionic Backbone in NHC&#8208;Stabilized Coinage Metal Complexes: New Precursors for Atomic Layer Deposition
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of new N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) based Cu(I) and Ag(I) complexes were synthesized, analyzed, and evaluated for their potential usage in atomic layer deposition (ALD) of coinage metal thin films. Employing the same set of diketonate&#8208;type ligands for both metals did result in thermally stable Cu(I) complexes suitable for ALD, while the Ag(I) complexes exhibit an inherently unstable nature and different bonding features. More information can be found in the Research Article by Anjana Devi et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103798).

         <title>N&#8208;Terminal Selective C&#8722;H Azidation of Proline&#8208;Containing Peptides: a Platform for Late&#8208;Stage Diversification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selective C&#8722;H azidation of up to 6 amino acids long proline&#8208;containing peptides is reported. In each example, the N&#8208;terminal residue was selectively functionalized even in presence of amino acids bearing tertiary aliphatic, benzylic and &#945; to heteroatoms C&#8722;H bonds. The azidated products were used in cycloaddition reactions and as masked imines for new C&#8722;C bond formations, allowing an easy access to diversified peptide scaffolds.







Abstract
A methodology for the C&#8722;H azidation of N&#8208;terminal proline&#8208;containing peptides was developed employing only commercially available reagents. Peptides bearing a broad range of functionalities and containing up to 6 amino acids were selectively azidated at the carbamate&#8208;protected N&#8208;terminal residue in presence of the numerous other functional groups present on the molecules. Post&#8208;functionalizations of the obtained aminal compounds were achieved: cycloaddition reactions or C&#8722;C bond formations via a sequence of imine formation/nucleophilic addition were performed, offering an easy access to diversified peptides.

         <title>Cellular Detection of a Mitochondria Targeted Brominated Vinyl Triphenylamine Optical Probe (TP&#8722;Br) by X&#8208;Ray Fluorescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed and synthesized a new bimodal vinyltriphenylamine probe. TP&#8722;Br is an off&#8208;on fluorescent probe that targets mitochondria thanks to its lipophilic cationic structure. The probe was imaged by two modalities in cells: by one&#8208;photon or two&#8208;photon excitation fluorescence microscopy and by Scanning Synchrotron Radiation X&#8208;ray Fluorescence.







Abstract
Triphenylamine (TP) derivatives such as two&#8208;branch cationic vinylbenzimidazolium triphenylamine TP&#8722;2Bzim are promising turn&#8208;on fluorescent probes suitable for two&#8208;photon imaging, labelling mitochondria in live cells. Here, we designed two TP&#8722;2Bzim derivatives as bimodal probes suitable for X&#8208;ray fluorescence imaging. The conjugation of the TP core with a rhenium tricarbonyl moiety in the TP&#8722;RePyta probe altered the localisation in live cells from mitochondria to lysosomes. The introduction of bromine on the TP core generated the TP&#8722;Br probe retaining good photophysical properties and mitochondria labelling in live cells. The influence of calcium channels in the uptake of TP&#8722;Br was studied. Synchrotron Radiation X&#8208;ray Fluorescence (SXRF) imaging of bromine enabled the detection of TP&#8722;Br and suggested a negligible presence of the probe in an unbound state in the incubated cells, a crucial point in the development of these probes. This study paves the way towards the development of TP probes as specific organelle stainers suitable for SXRF imaging.

         <title>Efficient Photocatalytic Carbonyl Alkylative Amination Enabled by Titanium&#8208;Dioxide&#8208;Mediated Decarboxylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient nano TiO2&#8208;mediated carbonyl alkylative amination that proceeds by heterogeneous photoredox catalysis is reported. The use of nano titanium dioxide as photocatalyst allows efficient synthesis of diverse amines in good to excellent yields. Mechanistic studies reveal a single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer mechanism involving the photoexcitation of TiO2 to generate alkyl radicals from carboxylic acids decarboxylation.







Abstract
Herein, a heterogeneous carbonyl alkylative amination reaction that proceeds by photoredox catalysis has been developed. The use of nano titanium dioxide (TiO2, 25&#8197;nm) as photocatalyst allows efficient synthesis of diverse amines in good to excellent yields. Mechanistic studies reveal a single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer mechanism involving the photoexcitation of TiO2 to generate alkyl radicals from carboxylic acids decarboxylation. This protocol highlights the utility of using heterogeneous semiconductor photocatalysts to promote a practical and general synthesis of complex amines from readily available feedstocks.

         <title>Induced Near&#8208;Infrared Emission and Controlled Photooxidation based on Sulfonated Crown Ether in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;soluble sulfonated crown ether makes very strong host&#8208;guest encapsulation with a set of push&#8208;pull&#8208;type dyes, which can greatly enhance the fluorescence emission from visible to near&#8208;infrared regions and significantly suppress the 1O2 generation and concomitant photooxidation ability of photosensitizers in aqueous media.







Abstract
Regulation of physio&#8208;chemical properties and reaction activities via noncovalent methodology has become one of increasingly significant topics in supramolecular chemistry and showed inventive applications in miscellaneous fields. Herein, we demonstrate that sulfonated crown ether can form very stable host&#8208;guest complexes with a series of push&#8208;pull&#8208;type photosensitizers, eventually leading to the dramatic fluorescence enhancement in visible and near&#8208;infrared regions. Meanwhile, severe suppression in singlet oxygen (1O2) production is found, mainly due to the higher energy barriers between the excited single and triple states upon host&#8208;guest complexation. Moreover, such complexation&#8208;induced tuneable 1O2 generation systems has been utilized in adjusting the photochemical oxidation reactions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (anthracene) and sulfides ((methylthio)benzene) in water. This supramolecularly controlled photooxidation based on the selective molecular binding of crown ether with photosensitizers may provide a feasible and applicable strategy for monitoring and modulating many photocatalysis processes in aqueous phase.

A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced three&#8208;component sulfonyl&#8208;heteroarylation of vinyl ethers with sulfinates and five&#8208;membered heteroaryl chlorides is reported. This protocol proceeds via a photoinduced electron transfer process of electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor complex between sulfinates and heteroaryl chlorides, enabling facile excess to &#946;&#8208;sulfonyl and &#946;&#8208;fluoromethyl &#945;&#8208;oxy alkyl heteroaromatics under mild and catalyst&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
We report a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced three&#8208;component sulfonyl&#8208;heteroarylation of vinyl ethers with sulfinates and five&#8208;membered heteroaryl chlorides. This protocol proceeds via electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes between sulfinates and heteroaryl chlorides, giving &#946;&#8208;sulfonyl alkyl five&#8208;membered heteroarenes with high efficiency and excellent regioselectivity under mild and catalyst&#8208;free conditions. Utilization of CF3SO2Na or CF2HSO2Na as coupling partners further achieves three&#8208;component fluoromethyl&#8208;arylation of vinyl ethers, furnishing a series of valuable CF3/CF2H&#8208;incorporated alkyl heterocycles under mild conditions.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Heterocyclic Chloroamines and Aziridines by Enantioselective Protonation of Catalytically Generated Enamines**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis enables the synthesis of chiral vicinal chloroamines via asymmetric protonation of catalytically generated prochiral chloroenamines. The process is highly enantioselective, with the origin of asymmetry and catalyst substituent effects elucidated by DFT calculations. The method allows access to rare heterocycle&#8208;substituted vicinal chloroamines, aziridines, and vicinal diamines.







Abstract
We report a method for the synthesis of chiral vicinal chloroamines via asymmetric protonation of catalytically generated prochiral chloroenamines using chiral Br&#248;nsted acids. The process is highly enantioselective, with the origin of asymmetry and catalyst substituent effects elucidated by DFT calculations. We show the utility of the method as an approach to the synthesis of a broad range of heterocycle&#8208;substituted aziridines by treatment of the chloroamines with base in a one&#8208;pot process, as well as the utility of the process to allow access to vicinal diamines.

         <title>Sequential Visible Light&#8208;Induced Reactions Using Different Photocatalysts: Transformation of Furans into 2&#8208;Pyridones via &#947;&#8208;Lactams Using a New Ring Expansion Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic ring expansion reaction that transforms &#947;&#8208;lactams into 2&#8208;pyridones has been developed. This expansion was incorporated into a multi&#8208;photocatalyst one pot process that starts from readily accessible furans and uses two metal&#8208;free photocatalysts (methylene blue and eosin). The photocatalytic cleavage of C&#8722;I bonds activated by an electron donor at the neighbouring carbon is achieved, using eosin as photocatalyst.







Abstract
A new photocatalytic ring expansion reaction that transforms &#947;&#8208;lactams into 2&#8208;pyridones is described. The reaction is radical&#8208;triggered and was inspired by a late&#8208;stage oxidation commonly observed in fungal metabolism. The reaction is particularly powerful because it can be included in a one pot process which converts readily accessible furans directly into 2&#8208;pyridones through sequential photo&#8208;induced reactions (energy transfer and electron transfer). The study also unveiled unprecedented reactivity for the mild and metal&#8208;free photocatalyst eosin, wherein it is used to cleave a C&#8722;I bond activated only by an electron donor on the neighbouring carbon.

         <title>Developing Flexible Quinacridone&#8208;Derivatives&#8208;Based Photothermal Evaporaters for Solar Steam and Thermoelectric Power Generation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic molecule (DCN&#8722;4CQA) with the absorbance region at 300&#8211;800&#8197;nm and photothermal conversion efficiency of 18.2&#8201;% under one sun was employed for fabricating flexible photothermal evaporators for solar steam and thermoelectric power generation.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven interfacial vaporization by localizing solar&#8208;thermal energy conversion to the air&#8722;water interface has attracted tremendous attention. In the process of converting solar energy into heat energy, photothermal materials play an essential role. Herein, a flexible solar&#8208;thermal material di&#8208;cyan substituted 5,12&#8208;dibutylquinacridone (DCN&#8722;4CQA)@Paper was developed by coating photothermal quinacridone derivatives on the cellulose paper. The DCN&#8722;4CQA@Paper combines desired chemical and physical properties, broadband light&#8208;absorbing, and shape&#8208;conforming abilities that render efficient photothermic vaporization. Notably, synergetic coupling of solar&#8208;steam and solar&#8208;electricity technologies by integrating DCN&#8722;4CQA@Paper and the thermoelectric devices is realized without trade&#8208;offs, highlighting the practical consideration toward more impactful solar heat exploitation. Such solar distillation and low&#8208;grade heat&#8208;to&#8208;electricity generation functions can provide potential opportunities for fresh water and electricity supply in off&#8208;grid or remote areas.

         <title>Stereochemical Behavior of Pairs of P&#8208;stereogenic Phosphanyl Groups at the Dimethylxanthene Backbone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pair of vinyl phosphanyl substituents at the dimethylxanthene backbone undergoes a rather rapid epimerization reaction with a DFT calculated meso to rac isomerization barrier of ca. 22&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. The low inversion barrier at phosphorus is likely due to a &#960;&#8208;conjugative effect. The addition of the strong Lewis acid B(C6F5)3 to the P&#8208;stereogenic phosphane probably proceeds through a reactive phospha&#8208;iminium intermediate with loss of the stereochemical information.







Abstract
The P&#8208;stereogenic bis(phosphanes) 7 and 9, featuring pairs of P(Mes)&#8208;ethynyl or vinyl substituents at the dimethyl xanthene backbone show rather low barriers of stereochemical inversion at phosphorus. &#960;&#8208;Conjugative effects are probably causing these low inversion barriers. Compound 7 reacted with B(C6F5)3 to form the nine&#8208;membered heterocyclic product 10, featuring a [P]&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;B(C6F5)3 substituent. Compound 7 was converted to the bis[P(Mes)vinyl] xanthene derivative 9, which gave the zwitterionic P(H)(Mes)&#8722;CH=CH&#8722;B(C6F5)3 containing product 16 upon treatment with B(C6F5)3. Thermally induced epimerization barriers at phosphorus of ca. 20 to 27&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 were calculated by DFT for the alkenyl&#8208; and alkynyl&#8208;P derived systems 6 to 9, 15 and 16 and experimentally determined for the examples 7 and 16.

         <title>Cross&#8208;talk Between (Hydrogen)Sulfite and Metalloproteins: Impact on Human Health</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic effect of sulfite and metalloproteins is a significant correlation with human health. The role and fate of sulfite is discussed in different perspectives &#8208; as a toxic substance, its biochemical transformation by two key enzymes, sulfite oxidase (sulfite&#8208;to&#8208;sulfate) and sulfite reductase (sulfite&#8208;to&#8208;sulfide), formation of sulfite radical by heme proteins (peroxidases) and neutralization of toxic sulfite radicals by globins.







Abstract
Sulfite is a potent toxic substance causing harm to multi&#8208;organ in human. Despite toxicity, it is widely used as preservative, anti&#8208;browning and anti&#8208;oxidant in foods, beverages, and pharmaceuticals, which cause easy admission of sulfite in human. Sulfite is also produced endogenously during the catabolism of cysteine and methionine. In vivo, the serum sulfite level at physiological range is strictly maintained by a molybdenum dependent sulfite oxidase (SO), which catalyzes sulfite to sulfate oxidation via a two&#8208;electron oxidation pathway. The loss of SO activity causes high serum sulfite level that fosters several diseases, including asthma, neurological dysfunction, birth defects, and heart diseases. The cytotoxicity of (bi)sulfite is implicated as sulfite radicals, which are generated by mainly heme&#8208;peroxidases via a one&#8208;electron oxidation pathway. On the other hand, the toxic sulfite radicals are neutralized to sulfite by heme&#8208;globins.

     alt="Cross-talk Between (Hydrogen)Sulfite and Metalloproteins: Impact on Human Health"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Synergistic effect of&lt;/b&gt; sulfite and metalloproteins is a significant correlation with human health. The role and fate of sulfite is discussed in different perspectives - as a toxic substance, its biochemical transformation by two key enzymes, sulfite oxidase (sulfite-to-sulfate) and sulfite reductase (sulfite-to-sulfide), formation of sulfite radical by heme proteins (peroxidases) and neutralization of toxic sulfite radicals by globins.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sulfite is a potent toxic substance causing harm to multi-organ in human. Despite toxicity, it is widely used as preservative, anti-browning and anti-oxidant in foods, beverages, and pharmaceuticals, which cause easy admission of sulfite in human. Sulfite is also produced endogenously during the catabolism of cysteine and methionine. In vivo, the serum sulfite level at physiological range is strictly maintained by a molybdenum dependent sulfite oxidase (SO), which catalyzes sulfite to sulfate oxidation via a two-electron oxidation pathway. The loss of SO activity causes high serum sulfite level that fosters several diseases, including asthma, neurological dysfunction, birth defects, and heart diseases. The cytotoxicity of (bi)sulfite is implicated as sulfite radicals, which are generated by mainly heme-peroxidases via a one-electron oxidation pathway. On the other hand, the toxic sulfite radicals are neutralized to sulfite by heme-globins. The enzymatic reduction of sulfite to sulfide is catalyzed by sulfite reductase, which contains an unusual metal cofactor, siroheme-[4Fe4S]-cluster. Overall, the interaction of sulfite with various metalloproteins in&#8197;vivo is a close relation with human health. Therefore, this review describes the metabolic conversion of (bi)sulfite to sulfate, sulfite radical or sulfide via oxidation or reduction pathways by various metalloproteins (specially SOs, peroxidases, heme-globins, and sulfite reductases), and the potential applications of sulfite in biosensors/biofuel cells, anti-browning, and advance oxidation process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The &#8722;CN behind the mask: Continuous&#8208;flow methodology for versatile cyanide&#8208;free cyanation of C(sp2) and C(sp) carbons has been developed by in&#8197;situ generating a novel oxazole based (5&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;phenyloxazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl) boronic acid [OxBA] reagent as a non&#8208;toxic carbon&#8208;bound masked &#8722;CN source. The four&#8208;step flow sequence consisting of lithiation/borylation, Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling and [4+2]/retro&#8208;[4+2] produced medicinally important benzonitrile analogues with good to excellent yields.







Abstract
This work reports a cyanide&#8208;free continuous&#8208;flow process for cyanation of sp2 and sp carbons to synthesize aryl, vinyl and acetylenic nitriles from (5&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;phenyloxazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl) boronic acid [OxBA] reagent as a sole source of carbon&#8208;bound masked &#8722;CN source. Non&#8208;toxic and stable OxBA reagent is generated by lithiation&#8208;borylation of bromo&#8208;oxazole, and the consecutive Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling with aryl, vinyl, or acetylenic halides and demasking [4+2]/retro&#8208;[4+2] sequence were successfully accomplished to give the desired cyano compounds with reasonably good yields in a four&#8208;step flow manner. A unique feature of this cyanation protocol in flow enables to cyanate a variety of sp2 and sp carbons to produce a broad spectrum of aryl acetonitrile. It is envisaged that the OxBA based cyanation would replace existing unstable and toxic approaches as well as non&#8208;toxic cyanation using two different sources of &#8220;C&#8221; and &#8220;N&#8221; to incorporate the &#8722;CN group.
