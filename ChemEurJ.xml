         <title>A Hybrid BN&#8208;Doped Nanographene with Narrow Emission Bandwidths for OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computational screening, synthesis and characterization identified BN&#8208;containing candidate 1 as a promising narrow bandwidth chromophore. BN doped nanographene exhibits blue fluorescence at 441&#8197;nm with an extraordinarily narrow fluorescence peak with full width at half maximum (FWHM)=10&#8211;11&#8197;nm that outperforms narrow bandwidths of the incumbent references. Utility of the compound for long lifetime narrow bandwidth OLEDs has also been demonstrated







Abstract
We describe synthesis of BN&#8208;doped nanographene containing five phenylene units, boron and nitrogen atoms with alternating ortho&#8208;disposition, as well as direct B&#8722;N connections. Resulting BN doped nanographene exhibits blue fluorescence at 441&#8197;nm with an extraordinarily narrow fluorescence peak with a full width at half maximum (FWHM)=10&#8211;11&#8197;nm. Crystallography reveals supramolecular organization of this compound in the crystal phase. Initial organic light emitting device (OLED) data suggest that the presence of a directly connected B&#8722;N isostere can lead to devices with sufficiently long lifetime as well as narrow emission electro&#8208;luminescence peaks necessary for OLED applications.

         <title>Oligoethylene Phosphoramidate&#8208;Based Kinase Inhibitor Prodrugs &#8211; Solubility, Enzyme Inhibition, and Hydrolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinase inhibitors are functionalized with oligoethylene glycol chains via a pH&#8208;labile linker, improving water solubility (optimal at n=3 &#8211; 4) while retaining enzyme inhibition and hydrolysis properties. This study highlights the impact of chain length on solubility, providing a versatile strategy for designing kinase inhibitor prodrugs.







Abstract
The efficiency of kinase inhibiting cancer therapeutics is often limited by their poor solubility in water. PEGylation is one possible strategy to improve the solubility of the drug, however, means to cleave off the PEG after reaching the target is important to make use of the therapeutic effects of the native drug. Moreover, the length of the PEG chains will have an effect on the solubility and binding. In this study, we want to extend our understanding of solubilizing oligo ethylene glycol (OEG) chains connected to kinase inhibitors using a pH labile phosphoramidate linker. We synthesize a library of drug&#8208;OEG conjugates for Ceritinib, Crizotinib, Palbociclib, and Ribocilib kinase inhibitors with n=2, 3, 4 and 8 OEG repeat units. We study the influence on water solubility, enzyme inhibition, and pH induced hydrolysis. A maximum in solubility is obtained for n=3 or 4. We show that small differences in chain length can strongly influence the water solubility, while all other properties remain relatively comparable.

         <title>Synthesis of a Transient Cationic Phosphaborene and its Trapping by Facile Aliphatic C&#8722;H Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstraction of bromide from a B&#8208;brominated phosphaborene stabilized by a cyclic alkylamino carbene results in the formation of a transient cationic phosphaborene, which undergoes intramolecular C&#8722;H activation to yield a phosphinoborenium cation. DFT calculations reveal a barrier of only 8&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for this transformation, emphasizing the high reactivity of cationic phosphaborenes







Abstract
The synthesis of a transient cationic phosphaborene [(Mes*)P=B(CAAC)]+ (Mes*=2,4,6,&#8211;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl, CAAC=cyclic alkylamino carbene) by halide abstraction from the B&#8208;brominated analogue is reported. This species was found to undergo rapid and selective intramolecular aliphatic C&#8722;H bond activation to yield a phosphinoborenium cation, which undergoes facile deprotonation to give a cyclic base&#8208;stabilized phosphaborene. Computational investigation of the mechanism of C&#8722;H activation indicates a boron&#8208;centred activation route with an exceptionally low barrier of 8&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, followed by a nearly barrierless hydride migration from boron to phosphorus. This underscores the enhanced reactivity of phosphaborenes compared to their lighter iminoborane analogues and indicates that steric stabilization alone is likely insufficient to isolate persistent cationic phosphaborenes, necessitating the use of alternative design strategies.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to Long&#8208;Chain Hydrocarbons: Investigating the asymmetric C&#8208;C Coupling Mechanism on Pd3Au Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to high&#8208;energy&#8208;density hydrocarbons is pivotal for addressing energy and environmental challenges. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the conversion of CO2 to long&#8208;chain hydrocarbons is both crucial and complex. In this study, we employed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the C&#8208;C coupling mechanisms responsible for the formation of C2&#8208;C4 products on Pd3Au catalysts. Our findings highlight the sequential formation of C2&#8208;C1 bonds via asymmetric C&#8208;C coupling as a critical pathway for generating C3 product, which is essential for controlling product selectivity. Detailed analysis of coupling reactions involving CCH2* and CCH3* intermediates with various C1 species indicates that these asymmetric coupling events are energetically favorable and play a decisive role in the selective assembly of carbon atoms into longer hydrocarbon chains. Moreover, we propose a mechanism wherein the asymmetric coupling of C1&#8208;C3 intermediate leads to a diverse array of C4 products. This process underscores the importance of CH2 group coupling with C3 intermediates in forming long&#8208;chain hydrocarbons. Our work provides valuable insights into optimizing catalyst design for improved selectivity towards higher hydrocarbons in CO2 reduction processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of pH&#8208;Responsive SA/PEGDA/AS&#8208;POSS Hydrogels via Michael Addition for Controlled Drug Release and Enhanced Mechanical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, thiolated sodium alginate (SA) and hydrophilic, polymerizable Janus&#8208;type polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (AS&#8208;POSS) are&#160;synthesized by introducing thiol and sulfonic acid groups, respectively.&#160;A series of pH&#8208;responsive SA/PEGDA/AS&#8208;POSS nanocomposite hydrogels are&#160;successfully prepared through Michael addition reactions between the thiol groups of thiolated sodium alginate and the double bonds in the molecular chains of AS&#8208;POSS and poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA).&#160;This&#160;reaction proceeds rapidly under&#160;physiological conditions&#160;without requiring initiators or catalysts.&#160;As the content of AS&#8208;POSS increases, the pore size within the hydrogel decreases, and the network structure becomes denser, with significant improvements in mechanical properties. The hydrogel exhibits excellent pH sensitivity, showing lower swelling in acidic media compared to neutral media, and undergoing hydrolysis and losing stability in alkaline media. Moreover, the incorporation of AS&#8208;POSS significantly enhances the drug&#8208;loading capacity (85.7%) and encapsulation efficiency (72.1%) of doxorubicin (DOX). The drug is released faster in weakly acidic environments, with a cumulative release rate reaching 80.4%, demonstrating excellent targeting and controlled release properties. Cytotoxicity tests show that the SA/PEGDA/AS&#8208;POSS hydrogel has good biocompatibility and exhibits effective tumor&#8208;killing ability, indicating its great potential as a drug carrier with promising applications in biomedical materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the Synthesis and Properties of Fluorinated Cationic Triangulenes and their Precursors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorination of tris(2,6&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl)&#8208;methylium ((DMP)3C+) was achieved through the partial defluorination of the methyl 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorobenzoate via nucleophilic aromatic substitution. Using the fluorinated 2F((DMP)3C+) as a precursor, fluorinated tetramethoxy&#8208; and dimethoxyquin&#8208; acridinium salts (2F4 and 2F5 respectively) and trioxo&#8208;, azadioxo&#8208;, and diazaoxo&#8208; triangulenium salts (2F6, 2F7 and 2F8 respectively) were synthesized successfully in good to moderate yields. Fluorination induced significant red shifts in absorption (16 to 29 nm) and emission (13 to 41 nm) maxima, and increased electrophilicity as evidenced by lower reduction potentials. X&#8208;ray structural analysis showed distinct packing patterns compared to the non&#8208;fluorinated analogues, indicating the presence of molecular dipoles</dc:description>

         <title>EXPLORING SINGLE ATOM SUBSTITUTION IN PHENANTHRO[9,10&#8208;D]IMIDAZOLE &#8208;BASED D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A ARCHITECTURES WITH FLUORENE AND ITS HETEROANALOGS FOR NON&#8208;VOLATILE RESISTIVE WORM MEMORY DEVICE APPLICATIONS</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A compounds, with fluorene and its heteroanalogs (carbazole, dibenzofuran, dibenzothiophene) as the donor units and phenanthroimidazole as the acceptor, were designed and synthesized for non&#8208;volatile memory device applications. The effect of single&#8208;atom substitution on memory behavior was examined through optical, electrochemical, and computational studies. The photophysical studies confirm a significant intramolecular charge transfer from the donor to the acceptor unit, and the electrochemical analysis shows an irreversible anodic peak (0.99&#8208;1.21 V) with an optimal band gap ranging from 2.80 to 2.88 eV. All the compounds exhibited non&#8208;volatile binary WORM memory behaviour with an ON/OFF current ratio of 105 and 103. The devices also showed excellent stability over 100 cycles and maintained a retention time of 4000 s. Notably, the compound with carbazole substitution displayed a lower threshold voltage and a higher ON/OFF current ratio of 105. Density functional theory calculations confirmed that the combined effects of charge transfer and charge trapping mechanisms are crucial to the resistive switching mechanisms observed. This work highlights the potential of single atom substitution in D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A systems, providing valuable insights for designing high&#8208;performance data storage devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;assembly of Antisense DNA&#8208;Camptothecin Amphiphile into Glutathione&#8208;Responsive Nanoparticles for Combination Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent years have witnessed the rapid growth of combination therapy for the treatment of cancer. Chemo and antisense DNA therapies are two clinically proven and efficient treatment modalities for cancer. However, direct delivery of both chemo and antisense oligonucleotides into the cancerous cells is challenging and hence there is a high demand for the development of new strategies that permit the direct delivery of chemo and antisense therapeutic agents in a targeted fashion. Herein, we show a supramolecular approach for the direct delivery of hydrophobic chemo drug and cell impermeable antisense oligonucleotide into a cancer cell in a targeted fashion. Synthesis of an amphiphile (DNA1&#8208;CPT) consist of hydrophobic camptothecin (CPT) conjugated to an antisense oligonucleotide (DNA1) via glutathione&#8208;responsive disulphide linker is reported. Self&#8208;assembly of DNA1&#8208;CPT results in the formation of GSH&#8208;responsive NPs with CPT as the hydrophobic core and DNA1 as the hydrophilic shell. Self&#8208;assembled NPs exhibits excellent cellular internalization via endocytosis pathway, and the high concentration of glutathione inside the cancer cells causes the cleavage of disulphide bond of the NPs and trigger the simultaneous release of CPT and DNA1a. Enhanced cytotoxicity is observed for the NPs due to the synergetic combination of chemo and antisense DNA therapies.</dc:description>

         <title>pH&#8208;Controlled DNA Switching Circuits with Multi&#8208;State Responsiveness for Logic Computation and Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic control of DNA circuit functionality is essential for constructing chemical reaction networks (CRNs) that implement complex functions. The triplex has been utilized for dynamically regulating the diverse functionalities of DNA circuits due to its distinctive pH responsiveness. However, it is challenging for triplexes to independently regulate the functionality of DNA circuits, as various triplexes were often required for DNA circuits to function in complex environments, which adds complexity to the design and control of dynamic circuits. Here, we proposed a pH&#8208;controlled multi&#8208;state DNA switching circuit construction strategy to realize dynamic regulation among three states through conformational transitions of the triplex. In addition, by leveraging the regulatory role of multi&#8208;state DNA switching circuits on the toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement reaction, we constructed switchable DNA circuits for logic computation and control of hybridization chain reaction (HCR). We confirmed that the designed DNA switching circuits exhibited multi&#8208;state responsiveness, allowing for different logical operations at varying pH levels and programmable control of the diverse reaction pathways in the HCR. Our strategy offers a convenient approach for the intelligent response and dynamic regulation of large&#8208;scale CRNs and DNA nanostructure self&#8208;assembly. It promises applications in biosensing, disease detection and drug delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Apoptosis of Cancer Cells Induced by a Kinase&#8208;Responsive Peptide Amphiphile</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organelle targeting is a useful approach in drug development for cancer therapy. Peptide amphiphiles are good candidates for targeting specific organelles because they can be engineered into a wide range of molecular structures, enabling customization for specific functional needs. We have developed a peptide amphiphile, C16&#8208;(EY)3, that can respond to tyrosine kinase activity and undergo phosphorylation inside cancer cells. C16&#8208;(EY)3 selectively induced apoptosis in cancer cells that overexpressed tyrosine kinase. The peptide amphiphile self&#8208;assembled into nanofibers on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, reducing the ER membrane fluidity and triggering ER stress. The mechanism of the cancer cell death induced by C16&#8208;(EY)3 was shown to involve phosphorylation by tyrosine kinase, ER stress induction, and the subsequent activation of caspase&#8208;4, &#8208;12, and &#8208;9, which ultimately triggered apoptosis through the activation of caspase&#8208;3 and &#8208;7. In vivo studies further validated the antitumor efficacy of C16&#8208;(EY)3 as transcutaneous administration of the peptide amphiphile inhibited tumor growth in mice. This study elucidated the mechanism of apoptosis induced by the peptide amphiphile, indicating the potential of peptide amphiphiles as organelle&#8208;targeting cancer therapeutics and providing a novel strategy for the development of selective and potent anticancer drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of a Non&#8208;Heme &#956;&#8208;Oxodicobalt(IV) Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of a CoIII complex of an N2O2 set of donor ligand assists the formation of an &#956;&#8208;oxodicobalt(IV) species, which was found stable at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. The intermediate species works as an oxidant for the C&#8722;H atom abstraction and oxygen atom transfer reactions.







Abstract
A mononuclear CoIII complex (1) of a bisamide&#8208;bisalkoxide donor ligand was synthesized and thoroughly characterized. The reaction of 1 with 0.5&#8197;equiv. of m&#8208;chloroperbenzoic acid (m&#8208;CPBA) in acetonitrile at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C resulted in the formation of a &#956;&#8208;oxodicobalt(IV) complex (2), which was characterized by an array of spectroscopic techniques, including X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy which revealed a short Co&#8722;Ooxo distance of 1.67&#8197;&#197;. Reactivity studies of 2 towards oxidation/oxygenation of hydrocarbon C&#8722;H bond and triphenylphosphine or thioanisole derivatives have been examined. UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy studies showed the appearance of clear isosbestic points during the oxidation of substrates together with a neat transformation of 2 to 1. Detailed kinetic investigations established that 2 follows a Concerted Proton&#8208;Electron Transfer (CPET) mechanism for hydrocarbon oxidation and has a weak electrophilic character. Catalytic behavior of 1 was noted towards the oxygen atom transfer reactions. This study showcases the spectroscopic investigation and reactivity studies of a CoIV(&#956;&#8208;O)CoIV moiety. Although the FeIV analog of such a core has been described before, the study describes the first example with a CoIV center.

         <title>Supramolecular Preorganization of Amine&#8208;functionalized Diacetylene Monomers in their Crystals Allows their Topochemical Polymerization to Polydiacetylenes Capable of CO2 Capture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized three different diacetylenes from ethynyl&#8208;anilines and the N&#8722;H&#8230;N hydrogen bonding in their crystals preorganized them for topochemical polymerization. Heat induced topochemical polymerization yielded three amino&#8208;functionalized PDAs, which were found to be mesoporous. These polymers exhibited CO2 physisorption as a function of their porosity.







Abstract
We designed and synthesized three diacetylene monomers M1&#8208;M3 having two NH2 groups. As anticipated, the NH2 groups aided the preorganization of these monomers by N&#8722;H&#8230;N hydrogen bonding. In the crystals of monomer M1 and M2, the intermolecular N&#8722;H&#8230;N hydrogen bonding preorganized the diyne units in an orientation suitable for their topochemical polymerization, but in the case of monomer M3, the distance was slightly larger than that recommended for the topochemical reaction. However, upon heating, all the three monomers underwent topochemical polymerization to yield polydiacetylenes P1&#8208;P3 respectively. All three polymers have been characterized using PXRD, Raman, MALDI&#8208;TOF and solid&#8208;state UV spectroscopy. Furthermore, we investigated the abilities of these amine&#8208;functionalized polymers to capture CO2 gas. Polymer P1, which had a larger surface area, demonstrated the highest CO2 adsorption capacity of 1.28&#8197;mmol g&#8722;1 at 273&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar, compared to the other two polymers.

         <title>Helical Supramolecular Polymers Formed via Head&#8208;to&#8208;Tail Host&#8208;Guest Complexation of Chiral Bisporphyrin Monomers with Trinitrofluorenone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intermolecular host&#8208;guest complexation of a bisporphyrin&#8208;TNF head&#8208;to&#8208;tail monomer possessing a chiral binaphthyl linker was employed to construct helically twisted supramolecular polymers. Atomic force microscopy revealed well&#8208;defined right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed helical morphologies, with the helicity governed by the axial chirality of the binaphthyl linker.







Abstract
The intermolecular host&#8208;guest complexation of head&#8208;to&#8208;tail monomers consisting of cleft&#8208;shaped bisporphyrin and trinitrofluorenone units connected by a chiral binaphthyl linker was employed to construct helically twisted supramolecular polymers. Results from 1H NMR, diffusion&#8208;ordered NMR spectroscopy, and viscometry experiments revealed that the supramolecular polymerization of these monomers follows a ring&#8208;chain competition mechanism. The introduction of bulky substituents at the linker significantly suppressed the formation of macrocyclic oligomers, whereas smaller alkyl chains facilitated the formation of the cyclic form. The chirally twisted structures of the supramolecular polymers were confirmed using circular dichroism spectroscopy. Atomic force microscopy revealed that the (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;configurations of the binaphthyl linkers induced right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed helical structures, respectively, in the supramolecular polymer chains. The absence of cooperativity in the supramolecular copolymerization of (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;1&#8201;a resulted in the formation of stereo&#8208;random supramolecular copolymers.

         <title>Upgrade of Weak &#963;&#8208;Hole Bond Donors via Cr(CO)3 Complexation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystallographic studies and theoretical calculation prove that the &#951;6&#8208;coordination of the neutral Cr(CO)3 moiety by arenes is a general approach for activating the &#963;&#8208;hole donor ability of heteroatoms appended to the arene.







Abstract
Molecular recognition mediated by &#963;&#8208;hole interactions is enhanced as the electrostatic potential at the &#963;&#8208;hole becomes increasingly positive. Traditional methods to strengthen &#963;&#8208;hole donor ability of atoms such as halogens often involve covalent modifications, such as, introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents (neutral or positively charged) or electrochemical oxidation. Metal coordination, a relatively underexplored approach, offers a promising alternative. In this study, &#951;6&#8208;coordination of Cr(CO)3 to haloarenes, a neutral system, is demonstrated to significantly increase the electrophilic character of halogen bond donors, enabling weak donors such as chloroanisole to form short and directional Cl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O halogen bonds. Structural characterization using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and computational analysis of a series of &#951;6&#8208;Cr(CO)3&#8208;coordinated haloarenes provides evidence for this enhancement. Furthermore, the effect is shown to extend to other heteroatomic substituents on the coordinated arene, e.&#8201;g., other halogen atoms as well as elements of groups 16, 15, and 14 of the periodic table, broadening the scope of this approach.

         <title>Comparative Study of Iminodibenzyl and Diphenylamine Derivatives as Hole Transport Materials in Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces novel fluorene&#8208;based hole transport materials (HTMs) for perovskite solar cells (PSCs), integrating iminodibenzyl and diphenylamine moieties. These materials exhibit remarkable photostability, optical, and thermal properties. Among them, TDF&#8208;2 achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.38&#8201;%. The findings highlight iminodibenzyl's potential to address stability and cost challenges, paving the way for next&#8208;generation HTMs in PSCs.







Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have recently achieved over 26&#8201;% power conversion efficiency, challenging the dominance of silicon&#8208;based alternatives. This progress is significantly driven by innovations in hole transport materials (HTMs), which notably influence the efficiency and stability of PSCs. However, conventional organic HTMs like Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD and PTAA, although highly efficient, suffer from thermal degradation, moisture ingress, and high cost. This study explores the potential of iminodibenzyl, a moiety known for its strong electron&#8208;donating capabilities in pharmaceutical applications, as a novel HTM. A series of fluorene&#8208;based derivatives incorporating iminodibenzyl (TMF&#8208;2 and TDF&#8208;2) and diphenylamine (TMF&#8208;1 and TDF&#8208;1) units were synthesized and characterized. The new HTMs demonstrated commendable optical, electrochemical, and thermal properties, as well as enhanced photostability. Among them, TDF&#8208;2 achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.38&#8201;%, the highest of the new materials. Although these efficiencies are slightly lower than the benchmark PTAA (20.20&#8201;%), the study underscores the potential of iminodibenzyl to enhance photostability and increase HOMO levels, making it a promising candidate for future HTM development in PSCs.

These materials exhibit remarkable photostability, optical, and thermal properties. Among them, TDF-2 achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.38&#8201;%. The findings highlight iminodibenzyl's potential to address stability and cost challenges, paving the way for next-generation HTMs in PSCs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have recently achieved over 26&#8201;% power conversion efficiency, challenging the dominance of silicon-based alternatives. This progress is significantly driven by innovations in hole transport materials (HTMs), which notably influence the efficiency and stability of PSCs. However, conventional organic HTMs like Spiro-OMeTAD and PTAA, although highly efficient, suffer from thermal degradation, moisture ingress, and high cost. This study explores the potential of iminodibenzyl, a moiety known for its strong electron-donating capabilities in pharmaceutical applications, as a novel HTM. A series of fluorene-based derivatives incorporating iminodibenzyl (&lt;b&gt;TMF-2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;TDF-2&lt;/b&gt;) and diphenylamine (&lt;b&gt;TMF-1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;TDF-1&lt;/b&gt;) units were synthesized and characterized. The new HTMs demonstrated commendable optical, electrochemical, and thermal properties, as well as enhanced photostability. Among them, &lt;b&gt;TDF-2&lt;/b&gt; achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.38&#8201;%, the highest of the new materials. Although these efficiencies are slightly lower than the benchmark PTAA (20.20&#8201;%), the study underscores the potential of iminodibenzyl to enhance photostability and increase HOMO levels, making it a promising candidate for future HTM development in PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phosphorus&#8208;Nitrogen Heterocycles Derived from Chelating N&#8208;Donor Ligands: Historical Advances, Recent Highlights, and Outlook</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemistry of PN heterocycles is underexplored relative to systems based on main group atoms such as boron. However, strategies for their production have been developed. As a result, the application of PN heterocycles as functional molecular materials, in small molecule activation chemistry and catalysis, and bioimaging and therapeutics have emerged. Seminal examples, recent highlights, and future opportunities are discussed.







Abstract
The exploration of phosphorus&#8208;nitrogen heterocycles derived from chelating N&#8208;donor ligands is an area of research that has lagged behind the development of similar heterocycles based on other main group elements, most notably boron. The fact that phosphorus and nitrogen are both group 15 elements and that their compounds are most commonly viewed as Lewis bases likely contributes to this observation. However, through judicious ligand design and creative use of phosphorus sources that render phosphorus as Lewis acidic and/or electron poor, a variety of heterocyclic architectures are possible. In this article, we highlight selected examples of phosphorus adducts of bidentate, tridentate, and tetradentate N&#8208;donor ligands that have shown utility as functional molecular materials, in small molecule activation and catalysis, and as therapeutics and diagnostics in chemical biology. Finally, we look forward to the future of this emerging area and provide commentary on the unique opportunities available to researchers working within the field of phosphorus&#8208;nitrogen heterocycle chemistry.

         <title>Carborane&#8208;Decorated Siloles with Highly Efficient Solid&#8208;State Emissions &#8211; What Drives the Photophysical Properties?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two aggregation&#8208;induced emission&#8208;active units were combined to create new hybrids. The photophysical behaviour is dominated by the silole unit, while the solid&#8208;state emission can be tailored via the supramolecular structure influenced by the carborane moiety.







Abstract
New hybrids were synthesised by linking carboranes and siloles, both of which are known as aggregation&#8208;induced emission active units. Although most of the newly synthesised systems do not display notable quantum yield either in solution or in the aggregated state, they emit strongly in the solid&#8208;state, and a quantum yield of up to 100&#8201;% can be achieved. The tailorable quantum yield can be attributed to the packing of the molecules in the crystal lattice ruled by the carborane and phenyl moieties according to the SC&#8208;XRD data. Our experimental results, complemented by density functional theory calculations, show that the silole moiety primarily influences the photophysical properties. At the same time, the carborane serves as a steric building block without direct responsibility for the aggregation&#8208;induced emission property. The patterns of substituents can alter the absorption and emission properties.

         <title>Fisetin as a Blueprint for Senotherapeutic Agents &#8211; Elucidating Geroprotective and Senolytic Properties with Molecular Modeling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exceptional senotherapeutic activity of fisetin, combining both geroprotective and senolytic effects, was validated using computational chemistry tools, establishing it as a cornerstone template for the development of novel agents.







Abstract
Targeting senescent cells and the factors that accelerate this pathological state has recently emerged as a novel field in medicinal chemistry. As attention shifts to synthetic substances, studies on natural agents are often overlooked. In this paper, we present a detailed computational modeling study that encompasses quantum mechanics and molecular dynamics to elucidate the senotherapeutic activity of fisetin, a natural flavonoid. The mitochondrial environment, serving as a proxy for senescence, received special attention. Throughout the study, fisetin's outstanding geroprotective properties&#8208;exhibiting significant potential against &#8901;OOH, O2&#8901;&#8722;, and &#8901;OH radicals, surpassing those of Trolox or ascorbate&#8208;were identified. Furthermore, fisetin demonstrated a high capacity to restore oxidatively damaged biomolecules to their pristine forms, thereby renewing the functionality of proteins and amino acids. The senolytic properties were examined in terms of Bcl&#8208;2 and Bcl&#8208;xL inhibition. The results indicated that fisetin not only binds effectively to these proteins but also, with appropriate modifications, may exhibit specific selectivity toward either target. This study highlights fisetin's remarkable activity in these areas and provides a molecular description of the underlying processes, paving the way for future research.

         <title>Characterization of the Titanium(III) Tris(alkyl) Ti{CH(SiMe3)2}3 and its Conversion to a Dimeric Alkyl&#8208;Bridged Titanium(IV) Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The trigonal pyramidal titanium(III) trialkyl is synthesized in moderate, reproducible yield via the reaction of three equivalents of Li{CH(SiMe3)2} with TiCl3(NMe3)2 in hexanes. The use of the latter solvent is a key feature for the success of the synthetic route. Ti{CH(SiMe3)2}3 is characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, EPR and electronic spectroscopy.







Abstract
The reaction of three equivalents of LiCH(SiMe3)2 with TiCl3(NMe3)2 afforded the rare homoleptic Ti(III) alkyl Ti{CH(SiMe3)2}3 (1) which crystallized as blue needles in 32&#8201;% yield. Single crystal X&#8208;Ray data for 1 showed a trigonal pyramidal coordination geometry around titanium, which could be ascribed to weak interactions between the C&#8722;H bonds and the Ti(III) atom based on computational results. X&#8208;band EPR spectroscopy gives spectral parameters consistent with the proposed Ti(III) formulation. Solutions of 1 are unstable at room temperature owing to intramolecular C&#8722;H activation that gave a dimeric Ti(IV) complex [{(Me3Si)2HC}Ti{&#956;&#8208;CHSiMe2CHSiMe3}]2 (2).

         <title>Chlorination&#8208;Supported Shrinkage of C60 Fullerene to Non&#8208;classical C58 Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dedicated to the memory of Prof. S. I. Troyanov.Carbon cage shrinkage of C60 to C58 was achieved via high&#8208;temperature chlorination with SbCl5/SbCl3 mixture. Two HPLC isolated and structurally characterized compounds, C58(NC1)Cl20 and C58(NC1)Cl24, contain one heptagon, two fused pentagon pairs, one pentagon triple, and one pentagon quartet in their non&#8208;classical carbon cages. Pathways of chlorination promoted skeletal cage transformations via C2 loss and Stone&#8208;Wales rearrangements are discussed in detail.







Abstract
We provide important novel insights into skeletal transformations of fullerene by reporting new cases of cage shrinkage in the most abundant C60 fullerene via a C2 loss. High&#8208;temperature (400&#8211;500&#8201;&#176;C) chlorination of IPR C60 with SbCl5 or SbCl5/SbCl3 mixtures predominantly gives non&#8208;IPR C60Cln compounds via Stone&#8208;Wales rearrangements, but the present study further reveals non&#8208;classical C58Cln chlorofullerenes as by&#8208;products. The new C58(NC1)Cl20 and C58(NC1)Cl24 chlorides have been isolated by air&#8208;free HPLC and structurally characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Their non&#8208;classical carbon cages feature one heptagon, two pairs of fused pentagons, one triple&#8208;pentagon junction, and one quartet of sequentially fused pentagons. However, the chlorination patterns and molecular shapes of C58(NC1)Cl20 and C58(NC1)Cl24 are essentially different. We propose the likely multistep transformation pathways toward the new compounds and further report the chlorination&#8208;promoted formation of chlorofullerenes with still smaller fullerene cages.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dedicated to the memory of Prof. S. I. Troyanov&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;b&gt;Carbon cage shrinkage of C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; to C&lt;sub&gt;58&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; was achieved via high-temperature chlorination with SbCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;/SbCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; mixture. Two HPLC isolated and structurally characterized compounds, C&lt;sub&gt;58&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;NC&lt;/i&gt;1)Cl&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;58&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;NC&lt;/i&gt;1)Cl&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;, contain one heptagon, two fused pentagon pairs, one pentagon triple, and one pentagon quartet in their non-classical carbon cages. Pathways of chlorination promoted skeletal cage transformations via C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; loss and Stone-Wales rearrangements are discussed in detail.

         <title>An Intelligent Electrochemical Multi&#8208;Enzyme Molecular Machine for Chiral Chemical</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces the concept of an intelligent multi&#8208;enzyme molecular machine that integrates electrochemical strategies and enzymatic cascades with real&#8208;time monitoring and control. This system features a modular design and high biotransformation efficiency, streamlining complex synthesis processes and enabling automated, eco&#8208;friendly manufacturing without intermediate steps.







Abstract
In vitro multi&#8208;enzyme synthesis pathways harness the core elements of cellular synthesis while simplifying the complexities of cellular processes, facilitating the production of high&#8208;value chemicals. However, these in&#8197;vitro synthesis processes often operate like a &#8220;black box&#8221; with limited monitoring of each reaction step, leading to a low substrate conversion efficiency. In this study, we present an intelligent multi&#8208;enzyme molecular machine(iMEMM) as a model system for achieving the deracemization of D, L&#8208;phosphinothricin (D, L&#8208;PPT). The entire system leverages electrochemical power and enzyme&#8208;catalyzed (cascade) reactions to establish substrate channel and enhance efficiency. By modularizing each reaction step and using electrochemical real&#8208;time monitoring of the reaction process, a single&#8208;step electrobiotransformation efficiency of up to 98&#8201;% and a chiral target L&#8208;PPT synthesis efficiency exceeding 99&#8201;% have been achieved. This iMEMM eliminates the need for intermediate separation, enabling a &#8220;substrate in, product out&#8221; process. Our research paves the way for future green, intelligent, and automated biological manufacturing.

         <title>Organoselenium Ligand Enabled Selective Electron Tuning for Switchable Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report the nickel selenoether electrocatalysts which show tunable reaction centers (nickel or ligand) for HER using mild weak acetic acid in DMF solvent. Synthesized nickel selenoether electrocatalysts (2) follow a ligand&#8208;centered pathway demonstrating remarkably high turnover frequency (kobs) up to 14000&#8197;s&#8722;1 with 93&#8201;% Faradaic Efficiency (F.E.). Whereas nickel electrocatalysts (1; having N&#8208;donor ligands with selenoether ligands) follow a metal&#8208;centered HER and show a kobs value of 2110&#8197;s&#8722;1 with F.E. of 98&#8201;%.







Abstract
Unraveling the electronic structure of metal complexes can bring various catalytic possibilities for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, the electronic effect of metal and ligands modulating and switching the reaction center for HER has yet to be comprehensively analyzed. Herein, we report nickel selenoether electrocatalysts which show tunable reaction centers (nickel or ligand) for HER using mild weak acetic acid in less deprotonating DMF solvent. Synthesized nickel selenoether electrocatalysts which follow a ligand&#8208;centered pathway demonstrated remarkably high turnover frequency (kobs) upto 14000&#8197;s&#8722;1 with 93&#8201;% Faradaic Efficiency (F.E.). Whereas Ni&#8208;electrocatalyst having N&#8208;donor and selenoether ligands follow a metal&#8208;centered HER and show kobs value of 2110&#8197;s&#8722;1 with F.E. of 98&#8201;%. A kinetic isotopic effect (KIE) study using CD3CO2D provides kH/kD=0.49 and 13.01 values for two types of catalysts suggestive of metal&#8208;centered and ligand&#8208;centered catalytic behavior, respectively. Also, EPR studies revealed nickel&#8208;centered and ligand&#8208;centered radicals in two types of Ni&#8208;electrocatalysts. Mechanistically, the EPR, CV, and DFT computation studies suggest that the electron density of the selenoether ligand plays a crucial role by acting as an electron reservoir in deciding the reaction pathways, whether hydride formation occurs at metal&#8208;centered leading to Ni&#8722;H intermediate or ligand&#8208;centered pathways for HER.

An efficient I2&#8208;promoted Povarov reaction procedure for the synthesis of N&#8208;heteroaromatic benzothiazole and 2, 2&#8242;&#8208;biquinolines was disclosed. This protocol was characterized by broad substrate scope (49 examples, 31&#8211;80&#8201;% yields), large&#8208;scale synthesis, and product downstream derivatization. Based on the rotatable C&#8722;C bond of such bisheterocyclic compounds, compound 4a was successfully developed as a viscosity probe.







Abstract
A straightforward I2&#8208;promoted Povarov multicomponent reaction strategy for the synthesis of N&#8208;heteroaromatic benzothiazoles and 2, 2&#8242;&#8208;biquinolines was described. This methodology involved a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step procedure, tandem iodination/Kornblum oxidation, and [4+2] condensation. This protocol was characterized by broad scope of substrates (49 examples, 31&#8211;80&#8201;% yields), applicable for large&#8208;scale preparation, and downstream derivatization of the products. Photophysical property of the two classes of bisheteroaryl compounds was investigated. Based on the rotatable C&#8722;C bond, 2&#8208;(6&#8208;methylquinolin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzo[d]thiazole (4&#8201;a) was successfully developed as a viscosity probe, which opened up new hopes and prospects for biomedical applications.

         <title>Molecular Structural Control of the Amorphous&#8208;Crystalline Balance in Solids: Structure&#8208;Phase Correlation in DADQs with Enhanced/Switchable Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fundamental correlation of the molecular/supramolecular structural factors that promote amorphous, crystalline and bi&#8208;stable states in molecular solids is derived through spectroscopic investigations, crystallographic analysis and thermal studies of a family of molecular solids based on alkoxyalkyl substituted diaminodicyanoquinodimethanes exhibiting strong and switchable fluorescence. The correlation is used to predict and demonstrate a new functional molecular phase change material.







Abstract
The amorphous/crystalline (A/C) assembly in molecular solids has a direct bearing on their attributes and applications, including mechanical, pharmaceutical, electronic and photophysical.

     alt="Molecular Structural Control of the Amorphous-Crystalline Balance in Solids: Structure-Phase Correlation in DADQs with Enhanced/Switchable Fluorescence"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fundamental correlation of the molecular/supramolecular structural factors that promote amorphous, crystalline and bi-stable states in molecular solids is derived through spectroscopic investigations, crystallographic analysis and thermal studies of a family of molecular solids based on alkoxyalkyl substituted diaminodicyanoquinodimethanes exhibiting strong and switchable fluorescence. The correlation is used to predict and demonstrate a new functional molecular phase change material.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amorphous/crystalline (&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;/&lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;) assembly in molecular solids has a direct bearing on their attributes and applications, including mechanical, pharmaceutical, electronic and photophysical. A systematic analysis of the molecular features and interactions that determine the predilection towards the &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt; or bi-stable &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt; states is critical. This fundamental problem is addressed through an exhaustive investigation of a large family of alkoxyalkyl diaminodicyanoquinodimethanes (ROR&#8242;-DADQs); enhancement of their fluorescence from the solution, to the &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;, to the &lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt; state serves as an excellent signature of the phase preference and temporal stability. Their thermal characteristics and single crystal structure investigations coupled with Hirshfeld surface analysis of the intermolecular interactions, not only confirm the spectroscopic observations, but also reveal the significant impact of the molecular structural features, key interactions like H-bonds, and molecular orientations in the lattice, on the phase stability.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Frustrated Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin&#8208;frustrated metal&#8208;organic frameworks are an emerging class of materials due to their unique magnetic properties arising from the interplay between geometric and topological factors within the frameworks. This review highlights the fundamental aspects of spin frustration in metal&#8208;organic frameworks, synthetic protocols, structural characteristics, and potential applications.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a fascinating class of structured materials with diverse functionality originating from their distinctive physicochemical properties. This review focuses on the specific chemical design of geometrically frustrated MOFs along with the origin of the intriguing magnetic properties. We have discussed the arrangement of spin centres (metal and ligand) which are responsible for the unusual magnetic phenomena in MOFs. Both two&#8208;dimensional (2D) and three&#8208;dimensional (3D) MOFs with frustrated magnetism, their synthetic routes, and evaluation of magnetic properties are highlighted. Such spin&#8208;frustrated MOFs may find applications in the field of memory devices, transistors, sensors, and the development of unconventional superconductors.

         <title>Interpenetration Control in Metal&#8211;Organic Polyrotaxanes via Solvent Composition and Ligand Steric&#8208;Modulation: Supramolecular Isomerism and Luminescence Detection toward Fe3+ Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Control over interpenetration: Fine&#8208;tuning the solvent compositions and ligand steric&#8208;modulation have controlled the degrees of interpenetration and the formation of a pair of supramolecular isomers possessing 2&#8208;fold 2D &#8594;2D and 4&#8208;fold 2D &#8594;3D polyrotaxane entanglements.







Abstract
Three fluorescent Zn coordaintion polymers (CPs) have been synthesized from the reactions of Zn(NO3)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6H2O, benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (1,4&#8208;H2bdc), and angular carbazole&#8208;derived bispyridyl ligands (Cz&#8208;3,6&#8208;bpy or Cz&#8722;Pr&#8208;3,6&#8208;bpy). CPs 1&#8211;3 all adopt similar two&#8208;dimensional (2D) ring&#8208;and&#8208;rod layer structures, described as topologically 4&#8208;connected 2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;65 nets where the Zn(II) centers act as 4&#8208;connected nodes. CPs 1 and 2 are a pair of solvent&#8208;mediated supramolecular isomers where the former shows a two&#8208;fold interlocked 2D &#8594;2D polyrotaxane&#8208;like entangled net and the latter reveals a four&#8208;fold interpenetrated 2D &#8594;3D polyrotaxane entanglement. CP 3 is structure analgue of 1. The formation of 1&#8211;3 implies the realization of interpenetration control and supramolecular isomerism in polyrotaxanes by fine&#8208;tuning the solvent compositions and ligand steric&#8208;modulation. CPs 1&#8211;3 all show high thermal stability approaching 400&#8201;&#176;C and good chemical stability in various solvents at room temperature for 24&#8197;h. Further, CPs 1&#8211;3 all are excellent turn&#8208;off sensors to recognize Fe3+ in water with high selectivity and sensitivity, great anti&#8208;inference ability, and low limit of detection (LOD). The sensing mechanisms are found to be competitive absorption of excitation wavelength energy and the occurrence of framework&#8211;Fe3+ interactions.

         <title>Near&#8208;neutral pH sensing by azoheteroarene dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We serendipitously discovered a novel series of azoheteroarene dyes capable of detecting pH variations in near&#8208;neutral solutions. These dyes feature thiazole, thiadiazole, triazole, pyrazole, or benzothiazole heteroaryls linked to hydroxyphenyl azo groups. They exhibit distinctive light absorption properties in aqueous solutions and show notable color changes in a narrow pH range, visible to the naked eye. Both experimental data and quantum calculations suggest a plausible mechanism for their function as pH indicators. Additionally, these azoheteroarene dyes effectively monitor pH in complex environments, and we show their use for detecting the pH change of culture medium containing growing cancer cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Triphenylamine Derived Photosensitizers for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution from Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of new (donor)&#8322;&#8208;donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (D2&#8208;D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) and (acceptor)&#8322;&#8208;donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (A2&#8208;D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) organic photosensitizers based on the framework of (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;cyano&#8208;3&#8208;(5&#8208;(4&#8208;(diphenylamino)phenyl)thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)acrylic acid have been synthesized and characterized. By incorporating groups with different electron&#8208;donating or withdrawing abilities, such as dibenzothiophene (DBT), dibenzofuran (DBF), and triazine (TA), into the triphenylamine segment, their photophysical properties have been regulated. &#160;Theoretical calculations were used to explore how various donor&#8208;acceptor combinations influence their hydrogen production performance. Notably, DBF&#8208;CN achieved the highest turnover number (TON) of 10,202 and an initial turnover frequency (TOFi) of 151.6 h&#8315;&#185; under green light irradiation, with an initial activity (Activityi) of 113,532 &#956;mol g&#8315;&#185; h&#8315;&#185; and an apparent quantum yield (AQYi) of 0.76%. This dye&#8208;sensitized&#8208;TiO2&#8208;Pt system is recognized as one of the most efficient and durable systems for photocatalytic hydrogen production under green light irradiation, as described in the literature, when compared using TOF and TON values. Experimental results indicate that the D2&#8208;D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A system significantly enhances photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) performance more effectively than the A2&#8208;D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A system, while also maintaining stability under prolonged light exposure.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Reduction of Carbon Monoxide with Magnesium Alkyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Research on CO activation and homologation is pivotal for promoting sustainable chemistry and the construction of Cn molecular blocks. This work reports the nickel&#8208;catalyzed reduction of CO by magnesium alkyl compounds utilizing a bimetallic Mg/Ni synergistic strategy. The exposure of &#946;&#8208;diketiminato ligand&#8208;supported magnesium monoalkyl compounds LMgR (L = [(DippNCMe)2CH]&#8722;, Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; R = nBu, CH3, C5H9) to 1 bar of CO in the presence of 10 mol% Ni(COD)2 (COD: 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene) selectively afforded the CO single&#8208;insertion product [LMg(CHO)C5H8], the dimerization product [(LMg)2(&#956;&#8208;C2O2)(CH3)2], and the linear trimerization product [(LMg)2(&#956;&#8208;C3O3)(nBu)2], respectively, depending on the R group. In addition, transition metal&#8208;stabilized carbene species resulted from CO activation were successfully isolated through stoichiometric control experiments. The profiles of CO trimerization and dimerization were further elucidated by density functional theory calculations, which confirmed the crucial roles of Mg/Ni cooperation and carbene species in the current reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Balances as Physical Organic Chemistry Tools to Quantify Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review aims to be a comprehensive, authoritative, and critical overview of the recent progress made in the use of molecular balances (MBs) to quantify non&#8208;covalent interactions such as the well&#8208;known &#960;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#960;, CH&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#960;, halogen&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#960;, heteroatom&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#960; interactions but also, the most recent fullerene&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#960;, chalcogen&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;chalcogen, and solvophobic interactions, highlighting limitations, advantages, and similarities under various experimental conditions.







Abstract
Non&#8208;covalent interactions are present in numerous synthetic and biological systems, playing an essential role in vital life processes, such as the stabilization of proteins&#8217; structures or reversible binding in substrate&#8208;receptor complexes. Their study is relevant but faces challenges due to its inherent weak nature. In this context, molecular balances (MBs) are one of the most efficient physical organic chemistry tools to quantify non&#8208;covalent interactions, bringing beneficial knowledge regarding their nature and strength. Herein, we report an overview and critical discussion of recent studies related to various MBs in the quantification of a collection of non&#8208;covalent interactions, covering from the well&#8208;known aryl&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;aryl and CH&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;aryl interaction to the newest fullerene&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;aryl and chalcogen&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;chalcogen interactions.

         <title>Me2Se and Me2Te: Their Structures and Synergistic Effects of Halogen/Chalcogen Bonding with C6F5Br and C6F5I</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
150&#8201;and 125&#8201;years after their first mention, the solid state structures of dimethyl selenide and telluride are reported. They are dominated by chalcogen bonding. Their combination with C6F5Br and C6F5I as halogen bond donors leads to different types of aggregates and extraordinarily short I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te bonding interactions. The analysis of occurrence, strength and directionality of intermolecular forces helps to understand the rules behind cocrystals formation.







Abstract
This work combines halogen and chalcogen bonding. Short, polarity directed C&#8722;X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ch (X=Br or I, Ch=Se or Te) contacts were prepared by in&#8197;situ low&#8208;temperature cocrystallization of liquid mixtures of neutral pentafluorohalogenobenzenes C6F5X and dimethyl chalcogenides Me2Ch. Solid&#8208;state structures of Me2Se and Me2Te were determined 150 and 125&#8197;years after their first description. Significant C&#8722;Ch&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ch contacts make Me2Se dimeric and Me2Te polymeric. The cocrystals comprise C6F5X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Me2Ch&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;XC6F5 aggregates, except the combination X/Ch=I/Te which shows polymeric C6F5I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Me2Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;TeMe2&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;IC6F5 aggregation. The observed C&#8722;X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te interactions are the shortest of this type, and the C&#8722;I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ch contacts are shorter than the corresponding C&#8722;Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ch interactions. Heteromolecular C&#8722;X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ch contacts are accompanied by F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H/F and X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H contacts in the cocrystals. The analysis of packing and contacts in all (co)crystals was complemented by computational studies. They both show that short interactions can be designed and engineered with reasonable predictability.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several &#945;&#8208;diimine stabilized Ni(0) complexes are active precursors for in&#8197;situ catalyst formation, with particular applicability to high&#8208;throughput experimentation. These compounds are easily prepared and solution stable, and function well in several cross&#8208;coupling reactions.







Abstract
We report the synthesis, characterization, and catalytic applications of N,N&#8217;&#8208;diaryl diazabutadiene (DAB) Ni(0) complexes stabilized by alkene ligands. These complexes are soluble and stable in several organic solvents, making them ideal candidates for in&#8197;situ catalyst formation during high&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE). We used HTE to evaluate these Ni(0) precatalysts in a variety of Suzuki and C&#8722;N coupling reactions, and they were found to have equal or better performance than the still&#8208;standard Ni(0) source, Ni(COD)2.

         <title>A Simple and Efficient Stereoselective Synthesis of a 2,3&#8208;Difluorosialic Acid&#8208;Based Influenza Virus Neuraminidase Inhibitor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new simple approach for the exquisitely stereo&#8208;controlled introduction of the C&#8208;3 equatorial fluorine on neuraminic acid derivatives by incorporation of steric bulk at C&#8208;4. Through this size&#8208;controlled method, we have elaborated a novel synthetic route that exclusively produces the potent anti&#8208;influenza drug candidate; 2,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;zanamivir analogue with C&#8208;3 eq fluoride.







Abstract
3&#8208;Fluoroneuraminosyl fluorides are invaluable probes for studying the catalytic mechanism of sialidases (neuraminidases), and as sialidase inhibitors. Significantly, when a C&#8208;3 equatorial fluorine is installed on a C&#8208;4 functionalised N&#8208;acylneuraminic acid (Neu)&#8208;based template, the compounds are potent and selective inhibitors of both influenza and parainfluenza sialidases, and of virus replication. Typically, the reported syntheses of 3&#8208;fluoroneuraminosyl fluorides involve either an enzymatic or a chemical synthesis that have uncontrolled stereoselectivity in the introduction of fluorine at C&#8208;3 of Neu and consequently yield a mixture of C&#8208;3 ax and C&#8208;3 eq fluoro derivatives. We now report a simple approach for the exquisitely stereo&#8208;controlled introduction of the C&#8208;3 equatorial fluorine on Neu by incorporation of steric bulk at C&#8208;4. Through this method, we have elaborated a novel synthetic route that exclusively produces the potent anti&#8208;influenza drug candidate; 2,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;zanamivir analogue with C&#8208;3 eq fluoride.

         <title>Organic Luminescent Cocrystals Based on Benzotriazole Derivatives: Synthesis, Characterization, Crystal Structure and Fluorescence Behavior</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The involvement of benzotriazole derivatives in cocrystal formation is studied systematically for the first time. Two novel cocrystals with tunable photoluminescence behavior featuring directional hydrogen bonding through benzotriazole derivatives acting as different roles is presented and characterized for their crystal structure, self&#8208;assembling manner and optical properties which can be used for label anti&#8208;counterfeiting techniques and acid&#8208;alkali response.







Abstract
Organic cocrystals have garnered significant research attention owing to their distinctive properties and promising applications. However, challenges in molecular structure design and control of intermolecular interactions continue to impede further advancements. In this study, two novel cocrystals were successfully formed from a series of synthesized benzotriazole derivatives. The resulting cocrystals exhibit bright green and yellow fluorescence under 365&#8201;nm light. To elucidate the microstructure of the obtained cocrystals, systematic characterization techniques such as solid&#8208;state fluorescence emission spectroscopy, Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD), Power X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) and density functional theory (DFT) were performed. These benzotriazole&#8208;based cocrystals demonstrate distinct fluorescent responses to alkaline and acidic environments, respectively. Additionally, preliminary tests for fingerprint recognition yielded satisfactory results. These findings suggest that the two cocrystals hold potential applications in acid&#8208;alkali sensing, anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels, and smart material development, while also providing valuable insights for the design and optimization of solid&#8208;state luminescent materials.

         <title>Responsive Surfactant&#8208;Driven Morphology Transformation of Block Copolymer Microparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the impact of responsive surfactants on the morphology of BCP microparticles, focusing on how external stimuli such as temperature, pH, and light influence the interfacial interactions between surfactants and BCPs. In addition, the review also highlights the applications of shape&#8208;switchable BCP microparticles in the fields of smart displays, fluorescence modulation, MRI, drug release, and photonic crystals.







Abstract
Block copolymer (BCP) microparticles, which exhibit rapid change of morphology and physicochemical property in response to external stimuli, represent a promising avenue for the development of programmable smart materials. Among the methods available for generating BCP microparticles with adjustable morphologies, the confined assembly of BCPs within emulsions has emerged as a particularly facile and versatile approach. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the role of responsive surfactants in modulating interfacial interactions at the oil&#8208;water interface, which facilitates controlled BCP microparticle morphology. We elucidate how variations in the properties of responsive surfactants, activated by external stimuli, influence BCP chain arrangement and interfacial selectivity. Additionally, this review explores the applications of shape&#8208;switchable microparticles in advanced technologies such as smart display, fluorescence modulation, magnetic resonance imaging, drug delivery, and photonic crystal. Finally, the challenges and prospective future directions in this rapidly evolving field are discussed.

         <title>Rapid and Sustainable Electrochemical Pd Catalyst Generation from Bulk Metal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electric current was used to generate a &#8220;cocktail&#8221;&#8208;type active Pd catalyst from a bulk metal electrode in an ionic liquid medium for the efficient cross&#8208;coupling of aryl iodides/bromides and boronic acids. According to mechanistic investigations, Pd metal was transferred to a solution as a Pd2+ complex with an ionic liquid. Then, the complex was reduced on a counterelectrode, generating Pd NPs, which catalyzed the cross&#8208;coupling reaction.







Abstract
Palladium catalysts constitute a cornerstone of modern chemistry with upmost scientific and industrial impact. Bulk palladium metal itself is chemically inert, and a sequence of chemical transformations has to be utilized to convert the metal into a Pd precatalyst covered by ligands. However, the &#8220;cocktail&#8221; concept of catalysis discovered recently has shown that Pd systems can efficiently operate in catalysis without the need for a complicated and expensive preinstalled ligand environment. Here, we point out on a green and sustainable process for the generation of Pd active species without the need for waste&#8208;abundant precatalyst&#8208;related chemistry. In this work, an electric current was used to generate an active Pd catalyst from a bulk metal in an ionic liquid medium for the efficient cross&#8208;coupling of aryl iodides/bromides and boronic acids. A synthetically important Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling was utilized as a representative test reaction to confirm the idea. Notably, an electric current is used only at the Pd dissolution stage. Afterwards, the electrodes are removed from the reaction mixture, and a standard reaction procedure can be followed. The reported catalyst preparation process via electrochemical dissolution is potentially compatible with several already existing catalytic methods.

         <title>Aqueous Binder with Self&#8208;Emulsifying Characteristics for Practical Si/C Anode in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aqueous binder suitable for practical Si/C anodes was synthesized by utilizing the self&#8208;emulsifying characteristics of polyvinyl alcohol grafted poly(methyl methacrylate). Due to the high bonding strength and stabilizing effect on SEI, the rate performance and cycling stability of Si/C anodes using this binder are significantly improved.







Abstract
Silicon/carbon (Si/C) materials have achieved commercial applications as a solution to the problems of large volume expansion and short lifespan of silicon&#8208;based anodes in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the potential risk of structural fracture and localized differences in surface adsorption properties lead to difficulties in maintaining the structural integrity of Si/C anodes using conventional binders during repeated lithiation/delithiation. Herein, an aqueous binder (PVA&#8208;g&#8208;M) based on polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) grafted methacrylic acid (MAA) obtained by self&#8208;emulsifying emulsion polymerization is reported. The introduction of carboxyl groups of MAA enables PVA&#8208;g&#8208;M to form more hydrogen bonds, thereby enhancing both the cohesion of the binder film and its adhesion to silicon&#8208;based surface. Simultaneously, the methyl&#8208;containing segments of MAA can wet the carbon&#8208;based surface, thereby enhancing the adhesion of PVA&#8208;g&#8208;M to carbonaceous materials. In addition, the hydroxyl groups on both the PVA segments and the silicon surface can be esterified with the carboxyl groups during the heat treatment, thus further improving the bonding strength. As&#8208;prepared Si/C anodes with PVA&#8208;g&#8208;M binder can significantly inhibit the electrode volume expansion and maintain high structural integrity during cycling as well as form SEIs with high lithium fluoride content, showing excellent cycling stability (81.1&#8201;% capacity retention after 300 cycles).

&lt;p&gt;An aqueous binder suitable for practical Si/C anodes was synthesized by utilizing the self-emulsifying characteristics of polyvinyl alcohol grafted poly(methyl methacrylate). Due to the high bonding strength and stabilizing effect on SEI, the rate performance and cycling stability of Si/C anodes using this binder are significantly improved.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silicon/carbon (Si/C) materials have achieved commercial applications as a solution to the problems of large volume expansion and short lifespan of silicon-based anodes in lithium-ion batteries. However, the potential risk of structural fracture and localized differences in surface adsorption properties lead to difficulties in maintaining the structural integrity of Si/C anodes using conventional binders during repeated lithiation/delithiation. Herein, an aqueous binder (PVA&lt;i&gt;-g-&lt;/i&gt;M) based on polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) grafted methacrylic acid (MAA) obtained by self-emulsifying emulsion polymerization is reported. The introduction of carboxyl groups of MAA enables PVA&lt;i&gt;-g-&lt;/i&gt;M to form more hydrogen bonds, thereby enhancing both the cohesion of the binder film and its adhesion to silicon-based surface. Simultaneously, the methyl-containing segments of MAA can wet the carbon-based surface, thereby enhancing the adhesion of PVA&lt;i&gt;-g-&lt;/i&gt;M to carbonaceous materials. In addition, the hydroxyl groups on both the PVA segments and the silicon surface can be esterified with the carboxyl groups during the heat treatment, thus further improving the bonding strength.

         <title>Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer Dynamic Mechanism in V&#8208;Shaped Flexible Carbazole Aromatic Imides Dyads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cofacial electron donor&#8208;acceptor dyads exhibit through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transfer (TSCT) characteristics. In V&#8208;shaped flexible dyads, the formation of a pseudo&#8208;cofacial conformation in the excited state enhances charge&#8208;transfer coupling. Femtosecond spectroscopy reveals ultrafast TSCT dynamics, with rates significantly increase in concentrated solutions, explaining the emission enhancement in weakly coupled TSCT emitters transitioning from solution to aggregation states.







Abstract
Cofacial electron donor&#8208;acceptor dyads exhibiting through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transfer (TSCT) characteristics are widely employed in the development of optoelectronic functional materials. The flexible molecular frameworks between the electron donor and acceptor components allow dynamic modulation of electronic coupling, influenced by excited&#8208;state structural relaxation or intermolecular interactions, thereby affecting the charge&#8208;transfer (CT) dynamics and the emission properties of TSCT states. In this work, we examine the TSCT dynamic processes of two electron donor&#8208;acceptor dyads, CzPhNI and CzPhPI formed by ortho&#8208;substitution of phenyl linkage with V&#8208;shaped flexible TSCT structures using carbazole as donor and naphthalimide or phthalimide as acceptor. A pseudo&#8208;cofacial TSCT conformation formed in the excited state effectively shortens the donor&#8208;acceptor distance and enhances CT coupling. Femtosecond spectroscopy reveals an ultrafast TSCT kinetics in the (200&#8197;fs)&#8722;1 timescale. Moreover, the intermolecular interaction&#8208;induced D&#8722;A stacking further strengthens the electronic coupling, accelerating the TSCT reaction rate from (2.07&#8197;ps)&#8722;1 to (174&#8197;fs)&#8722;1 as solution concentrations increases from 10&#8722;5 to 10&#8722;3&#8197;M. The results obtained in this work offers valuable physical insights into the TSCT dynamic mechanism, potentially explaining the widely observed emission enhancement in weakly&#8208;coupled, flexible TSCT emitters transitioning from solution to aggregation states.

         <title>Unilateral and Bilateral Disulfurating Reagents for the Synthesis of Unsymmetrical Polysulfides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unilateral or Bilateral disulfurating reagents offer an opportunity to build a series of functionalized unsymmetrical disulfide molecules from easily accessible starting materials. This concept summarizes the progress and current limitations of disulfide reagents. We also discussed future efforts to enlarge the disulfide reagent strategy into a valuable alternative for constructing unsymmetrical functional polysulfide molecules.







Abstract
Polysulfides play an essential role across various fields, including life sciences, pharmaceuticals, food science, and materials science. However, the controlled sequential installation of groups at both ends of an S&#8722;S motif poses enormous challenges due to the reversible nature of the covalent S&#8722;S bond. Utilizing unique disulfide reagents presents one of the most straightforward approaches for constructing diverse polysulfides. This concept highlights the initiatives and advancements in polysulfide synthesis facilitated by unilateral or bilateral disulfide reagents. Furthermore, ongoing research is focused on recently reported methodologies for synthesizing unsymmetrical disulfides.

         <title>Improving the Long&#8208;term Enantioselectivity of a Silicon&#8208;Carbon Bond&#8208;Forming Enzyme</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantioselectivity is a key advantage of enzymatic catalysis. Understanding the most important factors influencing enantioselectivity necessitates thorough investigation for each specific enzyme. In this study, we explore various approaches to optimize reaction conditions for organosilicon production using an immobilized Cytochrome C recently tailored via directed evolution. Over extended reactions, this enzyme experiences a loss of enantioselectivity. Mass spectrometry (MS) revealed covalent modifications on the enzyme, but mutating the respective amino acids did not restore enantioselectivity. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), along with a detailed comparison of the influence of reaction components such as cosolvents and reducing agents, indicated significant conformational changes in the presence of the diazo ester substrate. Additionally, we identified sodium ascorbate as a suitable and milder reducing agent compared to the previously used sodium dithionite, ensuring anaerobic conditions for silicon&#8208;carbon bond formation. Ultimately, maintaining a high enzyme&#8208;to&#8208;substrate ratio in the reaction was found to be crucial for achieving high enantiomeric purity of the organosilicon product over four days in sequential, repetitive batch reactions, thus improving the previously established reaction system. The methods and findings presented here are particularly valuable for addressing enantioselectivity issues in other enzymes that operate with diazo compounds as the substrates in carbene&#8208;transfer reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Translocation&#8208;Coupled Ligand&#8208;Binding/Release by Dinuclear Rhodium Sandwich Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Switching the location of metal atoms or ions in a molecule has been of great interest as a behavior of molecular machines. We describe herein that the reversible metal translocation can be coupled with the ligand&#8208;binding/release of organometallic complexes. The two rhodium moieties sandwiched between arylpolyene ligands exhibit metal&#8208;assembly and disassembly through reversible migration between the arene site and the olefin site, in response to the association and dissociation of additional ligands. This occurs either with bridging or even non&#8208;bridging ligands, where the latter involves oxidative &#960;&#8208;addition of the unsaturated hydrocarbon binder to the metal moieties. The assembling&#8208; and disassembling states were characterized by NMR and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular Redox&#8208;driven Synthesis of Mono&#8208; and Diradical Iridium(III) Complexes: Insights into Molecular and Electronic Structure, Electrochemistry, and Spin&#8208;Communication</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two &#960;&#8208;radical complexes containing bisazo&#8208;aromatic&#8208;centered radical anion (1&#8226;&#8722;) were synthesized through in&#8208;situ electron transfer from metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand using [IrI] and 2&#8208;(2&#8208;Pyridylazo)azobenzene (1) in inert hydrocarbon solvent. These are characterized as diradical [IrIII(1&#8226;&#8722;)2]+[2]+ and monoradical [IrIII(1&#8226;&#8722;)Cl2(PPh3)] 3. In contrast, a rare metal&#8208;mediated hydrolytic cleavage of the C(sp2)&#8211;N bond occurred in protic solvent resulting in quaternary radical complex [IrIII(1&#8226;&#8722;)(1&#8242;)(PPh3)]+(4)+. This provides an easy way to synthesize stable unsubstituted pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;diazotate (1&#8242;), an otherwise unstable organic template. Theoretical scrutiny has been performed at (U)B3LYP/6&#8208;31G(d,p)/LANL2DZ level to explore the origin of redox and optical properties in radical complexes. Magnetic study of [2]+ reveals that a weak antiferromagnetic (AF) spin&#8208;communication (J = &#8722;4.39 cm&#8722;1) exists between two radicals, leading to an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state. Broken symmetry density functional theory (BS&#8208;DFT) calculations were carried out to probe the nature of antiferromagnetic exchange interaction between the two radical centers in species [2]+. This method has been employed with different basis functionals (BP86, BLYP, OLYP, TPSS0, TPSSh, &#969;b97D and B3LYP) to comprehend the nature of the exchange in [2]+. The best result is obtained for pure functional OLYP with a J value &#8722;8.4 cm&#8722;1.</dc:description>

Theoretical scrutiny has been performed at (U)B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)/LANL2DZ level to explore the origin of redox and optical properties in radical complexes. Magnetic study of [2]+ reveals that a weak antiferromagnetic (AF) spin-communication (J = &#8722;4.39 cm&#8722;1) exists between two radicals, leading to an open-shell singlet ground state. Broken symmetry density functional theory (BS-DFT) calculations were carried out to probe the nature of antiferromagnetic exchange interaction between the two radical centers in species [2]+. This method has been employed with different basis functionals (BP86, BLYP, OLYP, TPSS0, TPSSh, &#969;b97D and B3LYP) to comprehend the nature of the exchange in [2]+. The best result is obtained for pure functional OLYP with a J value &#8722;8.4 cm&#8722;1.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Metal&#8208;MOF Interfaces for Selective CO&#8322; Hydrogenation to Methanol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 6, January 27, 2025. </description>

Engineering metal&#8208;MOF interfaces unlocks new potential for selective CO&#8322; hydrogenation to methanol. Leveraging tunable structures, high surface areas, and strong metal&#8208;support interactions, MOF&#8208;based catalysts enhance methanol selectivity and stability. This paper explores Cu&#8722;Zn and Zn&#8722;Zr interfaces in MOFs, aiming to revolutionize methanol synthesis by improving active site dispersion and catalytic performance.







Abstract
The hydrogenation of CO&#8322; to methanol is a promising pathway toward sustainable fuel production and carbon recycling. A key factor in the efficiency of this process lies in the interaction between the metal catalyst and its support. Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as highly effective platforms due to their tunable structures, large surface areas, and ability to form stable interfaces with single&#8211;atom metals or metal nanoparticles. These metal&#8208;MOF interfaces are crucial for stabilizing active sites, preventing sintering, and enhancing catalytic performance. In this concept paper, we explore the role of these interfaces in promoting CO&#8322; hydrogenation, focusing on Cu&#8722;Zn, Cu&#8722;Zr, and Zn&#8722;Zr interfaces. The formation of strong interactions between metal sites and MOF nodes enables precise control over the dispersion and electronic environment of the active species, significantly improving methanol selectivity and long&#8208;term stability. By analyzing recent advancements in MOF&#8208;supported catalysts, this work highlights the concept of engineered metal&#8208;MOF interfaces to drive the development of next&#8208;generation catalysts for efficient methanol synthesis from CO&#8322;.

Two linear and polynuclear complexes of neptunium (Np) featuring mono&#8208;&#956;2&#8208;oxo motifs have been observed and were generated by a reduction/condensation reaction sequence that is driven by proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET).

         <title>Synthesis of Bis(diimino)palladium Nanosheets as Highly Active Electrocatalysts for Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 6, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis(diimino)palladium (PdDI) coordination nanosheets were synthesized using gas&#8208;liquid interfacial synthesis and electrochemical oxidation. The catalytic activity evaluation for hydrogen evolution reaction revealed the remarkable catalytic performance of activated PdDI which is comparable to that of metallic platinum despite using a tiny number of precious metals.







Abstract
Development of efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) is necessary to achieve environmentally friendly and sustainable hydrogen production. To reduce cost and to circumvent the scarcity of platinum, the most efficient catalyst for HER, it is essential to develop catalysts using ubiquitous base metals or minimal amounts of precious metals. Bis(diimino)metal (MDI) coordination nanosheets are potential HER catalysts because their electric conductivities, two&#8208;dimensionality, and porous structures provide large surface areas and efficient mass and electron transfer. In addition, with sparse metal arrangements in their chemical structures, nanosheets can reduce the amount of metal needed. We synthesized bis(diimino)palladium coordination nanosheets (PdDI) as a coordination polymer composed of bis(diimino)palladium, with semiconducting characteristics, using gas&#8208;liquid interfacial synthesis and electrochemical oxidation. These electrochemically synthesized PdDIs exhibit remarkable catalytic performance with overpotential reaching 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 of 34&#8197;mV, a Tafel slope of 47&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, and an exchange current density of 2.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 after appropriate activation. This performance is closely comparable to that of metallic platinum. An ex&#8208;situ investigation of the activation process revealed that reduction of the divalent Pd center in bis(diimino)palladium produced a composite of Pd(0) species and PdDI, combining high catalytic activity with smooth electron transfer.

         <title>Flipping the Metalation of 4&#8208;Dimethylaminopyridine: Steric Repulsion versus London Dispersion Attraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 6, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate the effective utilization of steric interactions for flipping the lithiation of 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). Introduction of a Me3Si substituent to the position 1 of DMAP or simple complexation with t&#8208;BuLi allows selective C3&#8208;lithiation, due to the steric hindrance of a C2&#8722;H bond. The utilization of i&#8208;Pr3Si substituent leads to exclusive C2&#8208;functionalization due to the dispersion interactions with organometallic bases.







Abstract
Non&#8208;covalent interactions, including the coordination of an organolithium reagent by a directing group and the steric hindrance from substituents, play a crucial role in determining the selectivity of metalation reactions. Here, we demonstrate the effective utilization of steric interactions for flipping the lithiation of 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). Introduction of a Me3Si substituent to the position 1 of DMAP or simple complexation with t&#8208;BuLi allows selective C3&#8208;lithiation, due to the steric hindrance of a C2&#8722;H bond by the bulky moiety at the pyridine nitrogen. This simple approach creates a convenient way to achieve the selective C3&#8208;functionalization of DMAP. In contrast, the utilization of an even bulkier i&#8208;Pr3Si substituent leads to exclusive C2&#8208;functionalization due to the dispersion interactions with organometallic bases. For the first time, it is demonstrated that the i&#8208;Pr3Si moiety can serve as a directing group, providing a new type of directed ortho&#8208;metalation effect.

This simple approach creates a convenient way to achieve the selective C3-functionalization of DMAP. In contrast, the utilization of an even bulkier &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;-Pr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si substituent leads to exclusive C2-functionalization due to the dispersion interactions with organometallic bases. For the first time, it is demonstrated that the &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;-Pr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si moiety can serve as a directing group, providing a new type of directed &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-metalation effect.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution from Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 6, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoelectrochemical properties and photocatalytic performance over hydrogen evoluation reaction of covalent organic frameworks can be significantly affected through molecular engineering of nitrogen sites by regulating the content and position of nitrogen atoms in the COFs. As a result, the optimal photocatalyst TpPpm with excellent capacities of charge transfer and electron&#8208;hole separation exhibits superior hydrogen production rates among all COFs.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have demonstrated significant potential as photocatalysts for efficiently generating hydrogen through photocatalytic water splitting. However, the design of COFs with distinct organic unit blocks at a molecular level profoundly influences their photocatalytic performance. In this study, we synthesized a series of &#946;&#8208;ketoamine COFs through molecular engineering of nitrogen sites, including phenyl&#8208;structured TpBD, phenylpyridine&#8208;structured TpPpy, phenylpyrimidine&#8208;structured TpPpm, and bipyridine&#8208;structured TpBpy. Advanced characterization techniques reveal that TpPpm and TpBpy with more nitrogen sites exhibit superior efficiencies in electron transfer and charge separation compared to TpBD and TpPpy, thereby endowing them with enhanced photocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution from water. As a result, the photocatalytic hydrogen production rates of TpPpm (33.80&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and TpBpy (29.18&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) surpass those of TpBD (20.82&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and TpPpy (27.49&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). Additionally, due to the different plane symmetries between Ppm and Bpy resulting from the various positions of nitrogen sites, TpPpm displays superior photochemical properties and better photocatalytic performance compared to TpBpy. Moreover, theoretical calculation results further confirm the exceptional intramolecular charge transfer ability of TpPpm among all COFs. This work underscores the significance of precisely controlling N sites in COFs for designing high&#8208;performance photocatalysts.

         <title>An Organic Vapor&#8208;Responsive Actuator Based on a Novel Urea Macrocycle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 6, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymeric composite incorporating a novel urea macrocycle as a filler has been shown to act as a soft actuator that is responsive to organic solvent vapors. The actuation mechanism arises from a crystalline phase transition of the urea macrocycle at the molecular level, driven by host&#8211;guest interactions.







Abstract
The mechanical actuation of smart materials has garnered considerable attention in biological and medical research due to their ability to mimic biological processes at both molecular level, such as conformational changes in individual compounds, and at the macroscopic level, where polymeric substrates respond to external stimuli. In this study, we present a polymeric composite incorporating a novel urea macrocycle as a filler, forming a soft actuator that responds to various organic solvent vapors. The underlying actuation mechanism is attributed to crystalline phase transition of urea macrocycle, driven by the host&#8211;guest interactions with diverse guest molecules. This work provides valuable insights for advancing the design of supramolecular hosts in smart material applications.

Abstract
The first catalytic enantioselective intramolecular allylic dearomatization of allylic alcohol tethered &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;naphthols has been developed with iridium/acid&#8208;dual catalysis. A wide range of polycyclic spiroketones containing vicinal tertiary and quaternary carbon stereocenters were readily prepared in good to high yields with high diastereo&#8208; and moderate to excellent enantioselectivities. An unusual anti&#8208;Markovnikov Wacker oxidation has also been shown in synthetic transformations.

         <title>A Stable Carbon&#8208;Centered Radical Showing Six Amphoteric Redox States</title>

A fully conjugated system built by alternate fusion of four benzene and three cyclopentadiene rings is a further rare example of an air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable carbon&#8208;centered hydrocarbon radical. It was synthesized by double ortho fusion and was extensively characterized by spectroscopic and computational methods.







Abstract
An air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable hydrocarbon radical with four six&#8208; and three five&#8208;membered rings alternately fused to a heptacycle was obtained by ortho fusion in a suitably ortho,ortho&#8217;&#8208;substituted diphenylfluorene and subsequent re&#8208;establishment of the conjugation. The radical was obtained in five consecutive steps from commercially available starting materials with a total yield of 34&#8201;%; key steps are Suzuki couplings and cyclizing SEAr reactions. Mesityl substituents at the five&#8208;membered rings ensure the stability of the radical. This cyclopenta&#8208;fused polyaromatic hydrocarbon (CP&#8208;PAH) was characterized by EPR and UV/Vis spectroscopy and by cyclic voltammetry. Quantum chemical calculation disclosed further properties and led to simulated spectra (spin densities, aromaticity, orbital energies, and UV/Vis/NIR). This radical is best described with the unpaired electron centered in the outer five&#8208;membered rings; these resonance formulas show the largest number of fully intact benzene rings. Its triradical character was computed to be very small and can be neglected. The five&#8208;membered rings show notable antiaromatic character, especially in the central ring. The constitution of the radical could be further substantiated by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of its direct precursor.

Abstract
The ubiquitous molecular chaperone Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is pivotal in many cellular processes through folding of client proteins under stressed and normal conditions. Despite intensive research on its function as a chaperone, the influence of posttranslational modifications on Hsp90 (the &#8216;chaperone code&#8217;), and its interactions with co&#8208;chaperones and client proteins, still remains to be elucidated. The C&#8208;terminal domain (CTD) of Hsp90 is essential for formation of the active homodimer state of Hsp90 and contains recognition sites for co&#8208;chaperones and client proteins. Here we used expressed protein selenoester ligation to introduce site&#8208;selective phosphorylations in the Hsp90 CTD, while preserving the native amino acid sequence. The two phosphorylations do not affect the overall secondary structure, but in combination, slightly decrease the thermal stability of the CTD. The Hsp90 CTD functions as a chaperone in decreasing aggregation of model client proteins, but the C&#8208;terminal phosphorylations do not significantly alter the anti&#8208;aggregation activity for these clients. The optimization of expressed protein selenoester ligation (EPSL) to carry out several steps in one pot provides an efficient route to access site&#8208;specifically modified Hsp90 CTD variants, allowing the generation of Hsp90 variants with site&#8208;specific PTMs to decipher the chaperone code.

         <title>Phenazinium&#8208; and Malachite Green&#8208;Based Pd(II) Cages: Chiroptical Discrimination of Nucleoside Triphosphates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 6, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of two coal&#8208;tar dyes, purple N&#8208;ethyl phenazinium (PHP) and malachite green (MGP), into the backbones of bis&#8208;monodentate ligands capable of forming lantern&#8208;shaped Pd2L4 coordination cages is shown. Cage Pd2(PHP)4 was used together with methylene blue cage Pd2(MBP)4 to differentiate between nucleoside triphosphates in solution through CD spectroscopy.







Abstract
Organic chromophores have been successfully implemented into supramolecular systems to bestow them with distinct photophysical properties for various applications, ranging from solar energy conversion, photochemical reactions or as receptors for guest molecules with optical readout. We had previously introduced first members of the large family of coal&#8208;tar dyes (methylene blue, crystal violet and rhodamine) as integral components of coordination cages. Here, we add two new chromophores, malachite green (MGP) and a purple phenazinium dye (PHP), serving as backbones of bis&#8208;monodentate banana&#8208;shaped ligands with pyridine donors. We show the formation of corresponding green and purple coloured Pd2L4 coordination cages and investigate their interaction with chiral guest molecules via UV&#8208;Vis and CD spectroscopy. The PHP cage can be used to recognize nucleoside triphosphates, based on chirality transfer from the guests to the structurally flexible helicate. In combination with the already known methylene blue cage MBP we could further differentiate between all four canonical NTPs through characteristic changes in the observed CD signatures.

         <title>Synthesis and Photophysical Properties of 4&#8217;&#8208;5&#8217; Disubstituted CinNapht Dyes Accessible through Double SNAr Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization</title>

         <dc:description>
The synthesis of 4&#8242;, 5&#8242; di&#8208;substituted CinNapht dyes is reported. Two new families have been obtained using either double addition of aromatic amines or addition of inner di&#8208;nucleophiles. The photophysical properties of all the fluorophores have been investigated and rationalized thanks to DFT and TD/DFT calculations. The most promising compounds have been used in live cell imaging experiments







Abstract
This article describes the synthesis of a difluorinated CinNapht derivative in the 4&#8242; and 5&#8242; positions allowing the easy access to two new families of fluorophores by late&#8208;stage functionalization using SNAr. The first one comprises derivatives incorporating hindered aromatic amines in the 4&#8242; and 5&#8242; positions, which show red&#8208;emission in apolar solvents. The second one is obtained through the use of dinucleophiles. Among them, Tetrahydroquinoxaline (THQ) and tetrahydrobenzodiazepine (THB) compounds show strongly redshifted emission. The photophysical properties of all the fluorophores in these two families are studied and rationalized by DFT and TDDFT calculations. The most promising compounds have been used to image living cells by confocal microscopy.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 6, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new protocol for C&#8722;H silylation and germylation of azauracils has been developed under mild reaction conditions. This method is applied to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules including gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, and naproxen derivatives.







Abstract
The current study demonstrates a Cu(I) catalyzed direct C(sp2)&#8722;H silylation and germylation of azauracil using triphenylsilane and triphenylgermane. A broad scope, excellent functional group tolerance, and suitability for large&#8208;scale reactions are exhibited in this protocol. Moreover, this method can be readily applied to structurally complex bioactive molecules. Experimental results suggest a radical mechanistic pathway for the reaction.

         <title>A Multistep Oxidative Cascade Reaction from a Naphthalenediol&#8208;Based Pre&#8208;Ligand to a Tetranuclear Perylenequinone&#8208;Based FeIII Complex</title>

Two 1,8&#8208;naphthalenediol&#8208;based ligands are coupled in a multistep oxidative cascade reaction to a tetranuclear perylenequinone&#8208;based FeIII complex involving an overall 10&#8208;electron oxidation. The assignment of the electronic structure of the new backbone is based on experimental data supported by DFT calculations.







Abstract
We have developed a family of dinuclear complexes using 2,7&#8208;disubstituted 1,8&#8208;naphthalenediol ligands that bind by molecular recognition to two neighboring phosphate diesters of the DNA backbone with the dinuclear CuII and NiII complexes exhibiting a severe cytotoxicity for human cancer cells. To increase the binding affinity, we intended to synthesize the corresponding dinuclear FeIII complex. Surprisingly, we obtained a tetranuclear FeIII perylene&#8208;based complex instead of the expected dinuclear FeIII naphthalene&#8208;based complex. In order to establish a rational and reproducible synthesis, we carefully analyzed this reaction. This revealed a multistep oxidative cascade reaction including the pre&#8208;coordination of FeII ions in the N3&#8208;binding pockets, the Lewis&#8208;acid assisted MOM&#8208;deprotection of the pre&#8208;ligand by the pre&#8208;oriented FeII ions, two oxidative aromatic C&#8722;C coupling reactions, oxidation of the perylene&#8208;based backbone and of FeII to FeIII. The careful analysis of bond lengths, HOMA indices (harmonic oscillation model of aromaticity), FTIR and UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR spectra supported by DFT calculations reveals the presence of an aromatic 18&#8208;electron oxidized perylenequinone ligand backbone. In summary, a multistep cascade reaction involving in total a 10&#8208;electron oxidation has been established for the straight&#8208;forward synthesis of an unprecedented perylenequinone&#8208;based ligand system.

         <title>Click Coupling of Flavylium Dyes with Plasmodione Analogues: Towards New Redox&#8208;Sensitive Pro&#8208;Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 6, January 27, 2025. </description>

Redox&#8208;sensitive pro&#8208;fluorophores based on azido&#8208;flavyliums clicked to alkynyl analogues of plasmodione oxide have been developed. In their quinone form, the fluorescence is quenched by photoinduced electron process (PeT) and restored after reducing to hydroquinone. PEG chain length modulates the amplitude of fluorogenic response. Due to their properties, these hybrid compounds have the potential to evaluate redox alterations in parasitized erythrocytes.







Abstract
The development of redox&#8208;sensitive molecular fluorescent probes for the detection of redox changes in Plasmodium falciparum&#8208;parasitized red blood cells remains of interest due to the limitations of current genetically encoded biosensors. This study describes the design, screening and synthesis of new pro&#8208;fluorophores based on flavylium azido dyes coupled by CuAAC click chemistry to alkynyl analogues of plasmodione oxide, the key metabolite of the potent redox&#8208;active antimalarial plasmodione. The photophysical and electrochemical properties of these probes were evaluated, focusing on their fluorogenic responses. The influence of both the redox status of the quinone and the length of the PEG chain separating the fluorophore from the electrophore on the photophysical properties was investigated. The fluorescence quenching by photoinduced electron transfer is reversible and of high amplitude for probes in oxidized quinone forms and fluorescence is reinstated for reduced hydroquinone forms. Our results demonstrate that shortening the PEG chain has the effect of enhancing the fluorogenic response, likely due to non&#8208;covalent interactions between the two chromophores. All these systems were evaluated for their antiparasitic activities and fluorescence imaging suggests the efficacy of the fluorescent flavylium dyes in P. falciparum&#8208;parasitized red blood cells, paving the way for future parasite imaging studies to monitor cellular redox processes.

         <title>Higher Assemblies of Coordination Cage&#8208;Catenanes Linked by Copper(II) Chloride Clusters: Networks and Transformations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 6, January 27, 2025. </description>

Serendipitous scavenging of chloride contaminant on reaction of Cu(NO3)2 with tris(nicotinoyl)cyclotriguaiacylene gives a tetramer of metal&#8208;organic cages bridged through {Cu4(&#956;&#8208;Cl)6Cl2(OH2)2} cluster into a dimer of cage&#8208;catenanes. Reaction with CuCl2 gives a similar motif but linked in a 2D polymer through further copper chloride bridging. Both materials show alteration of Cu(II) bridging on solvent&#8208;exchange.







Abstract
Cage&#8208;catenanes are chemical constructs where two or more cage&#8208;like molecules or assemblies are mechanically interlocked together. We report a new class of cage&#8208;catenanes where dimeric metal&#8208;organic cage&#8208;catenanes are linked into larger assemblies through additional bridging metal chloride links. These crystalline materials are obtained from the reaction of tris(nicotinoyl)cyclotriguaiacylene (L1) with Cu(II) salts, and all feature a tetramer of cages where two {Cu3(L1)2(X)6} cages (X=anion) are mechanically interlocked, and link to each other and to another {Cu3(L1)2(X)6}2 cage&#8208;catenane through a planar, linear tetranuclear {Cu4(&#956;&#8208;Cl)6Cl2} cluster. The complex of discrete tetrameric {Cu3(L1)2(X)6}4 assemblies (dimers of cage&#8208;catenanes) transforms through solvent&#8208;exchange processes to 1D coordination chain structures through additional {Cu2(&#956;&#8208;Cl)2} bridges between the tetrameric {Cu3(L1)2(X)6}4 assemblies. Complex [Cu6(L1)4Cl12(H2O)3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(H2O)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;15(DMF) C2 features a 2D coordination network of 63 topology linked through three different Cu(II) clusters, namely {Cu4(&#956;&#8208;Cl)6}, {Cu2(&#956;&#8208;Cl)2} and a rare linear {Cu2(&#956;&#8208;Cl)} linkage. Break&#8208;down of C2 in water likely proceeds through hydrolysis of this unusual linear Cu&#8208;Cl&#8208;Cl bond.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Incorporation of Fluorinated Prolines into Proteins and Their Impact on Neighbouring Residues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 6, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elena&#8208;Real et al. present a new approach for the site&#8208;specific incorporation of fluoroprolines in proteins. Using NMR, they show that the trans/cis ratio depends on the fluoroproline type and the sequence context, and that the spectroscopic perturbations on neighbouring atoms correlate with their distance to fluorine. These results validate this site&#8208;specific incorporation as an excellent strategy to monitor protein structure.







Abstract
The incorporation of fluorinated amino acids into proteins provides new opportunities to study biomolecular structure&#8208;function relationships in an elegant manner. The available strategies to incorporate the majority of fluorinated amino acids are not site&#8208;specific or imply important structural modifications. Here, we present a chemical biology approach for the site&#8208;specific incorporation of three commercially available C&#947;&#8208;modified fluoroprolines that has been validated using a non&#8208;pathogenic version of huntingtin exon&#8208;1 (HttExon&#8208;1). 19F, 1H and 15N NMR chemical shifts measured for multiple variants of HttExon&#8208;1 indicated that the trans/cis ratio was strongly dependent on the fluoroproline variant and the sequence context. By isotopically labelling the rest of the protein, we have shown that the extent of spectroscopic perturbations to the neighbouring residues depends on the number of fluorine atoms and the stereochemistry at C&#947;, as well as the isomeric form of the fluoroproline. We have rationalized these observations by means of extensive molecular dynamics simulations, indicating that the observed atomic chemical shift perturbations correlate with the distance to fluorine atoms and that the effect remains very local. These results validate the site&#8208;specific incorporation of fluoroprolines as an excellent strategy to monitor intra&#8208; and intermolecular interactions in disordered proline&#8208;rich proteins.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Quaternary Chiral &#946;&#8208;Lactams via Three&#8208;Component Asymmetric Kinugasa/Aldol or Kinugasa/Mannich Cascade Reactions</title>

Asymmetric three&#8208;component coupling to construct hydroxy or amino substituted chiral &#946;&#8208;lactams through Kinugasa/aldol or Kinugasa/Mannich cascade reactions were developed. This strategy enables creating contiguous three stereogenic centers, controlled by copper(I) catalysts and chiral bis(oxazolidine) ligands. The developed protocol features high stereoselectivity, good reaction efficiency, and mild operational condition representing a practical and sustainable synthetic tool for the construction of chiral &#946;&#8208;lactams.







Abstract
The &#946;&#8208;lactam scaffolds are the prevalent structural units in antibiotics and natural products. Herein, three&#8208;component asymmetric Kinugasa/aldol and Kinugasa/Mannich cascade reactions have been developed for constructing &#945;&#8208;quaternary chiral &#946;&#8208;lactams. This method involved the tandem reaction of alkynes, nitrones and aldehydes (or imines), resulting in the formation of three sequential stereocenters controlled by copper(I) catalysts and chiral bis(oxazolidine) ligands. The developed protocol features high enantioselectivity, good reaction efficiency, and mild operational conditions, representing a practical and sustainable synthetic tool for the construction of functionalized chiral &#946;&#8208;lactams.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced ArC(sp3)&#8722;F Bond Activation in Aqueous Media: From DFT Study to Molecular Design</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 6, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photophysical properties of DTMAs, a stepwise photo&#8208;defluorination mechanism and a photo&#8208;induced intramolecular single electron activation model for ArC(sp3)&#8722;F bond in photo&#8208;DAFEx reaction were revealed by TD(DFT) study. Guided by the theoretical studies, new molecules with long excitation wavelength and good activity in photo&#8208;DAFEx reaction were designed and synthesized experimentally.







Abstract
Trifluoromethylarenes (ArCF3) are crucial bioisosteres in medicinal chemistry, but catalyst&#8208;free and controlled photo&#8208;activation of the ArC(sp3)&#8722;F bond remains a significant challenge. The photo&#8208;induced defluorination acyl fluoride exchange (photo&#8208;DAFEx) of m&#8208;trifluoromethylaniline, induced by ultraviolet light, emerges as a promising novel photo&#8208;click reaction for photoaffinity drug discovery. However, the photophysical properties of NMe2PhF2C(sp3)&#8722;F derivatives and factors affecting ArC(sp3)&#8722;F bond activation in photo&#8208;DAFEx are not yet fully understood, hindering the development of new photo&#8208;defluorination reagents with longer absorption wavelength for the photo&#8208;DAFEx. Herein, the photophysical properties, the related mechanism and their affecting factors of a series of ArCF3 compounds are systematically studied using (TD)DFT methods. The skeleton of aromatic core is found to be intimately related to the absorption wavelength needed for ArC(sp3)&#8722;F bond activation. A photo&#8208;induced intramolecular single&#8208;electron activation model was proposed to rationalize the photo&#8208;activation of the ArC(sp3)&#8722;F bond. The transfer of excited electron to C(sp3)&#8722;F antibonding orbital determined the activation. Based on the above knowledge, three novel ArCF3 reagents with extended excitation wavelength were designed and predicted, and the absorption spectra and photo&#8208;defluorination reactivity of two of them with visible absorption wavelength were validated experimentally, which provided a theoretical guidance for designing next&#8208;generation photo&#8208;DAFEx.

         <title>Active Site Engineering of a Glycerol Dehydrogenase Improves its Oxidative Activity and Scope Toward Glycerol Derivatives</title>

The regioselective oxidation of glyceryl alkyl ethers enables hydroxy ketone and enantiopure 1,2&#8208;diol synthesis. Engineering position 252 in GlyDH broadened substrate scope, with BsGlyDH&#8722;L252S emerging as a highly efficient biocatalyst for two&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot deracemization.







Abstract
Regioselective oxidation of glyceryl alkyl ethers is of utmost importance for the fabrication of substituted hydroxy ketones and enantiopure 1,2&#8208;diols as green solvents and pharmaceutical building blocks, respectively. An engineered glycerol dehydrogenase from Bacillus stearothermophilus was described to perform the regioselective oxidation of alkyl glycerol ethers, identifying position 252 as key for accepting larger substrates than glycerol. In this work, we further engineer that position through partial saturation mutagenesis to broaden the substrate scope toward other glycerol derivatives, improving enzyme kinetics and minimizing product inhibition. In particular, the BsGlyDH&#8722;L252S variant becomes the most efficient biocatalyst for the deracemization of alkyl glyceryl ethers in a two&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot immobilized system. The discovery and use of these alternative mutants of GlyDH opens the road to more applications and increases the enzymatic toolbox for the modifications of glyceryl ethers.

         <title>Intermolecular Forces&#8208;Oriented Growth of MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 6, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF heterostructures were constructed through a seeded&#8208;growth process. The self&#8208;assembly of ZIF&#8208;8 particles on the surface of Ni&#8208;MOF and MOF&#8208;74 matrix having mismatched cell lattices, respectively, resulted in well&#8208;organized core&#8208;satellite type Ni&#8208;MOF@ZIF&#8208;8 and core&#8208;shell type MOF&#8208;74@ZIF&#8208;8 hybrids. The integration of two distinct MOFs was supported by the intermolecular forces.







Abstract
Well&#8208;controlled conjugation of distinct metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with dissimilar components and structures into a multi&#8208;component MOF system is important for the design of myriad materials with structural complexity, integrated properties, and desired applications. Herein, we developed an interesting integration strategy that relies on intermolecular force, and which can overcome the difference in lattice parameters. The strategy uses the pre&#8208;formed MOF matrixes as seeds to direct the self&#8208;assembly of secondary MOF particles for the construction of hybrid MOFs. As a proof of concept, the representative core&#8208;satellite&#8208;type Ni&#8208;MOF@ZIF&#8208;8 and core&#8208;shell&#8208;type MOF&#8208;74@ZIF&#8208;8 heterostructures were achieved. Theory calculations elucidate the uncommon formation of well&#8208;defined hybrid MOFs by self&#8208;assembly of secondary ZIF&#8208;8 particles to anchor on Ni&#8208;MOF or MOF&#8208;74 seed surface via hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions. We anticipate that this work opens an avenue to design the multi&#8208;component MOF systems from different MOFs with lattice mismatching.

         <title>Evolution Enhances Kemp Eliminase Activity by Optimizing Oxyanion Stabilization and Conformational Flexibility</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 6, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The HG3&#8208;to&#8208;HG3.17 evolutionary pathway enhances Kemp eliminase activity by refining active&#8208;site interactions and enhancing conformational dynamics. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that a water&#8208;mediated network of non&#8208;covalent interactions supports a catalytically competent conformation. Gln50 contributes to oxyanion stabilization, while Trp44 regulates Gln50 flexibility, influencing active&#8208;site preorganization and catalytic efficiency for the most evolved variant HG3.17.







Abstract
The base&#8208;promoted Kemp elimination reaction has been used as a model system for enzyme design. Among the multiple computationally designed and evolved Kemp eliminases generated along the years, the HG3&#8208;to&#8208;HG3.17 evolutionary trajectory is particularly interesting due to the high catalytic efficiency of HG3.17 and the debated role of glutamine 50 (Gln50) as potential oxyanion stabilizer. This study aims to elucidate the structural and dynamic changes along the evolutionary pathway from HG3 to HG3.17 that contribute to improved catalytic efficiency. In particular, we evaluate key variants along the HG3 evolutionary trajectory via molecular dynamics simulations coupled to non&#8208;covalent interactions and water analysis. Our computational study indicates that HG3.17 can adopt a catalytically competent conformation promoted by a water&#8208;mediated network of non&#8208;covalent interactions, in which aspartate 127 (Asp127) is properly positioned for proton abstraction and Gln50 and to some extent mutation cysteine 84 (Cys84) contribute to oxyanion stabilization. We find that HG3.17 exhibits a rather high flexibility of Gln50, which is regulated by the conformation adopted by the active site residue tryptophan 44 (Trp44). This interplay between Gln50 and Trp44 positioning induced by distal active site mutations affects the water&#8208;mediated network of non&#8208;covalent interactions, Gln50 preorganization, and water content of the active site pocket.

         <title>Stepwise Construction of Supramolecular A2B4&#8208;Type Miktoarm Star Copolymers with a Cobalt Phthalocyanine Core</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 6, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;ligand coordination has been used to generate a supramolecular miktoarm star&#8208;shaped copolymer with a cobalt(II) phthalocyanine (CoPc) core. Stepwise axial coordination of the terminal pyridyl group of poly(methyl methacrylate) to the CoPc core of the four&#8208;armed, star&#8208;shaped polystyrene provided AB4&#8208; and A2B4&#8208;type microstars.







Abstract
Supramolecular interactions between polymers play a crucial role in the construction of three&#8208;dimensional polymer structures with unique physical and chemical properties. In this study, we have fabricated a novel supramolecular miktoarm star copolymer (&#956;&#8208;star) with a cobalt(II) phthalocyanine (CoPc) core using metal&#8208;ligand coordination. Axial coordination of the terminal pyridyl group of poly(methyl methacrylate) with the CoPc core of four&#8208;armed star&#8208;shaped polystyrene provided AB4&#8208; and A2B4&#8208;type &#956;&#8208;stars through stepwise complexation. The spin&#8208;coated polymer films from mixed solutions of CoPcPS4 and pyPMMA in 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 or 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 mass ratios exhibited phase&#8208;separated nanodomains with smooth surfaces. Supramolecular interactions in polymer systems provide a unique topology to polymers and affect their bulk morphology.

         <title>Metal Pyrazolyl&#8208;Diphosphonate Pillared Materials as Heterogeneous Catalysts in the Mukaiyama&#8208;Type Aerobic Olefin Epoxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 6, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coordination of the organic PZDP linker to alkaline earth or transition metals yields 2D&#8208;pillared metal phosphonate frameworks under solvothermal or hydrothermal conditions. The structures of the materials are determined and the catalytic performance of Co&#8208;PZDP is tested in the Mukaiyama olefin epoxidation, achieving high yields of the corresponding epoxides.







Abstract
The structural variability and chemical stability of metal phosphonates under harsh conditions are attractive attributes that have drawn considerable attention in recent years. As the need for more sustainable solutions rises, the demand for novel and tolerant materials also increases. Thus, herein we report, for the first time, the synthesis of a novel diphosphonic organic linker named pyrazole diphenyl phosphonate (PZDP), envisioning the fabrication of durable metal phosphonates. In view of this, a series of M&#8208;PZDP materials (M=Ca, Sr, Ba, Zn and Co) were synthesized employing either solvothermal or hydrothermal methods. The crystal structures of the Ca, Sr, Zn, and Co derivatives were determined revealing a 2D&#8208;pillared architecture. Zn&#8208;PZDP is an anionic framework with dimethylammonium cations. The Co&#8208;PZDP compound was tested as a heterogeneous catalyst in olefin epoxidation employing molecular oxygen.

         <title>Intersystem Crossing, Photo&#8208;Induced Charge Separation and Regioisomer&#8208;Specific Excited State Dynamics in Fully Rigid Spiro Rhodammine&#8208;Naphthalene/Anthraquinone Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Dyads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 6, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong dependence of photophysical properties on amino substitution positions of naphthalene chromophores was observed with two isomers. Long&#8208;lived charge separation state (&#964;CS=0.62&#8197;&#956;s) was observed with spiro fully rigid compact electron donor and acceptor orthogonal dyads using transient absorption spectra, and the triplet spin multiplicity of CS state is confirmed by time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectra.







Abstract
We prepared a series fully rigid spiro electron donor&#8208;acceptor orthogonal dyads, with closed form of rhodamine (Rho) as electron donor and naphthalene (Np)/anthraquinone (AQ) as electron acceptor, to access the long&#8208;lived triplet charge separation (3CS) state, via the electron spin control method. We found strong dependency of the photophysical property of the dyads on the amino substitution positions of the Np chromophores in the dyads 1,8&#8208;DaNp&#8208;Rho and 2,3&#8208;DaNp&#8208;Rho. Nanosecond transient absorption (ns&#8208;TA) spectra show the population of the 3LE state (lifetime: 47 &#956;s) for 2,3&#8208;DaNp&#8208;Rho, however, long&#8208;lived 3CS state was observed (&#964;CS=0.62&#8197;&#956;s) for AQ&#8208;Rho, with a CS quantum yield of &#934;CS=58&#8201;%. Based on femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) spectra, spin orbit charge transfer ISC (SOCT&#8208;ISC) is proposed to be responsible for the formation of the triplet states. Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectra of AQ&#8208;Rho indicate the presence of two states, a 3LE state with zero field splitting (ZFS) D parameter of 1400&#8197;MHz and E parameter of &#8722;410&#8197;MHz, formed via radical pair ISC (RP&#8208;ISC) and SOCT&#8208;ISC mechanism; and a 3CS state with the electron spin&#8208;spin interaction in the regime of spin&#8208;correlated radical pair (SCRP).

         <title>The Emissive and Electrochemical Properties of Hypervalent Pyridine&#8208;Dipyrrolide Bismuth Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 6, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report on hypervalent bismuth complexes, featuring ligands with the pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;bis(pyrrolide) motif. These complexes exhibit HOMO&#8594;LUMO transitions with ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal&#8208;charge transfer (LMCT) and interligand charge transfer (LL'CT) characteristics, as revealed by TD&#8208;DFT calculations. At 77&#8197;K, the complexes display red phosphorescence. Electrochemical and structural analyses demonstrate the influence of substituents on the electronic properties and the Lewis acidity of the Bi3+ ion.







Abstract
We present a series of six hypervalent bismuth complexes Bi(R1PDPR2)X bearing ligands characterized by the pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;bis(pyrrolide) (PDP) structural motif. While bismuth holds considerable potential for facilitating efficient intersystem crossing (ISC), reports on phosphorescent molecular bismuth complexes are still scarce and mostly based on systems that exhibit inter&#8208; or intraligand charge transfer character of their optical excitations. Herein, the UV/vis absorptive, luminescent, and electrochemical properties of complexes Bi(R1PDPR2)X are explored, where the substituents R1 and R2, as well as the halide ligand X are varied. These compounds are characterized by an intense HOMO&#8594;LUMO transition of mixed ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) and interligand charge transfer (LL'CT) character, as shown by time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations. At 77&#8197;K in a 2&#8208;MeTHF matrix, these compounds exhibit red, long&#8208;lived phosphorescence with lifetimes ranging from 479 to 14&#8197;&#956;s. Cyclic voltammetry measurements and TD&#8208;DFT calculations show that the substituents influence HOMO and LUMO energies to almost equal extent, resulting in nearly constant emission wavelengths throughout this series. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of four of the six complexes exemplify the inherent Lewis acidity of the coordinated Bi3+ ion, in spite of its hypervalency.

Reversing the Trend: Phenanthridine (benzo[c]quinoline) donors defy conventional logic that increasing ligand benzannulation leads to bathochromic (red) shifts in the absorption and emission of their coordination complexes. Here, we provide a counterfactual that reverses this trend: substitution at the phenanthridine 6&#8208;position (i.&#8201;e., at the C=N sub&#8208;unit) breaks the phenanthridine's tendency to cause hypsochromic luminescence shifts.







Abstract
Ligands containing phenanthridine (benzo[c]quinoline) have presented notable exceptions to the conventional logic that increasing ligand benzannulation leads to bathochromic (red) shifts in the absorption and emission of their coordination complexes. The counterintuitive blue shifts have been attributed to the peculiar structure of phenanthridines, whose ground states are dominated by imine&#8208;bridged biphenyl resonance contributors. These serve to isolate the C=N unit electronically from the rest of the ligand framework and allow the C=N moiety to act as a &#8216;shock&#8208;absorber&#8217;, buffering against larger molecular distortions in a molecule's excited state, and reducing the observed pseudo&#8208;Stokes&#8217; shift. Here, we provide experimental evidence for this assertion in the form of a counterfactual that reverses this trend: substitution at the phenanthridine 6&#8208;position (i.&#8201;e., at the C=N sub&#8208;unit) breaks the phenanthridine's tendency to cause hypsochromic luminescence shifts. The synthesis, full characterization, and comparison of 2&#8208;quinolinyl and 6&#8208;phenanthridinyl exemplars is provided, supported by a detailed theoretical treatment.

         <title>Highly Selective Cytokine Induction of Nitrated Lipid&#8208;Modified &#945;&#8208;GalCer Derivatives Demonstrating High Binding Affinity to the Lipid Antigen Presenting Molecule CD1d</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 6, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel &#945;&#8208;GalCer containing natural nitro&#8208;modified fatty acyl groups were synthesized and discovered to have highly selective Th2 and Th17 cytokine induction ability. The nitroalkene group of glycolipids at the CD1d binding site is inferred to interact with polar and aromatic amino acids, leading to a significant effect on the immunomodulatory functions.







Abstract
Glycolipid antigens are presented by CD1d on antigen&#8208;presenting cells to T cell receptors (TCRs) of natural killer T (NKT) cells, leading to immune responses via cytokine induction. Although various lipid antigens have been found, there are only a limited number of glycolipid antigens having selective cytokine induction. In this study, we identified the glycolipids (&#945;&#8208;GalCer nitro&#8208;type) that exhibit highly selective induction of Th2 and Th17 type cytokines, with very high binding affinity to CD1d, by introducing nature&#8208;inspired nitro&#8208;modified fatty acyl groups. The natural nitroalkene moiety of fatty acyl groups in the glycolipids effectively enhances the affinity to CD1d through presumed hydrogen&#8208;bonding and NO2&#8211;&#960; interactions, leading to the distinctive function in cytokine induction and selectivity.

A bis(triarylamine) radical cation bridged by two o&#8208;terphenylene moieties was prepared and characterized to explore the impact of the doubly &#960;&#8208;bridging on the intramolecular charge/spin transfer process in the 2&#8208;site organic mixed&#8208;valence system. Spectroscopic analyses on optically and thermally assisted intervalence charge&#8208;transfer processes revealed that the doubly &#960;&#8208;bridging enhanced the charge delocalization between two nitrogen redox&#8208;centers, whereas the electronic coupling was not so strengthened, in comparison with the singly &#960;&#8208;bridged reference compound.

         <title>Photoinduced Deprotection of 2&#8208;Nitrophenylneopentyl Glycol Boronates Enables Light&#8208;Triggered Polycondensation of Siloxanes</title>

Novel photolabile protecting groups for boronic and borinic acids were developed based on the 2&#8208;nitrobenzyl motif. The 1&#8208;(2&#8208;nitrophenyl)neopentyl glycol (npnp) diol, easily synthesized on a gram scale, enables the formation of stable boronates. Efficient deprotection of RB(npnp) was achieved by irradiation at 365&#8197;nm, which was applied in light&#8208;triggered siloxane crosslinking.







Abstract
Various protecting groups have been developed for boronic acids, mostly based on diols. Alternatives include trifluoroborates and amine complexes, which offer easier synthesis and release under milder conditions. We present here a new strategy involving photocleavable protecting groups for boronic and borinic acids, based on the 2&#8208;nitrobenzyl motif. A screening of several 1,2&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;diols bearing a 2&#8208;nitrobenzyl group led us to identify 1&#8208;(2&#8208;nitrophenyl)neopentyl glycol (npnp) for the protection of boronic acid derivatives. This diol is easily prepared in a single step on gram scale, and the corresponding npnp boronates are stable in wet acetonitrile at 90&#8201;&#176;C for several days, and under under acidic conditions. Irradiation at 365&#8197;nm in acetonitrile allows for the controlled liberation of boronic acids in good to excellent yields, a method also applied to a dimesitylborinic ester bearing a 2&#8208;nitrobenzylalcohol moiety. 1&#8208;(2&#8208;Nitrophenyl)neopentyl glycol boronates ArB(npnp) demonstrated their utility in light&#8208;triggered siloxane crosslinking. We showed that catalysts incorporated into a polymer matrix, irradiated, and then incubated at 50&#8201;&#176;C for 7&#8197;days resulted in efficient polymerization, forming solid materials in some cases.

We have introduced imidazo&#8208;[4,5&#8208;f][1,10]&#8208;phenanthroline&#8208;based Re(I) tricarbonyl complexes [Re(CO)3(N^N)Cl], which exhibit strong DNA intercalation and protein binding, enhanced photophysical properties, increased 3&#960;&#8208;&#960;* character for PDT, high lipophilicity for cell membrane penetration, higher phototoxicity against TNBC cells in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions by generating reactive oxygen species and releasing CO under light exposure.







Abstract
We have introduced Re(I) tricarbonyl complexes (ReL1 &#8208; ReL6) [Re(CO)3(N^N)Cl] where N^N=extensive &#960; conjugated imidazo&#8208;[4,5&#8208;f][1,10]&#8208;phenanthroline derivatives that helps in strong DNA intercalation, enhanced photophysical behavior, increase the 3&#960;&#8208;&#960;* character of T1 state for PDT and high value of lipophilicity for cell membrane penetration. These complexes exhibited prominent intraligand/ligand&#8208;centered (&#960;&#8208;&#960;*/1LC) absorption bands at &#955; 260&#8211;350&#8197;nm and relatively weak metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer (1MLCT) bands within the &#955; 350&#8211;550&#8197;nm range. Among the six synthesized complexes, [(CO)3ReICl(K2&#8208;N,N&#8208;2&#8208;(4&#8208;(1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;5&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazo[4,5&#8208;f][1,10]phenanthroline] (ReL6) exhibited outstanding potency (IC50~6&#8197;&#956;M, PI&gt;9) under yellow light irradiation compared to dark conditions. Importantly, extremely lipophilic complex ReL6 showed effective penetration through the cell membrane and localized primarily in mitochondria (Pearson's correlation coefficient, PCC=0.918) of MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells. Complex ReL6 exhibited more than 9&#8197;times higher photo&#8208;toxicity in normoxic and hypoxic environment of tumor by inducing 1O2 generation (type&#8197;II PDT), radical generation triggered by NADH oxidation (type&#8197;I PDT). This complex is a promising candidate for TNBC treatment in hypoxic tumors, with efficacy comparable to photofrin and have demonstrated CO release ability under UV light irradiation.

         <title>Organocatalytic Electrophilic Arene Amination: Rapid Synthesis of 2&#8208;Quinolones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 6, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fresh approach to 2&#8208;quinolone synthesis! This study presents an innovative organocatalytic electrophilic arene amination strategy, enabling the efficient synthesis of a diverse array of 2&#8208;quinolones &#8211; a critical scaffold with extensive industrial applications. By circumventing traditional metal&#8208;based catalysts, this approach paves the way for advancements in multiple sectors, offering a sustainable and versatile alternative.







Abstract
For decades, the synthesis of 2&#8208;quinolones, a crucial structural motif in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, has relied heavily on costly noble metal complexes and structurally complex ligands. Despite considerable efforts from synthetic chemists, a mild, metal&#8208;free, environmentally friendly, and cost&#8208;effective approach has remained elusive. This study introduces a robust, metal&#8208;free synthetic platform that leverages an innovative organoiodine&#8208;catalyzed electrophilic arene C(sp2)&#8722;H amination strategy to efficiently produce a wide range of new and modifiable 2&#8208;quinolones. Moreover, this study allows ready synthetic access to novel 8&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;quinolones, uncovering new chemical spaces with significant potential for medicinal applications.

Painting with new colors: In this work, proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) has been shown to be useful for the generation of unusual types of oxygen&#8208;bridged neptunium complexes. This suggests that tailored combinations of reductants and proton sources, like choosing colors when painting, may open up further new vistas of neptunium reactivity. Similarly, PCET appears poised to give the actinide chemist, as an artist, an exciting new type of brush for painting. More information can be found in the Research Article by E.&#8197;R. Mikeska, R.&#8197;E. Wilson and J.&#8197;D. Blakemore (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202402963).

         <dc:description>
Dispersion interactions serve as a driving force for ortho&#8208;lithiation: A significantly large and bulky substituent, rich in C&#8722;H bonds, attached to the pyridine nitrogen of 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine, strongly attracts the organolithium reagent through dispersion forces. This interaction is visualized as a black hole drawing the organolithium particle toward it. In contrast, simpler bulky substituents repel incoming organometallic reagents, diverting them to position&#8197;3 instead. This repulsion is metaphorically represented as a star emitting a particle outward. More information can be found in the Research Article by A.&#8197;S. Antonov and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202403422).

The featured complex, a ReI tricarbonyl compound with extensively &#960;&#8208;conjugated imidazo[4,5&#8208;f]1,10&#8208;phenanthroline derivatives helps DNA intercalation and exhibits higher phototoxicity against triple&#8208;negative breast cancer cells. Its potent anticancer activity is attributed to its ability to generate singlet oxygen (type&#8197;II PDT), catalyze radical formation through NADH oxidation (type&#8197;I PDT), disrupt glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis by triggering its conversion from GSH to GSSG, and release cytotoxic CO upon light irradiation. More information can be found in the Research Article by B. Kar and P. Paira (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202401720).

         <title>The Designs and Applications of Tetraphenylethylene Macrocycles and Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 6, January 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetraphenylethylene containing macrocycles and cages unite the aggregation&#8208;induced emission and supramolecular hosts into a single component, which makes them especially attractive functional molecules. With advanced synthesis strategies and self&#8208;assemblies, various complicated macrocycles and cages have been reported. Those unique compounds were attracting materials for sensing, imaging, catalysis, and many other applications.







Abstract
Macrocycles and cages are very attractive for the development of functional materials due to their unique inner cavities. Building blocks with interesting functions and synthetic conveniences are especially attractive. Tetraphenylethylene (TPE) is such an entity with C2 symmetry and tetrakis&#8208;functional groups easily modifiable. As a typical aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) active compound, TPE perfectly unites the functions of fluorescence and structural building blocks together. The unique marriage of the two roles into one component makes TPE an ideal platform for the development of functional molecular systems including macrocycles and cages. The TPE macrocycles and cages are not merely a simple combination of those two but also generate added values unseen in either component alone. The fluorescence properties of TPE in macrocycles/cages are greatly improved or modulated, which makes them more suitable for various applications compared to their linear counterparts. In this review, the chemistry and design principles of TPE macrocycles/cages are surveyed first. The unique properties of those compounds are also discussed to provide general guidance for their functionalization. A brief discussion of their applications focusing on the utilization of their unique fluorescence is also presented. In the last, outlooks and future perspectives of TPE macrocycles/cages are provided for further developments.

Photocatalytic hydrogen production is an effective and sustainable method to address the depletion and pollution of fossil fuels. This review fine tunes the structural composition by constructing monomers, functional groups, and metal hybridization for photocatalytic hydrogen production. A detailed correlation analysis and summary were conducted on the structural characteristics of porous frameworks and their photocatalytic ability.







Abstract
With the depletion of fossil fuels and increasing pollution problems, green and sustainable energy supply attracts worldwide attention. Hydrogen is a green and high&#8208;density energy substance, and photocatalytic hydrogen generation is an effective and sustainable method. Therefore, developing high&#8208;performance photocatalysts plays a crucial role in practical application. Porous frameworks with large surface areas and diversified structures are considered promising candidates for photocatalysts. This review summarizes the recent progress on porous frameworks and their derivatives through fine&#8208;tuning structural components in terms of building monomers, functional groups, and metal hybridization for photocatalytic production of hydrogen. A detailed correlation is conducted between the structural features of porous frameworks and photocatalysis capability. In addition, we summarized the advantages of porous materials for photocatalytic hydrogen production and future development.

         <title>Construction of Sub&#8208;nano Channels of&#160;Amino Pillar[6]arene Inspired Biomimetic Porous Roots for Specific Remove&#160;of Imazamox</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The root ducts play an important role in the plant's transport of nutrients from the soil. Based on the selective transport characteristics of plant roots, amino pillar[6]arene bionic porous root sub&#8208;nano channel&#160;membrane were&#160;constructed to&#160;remove Imazamox. Imazamox (IM) is an effective imidazolinone herbicide frequently utilized in soybean fields to control a wide range of annual grasses and broad&#8208;leaved weeds.&#160;However, it is important to note that while IM is effective in controlling the growth of weeds, its residues can affect the plants that are later planted.&#160;Developing a material that can efficiently and selectively remove IM from the environment poses a significant challenge in the realm of agricultural residue removal.&#160;A&#160;layer&#8208;upon&#8208;layer covalent assembly was formed&#160;through the reaction of amino pillar[6]arene with terephthalaldehyde using an aldehyde&#8208;amine Schiff&#8208;base reaction.&#160;The cavity of amino pillar[6]arenal is used to realize the host&#8208;guest interaction of IM. This enabled the development of a membrane with high selectivity for the extraction and removal of IM. The removal rate is 4.66&#8208;21.91 times higher than that of other pesticide chemicals. The successful development of the highly selective porous root bionic membrane provides a broad prospect for its application and development in agricultural production.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The discrete &#960;&#8208; stacks of specific lengths and orientation is crucial for understanding the impact of intermolecular interactions on optical or electronic properties of nanographdiynes. We designed and synthesized nanographdiynes modified with bulky rotatable asymmetric substituents. The peripheral substituents with different push&#8208;pull electronic properties can induce molecular dipoles perpendicular to nanoGDY &#960; surface with different orientation. Mediated by directional dipole&#8208;dipole interactions, o&#8208;TBGDY substituted with electron&#8208;donating tert&#8208;butylphenyl groups cofacially dimerized with a twist angle, involving intermolecular interlocking of ortho&#8208;substituted tert&#8208;butylphenyl groups. In contrast, OTFGDY substituted with electron&#8208;withdrawing trifluorophenyl groups formed dimeric H&#8208;aggregates with an in&#8208;plane shift along one diyne linkage, in which the ortho&#8208;substituted trifluorophenyl groups point toward the outside of the interacting &#960;&#8208;plane. o&#8208;TBGDY can only exist as isolated H&#8208;dimer in the solid state, while OTFGDY can form a hybrid tetramer of H&#8208; and J&#8208;aggregates. Our researches reveal a new method for preparing discrete &#960;&#8208;stacked dye assemblies with well&#8208;defined optoelectronic properties.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The self&#8208;assembly of block copolymers (BCPs) to form nanostructures of various morphologies and controllable dimensions has been a very promising research area in nanotechnology in recent decades. This review mainly summarizes the recent advances in precise and controllable self&#8208;assembly of BCPs through a tailored nucleation&#8208;growth strategy to modulate the self&#8208;assembly behavior of the BCPs. These efforts have led to a better understanding of the self&#8208;assembly mechanisms and opened new possibilities for creating novel materials with designable properties. We hope that the review is more than a periodical summary of previous research work and can provide valuable inspiration for the research field.</dc:description>

These efforts have led to a better understanding of the self-assembly mechanisms and opened new possibilities for creating novel materials with designable properties. We hope that the review is more than a periodical summary of previous research work and can provide valuable inspiration for the research field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Poly(1,3&#8208;dioxolane)&#8208;Modified Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 as the Electrolyte for Enhanced Solid Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (LATP) as the solid&#8208;electrolyte has attracted much attention for Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, the unstable LATP/Li interface and the insufficient contact between the anode/cathode and LATP usually lead to the structural collapse of LATP and the large solid&#8211;solid interfacial resistance for Li+ transport. Herein, a poly(1,3&#8208;dioxolane) (PDOL) adhesive layer was constructed by a Al(OTf)3&#8208;induced in&#8208;situ solidification process between the interface of LATP and anode/cathode. Such PDOL interfacial adhesive layer alleviates adverse reduction reactions at the LATP/Li interface and provides stable and well&#8208;contacted bilateral electrode interfaces. Benefitting from the PDOL interfacial adhesive, the Li|adhesive&#8208;LATP|Li symmetric cells achieve a current density up to 0.7 mA cm&#8208;2 and exhibit a good cycling stability for more than 2750 h at 0.1 mA cm&#8208;2, and the Li|adhesive&#8208;LATP|LiFePO4 solid&#8208;state batteries with interface modification exhibit a capacity of 158 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.2 C with a retention of 94% after 100 cycles.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Mechanochromic materials, known for their ability to change color in response to mechanical stimuli such as pressure, stretching, grinding, or rubbing, hold significant importance due to their diverse applications. In this study, we synthesized and characterized two novel pyridine&#8208;tethered imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine mechanoresponsive luminogens with appended tetraphenylethene, named GBY&#8208;10 and GBY&#8208;11. GBY&#8208;10 exhibited reversible mechanofluorochromism, while GBY&#8208;11 did not revert to its original color after solvent fuming. The photophysical properties of these luminogens were significantly influenced by the position of the terminal pyridine. Additionally, we created color&#8208;tunable mechanoresponsive molecular salts by co&#8208;grinding GBY&#8208;11 with various aryl acid derivatives. Co&#8208;grinding GBY&#8208;11 with pentafluorobenzoic acid resulted in a significant bathochromic shift of the emission maxima by 66 nm, compared to 37 nm and 12 nm shift for benzoic acid and para&#8208;nitrobenzoic acid, respectively. This counter&#8208;ion&#8208;dependent luminescence suggests strong electronic interactions between the counter ions. These luminogens also demonstrated reversible pH&#8208;responsive behaviour, making them suitable for anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications. Furthermore, the pyridine&#8208;functionalized luminogen, GBY&#8208;10, showed metal ion detection (Mn&#178;&#8314;, Ag&#8314;, Fe&#179;&#8314;) ability in water, with detection limits as low as 0.0043, 0.015, and 0.0029 mM, respectively. This report opens new avenues for designing promising AIE&#8208;active materials for potential applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting, sensing, optoelectronics, and biomedicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective and Divergent Synthesis of Naphthalene&#8208; and Phenanthrene&#8208;Fused Azahelicenes by Turning Rearrangement On or Off</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;substituents of the carbazoles control the rearrangement in the Scholl reaction of 3,6&#8208;bis{2&#8208;(2&#8208;naphthyl)phenyl}carbazoles and 3,6&#8208;bis{2&#8208;(9&#8208;phenanthrenyl)phenyl}carbazoles, allowing for the selective synthesis of naphthalene&#8208; and phenanthrene&#8208;fused azahelicenes. The reaction mechanisms on the divergent reaction pathways were investigated by DFT calculations, which well supported the experimental results.







Abstract
The Scholl reaction has been used to synthesize a variety of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, where 1,2&#8208;aryl shifts have sometimes occurred to yield unique rearrangement products. However, such 1,2&#8208;aryl shifts are often uncontrollable, and the selective and divergent synthesis with or without rearrangement is desired. Here, we achieved the control of the rearrangement in the Scholl reaction of carbazoles by changing the N&#8208;substituents. The Scholl reaction of 3,6&#8208;bis{2&#8208;(2&#8208;naphthyl)phenyl}carbazoles and 3,6&#8208;bis{2&#8208;(9&#8208;phenanthrenyl)phenyl}carbazoles with an N&#8208;benzyl group gave multiple azahelicenes via double rearrangement, while those with an N&#8208;benzoyl group gave aza[9]helicene and quadruple [4]helicene in the former and latter cases, respectively. The reaction mechanisms on the divergent reaction pathways were investigated by DFT calculations, which well supported the experimental results.

         <title>Fluorinated&#8208;Quinoxaline Based Non&#8208;Fused Electron Acceptors Enables Efficient As&#8208;Cast Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new nonfused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (NFREAs) namely L19 and L21 were designed and synthesized. Near 11.5&#8201;% binary as&#8208;cast device and approching 18&#8201;% ternary device efficiencies were achieved with single&#8208;junction solar cells based on electron acceptor of fluorinated L21.







Abstract
Non&#8208;fused electron acceptors have obtained increasing curiosity in organic solar cells (OSCs) thanks to simple synthetic route and versatile chemical modification capabilities. However, non&#8208;fused acceptors with varying quinoxaline core and as&#8208;cast device have rarely been explored, and the molecular structure&#8208;photovoltaic performance relationship of such acceptors remains unclear. Herein, two non&#8208;fused acceptors L19 and L21 with thienyl substituted non&#8208;fluorinated/fluorinated quinoxaline core were developed via five&#8208;step synthesis. Compared with L19, L21 with F&#8208;containing quinoxaline exhibited higher molar extinction coefficient, boosted charge mobility, improved exciton dissociation, more ordered molecular stacking and optimized film morphology. Thereafter, a notable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.45&#8201;% could be obtained for the as&#8208;cast PBDB&#8208;T&#8201;:&#8201;L21 &#8208;based device, which is significantly better than the device based on PBDB&#8208;T&#8201;:&#8201;L19 (8.68&#8201;%). Furthermore, PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6&#8201;:&#8201;L21&#8208;based ternary devices were fabricated and exhibited the highest PCE of 17.81&#8201;%. This work discloses that the introduction of electron&#8208;withdrawing fluorinated quinoxaline core and appropriate side&#8208;chain engineering can play an important role in improving the performance of as&#8208;cast solar cell devices.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Monosubstituted [n]Paracyclophane using a Desymmetrization/Kinetic Resolution Sequence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective synthesis of monosubstituted [n]paracyclophanes enabled by Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond olefination of prochiral cyclophanes is discussed. The protocol combines desymmetrization and kinetic resolution, where desymmetrization is a key contributor to enantiocontrol and kinetic resolution enhances enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Optically pure monosubstituted [n]paracyclophanes are promising candidates for material synthesis, asymmetric catalysis, and drug discovery. Thus far, only a few catalytic asymmetric synthesis processes have been reported for assessing these strained atropisomers. In this study, we describe a highly enantioselective synthesis of monosubstituted [n]paracyclophanes by combining desymmetrization and kinetic resolution. The proposed protocol involves Pd&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective C&#8722;H bond olefination enabled by a monoprotected amino acid ligand, which affords a variety of monosubstituted [n]paracyclophanes with excellent enantioselectivity (&#8805;99&#8201;%ee). Thermodynamic experiments are conducted to investigate the racemization barrier. The synthesized monosubstituted [n]paracyclophanes exhibit vivid fluorescence and impressive circularly polarized luminescence. Further, the emission color and dissymmetry factor can be tuned and controlled by switching the substituent on the benzene ring of the cyclophanes.

&lt;p&gt;Optically pure monosubstituted [&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;]paracyclophanes are promising candidates for material synthesis, asymmetric catalysis, and drug discovery. Thus far, only a few catalytic asymmetric synthesis processes have been reported for assessing these strained atropisomers. In this study, we describe a highly enantioselective synthesis of monosubstituted [&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;]paracyclophanes by combining desymmetrization and kinetic resolution. The proposed protocol involves Pd-catalyzed atroposelective C&#8722;H bond olefination enabled by a monoprotected amino acid ligand, which affords a variety of monosubstituted [&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;]paracyclophanes with excellent enantioselectivity (&#8805;99&#8201;%&lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;). Thermodynamic experiments are conducted to investigate the racemization barrier. The synthesized monosubstituted [&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;]paracyclophanes exhibit vivid fluorescence and impressive circularly polarized luminescence. Further, the emission color and dissymmetry factor can be tuned and controlled by switching the substituent on the benzene ring of the cyclophanes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Panchromatic Absorption of Unsymmetrical Donor&#8208;Acceptor Dyes Based on a Meta&#8208;Conjugated 1,3,5&#8208;Heteroaryltriazine Core</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Little explored are 1,3,5&#8208;triazine cores that are substituted with three different heteroaromatic groups despite their distinct optical and electronic properties. 1,3,5&#8208;Triazines substituted with strong donor and acceptor thiophenes give rise to long wavelength absorption tails due to intramolecular charge transfer absorptions of the meta&#8208;conjugated donor and acceptor groups. Some derivatives display mesomorphism without the aid of flexible side&#8208;chains.







Abstract
Attachment of three different heterocycles with electron donor or acceptor character to a central 1,3,5&#8208;triazine core generates readily soluble side&#8208;chain free dyes with two displaying soft crystalline mesomorphism and one displaying a nematic liquid crystal phase as confirmed by polarized optical microscopy, calorimetry, gravimetric analysis, and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction. Equally intriguing is the dyes&#8217; relatively strong electronic communication between donor and acceptor subchromophores that are meta&#8208;conjugated to one another, which is experimentally observed as a broad intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer absorption that can extend over 100&#8197;nm past the most intense absorption event and is computationally confirmed through density functional theory (DFT) evaluations of the molecular ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state properties. This molecular design permits the preparation of dyes with panchromatic absorption not just based on the additive absorption of individual subchromophores.

         <title>Discovery of 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazin&#8208;5&#8208;one Derivative CJ1&#8208;34 as a Partial ATP Synthase Inhibitor for CNS Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>ATP synthase dysregulation has been implicated in many diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Whilst ATP synthase&#8208;targeting compounds have been reported, most are large or polar compounds and lack appropriate properties for a CNS drug. We designed, synthesised, and evaluated a novel series of ATP synthase targeting compounds, resulting in a 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazin&#8208;5&#8208;one scaffold with improved physiochemical properties. In vitro evaluation of our library led to the discovery of CJ1 34 as a partial ATP synthase inhibitor with a determined IC50 of 394 nM in isolated bovine mitochondria. Molecular docking experiments demonstrated that calculated docking scores aligned with the observed in vitro pharmacology and supports the F1 region of the ATP synthase as the potential binding site. Overall, this provides the foundation to further investigate CJ1&#8208;34 as a potential CNS drug for diseases where mitochondria are implicated, including Alzheimer&#8217;s and Parkinson&#8217;s disease.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;molecule Magnet Properties of Silole&#8208; and Stannole&#8208;ligated Erbium Cyclo&#8208;octatetraenyl Sandwich Complexes</title>

         <dc:description>The synthesis, structures and magnetic properties of an &#951;5&#8208;silole complex and an &#951;5&#8208;stannole complex of erbium are reported. The sandwich complex anions [(&#951;5&#8208;CpSi)Er(&#951;8&#8208;COT)]&#8211; and [(&#951;5&#8208;CpSn)Er(&#951;8&#8208;COT)]&#8211;, where CpSi is [SiC4&#8208;2,5&#8208;(SiMe3)2&#8208;3,4&#8208;Ph2]2&#8211; (1Si), CpSn is [SnC4&#8208;2,5&#8208;(SiMe3)2&#8208;3,4&#8208;Me2]2&#8211; (1Sn) and COT = cyclo&#8208;octatetraenyl, were obtained as their [K(2.2.2&#8208;cryptand)]+ salts and found to be isostructural, with remarkably similar bond lengths and angles, differing only in the lengths of the Er&#8211;E interactions (E = Si, Sn). The parallels in the molecular structures of 1Si and 1Sn are reflected in their dynamic magnetic properties, which show single&#8208;molecule magnet behaviour in zero applied field, with effective energy barriers of 115 &#177; 7 and 125 &#177; 3 cm&#8211;1, respectively, along with comparable magnetic relaxation times. Analysis of the two complexes using ab initio calculations reveals differences at a quantitative level, but overall similar electronic structures, with the thermally activated relaxation likely to proceed via the first&#8208;excited Kramers doublet. Comparing 1Si and 1Sn with the previously reported germanium analogue 1Ge reveals that swapping one heavier group 14 element for another in complexes of the type [(&#951;5&#8208;CpE)Er(&#951;8&#8208;COT)]&#8211; has a minimal impact on the SMM behaviour.</dc:description>

         <title>Global and Local Shielding/Deshielding Variation in C60 and C70 Fullerenes Upon Reduction: Evaluation of Aromaticity, 13C&#8208;NMR and Anisotropy Patterns</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fullerenes are statically pleasant species featuring symmetric cages, which can be modified upon reduction. Here, we theoretically account for the variation of 13C&#8208;NMR patterns in C60 and C70 upon six&#8208;fold reduction and the overall variation of the enabled shielding/deshielding regions induced by &#960; and &#963; electrons according to different orientations of the external field and the related anisotropy. Our results show a significant modification of the chemical shift given by the main variation of the &#963;33 (or &#948;33) shielding component under the principal axis system (PAS) of the chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) at the representative carbon nucleus. For C606&#8208; a shielding cone property is enabled from any orientation, accounting for a significant spherical aromatic character. In contrast, in C706&#8209;, a shielding cone is reserved only for an axial&#8208;oriented field, with a deshielding cone behavior obtained from the complementary equatorial orientations. The overall anisotropy shows an inner isotropic region for C60 and C606&#8208;, with a continuous anisotropic outer contour for the latter. In contrast, C70 and C706&#8208; both show larger anisotropies, given the lesser spherical shape in addition to the modified &#960;&#8208;surface. Such information is useful for further rationalizing the implementation of magnetic anisotropic molecular devices into fullerene&#8208;based materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Homogeneous Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution in a Binuclear Bio&#8208;inspired Ni&#8208;Ni Complex Bearing Phenanthroline and Sulfidophenolate Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The prominence of binuclear&#160;catalysts underlines the need for the design and development of diverse bifunctional ligand frameworks that exhibit tunable electronic and structural properties. Such strategies enable metal&#8208;metal and ligand&#8208;metal cooperation towards catalytic applications, improve catalytic activity, and are essential for advancing multi&#8208;electron transfers for catalytic application. Hereby, we present the synthesis, crystal structure, and photocatalytic properties of a binuclear Ni(II) complex, [Ni2(1,10&#8208;phenanthroline)2(2&#8208;sulfidophenolate)2] (1), which&#160;crystallizes in the centrosymmetric triclinic system (P&#8208;1) showing extensive intra&#8208; and inter&#8208; non&#8208;coordinated interactions.&#160; The&#160; catalytic efficiency of 1 in a noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free photo&#8208;driven system using fluorescein as photosensitizer and triethanolamine as the electron donor, reaches TON 2900, threefold the efficiency of the corresponding homoleptic mononuclear complex [Ni(2&#8208;sulfidophenolate)2]. Efficiency rises up to 9000 TONs when thioglycolic&#8208;coated CdTe quantum dots are used as photosensitizers in the presence of ascorbic acid at pH 4.5.&#160;UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, DLS techniques, and Hg&#8208;poisoning measurements reveal that 1 maintains its molecular structure during catalysis. Electrochemical studies in DMF with TFA as the proton source were also performed for the elucidation of the mechanism of its catalytic action and its stability, suggesting that the proximity of two nickel ions plays a part in the increased catalytic activity, facilitating hydrogen evolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric de novo Synthesis of Chiral Pyrroles through Desymmetrizing Oxidative [3+2]&#8208;Cycloaddition and the Van Leusen Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Central chirality in heteroarene derivatives arising from unsymmetrically substituted heteroarene rings is an intriguing but underexplored topic. Herein, we reported the first catalytic enantioselective de novo construction of centrally chiral pyrroles through desymmetrizing oxidative [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition by employing silver catalysis. This judicious desymmetrization can produce at least four continuous stereogenic centers without creating any additional stereocenter. Furthermore, to introduce a more diverse set of substituents, we developed the first catalytic asymmetric Van Leusen reaction with &#945;&#8211;substituted TosMIC for the synthesis of centrally chiral pyrroles. A wide range of polycyclic 2&#8208;substituted, 3,4&#8208;fused pyrroles were obtained in high yields and with good to high enantioselectivities. This report includes the elaboration of methanobenzo[f]isoindole to synthetically challenging building block chiral isoindole compounds, which are synthesized enantioselectively for the first time.</dc:description>

         <title>Sheets Copper&#8208;Cobalt Graphitic Carbon Nitride Dual Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for the Epoxidation of Styrene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We pioneered a one&#8208;step synthesis of sheets S&#8722;Cu/Co&#8208;g&#8208;C3N4 dual single&#8208;atom by employing folding fan&#8208;shaped aluminum foil as a template, wherein Cu and Co single atoms were stabilized on g&#8208;C3N4 via N coordination. Subsequently, it was verified that the as&#8208;synthesized S&#8722;Cu/Co&#8208;g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;1:1 exhibited an excellent catalytic effect in the epoxidation of styrene.







Abstract
Dual single&#8208;atom catalysts have attracted considerable research interest due to their higher metal atom loading and more flexible active sites compared to single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). We pioneered the one&#8208;step synthesis of sheets copper&#8208;cobalt graphitic carbon nitride dual single&#8208;atom (S&#8722;Cu/Co&#8208;g&#8208;C3N4) using folding fan&#8208;shaped aluminum foil as a template, and used them as catalysts in the epoxidation of styrene respectively. Through XAFS (X&#8208;ray Absorption Fine Structure) and other characterizations, it is found that Cu and Co single atoms are stabilized separately on g&#8208;C3N4 via coordination with nitrogen (N), hindered the ordered growth of sheets, and formed more pore structures, which not only increased more catalytically active sites, but also effectively prevented the flakes re&#8208;aggregate during the catalytic process. And the synergistic effect between Cu and Co changes the energy band structure of the material and facilitates electron transfer during catalysis, hence an excellent catalytic effect of 89&#8201;% styrene conversion and 85&#8201;% styrene oxide selectivity was achieved when S&#8722;Cu/Co&#8208;g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;1&#8201;:&#8201;1 was applied in the epoxidation of styrene. Furthermore, the mechanisms of the epoxidation of styrene with S&#8722;Cu/Co&#8208;g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;1&#8201;:&#8201;1 was probed by the density functional theory (DFT) based on the slab model.

         <title>Mechanically Adaptive Materials based on Dynamic Chemical Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adaptiveness is an important feature for biological creatures to survive and interact with variable environments. Mechanically adaptive polymers (MAPs), which have been developed recently inspired by this adaptive nature, can regulate their mechanical properties in response to external stimuli or environmental changes. Specifically, MAPs based on dynamic chemical bonds have been synthesized and reported as an emerging material because of the intrinsic self&#8208;adaptability, outstanding mechanical properties and durable applications. This review primarily focuses on the recent advancements in the fabrication of MAPs through the utilization of dynamic covalent bonds and non&#8208;covalent bonds. A comprehensive summary of the methodologies and mechanisms employed to attain high energy dissipation in MAPs is provided. Subsequently, the review offers incisive analyses of the intrinsic functionalities of MAPs, such as high impact&#8208;stiffening, damping, and buffering capabilities. Finally, the developmental achievements within this domain are recapitulated, the potential challenges, and future research perspectives in MAPs are deliberated.</dc:description>

         <title>Two Consecutive Pathways Competing for Supramolecular Polymerization of Naphthalene&#8208;diimide Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The final outcomes of supramolecular assembly are determined by the pathways and the formation of intermediates during the assembly process. We studied pathway complexity involving two consecutive pathways in supramolecular polymerization of naphthalene&#8208;diimide (NDI) derivative molecule. Depending on preparation methods anisotropic aggregates of J&#8208;type nanorods (Agg I) or more flexible H&#8208;type nanofibers (Agg II) are obtained from the identical initial state in solution of methyl cyclohexane (MCH) or MCH/CHCl3 mixtures. More interestingly intermediate aggregates driven by intra&#8208;molecular hydrogen&#8208;bonds are observed by spectroscopy and imaging techniques for both pathways. Thermodynamic model&#8208;fitting suggest that both pathways are consecutive ones with intermediate aggregates. Combining density functional theory (DFT) calculation results, we propose the molecular packing of Agg I and II. Our results reveal comprehensive pathway complexity in self&#8208;assembly of molecules as simple as NDI.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Modification and Labeling of Native RNA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ribonucleic acid (RNA) plays a pivotal role in regulating biological processes within living systems, with modified nucleosides serving as critical modulators of various aspects of biological functions. Therefore, the development of efficient methodologies for late&#8208;stage, site&#8208;selective RNA modification is of considerable interest, as it facilitates the functional exploration of RNA chemical modifications and their implications for therapeutic applications. Precise RNA modification holds significant promise for the treatment of genetic diseases by enabling the correction of mutated nucleobases to their wild&#8208;type forms. Additionally, the site&#8208;selective incorporation of synthetic labeling groups into RNA provides invaluable tools for structural and functional studies, thereby uncovering previously hidden dimensions of RNA's role in biological systems. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of three principal approaches to site&#8208;selective, late&#8208;stage RNA modifications: enzyme&#8208;mediated strategies, catalytic nucleic acid&#8208;based techniques, and chemical methodologies. These approaches predominantly target the nucleobase or the 2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxyl (2&#8217;&#8208;OH) group of RNA nucleosides. We evaluate the advantages and limitations of each strategy and discuss future directions for advancing this field of research.</dc:description>

         <title>Colorimetric Detection of Naphthalene Enabled by Intra&#8208; to Intermolecular Charge Transfer Interplay Induced by &#960;&#8208;hole&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; Interactions of a TPA&#8208;Attached Pyrazinacene</title>

         <dc:description>A new Donor&#8208;Acceptor type pyrazinacene derivative (1) featuring strong ICT was synthesized by linking electron&#8208;donating triphenylamine (TPA) and electron&#8208;accepting CN groups via a pyrazinacene core. The compound exhibits a dramatic color change from greenish blue to red&#8208;violet upon selective recognition of naphthalene (3) to form a 1:1 co&#8208;crystal (1&#8226;3). This color change is induced by intermolecular CT between pyrazinacene and naphthalene&#8217;s aromatic moieties, driven by &#960;&#8208;hole&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions. Crystal structure analysis and DFT calculations confirm that the molecular recognition process is facilitated by the unique &#960;&#8208;hole&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions, leading to a reversible color switching mechanism. The findings offer new insights into selective molecular recognition and ICT&#8208;CT interplay in nonporous adaptive crystals.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In order to examine the effects of the fused heterole on the electronic properties of aromatic and antiaromatic smaragdyrins, 2,3&#8208;thiophene&#8208; and 2,3&#8208;indole&#8208;fused [20]smaragdyrins were synthesized by Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling and subsequent oxidative fusion reaction, and were reduced with NaBH4 to the corresponding [22]smaragdyrins. Fused&#8208;thiophene&#8208; and fused&#8208;pyrrole&#8208;bridged [20]&#8208; and [22]smaragdyrin dimers were also synthesized in the similar manner. The installed fused heteroles mitigate the paratropic ring current of the [20]smaragdyrin but exert only minor effects on the diatropic ring current of the [22]smaragdyrin.

         <title>Recent progress of mechanofluorochromism and mechanoluminescence for phenothiazine derivatives and analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanofluorochromism (MFC) and mechanoluminescence (ML) materials have garnered significant attention from researchers due to their potential applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting, optical recording, photodynamic therapy, bioimaging, stress sensing, display technology, and ink&#8208;free printing paper. Among the various building blocks utilized in these materials, phenothiazine (PTZ) has emerged as a widely employed fundamental component owing to its distinctive electronic and optical properties as well as its facile modification capabilities. Summarizing the recent progress of PTZ derivatives and analogues in this field holds practical significance. In this review article, we classify over one hundred compounds into few classes based on the positions of substituents and provide detailed descriptions of their contributions to MFC and ML research respectively. This comprehensive review aims to offer theoretical insights and practical examples for researchers engaged in designing and developing new phenothiazine functional materials while serving as a bridge for further exploration of MFC or ML studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactions of Tertiary Aliphatic Cations with Silylated Alkynes: Substitution, Cyclization and Unexpected C&#8208;H Activation Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Capozzi's groundbreaking work in 1982 introduced a fascinating reaction involving highly reactive tertiary aliphatic cations and silylated alkynes. This reaction provided an innovative solution to the challenge of coupling a fully substituted tertiary aliphatic fragment with an alkyne moiety. Building upon Capozzi's pioneering efforts, we started an extensive exploration of reaction conditions to expand the initial scope of this reaction. Through meticulous control of the reaction parameters, we uncovered conditions capable of accommodating various functional groups, thereby enhancing the reaction's applicability. Intriguingly, our study revealed remarkable high diastereoselectivities for substrates with substitution in the a&#8209;position. Additionally, we made an unexpected discovery: an intriguing C&#8208;H activation of a cyclooctane ring furnishing a cyclooctane&#8208;fused cyclobutene. These findings not only extend the utility of Capozzi's original concept but also underscore the potential of highly reactive cations &#160;in modern organic C&#8208;H activation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling the J&#8208; and H&#8208;Aggregates and Supramolecular Polymerization Pathways of Anthanthrene by Tuning the Hydrogen Bonding Sites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploration of new &#960;&#8208;conjugated building blocks for construction of supramolecular polymers is at the forefront of self&#8208;assembly. Herein, we incorporate a highly planar anthanthrene skeleton into the design of two supramolecular monomers 1 and 2. Their supramolecular polymerization have been comprehensively investigated by spectroscopic studies. Our results reveal that the number and/or position of the amide groups exert pronounced effect on the molecular aggregations and the mechanisms of the supramolecular polymerization. Monomer 1 self&#8208;assembles in a cooperative manner to form 1D nanofibers though face&#8208;to&#8208;face H&#8208;type aggregation. In contrast, 2 adopts J&#8208;aggregation to form supramolecular polymer via isodesmic mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Alternative and Sustainable Route to Explore a New Class of Amidines by Photochemical Synergistic Effect of Copper/Nitroxyl Radical Catalysis via Halogen&#8208;Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amidines are a vital class of bioactive compounds and often necessitate multiple components for their synthesis. Therefore, exploring efficient and sustainable methodologies for their synthesis is indispensable. Herein, we disclose an alternative and greener method for synthesizing an unexplored new class of amidines through the photochemical synergistic effect of copper/nitroxyl radical catalysis. This approach facilitates site&#8208;selective radical amination of unactivated imine C(sp2)&#8208;H bond in C,N,N&#8208;cyclic imines over favored selectivity via halogen&#8208;atom transfer (XAT). This greener method ticks 11 out of 12 green chemistry metrics (GCM), effectively sidestepping the need for oxidants, bases, ligands, multistep processes, and harsh conditions, distinguishing it from conventional methods described in previous studies. Kinetic, spectroscopic, and computational tools have been employed to elucidate the synergistic effect of Cu/nitroxyl radical, the role of light, XAT, the influence of substituents, and the order of the reaction in the catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;healing behavior of metallopolymers in complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This current study focusses on the investigation of the self&#8208;healing abilities of metallopolymers containing different kinds of metal complexes, which were processed by direct digital light processing (DLP) based three&#8208;dimensional (3D) printing. For this purpose, 2&#8209;phenoxyethyl acrylate is mixed with ligand&#8208;containing monomers either based on triphenylmethyl(trt)&#8208;histidine or terpyridine, respectively. Either zinc(II) or nickel(II) salts are successfully applied for a complexation of the ligand monomers in solution and, subsequently, photopolymerization is performed. The thermo&#8208;mechanical properties of the obtained metallopolymers were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) as well as&#160;dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). Multiple damages with defined forces ranging from 20 to 1500 mN were introduced into the 3D&#8208;structures and successfully healed within 24&#160;h at 70&#160;&#176;C or 120&#160;&#176;C, respectively without losing the structural integrity of the overall 3D&#8208;structures. Herein, excellent healing efficiencies up to 97% were determined. Consequently, these hollow structures not only feature very good self&#8208;healing abilities but also excellent retention of the 3D&#8208;structure at and above the healing temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>In situ Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Investigation of Isotope&#8208;selective Breathing in MIL&#8208;53 during Dihydrogen Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of smart materials capable of separating dihydrogen isotopologues has risen recently. Among potential candidates, the flexible MIL&#8208;53 (Al) has been gaining attention due to its structural flexibility providing the so&#8208;called &#8216;&#8217;breathing mechanism&#8217;&#8217; that can be useful to separate hydrogen isotopologues selectively. In the present work, an in situ continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance investigation has been proven as a sensitive technique to follow the isotopologue&#8208;selective adsorption&#8208;desorption of dihydrogen species on the paramagnetic metal&#8208;doped MIL&#8208;53 (Al0.99Cr0.01) and MIL&#8208;53 (Al0.99V0.01), respectively. The presence of paramagnetic spin probes such as Cr3+ and V4+ inside the MIL&#8208;53 framework allows for monitoring the framework transition including the 2nd transition step that selectively occurs at p &gt; 100 mbar when D2 gas is adsorbed on the pores at 23 K. Furthermore, investigation of D2 desorption from MIL&#8208;53 (Al0.99V0.01) by temperature&#8208;dependent hyperfine spectroscopy provides a more detailed analysis of the D2 desorption process on a microscopic scale with respect to the embedded spin probe.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced K&#8208;storage kinetics for N&#8208;doped carbon via controllable dedoping strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a potential alternative to next&#8208;generation LIBs, carbonous materials have garnered significant attention as anode materials for potassium&#8208;ion batteries due to their low cost and environmental friendliness. However, carbonaceous materials cannot fulfill the demand of anode for PIBs, due to volume expansion and poor stability during charging/discharging process. It is well&#8208;known that N doping can provide active sites for K&#8208;storage, and expand the layer distance between graphite layers. Therefore, a simple one&#8208;step pyrolysis strategy was proposed to synthesize different nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon to investigate the effects of N&#8208;doping and dedoping on K&#8208;storage performance. Through the synergistic action of N&#8208;doping and the carbon vacancy defects formed during the de&#8208;doping process, which alleviated volume expansion and promoted K+ transport rate. As a result, the PNC demonstrate excellent electrochemical performance, showing good long&#8208;term cycling stability (with a capacity of 195 mAh/g after 300 cycles at a current density of 200 mA/g) and outstanding rate performance. These findings provide valuable insights for the design and development of advanced anode materials with efficient potassium ion storage capabilities.</dc:description>

         <title>Benzo&#8208;Fused Phosphepines: Synthesis by Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Hydroarylation and Ring Inversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular hydroarylation of dialkynyl(biaryl)phosphine oxides provided versatile benzo&#8208;fused phosphepine oxides. O&#8208;exo adducts were obtained as the major product, and O&#8208;endo adducts were the minor product. O&#8208;exo and O&#8208;endo indicate the position of an oxygen atom with respect to the central phosphepine framework. The isomers of dibenzo[b,d]phosphepine oxides with methyl and phenyl groups in an adjacent position (shown as 2a and 3a in the main text) were determined by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. O&#8208;exo and O&#8208;endo adducts are diastereomers owing to the central chirality of the phosphorus atom and the planar chirality of phosphepine, and they are interconverted through a ring inversion of phosphepine via a transition state with a planar structure. The inversion barrier, fully estimated through theoretical calculations, drastically&#160;varied depending on the substituents in the phosphepine framework and/or the fusion of benzene and thiophene rings. Furthermore, the kinetics of the thermal isomerization of less stable O&#8208;endo product 3a into O&#8208;exo product 2a was examined.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorinated Macrocycle for Adsorptive Separation and Chromatographic Separation of Toluene and Methylcyclohexane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving the adsorptive separation and chromatographic separation of industrially the important chemicals toluene and methylcyclohexane using the same material is a highly desirable goal. We have successfully accomplished this using a fluorinated macrocycle tetrafluoroterphen[3]arene (4FTP3), which was synthesized and used for gas chromatographic separation in our previous work. The macrocycle 4FTP3 permitted the adsorptive separation of toluene from a toluene/methylcyclohexane mixture (1:1, v/v) with a purity of 99.3% in a single adsorption cycle. Additionally, the use of 4FTP3 as a gas chromatographic stationary phase permitted the high&#8208;resolution separation of a toluene/methylcyclohexane mixture, with a retention capacity decreasing in the order of: toluene&gt;methylcyclohexane. Single&#8208;crystal structural analysis revealed that the C&#8211;H&#183;&#183;&#183;F interactions between 4FTP3 and toluene resulted in an enhanced binding affinity, association enthalpy, and longer retention time for toluene. This macrocycle is of particular interest for use as a separation material due to its simultaneous adsorptive separation and gas chromatographic separation of toluene/methylcyclohexane. The present fluorinated macrocycle may therefore have roles to play in both analytical science and the chemical industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Tolane&#8208;Based Phosphino&#8208; and Arsino&#8208;Ruthenium Complexes in Three Different Oxidation States: Ru(I), Ru(II) and Ru(III)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ruthenium(II) complexes featuring iPr2P&#8208; and iPr2As&#8208;functionalized diphenylacetylene scaffolds were examined with respect to 1e&#8722; reduction and oxidation. An octahedral ruthenium(III) complexes was obtained for the iPr2As&#8208;functionalized ligand and a square&#8208;planar ruthenium(I) complex was isolated for the phospha&#8208;derivative. The latter ruthenium(I) complex was found to react with TlPF6 to produce a trinuclear species containing a nearly linear Ru&#8722;Tl&#8722;Ru moiety.







Abstract
Targeting Ru(III) and Ru(I) &#951;2&#8208;alkyne species, 2,2&#8217;&#8208;(iPr2E)2&#8208;substituted diphenylacetylenes (1&#8208;E, E=P, As) were employed for the preparation of [ECCE]&#8208;coordinated ruthenium complexes. The reactions between 1&#8208;E and cis&#8208;(MeCN)2(COD)RuCl2 led to the required Ru(II) starting materials cis&#8208;[ECCE]RuCl2(MeCN) (3&#8208;E). Upon oxidation of 3&#8208;E with PhICl2, the Ru(III) target complexes [ECCE]RuCl3 (7&#8208;E) were detectable for E=P and E=As, but only the arsa&#8208;derivative 7&#8208;As was obtained in a pure form, namely via oxidation of cis&#8208;[AsCCAs]RuCl2(THT) (THT=tetrahydrothiophene). Upon reduction of compounds 3&#8208;E, a hitherto unprecedented Ru(I) &#951;2&#8208;alkyne complex, [PCCP]RuCl (9), was obtained for E=P. The former square planar Ru(I) complex (9) was characterized comprehensively and examined in detail by means of DFT and CASSCF calculation. Upon treatment of 9 with TlPF6, a diamagnetic &#956;&#8208;Tl&#8208;bridged compound (10) with a nearly linear Ru&#8722;Tl&#8722;Ru array was formed and isolated in high yields. Careful analysis of the bonding situation suggested that the Ru&#8722;Tl&#8722;Ru moiety in 10 is best interpreted in terms of a 3c&#8211;4e&#8722; bond.

&lt;p&gt;Ruthenium(II) complexes featuring &lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P- and &lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;As-functionalized diphenylacetylene scaffolds were examined with respect to 1e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; reduction and oxidation. An octahedral ruthenium(III) complexes was obtained for the &lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;As-functionalized ligand and a square-planar ruthenium(I) complex was isolated for the phospha-derivative. The latter ruthenium(I) complex was found to react with TlPF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; to produce a trinuclear species containing a nearly linear Ru&#8722;Tl&#8722;Ru moiety.

The reactions between &lt;b&gt;1-E&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-(MeCN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(COD)RuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; led to the required Ru(II) starting materials &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-[ECCE]RuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(MeCN) (&lt;b&gt;3-E&lt;/b&gt;). Upon oxidation of &lt;b&gt;3-E&lt;/b&gt; with PhICl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the Ru(III) target complexes [ECCE]RuCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;7-E&lt;/b&gt;) were detectable for E=P and E=As, but only the &lt;i&gt;arsa&lt;/i&gt;-derivative &lt;b&gt;7-As&lt;/b&gt; was obtained in a pure form, namely via oxidation of &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-[AsCCAs]RuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(THT) (THT=tetrahydrothiophene). Upon reduction of compounds &lt;b&gt;3-E&lt;/b&gt;, a hitherto unprecedented Ru(I) &lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-alkyne complex, [PCCP]RuCl (&lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;), was obtained for E=P. The former square planar Ru(I) complex (&lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;) was characterized comprehensively and examined in detail by means of DFT and CASSCF calculation. Upon treatment of &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt; with TlPF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, a diamagnetic &lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;-Tl-bridged compound (&lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt;) with a nearly linear Ru&#8722;Tl&#8722;Ru array was formed and isolated in high yields. Careful analysis of the bonding situation suggested that the Ru&#8722;Tl&#8722;Ru moiety in &lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt; is best interpreted in terms of a 3&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;4&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Tetrylenes are Able to Discern between Isomeric Structures of Unsaturated Osmium(IV) Polyhydrides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexahydride OsH6(PiPr3)2 releases H2 to form two isomers of general formula OsH4(PiPr3)2, which are selectively trapped with the tetrylenes Ge{N(SiMe3)2}2 and Sn{N(SiMe3)2}2, there being a direct relationship between the size of the ligand donor atom (Ge vs Sn) and the trapped isomer. Ge{N(SiMe3)2}2 generates OsH4{Ge[N(SiMe3)2]2}(PiPr3)2 which has a piano stool geometry, while Sn{N(SiMe3)2}2 gives OsH4{Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2}(PiPr3)2 with a pentagonal bipyramidal geometry.







Abstract
Hexahydride OsH6(PiPr3)2 (1) releases H2 to form the isomeric tetrahydrides 2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b of general formula OsH4(PiPr3)2. Tetrylenes E{N(SiMe3)2}2 (E=Ge, Sn) are able to selectively trap these isomers distinguishing between them. Tetrylene Ge{N(SiMe3)2}2 catches 2&#8201;b to generate OsH4{Ge[N(SiMe3)2]2}(PiPr3)2 (3), which has a piano stool geometry, while Sn{N(SiMe3)2}2 captures 2&#8201;a to give OsH4{Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2}(PiPr3)2 (4) with the donor atoms defining a pentagonal bipyramid around the osmium center.

         <title>Broken Symmetry and Elastic Frustration in Isostructural MnIII Spin Crossover Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Opening of both symmetry breaking and non&#8208;symmetry breaking thermal evolution pathways is demonstrated for isostructural crystals of a MnIII spin crossover cationic complex embedded in lattices with heavy anions ReO4&#8722;, AsF6&#8722; and SbF6&#8722;. This highlights the power of crystal engineering in coupling structural and electronic instabilities in molecular systems and the potential for tuning transition profiles.







Abstract
Symmetry breaking spin state transitions in two of three isostructural salts of MnIII spin crossover cations, [MnIII(3&#8208;OMe&#8208;5&#8208;NO2&#8208;sal2323)]+, with heavy anions are reported. The ReO4&#8722; (1) salt undergoes two&#8208;step spin crossover which is coupled with a re&#8208;entrant symmetry breaking structural phase transition between a high temperature phase (S=2, C2/c), an intermediate ordered phase (S=1/S=2, P21/c), and a low temperature phase (S=1, C2/c). The AsF6&#8722; (2) complex undergoes an abrupt transition between a high temperature phase (S=2, C2/c) and a low temperature ordered phase (S=1/S=2, P

). The SbF6&#8722; (3) complex undergoes a gradual transition between a high temperature phase (S=2, P

1&#8254;

 ${\bar{1}}$



) and a low temperature spin state ordered phase (S=1/S=2, P&#8208;

). Correlation of the volume of the anion and the T1/2 of the transitions in these complexes and three analogous complexes with similar anions, BF4&#8722; (4), ClO4&#8722; (5), PF6&#8722; (6), reveals an increase in T1/2 upon increasing the anion volume. We rationalise that the volume of the anions used modulates the elastic interactions between the MnIII sites in the lattice, with increasing elastic frustration with the larger anions resulting in a two&#8208;stepped transition for 1 and the stabilisation of the mixed (HS:LS) state to low temperature for 2 and 3.

         <title>Structures and Properties of Axially Chiral (2E,4E,6Z,8Z)&#8208;Nona&#8208;2,4,6,8&#8208;Tetraenoate Derivatives Highly Substituted by Aryl Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We found that unique (2E,4E,6Z,8Z)&#8208;nona&#8208;2,4,6,8&#8208;tetraenoate derivatives highly substituted by aryl groups had axial chirality. Although racemization of an enantiomer of a representative compound was observed even at a low temperature, a cyclic dimer synthesized by head&#8208;to&#8208;tail transesterification of a modified analog showed stable axial chirality. Those compounds showed aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), and the chiral cyclic dimer exhibits solid&#8208;state circularly polarized luminescence (CPL).







Abstract
Unprecedented (2E,4E,6Z,8Z)&#8208;nona&#8208;2,4,6,8&#8208;tetraenoate derivatives highly substituted by aryl groups have been synthesized by the reaction of rhodium complexes having aryl&#8208;substituted hexa&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;trienyl ligands with acrylates. These compounds have potential axial chirality, and their enantiomers are isolable by the chiral HPLC technique. Although the racemization barrier of isolated enantiomers was not high, it was found that a cyclic dimer synthesized by head&#8208;to&#8208;tail transesterification of a modified analog has quite a stable axial chirality even at a high temperature. From a structural analogy with tetraphenylethene, those compounds are emissive in the solid state, and the chiral cyclic dimer exhibits solid&#8208;state circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity.

Although racemization of an enantiomer of a representative compound was observed even at a low temperature, a cyclic dimer synthesized by head-to-tail transesterification of a modified analog showed stable axial chirality. Those compounds showed aggregation-induced emission (AIE), and the chiral cyclic dimer exhibits solid-state circularly polarized luminescence (CPL).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unprecedented (2&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;,4&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;,6&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;,8&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;)-nona-2,4,6,8-tetraenoate derivatives highly substituted by aryl groups have been synthesized by the reaction of rhodium complexes having aryl-substituted hexa-1,3,5-trienyl ligands with acrylates. These compounds have potential axial chirality, and their enantiomers are isolable by the chiral HPLC technique. Although the racemization barrier of isolated enantiomers was not high, it was found that a cyclic dimer synthesized by head-to-tail transesterification of a modified analog has quite a stable axial chirality even at a high temperature. From a structural analogy with tetraphenylethene, those compounds are emissive in the solid state, and the chiral cyclic dimer exhibits solid-state circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>What Factors Determine the Brevione B Desaturation Mechanism in the Nonheme Iron Dioxygenase BrvJ?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Density functional theory calculations on the nonheme iron desaturase BrvJ show that desaturation happens through two consecutive hydrogen atom abstraction barriers, while the OH rebound barrier is stereochemically hindered. We also tested a second reaction cycle and show that product is not released but can undergo a second cycle with small barriers to from brevione C products.







Abstract
The natural product synthesis of brevione J undergoes a cascade of reactions including an oxidative desaturation and a ring&#8208;expansion. The C1&#8722;C2 desaturation of brevione B is catalyzed by the nonheme iron dioxygenase BrvJ using one molecule of O2 and &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate (&#945;KG). However, whether the subsequent oxidative ring expansion reaction is also catalyzed by the same enzyme is unknown and remains controversial. To gain insight into the mechanism of brevione J biosynthesis a computational study is reported here using molecular dynamics and density functional theory approaches. The work predicts that both cycles can proceed in the same protein structure on an iron center with O2 and &#945;KG for each cycle. The rate&#8208;determining step is a hydrogen atom abstraction step in both reaction cycles. Interestingly, the OH rebound barriers are high in energy in cycle 1 due to stereochemical interactions and substrate positioning that enable an efficient desaturation reaction.

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Nucleophilic Propargylation of Azinium Ions via Hydroxydihydroazine Intermediates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic propargylations of azinium ions with a propargylboronate give functionalized 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines, 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines, 1,4&#8208;dihydroquinolines, 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines, and 4,5&#8208;dihydropyrazines in good yields and high regioselectivities. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that hydroxydihydroazine intermediates formed by the addition of LiOH to the azinium ions are the reactive electrophiles.







Abstract
The nucleophilic propargylation of azinium ions with a propargylboronate proceeds efficiently under gold(I) catalysis. A range of N&#8208;alkylated pyridinium, quinolinium, and pyrazinium ions undergo propargylation with good yields and high regioselectivities to give various functionalized 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines, 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines, 1,4&#8208;dihydroquinolines, 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines, and 4,5&#8208;dihydropyrazines. No allenylation side&#8208;products are observed. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided insight into the mechanisms of these reactions. Hydroxydihydroazine intermediates formed by the addition of LiOH to the azinium ions were found to be the reactive electrophiles in these reactions.

         <title>Transitioning to Green Discovery&#8208;Based Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The path to truly sustainable chemistry is a complex one, but an immediate area with near&#8208; and long&#8208;term benefit is improved sustainability in fundamental study of catalysis. Examples from catalytic hydrophosphination not only show success under more green conditions but how green choices are truly advancing.







Abstract
Pressure is mounting to minimize the carbon footprint of chemical industry while increasing its sustainability. An argument is made that working from Green Chemistry principles during discovery&#8208;based catalysis results in effective chemistry and circumvents a need to &#8220;rediscover&#8221; chemical reactivity under sustainable conditions. Examples of comparative success in selected examples of hydrophosphination catalysis in various degrees of development are provided to support two main ideas: 1)&#8197;Starting from more sustainable practices in chemical discovery is inertia in methodology that should be overcome, and 2)&#8197;substantial challenges remain in catalysis for which sustainable solutions would positively impact other areas of chemistry. Examples of successes, even in the face of the challenges noted, are presented herein as indications that even as a starting point, sustainability can meet short&#8208; and long&#8208;term needs. These ideas indicate critical but simple strategies for fundamental research to be impactful in the sustainability of the chemical industry broadly.

         <title>Binding&#8208;Site Directed Selection and Large&#8208;Scale Click&#8208;Synthesis of a Coagulation Factor XIa&#8208;Inhibiting Circular DNA Aptamer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coagulation factor XIa&#8208;inhibiting circular aptamer is discovered from an asymmetrical dumbbell structured DNA library through a binding&#8208;site directed selection strategy. The pre&#8208;designed structure facilitates quantitative cyclization using click chemistry. With significantly enhanced functionality and satisfactory scalability in synthesis, this circular aptamer presents a promising option as a next&#8208;generation DNA&#8208;based anticoagulant.







Abstract
Factor XIa (FXIa) is a plasma protease that catalyzes the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation, thus being regarded as a promising antithrombotic target. Circular DNA aptamers, with their dramatically enhanced biological and structural stability, hold great potential as new&#8208;generation DNA&#8208;based anticoagulants. However, the functional selection of circular aptamers and large&#8208;scale synthesis of them remains a substantial challenge. In this study, we explored a binding&#8208;site directed selection strategy to enrich circular DNA aptamers that can target the catalytic domain of FXIa and inhibit its function. An asymmetrical dumbbell structured DNA library with self&#8208;shielding primer&#8208;binding site was utilized for selection. This approach has resulted in the identification of a circular DNA aptamer, named FICAPT1, which demonstrates a high binding affinity (Kd=20&#8197;nM), notable stability (with a half&#8208;life of 16&#8197;h in human plasma) and outstanding anticoagulation activity (with significantly prolonged aPTT), showing great promise as a novel anticoagulant. Moreover, a refined version of FICAPT1, named as CC&#8208;FICAPT1, was quantitatively synthesized (~2&#8197;mg/mL) by taking advantage of the pre&#8208;designed structure and high cyclization efficiency of click chemistry. The approach presented in this study enables the efficient generation of functional circular DNA aptamers and allows for their synthesis in a satisfactory scale, making it adaptable for the production of various circular aptamers for therapeutic applications.

         <title>A Unique Case of &#8242;in Situ&#8217; Bifluoride Triggered Formation of Supramolecular Organogels Using Isophthalamide Hydrogen Bond Donating Receptors.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isopthalamide based receptor H2L2 featuring two p&#8208;benzoic acid units deprotonates in the presence of TBAF and the deprotonated L22&#8722; binds the in&#8197;situ formed HF2&#8722;. Combination of the H&#8208;bond donor abilities of the isophthalamide motif and the presence of the carboxylic acid moieties promotes a complex and unexpected isodesmic self&#8208;assembly process uniquely with HF2&#8722; leading to the formation of a stable thixotropic supramolecular gel.







Abstract
A novel isopthalamide based receptor H2L2 featuring two p&#8208;benzoic acid units has been synthesised and its anion binding properties analysed by 1H&#8208;NMR spectroscopy in DMSO&#8208;d6/0.5&#8201;% H2O. As expected, in the presence of tetrabutylammonium (TBA) fluoride the deprotonation of the carboxylic acid moieties was observed. However, the deprotonated receptor L22&#8722; was able to bind the in&#8197;situ formed HF2&#8722; via the formation of H&#8208;bonds with the amide NHs. When H2L2 was dissolved in THF and 4 equivalents of TBAF were added in CH3CN a unique sol&#8208;gel transition occurred giving rise to a stable thixotropic supramolecular gel. Theoretical calculations elucidated the gelation mechanism and strongly support the findings observed experimentally.

&lt;p&gt;The isopthalamide based receptor H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;L2 featuring two &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-benzoic acid units deprotonates in the presence of TBAF and the deprotonated L2&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; binds the &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; formed HF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. Combination of the H-bond donor abilities of the isophthalamide motif and the presence of the carboxylic acid moieties promotes a complex and unexpected isodesmic self-assembly process uniquely with HF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; leading to the formation of a stable thixotropic supramolecular gel.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel isopthalamide based receptor H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;L2&lt;/b&gt; featuring two &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-benzoic acid units has been synthesised and its anion binding properties analysed by &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-NMR spectroscopy in DMSO-&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/0.5&#8201;% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. As expected, in the presence of tetrabutylammonium (TBA) fluoride the deprotonation of the carboxylic acid moieties was observed. However, the deprotonated receptor &lt;b&gt;L2&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; was able to bind the &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; formed HF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; the formation of H-bonds with the amide NHs. When H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;L2&lt;/b&gt; was dissolved in THF and 4 equivalents of TBAF were added in CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN a unique sol-gel transition occurred giving rise to a stable thixotropic supramolecular gel. Theoretical calculations elucidated the gelation mechanism and strongly support the findings observed experimentally.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Methylaluminoxane Reactivities and Anionic Structures: From Small Oligomers to Large Sheets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structure and reactivity of small methylaluminoxane (MAO) species (MeAlO)n(Me3Al)m (n = 1&#8208;8) have been investigated using DFT (M06&#8208;2X), MP2, and CCSD(T) calculations. This hierarchy of methods reveals that DFT artificially stabilizes structures containing 4&#8208;coordinate oxygen atoms while higher&#8208;level calculations demonstrate a clear preference for structures with 3&#8208;coordinate oxygen and 4&#8208;coordinate aluminum centers. Analysis of ionization pathways shows these neutral MAO molecules form anions through either methide or Me2Al+ abstraction, with the latter mechanism dominant for sheet structures (n = 5&#8208;8). Smaller species (n = 1&#8208;4, m &#8805; n) show minimal reactivity toward either ionization pathway. The resulting anions consistently adopt sheet structures with 3&#8208;coordinate oxygen and 4&#8208;coordinate aluminum at all levels of theory. We introduce a comprehensive stability metric incorporating both ionization energies and neutral precursor stability, which successfully explains the distribution of anions observed in ESI&#8208;MS spectra during Me3Al hydrolysis. Extension of this analysis to larger species, including the recently isolated and characterized sheet (MeAlO)26(Me3Al)9 (Luo et al., Science, 2024, 384, 1424&#8208;1428), reveals unexpected trends in reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Core&#8208;Functionalised Naphthalenediimides from Naphthalenetetracarboxylic Dianhydride using a Vibratory Ball Mill: Bromination, Imidization and Heck&#8208;Type Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Core&#8208;functionalised naphthalene diimides (c&#8208;NDIs) are an important component in organic electronics. Current methods for their production frequently require long reaction times, large quantities of solvent and inert conditions. Herein, we report the synthesis of a series c&#8208;NDIs by a 3&#8208;step synthesis from naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (NDI) using only environmentally sustainable mechanochemical methods and without excluding air or moisture.







Abstract
The synthesis of 9 core&#8208;functionalised naphthalene diimide (c&#8208;NDI) residues is reported via a 3&#8208;step synthesis from naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride using only mechanochemical activation. Selective dibromination and subsequent diimidization were achieved for the first time in a vibratory ball mill, resulting in the key structural intermediate, 2,6&#8208;dibromonaphthalenediimide (DBND), which is the basis for elaboration into a multitude of organic electronic materials. Our new synthesis of DBND is achieved in just 5&#8197;hours reaction time over two steps compared to typical solution state times of 24&#8197;hours. Subsequent Heck&#8208;type cross coupling reactions, with a range of styrene residues, produced a series of c&#8208;NDIs in good yields. The Heck&#8208;type reactions are rapid (1.5&#8197;hours), require no additional heating or solvent and are tolerant of atmospheric moisture and air.

         <title>Creating Dual Active Sites in Ru&#8208;doped FeMn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 for Efficient Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of well&#8208;engineered bifunctional electrocatalysts is crucial for achieving durable and efficient performance in overall water splitting. In this study, Ru&#8208;doped FeMn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 itself has Ru sites and generates FeMnOOH under catalytic conditions, forming dual active sites for overall water splitting. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the Ru dopants exhibit optimized binding strength for H* and enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance. Moreover, the Mn sites within FeMnOOH lower the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step (from O* to OOH*), serving as the active centre for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The incorporation of Ru significantly improves the electron transfer properties of FeMn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 and enhances its water adsorption capacity, synergistically boosting its bifunctional activity. This strategy of designing dual active sites provides new insights into the development of bifunctional metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) for efficient overall water splitting.</dc:description>

         <title>Meso&#8208;&#946; Monofused Porphyrins: Synthesis, Structural, Spectral, Electrochemical and DFT Studies and Their Efficient Third&#8208;Order Nonlinear Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Promising Fusion! &#946;&#8208;to&#8208;ortho monofused porphyrins and their derivatives have been successfully synthesized and characterized. These porphyrins exhibit electronic spectral features in the low&#8208;energy region and demonstrate tuneable electrochemical redox properties, resulting from their tailored design and peripheral fusion. Ultrafast third&#8208;order nonlinear optical studies reveal promising two&#8208;photon absorption coefficients and effective cross&#8208;section values, highlighting their potential for future optoelectronic applications.







Abstract
Three new series of &#946;&#8208;to&#8208;ortho&#8208;phenyl monofused porphyrins, denoted as MMFP(MN)X2 (where MFP=monofused porphyrin, MN=malononitrile and X=H or Br) and MMFP(MN)MB (where MB=mono benzo, M=2H, Co(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II)) were designed and successfully synthesized with good yields. These compounds were thoroughly characterized using various spectroscopic techniques and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis. Notably, three of the monofused porphyrins; CoMFP(MN)Br2, CuMFP(MN)Br2 and ZnMFP(MN)MB crystallized unambiguously in a triclinic crystal system with a

 space group. The twist angle values for these structures ranged from 14.03&#176; to 21.35&#176;. The meso&#8208;&#946; peripheral fusion and substituents led to tunable electronic spectral features across the synthesized porphyrins. The first reduction and oxidation potentials of all the investigated monofused porphyrins exhibited significant anodically shift as compared to their parent tetraphenylporphyrins (TPPs), attributed to peripheral fusion and electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents, which collectively led to a reduced HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap. Ultrafast third&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) studies revealed that these monofused porphyrins showed a strong two&#8208;photon absorption coefficient (&#946;=0.18&#8211;39.06&#215;10&#8722;11&#8197;m/W) and effective cross&#8208;section (

         <title>Unravelling the Relaxation Pathway and Excited State Dynamics of Ruthenium(II) Polypyridyl Complexes Incorporating Phosphorus&#8208;Based Monodentate Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relaxation pathway and excited state dynamics of [Ru(N3)(N2)(PTA)]2+ type Ru(II)&#8208;polypyridyls containing phosphorus&#8208;based monodentate ligand PTA (1,3,5&#8208;triaza&#8208;7&#8208;phosphaadamantane) from the photogenerated excited state suggested the involvement of 3MC excited state. The effect of N&#8208;methylation of the PTA on the photophysical properties and excited state relaxation dynamics of the complexes was rationalized.







Abstract
Herein, the photophysical, photochemical properties and photogenerated excited state dynamics of two new Ru(II) complexes, viz. [Ru(p&#8208;ttp)(bpy)(PTA)]2+ [1]2+, [Ru(p&#8208;ttp)(phen)(PTA)]2+ [2]2+ having a phosphorus&#8208;based ligand PTA [p&#8208;ttp=p&#8208;tolyl terpyridine; bpy=2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridyl; phen=1,10&#8208;phenanthroline and PTA=1,3,5&#8208;triaza&#8208;7&#8208;phosphaadamantane] are reported. Upon excitation with 470&#8197;nm LED, [1]2+ and [2]2+ neither undergo ligand release nor exhibit room temperature luminescence/1O2 generation. However, when excited around their respective MLCT bands at 77&#8197;K, luminescence bands at ~600&#8197;nm were observed. N&#8208;methylation of the coordinated PTA in complex [1]2+ resulted in [Ru(p&#8208;ttp)(bpy)(MePTA]3+ {[1&#8208;Me]3+} (MePTA=N&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triaza&#8208;7&#8208;phosphaadamantane). The differences in the photophysical and electrochemical properties of [1]2+ and [1&#8208;Me]3+ were rationalized by DFT calculations. The transient absorption spectroscopic analysis was used to unravel the relaxation pathway of the complexes, suggesting the involvement of the 3MC state in the relaxation process. The effect of electronic modulation resulted from the N&#8208;methylation of PTA on the excited state dynamics of the complexes was observed. The MTT assays in various cancer cells revealed their non&#8208;cytotoxic nature in the dark or upon irradiation with 470&#8197;nm blue LED. The non&#8208;toxicity of the complexes, despite being internalized in cancer cells as established by ICP&#8208;MS, is attributed to their dark and photostability and the inability to generate 1O2.

         <title>Intermolecular 1,2&#8208;Difunctionalization of Nitriles via Redox Gold Catalysis: Synthesis of Benzoxazoles and Benzimidazoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unprecedent gold&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of nitriles with o&#8208;iodophenols or o&#8208;iodoanilines via Au(I)/Au(III) redox catalysis has been developed, leading to benzoxazoles or benzimidazoles with broad substrate scope. Mechanistic investigation reveals that the Au(III)&#8208;Ar species generated via oxidative addition of o&#8208;iodophenol to MeDalphosAu+, serves as a key intermediate. The method was also applied to the synthesis of poly aza&#8208;heterocycles.







Abstract
The unprecedent gold&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of nitriles with o&#8208;iodophenols or o&#8208;iodoanilines via Au(I)/Au(III) redox catalysis has been developed, providing an expedient route to the synthesis of benzoxazoles or benzimidazoles with broad substrate scope and high functional compatibility. Mechanistic investigation reveals that the Au(III)&#8208;Ar species generated via oxidative addition of o&#8208;iodophenol to MeDalphosAu+, serves as a key intermediate. Particularly, this annulation is initiated by oxidative addition, rather than the nucleophilic attack of the phenol moiety in o&#8208;iodophenol towards the nitrile. The method was also applied to the synthesis of poly aza&#8208;heterocycles via a cascade Au(I)/Au(III) and Au(I) catalysis relay.

         <title>Amino&#8208;substituted Azoxybenzenes as Potential Redox&#8208;Active Catholyte Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryl diazenes, particularly azobenzenes (AB), represent a versatile class of compounds with significant historical and practical relevance, ranging from dyes to molecular machines, solar thermal and electrochemical storage. Their oxygen&#8208;substituted counterparts, azoxybenzenes (AOB), share structural similarities but have been less explored, especially in energy storage applications. This study investigates the redox properties of AOB, comparing them to AB, and evaluates their potential as redox&#8208;active materials for energy storage systems. Through cyclic voltammetry (CV) and spectro&#8208;electrochemical analyses, we demonstrate that AOBs exhibit a distinct redox behaviour, influenced by the solvent and electrolyte environment, with a reversible oxidation process. Despite their promising redox characteristics, AOBs suffer from capacity decay during galvanostatic cycling, likely due to the instability of the radical cation intermediate. These findings suggest that while AOBs offer intriguing redox properties, further investigation into stabilization strategies are needed for their application in energy storage.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of polyferrocenyldimethylsilane&#8208;b&#8208;poly(L&#8208;glutamic acid) block copolymers was systematically explored. Rod&#8208;like and plate&#8208;like micelles were prepared from self&#8208;assembly of the block copolymers in aqueous solution with two different approaches. In a dissolution&#8208;dialysis approach, micelles were prepared by dissolving a block copolymer sample in excess aqueous base followed by the dialysis of the solution against water. The morphology of the resultant micelles showed composition dependence. The block copolymer sample with the lowest soluble block content formed rod&#8208;like micelles, while the other samples with higher soluble block content formed spherical micelles. In a THF&#8208;mediated approach, THF was added into a block copolymer solution, which was first prepared by the dissolution&#8208;dialysis approach, and then the THF was evaporated slowly. Plate&#8208;like micelles were obtained from all the block copolymer samples examined, and these had a broad range of soluble block content. The formation of these plate&#8208;like micelles was attributed to the crystallization of the PFDMS blocks in the presence of THF. A tendency of large platelet micelles evolving to thin filaments over time was observed. This change may have been driven by the increase in the corona&#8208;chain stretching energy as THF evaporated.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbamate&#8208;Functionalized NLOphores via a Formal [2+2] Cycloaddition&#8208;Retroelectrocyclization Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study introduces a new donor group capable of activating click&#8208;type [2+2] cycloaddition&#8208;retroelectrocyclizations, generally known for their limited scope. Target chromophores were synthesized using isocyanate&#8208;free urethane synthesis. The developed synthetic method allows for the tuning of the optical properties of the chromophores by modifying the donor groups, the acceptor units, and the side chains. The charge transfer (CT) bands of the chromophores exhibit &#955;max values ranging from 363 to 692 nm. The CT bands observed have been supported by solvatochromism and protonation experiments. The synthesized compounds exhibit positive solvatochromism. Due to their potential as NLOphore candidates, the stability of the synthesized compounds have been investigated both experimentally through TGA and theoretically by calculating parameters such as frontier orbital energy differences, electronegativity, and global hardness/softness. TD&#8208;DFT calculations were used to elucidate the nature of the electronic transitions, revealing that the bands correspond to CT arising from HOMO&#8208;to&#8208;LUMO excitations. The NLO properties of the chromophores were investigated theoretically by DFT methods and experimentally by the EFISHG technique. Both results are shown to be in agreement with HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy differences. The experimental &#956;&#946; values of the selected molecules range from 470 &#215; 10&#8211;48 to 5400 &#215; 10&#8211;48 esu.</dc:description>

         <title>Selenium Nucleophilicity and Electrophilicity in the Intra&#8208; and Intermolecular SN2 Reactions of Selenenyl Sulfide Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chalcogenide exchange reactions are an important class of bimolecular nucleophilic substitution reactions (SN2) involving sulfur and selenium species as nucleophile, central atom, and/or leaving group, which are fundamental throughout redox biology and metabolism. While thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange reactions have been deeply investigated, those involving selenium are less understood, especially with regards to the polarised selenenyl sulfides RSe&#8211;SR' even though the directed reactivity of selenenyl sulfides is biologically crucial for selenoenzymes such as thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). Synthetic methods to create asymmetric selenenyl sulfides with high regiochemical purity only emerged over the last five years; this functional group has already demonstrated powerful applications to cell biology, through probes for molecular imaging (e.g. the TrxR probe "RX1") or reagents for thiol&#8208;mediated uptake (e.g. remote ammonium thiaselenanes). Here, we investigate the SN2@S and SN2@Se reactions of selenenyl sulfides in silico to provide the first comprehensive overview of their kinetic and thermodynamic trends, referencing against symmetrical disulfides and diselenides. We quantify the role of alternative exchange reactions in the double&#8208;exchange chemistry of RX1. This analysis rationalises the origins of RX1's TrxR&#8208;specificity even within thiol&#8208;rich cellular environments and can support the design and applications of a range of selenenyl sulfide&#8208;based bioactive probes.</dc:description>

         <title>DECIPHERING AND COUNTERING FORMIC ACID PERMEABILITY IN ZERO&#8208;GAP ELECTROLYZERS</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, formic acid (FA) has garnered attention as a compelling molecule for various chemical and everyday applications Additionally, with recent studies demonstrating direct FA generation through CO2&#160;electrolysis, it can serve as a stable liquid hydrogen carrier. Nevertheless, FA&#8208;permeability via semi&#8208;permeable ion&#8209;exchange membranes (FA&#8208;crossover) still constitutes a major issue in scalable polymer&#8208;electrolyte separated zero&#8208;gap electrolyzers, limiting the breakthrough of the technology to the larger&#8208;scale. Herein we present a holistic route towards understanding the mechanism of FA&#8208;crossover in zero&#8208;gap cells. The gained know&#8208;how through formic acid uptake, gel&#8208;phase conductivity, and membrane permeability measurements allowed for the development of an easy&#8208;to&#8208;scale barrier layer, showing a FA&#8208;flux (JFA) decrease by 46&#160;% at 200&#160;mA cm&#8209;2&#160;compared to bare Nafion&#8208;membranes.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the Metal&#8208;Centered Reactivity of Isomeric, N&#8208;Bridged Biscyclometalated Platinum(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidation of new N&#8208;bridged bis(phenylpyridine)platinum(II) complexes is explored, uncovering the chemical and photophysical properties of Pt(IV) monomers and Pt(III) dimers. The mystery of the Pt(III) dimers is unraveled, implicating the bulky phenylenes on the bridging nitrogen and the isomeric binding pockets as co&#8208;factors in destabilizing the rare intermetallic Pt&#8211;Pt bond.







Abstract
The field of platinum chemistry is ubiquitous in the research of anticancer drugs and new OLED materials. Within the vast library of existing compounds, the majority of work focuses on complexes in the +2 and +4 oxidation states, with comparatively few examples of PtIII complexes reported without bridging ligands. PtIII complexes with metal&#8208;metal bonding can be made by mild oxidation of PtII complexes having bis(phenylpyridine) ligands. Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of two new PtII complexes bearing tetradentate N&#8208;bridged bis(phenylpyridine) ligands with N^C*C^N and C^N*N^C coordinating atoms. Through chemical oxidation with PhICl2 and N&#8208;chlorosuccinimide, we obtained four new complexes containing PtIV and PtIII centres. The dynamics of the PtIII&#160;complexes were explored by variable&#8208;temperature NMR studies and showed surprisingly free rotation of the appended N&#8208;aryl group. This work uncovers the importance of the destabilizing nature of the bulky N&#8208;aryl group on intermetallic bonds, and sheds light on how the molecular rotation observed in the PtIII compounds could inspire new molecular rotors driven by intermetallic bonds.

         <title>Peptide&#8211;Bismuth Tricycles: Maximizing Stability by Constraint</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A challenge in drug discovery is creating peptides that are sufficiently stable. By progressively increasing structural constraint through macrocyclization chemistry in combination with bismuth binding &#8211; from linear to cyclic, bicyclic, and finally tricyclic peptides &#8211; we greatly enhance peptide stability without compromising activity. This yields bismuth&#8211;peptide tricycles that remain stable at cellular glutathione concentrations and in plasma.







Abstract
Constrained peptides possess excellent properties for identifying lead compounds in drug discovery. While it has become increasingly straightforward to discover selective high&#8208;affinity peptide ligands, especially through genetically encoded libraries, their stability and bioavailability remain significant challenges. By integrating macrocyclization chemistry with bismuth binding, we generated series of linear, cyclic, bicyclic, and tricyclic peptides with identical sequences. Utilizing bismuth to rigidify the peptide structure allows for a better comparison of different constraint levels, reducing confounding effects of interactions often seen with hydrophobic stapling reagents. Our study facilitated the identification of a peptide&#8211;bismuth tricycle that fully withstands cellular levels of glutathione, acts as a nanomolar protease inhibitor without being proteolytically digested by its target, and is fully stable in human plasma. Importantly, this multicyclic peptide does not possess any non&#8208;canonical amino acid modifications. Using oxime ligation, we conjugated an analogue of this tricycle to the N&#8208;terminus of two nanobodies to demonstrate potential applications in targeted therapy.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Dependent C(sp3)&#8722;CF3 Reductive Elimination from Neutral Four&#8208;Coordinate Cu(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two distinct pathways for C(sp3)&#8722;CF3 bond&#8208;forming reductive elimination from a well&#8208;defined neutral 4&#8208;coordinate Cu(III) complex were identified. In medium polar solvent DCE, the reaction occurs mainly via a concerted bond&#8208;break/bond formation pathway, while in polar solvent DMF, the reaction proceeds via a rate&#8208;determining ligand dissociation pathway.







Abstract
A solvent dependent C(sp3)&#8722;CF3 bond&#8208;forming reductive elimination from neutral four&#8208;coordinate Cu(III) complexes [(L)CuIII(CF3)2(CH2CO2tBu)] (L=pyridine or its derivatives) is described. Reactions in less polar solvent ClCH2CH2Cl proceed via a concerted bond breaking/bond forming process along with the reorientation of the ligand, while reaction in polar solvent DMF occurs via a rate limiting ligand&#8208;dissociation, followed by C(sp3)&#8722;CF3 reductive elimination from the resulting three&#8208;coordinate intermediate. These mechanistic proposals are supported by kinetic studies that included ligand and temperature effects, as well as DFT calculations.

         <title>Stepwise Modulation of Bridged Single&#8208;Benzene&#8208;Based Fluorophores for Materials Science</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library consisting of five single&#8208;benzene&#8208;based fluorophores was designed. Changing the bridging atoms between oxygen and nitrogen significantly impacts the photophysical properties in solution, the solid&#8208;state, and 3D&#8208;printed materials. This results in high quantum yield values and environmentally insensitive behavior. Using the full&#8208;color range of these compounds, white light emission was attained utilizing stereolithography.







Abstract
In recent years, researchers studying fluorogenic samples have steadily shifted from using large, expensive, poorly soluble fluorophores with complex synthetic sequences to smaller, simpler &#960; scaffolds with low molecular weight. This research article presents an in&#8208;depth study of the photophysical properties of five bridged single&#8208;benzene&#8208;based fluorophores (SBBFs) investigated for their solution and solid&#8208;state emission (SSSE) properties. The compounds O4, N1O3, N2O2, N3O1, and N4 are derived from a central terephthalonitrile core and vary in the amount of oxygen and nitrogen bridging atoms. These minimalized emitters show full&#8208;color tunable emission properties and exhibit moderate&#8208;to&#8208;high photoluminescence quantum yield values reaching up to 0.78 in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). In addition to demonstrating excellent compatibility in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) films and additive manufacturing using stereolithography (SLA), white light emission was achieved in both solution and 3D&#8208;printed materials by controlling the mixing ratio of the compounds. Employing density&#8208;functional theory (DFT), well&#8208;correlating theoretical absorption and emission wavelengths were calculated as average values of the different possible conformers. Furthermore, cellular internalization of the substances was accomplished using Pluronic&#174; F&#8208;127 nanoparticles. Overall, this study emphasizes the remarkable properties of single&#8208;benzene&#8208;based emitters, showcasing their accessibility and potential applications in biomedical fields and materials science.

         <title>Programming Green Light&#8208;Responsive Hydrogels: From Photo&#8208;Weakening to Photo&#8208;Unresponsiveness and Photo&#8208;Strengthening</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The light response of CarHc protein&#8208;based hydrogels can be alterted from photo&#8208;weakening, to photo&#8208;strengthening, or becoming light&#8208;unresponsive depending on the added cofactors AdoCbl and Co2+. Under green light, CarHc tetramers disassembly weakens the hydrogel, while excess AdoCbl crosslinking poly&#8208;histidine tags strengthens it. This AdoCbl&#8208;induced photo&#8208;responsiveness expands the potential applications of these hydrogels as adaptable responsive systems.







Abstract
Light&#8208;responsive hydrogels are highly valued for their dynamic mechanical properties and biocompatibility. In this study, we present a hydrogel system that can either soften or strengthen on green light exposure, or remain unresponsive to light, depending on the addition of adenosyl cobalamin (AdoCbl) and Co2+. These protein&#8208;based hydrogels were formed using genetically encoded SpyTag&#8208;SpyCatcher chemistry and included green light&#8208;sensitive CarHc protein domains. As previously reported, these hydrogels formed in the dark with the addition of AdoCbl, due to the tetramerization of the CarHc domains. Upon green light exposure, the CarHc tetramers disassembled, leading to a rapid transition from gel to sol. Interestingly, we discovered that an excess of AdoCbl leads to photo&#8208;strengthening rather than photo&#8208;weakening. This occurred because light exposure induces interchain crosslinks between AdoCbl and poly&#8208;histidine tags (His6&#8208;tags) of the proteins. Furthermore, incorporating Co2+ ions enhanced hydrogel stiffness by coordinating to His6&#8208;tags. This not only suppressed photo&#8208;weakening but also promoted photo&#8208;strengthening behaviour. These findings highlight the role of His6&#8208;tags in photochemical crosslinking with excess AdoCbl and in coordination to Co2+ ions, providing a novel strategy for designing tuneable, light responsiveness in materials.

We have developed an efficient synthesis of fluoroalkenes via tandem electrochemical dehalogenation&#8208;elimination protocol. The key step is the generation of carbon anion by electrochemical reductive dehalogenation of alkyl halides. Various gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes and monofluoroalkenes were prepared in moderate to good yields from &#945;&#8208;difluoromethylated/&#945;&#8208;trifluoro methylated benzyl halides.

         <title>Electrochemical Deconstruction of Waste Polyvinylidene Chloride (PVDC) to Value&#8208;Added Products in Batch and Flow</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical deconstruction of polyvinylidene chloride produces value&#8208;added chemicals and provides a solution to recycle halogenated polymers. The inevitable challenges, e.&#8201;g., high chlorine content and facile release of HCl, are found advantageous in the present strategy, which was further translated to flow at a 6.0&#8197;mmol scale. Chlorinated compounds were produced with high efficiency, together with a very high degree of dechlorination (98&#8201;%).







Abstract
Chlorinated polymers have made enormous contributions to materials science and are commercially produced on a large scale. These chlorinated polymers could be recycled as chlorine sources to efficiently produce valuable chlorinated compounds owing to their facile release of HCl. Although the thermal stability of PVDC is low compared to PVC, this can be advantageous in terms of easy and fast dehydrochlorination. Herein, we report an efficient electrochemical chlorination using poly(vinylidene chloride) (PVDC) as a chlorine source that works in an undivided cell and applies to a good number of examples. This method works on commodity polymers such as waste PVDC&#8208;PVC pharma blister film, PVDC&#8208;PO multilayer food packaging, and compression molded sheets of Ixan PVDC (with heat stabilizer) with similar efficiency. Furthermore, this method also provides the dechlorination of PVDC up to 98&#8201;%, leading to unsaturated dechlorinated material. Converting PVDC into more stable unsaturated compounds, the release of harmful chlorine&#8208;containing gases during incineration can be minimized. Additionally, this method is not only restricted to batch processes but an electroflow process for PVDC dechlorination and electrosynthesis has also been demonstrated.

         <title>Catalytic Serine Labeling in Nonaqueous, Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemoselective modification of alkylalcohols (e.g., serine residues) on proteins has been a daunting challenge especially in aqueous media. Herein, we report chemical modifications of alkylalcohols in protein and cell lysate samples using carboxylic acid&#8208;based bioconjugation media. The acidic medium is not only useful to suppress reactivity of other nucleophiles in proteins, but the medium also serves as a potentially biomolecule&#8208;compatible solvent. The acid&#8208;catalyzed acylation strategy has a unique selectivity paradigm compared to the common active&#8208;serine&#8208;targeted method and would act as a new strategy for studying biological roles of serine residues.</dc:description>

         <title>A Unique Intramolecular Redox Reaction by Unidirectional Migration of Three Hydrogen Atoms: Theoretical Elucidation of the 3H&#8208;Transfer Sequence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intramolecular migration of three hydrogen atoms from one moiety of a gaseous radical cation to the other prior to fragmentation is an extremely rare type of redox reaction. Within the scope of this investigation, this scenario requires an ionized but electron&#8208;rich arene acceptor bearing a para&#8208;(3&#8208;hydroxyalkyl) residue. The precise mechanism of such unidirectional 3H transfer processes, including the order of the individual H transfer steps, has remained unclear in spite of previous isotope labelling and recent infrared ion spectroscopy (IRIS) studies. Herein, the details of this peculiar process have been investigated for ionized 4&#8208;(N,N&#8208;dimethylaminophenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;butanol, 2, by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The energetically most favorable pathway consists of a sequence of successive 1,4&#8208;, 1,6&#8208; and 1,5&#8208;H steps. During these steps the secondary alcohol functionality is oxidized to a carbonyl group and the radical&#8208;cationic aniline ring is reduced to an ionized 2,3&#8208;dihydroaniline unit. Several alternative sequences, such as three successive 1,5&#8208;H shifts, could be excluded. A concomitant unidirectional 2H migration reaction of the ion 2 was also investigated and the intermediacy of ion&#8208;neutral complexes (INCs) enabling sequential hydride and proton transfer was confirmed by the calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Chiroptical Activity of &#960;&#8208;Expanded Electron&#8208;rich Heterohelicenes Based on the 1,4&#8208;Dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole core</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis and chiroptical characteristics of the first (double) helicenes possesing the 1,4&#8208;dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole (DHPP) moiety as their central core. We have developed a three&#8208;step synthesis with 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization accompanied with HBr elimination as its key step. We found that, whereas for smaller periphereal arms double 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization occurs smoothly forming a double helicene, in the case of longer policyclic aromatic hydrocarbons the reaction becomes less efficient and mono&#8208;helicenes are the only products. An analysis of the electron density distribution of LUMO explains the different regioselectivity of 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization. The synthesized heterohelicenes are characterized by greenish blue emission, distinct solvatofluorochromism and good fluorescence quantum yields (up to 42%). Moreover, the chiralooptical measurements reveal that unsymmetrical double heterohelicene exhibits excellent circularly polarized luminescence brightness (BCPL) reaching 30 M&#8722;1&#183;cm&#8722;1. The combined experimental and computational study has revealed that a charge&#8208;transfer state is responsible for the observed emission (hence the solvatochromism), while low&#8208;energy absorption derives from multiple transitions.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic&#8208;Liquid Synthesis of Atomic Molybdenum Nitride Clusters as Bifunctional Oxygen Reduction and Evolution Reactions Electrocatalysts for Alkaline Zn&#8211;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional molybdenum nitride (MoN) atomic cluster electrocatalyst, synthesized via an in&#8208;situ and ionic&#8208;liquid process, exhibits enhanced electrocatalytic activities for zinc&#8208;air batteries.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal nitrides (TMNs) have garnered considerable attention for energy conversion applications owing to their exceptional electronic structures and high catalytic activities. However, the scarcity of active sites in TMNs impedes their large&#8208;scale application. This study describes the use of wetness impregnation and ionic&#8208;liquid methods to enhance the electrocatalytic efficiency of molybdenum nitride (MoN) atomic clusters finely dispersed on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (MoN@NC) substrates. The as&#8208;synthesized electrocatalysts feature atomically dispersed MoN clusters, achieving an impressive onset potential of 0.93&#8197;V vs. RHE for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and maintaining an overpotential of just 295&#8197;mV at a current density of 10&#8197;mA/cm2 for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The MoN@NC&#8208;based zinc&#8211;air battery demonstrated a high&#8208;power density of 151&#8197;mW/cm2, a robust specific discharge capacity of 759 mAh/gZn at 20&#8197;mA/cm2, and superior charge&#8211;discharge cycling stability exceeding 190 cycles. The detailed experimental characterization revealed that the uniformly dispersed MoN clusters served as the primary active sites driving the observed catalytic performance. Additionally, the present findings suggested significant correlations between the phase of the material, crystallization, atomic cluster distribution, support porosity, and nitridation temperature. These insights are expected to refine strategies for achieving atomically dispersed nitrides with optimized ORR performance.

         <title>Structures of Gas&#8208;Phase Hydrated Phosphotyrosine Revealed by Soft X&#8208;ray Action Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gas&#8208;phase near&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption mass spectrometry (NEXAMS) reveals the effects of a single water molecule on protonated phosphotyrosine at the carbon and oxygen K&#8208;edges. The water molecule bonds with the phosphate group, altering the spectral features. Comparisons with density functional theory calculations identify three potential hydrated structures.







Abstract
Gas&#8208;phase near&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption mass spectrometry (NEXAMS) was employed at the carbon and oxygen K&#8208;edges to probe the influence of a single water molecule on the protonated phosphotyrosine molecule. The results of the photodissociation experiments revealed that the water molecule forms two bonds, with the phosphate group and another chemical group. By comparing the NEXAMS spectra at the carbon and oxygen K&#8208;edges with density functional theory calculations, we attributed the electronic transitions responsible for the observed resonances, especially the transitions due to the presence of the water molecule. We showed that the water molecule leads to a specific spectral feature in the partial ion yield of hydrated fragments at 536.4&#8197;eV. Moreover, comparing the NEXAMS spectra with the calculated structures allowed us to identify three possible structures for singly hydrated phosphotyrosine that agree with the observed fragmentation and resonances.

         <title>Ce[N(SiMe3)2]3(THF)3&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroboration of CO2, Esters and Epoxides with Pinacolborane: Selective Synthesis of Methanol in Multigram Scale</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a selective reduction of CO2 to methanol with HBpin in 99&#8201;% yield catalyzed by homoleptic cerium amide, establishing its potential as an excellent catalyst by preparing multigram&#8208;scale methanol. A practical application is also shown by reducing motorbike emitted CO2 to methanol. We also hydroborated challenging esters and reduced epoxides selectively.







Abstract
In this work, we have reduced CO2 with HBpin to afford borylated methanol product selectively in ~99&#8201;% yield using Ce[N(SiMe3)2]3(THF)3 as a catalyst. This led to multigram scale isolation of methanol obtained from CO2 reduction via the hydrolysis of borylated methanol, this establishes the potential of Ce[N(SiMe3)2]3(THF)3 as an efficient homogeneous catalyst for the bulk scale methanol synthesis. A practical application of this catalytic system was also shown by reducing CO2&#8208;containing motorbike exhaust efficiently and selectively. Further, C&#8722;O bond activation of esters and epoxides using HBpin and 1&#8211;2&#8197;mol&#8201;% of Ce[N(SiMe3)2]3(THF)3 at 60&#8201;&#176;C afforded the borylated alcohols in good to excellent yields, which can easily be hydrolysed to the eco&#8208;friendly corresponding alcohol. The stoichiometric experiments were performed to prove the formation of in&#8208;situ generated cerium hydride [Ce]&#8208;H as an active catalyst.

This work presents a modular chemo&#8208;optogenetic system using azobenzene&#8208;based photoswitchable molecular glues (sMGs) to reversibly control protein dimerization/proximity. This system enables reversible control of protein function using orthogonal green/blue and red/blue light







Abstract
Chemically induced dimerization/proximity (CID/CIP) systems controlled by chemical dimerizers (also known as molecular glues) provide valuable means for understanding and manipulating complex, dynamic biological systems. In this study, we present the development of versatile chemo&#8208;optogenetic systems utilizing azobenzene&#8208;based photoswitchable molecular glues (sMGs) for reversible protein dimerization controlled by visible light. These systems allow multiple cycles of light&#8208;induced dimerization, overcoming the limitations of irreversible photolysis in previous systems. Through optimizing photoswitch properties and linker strategies, we achieved efficient and reversible control using blue, green, and red light. We demonstrate that these systems enable rapid and reversible control of protein function in&#8197;vitro and in cells. The findings represent a significant advancement in chemo&#8208;optogenetics, offering opportunities to expand applications requiring precise spatiotemporal regulation of dynamic biological processes.

Two pairs of AIE&#8208;active TADF enantiomers were successfully designed and synthesized through isomer engineering. Notably, the CP&#8208;OLED devices, fabricated by solution&#8208;process, exhibited vivid CP&#8208;EL signals with the EQEmax of 2.7&#8201;%/10.2&#8201;%, low efficiency roll&#8208;off of 3.7&#8201;%/16.7&#8201;% at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 and |gEL| values of 6.73&#215;10&#8722;4/1.19&#215;10&#8722;3, respectively.







Abstract
Circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) have significant promise for naked&#8208;eye 3D displays. However, most devices are fabricated using vacuum deposition technology, and development of efficient solution&#8208;processed CP&#8208;OLEDs, particularly those exhibiting low efficiency roll&#8208;off, remains a formidable challenge. This research successfully designed and synthesized two pairs of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) enantiomers through isomer engineering, namely (R/S)&#8208;N&#8208;5&#8208;TPA and (R/S)&#8208;N&#8208;4&#8208;TPA, which features fifth and fourth substitution sites of phthalimide (acceptor) by tri&#8208;phenylamine (donor), respectively. Both molecules displayed aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties. Notably, the CP&#8208;OLED devices, fabricated by solution&#8208;process, exhibited vivid blue&#8208;green and green emission with the maximum current efficiency of 7.4 and 29.6&#8197;cd A&#8722;1, the external quantum efficiency of 2.7&#8201;% and 10.2&#8201;%, and the low efficiency roll&#8208;off of 3.7&#8201;% and 16.7&#8201;%. Moreover, these devices demonstrated CP&#8208;EL signals with gEL values of +6.61&#215;10&#8722;4 /&#8722;6.84&#215;10&#8722;4 and +1.13&#215;10&#8722;3/&#8722;1.25&#215;10&#8722;3, respectively.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;based Photocatalysis: From Fundamental Principles to Applications in the Generation of C&#8208;X (X = C, O, N, H, Si) Bond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over the past few decades, the merger of photocatalysis and transition metal&#8208;based catalysis or self&#8208;photoexcitation of transition metals has emerged as a useful tool in organic transformations. In this context, cobalt&#8208;based systems have attracted significant attention as sustainable alternatives to the widely explored platinum group heavy metals (iridium, rhodium, ruthenium) for photocatalytic chemical transformations. This review encompasses the basic types of cobalt&#8208;based homogeneous photocatalytic systems, their working principles, and the recent developments (2018&#8208;2024) in C&#8208;X (X = C, N, O, H, Si) bond formations. Noteworthy to mention that cobalt&#8208;based heterogeneous photocatalysis is beyond the scope of the present review. An elaborate presentation on the mechanistic intricacies of cobalt&#8208;based photocatalysis, without any external photocatalyst, and cobalt&#8208;based dual organophotoredox catalysis have been provided in this comprehensive review, excluding the dual&#8208;metal photoredox catalysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only contemporary review encompassing the aforementioned two major types of cobalt&#8208;based photocatalysis, in general synthetic chemistry, covering all types of C&#8208;X bond formations spanning a range of the last six years.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Effects of Fe3O4/N&#8208;Doped Porous Carbon Nanospheres for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing transition metal oxide (TMO)/porous carbon composite materials for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a promising strategy in high&#8208;performance fuel cell technology. In this study, we used the isolation effect and pore&#8208;creating properties of Zn2+ to fabricate a composite material comprising ultrasmall Fe3O4 particles anchored on hierarchically N&#8208;doped porous carbon nanospheres. This material, referred to as CPZ1.0&#8208;Fe0.1, serves as an efficient ORR electrocatalyst in alkaline fuel cells. CPZ1.0&#8208;Fe0.1 exhibits outstanding ORR catalytic activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.86 V in a 0.1 M KOH solution, surpassing that of the Pt/C catalyst (0.82 V). Furthermore, CPZ1.0&#8208;Fe0.1 exhibited excellent stability with minimal current degradation after 18 h of continuous testing. The superior ORR catalytic performance can be attributed to the synergistic effect between the catalytic sites and the high conductivity of porous carbon. The porous carbon nanospheres effectively address the low conductivity of Fe3O4 nanoparticles, while the ultra&#8208;small Fe3O4 nanoparticles anchored on the carbon surface provide efficient catalytic sites for the ORR.</dc:description>

         <title>Activation of the voltage&#8208;Gated Potassium channels by Amphiphilic Glycopeptides.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Voltage&#8208;gated ion channels (VGICs) are allosterically modulated by glycosaminoglycan proteoglycans and sialic acid glycans. However, the structural diversity and heterogeneity of these biomolecules pose significant challenges to precisely delineate their underlying structure&#8208;activity relationships. Herein, we demonstrate how heparan sulfate (HS) and sialic acid synthetic glycans appended on amphiphilic glycopeptide backbone influence cell membrane persistence and modulate the gating of the Kv2.1 channel. &#160;Utilizing a panel of amphiphilic glycopeptides comprising HS disaccharides and sialic acid trisaccharide glycans, we observed that sulfation of HS and flexible &#945;(2&#8208;6) sialylation result in prolonged persistence of glycopeptides on the cell membrane compared to non&#8208;sulfated HS and &#945;(2&#8208;3) sialylation respective. This variation in glycocalyx composition was associated with a noticeable difference in the effects of these compounds on the activation and inactivation properties of the voltage&#8208;gated Kv2.1 channel with our strongest membrane associating compound demonstrating the most potent channel&#8208;activation propensity. Our findings demonstrate that sulfation charges on glycopeptide play a critical role in their membrane association propensities and endow them with VGIC activation properties. and provide a valuable insight into the role of cell surface glycans in VGIC activities.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The 18e saturated rhodium(III) species [Rh(H)(X)(&#954;2&#8208;NSitBu2)(bipyMe2)] (NSitBu2 = {4&#8208;methylpyridine&#8208;2&#8208;yloxy}ditertbutylsilyl; bipyMe2 = 4,4&#180;&#8208;dimethylbipyridine) (X = Cl, 1; OTf, 2) have been prepared and characterized by NMR spectroscopy and in the case of 2 it has been possible to determine its solid&#8208;state structure by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Complex 1 has proven to be an effective catalyst precursor for the reaction of styrene derivatives with hydrosilanes in CD2Cl2. However, under catalytic conditions complex 2 decomposes. The performance of the 1&#8208;catalyzed reaction of styrene with hydrosilanes strongly depends on the nature of the silane, the best catalytic performance was achieved using HSiMe2Ph. Theoretical and 1H NMR studies indicate that the hemilabile nature of the NSi ligand is key to understanding the catalytic activity of compound 1.</dc:description>

         <title>Hysteresis Photomodulation within photochromic assemblies of [Dy(Tp2&#8208;py)F]+ Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets : Influence of the supramolecular magnetic couplings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A 1D coordination compound made of a photochromic dithienylethene linker and [Dy(Tp2&#8208;py)F]+ units (with Tp2&#8208;py = tris(3&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)pyrazolyl)hydroborate) and having tetrakis[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate counterions is reported. Full photoconversion from the closed isomer to the open isomer of the dithienyethene within single crystals allow for monitoring of the transformation by photocrystallography. Magnetic slow relaxation as well as magnetic hysteresis are observed and can be both modulated upon light irradiation. Comparison with previously published structures with similar components highlights the role of the supramolecular organization, and of dipolar couplings within these compounds, in driving the nature of the observed hysteresis photomodulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free Electrocatalysts for Selective Hydrogen Peroxide Generation via Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a versatile chemical widely used in various industries. The traditional anthraquinone method for H2O2 synthesis has environmental and safety concerns due to the use of organic solvents and hazardous by&#8208;products. The direct synthesis of H2O2 from H2 and O2 poses risks of flammability and explosion. Recently, the 2&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8208; ORR) method has emerged as a promising alternative, offering safety, environmental friendliness, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. This method utilizes gas diffusion electrodes to efficiently generate H2O2 without the need for additional dilution. In this review, we focus on the recent advancements in noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free materials for 2e&#8208; ORR electrocatalysis, which play a crucial role in the efficient production of H2O2. These materials, including transition metal compounds, macrocyclic complexes, carbon&#8208;based catalysts, framework materials, and MXene catalyst, demonstrate significant advantages in enhancing H2O2 yield. The development of these non&#8208;precious metal catalysts can reduce costs and improve sustainability and promote the commercialization of related technologies. The review concludes with an outlook on the future trends of 2e&#8208; ORR electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Mitochondrial Localization of Antioxidant Nanodrug Suppresses Ocular Inflammation by Alleviating Oxidative Stress on Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>External environments (e.g., pollutants, irritants, ultraviolet radiation, etc) probably activate oxidative stress on the ocular surface, further leading to inflammatory responses and cellular apoptosis. For treating ophthalmic diseases, one of the strategies is to regulate oxidative stress through antioxidants. Here we conjugate a polyphenolic antioxidant drug (i.e., caffeic acid) with a small peptide of protein tag to generate a peptide&#8208;drug conjugate as a nanodrug. With a self&#8208;assembled ability to form nanoparticles, the nanodrug mainly enters human corneal epithelial cells (HCEC) by caveolin&#8208;mediated endocytosis, succeeds lysosomal escape, and achieves mitochondrial localization of caffeic acid. Revealed by free radical scavenging experiments, the nanodrug shows considerable antioxidant capacities. In mouse leukemia cells of monocyte macrophage (RAW 264.7) induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the nanodrug inhibits various pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines (e.g., NO, IL&#8208;6, and TNF&#8208;&#945;) by up&#8208;regulating the expression of anti&#8208;apoptotic protein (e.g., Bcl&#8208;2). As an investigation of alleviating oxidative stress by the mitochondrial localization of antioxidant, this work may establish an experimental foundation for the regulation of cellular redox balance, as well as provide different insights for the clinical development of antioxidant drug delivery systems in the treatment of ocular disease.</dc:description>

         <title>Zirconium(IV)&#8208;Catalysed Hydrosilylation of Organic Carbonates and Polycarbonates Household Wastes into Alcohol Derivatives.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Schwartz&#8217;s reagent Cp2Zr(H)Cl is a well known stoichiometric reagent for the reduction of unsaturated organic molecules but it has rarely been used in catalytic transformations. Herein, we describe the reduction of a variety of organic carbonates using the catalyst Cp2Zr(H)Cl in combination with Me(MeO)2SiH (DMMS) as reductant. This method was further applied to the reductive depolymerization of some polycarbonate materials and yielded silylated alcohols and diols in mild conditions. This method for the recycling polycarbonates is characterized by its stability to the additives contained in household plastics as well as its ability to selectively depolymerize the polycarbonate PC&#8208;BPA when mixed with the polyester PET. Experimental investigations brought evidences on a mechanism based on the succession of a three steps sequence comprising the hydrozirconation of the carbonyl fragment, thermal &#963; C&#8211;O bond cleavage, and an ultimate Zr&#8211;OR/Si&#8211;H &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis reaction to regenerate the hydride catalyst.</dc:description>
