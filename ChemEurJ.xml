         <title>A Predictive Model for the Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Site&#8208;Selective Oxidation of Diols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A predictive model, shaped as a set of rules, is presented that predicts site&#8208;selectivity in the mono&#8208;oxidation of diols by palladium&#8208;neocuproine catalysis. For this, the factors that govern this site&#8208;selectivity within diols and between different diols have been studied both experimentally and with computation. It is shown that an electronegative substituent antiperiplanar to the C&#8211;H bond retards hydride abstraction, resulting in a lower reactivity. This explains the selective oxidation of axial hydroxy groups in vicinal cis&#8208;diols. Furthermore, DFT calculations and competition experiments show how the reaction rate of different diols is determined by their configuration and conformational freedom. The model has been validated by the oxidation of several complex natural products, including two steroids. From a synthesis perspective, the model predicts whether a natural product comprising multiple hydroxy groups is a suitable substrate for site&#8208;selective palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>A Concise Synthetic Approach to Highly Reactive Click&#8208;to&#8208;Release Trans&#8208;

Cyclooctene Linkers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An increase of the click&#8208;to&#8208;release reaction rate between cleavable trans&#8208;cyclooctenes (TCO
and tetrazines would be beneficial for drug delivery applications. In this work, we developed a
short and stereoselective synthesis route towards highly reactive sTCOs that serve as cleavable
linkers, affording quantitative tetrazine&#8208;triggered payload release. In addition, the 5&#8208;fold more
reactive sTCO exhibited the same in vivo stability as the parent TCO linker when used as
antibody linker in circulation in mice.</dc:description>

         <title>Deuteration Degree&#8208;Controllable Methylation via a Cascade Assembly Strategy using Methylamine&#8208;Water as Methyl Source</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a novel and effective photocatalytic method for the methylation of &#946;&#8208;diketones with controllable degrees of deuterium incorporation via development of new methyl sources. By utilizing a methylamine&#8208;water system as the methyl precursor and a cascade assembly strategy for deuteration degree control, we synthesized methylated compounds with varying degrees of deuterium incorporation, showcasing the versatility of this approach. We examined a range of &#946;&#8208;diketone substrates and synthesized key intermediates for drug and bioactive compounds with varying degrees of deuterium incorporation, ranging from 0 to 3. We also investigated and discussed the postulated reaction pathway. This work demonstrates the utility of readily available reagents, methylamines and water, as a new methyl source, and provides a simple and efficient strategy for the synthesis of degree&#8208;controllable deuterium&#8208;labelled compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Interconversion Based on Intramolecular Boroxine Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel structural interconversion unit based on intramolecular boroxine formation and hydrolysis has been developed. Owing to entropic factors, a macrocyclic triboronic acid and tricyclic boroxine can be dynamically interconverted by simple heating/cooling. The entropically stabilized tricyclic boroxine also shows high stability against hydrolysis.







Abstract
A novel structural interconversion unit based on intramolecular boroxine formation has been developed. A macrocyclic triboronic acid consisting of three phenylboronic acid units linked by covalent linkers preferentially underwent intramolecular rather than intermolecular boroxine formation, resulting in a quantitative formation of tricyclic boroxine. This structural transformation was accompanied by changes in the polarity, flexibility, and size of the molecule. Dynamic interconversion between the macrocyclic triboronic acid and the tricyclic boroxine was achieved by simple heating/cooling, whereas no boroxine formation occurred upon heating when three boronic acid units were not connected by linkers. Thermodynamic analysis revealed that the entropic advantage of the intramolecular boroxine formation process resulted in these unique features. The entropically stabilized tricyclic boroxine also shows high stability with respect to hydrolysis.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The simple class of dinuclear Mn(I) carbonyl compounds with phosphido (PR2&#8722;) and hydrido (H&#8722;) bridges has been known since the 1960&#8217;s. Only recently were they discovered to have potential catalytic applications. This Review is a fresh look the synthesis, reactivity, and catalysis of this interesting class of molecules.







Abstract
A class of organomanganese hydrogenation catalysts was recently rediscovered. These are simple dinuclear Mn(I) carbonyl compounds with phosphido (PR2&#8722;) and hydrido (H&#8722;) bridges. This class of compounds has been known since the 1960&#8217;s, and they have rich coordination chemistry and reactivity. Given their recently discovered potential for catalytic applications, a fresh look at this class of compounds was necessary. Hence, this Review comprehensively covers the synthesis, reactivity, and catalysis of this interesting class of molecules.

         <title>A DNA&#8208;Based Dissipation System that Synchronizes Multiple Fuels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA&#8208;based dissipation system with synchronized multiple molecular fuels provides multiple transient states and enhanced complexity. The dissipation system is harnessed to dynamically regulate the assembly of DNA nanotubes allowing for controlling the assembly kinetics by multiple fuels.







Abstract
Artificial dissipative networks have emerged as advanced bionic systems for the development of material technology and synthetic biology. Here, a DNA&#8208;based artificial dissipation system is demonstrated that synchronizes multiple energy&#8208;rich molecules (fuels) including oligonucleotide, dNTP, and ATP. The autonomous operation of the dissipation system relies on the integration of DNA reaction network including polymerase extension, kinase phosphorylation, and exonuclease digestion. The use of multiple fuels provides multiple transient states with different energy levels and fine&#8208;tuning dissipative kinetics. The lifetime of the transient state can be programmed to increase or decrease just by varying one of the fuel molecules unlike conventional DNA&#8208;based dissipative systems where the increase in the concentration of fuel molecule extends the lifetime. This design greatly expands the toolkits for establishing dissipative/dynamic DNA networks. The dissipation system is harnessed to dynamically regulate the assembly of DNA nanotubes allowing for controlling the assembly kinetics by multiple fuels. Owing to the multiple transient states in the dissipation system, two nanotubes can be regulated in parallel. It is envisioned that the system will find broad application in responsive materials, soft robotics, biosensors, and on&#8208;demand drug delivery.

         <title>A Template&#8208;Free Pd2L4 Cage with up to Nanomolar Affinity for Chloride in Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular halide catcher catches chloride exclusively from an aqueous solution containing the biologically most abundant essential anions. Multiple noncovalent interactions are involved in the deep enclosure of the designer self&#8208;assembled coordination cage for chloride binding. Impressively, chloride is captured with up to nanomolar affinity in aqueous solutions. More information can be found in the Research Article by D.&#8197;K. Chand and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300891).

         <title>Exploration of N&#8208;Arylation of Backbone Amides as a Novel Tool for Conformational Modification in Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As an inquisitive approach, cyclic peptides containing N&#8208;aryl alanine amino acids were synthesized. Their conformations in solution were determined by NMR spectroscopy and compared with those of other N&#8208;modified peptides. The compounds showed relatively high conformational homogeneity and populated well&#8208;characterized antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet structures having discrete &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;turns and hydrogen bonding patterns; these have been classified into different templates.







Abstract
A set of 15 cyclic&#8208;hexaalanine and 10 cyclic&#8208;pentaalanine peptides containing one or two backbone N&#8208;aryl amide bonds were synthesized by following a combination of solution&#8208;phase and solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. NMR&#8208;based conformation studies of these N&#8208;aryl cyclic&#8208;hexaalanine peptides revealed five distinct template conformations with an antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet structure; for N&#8208;aryl cyclic&#8208;pentaalanine peptides three template structures were revealed. All the template structures have distinct peptide&#8208;turn features. The conformations in these N&#8208;aryl peptides were compared to those in the commonly studied N&#8208;methyl peptide analogues. We observed that the N&#8208;aryl peptides exhibit a considerable conformational homogeneity, and their conformations differ significantly from those in N&#8208;methyl analogues. We anticipate that the N&#8208;arylation of backbone amides has the potential for application as a novel tool for conformation and physicochemical modification in peptides.

         <title>Persistent and Predominantly Localized Boron Radical from the Reduction of a Three&#8208;Dimensional Analogue of NHC&#8208;Stabilized Borafluorenium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The single&#8208;electron reduction of a 3D NHC&#8208;stabilized 9&#8208;borafluorenium cation leads to the formation of a persistent 3D 9&#8208;borafluorene radical that exhibits remarkable stability in both solid and solution states. Single crystal structure, EPR analysis, and theoretical studies indicate that the unpaired electron is predominantly located on boron.







Abstract
In this contribution, we reported the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) analogues of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;stabilized 9&#8208;borafluorenium and 9&#8208;borafluorene radical. The radical was fully characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV), UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. The distinct boron&#8208;centered radical character of 9&#8208;borafluorene radical was corroborated by DFT calculations and EPR analysis.

         <title>Organic Afterglow Nanoparticles in Bioapplications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic afterglow nanoparticles are unique optical materials that emit light long after cessation of excitation. Due to their advantages of no need for real&#8208;time light excitation, avoiding autofluorescence, low imaging background, high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio, deep tissue penetration, and high sensitivity, afterglow imaging technology has been widely used in cell tracking, biosensing, cancer diagnosis, and cancer therapy, which provides an effective technical method for the acquisition of molecular information with high sensitivity, specificity and real&#8208;time at the cellular and living level. In this review, we summarize and illustrate the recent progress of organic afterglow imaging, focusing on the mechanism of organic afterglow materials and their biological application. Furthermore, we also discuss the potential challenges and the further directions of this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Direction Switching and Self&#8208;recovering Mechanochromic Luminescence of Anthracene&#8208;modified o&#8208;Carboranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report luminochromic behaviors regarding mechanochromic luminescence (MCL) of o&#8208;carborane&#8208;modified anthracene derivatives. We have previously synthesized bis&#8208;o&#8208;carborane&#8208;substituted anthracene 1 and found that its crystal polymorph 1a show dual&#8208;emission properties composed of excimer and charge transfer (CT) emission bands in solid. Initially, we observed the bathchromic MCL behavior from 1a originating from emission mechanism alteration from dual emission to CT emission. By inserting the ethynylene spacers between anthracene and o&#8208;carboranes, compound 2 was obtained. Interestingly, 2 showed hypsochromic MCL originating from the emission mechanism alteration from CT to excimer emission. Furthermore, luminescent color of ground 1a can be recovered to the initial state by allowing to stand at room temperature, meaning that self&#8208;recovery proceeds. Detailed analyses are described in this study.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Bisubstrate Analogues for RNA Methylation Studies using two Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>RNA methyltransferases (RNA MTases) are a family of enzymes that catalyze the methylation of RNA using the cofactor S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine. While RNA MTases are promising drug targets, new molecules are needed to fully understand their roles in disease and to develop effective drugs that can modulate their activity. Since RNA MTases are suitable for bisubstrate binding, we report an original strategy for the synthesis of a new family of m6A MTases bisubstrate analogues. Six compounds containing a SAM analogue unit covalently tethered by a triazole ring to the N&#8208;6 position of an adenosine were synthesized. A procedure using two transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions was used to introduce the a&#8208;amino acid motif mimicking the methionine chain of the cofactor SAM. First, an iCuAAC reaction afforded the 5&#8208;iodo&#8208;1,4&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole which was functionalized by palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling&#160; to connect the a&#8208;amino acid substituent. Docking studies of our molecules in the active site of the m6A ribosomal MTase RlmJ show that the use of triazole as a linker provides additional interactions and the presence of the a&#8208;amino acid chain stabilizes the bisubstrate. The synthetic method developed here enhances the structural diversity of bisubstrate analogues to explore the active site of RNA modification enzymes and to develop new inhibitors.</dc:description>

         <title>Substitution Effects on the Photophysical and Photoredox Properties of Tetraaza[7]helicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of substituted derivatives of a tetraaza[7]helicenes were synthesized and the influence of the substitution on their photophysical and photoredox&#8208;catalytic properties was studied. The combination of their high fluorescence quantum yields of up to 0.65 and their circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity results in CPL brightness values (BCPL) that are among the highest recorded for [7]helicenes so far. A sulfonylation/hetarylation reaction using cyanopyridines as substrates for photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from the excited helicenes was conducted to test for viability in photoredox catalysis. DFT calculations predict the introduction of electron withdrawing substituents to yield more oxidizing catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>A Novel Nitridoborate Hydride Sr13[BN2]6H8 Elucidated from X&#8208;Ray and Neutron Diffraction Data</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal hydrides are an uprising compound class bringing up various functional materials. Due to the low X&#8208;ray scattering power of hydrogen, neutron diffraction is often crucial to fully disclose the structural characteristics thereof. We herein present the second strontium nitridoborate hydride known so far, Sr13[BN2]6H8, formed in a solid&#8208;state reaction of the binary nitrides and strontium hydride at 950&#160;&#176;C. The crystal structure was elucidated based on single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray and neutron powder diffraction in the hexagonal space group P63/m (no.176), exhibiting a novel three&#8208;dimensional network of [BN2]3&#8722; units and hydride anions connected by strontium cations. Further analyses with magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR and vibrational spectroscopy corroborate the presence of anionic hydrogen within the structure. Quantum chemical calculations reveal the electronic properties and support the experimental outcome. Sr13[BN2]6H8 expands the emerging family of nitridoborate hydrides, broadening the access to an open field of new, intriguing materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Sub&#8208;Nanochannels Formed Inside Solid&#8208;State Nanopore with Proton Ultra&#8208;High Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have the advantages of high porosity, angstrom&#8208;scale pore size, and unique structure. In this work, a kind of MOFs, UiO&#8208;66 and its derivatives (including aminated UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(NH2)2 and sulfonated UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(NH&#8208;SAG)2), were constructed on the inner surface of solid&#8208;state nanopores for ultra&#8208;selective proton transport. UiO&#8208;66 and UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(NH2)2 nanocrystal particles were in&#8208;situ grown at the orifice of glass nanopores firstly, which were used to investigate the ionic current responses in LiCl and HCl solutions when the monovalent anions (Cl&#8208;) were unchanged. Compared with UiO&#8208;66&#8208;modifed nanopores, the aminated MOFs modification (UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(NH2)2) can improve the proton selectivity obviously. However, when the UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(NH&#8208;SAG)2 nanopore is prepared by further post&#8208;modification with sulfo&#8208;acetic acid, lithium ions can hardly pass through the channel, and the interaction between protons and sulfonic acid groups can promote the transport of protons, thus achieving ultra&#8208;high selectivity to protons. This work provides a new way to achieve sub&#8208;nanochannels with high selectivity, which can widely be used in ion separation, sensing and energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational Study of Single Metal Atom Anchored on Black Phosphorus for Methane Oxidation to Methanol by Nitrous Oxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct conversion of methane to the high&#8208;value&#8208;added transportable chemicals is of great challenge, which requires high energy input to break the strong C&#8208;H bond. Developing efficient catalysts for methane oxidation to methanol under mild conditions is of vital importance. In this work, the single transition metal atoms (TM = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) anchored on black phosphorus (TM@BP) were studied as catalysts to assist the methane oxidation to methanol by means of first&#8208;principles calculations. The results indicate that Cu@BP exhibits an outstanding catalytic activity through the radical reaction pathways and the formation of the Cu&#8208;O active site is the rate&#8208;determining with an energy barrier of 0.48 eV. Meanwhile, electronic structure calculations and dynamic simulations show that Cu@BP offer excellent thermal stability. Our calculations provide a new approach for the rational design of single atom catalysts for methane oxidation to methanol.</dc:description>

         <title>Use of Biomass Glycerol as a Reducing Agent for Photocatalytic Deprotection of Pyridine N&#8208;Oxides in an Aqueous Suspension of Titanium(IV) Oxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deprotection of pyridine N&#8208;oxides under a mild condition with an inexpensive and environmentally friendly reducing reagent is important. The use of biomass waste as the reducing reagent, water as the solvent and solar light as the energy source is one of the most promising approaches with minimal impact on the environment. A TiO2 photocatalyst and glycerol successfully combine these items and stoichiometric deprotection of pyridine N&#8208;oxide (PyNO) with a minimal amount of glycerol (PyNO:glycerol= 7:1) was achieved, with only CO2 being produced as the final oxidation product of glycerol. The deprotection of PyNO is thermally accelerated. Under solar light, the temperature of the reaction system increased to 40&#8208;50oC and PyNO was also quantitatively deprotected, indicating that solar energy, i.e., UV light and thermal energy, can be effectively used. The results provide a new approach in the fields of organic chemistry and medical chemistry using biomass waste and solar light.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed para&#8208;selective alkylation of protected anilines to construct &#945;&#8208;arylacetonitrile skeletons has been reported.

A wide variety of &#945;&#8208;arylacetonitrile skeletons can be directly obtained with moderate to good yields. Importantly, the products contain both nitrile and ester groups guaranteeing its direct transformation into other useful synthetic units, indicating the synthetic importance of this method.</dc:description>

         <title>Through&#8208;Space, Lone&#8208;Pair Promoted Aromatic Substitution: A Relay Mechanism Can Beat Out Direct Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a detailed experimental and theoretical analysis of through&#8208;space arene activation with halogens, tetrazoles and achiral esters and amides. Contrary to previously assumed direct activation through &#963;&#8208;complex stabilization, our results suggest that these reactions proceed by a relay mechanism wherein the lone pair&#8208;containing activators form exothermic &#960;&#8208;complexes with electrophilic nitronium ion before transferring it to the probe ring through low barrier transition states. Noncovalent interactions (NCI) plots and Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) analyses depict favorable interactions between the Lewis base (LB) and the nitronium ion in the precomplexes and the transition states, suggesting directing group participation throughout the mechanism. The regioselectivity of substitution also comports with a relay mechanism. In all, these data pave the way for an alternate platform of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Protocell Self&#8208;Assembly Driven by Sodium Trimetaphosphate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphorus is not only an essential element for life but also an important activation component for multiple types of prebiotics on early Earth. Synergistic symbiosis between N&#8208;acyl amino acid (NAA)&#8208;type membrane precursor and peptide can be realized via sodium trimetaphosphate (P3m) activation effect based on the different activation mechanisms, which plays a significant role in the emergence of functionalized protocells.







Abstract
The co&#8208;evolution of peptide formation and membrane self&#8208;assembly is considered an essential step in the origin of life. However, more research is required on both processes, particularly on the interaction between prebiotic simple fatty&#8208;acid membranes and peptide synthesis. In this study, the sodium trimetaphosphate (P3m)&#8208;activated peptide formation reaction of phenylalanine (Phe) in an alkaline decanoic acid&#8208;decanol vesicle system was systematically investigated. The experimental results showed that peptide formation could competitively occur with N&#8208;acyl amino acid (NAA) formation. NAA formation did not follow the traditional P3m&#8208;activated peptide formation reaction involving the intermediate cyclic acylphosphoramidate (CAPA). Decanoic acid was activated by P3m to form a mixed anhydride, which then reacted with an amino acid to form the amide NAA. As a kind of membrane&#8208;forming amphiphile, NAA can form vesicles independently and reduce the critical vesicle concentration of the fatty&#8208;acid vesicles. Moreover, 11 other representative amino acids, namely alanine (Ala), aspartic acid (Asp), glutamic acid (Glu), glycine (Gly), isoleucine (Ile), leucine (Leu), proline (Pro), serine (Ser), threonine (Thr), valine (Val), and arginine (Arg), were selected for investigation. All of them reacted with decanoic acid to form NAA via the activation effect of P3m. The abovementioned mechanism involving P3m&#8208;activated carboxylic acid has not been reported in the literature. Our experimental results indicate that the participation of decanoic acid in the P3m activation&#8208;based peptide formation reaction system plays a significant role in the emergence of functionalized protocells. The P3m activation effect can provide diversified raw membrane materials to form and stabilize protocell membranes; moreover, the small peptides, such as Phe&#8208;Leu, formed in the same reaction system can induce the amplification of primitive cells. This implies that synergistic symbiosis between membrane and peptide can be realized via the P3m activation effect.

         <title>Reactivity of a Strictly T&#8208;Shaped Phosphine Ligated by an Acridane Derived NNN Pincer Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and reactivity of a strictly T&#8208;shaped phosphine derived from an NNN acridane pincer ligand is reported. Phosphorus&#8208;centered reactivity towards nucleophiles and electrophiles is observed, and the activation of hydridic and protic E&#8722;H bonds is demonstrated, including complete disassembly of water.







Abstract
The steric tuning of a tridentate acridane&#8208;derived NNN pincer ligand allows for the isolation of a strictly T&#8208;shaped phosphine that exhibits ambiphilic reactivity. Well&#8208;defined phosphorus&#8208;centered reactivity towards nucleophiles and electrophiles is reported, contrasting with prior reports on this class of compounds. Reactions towards oxidants are also described. The latter result in the two&#8208;electron oxidation of the phosphorus atom from +III to +V and are accompanied by a strong geometric distortion of the NNN pincer ligand. By contrast, cooperative activation of E&#8722;H (HCl, HBcat, HOMe) bonds proceeds with retention of the phosphorus redox state. When using H2O as a substrate, the reaction results in the full disassembly of H2O to its constituent atoms, highlighting the potential of this platform for small molecule activation reactions.

         <title>Investigations into Simplified Analogues of the Herbicidal Natural Product (+)&#8208;Cornexistin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(+)&#8208;Cornexistin has long been of interest to the crop protection community due to its interesting herbicidal profile and unique mode of action. However, the complex chemical structure of cornexistin has hindered further research into new analogues. Guided by an X&#8208;Ray co&#8208;crystal structure, we investigated simplified analogues of cornexistin that focused on the effects that the functional groups located on the right&#8208;hand side of the 9&#8208;membered ring have on herbicidal efficacy and target affinity.







Abstract
We report the design, synthesis and biological evaluation of simplified analogues of the herbicidal natural product (+)&#8208;cornexistin. Guided by an X&#8208;Ray co&#8208;crystal structure of cornexistin bound to transketolase from Zea mays, we attempted to identify the key interactions that are necessary for cornexistin to maintain its herbicidal profile. This resulted in the preparation of three novel analogues investigating the importance of substituents that are located on the nine&#8208;membered ring of cornexistin. One analogue maintained a good level of biological activity and could provide researchers insights in how to further optimize the structure of cornexistin for commercialization in the future.

         <title>In Vitro Selection and Characterization of a DNAzyme Probe for Diverse Pathogenic Strains of Clostridium difficile</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An RNA&#8208;cleavage fluorogenic DNAzyme has been made for recognizing diverse strains of Clostridium difficile that frequently cause an infectious disease known as C.&#8197;difficile infection (CDI). Upon encountering C.&#8197;difficile cells, this DNAzyme cuts itself to produce a fluorescent signal, thus making it useful as a molecular probe for CDI diagnosis. This DNAzyme is highly specific as it stays silent in the presence of several control bacterial cells. The DNAzyme has an intriguing secondary structure with a pseudoknot arrangement that is essential for its functionality. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Li and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300240).

         <title>An Amphiphilic Peptide Carrier for HCl Transport</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single molecules that co&#8208;transport cations as well as anions across lipid membranes are few despite their high biological utility. The elegant yet simple lipidomimetic peptide design herein enables efficient HCl transport without the use of any external additives for proton transport. The carboxylic acids in the dipeptide scaffold provide a handle to append two long hydrophobic tails and also provides a polar hydrophilic carboxylate group. The peptide central unit also provides NH sites for anion&#8208;binding. Protonation of the carboxylate group coupled with the weak halide binding of the terminal NH group results in HCl transport with transport rates of H+ &gt; Cl&#8254;. The lipid&#8208;like structure also facilitates seamless membrane integration and flipping of the molecule. The biocompatibility, design simplicity and potential pH regulation of these molecules open up several avenues for their therapeutic use.</dc:description>

         <title>Polycrystalline metal&#8208;organic framework membranes for separation of light hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to facile designability and versatile nanospace, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been considered as promising membrane materials. Compared with the mixed matrix membranes that incorporated with MOF particles, the polycrystalline MOF membranes demonstrates significant advantages in maximum utilizing the crystalline nanospace, and thus yielding a fruitful of achievements in the last twenty years.

         <title>EnT&#8208;Mediated Amino&#8208;Sulfonylation of Alkenes with Bifunctional Sulfonamides: Access to &#946;&#8208;Amino Sulfone Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#946;&#8208;Amino sulfones are commonly found structural motifs in biologically active compounds. Herein, we report a direct photocatalyzed amino&#8208;sulfonylation reaction of alkenes for the efficicient production of important compounds by simple hydrolysis without the need for additional oxidants and reductants. In this transformation, the sulfonamides worked as bifunctional reagents, simultaneously generating sulfonyl radicals and N&#8208;centered radicals which were added to alkene in a highly atom&#8208;economical fashion with high regioselectivity and diastereoselectivity. This approach showed high functional group tolerance and compatibility, facilitating the late&#8208;stage modification of some bioactive alkenes and sulfonamide molecules, thereby expanding the biologically relevant chemical space. Scaling up this reaction led to an efficient green synthesis of apremilast, one of the best&#8208;selling pharmceuticals, demonstrating the synthetic utility of the applied method. Moreover, mechanistic investigations suggest that an energy transfer (EnT) process was in operation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Benzene&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrathiolate (btt) has been used as a bridging ligand to prepare a redox active (molybdenocene dithiolene)&#8208;based bimetallic complex Cp2Mo(btt)MoCp2, which exhibits four successive electron transfers up to the tetracation. Spectro&#8208;electrochemical investigations together with DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations evidence that the two electroactive MoS2C2 metallacycles are electronically coupled in the monocationic as in the dicationic state. Two salts of the dication [Cp2Mo(btt)MoCp2]2+ have been structurally characterized with PF6&#8722; and HSO4&#8722; counterions, showing different chair or boat conformations associated with variable folding angles of the two MoS2C2 metallacycles along the S&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;S hinge. The bis&#8208;oxidized dicationic complex exhibits a diradical character, with both radicals essentially localized on the metallacycles and with antiferromagnetic coupling evidenced from magnetic susceptibility measurements.</dc:description>

         <title>The first Cu(I)&#8208;peptoid complex: enabling metal ion stability and selectivity via backbone helicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stabilization of Cu(I) is ubiquitous within native copper proteins. Understanding how to stabilize Cu(I) within synthetic biomimetic systems is therefore desired towards biological applications. Peptoids are an important class of peptodomimetics, that can bind metal ions and stabilize them in their high oxidation state. Thus, up to date, they were not used for Cu(I) binding. Here we show how the helical peptoid hexamer, having two 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (Bipy) groups that face the same side of the helix, forms the intramolecular air stable Cu(I) complex. Further study of the binding site by rigorous spectroscopic techniques suggests that Cu(I) is tetracoordinated, binding to only three N atoms from the Bipy ligands and to the N&#8208;terminus of the peptoid's backbone. A set of control peptoids and experiments indicates that the Cu(I) stability and selectivity are dictated by the intramolecular binding, forced by the helicity of the peptoid, which can be defined as the second coordination sphere of the metal center.</dc:description>

Transmission electron microscope (TEM) and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) reveal the formation of nanoparticles with narrow size distribution. Further investigation indicates a kinetically controlled self&#8208;assembly mechanism of the copolymers, in which the star topology of the amphiphilic copolymer and deep quenching condition by reverse solvent exchange are key to accelerate intrachain contraction of the copolymer during phase separation. When interchain contraction dominant over interchain association, nanoparticles with low aggregation number could be formed. Thanks to the high hydrophobic contents of the (PS&#8208;b&#8208;PEG)21 polymers, the resulted nanoparticles could encapsulate a high capacity of hydrophobic cargo up to 19.84%.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Decorated Nonaromatic Amine Emitters Towards Efficient Triplet Exciton Utilization in Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 29, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Possessed powerful electron&#8208;donating ability and strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling, sulfur atom is particularly attractive for boosting triplet exciton utilization in electroluminescence. Here, the sulfur&#8208;decorated nonaromatic amine compounds served as thermally activated delayed fluorescence and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence emitters for highly efficient OLED applications are highlighted.







Abstract
Purely organic compounds served as promising materials for organic electronics have intrigued extensive research focuses owing to their unique photophysical and electronic properties. In the field of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), the utilization of triplet excitons is of great significance for realizing high&#8208;performance devices. In contrast to the traditional aromatic amine&#8208;based counterparts, sulfur atom with a high&#8208;level outer orbit simultaneously provides powerful electron&#8208;donating ability and striking spin&#8208;orbit coupling effect to facilitate the utilization of theoretically spin&#8208;forbidden triplet excitons, demonstrating great prospect in constructing highly emissive purely organic emitters for OLED applications. Herein, we summarize the currently developed sulfur&#8208;decorated nonaromatic amine&#8208;based emitters exhibiting attractive photoelectronic characteristics, and gain insight into the understanding of molecular design and photophysical processes of these emitters, providing new perspectives for enriching the existing luminescent material systems and designing high&#8208;performance emitters.

         <title>Metal Complex Molecular Junctions as Thermoelectric Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 29, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular junctions, which are composed of metal electrode&#8208;molecule&#8208;metal electrode structures, are attractive components of thermoelectric devices. In this Concept article, we discuss recent thermoelectric studies on metal complex junctions. Furthermore, the potential utility of functional metal complex junctions for thermoelectric devices is also described.







Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule junctions and self&#8208;assembled monolayer junctions are attractive architectures for thermoelectric devices. However, given the poor thermoelectric performance of organic molecules investigated so far, molecules characterized by high conductance and Seebeck coefficient values are desired to be explored. Metal complexes are promising possible active components of high&#8208;performance thermoelectric devices given that metal&#8208;ligand combinations and functions can be made to vary to modulate the transmission functions, thus strongly influencing conductance and Seebeck coefficient. In this concept article are described recent studies wherein thermoelectric measurements were conducted on metal complex junctions. Furthermore, the potential for the use of the junctions in thermoelectric devices is discussed.

Metal complexes are promising possible active components of high-performance thermoelectric devices given that metal-ligand combinations and functions can be made to vary to modulate the transmission functions, thus strongly influencing conductance and Seebeck coefficient. In this concept article are described recent studies wherein thermoelectric measurements were conducted on metal complex junctions. Furthermore, the potential for the use of the junctions in thermoelectric devices is discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fine Tuning the Properties of Stapled Peptides by Stereogenic &#945;&#8208;Amino Acid Bridges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 29, May 22, 2023. </description>

&#945;&#8208;Amino Acids were used as bridges to construct side chain&#8208;stapled analogs library of an IL&#8208;17A&#8208;binding peptide (HAP) and evaluated the staples chirality (L/D) impacts on the peptide&#8216;s properties. While all AA&#8208;derived peptidyl staples drastically increase the enzymatic stability of HAP, the L&#8208;AA&#8208;based staples generate more significant impacts in increasing the helicity and binding affinity of the modified peptide compared to the D&#8208;amino acid bridges.







Abstract
Peptide stapling represents a versatile strategy to generate peptide derivatives with stable helical structures. While a wide range of skeletons have been investigated for cyclizing the side chains of peptides, the stereochemical outcomes from the linkers remain to be better understood. In this study, we incorporated &#945;&#8208;amino acids (&#945;&#8208;AAs) as bridges to construct side chain&#8208;stapled analogs of an interleukin&#8208;17A&#8208;binding peptide (HAP) and evaluated the impacts of the staples on the peptide's properties. While all AA&#8208;derived peptidyl staples drastically increase the enzymatic stability of HAP, our results indicate that compared to the D&#8208;amino acid bridges, the L&#8208;AA&#8208;based staples may generate more significant impacts in increasing the helicity and enhancing the interleukin&#8208;17A(IL&#8208;17A)&#8208;binding affinity of the modified peptide. Using Rosetta modelling and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we demonstrate that the chirality (L/D) possessed within the AAs substantially influences the conformation of stapled HAP peptides, providing either stabilizing or destabilizing effects. Based on the computational model, a modification of the stapled HAP leads to the discovery of a peptide with further enhanced helicity, enzymatic stability and IL&#8208;17A&#8208;inhibiting ability. This systematic study reveals that chiral AAs can serve as modulatory linkers for optimizing the structures and properties of stapled peptides.

         <title>Significant Control on Zero&#8208;Field Quantum Tunneling of Magnetization in Dysprosium Based Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets via Orientation of the Anilato Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 29, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bridging ligand orientation in a dinuclear Dy(III) complex provides different coordination geometry. The geometry with higher axial symmetry (pseudo square antiprism) around DyIII centre gives higher energy barrier (Ueff) than the low order symmetric geometry [triangular dodecahedron geometry (pseudo D2d)] due to the large difference in their transverse anisotropy.







Abstract
Tuning the bridging fashion of anilato ligand in dinuclear DyIII complexes, reveals a sizable effect on the slow relaxation of magnetization. Combined experimental and theoretical studies divulge that the geometry with high order axial symmetry (pseudo square antiprism) reduces the transverse crystal fields corresponding to QTM (quantum tunneling of magnetization) resulting in a significant increase in energy barrier (Ueff=518&#8197;cm&#8722;1) through the Orbach relaxation process whereas the geometry with lower symmetry (triangular dodecahedron, pseudo D2d) enhances the transverse crystal fields that accelerate the ground state QTM process. Notably, the value 518&#8197;cm&#8722;1 represents the highest energy barrier among anilato ligand based SMMs.

         <title>Vanadium Pentafulvene Complexes: Synthon for Unprecedented VanadoceneIII Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 29, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The benzene ligand at CpV(&#951;6&#8722;C6H6) is exchanged with pentafulvenes to yield the first vanadium complexes with a &#960;&#8208;&#951;5:&#963;&#8208;&#951;1 coordinating pentafulvene. Consecutive reactivity studies concerning element&#8208;H activation and insertion reactions of multiple bond containing substrates produced rare examples of vandoceneIII phenolate, alcoholate, and amide complexes with certain structure elucidation by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.







Abstract
The benzene ligand at CpV(&#951;6&#8722;C6H6) (1) is exchanged for pentafulvenes. Using sterically demanding pentafulvenes gives a clean exchange reaction, yielding vanadium pentafulvene (2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b) and benzofulvene complexes (3&#8201;a and 3&#8201;b). The molecular structures of the target compounds suggest a &#960;&#8208;&#951;5:&#963;&#8208;&#951;1 coordination mode with a vanadiumIII center. With the sterically low demanding 6,6&#8208;dimethylpentafulvene, a C&#8722;H activation at the leaving ligand is observed, yielding the ring&#8208;substituted vanadoceneII 4. The reactivity of the pentafulvene complexes was investigated. A series of unprecedented vanadoceneIII compounds were synthesized: Under mild conditions, E&#8722;H splitting of 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenol, diphenylamine, and 2,6&#8208;diisopropylaniline yield well characterized examples of rare vanadoceneIII phenolate and amide complexes. Insertion reactions into the V&#8722;Cexo bond of the pentafulvene complexes by multiple bond containing substrates were found for acetone, 4&#8208;chlorobenzonitril and N,N&#8217;&#8208;dicyclohexylcarbodiimide.

         <title>Structure Based Discovery of Inhibitors of CYP125 and CYP142 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 29, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structure&#8208;based drug design process is used to build inhibitors for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) cholesterol oxidase enzymes CYP125 and CYP142. Elaboration of initial fragment screen used an iterative approach combining high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray structures, biophysical characterization, and structure&#8208;activity relationships (SAR). The resulting compounds yielded potent micromolar cellular activity against clinically relevant drug resistant Mtb strains.







Abstract
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) was responsible for approximately 1.6 million deaths in 2021. With the emergence of extensive drug resistance, novel therapeutic agents are urgently needed, and continued drug discovery efforts required. Host&#8208;derived lipids such as cholesterol not only support Mtb growth, but are also suspected to function in immunomodulation, with links to persistence and immune evasion. Mtb cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes facilitate key steps in lipid catabolism and thus present potential targets for inhibition. Here we present a series of compounds based on an ethyl 5&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;1H&#8208;indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate pharmacophore which bind strongly to both Mtb cholesterol oxidases CYP125 and CYP142. Using a structure&#8208;guided approach, combined with biophysical characterization, compounds with micromolar range in&#8208;cell activity against clinically relevant drug&#8208;resistant isolates were obtained. These will incite further development of much&#8208;needed additional treatment options and provide routes to probe the role of CYP125 and CYP142 in Mtb pathogenesis.

A predictive DFT study of L&#8594;Al(ORF)3 (L=Lewis bases) adducts allowed the identification of (iPr2S)&#8594;Al(ORF)3 as a &#8220;stable yet reactive&#8221; adduct, able to act as a masked Lewis superacid. It provides a novel strategy to use M&#8208;ORF/L&#8594;Al(ORF)3 couples to generate catalytically active M+ centers featuring weakly coordinating aluminate counter anion.







Abstract
A DFT study of several L&#8594;Al(ORF)3 (L=Lewis bases) adducts allowed the identification of (iPr2S)&#8594;Al(ORF)3 1&#8208;SiPr2 as a &#8220;stable yet reactive&#8221; adduct. 1&#8208;SiPr2 was shown to act as a masked Lewis superacid able to release Al(ORF)3 under mild conditions. It could be used to abstract a ORF&#8722; ligand from (bipyMe2)Ni(ORF)2 (bipyMe2&#8201;:&#8201;6,6&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;dipyridyl) and generate the nickel alkoxide complex [(bipyMe2)Ni(ORF)(iPr2S)]+[(RFO)3Al&#8722;F&#8722;Al(ORF)3]&#8722; 5. Ligand exchange of iPr2S by Ph3P yielded [(bipyMe2)Ni(ORF)(PPh3)]+[(RFO)3Al&#8722;F&#8722;Al(ORF)3]&#8722; 6.

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization and Singlet Fission Behaviors of Heteroatom&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons with (&#946;, &#946;) Connected Furan/Thiophene Ring</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 29, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported the synthesis, characterization and basic physiochemical properties of two novel heteroatom&#8208;doped PAHs (BTF and BTT). The studies on their singlet fission (SF) show that the efficiency of BTT is higher than that of BTF by two times while the triplet generation time of BTT becomes slower compared with BTF, indicating that the introduction of sulfur atom has a significant influence on the SF process.







Abstract
Singlet fission (SF) has been proven to be an effective strategy to overcome the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit of photovoltaics. However, the materials suitable for SF are relatively rare due to the strict requirements for the occurrence of this process. In the present study, we report the first preparation of two heteroatoms (O and S)&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) molecules with (&#946;, &#946;) connected furan/thiophene ring. The optical and physiochemical properties of both compounds are investigated by a variety of spectroscopies, including UV&#8211;vis absorption, photoluminescence and cyclic voltammetry. In addition, their ultrafast excited state dynamics are studied by femtosecond transient absorption. Experimental data showed that the singlet fission efficiency was improved by 2&#8197;times when replacing oxygen with sulfur atom, which could provide some guidelines in designing singlet fission materials with better efficiency.

         <title>CO&#8208;Preserving Photoinduced Transfer of Cymantrenyl Moiety: a Tandem Experimental and Computational Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 29, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The non&#8208;exchangable CO: When one observes that the reaction product contains the same quantity of CO ligands as the substrate, it is natural to suspect that they do not detach during the reaction. We present a reaction where this is not the case and highlight the role of cage effect in this conundrum.







Abstract
Cyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (cymantrene) is known to undergo photochemical reactions by releasing one of its CO ligands. Here we present the first example of a photorearrangement of a cymantrenylmethyl fragment, where it retains all its three CO ligands. A tandem experimental and DFT (density functional theory)&#8208;based computational investigation allows us to explain this unexpected behavior: the rearrangement, indeed, begins with the release of one CO ligand, but cage effect of the solvent captures this CO molecule, allowing it to rapidly reattach once the rearrangement takes place.

         <title>Regulation of the Oxidase Mimetic Activity of Ceria Nanoparticles by Buffer Composition</title>

Nanozymes: The buffer compositions have different effects on the oxidase mimetic activity of ceria nanoparticles.







Abstract
Ceria nanoparticles (CNPs) are important typical nanozymes with multiple enzyme mimetic activities, which could facilitate the oxidation of organic dyes in acidic conditions, because of the oxidase mimetic activity. Usually, the regulation of oxidase mimetic activity is focused on the adjustment of the structure, morphology, composition, surface, and other factors of nanozymes. However, the influence of the surrounding environment is not considered, which is very important during the reaction process. In this work, the oxidase mimetic activity of CNPs in buffer solutions including citric acid, acetic acid and glycine buffer solutions was investigated, with the results that carboxyl group in buffer solution could adsorb the CNPs on the surface to promote the oxidase mimetic activity. Due to the chelation with the cerium ion, the enhancement is more significant by molecules with polycarboxylic groups, and the enhancement is more efficient by carboxyl molecules in buffer solution, compared with the modification of the carboxyl groups on the surface, because of easier operation and smaller steric hindrance. From the viewpoint of increasing the oxidase mimetic activity of CNPs, the work is expected to provide references for the selection of the reaction systems to optimize the oxidase mimetic activity in bio&#8208;detection applications.

         <title>No Transition Metals Required &#8211; Oxygen Promoted Synthesis of Imines from Primary Alcohols and Amines under Ambient Conditions</title>

Transition&#8208;metal free: The synthesis of imines from benzyl alcohol and anilines promoted by oxygen and KOtBu at room temperature in the absence of a transition metal catalyst is described. The detailed investigation of the radical mechanism is presented revealing complex reaction paths and branching patterns.







Abstract
The synthesis of imines denotes a cornerstone in organic chemistry. The use of alcohols as renewable substituents for carbonyl&#8208;functionality represents an attractive opportunity. Consequently, carbonyl moieties can be in&#8197;situ generated from alcohols upon transition&#8208;metal catalysis under inert atmosphere. Alternatively, bases can be utilized under aerobic conditions. In this context, we report the synthesis of imines from benzyl alcohols and anilines, promoted by KOtBu under aerobic conditions at room temperature, in the absence of any transition&#8208;metal catalyst. A detailed investigation of the radical mechanism of the underlying reaction is presented. This reveals a complex reaction network fully supporting the experimental findings.

During the last three decades, silicon&#8208;bridged [1]ferrocenophanes were developed into an important class of monomers with the Me2Si&#8208;bridged [1]ferrocenophane being the most applied member. Surprisingly, the strained ruthenocene analogues are unknown. We now solved this mystery and reveal why sila[1]ruthenocenophanes are so challenging to prepare.







Abstract
During the last three decades, silicon&#8208;bridged [1]ferrocenophanes have been developed into an important class of monomers with the resulting polymers being the subject of hundreds of publications. For unknown reasons, not a single example of a silicon&#8208;bridged [1]ruthenocenophane is described in the literature. We set out to address this mystery and could synthesize the first sila[1]ruthenocenophanes. Their molecular structures as well as their heat release in the melt, render them as highly strained sandwich compounds that are polymerizable. Why did it take so long to prepare the first sila[1]ruthenocenophanes? This question is addressed by a detailed analysis of the kinetics of the salt&#8208;metathesis approach, which reveals a striking difference between ferrocene and ruthenocene.

         <title>Structural Dissection of Epsin&#8208;1 N&#8208;Terminal Helical Peptide: The Role of Hydrophobic Residues in Modulating Membrane Curvature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 29, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The induction of local changes in membrane structure often plays a pivotal role for cellular life. Epsin&#8208;1 is a representative protein to induce positive membrane curvature and its N&#8208;terminal segment (EpN18) plays a key role. This study aimed to elucidate the essential structural features of EpN18 for a better understanding of general curvature&#8208;modulating mechanisms and to design effective tools for rationally controlling membrane structure.







Abstract
Spatiotemporal structural alterations in cellular membranes are the hallmark of many vital processes. In these cellular events, the induction of local changes in membrane curvature often plays a pivotal role. Many amphiphilic peptides are able to modulate membrane curvature, but there is little information on specific structural factors that direct the curvature change. Epsin&#8208;1 is a representative protein thought to initiate invagination of the plasma membrane upon clathrin&#8208;coated vesicles formation. Its N&#8208;terminal helical segment (EpN18) plays a key role in inducing positive membrane curvature. This study aimed to elucidate the essential structural features of EpN18 in order to better understand general curvature&#8208;inducing mechanisms, and to design effective tools for rationally controlling membrane curvature. Structural dissection of peptides derived from EpN18 revealed the decisive contribution of hydrophobic residues to (i)&#8197;enhancing membrane interactions, (ii)&#8197;helix structuring, (iii)&#8197;inducing positive membrane curvature, and (iv)&#8197;loosening lipid packing. The strongest effect was obtained by substitution with leucine residues, as this EpN18 analog showed a marked ability to promote the influx of octa&#8208;arginine cell&#8208;penetrating peptides into living cells.

         <title>Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Decarbonylative Borylation of Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 29, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Rh catalyzed method for direct decarbonylative borylation of carboxylic acid has been developed. This protocol exhibits a wide scope, is scalable and successfully used to late&#8208;stage diversification of many carboxylic acid containing drugs. One&#8208;pot borylation/derivatization reaction was also achieved and may open the door to explore new transformation from carboxylic acid.







Abstract
Carboxylic acids are abundant, low cost and environmentally friendly, direct convert carboxylic acids into valued&#8208;added compounds are in high demand. Herein, we report a Rh(I) catalyzed direct decarbonylative borylation of aryl and alkyl carboxylic acid using TFFH as activator. This protocol features excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance and a broad substrate scope including natural product and drugs. A gram&#8208;scale decarbonylative borylation reaction of Probenecid is also presented. In addition, the utility of this strategy is highlighted by a one&#8208;pot decarbonylative borylation/ derivatization sequence.

         <title>Boosting Hydrostability and Carbon Dioxide Capture of Boroxine&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks by One&#8208;Pot Oligoamine Modification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 29, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Killing two birds with one stone. The representative of boroxine&#8208;linked COFs, COF&#8208;1, is modified with an oligoamine by one&#8208;pot condensation. The modification with the oligoamine not only boosts the water stability of COF&#8208;1, but also significantly increases its CO2 uptake capacity and CO2/N2 selectivity, especially in low pressure region. These advantages make the oligoamine&#8208;modified COF&#8208;1 suitable for capturing CO2 from humid flue gas.







Abstract
Boron&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are susceptible to nucleophilic attack by water at the electron&#8208;deficient boron sites and even slightly humid air could destroy the integrity of their porous frameworks within hours. Such instability is a major limitation to the practical applications of boron&#8208;based COFs. Herein we report a significant enhancement of hydrostability of boroxine&#8208;linked COFs (COF&#8208;1 as representative) by modification with an oligoamine (tetraethylenepentamine, TEPA), which leads to survival of the modified COF in water and long&#8208;time stability under humid atmosphere. Meanwhile, the TEPA modification also results in a considerable increase in CO2 adsorption capacity up to 13&#8197;times and a dramatic improvement in CO2/N2 selectivity in low pressure region, which make the modified COF suitable for capturing CO2 from flue gas. This work provides a facile, efficient, and scalable method to greatly improve hydrostability of boroxine&#8208;linked COFs and reshape them into high&#8208;performance CO2 adsorbents.

         <title>C&#8722;H Functionalization of Heterocycles with Triplet Carbenes by means of an Unexpected 1,2&#8208;Alkyl Radical Migration

A triplet carbene is involved in the C3&#8208;H functionalization of indole heterocycles. We herein describe a combined experimental and computational study on this reaction and unveil an unexpected 1,2&#8208;alkyl radical migration pathway.







Abstract
The C&#8722;H functionalization of indole heterocycles constitutes a key strategy to leverage the synthesis of endogenous signaling molecules such as tryptamine or tryptophol. Herein, we report on the photocatalytic reaction of ethyl diazoacetate with indole, which shows an unusual solvent dependency. While C2&#8208;functionalization occurs under protic conditions, the use of aprotic solvents leads to a complete reversal of selectivity and exclusive C3&#8208;functionalization occurs. To rationalize for this unexpected reactivity switch, we have conducted detailed theoretical and experimental studies, which suggest the participation of a triplet carbene intermediate that undergoes initial C2&#8208;functionalization. A distinct cationic [1,2]&#8208;alkyl radical migration then leads to formation of C3&#8208;functionalized indole. We conclude with the application of this photocatalytic reaction to access oxidized tryptophol derivatives including gram&#8208;scale synthesis and derivatization reactions.

The best of both worlds: Water solubility of Zn16Ln(pyzHA)16 (H2pyzHA: pyrazine hydroxamic acid) or lower energy excitation of Zn16Ln(quinoHA)16 (H2quinoHA: quinoxaline hydroxamic acid) metallacrowns (MCs)? No need to choose! In water soluble mixed&#8208;ligand Zn16Yb(pyzHA)x(quinoHA)16&#8211;x MCs characteristic emission of YbIII in the near&#8208;infrared range can be sensitized upon excitation up to 600&#8197;nm in the solid state or 500&#8197;nm in aqueous solution.







Abstract
By combining advantages of two series of lanthanide(III)/zinc(II) metallacrowns (MCs) assembled using pyrazine&#8208; (pyzHA2&#8722;) and quinoxaline&#8208; (quinoHA2&#8722;) hydroximate building blocks ligands, we created here water&#8208;soluble mixed&#8208;ligand MCs with extended absorption to the visible range. The YbIII analogue demonstrated improved photophysical properties in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) range in cell culture media, facilitating its application for NIR optical imaging in living HeLa cells.

         <title>Determinative Effect of Axial Linearity on Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet Performance in Dinuclear Dysprosium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 29, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The manipulation of axial linearity in two dichloride&#8208;bridged dinuclear dysprosium(III) complexes could be managed by adjusting the diamine substituent on the salen ligand, which directly determines the single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) performance. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that collinear/parallel anisotropic axes of two DyIII ions can enable zero&#8208;dc&#8208;field quantum tunneling of magnetization (QTM) effect.







Abstract
Two dichloride&#8208;bridged dinuclear dysprosium(III) complexes based on salen ligands, namely, [Dy(L1)(&#956;&#8208;Cl)(thf)]2 (1; H2L1=N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsalicylidene)phenylenediamine) and [Dy2(L2)2(&#956;&#8208;Cl)2(thf)2]2 (2; H2L2=N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsalicylidene)ethylenediamine) are reported. These two complexes have two short Dy&#8722;O(PhO) bonds that exhibit angles of &#8764;90&#176; for 1 and &#8764;143&#176; for 2, leading to clear slow relaxation of the magnetization for 2 and not for 1. Compound 2 has a near&#8208;identical core to the recently reported compound [Dy2(L3)2(&#956;&#8208;Cl)2(thf)2] (3; H2L3=N&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;bis(2&#8242;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzyl)amine). The only substantial difference is the relative angle of the two O(PhO)&#8722;Dy&#8722;O(PhO) vectors, which is collinear in 2 owing to inversion symmetry and &#8764;68&#176; in 3 due to a molecular C2 axis. It is shown that this subtle structural difference leads to large differences in the dipolar ground states, giving rise to open magnetic hysteresis for 3 and not for 2.

         <title>CryoEM Structure with ATP Synthase Enables Late&#8208;Stage Diversification of Cruentaren&#8197;A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 29, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pattern for a new design: The cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) structure of cruentaren&#8197;A bound to ATP synthase is reported; it facilitated the design of new inhibitors through semisynthetic modification. Cruentaren&#8197;A derivatives were developed, and a trans&#8208;alkene isomer was found to exhibit similar activity to cruentaren&#8197;A against three cancer cell lines as well as other analogues that still retained potent inhibitory activity.







Abstract
Cruentaren&#8197;A is a natural product that exhibits potent antiproliferative activity against various cancer cell lines, yet its binding site within ATP synthase remained unknown, thus limiting the development of improved analogues as anticancer agents. Herein, we report the cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) structure of cruentaren&#8197;A bound to ATP synthase, which allowed the design of new inhibitors through semisynthetic modification. Examples of cruentaren&#8197;A derivatives include a trans&#8208;alkene isomer, which was found to exhibit similar activity to cruentaren&#8197;A against three cancer cell lines as well as several other analogues that retained potent inhibitory activity. Together, these studies provide a foundation for the generation of cruentaren&#8197;A derivatives as potential therapeutics for the treatment of cancer.

Galliumhalosilanes: Synthesis of a first compound comprises two differently coordinated gallium atoms. Where one gallium presents between two silylene and the other gallium is only coordinated by one silylene. The oxidation state of the gallium and silicon atoms remains the same even after the reduction. Further reaction of silylene with boron halide leads to the formation of silylene&#8208;boron adduct.







Abstract
Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot reaction of gallium and boron halides with potassium graphite in the presence of benzamidinate stabilized silylene LSi&#8208;R, (L=PhC(NtBu)2). The reaction of LSiCl with an equivalent amount of GaI3 in the presence of KC8 leads to the direct substitution of one chloride group by gallium diiodide simultaneously additional coordination of silylene resulted in L(Cl)Si&#8594;GaI2&#8208;Si(L)&#8594;GaI3 (1). In compound 1, the structure comprises two differently coordinated gallium atoms where one gallium presents between two silylenes and the other gallium is only coordinated by one silylene. In this Lewis acid&#8208;base reaction the oxidation states of the starting materials remain unchanged. The same is valid in the silylene boron adduct formation of L(tBu)Si&#8208;BPhCl2 (2) and L(tBu)Si&#8208;BBr3 (3). This new route provides access to galliumhalosilanes challenging to synthesize by any other method.

         <title>Substituent Effects in Bioorthogonal Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions of 1,2,4,5&#8208;Tetrazines</title>

Non&#8208;frontier molecular orbital interaction&#8208;controlled reactivity: The reactivity of 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazines in inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder cycloadditions is often described by using frontier molecular orbital (FMO) theory. We show that FMO interactions play a minuscule role in the reactivity difference between commonly used scaffolds. Instead, Pauli repulsion is often the deciding factor.







Abstract
1,2,4,5&#8208;Tetrazines are increasingly used as reactants in bioorthogonal chemistry due to their high reactivity in Diels&#8211;Alder reactions with various dienophiles. Substituents in the 3&#8208; and 6&#8208;positions of the tetrazine scaffold are known to have a significant impact on the rate of cycloadditions; this is commonly explained on the basis of frontier molecular orbital theory. In contrast, we show that reactivity differences between commonly used classes of tetrazines are not controlled by frontier molecular orbital interactions. In particular, we demonstrate that mono&#8208;substituted tetrazines show high reactivity due to decreased Pauli repulsion, which leads to a more asynchronous approach associated with reduced distortion energy. This follows the recent Vermeeren&#8211;Hamlin&#8211;Bickelhaupt model of reactivity increase in asymmetric Diels&#8211;Alder reactions. In addition, we reveal that ethylene is not a good model compound for other alkenes in Diels&#8211;Alder reactions.

&lt;p&gt;1,2,4,5-Tetrazines are increasingly used as reactants in bioorthogonal chemistry due to their high reactivity in Diels&#8211;Alder reactions with various dienophiles. Substituents in the 3- and 6-positions of the tetrazine scaffold are known to have a significant impact on the rate of cycloadditions; this is commonly explained on the basis of frontier molecular orbital theory. In contrast, we show that reactivity differences between commonly used classes of tetrazines are not controlled by frontier molecular orbital interactions. In particular, we demonstrate that mono-substituted tetrazines show high reactivity due to decreased Pauli repulsion, which leads to a more asynchronous approach associated with reduced distortion energy.

The one&#8208;pot protocol involving the in&#8197;situ generation of &#945;&#8208;amino ketones via the nucleophilic substitution of &#945;&#8208;bromoketones with amines and the Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of ketone intermediates was developed for the asymmetric synthesis of a diverse array of chiral &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols with excellent results.







Abstract
A straightforward synthesis approach to chiral 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;2&#8208;aminoethanols via the one&#8208;pot asymmetric hydrogenation catalyzed by Ir catalyst was developed. This tandem process involves the in&#8197;situ generation of &#945;&#8208;amino ketones via the nucleophilic substitution of &#945;&#8208;bromoketones with amines and the Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of ketone intermediates to provide diverse enantiomerically enriched &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols. The excellent yields and enantioselectivities (up to 96&#8201;% yield and up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8201;ee) with a wide substrate scope in this one&#8208;pot strategy were obtained.

Catch as catch can. Fmoc&#8208;SPPS &#945;&#8208;GalNAc&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;GlcNAc&#8208; and &#945;&#8208;GlcNAc&#8208;O&#8208;Tyr amino acid building blocks were prepared and applied in synthesis of glycopeptide vaccine constructs and an extensive Tyr&#8208;modified glycopeptide library. Antibodies were raised and affinity purified against the antigen peptides. Evaluation by ELISA, glycopeptide microarrays and by western blot analysis showed high antibody specificity towards GalNAc&#8208; and GlcNAc&#8208;O&#8208;Tyr modifications without cross reactivity to the corresponding Ser or Thr glycopeptides.







Abstract
In the last decade, it was discovered that protein mucin&#8208;type O&#8208;glycosylation and O&#8208;GlcNAcylation modify Tyr residues besides the well explored Thr and Ser amino acids. Several glycoproteomic studies have identified &#945;&#8208;GalNAc&#8208;O&#8208;Tyr modifications, and studies propose that &#946;&#8208;GlcNAc&#8208;O&#8208;Tyr also exists as a new group of posttranslational modifications (PTMs). Specific bacterial toxins have further been identified to modify host GTPases with &#945;&#8208;GlcNAc&#8208;O&#8208;Tyr to promote bacterial virulence. Despite being identified on numerous proteins, the biological roles, biosynthesis and expression of GalNAc&#8208; and GlcNAc&#8208;O&#8208;Tyr modifications are poorly understood. A major obstacle is the lack of tools to specifically detect and identify proteins containing these modifications. With this in mind, we prepared vaccine constructs and raised antibodies to enable selective detection of proteins carrying these new PTMs. The obtained polyclonal antibody sera were evaluated using ELISA and glycopeptide microarrays and were found to be highly selective for GlcNAc&#8208; and GalNAc&#8208;O&#8208;Tyr glycopeptides over the corresponding Ser&#8208; and Thr&#8208;modifications. For microarray analysis, synthetic GlcNAc&#8208; and GalNAc&#8208;O&#8208;Tyr Fmoc&#8208;amino acids were prepared and applied in Fmoc&#8208;SPPS to obtain an extensive O&#8208;glycopeptide library. After affinity purification, the antibodies were applied in western blot analysis and showed specific detection of &#945;&#8208;GlcNAc&#8208;O&#8208;Tyr modified RhoA GTPase.

         <title>Efficient K&#8208;Storage of Fe&#8208;Coupled Organic Molecule Anode in Ether&#8208;Based Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 29, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal coupling strategy combined with electrolytes regulation are adopted to develop a novel organic K&#8208;storage anode of Fe&#8208;NTCDA with improved specific capacity and long cycle stability in the optimized 3&#8197;M KFSI/DME electrolytes, attributed to the increased K&#8208;storage sites as well as enhanced K+ transfer kinetics.







Abstract
Given these advantages of widely designable structures and environmentally friendly characteristics, organic electrode materials (OEMs) are considered to be promising electrode materials for alkaline metal&#8208;ion batteries. However, their large&#8208;scale application is hampered by insufficient specific capacity and rate performance. Here, Fe2+ is coupled to the anhydride molecule NTCDA to form a novel K&#8208;storage anode Fe&#8208;NTCDA. In this way, the working potential of Fe&#8208;NTCDA anode is reduced, which makes it more suitable to be used as an anode material. Meanwhile, the electrochemical performance is significantly improved due to the increase in K&#8208;storage sites. Moreover, electrolytes regulation is implemented to optimize the K&#8208;storage behavior, resulting into a high specific capacity of 167&#8197;mAh/g after 100 cycles at 50&#8197;mA/g and 114&#8197;mAh/g even at 500&#8197;mA/g in the 3&#8197;M KFSI/DME electrolytes.

         <title>The Role of Anionic Ligands on Photoreactivity in Mo(VI) Dioxo Complexes of the Form MoO2X2(NN)
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 29, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combined experimental and computational study into the light&#8208;initiated C&#8722;H activation reactivity by MoO2X2(bpy) elucidates the critical role of a bpy&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer. With stronger donating anionic ancillary ligands, the first excited state involves a ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer from the anionic ancillary ligand (X), which initiated radical decomposition instead of C&#8722;H activation via the metal oxo motif.







Abstract
The photoreactivity of d0 metal dioxo complexes in activating C&#8722;H bonds has been recently studied.[1&#8211;3] We have previously reported that MoO2Cl2(bpy&#8208;tBu) is an effective platform for light initiated C&#8722;H activation with unique product selectivity for the overall functionalization.[1] Herein we expand on these studies and report the synthesis and photoreactivity of several new Mo(VI) dioxo complexes with the general formula MoO2(X)2(NN); where X=F&#8722;, Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, CH3&#8722;, PhO&#8722;, tBuO&#8722; and NN=2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy) or 4,4&#8242;&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;bipyridine (bpy&#8208;tBu). Among these compounds, MoO2Cl2(bpy&#8208;tBu) and MoO2Br2(bpy&#8208;tBu) are able to participate in bimolecular photoreactivity with several substrates containing C&#8722;H bonds of various types such as allyls, benzyls, aldehydes (RCHO) and alkanes. MoO2(CH3)2bpy and MoO2(PhO)2bpy do not participate in bimolecular photoreactions and instead they undergo photodecompositions. Computational studies indicate that the nature of the HOMO and LUMO is critical in supporting photoreactivity, with access to an LMCT (bpy&#8594;Mo) being necessary for tractable hydrocarbon functionalization.

         <title>A Cyclodextrin Polymer as Supramolecular Matrix for Scalable Green Photooxygenation of Hydrophobic Substrates in Homogeneous Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 29, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic endoperoxides were synthesized as O2 releasing agents in organic solvent upon irradiation of a photocatalyst in the presence of the precursors in mM concentration. Co&#8208;encapsulation of both reactants in a cyclodextrin polymer allowed to successfully perform the photocatalyzed oxygenation in homogeneous aqueous environment. Controlled release of O2 could be achieved upon thermolysis.







Abstract
In the quest for new therapies targeting hypoxia, aromatic endoperoxides have intriguing potential as oxygen releasing agents (ORAs) able to free O2 in tissues upon suitable trigger. Four aromatic substrates were synthesized and the formation of their corresponding endoperoxides was optimized in organic solvent upon selective irradiation of Methylene Blue, a low&#8208;cost photocatalyst, producing the reactive singlet oxygen species. Complexation of the hydrophobic substrates within a hydrophilic cyclodextrin (CyD) polymer allowed their photooxygenation in homogeneous aqueous environment using the same optimized protocol upon dissolution in water of the three readily accessible reagents. Notably, reaction rates were comparable in buffered D2O and organic solvent and, for the first time, the photooxygenation of highly hydrophobic substrates was achieved for millimolar solutions in non&#8208;deuterated water. Quantitative conversion of the substrates, straightforward isolation of the endoperoxides and recovery of the polymeric matrix were achieved. Cycloreversion of one ORA to the original aromatic substrate was observed upon thermolysis. These results hold great potential for the launch of CyD polymers both as reaction vessels for green, homogeneous photocatalysis and as carrier for the delivery of ORAs in tissues.

         <title>Unveiling Photodegradation and Photosensitization Mechanisms of Unconjugated Pterins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 29, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the crucial role of unconjugated pterins in enzymatic processes and the photosensitization of singlet oxygen and other biomolecules, the mechanism underlying the photochemistry of these chromophores is still unclear. With the help of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, we shed light into the very fast triplet&#8208;state population, their photodegradation pathways, and the photosensitization of biomolecules.







Abstract
Unconjugated pterins are ubiquitous molecules that participate in countless enzymatic processes and are potentially involved in the photosensitization of singlet oxygen, amino acids, and nucleotides. Following electronic excitation with UV&#8208;A light, some of these pterins degrade, producing hydrogen peroxide as the main side product. This process, which is known to take place in&#8197;vivo, contributes to oxidative stress and melanocyte destruction in vitiligo. In this work, we present for the first time mechanistic insight into the formation of transient triplet species that simultaneously trigger Type I and Type II photosensitizing processes and the initiation of degradation processes. Our calculations reveal that photodegradation of 6&#8208;biopterin, which accumulates in the skin of vitiligo patients, leads to 6&#8208;formylpterin through a retro&#8208;aldol reaction, and subsequently to 6&#8208;carboxypterin through a water&#8208;mediated aldehyde oxidation. Additionally, we show that the changes in the photosensitizing potential of these systems with pH come from the modulation of their excited&#8208;state redox potentials.

A strategy that empowers activity&#8208;based proteome profiling of &#916;8&#8208;THC, a psychoactive natural product from Cannabis sativa, through a late&#8208;stage arene olefination method is described. This olefination method is capable of converting non&#8208;covalent acting compounds, such as &#916;8&#8208;THC, into activity&#8208;based probes after silyl deprotection. Its ability to interrogate protein interaction landscape of &#916;8&#8208;THC is then compared with AfBPP.







Abstract
Drugs and bioactive natural products exert their pharmacological effects by engaging numerous cellular targets in our body. Identification of these protein targets is essential for understanding the mechanism&#8208;of&#8208;action of these compounds, thus contributing to improved drug design in drug discovery programs. Termed &#8220;in&#8197;situ drug profiling&#8221;, a common strategy for studying these bioactive compounds centralized on the covalent capture of protein targets along with a reporter tag to facilitate downstream proteomic analyses. Though highly successful, such reliance on innate electrophilic traps to facilitate covalent capture restricted its applications to covalent acting compounds. Late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization (LSF) may resolve this by substituting biologically inert C&#8722;H bonds with desired electrophilic groups. Herein, we demonstrated this concept by arming a diverse range of electron&#8208;rich aromatic drugs and natural products with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters, via late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H olefination with an arylthio&#8208;based carboxylic acid ligand developed by Ibanez and co&#8208;workers. We also showed that covalent probes generated from this LSF approach could be applied for &#8220;in&#8197;situ drug profiling&#8221; of &#916;8&#8208;THC, as exemplified by the successful target engagement of &#945;&#8208;4&#8201;db, a &#916;8&#8208;THC&#8208;based probe, to its native target hCB2R. In combination with AfBP 7, a photoaffinity&#8208;based derivative of &#916;8&#8208;THC, we identified several novel putative targets that could account for some of the effects in THC consumption. We anticipate our C&#8722;H LSF strategy to be widely adopted for future studies of non&#8208;covalent drugs.

         <title>Black Titania and Niobia within Ten Minutes &#8211; Mechanochemical Reduction of Metal Oxides with Alkali Metal Hydrides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 29, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid and easy&#8208;to&#8208;perform mechanochemical method for the partial reduction of TiO2 and Nb2O5 to the corresponding black oxides using NaH and LiH as reducing agents was developed. As shown by EPR spectroscopy, unpaired electrons were generated, and the obtained oxides exhibit better photocatalytic activity than the pristine oxides.







Abstract
Partially or fully reduced transition metal oxides show extraordinary electronic and catalytic properties but are usually prepared by high temperature reduction reactions. This study reports the systematic investigation of the fast mechanochemical reduction of rutile&#8208;type TiO2 and H&#8208;Nb2O5 to their partially reduced black counterparts applying NaH and LiH as reducing agents. Milling time and oxide to reducing agent ratio show a large influence on the final amount of reduced metal ions in the materials. For both oxides LiH shows a higher reducing potential than NaH. An intercalation of Li+ into the structure of the oxides was proven by PXRD and subsequent Rietveld refinements as well as 6Li solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. The products showed a decreased band gap and the presence of unpaired electrons as observed by EPR spectroscopy, proving the successful reduction of Ti4+ and Nb5+. Furthermore, the developed material exhibits a significantly enhanced photocatalytic performance towards the degradation of methylene blue compared to the pristine oxides. The presented method is a general, time efficient and simple method to obtain reduced transition metal oxides.

         <dc:description>
The fundamental mechanism driving the high reactivity of mono&#8208;substituted tetrazines is explored through substituent effects in the bioorthogonal Diels&#8211;Alder reactions of 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazines. Through computational analysis, the study unveils how an asynchronous approach of the reaction partner can mitigate adverse interactions during the reaction, leading to a reduction in the reaction barrier height. More information can be found in the Research Article by D. Svatunek and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300345).

Deracemization is like magic. Chiral catalysts and visible light act like a magician and his magic props, leading to deracemization as a magical tool that can convert a racemic compound into one of its enantiomers with 100&#8201;% atomic efficiency. In their Review (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202204029), Z. Jiang and co&#8208;workers provide a comprehensive overview of the advances in this attractive area, with a systematic summary and discussion.

         <title>Front Cover: Unveiling Photodegradation and Photosensitization Mechanisms of Unconjugated Pterins (Chem. Eur. J. 29/2023)</title>

         <dc:description>
Pterins can be considered as biological jacks&#8208;of&#8208;all&#8208;trades. Firstly identified as pigments in butterfly wings, they are nowadays well&#8208;known cofactors in the synthesis of NO, nucleotides, and amino acids, markers in cell&#8208;mediated immune responses. Yet, not all of their properties are beneficial. Some of these pterins contribute to the photochemical evolution of vitiligo, a depigmentation disorder. Enhanced oxidative stress and cytotoxicity lead to melanocyte destruction and tissue damage. More information can be found in the Research Article by E.&#8197;M. Arpa and I. Corral (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300519).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pterins can be considered as biological jacks-of-all-trades&lt;/b&gt;. Firstly identified as pigments in butterfly wings, they are nowadays well-known cofactors in the synthesis of NO, nucleotides, and amino acids, markers in cell-mediated immune responses. Yet, not all of their properties are beneficial. Some of these pterins contribute to the photochemical evolution of vitiligo, a depigmentation disorder. Enhanced oxidative stress and cytotoxicity lead to melanocyte destruction and tissue damage. More information can be found in the Research Article by E.&#8197;M. Arpa and I. Corral (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202300519"&gt;10.1002/chem.202300519&lt;/a&gt;).

Deracemization is like magic. Chiral catalysts and visible light act like a magician and his magic props, leading to deracemization as a magical tool that can convert a racemic compound into one of its enantiomers with 100&#8201;% atomic efficiency. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the advances in this attractive area, with a systematic summary and discussion. For more details, see the Review by Z. Jiang et&#8197;al.

Overcoming limitations: Deracemization represents an attractive strategy for the synthesis of enantioenriched molecules. How to compensate for the decrease in entropy and prevent microreversibility pose two unavoidable challenges. In recent years, visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven asymmetric photocatalysis has been recognized as a promising tool to overcome the limitations, given that a number of deracemization reactions have been established. This review summarizes and discusses these important achievements.







Abstract
Asymmetric catalysis has long been recognized as a powerful tool for the synthesis of enantioenriched molecules. In addition to precise enantiocontrol, high&#8208;atom economy, which is crucial for practicality, has always been pursued by chemists in the development of methodologies. Consequently, deracemization, the direct conversion of a racemic compound to one of its enantiomers, and thus characterized by a 100&#8201;% atom efficiency, has attracted increasing interest. Recently, visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalysis has been demonstrated to be a promising platform for the development of deracemization. Central to its success is its ability to efficiently overcome the prevailing kinetic issues in chemical transformations and the intrinsic thermodynamic challenges, which typically require the use of additional stoichiometric reagents, thus undermining the original advantages. In this review, the advances in this attractive area are systematically summarized and discussed, with examples organized according to the different modalities of energy transfer and single&#8208;electron transfer in photocatalysis.

Metalated (aza)bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes are currently experiencing a renaissance, as evidenced by the numerous reports in the last 5&#8197;years that have relied on such intermediates to facilitate new reactivity or generate novel fragments. This review explores the broad range of chemical transformations that have utilized metalated (aza)bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes as linchpin reagents from their first reported use in synthesis to the present day.







Abstract
The use of metalated (aza)bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes in synthesis is currently experiencing a renaissance, as evidenced by the numerous reports in the last 5&#8197;years that have relied on such intermediates to undergo unique transformations or generate novel fragments. Since their discovery, these species have been demonstrated to participate in a wide range of reactions with carbon and heteroatom electrophiles, as well as metal complexes, to facilitate the rapid diversification of (aza)bicyclo[1.1.0]butane&#8208;containing compounds. Key to this is the relative acidity of the bridgehead C&#8722;H bonds which promotes facile deprotonation and subsequent functionalization of an unsubstituted position on the carbon framework via the intermediacy of a metalated (aza)bicyclo[1.1.0]butane. Additionally, the late&#8208;stage incorporation of deuterium atoms in strained fragments has led to the elucidation of numerous reaction mechanisms that involve strained bicycles. The continued investigation into the inimitable reactivity of metalated bicycles will cement their importance within the field of organometallic chemistry.

         <title>Synthesis and Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship Studies of C(13)&#8208;Desmethylene&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;Zampanolide Analogs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reduced or demethylated variants of a C(13)&#8208;desmethylene congener of the marine microtubule stabilizer (&#8722;)&#8208;zampanolide have been prepared by HWE&#8208;based macrocyclization and stereoselective construction of the hemiaminal center in the side chain. While all modifications led to reduced growth inhibitory activity, the 2,3&#8208;dihydro and the C(17)&#8208;desmethyl variants retained potent antiproliferative activity with single&#8208;digit to low&#8208;double&#8208;digit nanomolar IC50 values against several cancer cell lines.







Abstract
We describe the synthesis and biochemical and cellular profiling of five partially reduced or demethylated analogs of the marine macrolide (&#8722;)&#8208;zampanolide (ZMP). These analogs were derived from 13&#8208;desmethylene&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;zampanolide (DM&#8208;ZMP), which is an equally potent cancer cell growth inhibitor as ZMP. Key steps in the synthesis of all compounds were the formation of the dioxabicyclo[15.3.1]heneicosane core by an intramolecular HWE reaction (67&#8211;95&#8201;% yield) and a stereoselective aza&#8208;aldol reaction with an (S)&#8208;BINOL&#8208;derived sorbamide transfer complex, to establish the C(20) stereocenter (24&#8211;71&#8201;% yield). As the sole exception, for the 5&#8208;desmethyl macrocycle, ring&#8208;closure relied on macrolactonization; however, elaboration of the macrocyclization product into the corresponding zampanolide analog was unsuccessful. All modifications led to reduced cellular activity and lowered microtubule&#8208;binding affinity compared to DM&#8208;ZMP, albeit to a different extent. For compounds incorporating the reactive enone moiety of ZMP, IC50 values for cancer cell growth inhibition varied between 5 and 133&#8197;nM, compared to 1&#8211;12&#8197;nM for DM&#8208;ZMP. Reduction of the enone double bond led to a several hundred&#8208;fold loss in growth inhibition. The cellular potency of 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;13&#8208;desmethylene zampanolide, as the most potent analog identified, remained within a ninefold range of that of DM&#8208;ZMP.

         <title>Modulating Energy Transfer and Light&#8208;Emitting Colors by Chiral Dye Exchange and Achiral&#8208;to&#8208;Chiral Dye Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pure exo&#8208; and endo&#8208;dye stereoisomers, and blue&#8208;light&#8208;emitting single crystal of an exo&#8208;isomer were prepared. 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy reveals the spatial configurations of endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;dye stereoisomers. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals precise exo&#8208;configuration and dynamic nature of Diels&#8211;Alder covalent bonds. A chiral dye solid displayed circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence due to the chiral transfer from non&#8208;chromophore alky chirality to pyrene chromophore.







Abstract
New chiral and achiral dyes were synthesized by using clean, highly efficient Diels&#8211;Alder &#8216;click&#8217; reactions. We prepared pure endo&#8208; and exo&#8208; stereoisomers and blue&#8208;light&#8208;emitting single crystal of an exo&#8208;isomer. 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveal the precise spatial configurations of endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;dye stereoisomers. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction results reveal the dynamic nature of Diels&#8211;Alder covalent bonds. By reversible formation and cleavage of dynamic covalent bonds, an achiral dye was converted to a chiral dye, where achiral dansyl dye moiety was replaced by chiral moiety. Before achiral&#8208;to&#8208;chiral dye conversion, the dye system displayed dansyl acceptor green light&#8208;emitting color due to intramolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer, where the blue emission of pyrene donor fluorophore was not observed. After achiral&#8208;to&#8208;chiral dye conversion, light&#8208;emitting colors of dye system change from green to blue, where the pyrene&#8208;to&#8208;dansyl fluorophore energy transfer was suppressed, and pyrene fluorophore blue emission was restored. Chiral transfer occurs in a chiral dye solid from non&#8208;chromophore alky chirality to pyrene chromophore. Thus, the chiral dye solid displayed chiral optical behaviors, i.&#8201;e., circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence.

         <title>Potent and Selective Cell&#8208;Active Iminosugar Inhibitors of Human &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;Acetylgalactosaminidase (&#945;&#8208;NAGAL)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycoside hydrolases (GHs) are a class of enzymes with emerging roles in various diseases. Selective GH inhibitors are sought to better understand their functions and assess the therapeutic potential of modulating their activities. Iminosugars are a promising class of GH inhibitors but typically lack the selectivity required to accurately perturb biological systems. Here, we describe a concise synthesis of iminosugar inhibitors of N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;galactosaminidase (&#945;&#8208;NAGAL), the GH responsible for cleaving terminal &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine residues from glycoproteins and glycoconjugates. Starting from non&#8208;carbohydrate precursors, this modular synthesis supported the identification of a potent (490 nM) and &#945;&#8208;NAGAL selective (~200&#8208;fold) guanidino&#8208;containing derivative DGJNGuan.&#160; To illustrate the cellular activity of this new inhibitor, we developed a quantitative fluorescence image&#8208;based method to measure levels of the Tn&#8208;antigen, a cellular glycoprotein substrate of a&#8208;NAGAL. Using this assay we show that DGJGuan exhibits excellent inhibition of a&#8208;NAGAL within cells using patient derived fibroblasts (EC50 = 150 nM). Moreover, in vitro and in cell assays to assess levels of lysosomal b&#8208;hexosaminidase substrate ganglioside GM2 show that DGJGuan is selective whereas DGJNAc exhibits off&#8208;target inhibition both in vitro and within cells. DGJNGuan is a readily produced and selective tool compound that should prove useful for investigating the physiological roles of &#945;&#8208;NAGAL.</dc:description>

         <title>RNA&#8208;catalyzed RNA Ligation within Prebiotically Plausible Model Protocells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Demonstrating RNA catalysis within prebiotically relevant models of primordial cells (protocells) remains a challenge in Origins of life research. Fatty acid vesicles encapsulating genomic and catalytic RNAs (ribozymes) are attractive models for protocells; however, RNA catalysis has largely been incompatible with fatty acid vesicles due to their instability in the presence of Mg2+ at concentrations required for ribozyme function. Here, we report a ribozyme that catalyzes template&#8208;directed RNA ligation at low Mg2+ concentrations and thus remains active within stable vesicles. Ribose and adenine, both prebiotically relevant molecules, were found to greatly reduce Mg2+&#8208;induced RNA leakage from vesicles. When we co&#8208;encapsulated the ribozyme, substrate, and template within fatty acid vesicles, we observed efficient RNA&#8208;catalyzed RNA ligation upon subsequent addition of Mg2+. Our work shows that RNA&#8208;catalyzed RNA assembly can occur efficiently within prebiotically plausible fatty acid vesicles and represents a step toward the replication of primordial genomes within self&#8208;replicating protocells.</dc:description>

         <title>First Example of 1,2,5&#8208;Oxadiazole&#8208;Based Hypergolic Ionic Liquids: a New Class of Potential Energetic Fuels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of liquid energetic fuels with improved properties is important topic in space propulsion technologies. In this manuscript, a series of energetic ionic liquids incorporating a 1,2,5&#8208;oxadiazole ring and nitrate, dicyanamide or dinitramide anion was synthesized and their physicochemical properties were evaluated. The synthesized compounds were fully characterized and were found to have good thermal stabilities (up to 219 &#176;C) and experimental densities (1.21&#8208;1.47 g cm&#8208;3). Advantageously, 1,2,5&#8208;oxadiazole&#8208;based ionic liquids have high combined nitrogen&#8208;oxygen contents (up to 64.4%), while their detonation velocities are on the level of known explosive TNT, and combustion performance exceeds those of benchmark 2&#8208;hydroxyethylhydrazinium nitrate. Considering the established hypergolicity with H2O2 in the presence of a catalyst, and insensitivity to impact, synthesized ionic liquids have strong application potential as energetic fuels for space technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of polymeric ligand grafting region on confined assembly of gold nanorods in cylindrical nanopores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The grafting region of polymeric ligands exhibit a significant influence on the assembly behavior of polymer tethered gold nanorods (AuNRs) in confined space. In this work, the effect of core size, molecular weight and grafting region of ligands on the assembly structure in cylindrical nanopores was investigated. It is found that polystyrene end&#8208;tethered AuNR (AuNR@End&#8208;PS) exhibits a dumbbell&#8208;like shape, while the AuNR with PS tethered on entire surface (AuNR@Full&#8208;PS) shows a rod&#8208;like morphology that gradually transforms into a spherical shape as the molecular weight increases. AuNR@End&#8208;PS is affected by the special steric hindrance at both ends, and prefers to form special structures such as inclination arrangement, whereas AuNR@Full&#8208;PS prefer to be arranged shoulder&#8208;to&#8208;shoulder in a chain&#8208;like assembly. The confinement effect was studied as well by varying the diameter of pores. The results show that the nanoparticles prefer to arrange into a regular and ordered assembly structure in the strong confinement spaces. Under the synergy of confined spaces and ligands at both ends, the AuNRs@End&#8208;PS are more likely to form a tilted order&#8208;assembly structure. The results of this work could provide new ideas and guidance for the preparation of ordered assembly of AuNRs with novel structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterophenoquinones: Tuning Optoelectronics and Electrochromicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochromism: A modular access to 16 intensely colored, redox&#8208;active heterophenoquinones is presented. Structure to property relationships are identified. This material class is promising as cathodically decoloring electrochromes with well&#8208;defined structures and redox states.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and optoelectronic properties of 16 thiophene&#8208;based heterophenoquinones. These compounds were accessed in a convergent and modular approach, allowing for their efficient synthesis. Tuning of the optical band gap was achieved through &#960;&#8208;extension by annulation of a benzene or tropone moiety to the thiophene, oxidation, change of the heteroatom or by attachment of a donor substituent to the thiophene core. The resulting compounds display intense colors covering the entire visible spectrum. We identified structure&#8208;property relationships and their impact on the HOMO and LUMO levels. Additionally, these materials change color upon reduction and according to in&#8197;situ ultraviolet&#8208;visible&#8208;near infrared (UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectro&#8208;electrochemistry, they are promising electrochromes with cathodic color changes. Seven different electrochromic devices were constructed which all displayed a change in color upon reduction, demonstrating the potential of these new dyes in for example tintable glass.

         <title>Molecular Assembly and Gelating Behavior of (l)&#8208;Alanine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight organogelator derived from (L)&#8208;amino acids was designed and synthesized. The (L)&#8208;alanine derivatives were determined to be excellent gelators, forming good gels even when smaller amounts were added. Self&#8208;molecular aggregates were observed to be helical or sheet&#8208;like, and the gels were constructed by forming aggregates by self&#8208;molecular recognition.







Abstract
In this study, a low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight organogelator derived from (l)&#8208;amino acids was designed and synthesized. Gelation assays using (l)&#8208;amino acid derivatives were performed to confirm the gelation ability, which was found to be high in several compounds. The (l)&#8208;alanine derivatives were determined to be excellent gelators, forming good gels even when smaller amounts were added. These results led to a library of amino acid&#8208;derived organogelators. In addition, the thermal properties of the (l)&#8208;alanine derivatives with high gelation performance were measured. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements revealed that the thermal stability of the gels could be controlled by changing the gelator concentration. The surface states of the obtained gels were observed by field&#8208;emission scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy measurements, which confirmed the structure of the self&#8208;molecular aggregates. Self&#8208;molecular aggregates were observed to be helical or sheet&#8208;like, and the gels were constructed by forming aggregates by self&#8208;molecular recognition.

         <title>De&#8208;Risking S&#8208;F Bond Formation: A Gas Cylinder&#8208;Free Strategy to Access S(IV) and S(VI) Fluorinated Compounds
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we report the oxidative halogenation of thiols via the ex situ generation of chlorine by employing calcium hypochorite as solid bench&#8208;stable precursor. This approach enables the synthesis of three distinct classes of compounds (R&#8208;SF3, RSO2F and RSF4Cl). Metastable R&#8208;SF4Cl intermediates are further postfunctionalized to access structures of higher complexity, and computational analysis elucidate potential pathways that leads to cis&#8208;selectivity for certain heteroaromatic SF4Cl structures.







Abstract
The sulfur&#8208;fluorine partnership occupies a privileged position in fluorine chemistry given the functional versatility that it imparts to organic structures. Despite this, available methodologies to forge S&#8722;F bonds are limited compared to C&#8722;F bond formation. Here, we describe a synthetic protocol that selectively enables the oxidative halogenation of aliphatic, aromatic, and heteroaromatic thiols to their corresponding SF4Cl, SO2F and SF3 derivatives. Selective oxidation of thiols to either S(IV)&#8208;F or S(VI)&#8208;F compounds is achieved by employing bench&#8208;stable calcium hypochlorite as chlorine surrogate (CLOgen), in the presence of KF as fluoride source. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided insight into the mechanistic aspects of the transformation and rationalized the observed isomeric preference towards the SF4Cl derivatives. Ultimately, this glovebox&#8208;free method selectively dispatches three classes of compounds upon reaction condition fine&#8208;tuning. Furthermore, first&#8208;in&#8208;class transformations are reported, including the preparation of aliphatic SF4Cl intermediates, their transformation into aliphatic sulfur pentafluoride analogs, and post&#8208;functionalizations that allow accessing highly complex SF4&#8208;bridged scaffolds.

Here, we describe a synthetic protocol that selectively enables the oxidative halogenation of aliphatic, aromatic, and heteroaromatic thiols to their corresponding SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl, SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F and SF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; derivatives. Selective oxidation of thiols to either S(IV)-F or S(VI)-F compounds is achieved by employing bench-stable calcium hypochlorite as chlorine surrogate (CLOgen), in the presence of KF as fluoride source. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided insight into the mechanistic aspects of the transformation and rationalized the observed isomeric preference towards the SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl derivatives. Ultimately, this glovebox-free method selectively dispatches three classes of compounds upon reaction condition fine-tuning. Furthermore, first-in-class transformations are reported, including the preparation of aliphatic SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl intermediates, their transformation into aliphatic sulfur pentafluoride analogs, and post-functionalizations that allow accessing highly complex SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-bridged scaffolds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Near&#8208;Room&#8208;Temperature Synergetic Response of Magnetism, Dielectricity and Luminescence Based on (C5NH13Cl)2MnBr4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid phase transition (OIHPT) material, (C5NH13Cl)2MnBr4 shows magnetic, dielectric and luminescence synergetic response at near room temperature.







Abstract
Multifunctional materials with working temperatures near room temperature are crucial for practical applications. Until now, it is still a great challenge to obtain such materials. In this paper, a complex of (C5NH13Cl)2MnBr4 (1) with a structural phase transition near room temperature is reported. The phase transition induces switchable magnetic properties, dielectric anomalies and luminescent response over the same range of temperatures. It is the first time the synergetic effect of magnetism, dielectricity and luminescence near room temperature have been observed in the same molecular complex.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indigo dye is one of the most iconic compounds connecting chemistry to our society. In addition to providing the characteristic blue color, indigos display fascinating photochemical properties. This Review first discusses the synthetic construction and derivatization of indigos. Then their photoswitching and photoinduced electron transfer behaviors are described to showcase the utility of indigos as photoresponsive molecular tools.







Abstract
Indigo, one of the most ancient and abundant dyes in human history, has recently emerged as a potential functional motif due to its intriguing photochemical properties. This review aims to provide insights into both the preparation of these molecules and their utilization in molecular systems. First, the synthesis of the indigo core as well as available methods to derivatize indigo are described to outline synthetic strategies to build the desired molecular structures. Then, the photochemical behavior of indigos is discussed, with particular focus on E&#8208;Z photoisomerization and photoinduced electron transfer. Connections between the molecular structures and their photochemical properties are highlighted and serve as guiding principles for designing indigos to be applied as photoresponsive tools.

         <title>Engineering Oxygen Vacancies on VO2 Multilayered Structures for Efficient Zn2+ Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen vacancies can provide extra active sites for Zn2+ storage and reduce electrostatic barrier for Zn2+ transportation, but excessive vacancies would lead to a reverse effect. The oxygen vacancy contents in VO2 can be regulated and Od&#8208;VO2 cathode with optimum vacancy concentration achieves a good performance with high capacity, long cycle stability and high energy density.







Abstract
Vanadium dioxide (VO2(B)) is a proper cathode for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) due to its shear structure and high theoretical capacity. However, the sluggish kinetics and structure instability derived from the strong electrostatic interaction between Zn2+ and the VO2 host hinder its further application. Defect engineering is a useful way to circumvent the limitations. Herein, oxygen&#8208;defect VO2 (Od&#8208;VO2) with tunable oxygen vacancy concentration are obtained via a facile one&#8208;step hydrothermal method by adjusting ascorbic acid addition. It is proved that oxygen vacancies can provide extra active sites for Zn2+ storage and reduced electrostatic barrier for Zn2+ transportation, but excessive vacancy content would lead to a reverse effect. The Od&#8208;VO2 cathode with optimum oxygen vacancy concentration achieves an outstanding performance with a high capacity of 380 mAhg&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;A g&#8722;1, excellent cycle stability with 92.6&#8201;% capacity retention after 2000&#8197;cycles at 3&#8197;A g&#8722;1 and a high energy density of 197&#8197;Wh kg&#8722;1 at the power density of 0.641&#8197;kW kg&#8722;1. Therefore, this defect engineering method for Od&#8208;VO2 provides an attractive way for high&#8208;performance aqueous ZIB cathodes.

         <title>Electrospray Ionization Tandem Mass Spectrometry With Collision Induced Dissociation of Uranyl Peroxide Nanoclusters Containing Various Uranyl Bridging Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Actinide gas phase chemistry: When uranyl peroxide nanoclusters (UPCs) are subjected to electrospray ionization (ESI) tandem mass spectrometry with collision&#8208;induced dissociation, the resulting fragment ion products reflect UPCs solid&#8208;state chemistry. Although the peroxo groups exact chemistry is not preserved, the presence of superoxo groups is observed, which suggests that electrochemical reactions of peroxo groups are taking place at the capillary tip of the ESI.







Abstract
Electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry with collision&#8208;induced dissociation (ESI&#8208;MS/MS) was utilized to study the gas phase fragmentation of uranyl peroxide nanoclusters with hydroxo, peroxo, oxalate, and pyrophosphate bridging ligands. These nanoclusters fragment into uranium monomers and dimers with mass&#8208;to&#8208;charge (m/z) ratios in the 280&#8211;380 region. The gas phase fragmentation of each cluster studied yields a distinct UO6&#8722; anion attributed to the cleavage of a uranyl ion bound to 2 peroxide groups, along with other anions that can be attributed to the initial composition of the nanoclusters.

         <title>Indolocarbazole&#8208;Based Multiple&#8208;Resonance Molecules: an Emerging Class of Full&#8208;Color, Narrowband Emitters for Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The indolocarbazole&#8208;based emitters have recently emerged as a class of acceptor&#8208;free multiple resonance emitters, exhibiting extremely small FWHMs, good color&#8208;tunability from violet to deep red and excellent stability in OLED devices, which are ideal as end emitters in sensitizer&#8208;type OLEDs.







Abstract
Narrowband emitters based on the multiple resonance (MR) effect have shown great promises for applications in high&#8208;definition displays. Though most reported MR emitters adopt the boron&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;doped triangulene&#8208;like skeleton following the design of the DABNA series, MR materials with the nitrogen&#8208;only indolocarbazole structures have recently emerged and demonstrated good color tunability from violet to deep red and impressive electroluminescence performances in terms of both efficiency and stability. Herein, we will summarize indolocarbazole&#8208;based MR materials in recent reports, with emphasis on their molecular design, synthesis, photophysical and electroluminescence properties as well as some future research directions to unlock the full potential of this fascinating class of materials.

         <title>The Best of Both Worlds: Combining the Power of MICs and WCAs to generate Stable and Crystalline CrI&#8208;tetracarbonyl Complexes with [[EQUATION]] Accepting Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we present stable and crystalline chromium(I) tetracarbonyl complexes with pyridyl&#8208;MIC (MIC = mesoionic carbene) ligands and weakly coordinating anions (WCA = [Al(ORF)4]&#8722;, RF = C(CF3)3 and BArF = [B(ArF)4]&#8211;, ArF = 3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3). The complexes were fully characterized via crystallographic, spectroscopic and theoretical methods. The influence of counter anions on the IR and EPR spectroscopic properties of the CrI complexes was investigated, and the electronic innocence vs. non&#8208;innocence of WCAs was probed. These are the first examples of stable and crystalline [Cr(CO)4]+ complexes with a chelating [[EQUATION]] accepting ligand, and the data presented here are of relevance for both the photochemical and the electrochemical properties of these classes of compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>From Terminal to Spiro&#8208;Phosphonium Acceptors, Remarkable Moieties to Develop Polyaromatic NIR Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphonium&#8208;based compounds gain attention as a promising photofunctional materials. As a contribution to the emerging field, we present a series of donor&#8208;acceptor ionic dyes, which were constructed by tailoring the phosphonium (A) and extended &#960;&#8208;NR2 (D) fragments to the anthracene framework. The alteration of the &#960;&#8208;spacer of electron&#8208;donating substituents in species with terminal &#8211;+PPh2Me groups exhibits a long absorption wavelength up to &#955;abs = 527 nm in dichloromethane and shifted the emission to the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region (&#955; = 805 nm for thienyl aniline donor), although at low quantum yield (&#934; &lt; 0.01). In turn, the introduction of a P&#8208;heterocyclic acceptor substantially narrowed the optical bandgap and improved the efficiency of fluorescence. In particular, the phospha&#8208;spiro moiety allowed to attain NIR emission (797 nm in dichloromethane) with fluorescence efficiency of as high as &#934; = 0.12. The electron&#8208;accepting property of phospha&#8208;spiro constituent outperformed that of the monocyclic and terminal phosphonium counterparts, illustrating a promising direction in the design of novel charge transfer chromophores.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Structural Characterization, and Bonding of Molecular Heavier Beryllium Chalcogenides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactions of a cyclic (alkyl)amino carbene (CAAC)&#8208;stabilized beryllium radical with E2Ph2 (E = S, Se, Te) and of a beryllole with HEPh (E = S, Se) yield the corresponding beryllium phenylchalcogenides, including the first structurally authenticated beryllium selenide and telluride complexes. Calculations show that their Be&#8210;E bonds are best described by the interaction between the Be+ and E&#8211; fragments, with Coulombic forces accounting for ca. 55% of the attraction and orbital interactions dominated by the &#963; component.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulphur Dioxide Oxidation by Zinc and Zinc Oxide Nitrate/Nitrite Complexes in the Gas Phase:&#160;An Interplay between Redox&#8208;Active Ligands and Metal.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Different oxidative pathways of sulphur dioxide promoted by ZnO(NO3)2&#8208;, Zn(NO3)2&#8208;&#160;and Zn(NO2)(NO3)&#8208;&#160;are revealed by a joint investigation of mass spectrometry and theoretical calculations. The reactions are triggered by the [Zn+2&#8208;O&#8208;&#8226;]+ or by the low&#8208;valence Zn+&#160;via oxygen ion transfer or electron transfer to SO2, respectively. The NOx&#8208;&#160;ligands intervene in the oxidation only when sulphur dioxide is converted to SO3&#8208;&#160;or SO2&#8208;, leading to the formation of zinc sulphate and zinc sulphite coordinated to nitrate or nitrite anions. Kinetic analyses show that the reactions are fast and efficient, and theory discloses the elementary steps, namely oxygen ion transfer, oxygen atom transfer and electron transfer, occurring through similar energy landscapes for the three reactive anions.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorenylidene&#8208;Cyclopentadithiophene&#8208;Based Asymmetric Bistricyclic Aromatic Ene Compounds: Synthesis and Substituents Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low band gap materials have always been a focus of attention due to their potential applications in various fields. In this work, a series of asymmetric bistricyclic aromatic ene (BAE) compounds with fluorenylidene&#8208;cyclopentadithiophene (FYT) skeleton were facially synthesized, which were modified with different substituents (&#8208;OMe, &#8208;SMe). The FYT core exhibit twisted C=C bond with dihedral angels around 30&#176;, and the introduction of &#8208;SMe group can provide additional S&#183;&#183;&#183;S interaction between molecules, which is conducive to the charge transporting. The UV&#8208;Vis spectra, electrochemistry and photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that these compounds have relatively narrow band gaps, particularly, the &#8208;SMe modified compounds have slightly lower HOMO and Fermi energy levels than that of the &#8208;OMe modified compounds. Furthermore, PSCs devices were fabricated with the three compounds as HTMs, and FYT&#8208;DSDPA exhibit the best performance among them, revealing the fine&#8208;tuning band structure could influence properties of HTMs.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Conversion of Supramolecular Assembly in Solution via Thermally Induced Intramolecular Electron Transfer of [Co2Fe2] Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Combining metal complexes with amphiphilic molecules leads to the construction of a wide variety of functional self&#8208;assembled nanostructures. Metal complexes exhibiting spin transitions can be good candidates as the trigger to cause structural conversion of such assembly because they respond to various external stimuli. In this work, we studied a structural conversion of supramolecular assembly composed of a [Co2Fe2] complex via a thermally induced electron transfer&#8208;coupled spin transition (ETCST). The [Co2Fe2] complex with an amphiphilic anion formed reverse vesicles in solution and showed the thermal ETCST. On the other hand, the thermal ETCST in the presence of a bridging hydrogen&#8208;bond donor (HBD) caused structural conversion from the reverse vesicle structure to entangled onedimensional (1D) chains through hydrogen&#8208;bond (HB) formations.</dc:description>

         <title>Xanthene Separated 24 &#960;&#8208;Electron Antiaromatic Rosarin Dimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antiaromatic molecules have recently received attention because of their intrinsic properties, such as high reactivity and their narrow HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps. Stacking of antiaromatic molecules has been predicted to induce three&#8208;dimensional aromaticity via frontier orbital interactions. Here, we report a covalently linked &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacked rosarin dimer that has been examined experimentally by steady&#8208;state absorption and transient absorption measurements and theoretically by quantum chemical calculations, including TD&#8208;DFT, ACID, and NICS. Relative to the corresponding monomer, the dimer exhibits diminished antiaromaticity upon lowering the temperature to 77K, a finding ascribed to intramolecular interactions between the macrocyclic rosarin subunits.</dc:description>

Here, we report a covalently linked &#960;-&#960; stacked rosarin dimer that has been examined experimentally by steady-state absorption and transient absorption measurements and theoretically by quantum chemical calculations, including TD-DFT, ACID, and NICS. Relative to the corresponding monomer, the dimer exhibits diminished antiaromaticity upon lowering the temperature to 77K, a finding ascribed to intramolecular interactions between the macrocyclic rosarin subunits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>On the Stereochemistry of the NH Bond Activation of Ammonia or Amines by Disilenes: Predictability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bond activation reactions (OH, NH) of stereoisomeric disilenes are often 100&#8201;% stereospecific. Although we have a good understanding of the possible reaction pathways to the isomeric products, without a deeper understanding of the influence of the geometry of the disilene and the influence of the substituents on each elementary step, it remains difficult to predict the stereochemistry of the products.







Abstract
The stereochemistry of the addition of NH3 to the stereoisomers of 1,2&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylphenyl)disilene (Z&#8208;5 or E&#8208;5) is 100&#8201;% stereospecific giving two isomeric disilylamines 6 and 7, respectively, derived from syn&#8208;addition to the stereoisomeric disilenes. Variable time normalization analysis studies of the reaction of tetramesityldisilene (3) with isopropylamine (iPrNH2) revealed that the order in both amine and disilene is 1. The kinetic isotope effect for the addition of iPrNH2/iPrND2 to tetramesityldisilene was determined to be 3.04&#177;0.06 at 298&#8197;K, a primary KIE, indicating that the proton is transferred in the rate determining step. Competition studies between the addition of PrNH2 and iPrNH2 to tetramesityldisilene resulted in the exclusive formation of the PrNH2 adduct consistent with a nucleophilic addition. Computational studies of the mechanism of the addition of ammonia to E&#8208;5 revealed the lowest energy pathway involves the formation of the donor adduct derived from syn&#8208;addition, followed by intramolecular syn&#8208;transfer of the proton. The formation of the donor adduct is the rate determining step. The results of this study, together with previous studies on the addition of ammonia and amines to disilenes, allow for a refinement of our understanding of the mechanism of this important fundamental reaction in disilene chemistry, and allow us to understand our ability to reliably predict the stereochemical outcomes of future NH &#963;&#8208;bond activation reactions.

         <title>The Uncertain Role of Nominations for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry&#8224;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Nobel Prize Nomination Archives provides the names of the nominators and their nominees for the chemistry prize from 1901 to 1970. This data gives insights into the selection of the Nobel Laureates. One of the more unusual observations is an up&#8208;down&#8208;up nomination trend for many of the chemistry laureates at the very end of their nomination profiles. Some chemistry laureates received very few nominations; and some non&#8208;laureates received many nominations. The nomination patterns are often curious and always informative.







Abstract
The solicitation of nominations for the Nobel Prizes in Chemistry (NPch) is and has been the first step in the selection process since the very first awards were made in 1901. The number of nominations solicited by and provided to the Nobel Committee for Chemistry supports the belief by the nominators that their nominations are meaningful. In this publication, we examine data culled from the Nobel Prize Nomination Archives for the period 1901&#8211;1970 of the variable role of nominations in the selection process for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The evidence is overwhelming that nominations, in general, during the 1901&#8211;1970 period have not been the deciding, overriding factor in the selection of the recipients of the NPch. Rather, we posit that nominations from the preselected nominator&#8208;pool have been a source of information for the Committee, used to suggest future years&#8217; contenders and possibly served as motivation for the Committee to seek nominations for specific nominees for future years. It is also clear that selections are often influenced by personal prejudices, for example, friendships, rivalries, and nationality.

         <title>N&#8208;Protonation as a Switch of the Twisted Excited States with &#960;&#960;* or n&#960;* Character and Correlation with the &#960;&#8208;Electrons Characteristic of Rotatable Bonds</title>

         <dc:description>
Two mechanisms are uncovered that control fluorescence through N&#8208;protonation in nitrogen&#8208;containing fluorescent probes. The first mechanism regulates the transition to a &#960;&#960;* TICT state, while the second applies when a nonradiative decay pathway dominates, involving a dark n&#960;* state that is also accompanied by structural twisting and can be considered a type of TICT state.







Abstract
N&#8208;protonation for numerous fluorophores is widely known as an efficient switch for the fluorescence turn&#8208;on/off in acidic conditions, which has been applied in various scenarios that involve pH monitoring. Yet the universal mechanism for fluorescence regulation through N&#8208;protonation is still elusive. Herein, the excited state deactivation processes are systematically investigated for a series of nitrogen&#8208;containing fluorescent probes through theoretical approaches. Two types of mechanisms for the complex fluorescent phenomena by N&#8208;protonation are concluded: one is through the regulation for the transition to a &#960;&#960;* twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) state; the other one applies for the case when nonradiative decay pathway is predominant by a dark n&#960;* state, which is also accompanied by an evident structural twisting and can be regarded as another kind of TICT state. More generally, the formation of the TICT state is closely related to the conjugated &#960;&#8208;electrons on the single bond that links the acceptor and donor part of fluorophores, which provides a simple strategy for evaluating the occurrence of the TICT process. The current contributions can bring novel insights for the rational design of functional fluorophores that involve TICT process in the excited states.

         <title>Superoxide Dismutase&#8208;like Activity of Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework Nanoparticles Comprising Biomimetic Imidazolato&#8208;bridged CuZn Units</title>

Nanosized mixed&#8208;metal zeolitic imidazolate frameworks possess superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. The CuZn&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticle closely mimics the active site of CuZn&#8208;SOD and exhibits exceptional SOD&#8208;like activity and recyclability due to its numerous copper active sites. These porous nanoparticles hold promise for future applications.







Abstract
Nanoparticles exhibiting enzymatic functions have garnered considerable attention due to their structural robustness and the profusion of active sites that can be introduced to a single nanosized particle. Here we report that nanosized mixed&#8208;metal zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) show a superoxide dismutase (SOD)&#8208;like catalytic activity. We chose a ZIF composed of copper and zinc ions and 2&#8208;methylimidazole, CuZn&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8, in which the Cu and Zn ions are bridged by an imidazolato ligand. This coordination geometry closely mimics the active site of CuZn superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD). The CuZn&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticles exhibit potent SOD&#8208;like activity, attributed to their porous nature and numerous copper active sites, and also possess exceptional recyclability.

Using an integrated in&#8197;vitro/in silico experimental workflow; we discovered novel allosteric inhibitors of caspase&#8208;7 and revealed new connections between the active site and the remote allosteric site (i.&#8201;e., allosteric structure&#8211;activity relationships, ASARs) for this valuable disease target.







Abstract
Caspase&#8208;7 (C7), a cysteine protease involved in apoptosis, is a valuable drug target for its role in human diseases (e.&#8201;g., Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, sepsis). The C7 allosteric site has great potential for small&#8208;molecule targeting, but numerous drug discovery efforts have identified precious few allosteric inhibitors. Here we present the first selective, drug&#8208;like inhibitor of C7 along with several other improved inhibitors based on our previous fragment hit. We also provide a rational basis for the impact of allosteric binding on the C7 catalytic cycle by using an integrated approach including X&#8208;ray crystallography, stopped&#8208;flow kinetics, and molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings suggest allosteric binding disrupts C7 pre&#8208;acylation by neutralization of the catalytic dyad, displacement of substrate from the oxyanion hole, and altered dynamics of substrate binding loops. This work advances drug targeting efforts and bolsters our understanding of allosteric structure&#8211;activity relationships (ASARs).

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Flow Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Coupling in Water and Organic Solvents Promoted by Blends of Stabilized Convoluted Polymeric Palladium Catalysts and Polymeric Auxiliary Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and stable catalytic system, which was developed by blending a functional copolymer self&#8208;assembled palladium catalyst with polymeric auxiliary material, allows the continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of various biphenyls in organic solvents or water as the sole solvent.







Abstract
Given that heterogeneous palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C bond formation reactions under continuous&#8208;flow conditions are well suited for the efficient and safe production of pharmaceuticals and functional materials, the development of active and durable catalysts for this purpose is a matter of high practical significance. Here, a previously established molecular convolution methodology was used to synthesize catalysts for Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling under flow conditions by blending convoluted polymeric palladium catalysts (prepared from copolymers of 4&#8208;vinylpyridine and 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylstyrene) and crosslinked polymeric auxiliary materials (prepared from copolymers of divinylbenzene and 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylstyrene). The optimal catalyst exhibited high performance and durability and allowed numerous biaryl products such as liquid&#8208;crystalline materials, organic electroluminescent materials, and pharmaceuticals to be continuously synthesized with turnover frequencies of up to 238&#8197;h&#8722;1. In a demonstration of practical utility, the developed catalytic system was used for the continuous synthesis of two pharmaceuticals (felbinac and fenbufen) in water as the sole solvent.

         <title>Polymeric Unimolecular CO Dehydrogenase Mimic with both Inner and Outer Spheres for Enhanced Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymeric unimolecular nanozyme Co&#8208;1 with three&#8208;level coordination spheres as a mimic of CODH is reported herein. Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photocatalytic CO2 reduction in aqueous solution was achieved with a TONCO of 1731.2, which is comparable to most of molecular catalysts in water. Mechanism study discloses that this structurally well&#8208;defined CODH mimic can stabilize the CO2 adduct intermediate and capture CO2 to improve catalytic activity and selectivity in the similar way as CODH.







Abstract
Inspired by carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH), mimicking its inner and outer spheres is a promising strategy in CO2 reduction catalyst design. However, artificial CODH&#8208;like catalysts are generally limited to the inner sphere effect and only applicable in organic solvents or for electrocatalysis. Herein, an aqueous CODH mimic with both inner and outer spheres for photocatalysis is reported. In this polymeric unimolecular catalyst, the inner sphere is composed of cobalt porphyrin with four appended amido groups and the outer sphere consists of four poly(2&#8208;(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA) arms. Upon visible light irradiation (&#955; &gt;420&#8197;nm), the as&#8208;prepared catalyst exhibits a turnover number (TONCO) of 1731.2 in the reduction of CO2 into CO, which is comparable to most reported molecular catalysts in aqueous solution. The mechanism studies indicate that, in this water&#8208;dispersible and structurally well&#8208;defined CODH mimic, the cobalt porphyrin core serves as the catalysis center and the amido groups function as hydrogen&#8208;bonding pillars helping to stabilize the CO2 adduct intermediate, whereas the PDMAEMA shell renders both water solubility and a CO2 reservoir through reversibly capturing of CO2. The present work has clarified the significance of coordination sphere effects for improving the aqueous photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance of CODH mimics.

The first mixed&#8208;ligand self&#8208;assembly reactions of the organometallic diantimony complex [(Cp)2Mo2(CO)4(&#956;,&#951;2&#8208;Sb2)] (C) with Ag[TEF] ([TEF]=[Al{OC(CF3)3}4]) in the presence of various N&#8208;donor molecules are presented.

         <title>Toughening Hydrogels by Forming Robust Hydrazide&#8208;Transition Metal Coordination Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tough hydrogels were developed by forming robust hydrazide&#8208;Zn2+ coordination complexes. The mechanical properties of the resultant gels exhibited a notable temperature dependence and thus a good shape&#8208;memory ability due to the dynamic nature of coordination bonds. The reactive amine group of the hydrazide enables facile surface modification and functionalization based on Schiff's base reactions.







Abstract
Energy dissipation based on dynamic fracture of metal ligands is an effective way to toughen hydrogels for specific applications in biomedical and engineering fields. Exploration of new kinds of metal&#8208;ligand coordinates with robust bonding strength is crucial for the facile synthesis of tough gels. Here a hydrogel toughening strategy based on the formation of robust coordination complexes between the hydrazide ligands and zinc ions is reported. The resultant hydrogels exhibit high strength and toughness at room temperature. Their mechanical properties show temperature dependence due to the dynamic nature of coordination bonds.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tough hydrogels&lt;/b&gt; were developed by forming robust hydrazide-Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; coordination complexes. The mechanical properties of the resultant gels exhibited a notable temperature dependence and thus a good shape-memory ability due to the dynamic nature of coordination bonds. The reactive amine group of the hydrazide enables facile surface modification and functionalization based on Schiff's base reactions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy dissipation based on dynamic fracture of metal ligands is an effective way to toughen hydrogels for specific applications in biomedical and engineering fields. Exploration of new kinds of metal-ligand coordinates with robust bonding strength is crucial for the facile synthesis of tough gels. Here a hydrogel toughening strategy based on the formation of robust coordination complexes between the hydrazide ligands and zinc ions is reported. The resultant hydrogels exhibit high strength and toughness at room temperature. Their mechanical properties show temperature dependence due to the dynamic nature of coordination bonds. In addition, the amine group of hydrazides in the gel matrix provides a reactive site for Schiff's base reaction, enabling surface modification without influence on overall mechanical performances of the gel. The hydrazide ligands are easy to synthesize and can coordinate very well with several transition metals. Such a metal-ligand coordination should be suitable to develop tough soft materials with versatile applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>&#963;,&#960;&#8208;Conjugated Bis(germylene) Adducts with NHC and CAACs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Both N&#8208;heterocyclic and cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (NHC and CAACs) form the carbene coordinated &#963;,&#960;&#8208;conjugated adducts from one and the same bis(germylene). Their structures and properties are fundamentally different: while the strong Ge=C double bonds in the bis(germene) outperform the dative bonds in the NHC adduct, the latter serves as precursor for polymers with Ge=Ge double bonds in the reaction with triphenylborane.







Abstract
Heavier tetrylenes attract attention for their potential in synthesis, catalysis and small molecule activation. The coordination by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) and cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (CAACs) results in substantial structural and electronic differences although typically only one of these yields stable derivatives for one and the same tetrylene. We now report both NHC&#8208; and CAAC&#8208;coordination to a bridged bis(germylene) motif. The NHC&#8208;coordinated bis(germylene) exhibits pyramidal germanium centers with lone pairs of electrons, while with CAAC an unprecedented stable bis(germene) with two Ge=C bonds is isolated. Spectroscopic and crystallographic evidence as well as DFT calculations confirm the effects of &#963;,&#960;&#8208;conjugation between the two germanium centers in both cases. The coordination of NHC is reversible as the reaction with BPh3 liberates the transient bis(germylene) and thus provides an alternative low&#8208;temperature route towards polymers with Ge=Ge bonds.

         <title>Clusterization&#8208;Triggered Room Temperature Phosphorescence Supramolecular Assembly with Extraordinary Stimulus&#8208;responsive Features from Nonaromatic Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal approach to construct colors&#8208;tunable RTP supramolecular hybrid co&#8208;assemblies is proposed (AC@amino acid) with excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent properties through co&#8208;assembly of functional layered aminoclay (AC) and various nonconjugated amino acid via simple and environmentally friendly magnetic stirring strategy, which exhibit sensitive stimulus response features towards water and multilevel information encryption application.







Abstract
Achieving stimulus&#8208;responsive performance in room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials especially systems without classic conjugated groups is attractive and important but remains a great challenge. Herein we propose a universal approach to construct colors&#8208;tunable RTP supramolecular co&#8208;assemblies (AC@amino acid) with excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent properties through co&#8208;assembly of functional aminoclay (AC) and nonconjugated amino acid using environmentally friendly strategy. Experimental and theoretical results successfully disclose that the RTP feature is attributable to space conjugation through effective space electronic communications among different &#960; and n (lone pair) electrons of amino acid molecules and the effective stabilization of their triplet state by AC. Meanwhile, their colors&#8208;tunable performances are mainly owing to the co&#8208;existence of clusters with different aggregates degree through recrystallization of amino acid taking AC as a template. Importantly, AC@amino acid exhibit sensitive stimulus response features towards water, yet their RTP performance can be maintained in other solvents, such as ethanol (EtOH). By virtue of this unique feature, multilevel information encryption application were demonstrated. This work provides a unique insight and more deep understanding on designing novel RTP systems without classic conjugated groups. Importantly, their extraordinary stimulus&#8208;responsive performances endow these RTP systems with a highly promising potential for intelligent information encryption applications.

         <title>Normal vs. Inverted Ordering of Reduction Potentials in [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenases Biomimetics: Effect of the Dithiolate Bulk</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical and DFT investigations of the redox behaviours of a series of hexacarbonyl diiron dithiolate complexes [Fe2(CO)6(&#956;&#8208;(SCH2)2X)] with different substitution at the bridge&#8208;head atom show that, in the same experimental conditions, the dithiolate bulk exerts a control in the ordering of reduction potentials (inverted vs. normal) and in the timing of the structural changes coupled to the electron transfers.







Abstract
Three hexacarbonyl diiron dithiolate complexes [Fe2(CO)6(&#956;&#8208;(SCH2)2X)] with different substituted bridgeheads (X=CH2, CEt2, CBn2 (Bn=CH2C6H5)), have been studied under the same experimental conditions by cyclic voltammetry in dichloromethane [NBu4][PF6] 0.2&#8197;M. DFT calculations were performed to rationalize the mechanism of reduction of these compounds. The three complexes undergo a two&#8208;electron transfer whose the mechanism depends on the bulkiness of the dithiolate bridge, which involves a different timing of the structural changes (Fe&#8722;S bond cleavage, inversion of conformation and CO bridging) vs redox steps. The introduction of a bulky group in the dithiolate linker has obviously an effect on normally ordered (as for propanedithiolate (pdt)) or inverted (pdtEt2, pdtBn2) reduction potentials. Et&#8594;Bn replacement is not theoretically predicted to alter the geometry and energy of the most stable mono&#8208;reduced and bi&#8208;reduced forms but such a replacement alters the kinetics of the electron transfer vs the structural changes.

         <title>Tandem Hydroformylation&#8208;Aldol Condensation Reaction Enabled by Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic amounts of Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 promoted the aldol condensation in a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation reaction. The investigation of the system showed that the cobalt catalyst and Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 facilitate the aldol condensation in a cooperative fashion. Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 activates the aldehyde product by adsorption, as shown by DFT.







Abstract
The tandem hydroformylation&#8208;aldol condensation (tandem HF&#8208;AC) reaction offers an efficient synthetic route to the synthesis of industrially relevant products. The addition of Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 to the cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation of 1&#8208;hexene enables tandem HF&#8208;AC under milder pressure and temperature conditions than the aldox process, where zinc salts are added to cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation reactions to promote aldol condensation. The yield of the aldol condensation products increases by up to 17&#8197;times compared to that of the homogeneous reaction without MOF and up to 5&#8197;times compared to the aldox catalytic system. Both Co2(CO)8 and Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 are required to significantly enhance the activity of the catalytic system. Density functional theory simulations and Fourier&#8208;transform infrared experiments show that heptanal, the product of hydroformylation, adsorbs on the open metal site (OMS) of Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74, thereby increasing the electrophilic character of the carbonyl carbon atom and facilitating the condensation.

         <title>The Origin of Catalysis and Regioselectivity of Lewis Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions with Tropone
</title>

         <dc:description>
Quantum chemical activation strain analyses reveal how the regioselectivity between [4+2] and [8+2] cycloaddition reactions of tropone can be steered by the use of Lewis acids, which catalyze the reactions via a LUMO&#8208;lowering effect.







Abstract
We have studied the uncatalyzed and Lewis acid (LA)&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition reaction between tropone and 1,1&#8208;dimethoxyethene using dispersion&#8208;corrected relativistic density functional theory (DFT). The LA catalysts BF3, B(C6H5)3, and B(C6F5)3 efficiently accelerate both the competing [4+2] and [8+2] cycloaddition reactions by lowering the activation barrier up to 12&#8197;kcal mol&#8722;1 compared to the uncatalyzed reaction. Our study reveals that the LA catalyst promotes both cycloaddition reaction pathways by LUMO&#8208;lowering catalysis and demonstrates that Pauli&#8208;lowering catalysis is not always the operative catalytic mechanism in cycloaddition reactions. Judicious choice of the LA catalyst can effectively impart regiocontrol of the cycloaddition: B(C6H5)3 furnishes the [8+2] adduct while B(C6F5)3 yields the [4+2] adduct. We discovered that the regioselectivity shift finds its origin in the ability of the LA to absorb distortion by adopting a trigonal pyramidal geometry around the boron atom.

         <title>Disulphide Cross&#8208;Linked Ultrashort Peptide Hydrogelator for Water Remediation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cysteine&#8208;containing ultrashort peptide hydrogelator undergoes disulphide bond formation and forms a self&#8208;supporting, thixotropic, insoluble hydrogel via both covalent and non&#8208;covalent interactions. The resultant hydrogelator was exploited to remove toxic organic dyes from contaminated water in the gel phase and solid supports, indicating its potential applicability for water remediation.







Abstract
A single amino acid in a peptide sequence can play an important role to tune the self&#8208;assembly and hydrogelation behaviour. Here, a C&#8208;terminal cysteine&#8208;containing ultrashort peptide hydrogelator forms hydrogel through non&#8208;covalent and covalent interactions. Interestingly, the hydrogel is insoluble in water and buffer solutions at different pH values (1&#8208;13) and is thixotropic and injectable. In recent years, removing dyes from contaminated water has become a significant concern because of the shortage of freshwater resources. Therefore, the adsorption of dyes through a reliable, straightforward, nontoxic, cheap, and environmentally friendly adsorbent has become a popular topic. Hence, the hydrogelator was exploited to remove organic dyes from wastewater, harnessing its applicability in the gel phase and solid supports (filter paper and cotton).

         <title>Iron&#8208;Mediated C&#8722;H Functionalization of Unactivated Alkynes for the Synthesis of Derivatized Dihydropyrrolones: Regioselectivity Under Thermodynamic Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclopentadienyliron dicarbonyl&#8208;based complexes present opportunities for underexplored disconnections in synthesis. Access to challenging dihydropyrrolone products is achieved by propargylic C&#8722;H functionalization of alkynes for the formation of cyclic organoiron species. Excellent regioselectivity for unsymmetrical alkynes is observed in many cases. Notably, regioselectivity under these stoichiometric conditions diverges from those observed previously under catalysis, occurring at the more&#8208;substituted terminus of the alkyne, and allowing for methine functionalization and the formation of quaternary centers. Divergent demetallation of the intermediate organoiron complexes gives access to chemically diverse products which are further amenable to functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Stepwise Stimuli&#8208;Responsive, Multicolor&#8208;Chromic Perylene Bisimides/Polyvinyl Alcohol Coassembly System for Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The issue of information security has become a concern in all aspects of daily life, prompting the development of encryption technologies. Therein, optical encryption using color/graphical patterns holds great potential. However, current approaches generally rely on monochromic change upon one or more stimuli, limiting their further application in advanced confidential encryption. Herein, we proposed a delicate strategy based on a coassembly system of perylene bisimides (PBI)/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), which demonstrates stepwise stimuli response and multicolor changes. The color of the supramolecular system changes from red to purple under the stimulus of UV light, and varies to orange when exposed to water. The multidimensional chromic response is tactfully achieved via an evolution process including the generation, packing rearrangement and quenching of PBI radical anions/dianions. With the virtues of photo&#8208; and hydrochromism, this novel coassembly system was successfully employed for advanced anticounterfeiting and versatile information encryption applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A solid polymer electrolyte is developed and employed in lithium&#8208;metal batteries of relevant interest. The material employes crystalline polyethylene glycol dimethyl ether (PEGDME), LiTFSI and LiNO3 salts, and SiO2 ceramic filler. The electrolyte shows ionic conductivity over than 10&#8208;4 S cm&#8208;1 at room temperature and approaching 10&#8208;3 S cm&#8208;1 at 60 &#176;C, Li+ transference number exceeding 0.3, electrochemical stability from 0 to 4.4 V vs. Li+/Li, lithium stripping/deposition overvoltage below 0.08 V, and electrode/electrolyte interphase resistance of 400 &#937;. Thermogravimetry indicates that the electrolyte stands up to 200 &#176;C without significant weight loss, while FT&#8208;IR spectroscopy suggests the dissolution of the LiTFSI conducting salt in the polymer. The electrolyte is used in solid state cells with various cathodes, including olivine LiFePO4 exploiting the Li&#8208;insertion, sulfur&#8208;carbon composite operating through Li&#8208;conversion, and an oxygen electrode in which reduction and evolution reactions (i.e., ORR/OER) evolve on carbon&#8208;coated gas diffusion layer (GDL). The cells reversibly operate at the room temperature with a capacity of 140 mAh g&#8208;1 at 3.4 V for LiFePO4, 400 mAh g&#8208;1 at 2 V for sulfur electrode, and 500 mAh g&#8208;1 at 2.5 V for oxygen. The results suggest the electrolyte for application in room&#8208;temperature solid polymer cells.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Organocatalytic asymmetric transformation of common aromatic heterocycles via in situ formation of highly reactive dearomatized ortho&#8208;quinodimethane diene species and subsequent [4+2] cycloaddition with suitable dienophiles has become a powerful tool to enter cyclohexane&#8208;fused heterocycles. Most of these reactions were previously applied to benzofused heterocycles or poorly aromatic rings.

         <title>N&#8208;alkylated pyridoxal derivatives as negative electrolyte materials for aqueous organic flow batteries: Computational screening</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;functionalized pyridinium frameworks derived from the three major vitamers of vitamin B6, pyridoxal, pyridoxamine and pyridoxine, have been screened computationally for consideration as negative electrode materials in aqueous organic flow batteries. A molecular database including the structure and the one&#8208;electron standard reduction potential of related pyridinium derivatives has been generated using a computational protocol that combines semiempirical and DFT quantum chemical methods. The predicted reduction potentials span a broad range for the investigated pyridinium frameworks, but pyridoxal derivatives, particularly those involving electron withdrawing substituents, have potentials compatible with the electrochemical stability window of aqueous electrolytes. The stability of radicals formed upon one&#8208;electron reduction has been analyzed by a new computational tool proposed recently for large&#8208;scale computational screening.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Oxonitridophosphates exhibit the potential for broad structural diversity, making them promising host&#8208;compounds in phosphor&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diode applications. The novel monophyllo&#8208;oxonitridophosphate &#946;&#8208;MgSrP3N5O2 was obtained by using the high&#8208;pressure multianvil technique. The crystal structure was solved and refined based on single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data and confirmed by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction. &#946;&#8208;MgSrP3N5O2 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Cmme (no. 67, a = 8.8109(6), b = 12.8096(6), c = 4.9065(3) &#197;, Z = 4) and has a structure related to that of Ba2CuSi2O7. DFT calculations were performed to investigate the phase transition from &#945;&#8208; to &#946;&#8208;MgSrP3N5O2 and to confirm the latter as the corresponding high&#8208;pressure polymorph. Furthermore, the luminescence properties of Eu2+ doped samples of both polymorphs were investigated and discussed, showing blue and cyan emission, respectively (&#945;&#8208;MgSrP3N5O2; &#955;max = 438 nm, fwhm = 46 nm/2396 cm&#8722;1; &#946;&#8208;MgSrP3N5O2; &#955;max = 502 nm, fwhm = 42 nm/1670 cm&#8722;1).</dc:description>

         <title>A Novel Method for the Synthesis of Merocyanines: New Photophysical Possibilities for a Well&#8208;Known Class of Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new, transformative methodology for the preparation of rhodols and other merocyanines from readily available tetrafluorohydroxybenzaldehyde and aminophenols has been developed. It is now possible to prepare merocyanines bearing three fluorine atoms and additional conjugated rings and the whole one&#8208;pot process occurs under neutral, mild conditions. Three heretofore unknown merocyanine&#8208;based architectures were prepared using this strategy from aminonaphthols and 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins. The ability to change the structure of original rhodol chromophore into &#960;&#8208;expanded merocyanines translates to a comprehensive method for the modulation of photophysical properties such as shifting the absorption and emission bands across almost the entire visible spectrum, reaching a huge Stokes shift i.e. 4800 cm&#8722;1, brightness ca. 80,000 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1, two&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;section above 150 GM and switching&#8208;on/off solvatofluorochromism. A detailed investigation allowed to rationalize the different spectroscopic behavior of rhodols and novel merocyanines, addressing solvatochromism and two&#8208;photon absorption.</dc:description>

         <title>Stability and Reversible Oxidation of Sub&#8208;Nanometric Cu5 Metal Clusters: Integrated Experimental Study and Theoretical Modeling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sub&#8208;nanometer Metal clusters have special physical and chemical properties, significantly different from those of nanoparticles. However, there is a major concern about their thermal stability and susceptibility to oxidation. In situ X&#8208;ray Absorption spectroscopy and Near Ambient Pressure X&#8208;ray Photoelectron spectroscopy results reveal that supported Cu5 clusters are resistant to irreversible oxidation at least up to 773 K, even in the presence of 0.15 mbar of oxygen. These experimental findings can be formally described by a theoretical model which combines dispersion&#8208;corrected DFT and first principles thermochemistry revealing that most of the adsorbed O2 molecules are transformed into superoxo and peroxo species by an interplay of collective charge transfer within the network of Cu atoms and large amplitude &#8220;breathing&#8221; motions. A chemical phase diagram for Cu oxidation state of the Cu5&#8208;oxygen system is presented, clearly different from the already known bulk and nano&#8208;structured chemistry of Cu.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Chiral aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) molecules have drawn attention for their helical self&#8208;assembly and special optical properties. The helical self&#8208;assembly of AIE&#8208;active chiral non&#8208;linear main&#8208;chain polymers would produced some desired optical features. In this work, a series of V&#8208;shaped chiral AIE&#8208;active polyamides P1&#8208;C3, P1&#8208;C6, P1&#8208;C12 and linear P2&#8208;C3, P2&#8208;C6, bearing n&#8208;propyl/hexyl/dodecyl side&#8208;chains, based on tetraphenyl&#8208;butadiene (TPB) were prepared. All of the target main&#8208;chain polymers exhibit distinct AIE characteristics. The polymer P1&#8208;C6 with moderate length alkyl chains shows better AIE properties. The V&#8208;shaped main&#8208;chains and the chiral induction of (1R,2R)&#8208;(+)&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine in each repeating&#160;unit promote the polymer chains display helical conformations, and multiple helical polymer chains induce nano&#8208;fibers helicity when the polymer chains aggregate and self&#8208;assemble in THF/H2O mixtures. Simultaneously, the helical conformation polymer chains and helical nano&#8208;fibers cause P1&#8208;C6 produce strong CD signals with positive Cotton effect. Moreover, P1&#8208;C6 could also occur fluorescence quenching response to Fe3+ selectively with a low detection limit of 3.48 &#956;mol/L.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel sugar&#8208;bridged fullerene dumbbells and their interaction with the [10]cycloparaphenylene nanoring</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the synthesis and characterization of four dumbbell&#8208;shaped fullerene molecules bridged by isosorbide \ isomannide moieties. Their electrochemical behaviour and complexation with [10]cycloparaphenylene ([10]CPP) were also investigated. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) of fullerene dumbbells showed high electron affinity, highlighting their ability to interact well with electron&#8208;donating counterparts such as carbon nanorings, which are charge and shape complementary. Thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of complexation were studied by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and additional information about binding stoichiometries was obtained by NMR titration experiments. Two different approaches were used, resulting in bridged cyclopropane&#8208; and furan&#8208;based structures. Regardless of the type of linker, all derivatives formed conventional 2:1 complexes [10]CPP2&#8835;C60 derivative. However, the methano&#8208;dumbbell molecules showed different binding behaviour as mono&#8208;, bis&#8208;pseudorotaxanes as well as oligomers (polymers) were detected. The formation of linear polymers could be of great importance for solar energy conversion processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Reexamine the emergence and stability of the square cylinder phase in block copolymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, a few AB&#8208;type multiblock copolymers have been successfully designed to form stable square cylinder phase based on self&#8208;consistent field theory (SCFT) calculations. The previous works only identify the stability region of the square phase but not analyzing its stability, which is closely related to the free&#8208;energy landscape. In this work, we have reexamined the stability of the square phase in $\mathrm{B_1 A_1 B_2 A_2 B_3}$ linear pentablock and $\mathrm{(B_1AB_2)_5}$ star triblock copolymers by drawing the free&#8208;energy landscape with respect to the two dimensions of a rectangular unit cell. Our results demonstrate that the square phase continuously transfers to the rectangular phase as
the degree of packing frustration is gradually released. Moreover, the prolate contour lines of the free&#8208;energy landscape indicate the weak stability of the square phase in the $\mathrm{B_1 A_1 B_2 A_2 B_3}$ copolymer. In contrast, the stability of the square phase is notably improved in the $\mathrm{(B_1AB_2)_5}$ copolymer due to its enhanced concentration of bridging configurations. Our work sheds light on the understanding of the stability of the square cylinder phase in block copolymers. Accordingly, we propose some possible strategies for further designing new AB&#8208;type block copolymer systems to obtain more stable square phase.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkali Metal Halide Ion&#8208;Pair Binding in Conformationally Dynamic Halogen Bonding Heteroditopic [2]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of heteroditopic halogen bonding (XB) [2]rotaxanes were prepared via a combination of passive and active metal template&#8208;directed strategies. The ability of the [2]rotaxanes to bind alkali metal halide ion&#8208;pairs was investigated by extensive 1H NMR titration studies, wherein detailed analysis of cation, anion and ion&#8208;pair affinity measurements indicate dramatic positive cooperative enhancements in halide anion association upon either Na+ or K+ pre&#8208;complexation. We demonstrate that careful consideration of multiple, parallel and competing binding equilibria is essential when interpreting observed 1H NMR spectral changes in ion&#8208;pair receptor systems, especially those which exhibit dynamic behaviour. Importantly, in comparison to XB [2]catenane analogues, these neutral XB heteroditopic [2]rotaxane host systems demonstrated that despite their relatively weaker cation and anion binding abilities, they exhibit a notably higher level of positive cooperativity for alkali metal halide ion&#8208;pair binding, highlighting the role of greater co&#8208;conformational adaptive behaviour in mechanically&#8208;bonded hosts for the purposes of charged species recognition.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Development of miniaturized lab&#8208;on&#8208;chip devices for the detection of rapid and specific small molecule&#8208;protein binding interactions at very low concentrations holds significant importance in drug discovery and biomedical applications.

The 12&#8208;helix conformation of the &#945;,&#947;&#8208;hybrid peptide observed in the single crystals, self&#8208;assembled into nanotubes in an aqueous environment with exposed cysteine thiols for small molecule conjugation. The binding of streptavidin to the covalently linked biotin on the surface of nanotubes was detected at the picomolar concentrations. No change in the capacitance and impedance were observed in the absence of either immobilized biotin or protein streptavidin. The functionalizable hybrid peptide nanotubes reported here pave the way for the label&#8208;free detection of various small molecule protein interactions at very low concentrations.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclization, Decyclization, and Metallacyclization of Pyridine&#8208;Substituted Homopropargylic Alcohols on Ruthenium(II) and Osmium(II) Centers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Systematic investigations on the reactions between cis&#8208;[M(dppm)2Cl2] (M = Ru/Os; dppm = 1,1bis(diphenylphosphino)methane) and pyridine/quinoline substituted homopropargylic alcohols uncovered the diverse Ru(II)/Os(II)&#8208;induced alkyne activation pathways. The alkynes underwent cyclization on M via a &#8220;non&#8208;vinylidene&#8221; pathway at lower temperatures, resulting in alkenyl intermediates which might further metallacyclize to give metallapyrroloindolizines. Conversely, reactions at higher temperatures induced alkyne cyclization on M via a &#8220;vinylidene&#8221; pathway, affording cyclic oxacarbene complexes. Additionally, a rare decyclization mechanism was observed during the transformation of a metallacyclization&#8208;resistant alkenyl complex into a cyclic oxacarbene complex. DFT calculations were employed to validate the experimental findings. Overall, these results not only provide insights into controlling alkyne activation pathways, but also offer new strategies for preparing metalated heterocyclic and metallacyclic complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Overall Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction over Heterogeneous Semiconductor Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The overall photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (PCRR), which uses solar energy to convert CO2 and H2O into chemical feedstocks or fuels without sacrificial reagents, plays a momentous role in CO2 utilization and solar energy conversion. However, significant challenges remain in achieving efficient conversion. Researchers have explored various strategies to realize the overall PCRR efficiently. In this review, we first explain the criteria for evaluating the overall PCRR and then summarize the following strategies developed over the past decade to promote it: self&#8208;driving material development, Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction construction, cocatalyst loading, heteroatom doping, surface vacancy creation, and carrier&#8208;material matching. Finally, we discuss essential future research directions in the field. Through this comprehensive review, we aim to provide strategic guidance for the development of efficient overall PCRR systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Cs2SnBr6/rGO Composite for Photocatalytic Selective Oxidation of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5&#8208;Diformylfuran</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cs2SnBr6/rGO composite exhibits excellent photocatalytic performance for the selective oxidation of biomass&#8208;derived HMF, obtaining&gt;99.5&#8201;% conversion of HMF and 88&#8201;% selectivity of DFF with the synergistic effect of &#8901;O2&#8722; and 1O2. This study shows that Cs2SnBr6&#8208;based perovskite provides more possibilities and options in employing highly efficient and environment&#8208;stable lead&#8208;free perovskites.







Abstract
Severe poisonousness and prolonged instability existing in organic&#8208;inorganic lead&#8208;based perovskite are two matters seriously hindering its potential future application in photocatalysis. Therefore, it is particularly important to explore ecology&#8208;friendly, air&#8208;stable and highly active metal&#8208;halide perovskites. Herein, a new and stable lead&#8208;free perovskite Cs2SnBr6 decorated with reduced graphene oxide (rGO), is synthesized and employed in the photocatalytic organic conversion. The as&#8208;prepared Cs2SnBr6 is ultrastable, exhibiting no clear changes after being placed in the air for six months. The Cs2SnBr6/rGO composite shows excellent photocatalytic activity in photo&#8208;driven&#8208;oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to high value enclosed 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran (DFF), achieving&gt;99.5&#8201;% conversion of HMF and 88&#8201;% DFF selectivity in the presence of green oxidant O2. Comprehensive characterizations disclose a multistep reaction mechanism, demonstrating that the molecular oxygen, photogenerated carriers, &#8901;O2&#8722; and 1O2 altogether synergistically participate in the effective photo&#8208;driven conversion of HMF to DFF. This work expands the material gallery towards selective organic conversion and environmentally friendly perovskite options for photocatalytic application.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe poisonousness and prolonged instability existing in organic-inorganic lead-based perovskite are two matters seriously hindering its potential future application in photocatalysis. Therefore, it is particularly important to explore ecology-friendly, air-stable and highly active metal-halide perovskites. Herein, a new and stable lead-free perovskite Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SnBr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; decorated with reduced graphene oxide (rGO), is synthesized and employed in the photocatalytic organic conversion.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Amphoteric &#945;&#8208;Haloalkenyl Boronates by Halogenative Semipinacol Rearrangement of B(MIDA)&#8208;Propargylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A halogen&#8208;induced halogenative semipinacol rearrangement of B(MIDA)&#8208;propargylic alcohols is reported herein. The reaction proceeded under mild conditions to access a variety of synthetically valuable carbonyl&#8208;containing &#945;&#8208;haloalkenyl boronates with moderate to good yields and excellent stereoselectivities.







Abstract
The facile synthesis of stereo&#8208;defined and transformable functionality&#8208;enriched building blocks is of great importance in modern organic chemistry, as it allows the rapid and divergent assembly of complex molecules. Herein a halogen electrophile (N&#8208;bromosuccinimide and N&#8208;iodosuccinimide) initiated semipinacol rearrangement reaction of B(MIDA)&#8208;propargylic alcohols (MIDA=N&#8208;methyliminodiacetyl) by aryl migration towards the synthesis of amphoteric &#945;&#8208;haloalkenyl boronates in moderate to good yields with excellent stereoselectivities is reported. The value of the products is evidenced by their ability to undergo divergent conversions to polysubstituted alkenes through manipulation of the C&#8722;B and C&#8722;X (X=Br, I) bonds and the carbonyl group.

         <title>Paramagnetic Relaxation Agents for Enhancing Temporal Resolution and Sensitivity in Multinuclear FlowNMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the right amount of an easily available chromium(III) complex bearing a bulky acetylacetonato ligand to keep it chemically inert, NMR spectra acquired in continuous flow give much better data due to significantly reduced polarisation and relaxation times without undue peak broadening or loss of 2D methods.







Abstract
Sensitivity in FlowNMR spectroscopy for reaction monitoring often suffers from low levels of pre&#8208;magnetisation due to limited residence times of the sample in the magnetic field. While this in&#8208;flow effect is tolerable for high sensitivity nuclei such as 1H and 19F, it significantly reduces the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio in 31P and 13C spectra, making FlowNMR impractical for low sensititvity nuclei at low concentrations. Paramagnetic relaxation agents (PRAs), which enhance polarisation and spin&#8208;lattice relaxation, could eliminate the adverse in&#8208;flow effect and improve the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. Herein, [Co(acac)3], [Mn(acac)3], [Fe(acac)3], [Cr(acac)3], [Ni(acac)2]3, [Gd(tmhd)3] and [Cr(tmhd)3] are investigated for their effectiveness in improving signal intensity per unit time in FlowNMR applications under the additional constraint of chemical inertness towards catalytically active transition metal complexes. High&#8208;spin Cr(III) acetylacetonates emerged as the most effective compounds, successfully reducing 31P T1 values four&#8208; to five&#8208;fold at PRA concentrations as low as 10&#8197;mM without causing adverse line broadening. Whereas [Cr(acac)3] showed signs of chemical reactivity with a mixture of triphenylphosphine, triphenylphosphine oxide and triphenylphosphate over the course of several hours at 80&#176; C, the bulkier [Cr(tmhd)3] was stable and equally effective as a PRA under these conditions. Compatibility with a range of representative transition metal complexes often used in homogeneous catalysis has been investigated, and application of [Cr(tmhd)3] in significantly improving 1H and 31P{1H} FlowNMR data quality in a Rh&#8208;catalysed hydroformylation reaction has been demonstrated. With the PRA added, 13C relaxation times were reduced more than six&#8208;fold, allowing quantitative reaction monitoring of substrate consumption and product formation by 13C{1H} FlowNMR spectroscopy at natural abundance.

         <dc:description>O3&#8208;type Fe/Mn&#8208;based layered oxide cathode materials with abundant reserves have a promising prospect in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the electrochemical reversibility of most O3&#8208;type Fe/Mn&#8208;based oxide cathode materials is still not high enough. Herein, the effect of different Cu contents on the electrochemical properties of O3&#8208;NaFe0.50Mn0.50O2 materials is systematically investigated. The as&#8208;prepared NaFe0.30Mn0.50Cu0.20O2 cathode achieves the synergistic optimization of the interface and bulk phase, and showes superior electrochemical performance, with an initial discharge specific capacity of 114 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 C, a capacity retention rate of 94% after 100 cycles at 0.5 C, and excellent chemical stability in air and water. In addition, the sodium ion full battery based on NaFe0.30Mn0.50Cu0.20O2 cathode and hard carbon anode has a capacity retention rate of 81% after 100 cycles. This research provides a useful approach for the preparation of low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance O3&#8208;type layered cathode materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of cost&#8208;effective transition metal catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critical for the production of hydrogen fuel from water splitting. Low&#8208;cost and efficient stainless steel&#8208;based catalysts are expected to replace the scarce platinum group metals for large&#8208;scale energy applications. Here in this work, we report the conversion of commonly available inexpensive and easily accessible 434&#8208;L stainless steel (SS) into highly active and stable electrodes by corrosion and sulfuration strategies. The NixFe1&#8208;xS layer as a pre&#8208;catalyst and S&#8208;doped&#160;NixFe oxyhydroxides in situ formed on the catalyst surface are the true active species for OER.&#160;The optimized 434&#8208;L stainless steel&#8208;based electrocatalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 298 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2&#160;in 1.0 M KOH with a small OER kinetics (the Tafel slope of 54.8 mV dec&#8208;1) and good stability.&#160;This work reveals the 434&#8208;L alloy stainless steel with Fe and Cr as the main elements can be used as qualified OER catalysts by surface modification, along with a new mentality to solve the energy and resource waste problems.</dc:description>

         <title>Effects of Central Elements on the Properties of Group 13 Dialdiminate Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Element&#8208;dependent photophysical properties were observed from dialdiminate complexes containing Group&#8197;13 elements. Alteration of the central elements results in a shift in the absorption wavelength, an enhancement of the responsiveness toward Lewis bases, and the appearance of the ligand exchange reactions. In this paper, the mechanisms are explored.







Abstract
Novel luminescent dialdiminate complexes of the Group&#8197;13 elements were prepared to evaluate the effects of the central element on their properties. We demonstrate that their absorption wavelength and the response to Lewis bases apparently depend on the central atom. The aluminum complex exhibited the absorption band in the higher&#8208;energy region than the gallium and indium congeners. Theoretical calculations suggest that the aluminum complex has a lower&#8208;lying highest&#8208;occupied molecular orbital than the other complexes. Additionally, the emission intensity of the aluminum complex clearly changed in response to a Lewis base. Quantum chemical calculations suggest that these element&#8208;dependent optical properties could originate from the difference in the electric charges on the central elements. Interestingly, the ligand exchange reactions were observed in the indium complexes together with the changes in the optical properties and controlled by the addition of InCl3 and InMe3. Furthermore, all the complexes showed aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) and crystallization&#8208;induced emission enhancement (CIEE) properties. These results lead to proposing a practical strategy for manipulating the optoelectronic properties coupled with the reactivities of complexes by choosing the central elements in the same group.

         <title>Remote Electronic Effect of Chiral N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalyst on an Asymmetric Benzoin Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of remote electron&#8208;withdrawing groups in N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalyst increased enantioselectivity of the benzoin reaction at the cost of the reaction rate. The increased enantioselectivity was rationalized by DFT calculations with noncovalent&#8208;interaction and distortion/interaction&#8208;energy analyses.







Abstract
A remote electronic effect of chiral aminoindanol&#8208;derived N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalyst on an asymmetric benzoin reaction was investigated. The catalyst bearing remote electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents increased enantioselectivity of the reaction at the cost of the reaction rate. DFT calculations rationalized the increased enantioselectivity.

         <title>Helical Anatase Titanium Nanotubes through a Protected Crystallization Strategy for Enhanced Photocatalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel helical anatase titanium nanotube was prepared through a protected crystallization strategy for photocatalytic hydrogen production. Helical anatase titanium nanotube possesses abundant defects of oxygen vacancy and Ti3+ species owing to the twisted structure and exhibits superior photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production.







Abstract
Helical structure in catalysts has attracted attention and been recently investigated for various catalytic reactions. However, helical transition metal oxides suffer from uncontrollable crystallization processes at high temperatures when being transformed from an amorphous phase into a crystalline structure. Herein, we report a helical anatase TiO2 nanotube for the first time, which has been prepared using a protected crystallization strategy in the confined space of silica. A single chirality of helical TiO2 has been used to track the ordering of the twisted structure. The twisted structure in helical anatase TiO2 nanotube is maintained after a vigorous crystallization process. Helical anatase TiO2 nanotubes possess more accessible active sites and abundant defects of oxygen vacancy and Ti3+ species owing to the twisted structure. The obtained helical anatase TiO2 nanotube exhibits superior photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production without adding any co&#8208;catalysts. This work provides new insights into the role of helical structure in transition metal&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>Stimuli Responsive Features of Organic RTP Materials: An Intriguing Carbazole&#8208;Cyclic Triimidazole Derivative</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The triimidazole&#8208;carbazole derivative TT&#8208;Ph&#8208;Cz here synthesized possesses high conformational freedom resulting in rigidochromic and multi&#8208;stimuli responsive emissive behavior. The origin of the compound stimuli&#8208;responsiveness is interpreted through X&#8208;ray diffraction and DFT&#8208;TDDFT studies. Interconversion between TT&#8208;Ph&#8208;Cz solvated and unsolvated phases occurs through solvent fuming and/or thermal treatment. Phosphorescent aqueous nanoaggregates are prepared from solvent/non&#8208;solvent solutions.







Abstract
Stimuli responsive luminescent materials possessing room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are extremely desirable for various applications. The here investigated derivative of cyclic triimidazole (TT) functionalized with carbazole (Cz), namely TT&#8208;Ph&#8208;Cz, belongs to this class. TT&#8208;Ph&#8208;Cz possesses high conformational freedom resulting in rigidochromic and multi&#8208;stimuli responsive emissive behavior. It has been isolated as MeOH&#8208;solvated and de&#8208;solvated forms characterized by distinctive emissive features. In particular, the solvated form, in which hydrogen bonds with MeOH inhibit competitive non&#8208;radiative deactivation channels, possesses a higher quantum yield associated with a strong phosphorescence contribution which is preserved in DMSO/water solutions.

         <title>A Blue Light and Two&#8208;Photon Activatable Rhodamine Fluorophore</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigation and regulation of biological structures and functions with light require precise characterization of the used illumination and imaging systems. Photoactivatable fluorophores (PAFs) deliver fluorescent signals upon light irradiation, therefore enabling spatiotemporal control of fluorescence distribution. Our immobilized photoactivatable rhodamine derivative can be activated by both blue light (1P) and NIR light (2P), providing stable high&#8208;contrast images by laser scanning microscopy.







Abstract
Photoactivatable fluorophores (PAFs) are powerful tools for biological imaging applications because they provide spatiotemporal control of fluorescence distribution. Many of the existing PAFs can only be activated by UV irradiation. In our study, we present a blue light (1P) and NIR light (2P) activatable rhodamine fluorophore. Next to the description of the synthesis and the investigation of the photoreaction, we demonstrate the use of our PAF in the context of laser scanning microscopy. By immobilization of our PAF in a hydrogel, we were able to write and read spatially resolved illumination patterns with excellent contrast after both one&#8208;photon and two&#8208;photon excitation.

         <title>Structural Perspective into the Interaction of an Oncogenesis&#8208;Relevant pre&#8208;miRNA G&#8208;Quadruplex Ligand Carrier with the Protein Nucleolin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural study of the complex between nucleolin, a protein involved in a myriad of human diseases, and the RNA G4 found in pre&#8208;miRNA 149 stabilized by the compound C8, known for its G4 stabilizing properties, was conducted. The results provide important molecular determinants at the atomic level and may pave the way for future investigations in the field.







Abstract
The structural determinants of the interaction of the G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) motif found in precursor miRNA 149 (rG4) with the acridine orange derivative C8, a G4 ligand stabilizer possessing anticancer activity, and the protein nucleolin (overexpressed in cancer cells) were investigated by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. For the rG4/C8 complex, the results revealed a strong stabilizing interaction between the aromatic core and the iodinated ring of the C8 ligand with the rG4 structure. The NMR study revealed also different interaction patterns between nucleolin and rG4 and nucleolin and rG4/C8 complex. In the absence of the ligand, rG4 establishes interactions with polar residues of the protein while for the rG4/C8 complex, these contacts are mainly established with amino acids that have hydrophobic side chains. However, nucleolin chemical shift perturbation studies in the presence of rG4 or rG4/C8 reveal the same location between domains 1 and 2 of the protein, which suggests that the rG4 and rG4/C8 complex bind in this region. This puzzling structural study opens a new framework to study rG4/ligand/nucleolin complexes that might impact the biogenesis of miRNA 149.

     alt="Structural Perspective into the Interaction of an Oncogenesis-Relevant pre-miRNA G-Quadruplex Ligand Carrier with the Protein Nucleolin"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Structural study&lt;/b&gt; of the complex between nucleolin, a protein involved in a myriad of human diseases, and the RNA G4 found in pre-miRNA 149 stabilized by the compound C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, known for its G4 stabilizing properties, was conducted. The results provide important molecular determinants at the atomic level and may pave the way for future investigations in the field.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structural determinants of the interaction of the G-quadruplex (G4) motif found in precursor miRNA 149 (rG4) with the acridine orange derivative C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, a G4 ligand stabilizer possessing anticancer activity, and the protein nucleolin (overexpressed in cancer cells) were investigated by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. For the rG4/C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; complex, the results revealed a strong stabilizing interaction between the aromatic core and the iodinated ring of the C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; ligand with the rG4 structure. The NMR study revealed also different interaction patterns between nucleolin and rG4 and nucleolin and rG4/C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; complex. In the absence of the ligand, rG4 establishes interactions with polar residues of the protein while for the rG4/C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; complex, these contacts are mainly established with amino acids that have hydrophobic side chains. However, nucleolin chemical shift perturbation studies in the presence of rG4 or rG4/C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; reveal the same location between domains 1 and 2 of the protein, which suggests that the rG4 and rG4/C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; complex bind in this region.

         <title>Stable Spiro&#8208;Fused Diarylaminyl Radicals: A New Type of a Neutral Mixed&#8208;Valence System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new type of neutral mixed&#8208;valence system was synthesized using a facile one&#8208;pot procedure. The spiro&#8208;conjugated framework is additionally &#8220;fastened&#8221; with a biphenyl bridge, which does not directly participate in spin delocalization but makes the molecule stable and influences the reorganization energy and the energy barrier of the intramolecular electron transfer. The in&#8208;depth experimental and quantum&#8208;chemical study allowed determining the radicals as the Class II Robin&#8208;Day&#8208;mixed&#8208;valence systems. The structure of the radicals was confirmed by the X&#8208;ray data, which are relatively rare for Class II MV molecules. Advanced properties of the radicals, such as an ambipolar redox behavior and panchromatic absorption in the visible and NIR regions, along with their stability, make them of interest for materials science. All radicals demonstrate the SOMO&#8208;HOMO inversion phenomenon, which was supported by the DFT and the experimental study.</dc:description>

         <title>Template&#8208;assisted Fabrication of O&#8208;doped CoP Microflowers with Optimal Electronic Modulation for Electrochemical Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring efficient, affordable and stable electrocatalyst toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is of great scientific significance for the practical implementation of the water splitting. The heteroatom doping represents a serviceable strategy to further elevate the catalytic performance for a transition metal&#8208;based electrocatalyst because of the electronic regulation effect. Herein, a reliable self&#8208;sacrificial template&#8208;engaged approach is proposed to synthesize O&#8208;doped CoP (denoted as O&#8208;CoP) microflowers, which simultaneously considers the regualtion of electronic configuration via anion doping and sufficient exposure of active sites via nanostructure engineering. The suitable O incorporation content in CoP matrix could tremendously modify the electronic configuration, accelerate the charge transfer, promote the exposure of active sites, strengthen the electrical conductivity, and adjust the adsorption state of H*. Consequently, the optimized O&#8208;CoP microflowers with optimal O concentration display a remarkable HER property with a small overpotential of 125 mV to afford a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2, a low Tafel slope of 68 mV dec&#8208;1 and long&#8208;term durability for 32 h under alkaline electrolyte. The integration of anion incorporation and architecture engineering in this work will bring in a depth insight for the design of low&#8208;cost and effective electrocatalysts in energy conversion and storage systems.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Lewis acidic bismuth compounds have found catalytic applications in the reduction of unsaturated bonds. In this work, we present the inferences from the mechanistic studies on the catalytic reduction of ketones and phosphine oxides using the organobismuth dication [NMe2C6H4Bi(L)3][Al{OC(CF3)3}4] in the presence of silanes as reducing agents. Experiments and computations converge to a Si&#8208;H activation pathway in the reduction process.</dc:description>

         <title>Radical&#8208;Based Convergent Paired Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemistry offers a sustainable platform for discovering reactions involving single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) that generates highly reactive and synthetically versatile radical species. Compared with photochemistry similarly specializing in SET which requires expensive photocatalysts, electrochemistry employs low&#8208;cost electricity to drive the electron flow. Paired electrolysis makes use of both half&#8208;reactions, thus obviating the need for sacrificial reactions and maximizing the atom and energy economy. In convergent paired electrolysis, anodic oxidation and cathodic reduction occur simultaneously to generate two intermediates, which are then coupled to furnish the product. It represents a distinctive approach to challenging redox&#8208;neutral reactions. However, the gap between the two electrodes makes it hard for a reactive intermediate to come across the other coupling partner. This concept article summarizes recent state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances on radical&#8208;based convergent paired electrolysis, which adopted different strategies to overcome the difficulty.</dc:description>

         <title>Inversion of diaza[5]helicenes through an N&#8208;N bond breaking pathway</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,1&#8217;,10,10&#8217;&#8208;Biphenothiazine and its S,S,S&#8217;,S&#8217;&#8208;tetroxide are diaza[5]helicenes with N&#8208;N linkages. Kinetic experiments on racemization together with DFT calculations revealed that they undergo inversion through the N&#8208;N bond breaking pathway rather than the general conformational pathway. In these diaza[5]helicenes with this inversion mechanism, the reduction of electronic repulsion in the N&#8208;N bond by modification of S to SO2 at the outer position of the helix led to a significantly higher inversion barrier, 35.3 kcal/mol, compared to [5]helicene. 1,1&#8217;,10,10&#8217;&#8208;Biphenothiazine S,S,S&#8217;,S&#8217;&#8208;tetroxide was highly resistant to acid&#8208;mediated N&#8208;N bond breaking and racemization under acidic conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemically mediated toluene oxidation through a copper complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method is described to photochemically oxidize toluene selectively to benzaldehyde, an essential compound in the chemical industry. Copper(I) complexes with different ligands were applied in combination with [Ru(bipy)](PF6)2 and dioxygen as the oxidant. As a result, a "dioxygen adduct" copper complex, e. g. a peroxido complex, is formed as the active species. The copper(II) complex obtained after oxidation can be photochemically reduced to the starting copper(I) species, and the process can be repeated continuously. The ligand tris(2&#8208;methyl pyridyl)amine (tmpa) led to the highest conversion rates.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Five Tryptophan Isomers and Application of the Isomers to Solid&#8208;Phase Total Syntheses of Lysocin E Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tryptophan (Trp) plays a unique role in peptides and proteins as its indole ring possesses an electron&#8208;rich character and an N1&#8211;H hydrogen&#8208;bond donor. Because of its non&#8208;rotationally symmetric structure, synthetic alterations of the orientation of the indole ring would modulate the intrinsic structures and functions of peptides and proteins. Here we developed synthetic routes to the five Trp isomers in which the C3&#8208;substitution of the indole ring was changed to the C2/4/5/6/7&#8208;substitutions, and applied the five monomers to Fmoc&#8208;based solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. Specifically, the five monomers were prepared via Negishi cross&#8208;coupling reactions of C2/4/5/6/7&#8208;iodoindoles. To demonstrate the applicability of the monomers to the solid&#8208;phase synthesis, the five Trp isomers of macrocyclic antibiotic lysocin E were selected as target molecules and synthesized through peptide elongation, on&#8208;resin macrocyclization, and global deprotection. The Trp isomers displayed markedly weaker antibacterial activity than the parent natural product, revealing the biological importance of the precise three&#8208;dimensional shape of the original Trp residue of lysocin E. The present methods for the preparation and application of these five Trp isomers provide a new strategy for analyzing and modifying the specific functions of numerous Trp&#8208;containing peptides and proteins beyond this study.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Minisci Reaction with Diazines: An Approach Toward Original Fused Heterocycles.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we developed a photoinduced Minisci reaction on a large panel of diazines with good to excellent yields (28 examples, 44% to 89%). The reaction using 4CzIPN (1 mol%) as photoinitiator was carried out under white LED irradiation and required a slight excess of the acid reagent (1.2 equiv.). Cyclization reactions were then developed to access original N&#8208;heterocycles building blocks for drug discovery programs. An extension of the reaction to continuous flow was also reported. Finally, the mechanism of the transformation was studied suggesting a plausible radical chain mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolation, Structural and Physical Characterization as well as Reactivity of Persistent Acenium Radical Cation Salts.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unsubstituted acenium radical cations (ARCs) are extremely sensitive and were hitherto only studied in situ, i.e. in the gas phase, as dilute solutions in strong acids or by matrix isolation spectroscopy at about 10 K. In this study, we prepared, structurally, electro&#173;chemical&#173;ly and spectroscopically characterized room temperature stable ARC salts with the weakly coordi&#173;nating anion [F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; (ORF = &#8208;OC(CF3)3) supported by the weakly coordi&#173;nating sol&#173;vent 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene (TFB). Reaction of the neutral acenes with Ag+[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; led, non&#8208;innocent, to intermediate [Ag2(acene)2]2+ complexes, which decompose over time to Ag0 and the corresponding (impure) ARC salts. By contrast, direct deelectronation with the recently developed innocent deelectronator radical cation salt [anthraceneHal]+&#8729;[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; led to phase&#8208;pure products [acene]+&#8729;[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; (anthraceneHal = 9,10&#8208;dichlorooctafluoro&#173;anthracene; acene = anthra&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, pentacene). For the first time, a homogenous set of spectroscopic data on analytically pure ARC salts was obtained. In addition, cyclo&#173;voltammetric measure&#173;ments of the acenes connected the potentials in solution with those in the gas&#8208;phase. Hence, the data complement the existing isolated gas&#8208;phase, strong acid or matrix isolation studies. A first entry to follow&#8208;up chemistry of the acenium radical cations as ligand forming oxidizers was demonstrated by reaction with &#189; Co2(CO)8 giving [Co(anthracene)(CO)2]+.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrophilic Si&#8208;H Activation by Acetonitrilo Benzo[h]quinoline Iridacycles: Influence of Electronic Effects in Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The performance of six newly synthesized benzo[h]quinoline&#8208;derived acetonitrilo pentamethylcyclopentadienyl iridium(III) tetrakis(3,5&#8208;bis&#8208;trifluoromethylphenyl)borate salts bearing different substituents &#8208;X (&#8208;OMe, &#8208;H, &#8208;Cl, &#8208;Br, &#8208;NO2 and &#8211;(NO2)2) on the heterochelating ligand were evaluated in the dehydro&#8208;O&#8208;silylation of benzyl alcohol and the monohydrosilylation of 4&#8208;methoxybenzonitrile by Et3SiH, two reactions involving the electrophilic activation of the Si&#8208;H bond. The benchmark shows a direct dependence of the catalytic efficiency with the electronic effect of &#8208;X, which is confirmed by theoretical assessment of the intrinsic silylicities &#928; of hydridoiridium(III)&#8208;silylium adducts and by the theoretical evaluation of the propensity of hydridospecies to transfer the hydrido ligand to the activated substrate. The revisited analysis of the Ir&#8208;Si&#8208;H interactions shows that the most cohesive bond in hydridoiridium(III)&#8208;silylium adducts is the Ir&#8208;H one, while the Ir&#8208;Si is a weak donor&#8208;acceptor dative bond. The Si&#8230;H interaction in all the cases is noncovalent in nature and dominated by electrostatics confirming the heterolytic cleavage of the hydrosilane&#8217;s Si&#8208;H bond in this key catalytically relevant species.</dc:description>

         <title>Long&#8208;Lived Charge Separated States in Anthraquinone&#8208;Phenothiazine Dyads: Synthesis and Study of the Photophysical Property by Using Transient Optical and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In order to observe long&#8208;lived charge separated (CS) states in electron donor&#8208;acceptor dyads, herein we prepared a series of anthraquinone (AQ)&#8208;phenothiazine (PTZ) dyads, with adamantane as the linker. UV&#8208;vis absorption spectra show negligible electronic interaction between the AQ and PTZ units at ground state, yet charge transfer (CT) emission bands were observed. Nanosecond transient absorption shows that the 3AQ state is populated upon photoexcitation for AQ&#8208;PTZ in cyclohexane (CHX), but in acetonitrile (ACN), a 3CS state is formed. Similar results were observed for AQ&#8208;PTZ&#8208;M. The 3CS state lifetime of were determined as 0.52 &#956;s and 0.49 &#956;s, respectively. Upon oxidation of the PTZ unit, the 3AQ state was observed in both polar and non&#8208;polar solvents. For AQ&#8208;PTZ, femtosecond transient absorption spectra show fast formation of the 3AQ state in all solvents, with no charge separation in CHX, while formation of 3CS state takes 106 ps in ACN. For AQ&#8208;PTZ&#8208;M, a 3CS state is formed in CHX within 241 ps. Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectra show a radical ion pair with electron exchange energy of |2J| &#8805; 5.68 mT was observed for AQ&#8208;PTZ and AQ&#8208;PTZ&#8208;M, whereas in the dyads with PTZ unit oxidized, only the 3AQ state was observed.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct C&#8722;H Arylation of Dithiophene&#8208;Tetrathiafulvalene: Tuneable Electronic Properties and 2D Self&#8208;Assembled Molecular Networks at the Solid/Liquid Interface
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we report the direct C&#8722;H arylation of dithiophene&#8208;tetrathiafulvalene (DT&#8208;TTF) to synthesise mono&#8208; and tetraarylated derivatives functionalised with different groups. The self&#8208;assembly of DT&#8208;TTF&#8208;tetrabenzoic acid derivative was studied by using scanning tunnelling microscopy, which revealed the formation of ordered, densely packed 2D hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks at the graphite/liquid interface.







Abstract
Tetrathiafulvalene is among the best known building blocks in molecular electronics due to its outstanding electron&#8208;donating and redox properties. Among its derivatives, dithiophene&#8208;tetrathiafulvalene (DT&#8208;TTF) has attracted considerable interest in organic electronics, owing to its high field&#8208;effect mobility. Herein, we report the direct C&#8722;H arylation of DT&#8208;TTF to synthesise mono&#8208; and tetraarylated derivatives functionalised with electron&#8208;withdrawing and electron&#8208;donating groups in order to evaluate their influence on the electronic properties by cyclic voltammetry, UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. Self&#8208;assembly of the DT&#8208;TTF&#8208;tetrabenzoic acid derivative was studied by using scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) which revealed the formation of ordered, densely packed 2D hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks at the graphite/liquid interface. The tetrabenzoic acid derivative can attain a planar geometry on the graphite surface due to van der Waals interactions with the surface and H&#8208;bonding with neighbouring molecules. This study demonstrates a simple method for the synthesis of arylated DT&#8208;TTF derivatives towards the design and construction of novel &#960;&#8208;extended electroactive frameworks.

         <title>Intramolecular Hiyama Coupling: Synthesis of 1,8,13&#8208;Trisubstituted Chiral Triptycenes with Three Different Substituents by Intramolecular Substituent Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hiyama coupling via intramolecular substituent transfer from silicon on one blade of triptycenes to another yields 1,8,13&#8208;trisubstituted chiral triptycenes. This reaction is attributed to the proximity effect of substituents on triptycene, which plays an important role in not only the formation of the oxy&#8208;palladacycle but also the activation of the silyl group to facilitate &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis.







Abstract
Herein, we describe Hiyama coupling via intramolecular substituent transfer from silicon on one blade of triptycenes to another to yield 1,8,13&#8208;trisubstituted chiral triptycenes. This reaction is attributed to the proximity effect of substituents on triptycene, which plays an important role in not only the formation of the oxy&#8208;palladacycle but also the activation of the silyl group to facilitate &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis. After bromination and nucleophilic ring opening, the second intramolecular Hiyama coupling provided various 1,8,13&#8208;trisubstituted chiral triptycenes. The optical resolution of 1,8,13&#8208;triptycene afforded an optically active form for the first time.

         <title>In Vitro Selection and Characterization of a DNAzyme Probe for Diverse Pathogenic Strains of Clostridium difficile</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clostridium difficile frequently causes an infectious disease known worldwide as Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). An RNA&#8208;cleaving fluorogenic DNAzyme was selected that does not recognize other species of bacteria but can be sensitively activated by diverse clinical strains of C.&#8197;difficile. Such a synthetic DNAzyme can easily be incorporated into various biosensor designs to diagnose CDI.







Abstract
Clostridium difficile frequently causes an infectious disease known as Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), and there is an urgent need for the development of more effective rapid diagnostic tests for CDI. Previously we have developed an RNA&#8208;cleaving fluorogenic DNAzyme (RFD) probe, named RFD&#8208;CD1, that is capable of detecting a specific strain of C.&#8197;difficile but is too specific to recognize other pathogenic C.&#8197;difficile strains. To overcome this issue, herein we report RFD&#8208;CD2, another RFD that is not only highly specific to C.&#8197;difficile but also capable of recognizing diverse pathogenic C.&#8197;difficile strains. Extensive sequence and structure characterization establishes a pseudoknot structure and a significantly minimized sequence for RFD&#8208;CD2. As a fluorescent sensor, RFD&#8208;CD2 can detect C.&#8197;difficile at a concentration as low as 100&#8197;CFU/mL, thus making this DNAzyme an attractive molecular probe for rapid diagnosis of CDI caused by diverse strains of C.&#8197;difficile.

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Aromaticity of an Alternating Cyclo[4]Thiophene[4]Furan</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alternating furan&#8208;thiophene macrocycle has been synthesized without the need for stepwise buildup of oligomers. The ring is weakly antiaromatic due to the 4n&#8197;&#960; electrons along the outer annulene pathway of carbon atoms. The macrocycle can be made globally aromatic through chemical oxidation with SbCl5.







Abstract
A new class of conjugated macrocycle, the cyclo[4]thiophene[4]furan hexyl ester (C4TE4FE), is reported. This cycle consists of alternating &#945;&#8208;linked thiophene&#8208;3&#8208;ester and furan&#8208;3&#8208;ester repeat units, and was prepared in a single step using Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling of a 2&#8208;(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)furan monomer. The ester side groups help promote a syn conformation of the heterocycles, which enables formation of the macrocycle. Cyclic voltammetry studies revealed that C4TE4FE could undergo multiple oxidations, so treatment with SbCl5 resulted in formation of the [C4TE4FE]2+ dication. Computational work, paired with 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy of the dication, revealed that the cycle becomes globally aromatic upon 2e&#8722; oxidation, as the annulene pathway along the outer ring becomes H&#252;ckel aromatic. The change in ring current for the cycle upon oxidation was clear from 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy, as the protons of the thiophene and furan rings shifted downfield by nearly 6&#8197;ppm. This work highlights the potential of sequence control in furan&#8208;based macrocycles to tune electronic properties.

The change in ring current for the cycle upon oxidation was clear from &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy, as the protons of the thiophene and furan rings shifted downfield by nearly 6&#8197;ppm. This work highlights the potential of sequence control in furan-based macrocycles to tune electronic properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Supported Zinc Catalyst for the 1,2&#8208;Regioselective Hydroboration of N&#8208;Heteroarenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NHC&#8208;Zn complex with a fluorenyl sidearm catalyses the hydroboration of N&#8208;heteroarenes in highly 1,2&#8208;regioselective manner in addition to other routine substrates like carbonyl, ester, amide, and nitrile. A detailed computational analysis justifies the regioselectivity and also addresses the relative rate difference between different p&#8208;substituted pyridines. The computed pathway involves a molecular zinc hydride that is experimentally isolated and derivatized.







Abstract
A fluorenyl&#8208;tethered N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene LH (LH=[(Flu)H&#8722;(CH2)2&#8722;NHCDipp]) and its monoanionic version L&#8722; are explored in complexation with zinc towards the hydroboration of N&#8208;heteroarenes, carbonyl, ester, amide, and nitrile under ambient condition. The N&#8208;heteroarenes exhibit high 1,2&#8208;regioselectivity which is justified by computational analyses. The relative hydroboration rates of differently p&#8208;substituted (electron donating vs. withdrawing) pyridines are also addressed. The monodentate LH offers a better catalytic activity than the chelating L&#8722; for steric reasons despite both giving three&#8208;coordinate zinc complexes. The mechanism involves a Zn&#8722;H species at the heart of these catalytic processes which is trapped by Ph2CO. Computational studies suggest that the barrier to form the hydride complex is comparable to the barrier required for the following hydride transfer to pyridine.

         <title>Negative Homotropic Cooperativity in Guest Binding of a Trisporphyrin Double Cleft</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triple&#8208;layered trisporphyrin molecule possessing two cleft cavities showed negative homotropic cooperativity in the host&#8211;guest complex. When an electron&#8208;deficient guest molecule (yellow) was accommodated within one of the cleft cavities, the electronic structure of the porphyrin was altered, and the binding power of the remaining cavity was reduced. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Haino and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300107).

         <title>Harnessing Clickable Acylated Glycerol Probes as Chemical Tools for Tracking Glycerolipid Metabolism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clickable monoacylglycerol (MAG) analogs are used as probes to label glycerolipids during lipid metabolism. C4&#8208;MAG&#8208;N3, with a relatively short acyl chain, infiltrates natural lipid biosynthetic pathways to produce click&#8208;tagged versions of both neutral and phospholipid products. Strategic blocking of the glycerol sn&#8208;3 position in probe C4&#8208;MEG&#8208;N3 deactivates phospholipid tagging and focuses labeling on neutral lipids.







Abstract
We report the use of clickable monoacylglycerol (MAG) analogs as probes for the labeling of glycerolipids during lipid metabolism. Incorporation of azide tags onto the glycerol region was pursued to develop probes that would label glycerolipids, in which the click tag would not be removed through processes including acyl chain and headgroup remodeling. Analysis of clickable MAG probes containing acyl chains of different length resulted in widely variable cell imaging and cytotoxicity profiles. Based on these results, we focused on a probe bearing a short acyl chain (C4&#8208;MAG&#8208;N3) that was found to infiltrate natural lipid biosynthetic pathways to produce click&#8208;tagged versions of both neutral and phospholipid products. Alternatively, strategic blocking of the glycerol sn&#8208;3 position in probe C4&#8208;MEG&#8208;N3 served to deactivate phospholipid tagging and focus labeling on neutral lipids. This work shows that lipid metabolic labeling profiles can be tuned based on probe structures and provides valuable tools for evaluating alterations to lipid metabolism in cells.

         <title>Viscous, Hofmeister Effect&#8208;Enhanced Macromolecular Adhesives for Effective Bonding in Seawater</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Viscous, Hofmeister effect&#8208;enhanced macromolecular adhesives were synthesized via a facile one&#8208;step copolymerization. The Hofmeister effect effectively improve the adhesive performance of the polymeric adhesives in nature seawater.







Abstract
Deployment of adhesives in natural seawater to in&#8197;situ bonds is urgently needed in engineering fields. However, stable adhesion in natural seawater remains a challenge due to the turbulent environment and high ion concentration. Herein, we reported a viscous, macromolecular underwater adhesive enhanced by Hofmeister effect (EHUA) for practical application in dynamic seawater. EHUA was synthesized via a facile one&#8208;step copolymerization. After transferred into seawater, the solvent of EHUA was exchanged to seawater, and thereby hydrogen bonds inside the adhesive were activated and enhanced by Hofmeister effect. We demonstrated EHUA can adhere on the surface in turbulent seawater, and the adhesive strength could reach 1.691&#8197;MPa. In addition, the adhesives also exhibited long&#8208;term storage stability and convenient recyclability. These fascinating properties enable adhesives to seal leaky pipelines, repair damaged ships and construct buildings in turbulent seawater. This work may open an avenue for the design of adhesives for seawater environments.

         <title>Cationic Solution and Solid&#8208;State Emitters &#8211; Robust Imaging Agents for Cells, Bacteria, and Protists</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Be positive for imaging A series of luminescent cationic solution and solid&#8208;state emitters have been synthesized and applied for bioimaging purposes. In addition to low toxicity and facile synthesis, these emitters revealed striking uptake into biological samples such as human cells, bacteria as well as protists with high contrast during the fluorescence microscopy.







Abstract
A library of eight different cationic emitters with emission properties in solution and in solid&#8208;state (solution and solid&#8208;state emitters &#8211; SSSE) is presented. These compounds, bearing either ammonium or pyridinium groups, have been investigated regarding their photophysical properties as well as their potential application in biological imaging. Besides high quantum yields as well as a high degree of stability during the imaging process, it was additionally revealed that a broad range of biological targets can be addressed, such as different bacterial strains, human cells as well as protists. The reported SSSE approach employing the mentioned robust emitters for biological imaging, will contribute to a rapid and facile way to design and apply affordable emitters with outstanding properties. Additionally, these emitters will overcome the drawbacks of classical luminophores and agents featuring well&#8208;known aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) or aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) properties.

         <title>Bis[1]benzothieno[1,4]thiaborins as a Platform for BODIPY Singlet Oxygen Photosensitizers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the synthesis and physicochemical studies of two regioisomeric &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;extended [1,4]thiaborins annulated with two benzothiophene units. They were used as scaffolds to construct thiaborin&#8208;based BODIPY singlet&#8208;oxygen photosensitizers with evident potential for use as photocatalysts.







Abstract
A synthetic approach to two regioisomeric &#960;&#8208;electron extended [1,4]thiaborins annulated with two benzothiophene units has been developed. The central thiaborin rings of the boracycles obtained exhibit different electronic properties; this is reflected in their different aromatic characters, boron Lewis acidity and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopic behavior. Thiaborins were converted to boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) complexes. Their emission spectra exhibit two distinct bands resulting from 1LE and 1CT transitions. Strong near&#8208;infrared phosphorescence in Zeonex thin films at 77&#8197;K indicates efficient intersystem crossing and the formation of triplet states. Separation of HOMO and LUMO orbitals between boracyclic and BODIPY moieties facilitates electron transfer to a 1CT state followed by a transition to the 3LE triplet state located on the ligand. These unique properties of spiro thiaborin&#8208;BODIPY complexes were explored for their application as singlet&#8208;oxygen photosensitizers. They show excellent photocatalytic performance with singlet oxygen quantum yields reaching 77&#8201;% and full conversion of the model organic substrate achieved after 1.5&#8197;h with only 0.05&#8201;%&#8201;mol catalyst load.

         <title>Stretching the Bisalkyne Raman Spectral Palette Reveals a New Electrophilic Covalent Motif</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Raman bioorthogonal imaging: Varying the electronics of the aryl end&#8208;caps of bisaryl diynes (BADY) widened the palette for multiplexed Raman imaging. Electron&#8208;poor end&#8208;caps revealed the covalent reactivity of the aryl&#8208;capped diynes, opening new avenues for covalent Raman imaging.







Abstract
Small heteroaryl&#8208;diyne (Het&#8208;DY) tags with distinct vibrational frequencies, and physiologically relevant cLog P were designed for multiplexed bioorthogonal Raman imaging. Pd&#8722;Cu catalyzed coupling, combined with the use of Lei ligand, was shown to improve overall yields of the desired heterocoupled Het&#8208;DY tags, minimizing the production of homocoupled side&#8208;products. Spectral data were in agreement with the trends predicted by DFT calculations and systematic introduction of electron&#8208; rich/poor rings stretched the frequency limit of aryl&#8208;capped diynes (2209&#8211;2243&#8197;cm&#8722;1). The improved Log P of these Het&#8208;DY tags was evident from their diffuse distribution in cellular uptake studies and functionalizing tags with organelle markers allowed the acquisition of location&#8208;specific biological images. LC&#8211;MS&#8208; and NMR&#8208;based assays showed that some heteroaryl&#8208;capped internal alkynes are potential nucleophile traps with structure&#8208;dependent reactivity. These biocompatible Het&#8208;DY tags, equipped with covalent reactivity, open up new avenues for Raman bioorthogonal imaging.

         <title>Racemic Benzenesulfonohydrazide Enantioconvergent Tertiary C(sp3)&#8722;H Amination Catalyzed by Copper and Chiral Phosphoric Acid: Mechanistic Insights and Computational Prediction</title>

Mechanistic insights into enantioconvergent amination of racemic benzenesulfonohydrazide catalyzed by Cu and chiral phosphoric acid with computational prediction of various phosphoric acids as promising co&#8208;catalysts.







Abstract
Density functional theory computations reveal mechanistic insights into Cu and chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalyzed enantioconvergent amination of racemic benzenesulfonohydrazide. The O&#8722;O bond homolysis of tert&#8208;butyl 4&#8208;phenylbutaneperoxoate was found to be the turnover&#8208;limiting step with a total free energy barrier of 19.1&#8197;kcal/mol. The enantioconvergent amination is realized to obtain the same intermediate through prochiral carbon atom. The order and mode of hydrogen atom transferred by CPA and tert&#8208;butyloxy have a significant influence on the enantioselectivity and energy barriers. The olefinic side product generated by &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination is 9.9&#8197;kcal/mol thermodynamically less favourable. A series of phosphoric acids are predicted as promising co&#8208;catalysts with lower barriers for O&#8722;O bond homolysis.

         <title>Reversible Transition between Discrete and 1D Infinite Architectures: A Temperature&#8208;Responsive Cu(I) Complex with a Flexible Disilane&#8208;Bridged Bis(pyridine) Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermoresponsive molecular structure based on a disilane&#8208;bridged bis(pyridyl) ligand and CuI is reported. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis revealed that there were two polymorphs in the Cu(I) complex: octanuclear copper(I) complex at 20&#8201;&#176;C and 1D staircase copper(I) polymer complex at &#8722;173&#8201;&#176;C. The formation of these polymorphs is due to the flexibility of the disilane&#8208;bridged ligand.

Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis revealed that there are two polymorphs in the Cu(I) complex: octanuclear copper(I) complex at 20&#8201;&#176;C and 1D staircase copper(I) polymer complex at &#8722;173&#8201;&#176;C. The formation of these polymorphs is due to the flexibility of the ligand. Cu&#8722;I bond formation is observed upon cooling the sample from &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C to &#8722;170&#8201;&#176;C. The temperature&#8208;induced phase transition progression was clarified by DSC, VT&#8208;PXRD, and VT&#8208;photoluminescence measurements and indicated a reversible temperature&#8208;controlled crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal phase transition. Observation on a VT&#8208;stage using a high&#8208;speed camera showed crystal cracking during single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal transitions between these polymorphic forms.

         <title>X&#8208;ray Study of Cembranoids with Flexible Rings from Boswellia papyrifera Resins Allowing Structural Revision of Misleading Structures from the Past 70 Years</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boswellia papyrifera resins have had a long journey from 1500 BC. In 1966, the cembranoid skeleton become a part of the journey towards chemical investigations, and several cembranoids have been reported, but there is still uncertainty about their structure elucidation. In this study, we isolated 38 macrocyclic cembranoids from B. papyrifera resins, including six whose accepted structures needed to be revised. The study describes 25 single&#8208;crystal analyses, during which misleading factors in the stereochemistry determinations over the past 70 years were found. In addition, in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300559) Y.&#8208;X. Cheng and co&#8208;workers propose a biosynthetic pathway and briefly discuss SAR studies.
