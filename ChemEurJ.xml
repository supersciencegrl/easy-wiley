      <title>Solution&#8208;based, anion&#8208;doping of Li4Ti5O12 Nanoflowers 
for Lithium&#8208;ion Battery Applications</title>
      <dc:description>Solution&#8208;based, anionic doping represents a convenient strategy with which to improve upon the conductivity of candidate anode materials such as Li  4  Ti  5  O  12  (LTO). As such, we have primarily devised novel synthetic hydrothermally&#8208;inspired protocols, aimed at the large scale production of unique halogen&#8208;doped, micron&#8208;scale, three&#8208;dimensional, hierarchical LTO flower&#8208;like motifs. Though we have explored F doping, we have concentrated herein primarily on the use of Cl dopants. Several experimental variables, such as dopant amount, lithium hydroxide concentration, and titanium butoxide purity, were probed and perfected. Furthermore, the Cl doping process did not damage the intrinsic LTO morphology. Our analysis, based on interpreting a compilation of SEM, XRD, XPS, and TEM&#8208;EDS results, was used to determine an optimized dopant concentration of Cl. Electrochemical tests demonstrated an increased capacity via cycling of 12% for a doped sample as compared with pristine LTO. Moreover, the Cl&#8208;doped LTO sample described in this study exhibited the highest discharge capacity yet reported for this material at 120 mAh/g, obtained with an observed rate of 2C. Overall, these data suggest that the Cl dopant likely enhances not only the ion transport capabilities but also the overall electrical conductivity of our as&#8208;prepared structures. To help explain these favorable findings, theoretical DFT calculations were used to postulate that the electronic conductivity and Li diffusion were likely improved by partially reducing Ti  4+  to Ti  3+  and widening the Li migration channel.</dc:description>

      <title>Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Cationic Intermediates for the Synthesis of Chiral N,O&#8208;Acetals</title>
      <dc:description>Over a half century, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed homogeneous hydrogenation has been mainly focused on neutral and readily&#8208;prepared unsaturated substrates. While the addition of molecular hydrogen to C=C, C=N and C=O bonds was a well&#8208;studied paradigm, the asymmetric hydrogenation of cationic species was an underdeveloped area. In this research, we were seeking for a breakthrough in asymmetric hydrogenation to include cationic intermediates as the target and therefore expecting to apply this powerful tool in the construction of challenging chiral molecules. Under an acidic condition, both N &#8208; or O &#8208;acetyl salicylamides undergo cyclization to generate cationic intermediates, which was subsequentially reduced by an iridium or rhodium hydride complex. N,O &#8208;acetals were synthesized with remarkably high enantioselectivity. This catalytic strategy exhibited high efficiency (TON up to 4400) and high chemoselectivities. Mechanistic studies supported the hypothesis that a cationic intermediate was in situ formed and hydrogenated afterwards. A catalytic cycle was proposed with the hydride transfer from iridium complex to the cationic sp 2 &#8208;carbon being the rate determining step. A steric map of the catalyst was depicted to illustrate the chiral environment and a QSSR analysis showed how the enantiomeric induction was achieved in this chemical transformation.</dc:description>

      <title>Boron effect on sugar&#8208;based organogelators</title>

      <title>Total Synthesis of a Partial Structure from Arabinogalactan and its Application for Allergy&#8208;Prevention</title>
      <dc:description>Arabinogalactan, a microheterogeneous polysaccharide occurring in plants, is known for its allergy&#8208;protective activity, which could potentially be used for preventive allergy treatment. New treatment options are highly desirable, especially in a preventive manner, due to the constant rise of atopic diseases worldwide. The structural origin of the allergy&#8208;protective activity of arabinogalactan is, however, still unclear and isolation of the polysaccharide is not feasible for pharmaceutical applications due to a variation of the activity of the natural product and contaminations with endotoxins. Therefore, a pentasaccharide partial structure was selected for total synthesis and subsequently coupled to a carrier protein to form a neoglycoconjugate. The allergy&#8208;protective activity of arabinogalactan could be reproduced with the partial structure in subsequent in vivo experiments. This is the first example of a successful simplification of arabinogalactan with a single partial structure while retaining its allergy&#8208;preventive potential.</dc:description>

      <title>Enzymatic Insertion of Lipids Increases Membrane Tension for Inhibiting Cancer Cells</title>
      <dc:description>Although lipids contribute to cancer drug resistance, it is challenging to target diverse range of lipids. Here we show enzymatically inserting exceedingly simple synthetic lipids into membranes for increasing membrane tension and selectively inhibiting drug resistant cancer cells. The lipid, formed by conjugating dodecylamine to D&#8208;phosphotyrosine, self&#8208;assembles to form micelles. Enzymatic dephosphorylation of the micelles inserts the lipids into membranes and increases membrane tension. This transformation of micelles effectively inhibits a drug resistant glioblastoma cell (T98G) or a triple&#8208;negative breast cancer cell (HCC1937), without inducing acquired drug resistance. Moreover, the enzymatic reaction of the micelles promotes the accumulation of the lipids in the membranes of subcellular organelles (e.g., endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi, and mitochondria), thus activating multiple regulated cell death pathways. This work, as the first report that a multiple step molecular process increases membrane tension for inhibiting cancer cells, illustrates a new and powerful supramolecular approach for antagonizing difficult drug targets.</dc:description>

      <title>Triarylborane Appended Anils and Boranils: Solid State Emission, Mechanofluorochromism and Phosphorescence</title>
      <dc:description>Herein we report the design, synthesis, optical and mechanoluminescence properties of a series of conjugates having covalently linked triarylborane (TAB) and anils/boranils (TAB&#8208;anils:  1a  &#8208;  3a  and TAB&#8208;boranils:  1  &#8208;  3  ). The electronic interaction between TAB and anils/boranils in  1a  &#8208;  3a  and  1  &#8208;  3  were finetuned by changing the position of the boryl moiety on the phenyl spacer connecting TAB and anils/boranils units. Boryl moiety at the  meta  position (  1a  ) of the phenyl spacer stabilizes enolic form (E&#8208;OH) while boryl moiety at the  para  position (  2a  and  3a  ) stabilize keto form (Z&#8208;NH) in the solid state. However, in solutions state  1a  ,  2a  and  3a  exhibit keto&#8208;enol tautomerism in both ground and excited states.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Herein we report the design, synthesis, optical and mechanoluminescence properties of a series of conjugates having covalently linked triarylborane (TAB) and anils/boranils (TAB&#8208;anils:  1a  &#8208;  3a  and TAB&#8208;boranils:  1  &#8208;  3  ). The electronic interaction between TAB and anils/boranils in  1a  &#8208;  3a  and  1  &#8208;  3  were finetuned by changing the position of the boryl moiety on the phenyl spacer connecting TAB and anils/boranils units. Boryl moiety at the  meta  position (  1a  ) of the phenyl spacer stabilizes enolic form (E&#8208;OH) while boryl moiety at the  para  position (  2a  and  3a  ) stabilize keto form (Z&#8208;NH) in the solid state. However, in solutions state  1a  ,  2a  and  3a  exhibit keto&#8208;enol tautomerism in both ground and excited states. Both TAB coupled anils and boranils show red shifted absorption compared to the model compounds  4a  and  4,  devoid of TAB moiety indicating the effective participation of empty  p  &#8208;orbital on boron center. These compounds show vivid emission in solid&#8208;state and the luminescence color tunability was realized.

      <title>Syntheses of Salmonella Paratyphi A associated oligosaccharide antigens and development towards anti&#8208;paratyphoid fever vaccines</title>

Currently there are no approved vaccines against  Salmonella  Paratyphi A, the leading cause of paratyphoid fever. To fill this gap, oligosaccharides corresponding to the  O  &#8208;polysaccharide repeating units from the surface of  Salmonella  Paratyphi A have been synthesized through convergent stereoselective glycosylations.

The availability of well&#8208;defined glycan antigen enabled the determination that one repeating unit of the polysaccharide is sufficient to induce protective antibodies, and the paratose residue and/or the  O  &#8208;acetyl modifications on the backbone are important for recognition by antibodies elicited by a Q&#946;&#8208;tetrasaccharide conjugate.

      <title>Bivariate metal&#8208;organic frameworks with tunable spin&#8208;crossover properties</title>
      <dc:description>In this work, we have screened out pyrazine (A), aminopyrazine (B), quinoxaline (C), and 5,6,7,8&#8208;tetrahydroquinoxaline (D) among a large number of pyrazine derivatives to construct Hofmann&#8208;type MOFs Fe(L)[M(CN)4] (M = Pt, Pd) with similar 3D pillared&#8208;layer structures. X&#8208;ray single crystal diffraction reveals that the alternate linkage between M and Fe(II) ions through cyano bridges forms the 2D extended metal cyanide sheets, and ligands  A&#8208;D  acted as vertical columns to connnect 2D sheets to give 3D pillared&#8208;layer structures. Subsequently, a series of bivariate MOFs were constructed by pairwise combination of the four ligands  A&#8208;D  , which were confirmed by  1  H NMR, PXRD, FT&#8208;IR and Raman. The results demonstrated that ligand size and crystallization velocity play a dominant role in constructing bivariate Hofmann&#8208;type MOFs. More importantly, the SCO properties of the bivariate MOFs can be finely tuned by adjusting the proportion of two pillared ligands in the 3D Hofmann&#8208;type structures. Remarkably, the spin transition temperatures,  Tc  &#8593; and  Tc  &#8595; of the Fe(  A)x(B)1&#8208;x  [Pt(CN)4] (x = 0&#8208;1) can be adjusted from 239 to 254 K and 248 K to 284 K, respectively.

Changing Pt to Pd, the hysteresis loops of Fe(A)x(B)1&#8208;x  [Pd(CN)  4] can be tuned from 9 K (T&#160;c  &#8593; = 215 K,  Tc  &#8595; = 206 K) to 24 K ( Tc  &#8593; = 300 K,  Tc  &#8595; = 276 K).

      <title>Synthesis of Oligonucleotides containing the cis&#8208;Interstrand Crosslink Produced by Mitomycins in their Reaction with DNA.</title>
      <dc:description>Mitomycin C, (MC), an antitumor drug and decarbamoylmitomycin C, (DMC), a derivative of MC lacking the carbamoyl moiety, are DNA alkylating agents which can form DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) between deoxyguanosine residues located on opposing DNA strands. MC forms primarily deoxyguanosine adducts with a 1&#8221;&#8208; R stereochemistry at the guanine&#8208;mitosene bond (1&#8221;&#8208;&#945;, trans ) whereas DMC forms mainly adducts with a 1&#8221;&#8208; S stereochemistry (1&#8221;&#8208;&#946;, cis ). The crosslinking reaction is diastereospecific: trans &#8208;crosslinks are formed exclusively at CpG sequences, while cis &#8208;crosslinks are formed only at GpC sequences. Until now, oligonucleotides containing 1&#8221;&#8208;&#946;&#8208;deoxyguanosine adducts or ICL at a specific site could not be synthesized, thus limiting the investigation of the role played by the stereochemical configuration at C1'' in the toxicity of these compounds. Here, we present a novel biomimetic synthesis to access these substrates. Structural proof of the adducted oligonucleotides and ICL were provided by enzymatic digestion to nucleosides, high resolution mass spectral analysis, CD spectroscopy and UV melting temperature studies. Finally, a virtual model of the 25 mer 1&#8221;&#8208;&#946; ICL synthesized was created to explore the conformational space and structural features of the crosslinked duplex.</dc:description>

      <title>Amine Catalysis with Substrates Bearing N&#8208;Heterocyclic Moieties&#160;Enabled by Control over the Enamine Pyramidalization Direction</title>
      <dc:description>Stereoselective organocatalytic&#160;C&#8211;C bond formations that tolerate N&#8208;heterocycles are valuable since these moieties are common motifs in numerous chiral bioactive compounds. Such transformations are, however, challenging since N&#8208;heterocyclic moieties can interfere with the catalytic reaction. Here, we present a peptide that catalyzes conjugate addition reactions between aldehydes and&#160;nitroolefins bearing a broad range of different N&#8208;heterocyclic moieties with basic and/or H&#8208;bonding sites&#160;in excellent yields and stereoselectivities. Tuning of the pyramidalization direction of the enamine intermediate enabled the high stereoselectivity.</dc:description>

      <title>Building Hierarchical Microcubes Composed of One&#8208;Dimensional CoSe2@Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon for Superior Sodium Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Designing and synthesizing well&#8208;tolerated anode materials accompanied with high capacity is a critical foundation for the practical application of sodium ion batteries (SIBs), however, which remains an insurmountable barrier. The introduction regarding hierarchical architecture and carbon support is an effective strategy for addressing challenges. Thus, we fabricated hierarchical CoSe  2  @nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (CoSe  2  @NC) microcubes composite using Prussian blue analogs Co  3  [Co(CN)  6  ]  2  as a template. The rational combination of unique construction from one dimension (1D) to three dimensions (3D) and nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon skeleton facilitates sodium&#8208;ion and electron transport and stabilizes the host structure during repeated discharge/charge process, which contributes overwhelming capability to sodium storage. As expected, the as&#8208;prepared CoSe  2  @NC composite delivers remarkable reversible capacity and ultralong cycling lifespan even at a high rate (384.3 mAh g  &#8208;1  after1800 loops under 2.0 A g  &#8208;1  ) when served as anode for SIBs. This work provides great possibilities for the practical application of CoSe  2  &#8208;based anode in SIBs and the original strategy can be extended to explore other anode materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Formation of highly ordered molecular porous 2D networks from cyano&#8208;functionalized porphyrins on Cu(111)</title>
      <dc:description>We investigated the adsorption of three related cyano&#8208;functionalized tetraphenyl porphyrin derivatives on Cu(111) by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in ultra&#8208;high vacuum (UHV) with the goal to identify the role of the cyano group and the central Cu atom for the intermolecular and supramolecular arrangement. The porphyrin derivatives studied were Cu&#8208;TCNPP, Cu&#8208;cisDCNPP, and 2H&#8208;cisDCNPP, that is, Cu&#8208;5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis&#8208;(p&#8208;cyano)&#8208;phenyl&#8208;porphyrin, Cu&#8208;meso&#8208;cis&#8208;di(p&#8208;cyano)&#8208;phenyl&#8208;porphyrin and 2H&#8208;meso&#8208;cis&#8208;di(p&#8208;cyano)&#8208;phenyl&#8208;porphyrin, respectively. Starting from different structures obtained after deposition at room temperature, all three molecules form the same long&#8208;range ordered hexagonal honeycomb&#8208;type structure with triangular pores and three molecules per unit cell. For the metal&#8208;free 2H&#8208;cisDCNPP, this occurs only after self&#8208;metalation upon heating. The structure&#8208;forming elements are pores with a distance of 3.1 nm, formed by triangles of porphyrins fused together by cyano&#8208;Cu&#8208;cyano interactions with Cu adatoms. This finding leads us to suggest that two cyano&#8208;phenyl groups in the &#8220;cis&#8221; position is the minimum prerequisite to form a highly ordered 2D porous molecular pattern. The experimental findings are supported by detailed density functional theory calculations to analyze the driving forces that lead to the formation of the porous hexagonal honeycomb&#8208;type structure.</dc:description>

      <title>Title Amino Acid Modified RNA Bases as Building Blocks of an Early Earth RNA&#8208;Peptide World</title>

Therefore, to develop the strain sensor hydrogels that possess both good mechanical properties and self&#8208;adhesion is still a great challenge.

      <dc:description>
The kinetics of photoinduced reactions of fluorescent molecules can be observed by laser flash photolysis techniques. Considering that those techniques require substantial amounts of samples the use for analytical or diagnostic application is limited. The photophysics of a fluorescent molecule can be accessed by monitoring the kinetics of the fluctuation of fluorescence, which is called blinking. This methods can be used to gain microenvironmental information around a fluorescent molecule, by using a method named kinetic analysis based on the control of fluorescence blinking (KACB).

      <dc:description>
In P2&#8208;type layered transition&#8208;metal oxides, high capacity requires more Na ions to join in the transition as the capacity is generated by their transition. But if too much Na+ ions move out, the structure would be broken. Achieving the balance between high capacity and well stability is the main point. Problems (e.g., structure evolution and anionic redox) of such cathodes and improving strategies including composition regulation, surface coating, and nano&#8208;structuring to tune phase composition, structure and electrochemical reaction are summarized in the Review of S.

In this work, hexagonal La  2  O  3  nanocrystals on a nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbon (NPC) derived from crop radish, served as building bricks, are prepared by chemical precipitation and then calcination at elevated temperatures. The obtained La  2  O  3  /NPC hybrid exhibits a very high ORR activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.90 V, exceeding that of commercial Pt/C (0.83 V). Both DFT theoretical and experimental results have verified that the significantly enhanced catalytic performance is ascribed to the formation of the C&#8208;O&#8208;La covalent bonds between carbon and La  2  O  3  . Through the covalent bonds, electrons can transfer from the carbon to La  2  O  3  and occupy the unfilled e  g  orbital of La  2  O  3  phase. It results in the accelerated adsorption of active oxygen and the facilitated desorption of the surface hydroxides (OH  ad  &#8208;  ), thereby promoting the ORR over the catalyst.</dc:description>

      <title>Intermacrocyclic Interaction Upon Stepwise Oxidations in a Monometallic Porphyrin Dimer: Ring versus Metal&#8208;centre Oxidations and Effect of Counter Anions</title>
      <dc:description>The effect of intermacrocylic interaction was studied by controlled and step&#8208;wise oxidations of monometallic silver(II) porphyrin dimer that contains a highly flexible ethane bridge. Monometallic dimers are unique systems and behave differently from their dimetallic analog on the basis of their available sites for storing oxidizing equivalents. UV&#8208;visible,  1  H NMR, XPS and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies clearly suggest the removal of first electron from the metal centre. The removal of second electron occurred from the ring&#8208;center to form a &#960;&#8208;cation radical and, thereby, form a very unique mixed&#8208;valent species. However, unlike in all other ethane&#8208;bridged metalloporphyrin dimer reported earlier, the 2e&#8208;oxidized species showed quite unusual structures depending on the nature of counter ions. Ions like SbF  6  , SbCl  6  and PF  6  are engaged in strong interaction with porphyrin &#960;&#8208;cation radical and causes substantial structural change including large deformation of the ring. The solid state structure remains intact in solution also. The observations are further supported by the DFT calculations.</dc:description>

      <title>Phenol oxidation by a nickel(III)&#8208;fluoride complex: exploring the influence of the proton accepting ligand in PCET oxidation</title>
      <dc:description>In order to gain insight into the influence of the H  +  &#8208;accepting terminal ligand in high&#8208;valent oxidant mediated proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions, the reactivity of a high valent nickel&#8208;fluoride complex [Ni  III  (F)(L)] (  2  , L = N,N&#8217;&#8208;(2,6&#8208;dimethylphenyl)&#8208;2,6&#8208;pyridinecarboxamidate) with substituted phenols was explored. Analysis of kinetic data from these reactions (Evans&#8208;Polanyi, Hammett, and Marcus plots, and KIE measurements) and the formed products show that  2  reacted with electron rich phenols through a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT, or concerted PCET) mechanism and with electron poor phenols via a stepwise PT/ET reaction mechanism. The analogous complexes [Ni  III  (Z)(L)] (Z = Cl, OCO  2  H, O  2  CCH  3  , ONO  2  ) reacted with all phenols through a HAT mechanism. We explore the reason for a change in mechanism with the highly basic fluoride ligand in  2. 2  was also found to react one to two orders magnitude faster than the corresponding analogous [Ni  III  (Z)(L)] complexes. This was ascribed to a high bond dissociation free energy value associated with H&#8211;F (135 kcal/mol), which is the product formed from PCET oxidation by  2  and is believed to be the driving force for the reaction. Our findings show that high&#8208;valent metal&#8208;fluoride complexes represent a class of highly reactive PCET oxidants.</dc:description>

New topology of polyoxovanadates: A rare example of lacunary Keggin&#8208;type vanadoselenite [SeV10O28(SeO3)3]8&#8722; ({Se4V10}) was readily obtained, which shows sufficient reactivity with divalent transition metals (TMs) to form a new series of TM&#8208;sandwiched complexes {(Se4V10)2M} (M=Mn, Co, Zn). Such new TM&#8208;derivatives can efficiently catalysis heterogeneous oxidation of sulfides in high conversion and selectivity under mild conditions.

      <dc:description>
Organic electrosynthesis guides the way to alkyl arylsulfonates! In an electrochemical multi&#8208;component reaction, an alcohol of choice, an electron&#8208;rich arene, and SO2 are converted to alkyl arylsulfonates. This novel methodology features the first direct synthesis of alkyl arylsulfonates from arenes at mild reaction conditions. No prefunctionalization is required and no DABSO is needed.

      <title>Anthranoxides as Highly Reactive Arynophiles for the Synthesis of Triptycenes</title>
      <dc:description>
An efficient method to synthesize triptycenes through the reaction of benzynes and anthranoxides, which are electron&#8208;rich and readily prepared from the corresponding anthrones, is reported. Using this method, 1,9&#8208;syn&#8208;substituted triptycenes were regioselectively obtained employing 3&#8208;methoxybenzynes. This method was also applied to synthesize pentiptycenes. A DFT study revealed that the cycloaddition of lithium anthranoxide and benzyne proceeds stepwise. More information can be found in the Communication by T. Iwata, M. Shindo, et&#8197;al.

The carbaporphyrinoid rollercoaster: Diphenanthrioctaphyrin(1.1.1.0.1.1.1.0) exists as two locked figure&#8208;eight isomers that demonstrate multiple conformational rearrangements and anion&#8208;binding events upon protonation.

Mixed&#8208;metal selenide anode material: Carbon&#8208;coated porous Ni&#8208;doped CoSe2 (Ni&#8208;CoSe2/C) nanospheres have been fabricated by a facile hydrothermal method followed by a new selenization strategy.

Abstract
Carbon&#8208;layer&#8208;coated porous Ni&#8208;doped CoSe2 (Ni&#8208;CoSe2/C) nanospheres have been fabricated by a facile hydrothermal method followed by a new selenization strategy. The porous structure of Ni&#8208;CoSe2/C is formed by the aggregation of many small particles (20&#8211;40&#8197;nm), which are not tightly packed together, but are interspersed with gaps. Moreover, the surfaces of these small particles are covered with a thin carbon layer. Ni&#8208;CoSe2/C delivers superior rate performance (314.0&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), ultra&#8208;long cycle life (316.1&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 8000&#8197;cycles), and excellent full&#8208;cell performance (208.3&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 70&#8197;cycles) when used as an anode material for half/full sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The Na storage mechanism and kinetics have been confirmed by ex situ X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, assessment of capacitance performance, and a galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT). GITT shows that Na+ diffusion in the electrode material is a dynamic change process, which is associated with a phase transition during charge and discharge. The excellent electrochemical performance suggests that the porous Ni&#8208;CoSe2/C nanospheres have great potential to serve as an electrode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

Ni&#8208;CoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C delivers superior rate performance (314.0&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), ultra&#8208;long cycle life (316.1&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 8000&#8197;cycles), and excellent full&#8208;cell performance (208.3&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 70&#8197;cycles) when used as an anode material for half/full sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The Na storage mechanism and kinetics have been confirmed by ex situ X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, assessment of capacitance performance, and a galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT). GITT shows that Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion in the electrode material is a dynamic change process, which is associated with a phase transition during charge and discharge. The excellent electrochemical performance suggests that the porous Ni&#8208;CoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C nanospheres have great potential to serve as an electrode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

      <dc:description>
The direction of hole transfer (unpaired spin) in the DNA&#8208;component, occurring between base and modified phosphate, is depicted in the cover artwork. This process critically determines the DNA&#8208;backbone damage. In one&#8208;electron oxidized phosphorodithioate nucleotide, the hole is initially localized on guanine base as a cation radical (Gua.+). Next, via base&#8208;to&#8208;backbone hole transfer, the hole appears on phosphorodithioate as dithiyl radical. Cover art designed by Ariela Kaspi&#8208;Kaneti, with contribution from Aditya Paul.

      <title>Tuning the Triplet Excited State of Bis(dipyrrin) Zinc(II) Complexes: Symmetry Breaking Charge Transfer Architecture with Exceptionally Long Lived Triplet State for Upconversion</title>
      <dc:description>Zinc(II) bis(dipyrrin) complexes, which feature intense visible absorption and efficient symmetry breaking charge transfer (SBCT) are outstanding candidates for photovoltaics but their short lived triplet states limit applications in several areas. Herein we demonstrate that triplet excited state dynamics of bis(dipyrrin) complexes can be efficiently tuned by attaching electron donating aryl moieties at the 5,5'&#8208;position of the complexes. For the first time, a long lived triplet excited state (&#964; T = 296 &#181;s) along with efficient ISC ability (&#934; &#8710; = 71%) was observed for zinc(II) bis(dipyrrin) complexes, formed via SBCT process. The results revealed that molecular geometry and energy gap between CT state and triplet energy levels strongly controls the triplet excited state properties of the complexes. An efficient triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion system was devised for the first time using SBCT architecture as triplet photosensitizer, reaching a high upconversion quantum yield of 6.2%. Our findings provide a blueprint for the development of triplet photosensitizers based on earth abundant metal complexes with long lived triplet state for revolutionary photochemical applications.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chiral secondary alkylcopper reagents were prepared from the corresponding alkyl iodides with retention of configuration via an I/Li&#8208;exchange using  t  &#8208;BuLi (&#8211;100 &#176;C, 1 min) followed by a transmetalation with CuBr&#183;P(OEt)  3  (&#8211;100 &#176;C, 20 s). These stereodefined secondary alkylcoppers underwent stereoretentive cross&#8208;couplings with several 3&#8208;iodo or 3&#8208;bromo unsaturated carbonyl derivatives leading to the corresponding &#947;&#8208;methylated Michael acceptors in good yields and with high diastereoselectivities (dr up to 96:4). The method was extended to enantiomerically enriched alkylcoppers, providing optically enriched advanced natural product intermediates with up to 90%  ee  .&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A &#8216;Thermodynamically Stable&#8217; 2D Ni&#8208;MOF over a Wide pH Range with Scalable Preparation for Efficient C2s over C1 Hydrocarbon Separations</title>
      <dc:description>Design and construction of &#8216;thermodynamically stable&#8217; MOFs surviving in liquid water, boiling water, acidic/basic solutions over a wide pH range is highly desirable for many practical applications especially adsorption based gas separations with obvious scalable preparations.

As an alternate to cost intensive cryogenic high pressure distillation process for the separation of hydrocarbons, recently MOFs have shown the promise of such separation. Thus, towards application standpoint, this MOF exhibits relatively higher uptake of C  2  s hydrocarbons over the C  1  hydrocarbon at ambient conditions with one of the highest selectivities based on IAST method. Combination of two strategies (presence of stronger metal&#8208;N coordination on the spacer and the hydrophobicity on the aromatic moiety of the organic ligand) possibly makes the framework highly robust even stable in boiling water and over a wide range of pH 2&#8208;10 and representing the first example of &#8216;thermodynamically stable&#8217; MOF displaying 2D structural network. Moreover, this material is easily scalable by refluxing the reaction mixture overnight. Because, such separations are performed in presence of water vapor and acidic gases, there is a great need to explore &#8216;thermodynamically stable&#8217; MOFs retaining not only the structural integrity but also the porosity of frameworks.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of a Molecule with Five Different Adjacent Pnictogens</title>
      <dc:description>
Power of 5! A molecular compound with all five pnictogen atoms and exclusively tertiary butyl substituents was obtained by a planned multi&#8208;step synthesis (see figure).







Abstract
The first molecular compound with all five pnictogens was obtained by a multi&#8208;step reaction. Lithiation of the (bisamido)diazadiarsetidine (tBuNAs)2(tBuNH)2 in aliphatic solvents leads to the dimeric metallated species [(tBuNAs)2(tBuNLi)2]2 (12). Upon reactions with AsCl3, SbCl3 and BiCl3 the polycyclic compounds [(tBuNAs)2(tBuN)2]PnCl (Pn=As (2), Sb (3), Bi (4)) can be obtained. Conversion of 2&#8211;4 with [tBu2SbP(tBu)Li(OEt2)]2 leads to the remarkable interpnictogens [(tBuNAs)2(tBuN)2]PnP(tBu)SbtBu2 (Pn=As (5), Sb (6), Bi (7)), whereby 7 is the first example of a molecule containing all five Group&#8197;15 elements. The compound with adjacent AsNBiPSb&#8208;chains is surprisingly stable and does not show high sensibility against light as the labile Bi&#8722;P bond might suggest.

      <title>JoyaPhos: An Atropisomeric Teraryl Monophosphine Ligand</title>
      <dc:description>
JoyaPhos: A new atropisomeric monophosphine (JoyaPhos) was prepared by the sequential de novo introduction of aromatic units, resulting in a configurationally stable teraryl structure with a well&#8208;defined topology. The ligand scaffold differs from canonical binaphthyl structures and can accommodate transition metals in a dense ligand sphere, suitable for stereoselective transformations.







Abstract
A topologically well&#8208;defined atropisomeric teraryl monophosphine ligand system, prepared by a highly stereoselective arene&#8208;forming aldol condensation combined with a direct ester&#8208;to&#8208;anthracene transformation, is described herein. The ligands were evaluated for gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed [2+2] cycloaddition and cycloisomerization reactions as well as a unique intramolecular Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling for the atroposelective synthesis of a N&#8208;aryl&#8208;indoline bearing a C&#8722;N stereogenic axis. The ligand structure induced up to 95:5 stereoselectivity in the asymmetric allylic alkylation reaction and features an interesting dynamic behavior as observed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies.

      <title>PAINT&#8208;ing Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc)&#8208;Diphenylalanine Hydrogels</title>
      <dc:description>
Key aspects of hydrogels like fiber diameter, network morphology and mesh size are sub&#8208;diffraction limited features and cannot be visualized effectively using confocal microscopy. In this work, we show that it is possible to image fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl&#8208;protected diphenylalanine (FmocFF) hydrogels by points accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography (PAINT) in native conditions and without direct gel labelling (see figure).







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl&#8208;protected diphenylalanine (FmocFF) in water is widely known to produce hydrogels. Typically, confocal microscopy is used to visualize such hydrogels under wet conditions, that is, without freezing or drying. However, key aspects of hydrogels like fiber diameter, network morphology and mesh size are sub&#8208;diffraction limited features and cannot be visualized effectively using this approach. In this work, we show that it is possible to image FmocFF hydrogels by Points Accumulation for Imaging in Nanoscale Topography (PAINT) in native conditions and without direct gel labelling. We demonstrate that the fiber network can be visualized with improved resolution (&#8776;50&#8197;nm) both in 2D and 3D. Quantitative information is extracted such as mesh size and fiber diameter. This method can complement the existing characterization tools for hydrogels and provide useful information supporting the design of new materials.

      <title>Dynamic Coordination Chemistry of Fluorinated Zr&#8208;MOFs: Synthetic Control and Reassembly/Disassembly beyond de novo Synthesis to Tune the Structure and Property</title>
      <dc:description>
Zr4+ metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Zr&#8208;MOFs), known for excellent stability and functionality, meet the synthetic challenge in tuning the strength of a Zr&#8722;Ocarboxylate linkage. This work explores the unusual coordination dynamics of a family of fluorinated Zr&#8208;MOFs. The low&#8208;connecting kinetic Zr&#8208;MOFs possess dynamic behavior, thus opening a post&#8208;synthetic pathway to sequential reassembly/disassembly. The factors, such as ligand geometry, etc., have been studied. Their stability, hydrophobicity and gas adsorption/separation properties are explored. More information can be found in the Full Paper by Z.&#8208;W. Wei, G. Maurin, C.&#8208;Y. Su, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202001052).

Garlic, Allium Sativum, is native to Central Asia and is grown in China in extraordinary amounts, accounting for 80&#8201;% of the world's total production. Famous for its pungent odor and characteristic flavor, beneath its cloves are natural products with well&#8208;known biological properties.

A hydrothermal reaction taking place in a capillary while being monitored using in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction from a synchrotron source is depicted in the cover image. The capillary is locally heated from above, while being penetrated by X&#8208;rays, which are diffracted in cone&#8208;like patterns by the powder within.

      <title>Ni[B2(SO4)4] and Co[B2(SO4)4]: Unveiling systematic trends in phyllosilicate analogue borosulfates</title>
      <dc:description>Borosulfates are compounds analogous to silicates, with heteropolyanionic subunits of vertex&#8208;linked (SO  4  )&#8208; and (BO  4  )&#8208;tetrahedra. In contrast to the immense structural diversity of silicates, the number of borosulfates is yet very limited and the extent of their properties is still unknown. This is particularly true for representatives with phyllosilicate and tectosilicate analogue anionic substructures. Herein, we present Ni[B  2  (SO  4  )  4  ] and Co[B  2  (SO  4  )  4  ], two new borosulfates with phyllosilicate analogue topology. While the anionic subunits of both structures are homeotypic, the positions of the charge compensating cations differ significantly: Ni  II  is located between the borosulfate layers, while Co  II  in contrast is embedded within the layer. Detailed analysis of these two structures based on single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, magnetochemical investigations, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and quantum chemical calculations, unveiled the reasons for this finding. By  in silico  comparison with other divalent borosulfates, we uncovered systematic trends for phyllosilicate analogues leading to the prediction of new species.</dc:description>

      <title>O6&#8208;Alkylguanine DNA Alkyltransferase Mediated Disassembly of a DNA Tetrahedron</title>
      <dc:description>Tetrahedron DNA structures were formed by the assembly of three&#8208;way junction (TWJ) oligonucleotides containing  O6&#8208;2'&#8208;deoxyguanosine&#8208;alkylene&#8208;O6&#8208;2'&#8208;deoxyguanosine (butylene and heptylene linked) intrastrand cross&#8208;links (IaCLs) lacking a phosphodiester group between the 2'&#8208;deoxyribose residues. The DNA tetrahedra containing  TWJs were shown to undergo an unhooking reaction by the human DNA repair protein  O6&#8208;alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (hAGT) resulting in structure disassembly. The unhooking reaction of hAGT towards the DNA tetrahedra was observed to be moderate to virtually complete depending on the protein equivalents. DNA tetrahedron structures have been explored as drug delivery platforms that release their payload in response to triggers such as light, chemical agents or hybridization of release strands. The dismantling of DNA tetrahedron structures by a DNA repair protein contributes to the armamentarium of approaches for drug release employing DNA nanostructures.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tetrahedron DNA structures were formed by the assembly of three&#8208;way junction (TWJ) oligonucleotides containing  O6&#8208;2'&#8208;deoxyguanosine&#8208;alkylene&#8208;O6&#8208;2'&#8208;deoxyguanosine (butylene and heptylene linked) intrastrand cross&#8208;links (IaCLs) lacking a phosphodiester group between the 2'&#8208;deoxyribose residues. The DNA tetrahedra containing  TWJs were shown to undergo an unhooking reaction by the human DNA repair protein  O6&#8208;alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (hAGT) resulting in structure disassembly. The unhooking reaction of hAGT towards the DNA tetrahedra was observed to be moderate to virtually complete depending on the protein equivalents. DNA tetrahedron structures have been explored as drug delivery platforms that release their payload in response to triggers such as light, chemical agents or hybridization of release strands. The dismantling of DNA tetrahedron structures by a DNA repair protein contributes to the armamentarium of approaches for drug release employing DNA nanostructures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>36&#8208;nuclearity Organophosphonate&#8208;functionalized polyoxomolybdates: Synthesis, Characterization and Selective catalytic oxidation of sulfides</title>
      <dc:description>The crown&#8208;shaped 36&#8208;molybdate cluster organophosphonate&#8208;functionalized polyoxomolybdates with the highest nuclearity in organophosphonate&#8208;based polyoxometalates chemistry,  (NH  4  )  19  Na  7  H  10  [Cu(H  2  O)TeMo  6  O  21  {N(CH  2  PO  3  )  3  }]  6  &#183;31H  2  O  , has been reported for the first time. The synthesized 36&#8208;molybdate cluster was characterized by routine techniques and employed as a catalyst for selective oxidation of sulfides with impressive catalytic and selective performances under heat treatment. High efficiency (TON=15333) was achieved in the selective oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides, caused by the synergic effect between copper and polyoxomolybdates and the generation of the cuprous species during the heat treatment.</dc:description>

      <title>Carbene&#8208;induced rescue of catalytic activity in deactivated Nitrite Reductase mutant</title>
      <dc:description>The role of His145 in the T1 copper center of Nitrite Reductase (NiR) is pivotal for the activity of the enzyme. Mutation to a glycine at this position enables the reconstitution of the T1 center by the addition of imidazole as exogenous ligands, however the catalytic activity is only marginally rescued. Here we demonstrate that the uptake of 1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazolylidene as N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) by the H145G NiR mutant instead of imidazole yields a significantly more active catalyst, suggesting a beneficial role of such C&#8208;bonding. Spectroscopic analyses of the formed H145G~NHC variant as well as an analogue without the catalytic T2 copper center reveals no significant alteration of the T1 site compared to the wild type or the variant containing imidazole as exogenous N&#8208;bound surrogate of H145. However, the presence of the carbene doubles the catalytic activity of the mutant compared to the imidazole variant. This enhanced activity has been attributed to a faster electron transfer to the T1 center in the NHC variant and a concomitant change of the rate&#8208;limiting step.</dc:description>

      <title>Activation of Ethylene by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Coordinated Magnesium(I) Compounds</title>
      <dc:description>Reactions of a series of magnesium(I) compounds with ethylene, in the presence of an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, have been explored. Treating [{(MesNacnac)Mg}2] (MesNacnac = [HC(MeCNMes)2]&#8208;, Mes = mesityl) with an excess of ethylene in the presence of two equivalents of:C{(MeNCMe)2} (TMC) leads to the formal reductive coupling of ethylene, and formation of the 1,2&#8208;dimagnesiobutane complex, [{(MesNacnac)(TMC)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;C4H8)]. In contrast, when the reaction is repeated in the presence of three equivalents of TMC, a mixture of the &#946;&#8208;diketiminato magnesium ethyl, [(MesNacnac)(TMC)MgEt], and the NHC coordinated magnesium diamide, [(MesNacnac&#8208;H)Mg(TMC)2], results.

      <title>Luminescent Bimetallic Ir(III)/Au(I) Peptide Bioconjugates as Potential Theranostic Agents</title>
      <dc:description>Diverse&#160;iridium peptide bioconjugates and the iridium/gold bimetallic complexes have been synthesised starting from the Ir(III) complex [Ir(ppy)  2  (Phen&#8208;5&#8208;COO)] by solid phase peptide synthesis. The selected peptide sequences were an enkephalin derivative TyrGlyGlyPheLeu together with the propargyl&#8208;substituted species TyrGlyPglPheLeu to allow gold coordination, and a short peptide, AlaCysAlaPhen, containing a cysteine residue. Introduction of the gold centre has been achieved via a click reaction with the alkynyl group leading to an organometallic Au&#8208;C(triazole) species, or by direct coordination to the sulfur atom of the cysteine. The photophysical properties of these species revealed predominantly an emission originated from the Ir complex, using mixed metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand and ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer excited states of triplet multiplicity. The formation of the peptide bioconjugates caused a systematic red&#8208;shift of the emission profiles. Lysosomal accumulation was observed for all the complexes, in contrast to the expected mitochondrial accumulation triggered by the gold complexes. Only the cysteine&#8208;containing Ir/Au bioconjugate displayed cytotoxic activity. The absence of activity may be related to the lack of endosomal / lysosomal escape for the cationic peptide conjugates. Interestingly, the different coordination sphere of the gold atom may play a crucial role, as the Au&#8208;S(cysteine) bond may be more readily cleaved in a biological environment than the Au&#8208;C(triazole) bond, and thus the Au fragment could be released from or trapped in the lysosomes, respectively.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Natural aminoglycosides are therapeutically useful antibiotics as well as very efficient RNA ligands. They are oligosaccharides containing several ammonium groups able to interfere with the translation process in prokaryotes upon binding to bacterial ribosomal RNA (rRNA) thus impairing protein synthesis. Even if aminoglycosides are commonly used in therapy, these RNA binders lack selectivity, being able to bind to a wide number of RNA sequences/structures. This is one of the reasons for their toxicity and limited applications in therapy. At the same time, the ability of aminoglycosides to bind to various RNAs renders them a great source of inspiration for the synthesis of new binders with improved affinity and specificity toward several therapeutically relevant RNA targets. Thus, a number of studies have been performed on these complex and highly functionalized compounds leading to the development of various synthetic methodologies toward the synthesis of conjugated aminoglycosides. The aim of this review is to highlight recent progresses in the field of aminoglycoside conjugation paying particular attention to the modifications performed toward the improvement of affinity and especially to the selectivity of the resulting compounds. This will help readers understand how to introduce a desired chemical modification for future developments of RNA ligands as antibiotics, antiviral and anticancer compounds.</dc:description>

      <title>Tyrosine conjugation methods for protein labelling</title>
      <dc:description>Over the last two decades, the development of chemical biology and the need for more defined protein conjugates have fostered active research on new bioconjugation techniques.

      <title>The Thioredoxin System: A Promising Target for Cancer Drug Development</title>
      <dc:description>
Anti&#8208;cancer drugs endeavors: Thioredoxin system, composed of thioredoxin (TRX), thioredoxin reductase (TR), and NADPH, plays critical roles in many cellular functions. However, it is also overexpressed in many solid tumor cancers. Thus, many inhibitors have been developed to target TR and TRX, such as, natural products, ebselen analogues, metal complexes, and small molecules. We foresee great potential for future efforts towards developing new inhibitors for this system, including protein and peptide&#8208;based inhibitors, as new anti&#8208;cancer drugs.







Abstract
The thioredoxin system is highly conserved system found in all living cells and comprises NADPH, thioredoxin, and thioredoxin reductase. This system plays a critical role in preserving a reduced intracellular environment, and its involvement in regulating a wide range of cellular functions makes it especially vital to cellular homeostasis. Its critical role is not limited to healthy cells, it is also involved in cancer development, and is overexpressed in many cancers. This makes the thioredoxin system a promising target for cancer drug development. As such, over the last decade, many inhibitors have been developed that target the thioredoxin system, most of which are small molecules targeting the thioredoxin reductase C&#8208;terminal redox center. A few inhibitors of thioredoxin have also been developed. We believe that more efforts should be invested in developing protein/peptide&#8208;based inhibitors against both thioredoxin reductase and/or thioredoxin.

      <title>Metallic Glass Films with Nanostructured Periodic Density Fluctuations Supported on Si/SiO2 as an Efficient Hydrogen Sorber</title>
      <dc:description>
Nanostructured (&#8764;50&#8197;nm) Pd&#8208;Au&#8208;Si based metallic glass films (NMGF) on Si/SiO2 have been synthesized as an efficient hydrogen sorber. A significant number of nanovoids originated from PdHx crystals, and an increase in average interatomic spacing is detected in Pd&#8208;Au&#8208;Si NMGF by high&#8208;resolution TEM linked to the unique density fluctuations. This production and characterization methodology allows for the development of metallic glasses with maximum hydrogen uptake via controllable nanovoid formation.
