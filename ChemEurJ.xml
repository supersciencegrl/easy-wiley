         <title>Biocatalysis in Non&#8208;Conventional Media: Unlocking the Potential for Sustainable Chiral Amine Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The application of biocatalysis has become essential in both academic and industrial domains for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral amines, and it serves as an alternative tool to transition&#8208;metal catalysis and complements traditional chemical methods. It relies on the swift expansion of available processes, primarily as a result of advanced tools for enzyme discovery, combined with high&#8208;throughput laboratory evolution techniques for optimising biocatalysts. This manuscript highlights recent chemical and technological developments contributing to the sustainable applications of biocatalysis with industrial interest. Specifically, the use of non&#8208;conventional reaction media and the combination with photocatalysis can enhance production of chiral amines by allowing higher working concentrations and cascade transformations, leading to high yields and enantiomeric excesses. Furthermore, a selection of both known and modern strategies for enzyme immobilisation, along with the use of fed&#8208;batch and flow synthesis, demonstrates the potential to translate laboratory synthesis to effective scaled&#8208;up applications and improve the processing of large reaction volumes.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidative N&#8211;N Bond Formation Versus the Curtius Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxidative formation of N&#8211;N bonds from primary amides has been recently reported and then retracted in the journal Nature Communications by Kathiravan, Nicholls, and coauthors, utilizing a hypervalent iodane reagent. Unfortunately, the authors failed to recognize the Curtius reaction taking place under the described reaction conditions. Thus, the claimed N&#8211;N coupling products were not formed. Instead, the Curtius rearrangement urea coupling products were obtained. We demonstrate this herein by means of NMR and x&#8208;ray analysis, as well as with the support of an alternative synthetic route.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure Synthesis and Recovery of Single Crystals of the Metastable Manganese Carbide, MnCx</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition metal carbides are used widely throughout industry for their high hardness, superior resistance to corrosion, and stability under extremes of temperature and radiation. Here we describe the discovery of a novel sub&#8208;stoichiometric anti&#8208;NiAs&#8208;type compound, MnCx (P63/mmc), synthesized at pressures between ~5&#8211;10&#8197;GPa and recovered fully to ambient conditions as single crystals.







Abstract
Transition metal carbides find widespread use throughout industry due to their high strength and resilience under extreme conditions. However, they remain largely limited to compounds formed from the early d&#8208;block elements, since the mid&#8208;to&#8208;late transition metals do not form thermodynamically stable carbides. We report here the high&#8208;pressure bulk synthesis of large single crystals of a novel metastable manganese carbide compound, MnCx (P63/mmc), which adopts the anti&#8208;NiAs&#8208;type structure with significant substoichiometry at the carbon sites. We demonstrate how synthesis pressure modulates the carbon loading, with ~40&#8201;% occupancy being achieved at 9.9&#8197;GPa.

         <title>Synthesis of Diverse Allylic Sulfone Derivatives via Sequential Hydroalkoxylation of 1,3&#8208;Enynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature shows the formation of structurally complex &#948;,&#948;&#8208;dimethoxy allyl sulfone derivatives, highlighting the direct nucleophilic attack of methoxide on sulfone&#8208;containing 1,3&#8208;enynes. The magical box metaphorically serves as the focal point, from which a large treasure of diverse and structurally intricate allylic sulfone derivatives bursts forth. The vibrant hue in the background emanating from the box symbolises the energy and excitement of newly synthesized compounds. The use of blue crystals interspersed among the compounds adds an element of elegance and refinement, suggesting the high value of these allylic sulfone derivatives. Surrounding the main stream of light are various allylic sulfone derivatives, adorned with different functional groups, indicating the versatility and potential for customization in their synthesis. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Kumar and B.&#8197;A. Shah (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202401049).

         <title>Discovering of Atomically Precise Metal Nanoclusters by High&#8208;Throughput Syntheses Platform</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we propose a high&#8208;throughput metal nanocluster synthesis method assisted by machine learning, which can accelerate the discovery of nanoclusters, improve the synthesis efficiency, and successfully form a series of nanoclusters (i.&#8201;e., Au41Cu66, Au40Cu34, Au18Cu32, Au18, Au6Cu6, Cu&#8722;NC nanoclusters). This study further reinforces the importance of high&#8208;throughput screening in advancing the field of nanocluster research.







Abstract
Understanding the complete structure of noble metal nanoclusters is both academically and practically significant. However, progress has been hindered by the low synthetic efficiency of many nanocluster syntheses. In this study, we present the first high&#8208;throughput syntheses of homo&#8208;gold, homo&#8208;copper, and gold&#8208;copper alloy nanoclusters in dichloromethane at room temperature. Through high&#8208;throughput screening, we successfully obtained three nanoclusters in a single reaction: Au18(SC6H11)14, [Au41Cu66(SC6H11)44](SbF6)3, and an unidentified copper cluster (referred to as Au18, Au41Cu66, and Cu&#8722;NC). The optimized synthesis route was achieved with the assistance of machine learning for experimental data analysis, which also guided the synthesis of other metal nanoclusters such as Au40Cu34(4&#8208;S&#8208;PhF)40 (Au40Cu34), [Au6Cu6(SPh)12]n ([Au6Cu6]n), and Au18Cu32(3,5&#8208;C8H9S)36 (Au18Cu32)). This research demonstrates that high&#8208;throughput screening can be a valuable tool in accelerating the development of nanocluster syntheses.

         <title>Mechanical Bond Induced Enhancement and Purification of Pyrene Emission in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrene is a well&#8208;known excellent organic luminescent molecule, but it suffers from &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking&#8208;induced aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) in the solid state. In our study, the encapsulation of a crown ether can significantly enhance the fluorescence of the pyrene in the solid state, resulting in a transformation from ACQ to aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE). Moreover, we also found that the original impure emission of the pyrene could be purified to a single emission. More information can be found in the Research Article by Q. Li and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400741).

         <title>Selective Oxidation of Vitamin D3&#160;Enhanced by Long&#8208;Range Effects of a&#160;Substrate Channel Mutation in Cytochrome P450BM3&#160;(CYP102A1)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vitamin D deficiency affects nearly half the population, with many requiring or opting for supplements with vitamin D3(VD3), the precursor of vitamin D (1&#945;,25&#8208;dihydroxyVD3). 25&#8208;HydroxyVD3, the circulating form of vitamin D, is a more effective supplement than VD3&#160;but its synthesis is complex. We report here the engineering of cytochrome P450BM3(CYP102A1) for the selective oxidation of VD3&#160;to 25&#8208;hydroxyVD3. Long&#8208;range&#160;effects of the substrate&#8208;channel mutation Glu435Ile promoted binding of the VD3&#160;side chain close to the heme, enhancing VD3&#160;oxidation activity that reached 6.62 g of 25&#8208;hydroxyVD3&#160;isolated from a 1&#8208;litre scale reaction (69.1% yield; space&#8208;time&#8208;yield 331 mg/L/h).</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular Nucleophilic Vinylic Substitution (SNV) by Carbon Nucleophiles: Conformationally Directed Formation of Dienes from&#160;N,N&#8217;&#8208;Diallyl Ureas</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleophilic vinylic substitution (SNV) by carbon nucleophiles allows the formation of vinylic C&#8211;C bonds without transition metal catalysts. In this paper, we show that tethering two alkenes together through a urea linkage can lead to the formation of a diene by an intramolecular SNV reaction. The starting materials are fully substituted&#160;N,N&#8217;&#8208;diallyl ureas; the reaction proceeds in the presence of base, and entails a cascade of deprotonations, reprotonations, and an SNV reaction of an allylic carbanion on a rare electrophile: a vinylic urea. As a result, two allylic substituents couple to form a diene, despite the fact that neither is activated towards electrophilic attack. The reaction is tolerant of significant steric bulk, and exhibits regioselectivity with unsymmetrical diallyl ureas:&#160;&#946;&#8208;substituted allyl groups invariably behave as nucleophiles, while electrophilic behavior may be enforced by the use of an&#160;E&#8208;vinylic urea substituent that cannot be deprotonated under the reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>High Rotational Barrier Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atropisomers have attracted a great deal of attention lately due to their numerous applications in organic synthesis and to their employment in drug discovery. However, the synthetic arsenal at our disposal with which to access them remains limited. The research described herein is two&#8208;pronged; we both demonstrate the use of MCR chemistry as a synthetic strategy for the de novo synthesis of a class of atropisomers having high barriers to rotation with the simultaneous insertion of multiple chiral elements and we study these unprecedented molecular systems by employing a combination of crystallography, NMR and DFT calculations. By fully exploiting the synthetic capabilities of our chemistry, we have been able to monitor a range of different types of interaction, i.e. &#960;&#8208;&#960;, CH&#8208;&#960;, heteroatom&#8208;&#960; and CD&#8208;&#960;, in order to conduct structure&#8208;property studies. The results could be applied both to atroposelective synthesis and in drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescence of Aggregated Aromatic Peptides for Studying the Kinetics of Aggregation and Hardening of Amyloid&#8208;like Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The capability of amyloid&#8208;like peptide fibers to emit intrinsic&#8208;fluorescence enables the study of their formation, stability and hardening through time&#8208;resolved fluorescence analysis, without the need for additional intercalating dyes. This approach allows the monitoring of amyloid&#8208;like peptides aggregation kinetics using minimal sample volumes, and the simultaneous testing of numerous experimental conditions and analytes, offering rapid and reproducible results. The analytical procedure applied to the aromatic hexapeptide F6, alone or derivatized with PEG (polyethylene glycol) moiety of different lengths, suggests that aggregation into large anisotropic structures negatively correlates with initial monomer concentration and relies on the presence of charged N&#8208; and C&#8208;termini. PEGylation reduces the extent of aggregates hardening, possibly by retaining water, and overall impacts the final structural properties of the aggregates.</dc:description>

         <title>Targeting Manganese Amidinate and &#223;&#8208;Ketoiminate Complexes as Precursors for Mn&#8208;Based Thin Film Deposition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploring new manganese complexes bearing all nitrogen coordinated and mixed oxygen/nitrogen&#8208;coordinated ligand systems revealed very interesting insights on the structure&#8208;property relationship. A comprehensive investigation on the physico&#8208;chemical properties alongside DFT experiments has identified potential precursors for chemical vapor deposition processing of Mn containing thin films.







Abstract
With a focus on Mn based organometallic compounds with suitable physico&#8208;chemical properties to serve as precursors for chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Mn&#8208;containing materials, systematic synthetic approaches with ligand variation, detailed characterization, and theoretical input from density functional theory (DFT) studies are presented. A series of new homoleptic all&#8208;nitrogen and mixed oxygen/nitrogen&#8208;coordinated Mn(II) complexes bearing the acetamidinate, formamidinate, guanidinate and &#223;&#8208;ketoiminate ligands have been successfully synthesized for the first time. The specific choice of these ligand classes with changes in structure and coordination sphere and side chain variations result in significant structural differences whereby mononuclear and dinuclear complexes are formed. This was supported by density functional theory (DFT) studies. The compounds were thoroughly characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, magnetic measurements, mass spectrometry and elemental analysis. To evaluate their suitability as precursors for deposition of Mn&#8208;based materials, the thermal properties were investigated in detail. Mn(II) complexes possessing the most promising thermal properties, namely Bis(N,N&#8217;&#8208;ditertbutylformamidinato)manganese(II) (IV) and Bis(4&#8208;(isopropylamino)pent&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;onato)manganese(II) (&#223;III) were used in reactivity studies with DFT to explore their interaction with oxidizing co&#8208;reactants such as oxygen and water which will guide future CVD and ALD process development.

To evaluate their suitability as precursors for deposition of Mn-based materials, the thermal properties were investigated in detail. Mn(II) complexes possessing the most promising thermal properties, namely Bis(&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8217;-ditertbutylformamidinato)manganese(II) (&lt;b&gt;IV&lt;/b&gt;) and Bis(4-(isopropylamino)pent-3-en-2-onato)manganese(II) (&lt;b&gt;&#223;III&lt;/b&gt;) were used in reactivity studies with DFT to explore their interaction with oxidizing co-reactants such as oxygen and water which will guide future CVD and ALD process development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual Basicity and Nucleophilicity of Organosodium Reagents in Benzylic C&#8722;H Additions of Toluenes to Diarylethenes and Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Profiting on the dual basicity and nucleophilicity of organosodium reagents, a new method for the benzylic C&#8722;H addition of toluenes to diarylethenes and ketones is described. Through careful reaction monitoring and trapping of key reaction intermediates, valuable mechanistic insights have been gained, together with a deeper understanding of the coordination preferences of sodium in these organometallic systems







Abstract
Profiting from the dual high basicity and nucleophilicity of organosodium complexes, here we report the stepwise lateral metalation of a wide range of alkyl arenes (MeAr), mediated by hydrocarbon&#8208;soluble NaCH2SiMe3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;PMDETA (PMDETA=N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;pentamethyldiethylenetriamine), followed by nucleophilic addition to diarylethenes of the newly generated NaCH2Ar&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;PMDETA complexes. This method grants access to a range of functionalised hydrocarbons in excellent yields and can be upgraded to catalytic regimes when using trans&#8208;stilbene, a 10&#8197;mol% of the alkyl sodium base and toluene as a solvent. Extending this approach to aromatic ketones leads to the formation of stilbenes under mild reaction conditions, resulting from the deprotonative coupling of toluenes with ketones. Combining spectroscopic studies with the trapping and characterisation of key reaction intermediates, mechanistic insights have been gained, advancing the understanding of coordination effects in organosodium chemistry, and shedding light on their special reactivity profiles.

         <title>Molecular Hosts for the Sensing and Separation of 99TcO4&#8722;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective recognition and separation of pertechnetate (TcO4&#8722;) is imperative for both nuclear fuel processing and environmental remediation efforts. Supramolecular chemists have addressed these issues by designing receptors inspired by molecular recognition principles. This Concept article explores recent advancements and future directions in TcO4&#8722; sensing and separation from aqueous solutions using molecular hosts.







Abstract
In recent years, European Union member states have hastened energy policy deliberations to address supply and sustainability concerns, placing a significant emphasis on nuclear energy as a means to achieve decarbonization goals. However, despite its significant role in power generation, nuclear energy faces significant challenges linked to fuel reprocessing and waste disposal, that hinder its broader expansion. In this context, the separation of technetium represents a concerning issue. Indeed, technetium&#8216;s catalytic activity can impede the extraction of uranium, neptunium, and plutonium, affecting waste reprocessing efficiency. Additionally, the stable form of technetium in aerobic conditions, pertechnetate (TcO4&#8722;), poses risks of groundwater contamination due to its mobility and solubility. Hence, sensing and separation of TcO4&#8722; is imperative for both nuclear fuel processing and minimising radioactive contamination in the environment. However, the binding of TcO4&#8722; and its separation from contaminated solutions present challenges due to the acidic (or basic) waste components and the high ionic strength in real matrices. Supramolecular chemists have addressed these issues by designing receptors inspired by molecular recognition principles. This article explores recent advancements and future directions in TcO4&#8722; sensing and separation (using extraction and sorption) with a focus on molecular hosts. Metal&#8208;organic receptors will also be discussed.

         <title>Cation&#8208;Stacking Approach Enabling Interconversion between Bis(xanthylium) and its Reduced Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the newly designed cyclophane&#8208;type dications, the xanthylium units facing each other exert attractive rather than repulsive effects, even though there is electrostatic repulsion between cation units. Due to an intramolecular interaction caused by &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, not only the dications but also their reduced species can be stabilized. Thus, stepwise redox interconversion was achieved via radical cation species.







Abstract
Cyclophane&#8208;type dications with two units of xanthylium were designed, with the expectation that intramolecular interaction between cation units could induce changes in absorption and redox behavior. The desired dications were synthesized via the macrocyclic diketone as a key intermediate, which was efficiently obtained by a stepwise etherification. X&#8208;ray and UV/Vis measurements revealed that the cyclophane&#8208;type dications adopt a stacking structure in both the crystal and solution. Due to the intramolecular interaction caused by &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of the xanthylium units, a considerable blue shift compared to the corresponding monocations and a two&#8208;stage one&#8208;electron reduction process were observed in the dications. Furthermore, upon electrochemical reduction of dications, the formation of biradicals via radical cation species was demonstrated by UV/Vis spectroscopy with several isosbestic points at both stages. Therefore, the cation&#8208;stacking approach is a promising way to provide novel properties due to perturbation of their molecular orbitals and to stabilize the reduced species even though they have open&#8208;shell characters.

         <title>C&#8208;Terminal Decarboxylation of Proline&#8208;Derived Building Blocks for Protein&#8208;Binding Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An improved protocol for the C&#8208;terminal decarboxylation of peptidic compounds opens an efficient access to new amino acid&#8208;derived building blocks with potentially improved drug&#8208;like properties. The method was applied in the late&#8208;stage decarboxylation of a polycyclic diproline mimetic and in the synthesis of a first decarboxy&#8208;inhibitor of the EVH1domain.







Abstract
Using a set of conformationally restricted Proline&#8208;derived Modules (ProMs), our group has recently succeeded in developing inhibitors for the enabled/vasodilator&#8208;stimulated phosphoprotein homology&#8197;1 (EVH1) domain, which is a key mediator of cell migration and plays an important role in tumor metastasis. While these (formally) pentapeptidic compounds show nanomolecular binding affinities towards EVH1, their drug&#8208;like properties and cell permeability need to be further optimized before they can be clinically tested as therapeutic agents against metastasis. In this study, we sought to improve these properties by removing the C&#8208;terminal carboxylic acid function of our peptoids, either by late&#8208;stage decarboxylation or by direct synthesis. For late&#8208;stage decarboxylation of ProM&#8208;like systems, a method for reductive halo decarboxylation was optimized and applied to several proline&#8208;derived substrates. In this way, a series of new decarboxy ProMs suitable as building blocks for decarboxy EVH1 inhibitors were obtained. In addition, we incorporated decarboxy&#8208;ProM&#8208;1 into the pentapeptide&#8208;like compound Ac[2ClF][ProM&#8208;2][Decarb&#8208;ProM&#8208;1], which showed similar affinity towards EVH1 as the methyl ester derivative (Ac[2Cl&#8208;F][ProM&#8208;2][ProM1]OMe). However, despite better calculated drug&#8208;like properties, this compound did not inhibit chemotaxis in a cellular assay.

         <title>Uncovering Factors Controlling Reactivity of Metal&#8208;TEMPO Reaction Systems in the Solid State and Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of Et(Cl)Zn with TEMPO is explored as a novel platform for systematic studies on the effect of the metal centre Lewis acidity on the O&#8208; vs N&#8208;radical scavenger TEMPO mode. The reported in&#8208;depth experimental and theoretical studies revealed how the electronic, conformational and steric effects act synergistically in turning the coordinated TEMPO molecule from the O&#8208; to N&#8208;radical scavenger.







Abstract
Nitroxides find application in various areas of chemistry, and a more in&#8208;depth understanding of factors controlling their reactivity with metal complexes is warranted to promote further developments. Here, we report on the effect of the metal centre Lewis acidity on both the distribution of the O&#8208; and N&#8208;centered spin density in 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;N&#8208;oxyl (TEMPO) and turning TEMPO from the O&#8208; to N&#8208;radical mode scavenger in metal&#8208;TEMPO systems. We use Et(Cl)Zn/TEMPO model reaction system with tuneable reactivity in the solid state and solution. Among various products, a unique Lewis acid&#8208;base adduct of Cl2Zn with the N&#8208;ethylated TEMPO was isolated and structurally characterised, and the so&#8208;called solid&#8208;state &#8242;slow chemistry&#8242; reaction led to a higher yield of the N&#8208;alkylated product. The revealed structure&#8208;activity/selectivity correlations are exceptional yet are entirely rationalised by the mechanistic underpinning supported by theoretical calculations of studied model systems. This work lays a foundation and mechanistic blueprint for future metal/nitroxide systems exploration.

&lt;p&gt;The reactivity of Et(Cl)Zn with TEMPO is explored as a novel platform for systematic studies on the effect of the metal centre Lewis acidity on the O- vs N-radical scavenger TEMPO mode. The reported in-depth experimental and theoretical studies revealed how the electronic, conformational and steric effects act synergistically in turning the coordinated TEMPO molecule from the O- to N-radical scavenger.

         <title>Mechanochemical synthesis of corannulene flanked N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) precursors and preparation of their metal complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of new compounds is an important pillar for the advancement of the field of chemistry and adjacent fields. In this regard, over the last decades huge efforts have been made to not only develop new molecular entities but also more efficient sustainable synthetic methodologies due to the increasing concerns over environmental sustainability. In this context, we have developed synthetic routes to novel corannulene flanked imidazolium bromide NHC precursors both in the solid state and solution phases. Our work presents a comprehensive comparative study of mechanochemical routes and conventional solution&#8208;based methods. Green metrics and energy consumption comparison were performed for both routes reveal ball&#8208;milling generation of these compounds to be an environmentally greener technique to produce such precursors compared to conventional solvent&#8208;based methods. In addition, we have demonstrated proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of the herein reported corannulene flanked NHCs to be robust ligands to transition metals and their ligand substitution reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>CoCorrole&#8208;Functionalized PCN&#8208;222 for Carbon Monoxide Selective Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high risk of CO poisoning justifies the need for indoor air quality control and warning systems based on the detection of low concentrations (ppm&#8208;ppb) of CO. Cobalt corrole complexes selectively bind CO vs. O2, CO2, N2, opening new fields of applications. By combining the CO chemisorption properties of cobalt corroles with the known sorption capacity of MOFs, we hope to obtain high performance sensing materials for CO detection. In addition, the exposed metal sites of MOFs lead to CO2 physisorption, allowing the co&#8208;detection of CO and CO2. In this work, PCN&#8208;222 a stable Zr&#8208;based MOF made from Ni(TCPP) with natural vacancies has been used as a porous matrix for the grafting of electron&#8208;poor metallocorroles. The materials were characterized by powder XRD, SEM and optical microscopy, BET analyses and gas adsorption measurements at 298 K. No degradation of the crystalline structure of PCN&#8208;222 was observed. At 1 atm, the adsorbed CO(g) volumes measured for the best materials were 12.15 cm3 g&#8208;1 and 14.01 cm3 g&#8208;1 for CoCorr2@PCN&#8208;222 and CoCorr3@PCN&#8208;222 respectively, and both materials exhibited high CO chemisorption and selectivity against O2, N2, and CO2 at low pressure due to the highest energy of the chemisorption process vs physisorption.

         <title>Steric Effect and Intrinsic Electrophilicity and Nucleophilicity from a Conceptual Density Functional Theory and Information&#8208;Theoretic Approach as Quantitative Probes of Chemical Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Appreciating reactivity in terms of physicochemical effects for chemical processes&#160;is one of the most important undertakings in chemistry. While transition state (TS) theory provides the framework enabling the reliable calculation of the barrier height for a given elementary step, analytical tools are necessary to gain insight into key factors governing the different processes during chemical reactions. In this contribution, we partition the potential energy surface of an elementary step along the intrinsic coordinate into three segments, the so&#8208;called Pre&#8208;TS, TS, and Post&#8208;TS regions, and then determine the most important factors dictating each segment. This analysis is based on the use of both reactivity descriptors from conceptual density functional theory and concepts from the information&#8208;theoretic approach in density functional theory. We found that in both Pre&#8208;TS and Post&#8208;TS regions, steric effects are the dominant factors, whereas in the TS region, it is the intrinsic electrophilic and nucleophilic propensity of the transition state structure that governs the reactivity. The wide applicability of our approach is shown by a validation for a total of 37 organic and inorganic reactions. This work thus, in our view, provides a novel perspective on how chemical reactivity can be quantified at different stages of chemical reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Replication Without Hydrogen&#8208;Bonds: An Exobiotic Design</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Life on Earth uses DNA as the central template for self&#8208;replication, genetic encoding, and information transfer. However, there are no physical laws precluding life&#8217;s existence elsewhere in space, and alternative life forms may not need DNA. In the search for exobiology, knowing what to look for as a biosignature remains a challenge&#8212;especially if it is not from the obvious list of biologic building blocks. Clues from chemicals recently discovered on Mars and in the Taurus Molecular Cloud 1 (TMC&#8208;1), show that intriguing organic compounds exist beyond Earth, which could provide a starting point for unconventional exobiotic designs. Here we present a new self&#8208;replicating system with structural similarities to recently discovered compounds on Mars and TMC&#8208;1. Rather than using DNA&#8217;s hydrogen&#8208;bonding motif for reliable base&#8208;paring, our design employs sulfur&#8208;nitrogen interactions to selectively template unique benzothiadiazole units in sequence. We synthesized and studied two versions of this system, one reversible and the other irreversible, and found experimental evidence of self&#8208;replication in d&#8208;chloroform solvent. These results are part of a larger pursuit in our lab for developing a basis for a potential exobiological system using starting blocks closely related to these cosmic compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Helicene Appended Benzothiadiazoles as Chiral Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly emissive covalently linked benzothiadiazole 4,7&#8208;bis(helicenes), with the [6]helicene representatives showing CPL activity in solution and in the solid state, have been obtained through a straightforward strategy.







Abstract
A homologous series of 4,7&#8208;bis(aryl) substituted benzothiadiazole (BTD) compounds, containing the helicenic derivatives bis([4]helicene), bis([5]helicene) and bis([6]helicene), have been prepared upon a double Suzuki coupling between 3,6&#8208;bis(pinacolyl&#8208;borane)&#8208;BTD and the corresponding bromo&#8208;aryl precursors. The single crystal X&#8208;ray structure of the bis([4]helicene) compound shows the existence of both helicities (M) and (P) on the same molecule. All the compounds of the series are highly emissive in solution, with quantum yields of the emission ranging from 50 to 91&#8201;%.

     alt="Helicene Appended Benzothiadiazoles as Chiral Emitters"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highly emissive covalently linked benzothiadiazole 4,7-bis(helicenes), with the [6]helicene representatives showing CPL activity in solution and in the solid state, have been obtained through a straightforward strategy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A homologous series of 4,7-bis(aryl) substituted benzothiadiazole (BTD) compounds, containing the helicenic derivatives bis([4]helicene), bis([5]helicene) and bis([6]helicene), have been prepared upon a double Suzuki coupling between 3,6-bis(pinacolyl-borane)-BTD and the corresponding bromo-aryl precursors. The single crystal X-ray structure of the bis([4]helicene) compound shows the existence of both helicities (&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;) and (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;) on the same molecule. All the compounds of the series are highly emissive in solution, with quantum yields of the emission ranging from 50 to 91&#8201;%. The enantiopure compounds (&lt;i&gt;M,M&lt;/i&gt;) and (&lt;i&gt;P,P&lt;/i&gt;) for the BTD-bis([6]helicene) have been prepared from the corresponding enantiopure 2-bromo-[6]helicene precursors. Their chiroptical properties have been investigated in correlation with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which allowed to confidently assign the absolute configuration of the helicene arms and to characterize the different electronic transitions, including the low energy charge transfer excitation from helicenes to BTD. The enantiomerically pure fluorophores (&lt;i&gt;M,M&lt;/i&gt;)- and (&lt;i&gt;P,P&lt;/i&gt;)-BTD-bis([6]helicene), which exist in solution as two main conformers, according to the DFT calculations, show CPL activity in solution, with g&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt; factors of &#8776;1.7&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; at &#955;&lt;sub&gt;em&lt;/sub&gt;=525&#8197;nm, and also in the solid state, with g&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt; factors of &#8776;1.2&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; in spite of the strong decrease of the quantum efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Functional Linkers Support Targeting of Multivalent Tweezers to Taspase1</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Taspase 1 is a unique protease not only pivotal for embryonic development but also implicated in leukemias and solid tumors. As such, this enzyme is a promising while still challenging therapeutic target, and with its protein structure featuring a flexible loop preceding the active site a versatile model system for drug development. Supramolecular ligands provide a promising complementary approach to traditional small&#8208;molecule inhibitors. Recently, the multivalent arrangement of molecular tweezers allowed the successful targeting of Taspase 1&#8217;s surface loop. With this study we now want to take the next logic step und utilize functional linker systems that not only allow the implementation of novel properties but also engage in protein surface binding. Consequently, we chose two different linker types differing from the original divalent assembly: a backbone with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties to enable monitoring of binding and a calix[4]arene scaffold initially pre&#8208;positioning the supramolecular binding units. With a series of four AIE&#8208;equipped ligands with stepwise increased valency we demonstrated that the functionalized AIE linkers approach ligand binding affinities in the nanomolar range and allow efficient proteolytic inhibition of Taspase 1. Moreover, implementation of the calix[4]arene backbone further enhanced the ligands&#8217; inhibitory potential, pointing to a specific linker contribution.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly graphitized coal tar pitch&#8208;derived porous carbon as high&#8208;performance lithium storage materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Because of its high specific capacity and superior rate performance, porous carbon is regarded as a potential anode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, porous carbon materials with wide pore diameter distributions suffer from low structural stability and low electrical conductivity during the application process. During this study, the calcium carbonate nanoparticle template method is used to prepare coal tar pitch&#8208;derived porous carbon (CTP&#8208;X). The coal tar pitch&#8208;derived porous carbon has a well&#8208;developed macroporous&#8208;mesoporous&#8208;microporous hierarchical porous network structure, which provides abundant active sites for Li+ storage, significantly reduces polarization and charge transfer resistance, shortens the diffusion path and promotes the rapid transport of Li+. More specifically, the CTP&#8208;2 anode shows high charge capacity (496.9 mAh g&#8208;1 at 50 mA g&#8208;1), excellent rate performance (413.6 mAh g&#8208;1 even at 500 mA g&#8208;1), and high cycling stability (capacity retention rate of about 100% after 1,000 cycles at 2 A g&#8208;1). The clean and eco&#8208;friendly large&#8208;scale utilization of coal tar pitch will facilitate the development of high&#8208;performance anodes in the field of LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Catalytic Metal&#8208;Based Homogeneous&#8208;Heterogeneous Systems in Organic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of metal&#8208;based homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts in the same reaction media is a powerful, yet relatively unexplored approach in organic chemistry. This strategy can address important limitations associated with purely homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysis such as the incompatibility of different catalytic species in solution, or the limited tunability of solid catalysts, respectively. Moreover, the facile reusability of the solid catalyst, contributes to increase the overall sustainability of the process. As a result, this semi&#8208;heterogeneous multi&#8208;catalytic approach has unlocked significant advances in organic chemistry, improving existing reactions and even enabling the discovery of novel transformations, exemplified by the formal alkane metathesis. This concept article aims to showcase the benefits of this strategy through exploration of diverse relevant examples from the literature, hoping to spur research on new metal&#8208;based homogeneous&#8208;heterogeneous catalyst combinations that will result in reactivity challenging to achieve by conventional homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysis alone.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Sulfur based deoxyfluorination reagents are usually derived from the corrosive gas SF4. Herein, we report the synthesis and properties of an easily accessible phosphonium salt [(tmg)3PF]+SF5&#8211; (1) which was obtained from the reaction of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) with tris(tetramethylguanidinyl)phosphine. The performance of this crystalline SF5&#8211; salt as a reagent in deoxyfluorination reactions was investigated together with a second SF5&#8211; salt [(R1)3PF]+SF5&#8211; (2) containing bulky substituents (R1 = 1,3&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylimidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenamino). Both reagents proved to be effective for the deoxyfluorination of various functional groups including alcohols, anhydrides, and amides.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorinated Linkers Enable High&#8208;Voltage Pyrrolidinium&#8208;based Dicationic Ionic Liquid Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel fluorinated, pyrrolidinium&#8208;based dicationic ionic liquids (FDILs) as high&#8208;performance electrolytes in energy storage devices have been prepared, displaying unprecedented electrochemical stabilities (up to 7 V); thermal stability (up to 370 &#176;C) and ion transport (up to 1.45 mS cm&#8209;1). FDILs were designed with a fluorinated ether linker and paired with TFSI/FSI counterions. To comprehensively asess the impact of the fluorinated spacer on their electrochemical, thermal, and physico&#8208;chemical properties, a comparison with their non&#8208;fluorinated counterparts was conducted. With a specific focus on their application as electrolytes in next&#8208;generation high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;ion batteries, the impact of the Li&#8208;salt on the characteristics of dicationic ILs was systematically evaluated. The incorporation of a fluorinated linker demonstrates significantly superior properties compared to their non&#8208;fluorinated counterparts, presenting a promising alternative towards next&#8208;generation high&#8208;voltage energy storage systems.</dc:description>

With a specific focus on their application as electrolytes in next-generation high-voltage lithium-ion batteries, the impact of the Li-salt on the characteristics of dicationic ILs was systematically evaluated. The incorporation of a fluorinated linker demonstrates significantly superior properties compared to their non-fluorinated counterparts, presenting a promising alternative towards next-generation high-voltage energy storage systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrostatic Surface Potentials and Chalcogen&#8208;Bonding Motifs of Substituted 2,1,3&#8208;Benzoselenadiazoles Probed via 77Se Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chalcogen bonds (ChB) are moderately strong, directional, and specific non&#8208;covalent interactions that have garnered substantial interest over the last decades. However, ChB applications are currently hampered by a lack of methods to characterize and control chalcogen bonds. We report on the influence of various substituents (halogens, cyano, and methyl groups) on the observed self&#8208;complementary ChB networks of 2,1,3&#8208;benzoselenadiazoles. From molecular electrostatic potential calculations, we show that the electrostatic surface potentials (ESP) of the &#963;&#8208;holes on selenium are largely influenced by the electron&#8208;withdrawing character of these substituents. Structural analyses via X&#8208;ray diffraction reveal a variety of ChB geometries and binding modes that are rationalized via the computed ESP maps, although the structure of 5,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,1,3&#8208;benzoselenadiazole also demonstrates the influence of steric interactions. 77Se solid&#8208;state magic&#8208;angle spinning NMR spectroscopy, in particular the analysis of the selenium chemical shift tensors, is found to be an effective probe able to characterize both structural and electrostatic features of these self&#8208;complementary ChB systems. We find a positive correlation between the value of the ESP maxima at the &#963;&#8208;holes and the experimentally measured 77Se isotropic chemical shift, while the skew of the chemical shift tensor is established as a metric which is reflective of the ChB binding motif.</dc:description>

         <title>Suppressing Protodeboronation in Cu&#8208;Mediated 19F/18F&#8208;Fluorination of Arylboronic Acids: A Mechanistically Guided Approach Towards Optimized PET Probe Development</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorinated arenes play a crucial role in drug discovery, specialty materials, and medical imaging. Although several variants for Cu&#8208;mediated nucleophilic fluorination of arylboronic acids and derivatives have been developed, these protocols rarely address the occurrence and control of protodeboronation, which greatly complicates product separation and can compromise the effectiveness of a radiotracer for in vivo imaging. Consequently, simpler and more efficient procedures are needed to allow rapid 18F/19F&#8208;fluorination of both arylboronic acids and esters while minimizing protodeboronation. Mechanistic controls revealed that in addition to a high temperature, strong donor ligands such as acetonitrile and pyridine accentuate a Cu&#8208;mediated protodeboronation. This observation guided the optimization of a ligandless procedure with t&#8208;BuOH as solvent to enhance the nucleophilicity of fluoride under milder conditions at lower temperatures minimizing protodeboronation. Additionally, a new copper salt, Cu(ONf)2 was employed to further improve the fluorination efficiency. A large range of functional groups are tolerated under the new procedure, which is complete within 30 minutes at a temperature of 60 &#176;C, and affords fluorinated arenes and heteroarenes in 39% to 84% yield. With minimal modifications, the protocol can also be applied in 18F&#8208;radiofluorination, affording radiochemical conversions (RCCs) between 17&#8208;54% with minimal protodeboronation compared to previously established protocols.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling (E/Z)&#8208;Stereoselectivity of &#8208;NHC=O Chlorination: Mechanism Principles for Wide Scope Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic halogen compounds are cornerstones of applied chemical sciences. Halogen substitution is a smart molecular design strategy adopted to influence reactivity, membrane permeability and receptor interaction. Chiral bioreceptors may restrict the stereochemical requirements in the halo&#8208;ligand design. Straightforward (but expensive) catalyzed stereospecific halogenation has been reported. Historically, PCl5 served access to uncatalyzed stereoselective chlorination although the stereochemical outcomes were influenced by steric parameters. Nonetheless, stereochemical investigation of PCl5 reaction mechanism with carbamoyl (RCONHX) compounds has never been addressed. Herein, we provide the first comprehensive stereochemical mechanistic explanation outlining halogenation of carbamoyl compounds with PCl5; the key regioselectivity&#8208;limiting nitrilimine intermediate (8&#8208;Z.HCl); how substitution pattern influences regioselectivity; why oxadiazole byproduct (P1) is encountered; stereo&#8208;electronic factors influencing the hydrazonoyl chloride (P2) production; and discovery of two stereoselectivity&#8208;limiting parallel mechanisms (stepwise and concerted) of elimination of HCl and POCl3. DFT calculations, synthetic methodology optimization, X&#8208;ray evidence and experimental reaction kinetics study evidence all supported the suggested mechanism proposal (Scheme 2). Finally, we provide mechanism&#8208;inspired future recommendations for directing the reaction stereoselectivity toward elusive and stereochemically inaccessible (E)&#8208;bis&#8208;hydrazonoyl chlorides along with potentially pivotal applications of both (E/Z)&#8208;stereoisomers especially in medicinal chemistry and protein modification.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Considering the broad use of the trifluoromethyl functional group (&#8208;CF3) in medicinal chemistry and taking into account the recent concerns on the negative environmental effects of CF3 containing compounds, we are searching for &#8220;greener&#8221; alternatives. Thus, different chemical groups (i.e. iodide, fluoride, cyclopropyl, isopropyl, cyclobutyl, 3&#8208;oxetyl, 2&#8208;oxetyl, methylsulfide, pentafluorosulfide, methylsulfonyl and sulfonamide) have been considered as potential bioequivalents of &#8208;CF3 aiming to use them in compounds with therapeutic interest instead of the polyfluoride functionality. Different structural (molecular surface and volume) and physicochemical (electronic and lipophilic) aspects of the bioequivalent functionalities proposed have been theoretically calculated and compared to those of &#8208;CF3. Additionally, the corresponding phenyl derivatives carrying these functionalities have been purchased or prepared and their experimental lipophilicity (i.e. LogP) measured using shake&#8208;flask experiments and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Excited&#8208;state Dynamics in Segregated Donor&#8208;acceptor Stacks Versus A Peri&#8208;bisdonor&#8208;acceptor System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The investigation of impact of through&#8208;space/through&#8208;bond electronic interaction among chromophores on photoexcited&#8208;state properties has immense potential owing to the distinct emergent photophysical pathways. Herein, the photoexcited&#8208;state dynamics of homo&#8208;sorted &#960;&#8208;stacked aggregates of a naphthalenemonoimide and perylene&#8208;based acceptor&#8208;donor (NI&#8208;Pe) system and a fork&#8208;shaped acceptor&#8208;bisdonor (NI&#8208;Pe2) system possessing integrally stacked peri&#8208;substituted donors was examined. Femtosecond transient absorption (fsTA) spectra of NI&#8208;Pe monomer recorded in chloroform displayed spectroscopic signatures of the singlet state of Pe; 1Pe*, the charge&#8208;separated state; NI&#8208;&#9679;&#8208;Pe+&#9679;, and the triplet state of Pe; 3Pe*. The examination of ultrafast excited&#8208;state processes of NI&#8208;Pe aggregate in chloroform revealed faster charge recombination (&#120591;&#119862;&#119877;&#119886; = 1.75 ns) than the corresponding monomer (&#120591;&#119862;&#119877;&#119898; = 2.46 ns) which was followed by observation of a broad structureless band attributed to an excimer&#8208;like state. The fork&#8208;shaped NI&#8208;Pe2 displayed characteristic spectroscopic features of the NI radical anion (&#955;max~450 nm) and perylene dimer radical cation (&#955;max~520 nm) upon photoexcitation in non&#8208;polar toluene solvent in the nanosecond transient absorption (nsTA) spectroscopy. The investigation highlights the significance of intrinsic close&#8208;stacked arrangement of donors&#160;in ensuring a long&#8208;lived photoinduced charge&#8208;separated state (&#120591;&#119862;&#119877; = 1.35 &#956;s) in non&#8208;polar solvents via delocalization of radical cation between the donors.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boron&#8208;doped helicenes, known for their unique electronic and photophysical properties, are of great interest for numerous applications. This research introduces two new azabora[6]helicenes, H[6]BN1 and H[6]BN2, synthesized through an efficient method. These molecules have boron and nitrogen atoms in opposing positions, enhancing their distinctive attributes. Both helicenes show excellent emission properties, with H[6]BN1 and H[6]BN2 exhibiting narrowband blue fluorescence and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), achieving glum values of 4~5 &#215;10&#8208;4 which is beneficial for chiroptical applications. The addition of a donor group, 3, 6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole, in H[6]BN2 improves luminescence, likely due to enhanced molecular orbital overlap and electron delocalization. H[6]BN1's needle&#8208;like single crystals exhibit mechanochromism, changing luminescent color from yellow to green under mechanical stress, which is promising for stimulus&#8208;responsive materials. In conclusion, this study presents a novel class of BN[6]helicenes with superior chiroptical properties. Their combination of electronic features and mechanochromism makes them ideal for advanced chiroptical materials, expanding the potential of helicene&#8208;based compounds and offering new directions for the synthesis of molecules with specific chiroptical characteristics.</dc:description>

         <title>Pre&#8208;Coordination Induced Further Deamination to Create Inter&#8208;Chain Cross&#8208;Linking in Carbon Nitride for Enhanced Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Creating cross&#8208;linking to establish efficient inter&#8208;chain charge&#8208;transfer channels in carbon nitride represents a promising strategy for enhancing its photocatalytic capabilities. Molten salt&#8208;assisted calcining has emerged as a method for preparing cross&#8208;linked carbon nitrides. However, the precise influence of molten salts on the molecular structure of carbon nitride remains to be fully elucidated. Herein, we develop a KCl guided cross&#8208;linking reaction to preliminarily reveal the formation mechanism of cross&#8208;linking. The cross&#8208;linking reaction is initiated by the pre&#8208;coordination of amino groups with K+. Subsequent heating at high temperature converts the amino groups into chlorines. Then, dechlorination leads to the formation of cross&#8208;linking. Thus, this cross&#8208;linking reaction can be accurately described as a pre&#8208;coordination&#8208;induced, two&#8208;step deamination reaction. The pre&#8208;coordination step plays a pivotal role in the cross&#8208;linking process. Sufficient pre&#8208;coordination results in a relatively high cross&#8208;linking degree of the as&#8208;prepared CNK&#8208;2. Consequently, CNK&#8208;2 demonstrates a significantly enhanced photocatalytic H2O2 production, with a generation rate of 682 &#956;mol&#183;L&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1, about 59 times that of traditional carbon nitride.</dc:description>

         <title>Lead Bromide Complex in Tri&#8208;n&#8208;octylphosphine Oxide Matrix with Bright Photoluminance and Exceptional Thermoplasticity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal halide materials have recently drawn increasing research interest for their excellent opto&#8208;electronic properties and structural diversity, but their resulting rigid structures render them brittle and poor formability during manufacturing. Here we demonstrate a thermoplastic luminant hybrid lead halide solid by integrating lead bromide complex into tri&#8208;n&#8208;octylphosphine oxide (TOPO) matrix. The construction of the hybrid materials can be achieved by a simple dissolution process, in which TOPO molecules act as the solvents and ligands to yield the monodispersed clusters. The combination of these functional units enables the near&#8208;room&#8208;temperature melt&#8208;processing of the materials into targeted geometry by simple molding or printing techniques, which offer possibilities for fluorescent writing inks with outstanding self&#8208;healing capacity to physical damage. The intermarriage between metal halide clusters with functional molecules expands the range of practical applications for hybrid metal halide materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Opportunities of MXenes in Heterogeneous Catalysis: V2C as Aerobic Oxidation Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 37, July 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept aims to illustrate the possibility to employ V2C MXene as a reusable heterogeneous solid catalyst for the aerobic oxidation of indane to indanol/indanone mixture with high conversion and selectivity under solvent free conditions. Further, the influence of surface terminal groups in MXene in oxidation reaction is also studied.







Abstract
MXenes are two&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials having alternating sheets of one atom&#8208;thick early transition metal layer and one atom&#8208;thick carbide or nitride layer. The external surface contains termination groups, whose nature depends on the etching agent used in the preparation procedure from the MAX phase. The present concept proposes that, due to their composition, the metal&#8208;surface termination groups make MXenes particularly suited as heterogeneous catalysts for some reactions. This proposal comes from the consideration that early transition metal atoms bonded to hydroxyl and oxo groups are a general type of active sites in heterogeneous catalysis and that similar catalytic centers can also be present in the MXene structure. After having presented the concept, we have selected V2C Mxene as an example to illustrate its catalytic activity and to show how the catalytic performance varies when the surface groups are modified. As a test reaction, we selected the aerobic oxidation of indane to the corresponding indanol/indanone mixture using molecular oxygen as terminal oxidizing reagent. Two previously reported procedures to modify the surface groups, namely surface dehydroxylation by thermal treatment under diluted hydrogen flow and surface oxidation with ammonium persulfate to convert some surface groups into oxo groups were used, observing in both cases a decrease in the catalytic activity of V2C. Based on this, VIII/IV&#8208;OH are proposed as catalytic centers in this aerobic oxidation. Overall, the present concept shows the merits of MXenes in heterogeneous catalysis, based on their chemical composition and the surface functionality.

         <title>Xanthene&#8208;Based Dyes for Photoacoustic Imaging and their Use as Analyte&#8208;Responsive Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 37, July 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing near&#8208;infrared absorbing dyes tailored for photoacoustic imaging (PAI) applications will advance this emerging non&#8208;invasive deep&#8208;tissue imaging approach. Herein, we present strategies for tuning the classical xanthene scaffold for uses in PAI, and how activity&#8208;based sensing strategies can be applied to design xanthene&#8208;based, analyte&#8208;responsive probes to illuminate changes in disease biochemistry.







Abstract
Developing imaging tools that can report on the presence of disease&#8208;relevant analytes in multicellular organisms can provide insight into fundamental disease mechanisms as well as provide diagnostic tools for the clinic. Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a light&#8208;in, sound&#8208;out imaging technique that allows for high resolution, deep&#8208;tissue imaging with applications in pre&#8208;clinical and point&#8208;of&#8208;care settings. The continued development of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorbing small&#8208;molecule dyes promises to improve the capabilities of this emerging imaging modality. For example, new dye scaffolds bearing chemoselective functionalities are enabling the detection and quantification of disease&#8208;relevant analytes through activity&#8208;based sensing (ABS) approaches. Recently described strategies to engineer NIR absorbing xanthenes have enabled development of analyte&#8208;responsive PAI probes using this classic dye scaffold. Herein, we present current strategies for red&#8208;shifting the spectral properties of xanthenes via bridging heteroatom or auxochrome modifications. Additionally, we explore how these strategies, coupled with chemoselective spiroring&#8208;opening approaches, have been employed to create ABS probes for in&#8197;vivo detection of hypochlorous acid, nitric oxide, copper (II), human NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase isozyme 1, and carbon monoxide. Given the versatility of the xanthene scaffold, we anticipate continued growth and development of analyte&#8208;responsive PAI imaging probes based on this dye class.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Based Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 37, July 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly active alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) electrocatalysts are critical for hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cells. In this concept, we address the current understanding about the alkaline HOR mechanism and summarize recent advances of Ir&#8208;based electrocatalysts with enhanced alkaline HOR activity. We also discuss the perspectives and challenges on Ir&#8208;based electrocatalysts in the future.







Abstract

         <title>A Cu/MnOx Composite with Copper&#8208;Doping&#8208;Induced Oxygen Vacancies as a Cathode for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 37, July 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We use a simple hydrothermal synthesis method to compound MnOx and Cu. Cu doping can cause the creation of an oxygen vacancy, which increases the material&#8216;s internal electric field and enhances cycle stability. MnOx also has great cyclic stability and promotes ion transport. At a current density of 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, the Cu/MnOx nanocomposite obtained a high specific capacitance of 304.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. In addition, Cu/MnOx nanocomposites showed A high specific capacity of 198.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at a current density of 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries are anticipated to be the next generation of important energy storage devices to replace lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to the ongoing use of lithium resources and the safety hazards associated with organic electrolytes in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Manganese&#8208;based compounds, including MnOx materials, have prominent places among the many zinc&#8208;ion battery cathode materials. Additionally, Cu doping can cause the creation of an oxygen vacancy, which increases the material&#8216;s internal electric field and enhances cycle stability. MnOx also has great cyclic stability and promotes ion transport. At a current density of 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, the Cu/MnOx nanocomposite obtained a high specific capacitance of 304.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1.

Therefore, Cu/MnOx nanocomposites are expected to be a strong contender for the next generation of zinc&#8208;ion battery cathode materials in high energy density storage systems.

         <title>Studying Cation Exchange in {Cr7Co} Pseudorotaxanes: Preparatory Studies for Making Hybrid Molecular Machines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 37, July 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
1H NMR spectroscopy is applied to study the relative binding affinities between a {Cr7Co} macrocycle (Cr7Co=Cr7CoF8(O2CCH2tBu)16) and a series of linear alkylammonium threads. The ammonium cation is observed to exchange in solution using 1H NMR spectroscopy and kinetic studies show that the exchange takes place via a dissociative mechanism. The position of the equilibrium is dependent upon the solvent and structure of the ammonium. Collision&#8208;induced dissociation mass spectrometry (CID&#8208;MS) is used to measure the energy needed to induce 50&#8201;% of the precursor ion loss (E50). The trend in pseudorotaxane stabilities is similar when compared to the NMR trends in acetone&#8208;d6. These preliminary studies yield information which are valuable in the future design of hybrid inorganic&#8208;organic molecular machines.







Abstract
In the design of dynamic supramolecular systems used in molecular machines, it is important to understand the binding preferences between the macrocycle and stations along the thread. Here, we apply 1H NMR spectroscopy to investigate the relative stabilities of a series of linear alkylammonium templated pseudorotaxanes with the general formula [H2NRR&#8217;][Cr7CoF8(O2CCH2tBu)16] by exchanging the cation in solution. Our results show that the pseudorotaxanes are able to exchange threads via a dissociative mechanism. The position of equilibrium is dependent upon the ammonium cation and solvent used. Short chain primary ammonium cations are shown to be far less favourable macrocycle stations than secondary ammonium cations. Collision&#8208;induced dissociation mass spectrometry (CID&#8208;MS) has been used to look at disassembly of the pseudorotaxanes in a solvent&#8208;free environment and stability trends compared to those in acetone&#8208;d6. The energy needed to induce 50&#8201;% of the precursor ion loss (E50) is used and shows a similar trend to the equilibria measured by NMR. The relative stabilities of these hybrid inorganic&#8208;organic pseudo&#8208;rotaxanes are different to those of host&#8208;guest compounds involving crown ethers and this may be valuable for the design of molecular machines.

         <title>Exploring the Role of Central Metals in Bulky Phthalocyanines for Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 37, July 2, 2024. </description>

A series of metallo&#8208;(Zn(II), Mg(II) and Ru(II)) and free&#8208;base phthalocyanines (Pcs) with a carboxyl anchoring group and either tert&#8208;butyl or bulky 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenoxy peripheral substituents were synthesized and tested as sensitizer in DSSCs to shed light on the role of central metals in photovoltaic performance. Regardless of peripheral substitution, the trend of photovoltaic efficiencies followed the order Zn(II)Pc&gt;Mg(II)Pc&#8811;H2Pc &#8776; Ru(II)Pc.







Abstract
Two series of metallo&#8208;(Zn(II), Mg(II), and Ru(II)) and free&#8208;base phthalocyanines (Pcs) with a carboxyl anchoring group and well&#8208;established bulky peripheral substituents (either tert&#8208;butyl or bulky 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenoxy) were synthesized and tested as sensitizers in dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The trend of photovoltaic efficiencies (PCEs) for free&#8208;base and metallo Pcs followed the order Zn(II)Pc&gt;Mg(II)Pc&#8811;H2Pc &#8776; Ru(II)Pc regardless of the peripheral substitution. Higher efficiencies (4.95 versus 3.63 for the Zn(II) derivatives) were achieved with Pcs bearing the bulkier 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenoxy group, indicating a lower aggregation and more suitable HOMO&#8208;LUMO levels. Furthermore, these derivatives showed a morelevant influence of the metal on the PCE values (from the highest 4.95 for the Zn(II)Pc to the lowest 0.23 for the Ru(II)Pc. In both series, the best PCEs observed with the Zn(II) derivatives were mainly due to their highest Jsc values. The lowest efficiencies found for the free&#8208;bases and Ru(II) derivatives were attributed to a mismatch between their LUMO levels and the conduction band of the TiO2,and lower light&#8208;harvesting capabilities, respectively. In conclusion, Zn(II) derivatives are still the best Pc candidates to use as sensitizers in molecular photovoltaics.

         <title>Determining Structures of Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Spin&#8208;Coated Zinc Dicarboxylate&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Thin Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 37, July 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structures of metal&#8208;organic thin films obtained from layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer spin&#8208;coating are determined by combining grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and ab&#8197;initio density functional theory simulations. The Zn2+&#8208;to&#8208;dicarboxylic linker molar ratio used for spin&#8208;coating pivotally influences the resulting structure. High excess of Zn2+ generates dicarboxylate&#8208;intercalated layered zinc hydroxides, whereas equimolar ratios or slight excess of the linker yield metal&#8208;(hydroxide&#8208;)organic frameworks.







Abstract
Thin films of crystalline solids with substantial free volume built from organic chromophores and metal secondary building units (SBUs) are promising for engineering new optoelectronic properties through control of interchromophore coupling. Zn&#8208;based SBUs are especially relevant in this case because they avoid quenching the chromophore's luminescence. We find that layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer spin&#8208;coating using Zn acetate dihydrate and benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (H2BDC) and biphenyl&#8208;4,4&#8217;&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (H2BPDC) linkers readily produces crystalline thin films. However, analysis of the grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (GIWAXS) data reveals the structures of these films vary significantly with the linker, and with the metal&#8208;to&#8208;linker molar ratio used for fabrication. Under equimolar conditions, H2BPDC creates a type of structure like that proposed for SURMOF&#8208;2, whereas H2BDC generates a different metal&#8208;hydroxide&#8208;organic framework. Large excess of Zn2+ ions causes the growth of layered zinc hydroxides, irrespective of the linker used. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide structural models with minimum total energy that are consistent with the experimentally observed diffractograms. In the broader sense, this work illustrates the importance in this field of careful structure determination, e.&#8201;g., by utilizing GIWAXS and DFT simulations to determine the structure of the obtained crystalline metal&#8208;organic thin films, such that properties can be rationally engineered and explained.

         <title>Pronounced Self&#8208;Induced Diastereomeric Anisochronism in Anisidine Amino Acid Diamides</title>

Self&#8208;recognition of enantiomers: Anisidine amino acid diamides show extraordinary signal splitting in NMR spectra through supramolecular interaction and homochiral self&#8208;recognition making them to versatile NMR shift&#8208;reagents.







Abstract
The emergent properties resulting from selective supramolecular interactions are of significant importance for materials and chemical systems. For the directed use of such properties, a fundamental understanding of the interaction mechanism and the resulting mode of function is necessary for a tailored design. The self&#8208;induced diastereomeric anisochronism effect (SIDA), which occurs in the intermolecular interaction of chiral molecules, generates unique properties such as chiral self&#8208;recognition and nonlinear effects. Here we show that anisidine amino acid diamides lead to extraordinary signal splitting in NMR spectra through supramolecular interaction and homochiral self&#8208;recognition. By systematic experiments we have investigated the underlying SIDA effect, explored its limits and finally successfully utilized it in the determination of enantiomeric ratios by NMR spectroscopy of chiral &#8216;SIDA&#8208;inactive&#8217; compounds such as thalidomide.

         <title>Directly&#8208;Fused Ni(II)Porphyrin Conjugated Polymers with Blocked meso&#8208;Positions: Impact on Electrocatalytic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 37, July 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the synthesis via chemical vapor deposition of directly fused porphyrins conjugated polymers from Ni(II)porphyrin with blocked meso&#8208;positions. The electrochemical findings highlight that multiple direct fusion (&#946;&#8208;&#946;/meso&#8208;meso/&#946;&#8208;&#946; or meso&#8208;&#946;/&#946;&#8208;meso) is essential for the Ni(II) porphyrin&#8208;based conjugated polymer to operate via a dinuclear radical oxo&#8208;coupling (ROC) mechanism for water oxidation at low overpotential and ensure durable catalytic properties.







Abstract
The oxidative coupling reaction of two Ni(II) porphyrins meso&#8208;substituted with three and four phenyl groups, Ni(II) 5,10,15&#8208;(triphenyl)porphyrin (NiPh3P) and Ni(II) 5,10,15,20&#8208;(tetraphenyl)porphyrin (NiPh4P) respectively, was investigated in a oxidative chemical vapor deposition (oCVD) process. Irrespective of the number of meso&#8208;substituents, high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry evidences the formation of oligomeric species containing up to five porphyrin units. UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR and XPS analyses of the oCVD films highlighted a strong dependence of the intermolecular coupling reaction with the substrate temperature. Specifically, higher substrate temperatures yield lowering of valence band maxima and reduction of the band gap. The formation of conjugated polymeric assemblies results in increased conductivities as compared to their sublimed counterparts. Yet, electrocatalytic measurements exhibit water oxidation onset overpotentials (308&#8197;mV for pNiPh3P and 343&#8197;mV for pNiPh4P) comparatively higher than the onset overpotential measured for the oCVD film from Ni(II) 5,15&#8208;(diphenyl)porphyrin (pNiPh2P), i.&#8201;e. 283&#8197;mV. Although DFT and comparative oCVD studies suggest the formation of directly fused porphyrins involving &#8216;phenyl&#8208;mediated&#8217; and &#946;&#8208;&#946; linkages when reacting tetra&#8208;meso&#8208;substituted porphyrins, the present findings highlight that multiple direct fusion (&#946;&#8208;&#946;/meso&#8208;meso/&#946;&#8208;&#946; or meso&#8208;&#946;/&#946;&#8208;meso) is essential for Ni(II) porphyrin&#8208;based conjugated polymers to enable a dinuclear radical oxo&#8208;coupling operating mechanism for water oxidation at low overpotential and durable catalytic activity.

         <title>Enhancing Control Over Nitric Oxide Photorelease via a Molecular Keypad Lock</title>

A molecular keypad lock based on a ruthenium nitrito complex allows for the double&#8208;secure release of the bioactive nitric oxide molecule. The sequential introduction of protons and light to the system results in the release of nitric oxide whose concentration is predicted using an artificial intelligence model.







Abstract
Based on Boolean logic, molecular keypad locks secure molecular information, typically with an optical output. Here we investigate a rare example of a molecular keypad lock with a chemical output. To this end, the light&#8208;activated release of biologically important nitric oxide from a ruthenium complex is studied, using proton concentration and photon flux as inputs. In a pH&#8208;dependent equilibrium, a nitritoruthenium(II) complex is turned into a nitrosylruthenium(II) complex, which releases nitric oxide under irradiation with visible light. The precise prediction of the output nitric oxide concentration as function of the pH and photon flux is achieved with an artificial intelligence approach, namely the adaptive neuro&#8208;fuzzy inference system. In this manner an exceptionally high level of control over the output concentration is obtained. Moreover, the provided concept to lock a chemical output as well as the output prediction may be applied to other (photo)release schemes.

         <title>Wavelength&#8208;Dependent Activation of Photoacids and Bases</title>

The wavelength&#8208;by&#8208;wavelength&#8208;resolved photoreactivity of a photoacid and a base is mapped in a simple and facile manner via pH monitoring, revealing a marked mismatch of photochemical reactivity and absorptivity of the acids and bases.







Abstract
Photoacids and bases allow remote control over pH in reaction solutions, which is of fundamental importance to an array of applications. Herein, we determine the wavelength&#8208;by&#8208;wavelength resolved photoreactivity of triarylsulfonium hexafluorophosphate salts as a representative photoacid generator and p&#8208;(benzoyl)benzyl triethylammonium tetraphenylborate as a photobase generator, constructing a wavelength&#8208;resolved photochemical action plot for each of the compounds. We monitor the pH change of the solution on&#8208;line within the cavity of the laser vial and demonstrate a marked mismatch between the absorption spectrum of the photoacid and base with the photochemical action plot, unveiling reactivity at very low absorptivities. Our findings are of critical importance for the use of photoacids and bases, unambiguously demonstrating that absorption is no guide to chemical reactivity with critical consequences for the wavelength employed in applications of photoacids and bases.

         <title>Alkene Cross&#8208;Metathesis with 2,5&#8208;Dimethyl&#8208;2,4&#8208;Hexadiene Enables Isobutylenyl/Prenyl Functionalizations and Rubber Valorization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 37, July 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
2,5&#8208;Dimethyl&#8208;2,4&#8208;hexadiene is presented here as a suitable and selective reactant for delivering either prenyl or isobutylenyl groups to alkenes through a cross&#8208;metathesis reaction. The process smoothly operates at room temperature, give high yields of products, includes a late&#8208;stage transformation, and enables the valorization of real samples of recycled rubber.







Abstract
2,5&#8208;Dimethyl&#8208;2,4&#8208;hexadiene is a readily available and easily managable compound, whose symmetric and polymethylated dienic structure should be prone to engage in cross&#8208;metathesis reactions with other alkenes, but this has not been apparently exploited so far. Here we show that this reactant enables the easy synthesis of tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;susbtituted alkenes (i.&#8201;e. isobutylenyl and prenyl groups) from simple alkenes under mild reaction conditions, not only with the conventional 2nd generation Grubbs catalyst but also with other Grela&#8208;type catalyts such as StickyCat,TM AquaMetTM and GreenCatTM. The use of liquid and low volatile 2,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,4&#8208;hexadiene avoids the use of gaseous alkene reactants and, besides, showcases the reactivity of polyisoprene (rubber), thus allowing to optimize the reaction conditions for rubber upcycling, after metathesis reaction of the pristine or used polymer with simple alkenes. These results bring low volatile isoprene&#8208;type compounds as privileged poly&#8208;substituted reactants for alkene cross&#8208;metathesis reactions.

         <title>Modulating the Coordination Chemistry of Cobalt Catalytic Sites by Ruthenium Species to Accelerate the Polysulfide Conversion Kinetics in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 37, July 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The well&#8208;dispersed Ru in the Co&#8722;NC carbon matrix altered the total charge distribution over the Co&#8722;N&#8722;C catalytic sites and led to the formation of electron&#8208;rich Co&#8722;N, which is highly active for the polysulfide conversion reactions. Additionally, introducing Ru in the Co&#8722;NC matrix provided additional catalytic sites over the Ru&#8722;Nx species to manifest optimal adsorption behavior of polysulfides.







Abstract
The performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries is compromised by the loss of sulfur as dissolved polysulfides in the electrolyte and consequently the polysulfide redox shutting effect. Accelerating the conversion kinetics of polysulfide intermediates into sulfur or lithium sulfide through electrocatalysis has emerged as a root&#8208;cause solution. Co&#8722;N&#8722;C composite electrocatalyst is commonly used for this purpose. It is illustrated here that how the effectiveness can be improved by modulating the coordination chemistry of Co&#8722;N&#8722;C catalytic sites through introducing Ru species (RuCo&#8722;NC). The well&#8208;dispersed Ru in the Co&#8722;NC carbon matrix altered the total charge distribution over the Co&#8722;N&#8722;C catalytic sites and led to the formation of electron&#8208;rich Co&#8722;N, which is highly active for the polysulfide conversion reactions. Using Ru to modulate the electronic structure in the Co&#8722;N&#8722;C configuration and the additional catalytic sites over the Ru&#8722;Nx species can manifest optimal adsorption behavior of polysulfides. Consequently, the sulfur cathode with RuCo&#8722;NC can reduce the capacity fade rate from 0.11&#8201;% per cycle without catalyst (initial capacity of 701&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) to 0.054&#8201;% per cycle (initial capacity of 1074&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) over 400 cycles at 0.2&#8197;C rate. The results of this study provide the evidence for a feasible catalyst modification strategy for the polysulfide electrocatalysis.

An efficient RuPHOX&#8722;Ru catalyzed asymmetric cascade hydrogenation of 3&#8208;substituted chromones has been achieved under mild reaction conditions, affording the corresponding chiral 3&#8208;substituted chromanols in high yields with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities.

Abstract
An efficient RuPHOX&#8722;Ru catalyzed asymmetric cascade hydrogenation of 3&#8208;substituted chromones has been achieved under mild reaction conditions, affording the corresponding chiral 3&#8208;substituted chromanols in high yields with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% yield, &gt;99&#8201;% ee and &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). Control reactions and deuterium labelling experiments revealed that a dynamic kinetic resolution process occurs during the subsequent hydrogenation of the C=O double bond, which is responsible for the high performance of the asymmetric cascade hydrogenation. The resulting products allow for several transformations and it was shown that the protocol provides a practical and alternative strategy for the synthesis of chiral 3&#8208;substituted chromanols and their derivatives.

         <title>Synthesis of Indolines via Base&#8208;Mediated C&#8722;H Activation and Defluorinative C&#8722;N Coupling, with no Need for Transition&#8208;Metals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 37, July 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A domino reaction featuring C&#8722;H activation and C&#8722;N coupling condenses ortho&#8208;fluorotoluenes and imines to give non fully aromatic indoline cores, that are not readily available by standard methods. Neither transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalysts nor high pressure conditions are required for this straightforward, base&#8208;mediated synthesis.







Abstract
Syntheses of (partially) aromatic nitrogen heterocycles increasingly rely on transition&#8208;metal catalyzed C&#8722;C&#8208; and C&#8722;N&#8208;cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Here we describe a different approach to the synthesis of indolines by a domino C(sp3)&#8722;H activation, 1,2&#8208;addition, and defluorinative SNAr&#8208;cyclization sequence to provide the target 1,2&#8208;diarylindolines (1,2&#8208;diaryl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydroindoles) from ortho&#8208;fluorinated methyl&#8208;arenes and N&#8208;aryl imines (benzylidene anilines) in a cyclocondensation that is mediated by potassium hexamethyldisilazide (KHMDS) as base exclusively. This transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free process via C&#8722;H and C&#8722;F bond activation provides a one&#8208;step entry into a wide array of indoline scaffolds (43 examples, up to 96&#8201;% yield).

     alt="Synthesis of Indolines via Base-Mediated C&#8722;H Activation and Defluorinative C&#8722;N Coupling, with no Need for Transition-Metals"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A domino reaction featuring C&#8722;H activation and C&#8722;N coupling condenses &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-fluorotoluenes and imines to give non fully aromatic indoline cores, that are not readily available by standard methods. Neither transition-metal-catalysts nor high pressure conditions are required for this straightforward, base-mediated synthesis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Syntheses of (partially) aromatic nitrogen heterocycles increasingly rely on transition-metal catalyzed C&#8722;C- and C&#8722;N-cross-coupling reactions. Here we describe a different approach to the synthesis of indolines by a domino C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H activation, 1,2-addition, and defluorinative S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;Ar-cyclization sequence to provide the target 1,2-diarylindolines (1,2-diaryl-2,3-dihydroindoles) from &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-fluorinated methyl-arenes and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-aryl imines (benzylidene anilines) in a cyclocondensation that is mediated by potassium hexamethyldisilazide (KHMDS) as base exclusively. This transition-metal-free process via C&#8722;H and C&#8722;F bond activation provides a one-step entry into a wide array of indoline scaffolds (43 examples, up to 96&#8201;% yield). This privileged substructure is common in natural products and pharmaceuticals alike, and cannot be accessed by traditional condensation reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Visible&#8208;Light Regulated ATP Transport in Retinal&#8208;Modified Pillar[6]arene Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Self&#8208;Assembled Sub&#8208;Nanochannel</title>

         <dc:description>
Inspired by natural visible light&#8208;responsive protein channels, we have developed the visible light response of retinal modified pillar[6]arenes assembled sub&#8208;nanoscale channel to regulate ATP transport. With visible light irradiation, the isomerization of retinal induced the close of pillar[6]arene's channel to restrain the ATP transport. Without visible light irradiation, ATP can be selectively transported in sub&#8208;nanochannel. This result is better for understanding similar biological processes from the sub&#8208;nanoscale level.







Abstract
Natural light&#8208;responsive rhodopsins play a critical role in visual conversion, signal transduction, energy transmission, etc., which has aroused extensive interest in the past decade. Inspired by these gorgeous works of living beings, scientists have constructed various biomimetic light&#8208;responsive nanochannels to mimic the behaviors of rhodopsins. However, it is still challenging to build stimuli&#8208;responsive sub&#8208;nanochannels only regulated by visible light as the rhodopsins are always at the sub&#8208;nanometer level and regulated by visible light. Pillar[6]arenes have an open cavity of 6.7&#8197;&#197;, which can selectively recognize small organic molecules. They can be connected to ions of ammonium or carboxylate groups on the rims. Therefore, we designed and synthesized the amino and carboxyl&#8208;derived side chains of pillar[6]arenes with opposite charges. The sub&#8208;nanochannels were constructed through the electrostatic interaction of layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer self&#8208;assembled amino and carboxyl&#8208;derived pillar[6]arenes. Then, the natural chromophore of the retinal with visible light&#8208;responsive performance was modified on the upper edge of the sub&#8208;nanochannel to realize the visible light switched on and off. Finally, we successfully constructed a visible light&#8208;responsive sub&#8208;nanochannel, providing a novel method for regulating the selective transport of energy&#8208;donating molecules of ATP.

         <title>Indium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Haloalkynylation Reaction of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 37, July 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using main group halides as catalysts for the Haloalkynylation reaction enables the application of various haloacetylenes. By means of several experiments and quantum chemical calculations, two different reaction pathways can be proposed.







Abstract
Green chemistry strives for sustainability at the molecular level and is gaining increasing relevance in the development of chemical reactions. The haloalkynylation reaction is a highly atom&#8211;economical C&#8722;C coupling reaction that was previously only achieved using transition metal catalysts. It enables the introduction of an alkyne unit and a halogen atom into the target molecule. Herein, we present a haloalkynylation reaction catalyzed by indium(III) halides. The use of indium(III) bromide as a catalyst leads exclusively to the cis addition products with yields up to 86&#8201;%. In addition, iodoacetylenes can be applied for the first time for the haloalkynylation reaction of internal alkynes which is an important step forward in the development of industrially relevant and sustainable catalysts. In contrast to gold catalysis, which proceeds via a similar mechanism, the use of alkyl&#8208;substituted haloacetylenes as reagents is also possible. Based on 13C labeling experiments and quantum chemical calculations, we postulate two possible mechanisms for the indium(III)&#8208;catalyzed haloalkynylation reactions.

         <title>Ring Fusion Elevates the Electronic Mobility of Azabenzannulated Perylene Diimide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 37, July 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ortho five&#8208;membered ring&#8208;fused azabenzannulated perylene diimide (AzaBPDI) is synthesized by intramolecular C&#8722;H arylation cyclization. The ring&#8208;fused AzaBPDI derivative exhibits planar configuration and superior electronic mobility in organic field&#8208;effect transistor (OFET) devices in comparison to the parent non&#8208;fused one. This result provides a robust design strategy for achieving high&#8208;performance AzaBPDI derivatives.







Abstract
The backwardness of n&#8208;type organic semiconductors still exists compared with the p&#8208;type counterparts. Thus, the development of high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type organic semiconductors is of great importance for organic electronic devices and their integrated circuits. In recent years, azabenzannulated perylene diimide (PDI), as one of immense bay&#8208;region&#8208;annulated PDI derivatives, has drawn considerable attentions. However, the electronic mobilities of azabenzannulated PDI derivatives are barely satisfactory. In this contribution, the peripheral benzene ring in azabenzannulated PDI 2 was fused to the ortho position by intramolecular C&#8722;H arylation cyclization. This endows the resultant azabenzannulated PDI 4 a planar configuration as well as electron deficient pentagonal ring. As a result, the electronic mobility of 4 is almost two orders of magnitude higher than that of the nonfused azabenzannulated PDI 2. This work shall pave a new avenue in elevating the performance of azabenzannulated PDI in organic electronics.

         <title>Kinetic Trapping of an Out&#8208;of&#8208;Equilibrium Dynamic Library of Imines by Changing Solvent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 37, July 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
When an Activated Carboxylic Acid (ACA) is employed to perturb a dynamic library of imines, the nature of the solvent has a crucial role in defining the non&#8208;equilibrium state of such library. A dissipative dynamic library in CD2Cl2, fully coupled with the decarboxylation of the ACA, or a kinetically trapped out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium dynamic library in CD3CN can be generated.







Abstract
A well&#8208;behaved dynamic library composed of two imines and corresponding amines was subjected to the action of an activated carboxylic acid (ACA), whose decarboxylation is known to be base promoted, in different solvents, namely CD2Cl2, CD3CN, and mixtures of them. Two non&#8208;equilibrium systems are consequently obtained: i)&#8197;a dissipative (CD2Cl2) and ii)&#8197;an out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium (CD3CN) dynamic library whose composition goes back to equilibrium after a given time. In the former case, the library is fully coupled with the decarboxylation of the ACA, while in the latter, an energy ratchet operates. In the mixed solvents, the library exhibits a mediated behavior. Interestingly, in the presence of an excess of added ACA, the different behavior of the imine library in the two solvents is expected to manifest only when the excess acid is consumed.

         <title>Synthesis of 1,3&#8208;Dibromopyrene as Precursor of 1&#8208;, 3&#8208;, 6&#8208;, and 8&#8208;Substituted Long&#8208;Axially Symmetric Pyrene Derivatives</title>

         <dc:description>
Efficient synthesis of 1,3&#8208;dibromopyrene from 1&#8208;methoxypyrene was achieved with an overall yield of 71&#8201;%. This compound was successfully converted into 13OPA, a long&#8208;axially symmetric pyrene dye with electron donor&#8211;acceptor groups, which exhibits photophysical properties markedly distinct from those of its point&#8208;symmetric and short&#8208;axially symmetric isomers. These findings are valuable for the development of novel pyrene&#8208;based emitting materials.







Abstract
Pyrene derivatives bearing substituents at positions 1, 3, 6, and 8 find numerous applications, as exemplified by their use in lasers, sensors, and bioimaging probes. However, these derivatives typically have point&#8208;symmetric or short&#8208;axially symmetric structures, whereas long&#8208;axially symmetric derivatives remain underexplored because of the difficulty in obtaining their precursor, 1,3&#8208;dibromopyrene. To address this problem, we herein synthesized 1,3&#8208;dibromopyrene from 1&#8208;methoxypyrene in an overall yield (71&#8201;% over four steps) considerably exceeding those of existing methods. 1,3&#8208;Dibromopyrene was converted into 13OPA, a long&#8208;axially symmetric pyrene dye with electron&#8208;donor (alkoxy) groups at positions 1 and 3 and electron&#8208;acceptor (formyl) groups at positions 6 and 8. 13OPA exhibited photophysical properties distinct from those of its point&#8208;symmetric and short&#8208;axially symmetric isomers, featuring a broad and strongly redshifted absorption, strong fluorescence with reduced sensitivity to protic solvents, and small dipole moment change upon photoexcitation. The derivatization of 13OPA into a Schiff base and its functionalization via Lewis acid&#8208;base pairing were also demonstrated. Thus, our work expands the design scope of pyrene&#8208;based molecules, particularly those used as emitters.

         <title>Cold Pressing of Perovskite&#8208;ZIF Glass Interpenetrating Networks with Stable Photoelectric Response</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 37, July 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cold pressing synthesis: The (agZIF&#8208;62)0.5(CsPbBr3)0.5 composite material is prepared using a ball milling and cold pressing technique. The interpenetrating network of perovskite&#8208;ZIF glass within the composite material contributes to enhanced fluorescent emission and lifetime. The optoelectronic device fabricated from this composite material exhibits excellent air stability, retaining 97.6&#8201;% of the initial current after 2000&#8197;hours.







Abstract
The protection of lead halide perovskite within a stable matrix normally leads to the loss of semiconducting properties. Here, we report the synthesis of perovskite&#8208;ZIF glass interpenetrating networks via a cold pressing method, which allows the advantages of bright photoluminescence, high photoconductivity and environmental stability. This hybrid architecture has provided a novel design strategy for the real&#8208;world application of perovskite&#8208;based devices.

         <title>Control over Anion Coordination on Pd(II), Cu(I), and Ag(I) with Regioisomeric Phosphine&#8208;Carboxylate Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 37, July 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of regioisomeric carboxylate&#8208;phosphine ligands is shown to enable control over anion coordination on Pd(II) centers. Palladium(II) carboxylates are important for C&#8722;H activation and the complexes with specific orientations of the carboxylate anion or with a coordinated carboxylic acid group provide relevant coordination models. Additionally, the spatial anion control can be extended to other metal centers.







Abstract
The coordination of anionic donors is involved at various stages of catalytic cycles in transition&#8208;metal catalysis, but control over the spatial positioning of anions around a metal center is a challenge in coordination chemistry. Here we show that regioisomeric phosphine&#8208;carboxylate ligands provide spatial anion control on palladium(II) centers by favoring either &#954;2, cis&#8208;&#954;1, or trans&#8208;&#954;1 coordination of the carboxylate donor. Additionally, the palladium(II) carboxylates, which contain a methyl donor, upon protonation, deliver metal&#8208;alkyl complexes that feature a coordinated carboxylic acid. Such complexes can be considered as models for the minima that follow the concerted metalation&#8208;deprotonation transition state for C&#8722;H activation. The predictability of the coordination modes is further demonstrated on silver(I) and copper(I) centers, for which less common structures of mononuclear and dinuclear complexes can be obtained by using spatial anion control. Our results demonstrate the potential for spatial control over carboxylate anions in coordination chemistry.

         <title>Structure Engineering of Acridine Donor to Optimize Color Purity of Blue Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>

Donor engineering of dimethylacridine by incorporating fluorophenyl or trifluoromethylphenyl groups regularly shifts the fluorescence to sky blue region by 24 and 39&#8197;nm for the thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters, but keeps high external quantum efficiencies in OLEDs at 22.7&#8201;%.







Abstract
9,9&#8208;Dimethyl&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroacridine (DMAC) is one of the most widely used electron donor for constructing high&#8208;performance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters. However, DMAC&#8208;based emitters often suffer from the imperfect color purity, particularly in blue emitters, due to its strong electron&#8208;donating capability. To modulate donor strength, 2,7&#8208;F&#8208;Ph&#8208;DMAC and 2,7&#8208;CF3&#8208;Ph&#8208;DMAC were designed by introducing the electron&#8208;withdrawing 2&#8208;fluorophenyl and 2&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)phenyl at the 2,7&#8208;positions of DMAC. These donors were used, in combination with 2,4,6&#8208;triphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (TRZ) acceptor, to develop novel TADF emitters 2,7&#8208;F&#8208;Ph&#8208;DMAC&#8208;TRZ and 2,7&#8208;CF3&#8208;Ph&#8208;DMAC&#8208;TRZ. Compared to the F&#8208; or CF3&#8208;free reference emitter, both two emitters showed hypsochromic effect in fluorescence and comparable photoluminescence quantum yields without sacrificing the reverse intersystem crossing rate constants. In particular, 2,7&#8208;CF3&#8208;Ph&#8208;DMAC&#8208;TRZ based OLED exhibited a blue shift by up to 39&#8197;nm and significantly improved Commission International de l&#8242;&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates from (0.36, 0.55) to (0.22, 0.41), while the external quantum efficiency kept stable at about 22.5&#8201;%. This donor engineering strategy should be valid for improving the color purity of large amount of acridine based TADF emitters. It can be predicted that pure blue TADF emitters should be feasible if these F&#8208; or CF3&#8208;modifed acridine donors are combined with other weaker electron acceptors.

Dickerson Drew dodecamers (DDDs) with either a single (R) or (S) modified acyclic phosphate nucleotide (ZNA) at position 9 were synthesized and the influence of such modification was evaluated by NMR spectroscopy. The presence of a ZNA modification affected the hairpin&#8208;duplex interconversion of DDD DNA, with (S)&#8208;ZNA producing a more pronounced destabilizing effect on the DDD duplex structure than (R)&#8208;ZNA.







Abstract
An acyclic phosphonate&#8208;linked nucleic acid backbone (ZNA) demonstrated the capability to support duplex formation and propagate genetic information in&#8197;vivo, unveiling its potential for evolution into a synthetic genetic system (XNA). To determine the structural impact of such modification, modified Dickerson Drew DNA dodecamers (DDDs) were prepared by solid phase synthesis, each containing either an (R) or (S) isomeric form of a cytosine ZNA nucleotide. While the DDD is known to adopt a stable duplex, both duplex and hairpin forms were simultaneously observed for both modified oligonucleotides by NMR spectroscopy over a broad temperature range (5&#8211;65&#8201;&#176;C). Diffusion&#8208;ordered spectroscopy (DOSY) experiments allowed to separate duplex and hairpin signals based on the different diffusion constants of both conformational states. For the oligomer containing (R)&#8208;ZNA, only the duplex form occurred at 5&#8201;&#176;C, while it was not possible to determine by NMR a single hairpin conformation at higher temperatures. In the case of the (S)&#8208;ZNA nucleoside modified oligomer, both hairpin and duplex forms were observable at 0&#8201;&#176;C, while a single hairpin conformation was detected at 37&#8201;&#176;C, suggesting a higher destabilizing effect on dsDNA.

         <title>Plasma&#8208;Engraved Lattice&#8208;Matched NiO/NiFe2O4 Heterostructure with Ample Oxygen Vacancies for Efficient Water Electrolysis and Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A lattice&#8208;matched NiO/NiFe2O4 heterophase hybrid catalyst with ample oxygen vacancies was reported via the heterogeneous interface and defect engineering strategy. The optimized geometry/electronic structure can effectively facilitate the mass transport and charge transfer process, thereby the as&#8208;prepared catalyst shows a favorable OER performance toward efficient water splitting and Zn&#8208;air batteries.







Abstract
Heterogeneous interface and defect engineering offer effective pathways to accelerate oxygen evolution reaction (OER) charge transfer kinetics and motivate optimal intrinsic catalytic activity. Herein, we report the lattice&#8208;matched NiO/NiFe2O4 heterostructure with ample oxygen vacancies (Vo&#8208;NiO/NiFe2O4) induced by a feasible hydrothermal followed by calcination and plasma&#8208;engraving assistant technique, which shows the unique porous microflower arrangement of intertwined nanosheets. Benefitting from the synergetic effects between lattice&#8208;matched heterointerface and oxygen vacancies induce the strong electronic coupling, optimized OH&#8722;/O2 diffusion pathway and ample active sites, thus&#8208;prepared Vo&#8208;NiO/NiFe2O4 presents a favorable OER performance with a low overpotential (261&#8197;mV @ 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and small Tafel slope (39.4&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1), even surpassing commercial RuO2 catalyst. Additionally, the two&#8208;electrode configuration water electrolyzer and rechargeable zinc&#8208;air battery assembled by Vo&#8208;NiO/NiFe2O4 catalyst show the potential practical application directions. This work provides an innovative avenue for strengthening OER performance toward water electrolysis and Zn&#8208;air batteries via the interface and vacancy engineering strategy.

         <title>Polymeric Nanozyme with SOD Activity Capable of Inhibiting Self&#8208; and Metal&#8208;Induced &#945;&#8208;Synuclein Aggregation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 37, July 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional polymeric nanozyme capable to strongly coordinate CuII is designed, generating complexes with a prominent superoxide dismutase activity. Moreover, the combination of the polymeric platform with the chelator allows the nanozyme to perform its second activity: inhibition of both the self&#8208; and metal&#8208;induced aggregation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein peptides.







Abstract
Despite decades of research, Parkinson's disease is still an idiopathic pathology for which no cure has yet been found. This is partly explained by the multifactorial character of most neurodegenerative syndromes, whose generation involves multiple pathogenic factors. In Parkinson's disease, two of the most important ones are the aggregation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein and oxidative stress. In this work, we address both issues by synthesizing a multifunctional nanozyme based on grafting a pyridinophane ligand that can strongly coordinate CuII, onto biodegradable PEGylated polyester nanoparticles. The resulting nanozyme exhibits remarkable superoxide dismutase activity together with the ability to inhibit the self&#8208;induced aggregation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein into amyloid&#8208;type fibrils. Furthermore, the combination of the chelator and the polymer produces a cooperative effect whereby the resulting nanozyme can also halve CuII&#8208;induced &#945;&#8208;synuclein aggregation.

         <title>Tetrazole&#8208;Functionalized Organoboranes Exhibiting Dynamic Intramolecular N&#8594;B&#8208;Coordination and Cyanide&#8208;Selective Anion Binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 37, July 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyano&#8208;functionalities in organoboranes have been converted into tetrazoles. The chemical modification allows to tailor the Lewis&#8208;acidity of the boron center through intermolecular N&#8594;B&#8208;interaction. As a result, the compounds exhibit significantly altered physical properties, including selective binding of Cyanide over Fluoride.







Abstract
Starting from two different cyano&#8208;functionalized organoboranes, we demonstrate that 1,3&#8208;dipolar [3+2] azide&#8208;nitrile cycloaddition can serve to generate libraries of alkyl&#8208;tetrazole&#8208;functionalized compounds capable of intramolecular N&#8594;B&#8208;Lewis adduct formation. Due to the relatively low basicity of tetrazoles, structures can be generated that exhibit weak and labile N&#8594;B&#8208;coordination. The reaction furnishes 1&#8208; and 2&#8208;alkylated regio&#8208;isomers that exhibit different effective Lewis&#8208;acidities at the boron centers, and vary in their optical absorption and fluorescence properties. Indeed, we identified derivatives capable of selectively binding cyanide over fluoride, as confirmed by 11B NMR. This finding demonstrates the potentialities of this synthetic strategy to systematically fine&#8208;tune the properties of lead structures that are of interest as chemical sensors.

         <title>Tunable Optical Anisotropy in Rare&#8208;Earth Borates with Flexible [BO3] Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 37, July 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Five mixed&#8208;metal Y&#8208;based rare&#8208;earth borates have been discovered with isolated [BO3] clusters arranged in various configurations, which allows for optical anisotropy tuning between 0.024 and 0.081. This study unequivocally demonstrates that even a slight alteration to borates&#8242; anionic structure can result in a significant improvement in optical anisotropy.







Abstract
Borates have garnered a lot of attention in the realm of solid&#8208;state chemistry due to their remarkable characteristics, in which the synthesis of borates with isolated [BO3] by adding rare&#8208;earth elements is one of the main areas of structural design study. Five new mixed&#8208;metal Y&#8208;based rare&#8208;earth borates, Ba2ZnY2(BO3)4, KNa2Y(BO3)2, Li2CsY4(BO3)5, LiRb2Y(BO3)2, and RbCaY(BO3)2, have been discovered using the high&#8208;temperature solution approach. Isolated [BO3] clusters arranged in various configurations comprise their entire anionic framework, allowing for optical anisotropy tuning between 0.024 and 0.081 under 1064&#8197;nm. In this study, we characterize the relative placements of their [BO3] groups and examine how their structure affects their characteristics. The origin of their considerable optical anisotropy has been proven theoretically. This study unequivocally demonstrates that even a slight alteration to borates&#8242; anionic structure can result in a significant improvement in performance.

&lt;p&gt;Borates have garnered a lot of attention in the realm of solid-state chemistry due to their remarkable characteristics, in which the synthesis of borates with isolated [BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] by adding rare-earth elements is one of the main areas of structural design study. Five new mixed-metal Y-based rare-earth borates, Ba&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ZnY&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, KNa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Y(BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CsY&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, LiRb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Y(BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and RbCaY(BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, have been discovered using the high-temperature solution approach. Isolated [BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] clusters arranged in various configurations comprise their entire anionic framework, allowing for optical anisotropy tuning between 0.024 and 0.081 under 1064&#8197;nm. In this study, we characterize the relative placements of their [BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] groups and examine how their structure affects their characteristics. The origin of their considerable optical anisotropy has been proven theoretically. This study unequivocally demonstrates that even a slight alteration to borates&#8242; anionic structure can result in a significant improvement in performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Green chemistry is gaining increasing relevance in the development of chemical reactions. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202401070), G. Haberhauer and co&#8208;workers report the haloalkynylation reaction of various acetylenes with indium(III) bromide as a catalyst. A significant advantage of this reaction is its ability to convert both iodoacetylenes and alkyl&#8208;substituted haloacetylenes, marking progress in the development of sustainable catalysts with industrial applications.

         <title>Cover Feature: Kinetic Trapping of an Out&#8208;of&#8208;Equilibrium Dynamic Library of Imines by Changing Solvent (Chem. Eur. J. 37/2024)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 37, July 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature illustrates an activated carboxylic acid (ACA) pushing a swing in order to populate the high&#8208;energy state associated with the aromatic imine laid on the swing seat. The energy derived from the decarboxylation of the ACA is partially diverted into the imine dynamic library that is temporarily brought into an out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium state in which an aromatic imine prevails over an aliphatic imine. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Valentini, G. Ercolani, and S. Di&#8197;Stefano (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202401104).

MXenes, 2D nanomaterials constituted by alternating stacking of transition metal and carbide layers, drawn here as the fronds of a palm tree, are proposed as heterogeneous catalysts in the Concept by A. Dhakshinamoorthy, R. Ram&#237;rez&#8208;Grau, H. Garcia and A. Primo (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400576). MXenes convert indane molecules, represented as birds flying to the tree, into indanol and indanone products that are hanging on the tree as fruits. The sea and the beach highlight that the process is environmentally benign.

         <title>Oriented Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Membranes for Molecular Separations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 37, July 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses recent progress made in oriented metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) membranes for energy&#8208;efficient separation. Diverse synthetic protocols, including counter&#8208;diffusion interfacial synthesis, current&#8208;driven synthesis, and modular assembly, are systematically introduced. Furthermore, their emerging applications towards addressing environmental and industrial challenges, are highlighted.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) membranes, which are recognized as state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art platforms applied in various separation processes, have attracted widespread attention. Nonetheless, to overcome the trade&#8208;off between permeability and selectivity, which is crucial for achieving efficient separation, it is important to rationally design and manipulate MOF membrane structure. Given remarkable advances in the past decade, a timely summary of recent advancement in this field has become indispensable. This review introduces major strategies for fabricating oriented MOF membranes, including in&#8197;situ growth, contra&#8208;diffusion method, interface&#8208;assisted approach, and laminated nanosheet assembly. New insights into their updated progress and potential are elucidated. Of particular note, recent development and emerging applications of oriented MOF membranes, illustrating their potential to address environmental and energy challenges, are highlighted. Finally, remaining challenges facing their bath production and practical applications are discussed.

         <title>Defect Engineering in Bi&#8208;Based Photo/Electrocatalysts for Nitrogen Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 37, July 2, 2024. </description>

In this review, the categories, construction strategies and advanced characterization techniques of defect engineering in current Bi&#8208;based NRR catalysts are summarized, and the main challenges and opportunities for the future development of defective Bi&#8208;based NRR catalysts are discussed, providing a comprehensive theoretical guidance for this field.







Abstract
Main group Bi&#8208;based materials have gained popularity as N2 reduction reaction (NRR) photo/electrocatalysts due to their ability to inhibit competitive H2 evolution reactions (HER) and the unique N2 adsorption activities. The introduction of defects in Bi&#8208;based catalysts represents a highly effective strategy for enhancing light absorption, promoting efficient separation of photogenerated carriers, optimizing the activity of free radicals, regulating electronic structure, and improving catalytic performance. In this review, we outline the various applications of state of the defect engineering in Bi&#8208;based catalysts and elucidate the impact of vacancies on NRR performance. In particular, the types of defects, methods of defects tailoring, advanced characterization techniques, as well as the Bi&#8208;based catalysts with abundant defects and their corresponding catalytic behavior in NRR were elucidated in detail. Finally, the main challenges and opportunities for future development of defective Bi&#8208;based NRR catalysts are discussed, which provides a comprehensive theoretical guidance for this field.

         <title>Short Peptide and Amino Acid&#8208;Based Supramolecular Ionogels and Eutectogels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 37, July 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents are considered ideal choices for soft materials under environmental conditions. Understanding the self&#8208;assembly mechanisms of biological molecules, and specifically unmodified and modified peptide and amino acids, in these solvents is crucial for accelerating future research, fostering the development of innovative, bio&#8208;based soft materials.







Abstract
The capability of peptide and amino acid&#8208;based molecules to act as ionogelators and eutectogelators entrapping ionic liquids (ILs) and deep eutectic solvents (DESs) forming ionogels and eutectogels has gathered attention in recent decades. The self&#8208;assembly process, primarily driven by non&#8208;covalent interactions as hydrogen bonding, remains serendipitous in nature. This review provides a comprehensive and detailed report on self&#8208;assembly of unmodified and modified amino acids and peptides in the non&#8208;conventional solvents, ILs and DESs. Understanding these processes holds great promise for the development of innovative soft&#8208;materials, and to the progress of supramolecular systems in non&#8208;conventional solvent environments.

         <title>Heterogeneous Porous Synergistic Photocatalysts for Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 37, July 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous materials including metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent&#8211;organic frameworks (COFs), and porous organic polymers (POPs) have recently been established as an ideal platform to enhance synergistic photocatalysis for organic transformations. Benefitting from the designability of these molecular materials, both photosensitizers and catalysts can be intricately incorporated into the porous carriers, leading to greatly enhanced performance over their homogeneous counterparts.







Abstract
Recent interest has surged in using heterogeneous carriers to boost synergistic photocatalysis for organic transformations. Heterogeneous catalysts not only facilitate synergistic enhancement of distinct catalytic centers compared to their homogeneous counterparts, but also allow for the easy recovery and reuse of catalysts. This mini&#8208;review summarizes recent advancements in developing heterogeneous carriers, including metal&#8211;organic frameworks, covalent&#8211;organic frameworks, porous organic polymers, and others, for synergistic catalytic reactions. The advantages of porous materials in heterogeneous catalysis originate from their ability to provide a high surface area, facilitate enhanced mass transport, offer a tunable chemical structure, ensure the stability of active species, and enable easy recovery and reuse of catalysts. Both photosensitizers and catalysts can be intricately incorporated into suitable porous carriers to create heterogeneous dual photocatalysts for organic transformations. Notably, experimental evidence from reported cases has shown that the catalytic efficacy of heterogeneous catalysts often surpasses that of their homogeneous analogues. This enhanced performance is attributed to the proximity and confinement effects provided by the porous nature of the carriers. It is expected that porous carriers will provide a versatile platform for integrating diverse catalysts, thus exhibiting superior performance across a range of organic transformations and appealing prospect for industrial applications.

Abstract
Some nanomaterials with intrinsic protease&#8208;like activity have the advantages of good stability, biosafety, low price, large&#8208;scale preparation and unique property of nanomaterials, which are promising alternatives for natural proteases in various applications. An especial term, &#8220;nanoprotease&#8221;, has been coined to stress the intrinsic proteolytic property of these nanomaterials. As a new generation of artificial proteases, they have become a burgeoning field, attracting many researchers to design and synthesize high performance nanoproteases. In this review, we summarize recent progress on all types of nanoproteases with regard of their activity, mechanism and application and introduce a new and effective strategy for engineering high&#8208;performance nanoproteases. In addition, we discuss the challenges and opportunities of nanoprotease research in the future.

Abstract
We synthesized 2&#8208;(1&#8208;1,2&#8208;dicarbadodecaboranyl(12))&#8208;6,6,12,12&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;7,8,11,12&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;6H,10H&#8208;phenaleno[1,9&#8208;fg]pyrido[3,2,1&#8208;ij]quinoline (4), a julolidine&#8208;like pyrenyl&#8208;o&#8208;carborane, with pyrene substituted at the 2,7&#8208;positions on the HOMO/LUMO nodal plane. Using solid state molecular structures, photophysical data, cyclic voltammetry, DFT and LR&#8208;TDDFT calculations, we compare o&#8208;carborane and B(Mes)2 (Mes=2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2) as acceptor groups. Whereas the &#960;&#8208;acceptor strength of B(Mes)2 is sufficient to drop the pyrene LUMO+1 below the LUMO, the carborane does not do this. We confirm the &#960;&#8208;donor strength of the julolidine&#8208;like moiety, however, which raises the pyrene HOMO&#8208;1 above the HOMO. In contrast to the analogous pyrene&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#8208;o&#8208;carborane, 2&#8208;(1&#8208;1,2&#8208;dicarbadodecaboranyl(12))&#8208;pyrene VI, which exhibits dual fluorescence, because the rate of internal conversion between locally&#8208;excited (LE) and charge transfer (CT) (from the pyrene to the carborane) states is faster than the radiative decay rate, leading to a thermodynamic equilibrium between the 2 states, 4 shows only single fluorescence, as the CT state involving the carborane as the acceptor moiety in not kinetically accessible, so a more localized CT emission involving the julolidine&#8208;like pyrene moiety is observed.

         <title>Asymmetric Carbene Transfer: Enhancing Chemical Diversity for Drug Discovery</title>

Asymmetric carbene transfer reactions increase molecular diversity for drug discovery.







Abstract
The quest to explore chemical space is vital for identifying novel disease targets, impacting both the effectiveness and safety profile of therapeutic agents. The tangible chemical space, currently estimated at a conservative 108 synthesized compounds, pales in comparison to the theoretically conceivable diversity of 1060 molecules. To bridge this vast gap, organic chemists are spearheading innovative methodologies that promise to broaden this limited chemical diversity. A beacon of this progressive wave is Asymmetric Carbene Transfer (ACT), a burgeoning strategy that significantly boosts molecular diversity with efficient bond&#8208;formation and precise chiral control. This review focuses on the capabilities of ACT in creating pharmaceutically significant molecules, encompassing an array of natural products and bioactive compounds. Through the lens of ACT, we discern its substantial influence on drug discovery, paving the way for novel therapeutic avenues by expanding the boundaries of molecular diversity. This review will shed light on prospective methodological developments of ACT and articulate their conceivable contributions to the medicinal chemistry arena.

A beacon of this progressive wave is Asymmetric Carbene Transfer (ACT), a burgeoning strategy that significantly boosts molecular diversity with efficient bond-formation and precise chiral control. This review focuses on the capabilities of ACT in creating pharmaceutically significant molecules, encompassing an array of natural products and bioactive compounds. Through the lens of ACT, we discern its substantial influence on drug discovery, paving the way for novel therapeutic avenues by expanding the boundaries of molecular diversity. This review will shed light on prospective methodological developments of ACT and articulate their conceivable contributions to the medicinal chemistry arena.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polyarylene&#8208;Based Anion Exchange Membranes for Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyarylene&#8208;based anion exchange membranes feature ether&#8208;free, high molecular weight, and high pKa aromatic polymer networks. Designing strategies, including balancing rigid and flexible segments in the backbone, installing side chains for flexibility and ion conduction, and mechanical stabilization through crosslinking, can realize long&#8208;term durable power generation from the assembled fuel cells.







Abstract
Anion exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC) is an emerging and promising technology that can help realize a carbon&#8208;neutral, sustainable economy. Also, compared to the proton exchange membrane counterpart, AEMFC can achieve comparable cell outputs with lower costs due to the applicability of non&#8208;platinum group metal electrocatalysts for the reaction on the electrodes&#8217; surfaces. However, the wide application of the AEMFCs has been impeded by the unsatisfactory stability and performance of the hydroxide&#8208;conductive membranes in the past. Recently researchers have made breakthroughs using polyarylene (PA)&#8208;based AEMs. This article summarizes the recent advances of a class of AEMs with aromatic backbone without ether bonds, mainly synthesized by Friedel&#8211;Crafts polycondensation. Such PA&#8208;based AEMs showed high chemical/mechanical stabilities and ionic conductivity, and even the fuel cell with those AEMs showed impressive peak power density of up to 2.58&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In this concept article, we classify major strategies for making PA&#8208;based AEMs to show the recent trends, highlight synthesis, characterization, and properties, and provide a brief outlook.

         <dc:description>
The TEMPO/air double&#8208;mediated BiBrO&#8211;photocatalyzed semi&#8208;heterogeneous decarboxylative phosphorylation of N&#8208;arylglycines with diarylphosphine oxides was developed. Various &#945;&#8208;amino phosphinoxides can be efficiently synthesized.







Abstract
With both TEMPO and O2 (in air) as the homogeneous redox mediators, BiBrO as the heterogeneous semiconductor photocatalyst, the first example of semi&#8208;heterogeneous photocatalytic decarboxylative phosphorylation of N&#8208;arylglycines with diarylphosphine oxides was established. A series of &#945;&#8208;amino phosphinoxides were efficiently synthesized.

         <title>Nature Products Chlorophyll Derivatives for NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence Bioimaging and Plant&#8208;Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chlorophyll, the most well&#8208;known natural product, has applications in a variety of fields, and we have applied it to NIR&#8208;II imaging for the first time, and the results show that it has great potential in plant and biological research.







Abstract
The second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) fluorescence imaging has attracted significant attention in research fields because of its unique advantages compared with conventional optical windows (400&#8211;900&#8197;nm). A variety of NIR&#8208;II fluorophores have been actively studied because they serve as a key component of fluorescence imaging. Among them, organic small molecule NIR&#8208;II fluorophores display outstanding imaging performance and many advantages, but types of small molecule NIR&#8208;II fluorophores with high biocompatibility are still quite limited. Novel molecular scaffolds based NIR&#8208;II dyes are highly desired. Herein, we hypothesized that chlorophyll is a new promising molecular platform for discovery NIR&#8208;II fluorophores. Thus, seven derivatives of derivatives were selected to characterize their optical properties. Interestingly, six chlorophyll derivatives displayed NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging capability. This characteristic allowed the successful NIR&#8208;II imaging of green leaves of various plants. Furthermore, most of these fluorophores showed capacity to monitor viscosity change because of their sensitive for viscosity. For demonstration of its biomedical applications, these probes were successfully used for NIR&#8208;II fluorescence&#8208;guided surgical resection of lymph nodes. In summary, chlorophylls are novel valuable tool molecules for NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging and have potential to expand their applications in biomedical field and plant science.

         <title>Enhancing Substrate Channeling with Multi&#8208;Enzyme Architectures in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In Situ encapsulation of multi&#8208;enzymes in hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework was studied for Enhanced Substrate Channelling. The channel like porous structures within HOF facilitated the direct transfer of intermediates between GOx and HRP enzymes resulting in perfect substrate channeling with transient time close to 0&#8197;s. These HOF based structures also acted as protective barrier to preserve enzymes catalytic activity at extreme conditions prevalent at industrial processes.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOF) represent an emerging category of organic structures with high crystallinity and metal&#8208;free, which are not commonly observed in alternative porous organic frameworks. These needle&#8208;like porous structure can help in stabilizing enzymes and allow transfer of molecules between enzymes participating in cascade reactions for enhanced substrate channelling. Herein, we systematically synthesized and investigated the stability of HOF at extreme conditions followed by one&#8208;pot encapsulation of single and bi&#8208;enzyme systems. Firstly, we observed HOF to be stable at pH&#8197;1 to 14 and at high temperatures (up to 115&#8201;&#176;C). Secondly, the encapsulated glucose oxidase enzyme (GOX) showed 80&#8201;% and 90&#8201;% of its original activity at 70&#8201;&#176;C and pH&#8197;11, respectively. Thirdly, transient time close to 0&#8197;seconds was observed for HOF encapsulated bi&#8208;enzyme cascade reaction system demonstrating a 4.25&#8208;fold improvement in catalytic activity when compared to free enzymes with enhanced substrate channelling. Our findings showcase a facile system synthesized under ambient conditions to encapsulate and stabilize enzymes at extreme conditions.

         <title>Synthesis and Structure of the Small Superelectrophile [C2(OH)2Me2]2+</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This house of cards is a fragile construct that can collapse if the wrong move is made. Similarly, the stability of the small superelectrophile [C2(OH)2Me2]2+ is a fragile equilibrium that is delicately balanced by donor&#8211;acceptor interactions. Too much fluoride leads to superelectrophilic reactions, while too little fluoride means missing stabilization of the C2h structure. More information on how this balance is achieved can be found in the Research Article by A.&#8197;J. Kornath and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400354).

         <title>Selective Transition Enhancement in a g&#8208;Engineered Diradical</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric diradical was synthesized by grafting a nitroxide radical onto the [Y(Pc)2]&#8901; radical system. The molecule was shown to exhibit a weak exchange interaction between its two radical units. The g&#8208;asymmetry combined with the magnetic interaction led to the electron paramagnetic resonance transition of different tipping angles, which could be selectively enhanced by proper choice of applied magnetic field and microwave power. More information can be found in the Research Article by A.&#8197;K. Boudalis, A. Mizuno, M. Ruben and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400420).

         <title>The Influence of Disulfide, Thioacetal and Lanthionine&#8208;Bridges on the Conformation of a Macrocyclic Peptide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclisation of peptides by forming thioether (lanthionine), disulfide (cystine) or methylene thioacetal bridges between side chains is established as an important tool to stabilise a given structure, enhance metabolic stability and optimise both potency and selectivity. However, a systematic comparative study of the effects of differing bridging modalities on peptide conformation has not previously been carried out. In this paper, we have used the NMR deconvolution algorithm, NAMFIS, to determine the conformational ensembles, in aqueous solution, of three cyclic analogues of angiotensin(1&#8208;7), incorporating either disulfide, or non&#8208;reduceable thioether or methylene thioacetal bridges. We demonstrate that the major solution conformations are conserved between the different bridged peptides, but the distribution of conformations differs appreciably. This suggests that subtle differences in ring size and bridging structure can be exploited to fine&#8208;tune the conformational properties of cyclic peptides, which may modulate their bioactivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Mesoionic Janus&#8208;type Dicarbene: Complexes, Adducts, and Catalytic Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The preparations of homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;bimetallic complexes as well as thiourea and selenourea derivatives of a mesoionic Janus&#8208;type N&#8208;heterocyclic dicarbene (diNHC) are reported. Analogues of its monocationic intermediate NHC have also been obtained for comparison. Using the main group adducts, the &#960;&#8208;acceptor properties of both NHCs were determined using low temperature 77Se NMR spectroscopy completing their stereoelectronic profiling. Moreover, catalytic investigations reveal that the mesoionic dipalladium Janus&#8208;diNHC complex can be used in the sequential C2&#8208; and C5&#8208;arylation of 1&#8208;methylpyrrole for the preparation of non&#8208;symmetrical 2,5&#8208;diarylpyrroles.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical Initiation and Reactions of Thiyl Radicals Studied with SH2&#8217; Radical Traps</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A radical trapping method based on an SH2&#8217; homolytic substitution reaction was applied to study the mechanism of a photochemical spirocyclisation of indole&#8208;ynones in the presence of thiols. Starting material, products and a range of trapped radical intermediates were simultaneously detected in reaction mixtures by mass spectrometry (MS). The trapped intermediates included both initiating and main chain propagating radicals. These data made it possible to propose a self&#8208;initiation mechanism consistent with the originally postulated photoexcitation of an intramolecular electron donor&#8208;acceptor complex of the substrate. The effect of thiol structure on the MS peak intensity of the reaction components was rationalised in terms of the relative stability of the radical intermediates. The results were compared to a simpler related reaction, a photochemical thiol&#8208;ene addition where reagents, products and trapped intermediate radicals were also detected by MS. Relative MS peak intensities were again explained by a combination of electronic and steric effects on the stability of intermediate radicals. Overall, SH2&#8217; radical trapping was demonstrated to be a powerful experimental technique for providing mechanistic evidence on photochemical and other organic radical reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>De&#8208; and Rearomatisation of Pyridine in Silylene Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditional methods relying on metal&#8208;ligand cooperation for activating pyridine bonds in de&#8208; and rearomatisation are being challenged by the abundant metal&#8208;free element species as alternatives. Here, we investigate the de/re&#8208;aromatisation of pyridine facilitated by pyridylamino&#8208;functionalised silylene reactions with ketones and ketene. The reactivity outcome is highly dependent on the substituents on the ketones. By carefully tuning the steric demand of the ketone, each intermediate of the reaction sequence could be isolated. At room temperature, benzophenone and acetophenone substrates led to dearomatisation of the pyridine moiety, with the case of acetophenone showing an intermediate silaoxirane preceding dearomatisation. However, when subjected to acetone or diphenylketene, only silaoxiranes were formed without dearomatisation of the pyridine moiety. Notably, only benzophenone&#8208;derived dearomatised species demonstrate rearomatisation upon heating. Furthermore, the reduced steric bulk of the ketene facilitated further ring expansion with another equivalent of the substrate, forming sila&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolanes. Both steric hindrance and aromatic groups collectively influence the dearomatisation of pyridine in pyridylaminosilylene reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Monomeric Fe(III)&#8208;Hydroxo and Fe(III)&#8208;Aqua Complexes Display Oxidative Asynchronous Hydrogen Atom Abstraction Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper presents the synthesis and characterization of a series of novel monomeric aqua&#8208;ligated iron(III) complexes, [FeIII(L5R)(OH2)]2+ (R = OMe, H, Cl, NO2), supported by an amide&#8208;containing pentadentate N5 donor ligand, L5R [HL5R = 2&#8208;(((1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methyl)(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#8208;methyl)amino)&#8208;N&#8208;(5&#8208;R&#8208;quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)acetamide]. The complexes were characterized by various spectroscopic and analytical techniques, including electrochemistry and magnetic measurements. The Fe(III)&#8208;hydroxo complexes, [FeIII(L5R)(OH)]1+, were generated in situ by deprotonating the corresponding aqua complexes in a pH ~7 aqueous medium. In another way, adding one equivalent of a base to a methanolic solution of the Fe(III)&#8208;aqua complexes also produced the Fe(III)&#8208;hydroxo complexes. The study uses linoleic fatty acid as a substrate to explore the hydrogen atom abstraction (HAA) reactivity of both hydroxo&#8208; and aqua&#8208;complexes. The investigation highlights the substitution effect of the L5R ligand on reactivity, revealing a higher rate when an electron&#8208;withdrawing group is present. Hammett analyses and(or) determination of the asynchronicity factor (&#951;) suggest an oxidative asynchronous concerted proton&#8208;electron transfer (CPET) pathway for the HAA reactions. Aqua complexes exhibited a higher asynchronicity in CPET, resulting in higher reaction rates than their hydroxo analogues. Overall, the work provides insights into the beneficial role of a higher imbalance in electron&#8208;transfer&#8208;proton&#8208;transfer (ET&#8208;PT) contributions in HAA reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Gas Delivery Relevant to Human Health using Porous Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gases are essential for various applications relevant to human health, including in medicine, biomedical imaging, and pharmaceutical synthesis. However, gases are significantly more challenging to safely handle than liquids and solids. Herein, we review the use of porous materials, such as metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), zeolites, and silicas, to adsorb medicinally relevant gases and facilitate their handling as solids.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Gases are essential for various applications relevant to human health, including in medicine, biomedical imaging, and pharmaceutical synthesis. However, gases are significantly more challenging to safely handle than liquids and solids. Herein, we review the use of porous materials, such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), zeolites, and silicas, to adsorb medicinally relevant gases and facilitate their handling as solids. Specific topics include the use of MOFs and zeolites to deliver H2S for therapeutic applications, 129Xe for magnetic resonance imaging, O2 for the treatment of cancer and hypoxia, and various gases for use in organic synthesis. This Perspective aims to bring together the organic, inorganic, medicinal, and materials chemistry communities to inspire the design of next-generation porous materials for the storage and delivery of medicinally relevant gases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design, Synthesis, and Photophysical Characterization of Biocompatible Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Carbazole&#8208;Coumarins for Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of fluorescent carbazole&#8208;coumarins exhibiting good photoluminescence quantum yields and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties have been designed and synthetized using computer&#8208;aided density functional theory calculations. The TADF characteristics of the carbazole&#8208;coumarins were systematically explored both in solution and in the solid state, utilizing poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) as a matrix. The study revealed that the introduction of carbazole units onto the coumarin benzene ring led to compounds with thermally induced reverse intersystem crossing and delayed fluorescence. The study further demonstrated the potential utility of these compounds in practical applications by incorporating them into a Cmr&#8208;PMMA&#8208;based sensor for molecular oxygen detection. The resulting sensor exhibited promising performance, highlighting the adaptability and efficacy of the synthesized TADF&#8208;carbazole&#8208;coumarin compounds for reversible molecular oxygen sensing.</dc:description>

         <title>Three Perovskite Phases with Different Cation Orders in Sm2MnMn(Mn4&#8722;xSbx)O12</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cation orders in both A and B sites can be controlled in the Sm2MnMn(Mn4&#8722;xSbx)O12 perovskite solid solutions via aliovalent doping by Sb5+ only at B site realizing A&#8208;site columnar&#8208;ordered/B&#8208;site&#8208;disordered, A&#8208;site columnar&#8208;ordered/B&#8208;site rock&#8208;salt&#8208;ordered, and A&#8208;site&#8208;disordered/B&#8208;site rock&#8208;salt&#8208;ordered structures.







Abstract
Cation order, which can be controlled by synthesis conditions and stoichiometry, plays an important role in properties of perovskite materials. Here we show that aliovalent doping by Sb5+ in Sm2MnMn(Mn4&#8722;xSbx)O12 quadruple perovskite solid solutions can control cation orders in both A and B sites. Samples with 0.4&#8804;x&#8804;2 were synthesized by a high&#8208;pressure, high&#8208;temperature method at 6&#8197;GPa and 1770&#8197;K. Three regions with different cation orders were found at 0.5&#8804;x&#8804;1.0, x=1.5&#8211;1.6, and x=1.8. The 0.5&#8804;x&#8804;1.0 compositions have a B&#8208;site&#8208;disordered and A&#8208;site columnar&#8208;ordered structure with space group P42/nmc; the x=1.5 and 1.6 samples have a B&#8208;site rock&#8208;salt&#8208;ordered and A&#8208;site columnar&#8208;ordered structure with space group P42/n; the x=1.8 sample has a B&#8208;site rock&#8208;salt&#8208;ordered and A&#8208;site&#8208;disordered structure with space group P21/n. All the samples show one ferrimagnetic transition: TC increases from 35&#8197;K to 73&#8197;K for 0.5&#8804;x&#8804;1.0, TC=81&#8197;K for x=1.5 and 1.6, and TC=53&#8197;K for x=1.8.

         <title>Superlong Metal&#8208;organic Framework Nanowire Fabricated via Steam&#8208;assisted Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1D nanomaterials have attracted great attention due to their outstanding anisotropic and linear structures. A facile method is developed to fabricate 1D copper metal&#8208;organic framework nanowires (Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;NW) through steam&#8208;assisted conversion from Cu&#8208;MOF precursors. During the steam&#8208;assisted conversion, Cu&#8208;MOF precursor gradually dissolves in methanol steam, and then recrystallized into Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;NW, which shows high aspect ratio of about 600 and identical crystal structure of MOF&#8208;74. As&#8208;prepared Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;NW with multiscale porous structure can effectively remove cationic dyes even in dye mixture. Moreover, Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;NW, as an ideal template, is calcined to form Cu nanoparticle&#8208;doped carbon nanofiber with maintaining its 1D morphology, which shows excellent electrocatalytic activity for the non&#8208;enzymatic sensing of glucose.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust, Reproducible, and Scalable Synthesis of Silver Nanocubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;airtight setup for achieving robust, reproducible, and scalable production of Ag nanocubes with uniform and controlled sizes from 18 to 60&#8197;nm was developed. Different from the conventional open&#8208;to&#8208;air setup, the self&#8208;airtight system makes it practical to stabilize the reaction condition by minimizing the loss of volatile reagents, allowing for the production of Ag nanocubes at gram quantities without sacrificing uniformity, corner/edge sharpness, controlled size, and high purity across different batches.







Abstract
It remains a challenge to accomplish colloidal synthesis of noble&#8208;metal nanocrystals marked by high quality, large quantity, and batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch consistency. Here we report a self&#8208;airtight setup for achieving robust, reproducible, and scalable production of Ag nanocubes with uniform and controlled sizes from 18 to 60&#8197;nm. Different from the conventional open&#8208;to&#8208;air setup, the self&#8208;airtight system makes it practical to stabilize the reaction condition by minimizing the loss of volatile reagents. The new setup also allows us to easily optimize the amount of O2 (from air) trapped in the system, ensuring burst nucleation of single&#8208;crystal seeds, followed by their slow growth into nanocubes. Most significantly, the new setup allows for the production of Ag nanocubes at gram quantities without sacrificing uniformity, corner/edge sharpness, controlled size, and high purity across different batches. The availability of high&#8208;quality Ag nanocubes in such a large quantity is anticipated to substantially boost their use in applications related to plasmonics, catalysis, and biomedicine.

The availability of high-quality Ag nanocubes in such a large quantity is anticipated to substantially boost their use in applications related to plasmonics, catalysis, and biomedicine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reactivity of a Neutral Yttrium(III) Trimethyl Complex toward Br&#248;nsted and Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 9&#8208;membered azacrown Me3TACN offers a versatile platform for examining multiple Y&#8722;Me reactivity/conversion. Neither steric pressure nor nitrophilic substrates favor displacement of Me3TACN, marking its suitability for assessing ligand class&#8208;dependent incremental 89Y NMR chemical shifts.







Abstract
The present study corroborates that the neutral tridentate N&#8208;ligand 1,4,7&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;triazacyclononane (Me3TACN) qualifies as a versatile platform to study selective ligand exchange with rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal alkyl complexes, herein [(Me3TACN)YMe3]. Treatment with Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acidic bis(dimethylsilyl)amine, HN(SiHMe2)2, gave selectively the mono&#8208;exchanged heteroleptic complex [(Me3TACN)YMe2{N(SiHMe2)2}]. Depending on the molecular ratio employed, the reaction of [(Me3TACN)YMe3] with AlMe3 resulted in the isolation/crystallization of [(Me3TACN)YMe2(AlMe4)] [1&#8201;:&#8201;1] or ion&#8208;separated [(Me3TACN)YMe(AlMe4)][AlMe4] [1&#8201;:&#8201;2] and [(Me3TACN)YMe(AlMe4)][Al2Me7] [1&#8201;:&#8201;3]. Analogous reactions with the heavier group 13 methyls GaMe3 and InMe3 generated mixed methyl/tetramethylgallato complex [(Me3TACN)YMe2(GaMe4)] and ion&#8208;separated [{(Me3TACN)YMe2}2{&#956;&#8208;Me}][InMe4]. Finally, dimethylalane, HAlMe2, converted [(Me3TACN)YMe3] into heteroaluminate [(Me3TACN)Y(HAlMe3)3], representing an AlMe3&#8208;supported, molecular yttrium trihydride complex. All compounds were investigated by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD), homo&#8208; and heteronuclear (13C, 27Al, 89Y, 115In) NMR as well as IR spectroscopies and elemental analyses.

         <title>CoPS/Co4S3 Heterojunction with Highly Exposed Active Sites and Dual&#8208;site Synergy for Effective Hydrogen Evolution Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CoPS and hexagonal Co4S3 were constructed into heterojunctions. The strain effect and the high specific surface area fully expose the reactive active sites. The synergistic effect of the Co and S dual&#8208;site further enhance the catalytic activity. The catalyst has overpotentials of 61 and 70&#8197;mV to attain a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in acidic and alkaline media, respectively.







Abstract
Cobalt phosphosulphide (CoPS) has recently been recognized as a potentially effective electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, there have been no research on the design of CoPS&#8208;based heterojunctions to boost their HER performance. Herein, CoPS/Co4S3 heterojunction was prepared by phosphating treatment based on defect&#8208;rich flower&#8208;like Co1&#8208;xS precursors. The high specific surface area of nanopetals, together with the heterojunction structure with inhomogeneous strain, exposes more active sites in the catalyst. The electronic structure of the catalyst is reconfigured as a result of the interfacial interactions, which promote the catalyst&#8216;s ability to adsorb hydrogen and conduct electricity. The synergistic effect of the Co and S dual&#8208;site further enhance the catalytic activity. The catalyst has overpotentials of 61 and 70&#8197;mV to attain a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in acidic and alkaline media, respectively, which renders it competitive with previously reported analogous catalysts. This work proposes an effective technique for constructing transition metal phosphosulfide heterojunctions, as well as the development of an efficient HER electrocatalyst.

         <title>KpsS1 Mediates the Glycosylation of Pseudaminic Acid in Acinetobacter Baumannii</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates the critical role of potential glycosyltransferase KpsS1 in the glycosylation of Pseudaminic acid (Pse) in Acinetobacter baumannii, resulting in the glycosylation of Pse to the surface CPS and proteins. Furthermore, the glycosylation of Pse influences the morphology of A. baumannii and enhances the virulence potential of the bacterium in a mouse model.







Abstract
Pseudaminic acid (Pse) is found in the polysaccharide structures of the cell surface of various Gram&#8208;negative pathogenic bacteria including Acinetobacter baumannii and considered as an important component of cell surface glycans including oligosaccharides and glycoproteins. However, the glycosyltransferase that is responsible for the Pse glycosylation in A. baumannii remains unknown yet. In this study, through comparative genomics analysis of Pse&#8208;positive and negative A. baumannii clinical isolates, we identified a potential glycosyltransferase, KpsS1, located right downstream of the Pse biosynthesis genetic locus. Deletion of this gene in an Pse&#8208;positive A. baumannii strain, Ab8, impaired the glycosylation of Pse to the surface CPS and proteins, while the gene knockout strain, Ab8&#916;kpsS1, could still produce Pse with 2.86 folds higher amount than that of Ab8. Furthermore, impairment of Pse glycosylation affected the morphology and virulence potential of A. baumannii, suggesting the important role of this protein. This study will provide insights into the further understanding of Pse in bacterial physiology and pathogenesis.

         <title>A &#946;&#8208;Glucosyl Sterol Probe for in&#8197;situ Fluorescent Labelling in Neuronal Cells to Investigate Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aiming at tackling neurodegenerative diseases, the potential effect of &#946;&#8208;glucosyl sterol on neuronal cells is investigated by means of fluorescent labelling of a synthetic derivative. Marked differences in neuron accumulation, metabolism, and impact on the lysosomes with respect to the un&#8208;glycosylated cholesterol derivative were observed.







Abstract
A &#946;&#8208;glucosyl sterol probe bearing a terminal alkyne moiety for fluorescent tagging enables the investigation of the neuronal and intracellular localization of this class of compounds involved in neurodegenerative diseases. The compound showed localization in the neuronal cells, with marked differences in the uptake and metabolism leading to enhanced persistence with respect to the un&#8208;glycosylated sterol analogue. In addition, a different impact was observed towards lysosomes, with the simple sterol probe showing the enlargement of the lysosome structures, while the &#946;&#8208;glucosyl sterol was less capable to alter the morphology of this specific organelle.

         <title>Expedited Proton Relay in Enzyme&#8208;Inspired Cobaloximes Facilitates Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing a water&#8208;soluble, oxygen&#8208;tolerant, and acid&#8208;stable synthetic H2 production catalyst is vital for renewable energy infrastructure. To access such an effective catalyst, we strategically incorporated enzyme&#8208;inspired, multicomponent outer coordination sphere elements around the cobaloxime (Cl&#8211;Co&#8211;X) core with suitable axial coordination (X). Our cobaloximes with axial imidazole or L&#8208;histidine coordination in photocatalytic HAT including the construction of anilines via a non&#8208;canonical cross&#8208;coupling approach is found superior compared to commonly used cobaloxime catalysts. The reversible Co(II)/Co(I) process is influenced by the axial N ligand's nature. Imidazole/ L&#8208;histidine with a higher pKa promptly produces H2 upon irradiation, leading to the improved reactivity compared to previously employed axial (di)chloride or pyridine analogue.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving Non&#8208;Interfacial Blocking Zinc Ion Transport Based on MOF Derived Manganese Oxides and Amorphous Carbon Hybrid Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>How to coordinate electron and ion transport behavior across scales and interfaces within ion battery electrodes? The exponential increase in surface area observed in nanoscale electrode materials results in an incomprehensibly vast spatial interval. Herein, to address the problems of volume expansion, dissolution of cathode material, and the charge accumulation problem existing in manganiferous materials for zinc ion batteries, metal organic framework is utilized to form the architecture of non&#8208;interfacial blocking ~10 nm Mn2O3 nanoparticles and amorphous carbon hybrid electrode materials, demonstrating a high specific capacity of 361 mAh g&#8208;1 (0.1 A g&#8208;1), and excellent cycle stability of 105 mAh g&#8208;1 after 2000 cycles under 1 A g&#8208;1. The uniform and non&#8208;separated disposition of Mn and C atoms constitutes an interconnected network with high electronic and ionic conductivity, minimizing issues like structural collapse and volume expansion of the electrode material during cycling. The cooperative insert mechanism of H+ and Zn2+ are analyzed via ex&#8208;situ XRD and in&#8208;situ Raman tests. The model battery is assembled to present practical possibilities. The results indicate that MOF&#8208;derived carbonization provides an effective strategy for exploring Mn&#8208;based electrode materials with high ion and electron transport capacity.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA Hierarchical Superstructures from Micellar Units: Stiff Hydrogels and Anisotropic Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular materials have been assembled using a wide range of interactions, including the hydrophobic effect, DNA base&#8208;pairing, and hydrogen bonding. Specifically, DNA amphiphiles with a hydrophobic building block self&#8208;assemble into diverse morphologies depending on the length and composition of both blocks. Herein, we take advantage of the orthogonality of different supramolecular interactions &#8211; the hydrophobic effect, Watson&#8208;Crick&#8208;Franklin base pairing and RNA kissing loops &#8211; to create hierarchical self&#8208;assemblies with controlled morphologies on both the nanometer and the micrometer scales. Assembly through base&#8208;pairing leads to the formation of hybrid, multi&#8208;phasic hydrogels with high stiffness and self&#8208;healing properties. Assembly via hydrophobic core interactions gives anisotropic, discrete assemblies, where DNA fibers with one sequence are terminated with DNA spheres bearing different sequences. This work opens new avenues for the bottom&#8208;up construction of DNA&#8208;based materials, with promising applications in drug delivery, tissue engineering, and the creation of complex DNA structures from a minimum array of components.</dc:description>

         <title>Click Synthesis of Tweezer Dyads for H&#8208;Bond Assisted Cooperativity in Tandem Uncaging Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: &#8220;Tandem&#8221; uncaging systems, in which a photolabile protecting group (PPG) is sensitized by an energy&#8208;harvesting antenna, may increase the photosensitivity of PPGs by several orders of magnitude for two&#8208;photon (2P) photorelease. Yet, they remain poorly accessible because of arduous multi&#8208;step synthesis. In this work, we design efficient tandem uncaging systems by (i) using a convenient assembly of the building blocks relying on click chemistry, (ii) H&#8208;bonding induced proximity thus facilitating (iii) photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) as a cooperative mechanism. A strong two&#8208;photon absorber electron&#8208;donating quadrupolar antenna and various electron&#8208;accepting PPGs (mDEAC, MNI or MDNI) were clicked stepwise onto a &#8220;tweezer&#8208;shaped&#8221; pyrido&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxylate platform whose H&#8208;bonding and p&#8208;stacking abilities were exploited to keep the antenna and the PPGs in close proximity. The different electron acceptor ability of the PPGs led to dyads with wildly different behaviors. Whilst the MDNI and MNI dyads showed poor dark stability or no photo&#8208;uncaging ability due to their too high electron accepting character, the mDEAC dyad benefited from optimum redox potentials to promote PeT and slow down charge recombination, resulting in enhanced uncaging quantum yield (Fu=0.38) compared to mDEAC (Fu=0.014). The unique resulted in large 2P photo&#8208;sensitivity in the near&#8208;infrared window (240 GM at 710 nm).</dc:description>

         <title>Contact Electrification as an Emerging Strategy for Controlling the Performance of Metal Nanoparticle Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Contact electrification (CE) is an emerging strategy for controlling the performance of metal nanoparticle (NP) catalysts. The underlying physical principle of this control is the sensitivity of the Fermi level to metal&#8208;metal contacts. This change in electronic structure has a direct impact on surface properties and chemical reactivity. The concept article briefly introduces the basic theory of CE and its relationship to catalytic performance. We then highlight selected recent examples of advances in the preparation of hybrid metal NP assemblies, experimental techniques for characterizing CE, and finally applications of CE for altering catalytic performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Wittig Reaction in Deep Eutectic Solvents: Expanding the DES Toolbox in Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Wittig reaction between substituted phosphonium salts and (hetero)aromatic and alkyl carbonyl compounds in Deep Eutectic Solvents has been developed under a scalable and friendly protocol. Highly efficient reactions were successfully run with a wide range of bases including organic (DBU, LiTMP, t&#8208;BuOK) and inorganic (NaOH, Na2CO3, K2CO3) ones in ChCl/Gly 1:2 (mol/mol) as solvent under mild conditions, at room temperature and under air. The proposed protocol was applied to a wide range of substrates, including (hetero)aromatic aldehydes with substituents as halogens (I, Br, Cl), EDG (alkoxy, methyl), EWG (NO2, CF3) or reactive groups as CN, esters, and ketones. Vinylic, alkynyl and cycloalkyl, alicyclic and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes can also be used. Highly electrophilic ketones gave good yields. The diastereoselectivity of the reaction is in complete agreement with the E/Z ratio observed under traditional conditions. We demonstrated that the reaction is scalable to 2 g (5 mmol) of phosphonium salt, furthermore the proposed workup protocol allows to remove TPPO without need of additional chromatographic purification.</dc:description>

         <title>The Hybridization of Polymers with Metal Oxide Clusters for the Design of Non&#8208;Fluorinated Proton Exchange Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As the key component of various energy storage and conversion devices, proton exchange membranes (PEMs) have been attracting significant interest. However, their further development is limited by the high cost of perfluorosulfonic acid polymers and the poor stability of acid&#8208;dopped non&#8208;fluorinated polymers. Recently, a new group of PEMs has been developed by hybridizing polyoxometalates (POMs), a group of super acidic sub&#8208;nanoscale metal oxide clusters, with polymers. POMs can serve simultaneously as both proton sponges and stabilizing agents, and their complexation with polymers can further improve polymers&#8217; mechanical performance and processability. Enormous efforts have been focused on studying supramolecular complexation or covalent grafting of POMs with various polymers to optimize PEMs in terms of cost, mechanical properties and stabilities. This concept summarizes recent advances in this emerging field and outlines the design strategies and application perspectives employed for using POM&#8208;polymer hybrid materials as PEMs.</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of weak organic acids as coagulants on tailoring the properties of cellulose aerogel beads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tailoring the properties of cellulose aerogel beads was investigated in the present study by using weak organic acids as coagulants. Three different weak acids were specifically chosen, acetic acid, lactic acid and citric acid. For comparative studies, a strong acid, hydrochloric acid was examined. The production of aerogel beads by conventional dropping technique was controlled and optimized for weak acids. Aerogels were characterized by density analyses, scanning electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption&#8211;desorption analysis, X&#8208;ray powder diffractometry and IR spectroscopy. In common, all the aerogel beads showed interconnected nanofibrillar network, high specific surface area, high pore volume, high porosity and meso&#8208; and macroporous structure. In particular, when the weakest acid (acetic acid) was used as coagulant in the regeneration bath, the lowest shrinkage was observed. As a result, the cellulose aerogel beads produced from acetic acid showed the highest values of specific surface area (423 m2&#183;g&#8208;1) and pore volume (3.6 cm3&#183;g&#8208;1). The porous structure can be tuned by the choice of regeneration bath having either strong acid or high concentration of weak acid. The aerogel beads were pure and showed cellulose II crystallinity. Hence this study paves an alternative path way to tailor the properties of cellulose aerogel beads.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Cross&#8208;Plane Conductance of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the cross&#8208;plane single&#8208;molecule junctions, the correlation between molecular aromaticity and conductance remained puzzling. Cross&#8208;plane break junction (XPBJ) provides new insight into understanding the role of aromaticity and conjugation to molecules on charge transport through the planar molecules. In this work, we investigated the modulation of cross&#8208;plane charge transport in pyrene derivatives by hydrogenation and substituents based on the XPBJ method that differs from those used in&#8208;plane transport. We measured the electrical conductance of the hydrogenated derivatives of the pyrenes and found that hydrogenation reduces conductance, and the fully hydrogenated molecule has the lowest conductance. Conductance of pyrene derivatives increased after substitution by both electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. By calculating, the trend in decreased conductance of hydrogenated pyrene was found to be consistent with the change in aromaticity. Electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents reduce the aromaticity of the molecule and narrow the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap, while electron&#8208;donating groups increase the aromaticity but also narrow the gap. Our work reveals the potential of fine&#8208;tuning the structure of the pyrene molecule to control the cross&#8208;plane charge transport through the single&#8208;molecule junctions.</dc:description>

         <title>U(V) Stabilization via Aliovalent Incorporation of Ln(III) into Oxo&#8208;salt Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ln(UVO2)W4O14 series are the inaugural materials to structurally integrate pentavalent uranium with rare&#8208;earth metals, featuring a unique U&#8722;Ln cation interaction. This occurs when Ln3+ ions replace Ca2+ in the crystal, they add extra positive charge, causing a charge imbalance that oxidizes uranium from U(VI) to U(V).







Abstract
Pentavalent uranium compounds are key components of uranium&#8216;s redox chemistry and play important roles in environmental transport. Despite this, well&#8208;characterized U(V) compounds are scarce primarily because of their instability with respect to disproportionation to U(IV) and U(VI). In this work, we provide an alternate route to incorporation of U(V) into a crystalline lattice where different oxidation states of uranium can be stabilized through the incorporation of secondary cations with different sizes and charges. We show that iriginite&#8208;based crystalline layers allow for systematically replacing U(VI) with U(V) through aliovalent substitution of 2+ alkaline&#8208;earth or 3+ rare&#8208;earth cations as dopant ions under high&#8208;temperature conditions, specifically Ca(UVIO2)W4O14 and Ln(UVO2)W4O14 (Ln=Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Yb). Evidence for the existence of U(V) and U(VI) is supported by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, high energy resolution X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and optical absorption spectroscopy. In contrast with other reported U(V) materials, the U(V) single crystals obtained using this route are relatively large (several centimeters) and easily reproducible, and thus provide a substantial improvement in the facile synthesis and stabilization of U(V).

         <title>Unravelling the Mechanism of CO2 Activation: Insights Into Metal&#8208;Metal Cooperativity and Spin&#8208;Orbit Coupling with {3d&#8211;4f} Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the activation of CO2 by 3d&#8211;4f catalysts, our combined DFT and ab initio calculations reveal the significance of metal&#8208;metal cooperativity and the role of spin&#8208;orbit coupling in fine&#8208;tuning catalytic efficiency.







Abstract
Converting CO2 into useful chemicals using metal catalysts is a significant challenge in chemistry. Among the various catalysts reported, transition metal lanthanide hybrid {3d&#8211;4f} complexes stand out for their superior efficiency and site selectivity. However, unlike transition metal catalysts, understanding the origin of this efficiency in lanthanides poses a challenge due to their orbital degeneracy, rendering the application of DFT methods ineffective. In this study, we employed a combination of density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio CASSCF/RASSI&#8208;SO calculations to explore the mechanism of CO2 conversion to cyclic carbonate using a 3d&#8211;4f heterometallic catalyst for the first time. This work unveils the importance of 3d and 4f metal cooperativity and the role of individual spin&#8208;orbit states in dictating the overall efficiency of the catalyst.

         <title>Rapid Access to Divergent Fused Polycycles Via One&#8208;Pot A3 Coupling and Intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of one&#8208;pot reaction and a derivation step is developed for concise construction of divergent nitrogen&#8208;containing fused polycyclic ring systems from simple starting materials, providing a rapid access to an under&#8208;explored structural space for discovery of new biological activities. The one&#8208;pot reaction combines aldehyde&#8208;alkyne&#8208;amine (A3) coupling and intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder reactions under simple, open&#8208;air conditions.

Divergent nitrogen&#8208;containing fused polycyclic ring systems are constructed from simple starting materials via a one&#8208;pot aldehyde&#8208;alkyne&#8208;amine (A3) coupling and intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder reaction. This domino reaction directly furnishes linear 5/5/5 and 5/5/6, or nonlinear 5/5/6/5, polycyclic rings containing an oxa&#8208;bridged fused 5/5 bicycle and a 1,6&#8208;enyne substructure. One&#8208;step derivation of the oxa&#8208;bridged 5/5 bicycle leads to a polyfunctionalized 5/5 bicycle with tetrahydrofuran fused back&#8208;to&#8208;back to pyrroline or a 6/5 bicycle with the hexahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;isoindole structure, while cycloisomerizing the enyne substructure adds an extra fused 5&#8208;membered ring to afford functionalized linear 5/5/5/5 or 5/5/5/5/5 fused ring systems from selected substrates. In addition, the one&#8208;pot product can be designed so that the alkyne moiety is hydroalkoxylated to form an additional heterocyle in a linear 5/5/5/6 or nonlinear 5/5/6/5/5 ring system. This diversity&#8208;oriented synthetic approach thus allows rapid access to an under&#8208;explored structural space for discovery of new biological or non&#8208;biological activities or functions.

&lt;p&gt;A combination of one-pot reaction and a derivation step is developed for concise construction of divergent nitrogen-containing fused polycyclic ring systems from simple starting materials, providing a rapid access to an under-explored structural space for discovery of new biological activities. The one-pot reaction combines aldehyde-alkyne-amine (A&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) coupling and intramolecular Diels-Alder reactions under simple, open-air conditions.

         <title>A Type of Stable Amides Behaves as Acyl Transfer Reagents upon Visible&#8208;Light Irradiation through Self&#8208;Aromatization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of stable amides is synthesized, which can react with various nucleophiles like acyl chlorides under light irradiation. This controllable switched&#8208;on reactivity hinges on a rational&#8208;designed photo&#8208;activatable masked acyl donor reagent.







Abstract
Organic molecules with light&#8208;modifiable reactivity are important in many fields because they can serve as the &#8220;switch&#8221; for light to trigger chemical processes. Herein, we disclose a new type of stable non&#8208;twisted amides, the reactivity of which can be turned on by light as acyl transfer reagents. Upon photo&#8208;activation, these amides react with various nucleophiles including amines, phenols, hydroxide, thiols, boronic acids, and alkynes either under metal&#8208;free or metal&#8208;catalysis conditions. This reactivity hinges on the design and synthesis of a photo&#8208;activatable reagent (7&#8208;nitro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dihydrophenanthridine), which undergoes self&#8208;aromatization enabled by an internal oxidant under light. This masked acyl donor group is anticipated to be useful in scenarios where light is preferred to trigger a chemical process.

         <title>A fluorescent gemcitabine prodrug that follows a nucleoside transporter&#8208;independent internalization and bears enhanced therapeutic efficacy with respect to gemcitabine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The multiplexity of cancer has rendered it the second leading cause of mortality worldwide and theragnostic prodrugs have gained popularity in recent years as a means of treatment. Theragnostic prodrugs enable the simultaneous diagnosis and therapy of tumors via high&#8208;precision real&#8208;time drug release monitoring. Herein, we report the development of the small theragnostic prodrug GF, based on the nucleoside anticancer agent gemcitabine and the fluorescent dye 5(6)&#8208;carboxyfluorescein. We have successfully demonstrated its efficient internalization in tumor cells, showing localization throughout both the early and late endocytic pathways. Its mechanism of cell internalization was evaluated, confirming its independence from nucleoside transporters. Its cellular localization via confocal microscopy revealed a clathrin&#8208;mediated endocytosis mechanism, distinguishing it from analogous compounds studied previously. Furthermore, GF exhibited stability across various pH values and in human blood plasma. Subsequently, its in vitro cytotoxicity was assessed in three human cancer cell lines (A549, U87 and T98). Additionally, its pharmacokinetic profile in mice was investigated and the consequent drug release was monitored. Finally, its in vivo visualization was accomplished in zebrafish xenotransplantation models and its in vivo efficacy was evaluated in A549 xenografts. The results unveiled an intriguing efficacy profile, positioning GF as a compelling candidate warranting further investigation.</dc:description>

         <title>Uncatalyzed Diboron Activation by a Strained Hydrocarbon: Experimental and Theoretical Study of [1.1.1]Propellane Diborylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of strained carbocyclic building blocks is relevant for Medicinal Chemistry, and methylenecyclobutanes are particularly challenging with current synthetic technology. Careful inspection of the reactivity of [1.1.1]propellane and diboron reagents has revealed that bis(catecholato)diboron (B2cat2) can produce a bis(borylated) methylenecyclobutane in a few minutes at room temperature. This reaction constitutes the first example of B&#8211;B bond activation by a special&#160;apolar hydrocarbon and also the first time that propellane is electrophilically activated by boron. Mechanistic studies including in situ NMR kinetics and DFT calculations demonstrate that the diboron moiety can be directly activated through coordination with the inverted sigma bond of propellane, and reveal that DMF is involved in the stabilization of diboronate ylide intermediates rather than the activation of the B&#8211;B bond. These results enable new possibilities for both diboron and propellane chemistry, and for further developments in the synthesis of methylenecyclobutanes based on propellane strain release.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper iodide organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials have been favored by many researchers in the field of solid&#8208;state lighting (SSL) due to their structural diversity and optical adjustability. In this paper, three isomeric copper iodide cluster hybrid materials, Cu4I6(L)2(1), Cu5I4.5Cl2.5(L)2(2) and Cu5I7(L)2) (3) (L=1&#8208;(4&#8208;methylpyrimidin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octan&#8208;1&#8208;ium), were achieved by adjusting the reaction conditions. The crystal color transit from green, yellow to orange and the internal quantum yield (IQY) increase from 57% to 88%. All three complexes have good thermal stability, good solution processability, and high quantum yield. And origin and mechanism of luminescence of complexes were further studied. This study can provide ideas and theoretical basis for the regulation of cuprous iodide cluster luminescent materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling reactions are powerful tools for carbon&#8211;heteroatom bonds formation, but typically require pre&#8208;activated carboxylic acids as substrates or heteroelectrophiles as functional groups. Herein, we present an electrochemical decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling of carboxylic acids with structurally diverse fluorine, alcohol, H2O, acid, and amine as nucleophiles. This strategy takes advantage of the ready availability of these building blocks from commercial libraries, as well as the mild and oxidant&#8208;free conditions provided by electrochemical system. This reaction demonstrates good functional&#8208;group tolerance and its utility in late&#8208;stage functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Hollow CeO2&#8208;Base Nanozyme with Self&#8208;Accelerated Cascade Reactions for Combined Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanozymes have obvious advantages in improving the efficiency of cancer treatment. However, due to the lack of tissue specificity, low catalytic efficiency, and so on, their clinical applications are limited. Herein, the nanoplatform CeO2@ICG@GOx@HA (CIGH) with self&#8208;accelerated cascade reactions is constructed. The as&#8208;prepared nanozyme shows the superior oxidase (OXD)&#8208;like, superoxide dismutase (SOD)&#8208;like, catalase (CAT)&#8208;like, and peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like activities. At the same time, under 808 nm near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation, the photodynamic and photothermal capabilities are also significantly enhanced due to the presence of indocyanine green (ICG). We demonstrate that the nanozyme CIGH can efficiently accumulate in the tumor and exhibit amplified cascade antitumor effects with negligible systemic toxicity through the combination of photodynamic therapy (PDT), photothermal therapy (PTT), chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and starvation therapy. The nanozyme prepared in this study provides a promising candidate for catalytic nanomedicines for efficient tumor therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Lyso&#8211;H2S: A Mycophenolic Acid&#8208;Derived Probe for Ultra&#8208;Low Toxicity, Intracellular H2S Detection, and Zebrafish Model Validation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In several biological processes, H2S is known to function as an endogenous gaseous agent. It is very necessary to monitor H2S and relevant physiological processes in vivo. Herein, a new type of fluorophore with a reliable leaving group allows for excited&#8208;state intramolecular transfer characteristics (ESIPT), inspired by mycophenolic acid. A morpholine ring was connected at the maleimide position to target the lysosome. Subsequently, the dinitrophenyl group known for a photoinduced electron transfer (PET) effect, was connected to allow for an effective &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; probe Lyso&#8211;H2S. Lyso&#8211;H2S demonstrated strong selectivity towards H2S, large Stokes shift (111 nm), and an incredibly low detection limit (41.8 nM). The imaging of endogenous and exogenous H2S in living cells (A549 cell line) was successfully achieved because of the specificity and ultra&#8208;low toxicity (100 % cell viability at 50 &#181;M concentration of Lyso&#8211;H2S.) Additionally, Lyso&#8211;H2S was also employed to visualize the activity of H2S in the gallbladder and intestine in a living zebrafish model. This is the first report of a fluorescent probe to track H2S sensing in specific organ systems to our knowledge.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescent Tetranuclear Copper(I) and Gold(I) Heterobimetallic Complexes: A Phosphine Acetylide Amidinate Orthogonal Ligand Framework for Selective Complexation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luminescent tetranuclear heterobimetallic complexes: Heterobimetallic CuI/AuI complexes with phosphine acetylide amidinate ligand were synthesized by using different reaction pathways. These complexes are found to be luminescent and differ in terms of ancillary ligands at AuI centre.







Abstract
The synthesis of phosphine acetylide amidinate stabilized copper(I) and gold(I) heterobimetallic complexes was achieved by reacting ligand [{Ph2PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}Li(thf)3] (Dipp=2,6&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;diisopropylphenyl) with CuCl and Au(tht))Cl, yielding the eight membered ring [{Ph2PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2Cu2] and the twelve membered ring [{Ph2PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2Au2]. {Ph2PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2Cu2] features a Cu2 unit, which is bridged by two amidinate ligands, served as a metalloligand to synthesize the heterobimetallic CuI/AuI complexes [{(AuX)Ph2PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2Cu2] (X=Cl, C6F5). In these reactions, the central ring structure is retained. In contrast, when the twelve membered ring [{Ph2PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2Au2] was reacted with CuX (X=Cl, Br, I and Mes), the reaction led to the rearrangement of the central ring structure to give [{(AuX)Ph2PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2Cu2] (X=Cl, Br, I and Mes), which feature the same the eight membered Cu2 ring as above. These compounds were also synthesized by a one&#8208;pot reaction. The luminescent heterobimetallic complexes were further investigated for their photophysical properties.

         <title>Recent Progress in Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TADF molecules featuring an efficient intersystem crossing process have become increasingly crucial and potential photosensitizers for the PDT process. This review presents the key characteristics of TADF photosensitizers for the specific requirements, such as their water dispersibility, targeting ability, activability, and two&#8208;photon excitation properties. Furthermore, future challenges and prospects of TADF photosensitizers in PDT are suggested.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a rapidly growing discipline that is expected to become an encouraging noninvasive therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. In the PDT process, an efficient intersystem crossing (ISC) process for photosensitizers from the singlet excited state (S1) to the triplet excited state (T1) is critical for the formation of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species and improvement of PDT performance. Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules featuring an extremely small singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap and an efficient ISC process represent an enormous breakthrough for the PDT process. Consequently, the development of advanced TADF photosensitizers has become increasingly crucial and pressing. The most recent developments in TADF photosensitizers aimed at enhancing PDT efficiency for bio&#8208;applications are presented in this review. TADF photosensitizers with water dispersibility, targeting ability, activatable ability, and two&#8208;photon excitation properties are highlighted. Furthermore, the future challenges and perspectives of TADF photosensitizers in PDT are proposed.

         <title>Hydrosilylation of Olefins Activated on Highly Lewis&#8208;Acidic Calcium Cation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Readily available salt of Ca2+ with weakly coordinating anion [Al(ORF)4]&#8722; (RF=C(CF3)3) exhibits high Lewis acidity comparable to SbF5. Reactivity studies show it is an effective catalyst for olefin hydrosilylation, yielding anti&#8208;Markovnikov regioisomer. Experimental and DFT studies indicate a unique mechanism for this type of reaction, which involves the activation of the olefin molecule by coordination with Ca2+.







Abstract
The report introduces simple yet highly reactive calcium salt, Ca[Al(ORF)4]2 (RF=C(CF3)3), 1, which effectively catalyses olefin hydrosilylation through an unusual mechanism involving the activation of the alkene molecule. Upon dissolution in o&#8208;difluorobenzene (oDFB), 1 forms a highly Lewis acidic [Ca(oDFB)6]2+ complex. Our DFT calculations reveal that fluoride ion affinity is comparable to SbF5. Reactivity tests show that it effectively catalyses the hydrosilylation of olefins with high regioselectivity, also in reactions involving sterically demanding substrates like (iPr)3SiH or tetrasubstituted olefins. Experimental and computational results point to the mechanism where the olefin molecule forms a complex with Ca2+, which significantly facilitates the attack of H&#8208;SiR3 on the C=C double bond.

Thermally conductive epoxies with self&#8208;healing ability will be widely used in flexible electronic materials in the future. In this paper, alkyl chains of different lengths were introduced to epoxies for discussing the thermally conductive, the self&#8208;healing performance, and the synergistic effect. and the epoxies suitable for flexible electronic device can be prepared by adjusting the length of alkyl chains.







Abstract
With the popularization of 5G technology and artificial intelligence, thermally conductive epoxies with self&#8208;healing ability will be widely used in flexible electronic materials. Although many compounds containing both performances have been synthesized, there is little systematic theory to explain the coordination mechanism. In this paper, alkyl chains of different lengths were introduced to epoxies to discuss the thermally conductive, the self&#8208;healing performance, and the synergistic effect. A series of electronic&#8208;grade biphenyl epoxies (4,4&#8242;&#8208;bis(oxiran&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethoxy)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl (1), 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;(oxiran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethoxy)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl (2), 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bis(3&#8208;(oxiran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)propoxy)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl (3), and 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bis(4&#8208;(oxiran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)butoxy)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl (4) were synthesized and characterized. Furthermore, they were cured with decanedioic acid to produce polymers. Results showed that alkyl chains can both affect the two properties, and the epoxies suitable for specific application scenarios can be prepared by adjusting the length of alkyl chains. In terms of thermal conductivity, compound 1 was a most promising material. However, compound 4 was expected to be utilized in flexible electronic devices because of its acceptable thermal conductivity, self&#8208;healing ability, transparency, and flexibility.

         <title>Tetrazole and oxadiazole derivatives as thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) are promising lighting solutions for sustainability and energy efficiency. Incorporating thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules enables OLEDs to achieve internal quantum efficiency (IQE), in principle, up to 100%; therefore, new classes of promising TADF emitters and modifications of existing ones are sought after. This study explores the TADF emission properties of six designed TADF emitters, examining their photophysical responses using experimental and theoretical methods. The design strategy involves creating six distinct types of a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) system, where tert&#8208;butylcarbazoles are used as donors, while the acceptor component incorporates three different functional groups: nitrile, tetrazole and oxadiazole, with varying electron&#8208;withdrawing character. Additionally, the donor&#8208;acceptor distance is adjusted using a phenylene spacer, and its influence on TADF functionality is examined. The clear dependency of an additional spacer, inhibiting TADF, could be revealed. Emitters with a direct donor&#8208;acceptor connection are demonstrated to exhibit TADF moderate emissive behavior. The analysis emphasizes the impact of charge transfer, singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps (&#916;EST), and other microscopic parameters on photophysical rates, permitting TADF. Among the emitters, TCz&#8208;CN shows optimal performance as a blue&#8208;green emitter with an 88% photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and fast rate of reversible intersystem crossing of 2x106 s&#8208;1</dc:description>

         <title>Prediction of Covalent Metal&#8208;Metal Bonding in Cp&#8208;M&#8208;M&#8217;&#8208;Nacnac Complexes of Group 2 and 12 Metals (Be, Mg, Ca, Zn, Cd, Hg)</title>

         <dc:description>Bimetallic CpMM'Nacnac molecules with group 2 and 12 metals (M = Be, Mg, Ca, Zn, Cd, Hg) that contain novel metal&#8208;metal bonding have been investigated in a theoretical study of their molecular and electronic structure, thermodynamic stability, and metal&#8208;metal bonding. In all cases the metal&#8208;metal bonds are characterized as electron&#8208;sharing covalent single bonds from natural bond orbital (NBO) and energy&#8208;decomposition analysis with natural orbitals of chemical valence (EDA&#8208;NOCV) analysis. The sum of [MM'] charges is relatively constant, with all complexes exhibiting a [MM']2+&#160;core. Quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) analysis indicates the presence of non&#8208;nuclear attractors (NNA) in the metal&#8208;metal bonds of the BeBe, MgMg, and CaCa complexes. There is substantial electron density (0.75&#8208;1.33 e) associated with the NNAs, which indicates that these metal&#8208;metal bonds, while classified as covalent electron&#8208;sharing bonds, retain significant metallic character that can be associated with reducing reactivity of the complex. The predicted stability of these complexes, combined with their novel covalent metal&#8208;metal bonding and potential as reducing agents, make them appealing targets for the synthesis of new metal&#8208;metal bonds.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We described a copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed atom economic and selective hydroamination&#8208;cyclization of alkynyl&#8208;tethered quinazolinones to prepare a variety of indole&#8208;fused pyrazino[1,2&#8208;a]quinazolinones in good to excellent yields ranging from 39% to 99% under mild reaction conditions. Control experiments revealed that coordination&#8208;directed method of quinazolinone moiety with copper(I) was important for the selective hydroamination&#8208;cyclization of alkynes at the N1&#8208;atom instead of N3&#8208;atom of quinazolinone. The reaction could be easily performed at gram scales and some prepared indole&#8208;fused pyrazino[1,2&#8208;a]quinazolinones with donating groups on the indole moiety showed a distinct fluorescence emission wavelength with blue shift under the acid conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Triphenylamine&#8208;based D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A Systems for Efficient&#160;Ternary Worm Memory Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The impact of various substituent moieties on the molecular framework of a conjugated D&#8208;A system in resistive switching memory property has been scrutinized through an array of novel D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A molecules. The synthesized molecules with triphenylamine (TPA) as the electron donor and dicyanovinylindanone (IC) as the electron acceptor demonstrated substantial non&#8208;volatile WORM (Write&#8208;Once Read&#8208;Many) memory behaviour with appreciable ON/OFF current ratios up to 105 and a lowest recorded threshold voltage of &#8208;0.80 V. The well&#8208;balanced combination of these potent electron donating and accepting units culminated in exceptional intramolecular charge transfer interactions and minimal band gap values (1.82&#8208;2.31 eV) for the molecules, as demonstrated by photophysical and electrochemical investigations. These factors, coupled with the thin&#8208;film morphological studies, corroborated the superior performance of the fabricated devices. A longer retention time of 2000s and an endurance of 100 cycles mark the substantial stability of the memory devices. Moreover, conversion from binary to ternary WORM memory was achieved by the effective tuning of the electronic properties of the D&#8208;A systems by various substituent moieties. Molecular simulation studies revealed that the resistive switching phenomenon arises from a synergistic interplay of charge transfer and charge trapping processes within these D&#8208;A systems.</dc:description>

Molecular simulation studies revealed that the resistive switching phenomenon arises from a synergistic interplay of charge transfer and charge trapping processes within these D-A systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>A supramolecular complexation approach is developed to improve the CO2 chemisorption performance of solvent&#8208;lean amine sorbents. Operando spectroscopy techniques reveal the formation of carbamic acid in the presence of a crown ether. The reaction pathway is confirmed by theoretical simulation, in which the crown ether acts as proton acceptor and shuttle to drive the formation and stabilization of carbamic acid.

Photoluminescence (PL) of the [PtII(C&#8201;C)(CN)2]2&#8211; complexes are tunable via the modification of ligands, intermolecular interactions and type of molecular aggregation. SC XRD, PL, and DFT unite to discriminate the rare RO&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt synthons to be responsible for the emission redshift, the RO&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ncomplex synthons being less critical.

Abstract
Tunable photoluminescence (PL) is one of the hot topics in current materials science, and research performed on the molecular phases is at the forefront of this field. We present the new (Et4N)2[PtII(bph)(CN)2]&#8901;rez3&#8901;1/3H2O (Pt2rez3) (bph=biphenyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;diyl; rez3=3,3&#8221;,5,5&#8221;&#8208;tetrahydroxy&#8208;1,1&#8217;:4&#8217;,1&#8221;&#8208;terphenyl, phenylene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diresorcinol coformer, a linear quaternary hydrogen bond donor) co&#8208;crystal salt based on the recently appointed promising [PtII(bph)(CN)2]2&#8211; luminophore. Within the extended hydrogen&#8208;bonded subnetwork [PtII(bph)(CN)2]2&#8211; complexes and rez3 coformer molecules form two types of contacts: the rez3O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ncomplex ones in the equatorial plane of the complex and non&#8208;typical rez3O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt ones along its axial direction. The combined structural, PL, and DFT approach identified the rez3O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt synthons to be crucial in promoting the noticeable uniform redshift of bph ligand centered (LC) emission compared to the LC emission of the (Et4N)2[PtII(bph)(CN)2]&#8901;H2O (Pt2) precursor, owing to the direct interference of the phenol group with the PtII&#8208;bph orbital system via altering the CT processes within. The high&#8208;resolution emission spectra for Pt2 and Pt2rez3 were successfully reproduced at 77&#8197;K by using the Franck&#8208;Cordon expressions. The possibility to tune PL properties along the plausible continuum of rez3O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt synthons is indicated, considering various scenarios of molecular occupation of the space above and below the complex plane.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;mediated Late&#8208;stage Thioetherification of Mercaptopurine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present herein a novel photo&#8208;mediated homolytic C&#8208;S bond formation for the preparation of alkylthiopurines and alkylthiopurine nucleosides. Despite the presence of reactive sites for the Minisci reaction, chemoselective S&#8208;alkylation remained the predominant pathway. This method allows for the late&#8208;stage introduction of a broad spectrum of alkyl groups onto the sulfur atom of unprotective mercaptopurine derivatives, encompassing 2&#8208;, 6&#8208;, and 8&#8208;mercaptopurine rings. Organoborons serve as efficient and eco&#8208;friendly alkylating reagents, providing advantages in terms of readily availability, stability, and reduced toxicity. Further derivatization of the thioetherified nucleosides, together with anti&#8208;tumor assays, led to the discovery of potent anti&#8208;tumor agents with an IC50 value reaching 6.1 &#181;M (Comp. 31 for Jurkat).</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Tumor Targeting and Ratiometric Photoacoustic Imaging by Fine&#8208;Tuning Torsion Angle for Colorectal Liver Metastasis Diagnosis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoacoustic (PA) tomography is an emerging biomedical imaging technology for precision cancer medicine. Conventional small&#8208;molecule PA probes usually exhibit a single PA signal and poor tumor targeting that lack the imaging reliability. Here, we introduce a series of cyanine/hemicyanine interconversion dyes (denoted Cy&#8208;HCy) for PA/fluorescent dual&#8208;mode probe development that features optimized ratiometric PA imaging and tunable tumor&#8208;targeting ability for precise diagnosis and resection of colorectal cancer (CRC). Importantly, Cy&#8208;HCy can be presented in cyanine (inherent tumor targeting and long NIR PA wavelength) and hemicyanine (poor tumor targeting and short NIR PA wavelength) by fine&#8208;tuning torsion angle and the ingenious transformation between cyanine and hemicyanine through regulation optically tunable group endows the NIR ratiometric PA and tunable tumor&#8208;targeting properties. To demonstrate the applicability of Cy&#8208;HCy dyes, we designed the first small&#8208;molecule tumor&#8208;targeting and NIR ratiometric PA probe Cy&#8208;HCy&#8208;H2S for precise CRC liver metastasis diagnosis, activated by H2S (a CRC biomarker). Using this probe, we not only visualized the subcutaneous tumor and liver metastatic cancers in CRC mouse models but also realized PA and fluorescence image&#8208;guided tumor excision. We expect that Cy&#8208;HCy will be generalized for creating a wide variety of inherently tumor&#8208;targeting NIR ratiometric PA probes in oncological research and practice.</dc:description>

         <title>Unusually Short H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H Contacts in Intramolecularly Cyclized Helically Fused Anthracenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A helically fused anthracene structure was cyclized through intramolecular Ni(0)&#8208;mediated coupling of the dichloro derivative, resulting in a cyclic structure with unusually short H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H contacts (1.648&#8211;1.692&#8197;&#197;) within the inner region. This steric environment significantly influences the spectroscopic data and the bonding nature.







Abstract
The intramolecular coupling of dichloro&#8208;substituted helically fused anthracenes using the Yamamoto coupling yielded cyclized products with sterically congested molecular structures. The X&#8208;ray analysis and DFT calculations showed that the aromatic framework adopted a nonplanar structure with a twisted conformation about the newly formed single bond, which acts as a chiral axis. Interestingly, the X&#8208;ray structure obtained through the Hirshfeld atom refinement revealed short interatomic distances between the inner hydrogen atoms (1.648&#8211;1.692&#8197;&#197;), much shorter than the sum of their van der Waals radii. Owing to these unusually short contacts, the 1H NMR spectrum exhibited a significant deshielding (12.5&#8197;ppm) and a large nuclear Overhauser effect (44&#8201;%). Additionally, the IR spectrum displayed a high&#8208;frequency shift of the C&#8722;H stretching vibration. These observations, along with the noncovalent interaction plot indicative of a characteristic steric environment, strongly support the presence of steric hindrance. Moreover, dynamic NMR measurement of the mesityl&#8208;substituted derivative yielded a barrier to helical inversion of 84&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. The optical properties and crystal packing of the cyclized products are also reported.

&lt;p&gt;The intramolecular coupling of dichloro-substituted helically fused anthracenes using the Yamamoto coupling yielded cyclized products with sterically congested molecular structures. The X-ray analysis and DFT calculations showed that the aromatic framework adopted a nonplanar structure with a twisted conformation about the newly formed single bond, which acts as a chiral axis. Interestingly, the X-ray structure obtained through the Hirshfeld atom refinement revealed short interatomic distances between the inner hydrogen atoms (1.648&#8211;1.692&#8197;&#197;), much shorter than the sum of their van der Waals radii. Owing to these unusually short contacts, the &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR spectrum exhibited a significant deshielding (12.5&#8197;ppm) and a large nuclear Overhauser effect (44&#8201;%). Additionally, the IR spectrum displayed a high-frequency shift of the C&#8722;H stretching vibration. These observations, along with the noncovalent interaction plot indicative of a characteristic steric environment, strongly support the presence of steric hindrance. Moreover, dynamic NMR measurement of the mesityl-substituted derivative yielded a barrier to helical inversion of 84&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The optical properties and crystal packing of the cyclized products are also reported.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
An iron&#8208;catalyzed, visible&#8208;light induced decarboxylative alkoxyamination of carboxylic acids with TEMPO is disclosed. In the presence of FeBr2 and TEMPO, a large array of carboxylic acids including marketed drugs and biobased molecules is turned into the corresponding alkoxyamine derivatives. The versatility of the latter offers an entry towards molecular diversity generation from abundant starting materials and catalyst. Overall, this method proposes a unified and general approach for LMCT&#8208;based iron&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative functionalization.

         <title>Regiodivergent Synthesis of 4&#8208; and 5&#8208;Sulfenyl Oxazoles from Alkynyl Thioethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regiodivergent synthesis of 4&#8208; and 5&#8208;sulfenyl oxazoles from 1,4,2&#8208;dioxazoles and alkynyl thioethers has been accomplished using Br&#248;nsted acid conditions and gold catalysis, respectively. Same excess experiments and natural bond order analysis illuminate the control processes in gold mediated alkynyl thioether reactions. A telescoped annulation&#8208;oxidation protocol affords sulfoxide and sulfone regioisomers.







Abstract
The regiodivergent synthesis of 4&#8208; and 5&#8208;sulfenyl oxazoles from 1,4,2&#8208;dioxazoles and alkynyl thioethers has been achieved. Gold&#8208;catalysed conditions are used to favour the formation of 5&#8208;sulfenyl oxazoles via &#946;&#8208;selective attack of the nitrenoid relative to the sulfenyl group. In contrast, 4&#8208;sulfenyl oxazoles are formed by &#945;&#8208;selective reaction under Br&#248;nsted acid conditions from the same substrates. The nature of stabilising gold&#8208;sulfur interactions have been investigated by natural bond orbital analysis, showing that the S&#8594;Au interactions are significantly stronger in the intermediate that favours the 5&#8208;sulfenyl oxazoles. A kinetic survey identifies catalyst inhibition processes. This study into the regiodivergent methods includes the development of telescoped annulation&#8208;oxidation protocols for regioselective access to oxazole sulfoxides and sulfones.

         <title>Activation of SO2F2 at a Rhodium PNP Pincer Complex: Ligand Supported S&#8722;F Bond Cleavage to Generate NSO2F Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Treatment of a PNP rhodium complex with SO2F2 led to the bimetallic rhodium(I) fluorido complex trans&#8208;[Rh(F)(CO){&#312;2&#8208;(P,P)&#8722;Cy2PC2H4N(SO2F)C2H4PCy2}]2. Reactivity studies with XeF2 resulted in an oxidative addition at the Rh centres to give a Rh(III) fluorido complex.







Abstract
The &#954;2&#8208;(P,N)&#8722;phosphine ligand precursor NH(CH2CH2PCy2)2 can be used for the synthesis of the rhodium(I) complex [Rh(CO){&#312;3&#8208;(P,N,P)&#8722;Cy2PC2H4NHC2H4PCy2}][Cl] (1). The deprotonated complex [Rh(CO){&#312;3&#8208;(P,N,P)&#8722;Cy2PC2H4NC2H4PCy2}] (2) shows a cooperative reactivity of the PNP ligand in the activation reaction of SO2F2 to yield the rhodium fluorido complex trans&#8208;[Rh(F)(CO){&#312;2&#8208;(P,P)&#8722;Cy2PC2H4N(SO2F)C2H4PCy2}]2 (3) by S&#8722;F bond cleavage. It is remarkable that no reaction was observed when 3 was treated with hydrogen sources e.&#8201;g. dihydrogen, organosilicon compounds such as triethylsilane or TMS&#8722;CF3 and different fluorine sources such as SF4 or Selectfluor&#174;. However, the treatment of complex 3 with XeF2 in the presence of CsF resulted in the formation of the unique fluorido rhodium(III) complex cis,trans&#8208;[Rh(F)3(CO){&#312;2&#8208;(P,P)&#8722;Cy2PC2H4N(SO2F)C2H4PCy2}]2 (4). In the presence of pyridine(HF)X or BF3 the fluorido complex 3 converted into the dicationic complexes [Rh(CO){&#312;2&#8208;(P,P)&#8722;Cy2PC2H4N(SO2F)C2H4PCy2}]2[XF]2, X=HF (5) or BF3 (6), respectively.

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-(P,P)&#8722;Cy&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N(SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F)C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;PCy&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;). In the presence of pyridine(HF)&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; or BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; the fluorido complex &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; converted into the dicationic complexes [Rh(CO){&lt;i&gt;&#312;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-(P,P)&#8722;Cy&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N(SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F)C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;PCy&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[XF]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, X=HF (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;) or BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;), respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Silylcyclopentenes via Ball Milling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of innovative methods for synthesizing silylcyclopentene compounds is particularly important for enriching and improving the synthetical toolbox of organosilicon compounds. Herein, a facile approach has been developed for the synthesis of silylcyclopentenes promoted by mechanochemically generated organolithium species as silicon nucleophiles under ball milling conditions, avoiding the requirement of large amounts of bulk solvent. This operationally simple method demonstrates good functional group compatibility, which provides a great opportunity for further exploration of the synthetic applications of silylcyclopentenes. Density functional theory calculations indicated that the transient lithiosilole intermediates undergo a stepwise nucleophilic addition process, which governs this mechanic&#8208;force&#8208;promoted [4+1] cycloaddition reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Advances in Bioinspired Artificial Systems Enabling Biomarker&#8208;Driven Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioinspired molecular engineering strategies have emerged as powerful tools that significantly enhance the development of novel therapeutics, improving efficacy, specificity, and safety in disease treatment. Recent advancements have focused on identifying and utilizing disease&#8208;associated biomarkers to optimize drug activity and address challenges inherent in traditional therapeutics, such as frequent drug administrations, poor patient adherence, and increased risk of adverse effects. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the latest developments in bioinspired artificial systems (BAS) that use molecular engineering to tailor therapeutic responses to drugs in the presence of disease&#8208;specific biomarkers. We examine the transition from open&#8208;loop systems, which rely on external cues, to closed&#8208;loop feedback systems capable of autonomous self&#8208;regulation in response to disease&#8208;associated biomarkers. We detail various BAS modalities designed to achieve biomarker&#8208;driven therapy, including activatable prodrug molecules, smart drug delivery platforms, autonomous artificial cells, and synthetic receptor&#8208;based cell therapies, elucidating their operational principles and practical in vivo applications. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and future perspectives in the advancement of BAS&#8208;enabled technology and envision that ongoing advancements toward more programmable and customizable BAS&#8208;based therapeutics will significantly enhance precision medicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Br&#248;nsted Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Reaction via Vinylidene ortho&#8208;Quinone Methides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vinylidene ortho&#8208;quinone methides (VQMs) have been proven to be versatile and crucial intermediates in the catalytic asymmetric reaction in last decade, and thus have drawn considerable concentrations on account of the practical application in the construction of enantiomerically pure functional organic molecules. However, in comparison to the well established  chiral Br&#248;nsted base&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reaction via VQMs, chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed reaction is rarely studied and there is no systematic summary to date. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in the chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reaction via VQMs according to three types of reactions: a) intermolecular asymmetric nucleophilic addition to VQMs; b) intermolecular asymmetric cycloaddition of VQMs; c) intramolecular asymmetric cyclization of VQMs. Finally, we put forward the remained challenges and opportunities for potential breakthroughs in this area.</dc:description>

         <title>Thiolated Cyanines Appended to Partially Pegylated Gold Nanoparticles for Fluorescence Quenching of Two&#8208;Channel Photothermal Inks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Following a new approach, we prepared a nanoink with two separate photothermally responsive absorption bands. One is the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) absorption of gold nanoparticles (AuNP, d =17 nm), the second is the absorption band of two cyanine (Cy) dyes, Cy7&#8208;C6 or Cy7&#8208;C11, grafted to the AuNP surface through thiolated bridges of different lengths: the close proximity to the Au surface induces full quenching of the Cy fluorescence, resulting in thermal relaxation on irradiation. Attempts to full coat AuNP with the lipophilic Cy7&#8208;C6 and Cy7&#8208;C11 lead to precipitation from aqueous solutions. We thus prepared AuNP with partial pegylation (30, 50, or 70%), using a long chain thiol&#8208;terminated PEG bearing a &#8208;COOH function. Addition until saturation of either Cy7&#8208;C6 or Cy7&#8208;C11 to the partially pegylated AuNP gave the AuNP@Cy/PEGX% hybrids (X = 30, 50, 70) that are stable in water and in the water/alcohol mixtures used to prepare the nanoinks. Further overcoating of AuNP@Cy7&#8208;C6/PEG50% with PAH (polyallylamine hydrochloride) avoids LSPR hybridization in the dry nanoink printouts, that present two separate bands. When irradiated with laser sources near their absorption maxima, the printouts of the AuNP@Cy7&#8208;C6/PEG50%@PAH nanoink respond on two channels, giving different temperature increases depending on the irradiation wavelength.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Germyl Radical Generation via EDA&#8208;Catalyzed ET&#8211;HAT Process</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Facile generation of germyl radical was achieved by using photo&#8208;excited electron transfer (ET) in an electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex to drive hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from germyl hydride (R3GeH). Using catalytic amounts of commercially available thiol and benzophenone derivatives, the ET&#8208;HAT cycle smoothly proceeds upon blue&#8208;light irradiation without any photocatalyst.







Abstract
We have established a facile and efficient protocol for the generation of germyl radicals by employing photo&#8208;excited electron transfer (ET) in an electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex to drive hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer (HAT) from germyl hydride (R3GeH). Using a catalytic amount of EDA complex of commercially available thiol and benzophenone derivatives, the ET&#8208;HAT cycle smoothly proceeds simply upon blue&#8208;light irradiation without any transition metal or photocatalyst. This protocol also affords silyl radical from silyl hydride.

         <title>Mixed Tin Valence in the Tin(II/IV)&#8208;Nitridophosphate Sn3P8N16</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel tin nitridophosphate Sn3P8N16 was prepared in a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature reaction from Sn3N4 and P3N5. It incorporates tin in mixed oxidation states +II and +IV in a 3D&#8208;network of PN4 tetrahedra. The material was characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction methods, energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and theoretical calculations.







Abstract
Sn3P8N16 combines the structural versatility of nitridophosphates and Sn within one compound.

         <title>Protecting&#8208;Group&#8208;Free Synthesis of ADP&#8208;Ribose and Dinucleoside Di&#8208;/Triphosphate Derivatives via P(V)&#8208;P(V) Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and reproducible method for protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free P(V)&#8208;P(V) coupling reaction is reported. By developing a hydrolysis&#8208;stable ImIm&#8208;Cl analog for phosphate activation, this P(V)&#8208;P(V) coupling reaction can be used to successfully synthesize biological important ADP&#8208; and ATP&#8208;containing molecules. This method allows for pyrophosphate formation on peptides for the first time to synthesize ADP&#8208;ribosyl peptides.







Abstract
Biomolecules containing adenosine di&#8208; or triphosphate (ADP or ATP) are crucial for diverse biological processes. Synthesis of these biomolecules and development of their chemical probes are important to elucidate their functions. Enabling reproducible and high&#8208;yielding access to these ADP&#8208; and ATP&#8208;containing molecules via conventional P(III)&#8208;P(V) and P(V)&#8208;P(V) coupling reactions is challenging owing to water content in highly polar phosphate&#8208;containing substrates. Herein, we report an efficient and reliable method for protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free P(V)&#8208;P(V) coupling reaction through in&#8197;situ activation of phosphates using hydrolysis&#8208;stable 2&#8208;[N&#8208;(2&#8208;methylimidazoyl)]&#8208;1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazolinium chloride (2&#8208;MeImIm&#8208;Cl), providing the corresponding electrophilic P(V) intermediates for subsequent nucleophilic attack using their coupling partners. This P(V)&#8208;P(V) coupling reaction proceeded even in a wet reaction medium and showed a broad substrate scope, accommodating protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free synthesis of ADP&#8208;ribose and nicotinamide adenine diphosphate analogs, ATP&#8208;containing biomolecules, and ADP&#8208;ribosyl peptides.

         <title>Dual Role of a Novel Heteroleptic Cu(I) Complex in Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Cu(I) complex based on a benzoquinoxalinone derivative was used in visible&#8208;light driven CO2 reduction. The ability to accumulate charges on the non&#8208;innocent ligand not only enables its role as an excellent photosensitizer, in combination with a an Fe(III) porphyrin, but brings this complex to the next level, as it acts as photocatalyst, achieving selectively the reduction of CO2 to CO.







Abstract
A novel mononuclear Cu(I) complex was synthesized via coordination with a benzoquinoxalin&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;one&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole chelating diimine and the bis[(2&#8208;diphenylphosphino)phenyl] ether (DPEPhos), to target a new and efficient photosensitizer for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The Cu(I) complex absorbs in the blue&#8208;green region of the visible spectrum, with a broad band having a maximum at 475&#8197;nm (&#1013; =4500&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1), which is assigned to the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transition from the Cu(I) to the benzoquinoxalin&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;one moiety of the diimine. Surprisingly, photo&#8208;driven experiments for the CO2 reduction showed that this complex can undergo a photoinduced electron transfer with a sacrificial electron donor and accumulate electrons on the diimine backbone. Photo&#8208;driven experiments in a CO2 atmosphere revealed that this complex can not only act as a photosensitizer, when combined with an Fe(III)&#8208;porphyrin, but can also selectively produce CO from CO2. Thus, owing to its charge&#8208;accumulation properties, the non&#8208;innocent benzoquinoxalin&#8208;2&#8208;one based ligand enabled the development of the first copper(I)&#8208;based photocatalyst for CO2 reduction.

         <title>Enhanced Near&#8208;infrared Phosphorescent Emission Modulated by Clipping of Metallotweezers in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phosphorent nanoparticles with enhanced near&#8208;infrared emission were obtaiend by non&#8208;covalent clipping strategy. This approach offers a convenient and effecient pathway toward luminescent materials with specialized functions.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared phosphorescent materials have received significant attention due to their potential applications in bioimaging and diagnostics. Although, many types of organic phosphors with near&#8208;infrared emission have been developed, the low phosphorescence efficiency in aqueous solution hampers their practical applications in biological systems. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop near&#8208;infrared phosphorescent materials with high emission efficiency in aqueous media. Metallotweezers, based on d8 transition metal complexes, emerge as the potential candidates for realizing this objective. Specifically, metallotweezers, featuring two positively charged platinum(II) terpyridine and neutral gold(III) diphenylpyridine pincers on diphenylpyridine spacer, have been designed and synthesized, respectively. The pre&#8208;organization effect, rendered by the rigid spacer, enables the resulting metallotweezers to complex with each other, resulting in the formation of clipping complex. The synergistic rigidifying and shielding effects of clipping structure results in enhanced phosphorescent emission intensity. Concurrently, due to phase segregation between the clipping units and the polyethylene glycol tail, the clipping complex undergoes self&#8208;assembly in aqueous solution, resulting in phosphorescent emission in the near&#8208;infrared region. Overall, non&#8208;covalent clipping of metallotweezers illustrated in this study presents a new and effective approach toward near&#8208;infrared phosphorescent materials.

         <title>Supramolecular Sequential Light&#8208;Harvesting Systems for Constructing White LED Device and Latent Fingerprint Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the non&#8208;covalent self&#8208;assembly of water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arenes, using WP5&#11815;G as the energy donor and commercially available dyes DBT (acceptor I) and SR101 (acceptor II) as the energy acceptor, a supramolecular light&#8208;harvesting system with sequential energy transfer was successfully constructed. Significantly, this system shows attractive applications in white light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) devices and latent fingerprint (LFP) imaging.







Abstract
The fabrication of supramolecular light&#8208;harvesting systems (LHS) with sequential energy transfer is of significance in utilizing light energy. In this study, we report the non&#8208;covalent self&#8208;assembly of a sequential LHS by pillar[5]arene&#8208;based host&#8208;guest interaction in water and its applications in white light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) device and latent fingerprint imaging. The host&#8208;guest complex WP5

 ${ \supset }$



G self&#8208;assembles into nanoparticles in water and shows enhanced aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) effect. The nanoparticles can be further used to construct sequential LHS with fluorescent dyes 4,7&#8208;di(2&#8208;thienyl)&#8208;benzo[2,1,3]thiadiazole (DBT) and sulforhodamine 101 (SR101). Impressively, the system shows white&#8208;light emission when the molar ratio of WP5

 ${ \supset }$



G/DBT/SR101 is 1100/2/16. The material can be coated on a LED bulb to achieve white&#8208;light emission. In addition, the sequential LHS exhibit multicolor fluorescence including red emission, which have been successfully applied to high&#8208;resolution imaging of latent fingerprints.

&lt;p&gt;Based on the non-covalent self-assembly of water-soluble pillar[5]arenes, using &lt;b&gt;WP5&lt;/b&gt;&#11815;&lt;b&gt;G&lt;/b&gt; as the energy donor and commercially available dyes &lt;b&gt;DBT&lt;/b&gt; (acceptor I) and &lt;b&gt;SR101&lt;/b&gt; (acceptor II) as the energy acceptor, a supramolecular light-harvesting system with sequential energy transfer was successfully constructed. Significantly, this system shows attractive applications in white light-emitting diode (LED) devices and latent fingerprint (LFP) imaging.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fabrication of supramolecular light-harvesting systems (LHS) with sequential energy transfer is of significance in utilizing light energy. In this study, we report the non-covalent self-assembly of a sequential LHS by pillar[5]arene-based host-guest interaction in water and its applications in white light-emitting diode (LED) device and latent fingerprint imaging. The host-guest complex &lt;b&gt;WP5&lt;/b&gt;
&#8835;

 ${ \supset }$

&lt;b&gt;G&lt;/b&gt; self-assembles into nanoparticles in water and shows enhanced aggregation-induced emission (AIE) effect. The nanoparticles can be further used to construct sequential LHS with fluorescent dyes 4,7-di(2-thienyl)-benzo[2,1,3]thiadiazole (&lt;b&gt;DBT&lt;/b&gt;) and sulforhodamine 101 (&lt;b&gt;SR101&lt;/b&gt;). Impressively, the system shows white-light emission when the molar ratio of &lt;b&gt;WP5&lt;/b&gt;
&#8835;

&lt;b&gt;G&lt;/b&gt;/&lt;b&gt;DBT&lt;/b&gt;/&lt;b&gt;SR101&lt;/b&gt; is 1100/2/16. The material can be coated on a LED bulb to achieve white-light emission. In addition, the sequential LHS exhibit multicolor fluorescence including red emission, which have been successfully applied to high-resolution imaging of latent fingerprints. Therefore, we demonstrated a general strategy for the construction of sequential LHS in water based on macrocyclic host-guest interaction and explored its multi-functional applications in white-light LED device and imaging of latent fingerprints, which will promote future development and application of supramolecular LHSs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electronic Control of Polyproline II Helix Stability via the Identity of Acyl Capping Groups: the Pivaloyl Group Particularly Promotes PPII</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The polyproline II helix (PPII) is stabilized by n&#8594;&#960;* interactions. The ability to tune PPII structure in water via changes in the electronic properties of the acyl capping group is demonstrated herein. More electron&#8208;rich acyl capping groups promote PPII, both at proline and non&#8208;proline residues, via stronger n&#8594;&#960;* interactions. In contrast, more electron&#8208;poor groups exhibit lower PPII.







Abstract
The type II polyproline helix (PPII) is a fundamental secondary structure of proteins, important in globular proteins, in intrinsically disordered proteins, and at protein&#8208;protein interfaces. PPII is stabilized in part by n&#8594;&#960;* interactions between consecutive carbonyls, via electron delocalization between an electron&#8208;donor carbonyl lone pair (n) and an electron&#8208;acceptor carbonyl (&#960;*) on the subsequent residue. We previously demonstrated that changes to the electronic properties of the acyl donor can predictably modulate the strength of n&#8594;&#960;* interactions, with data from model compounds, in solution in chloroform, in the solid state, and computationally. Herein, we examined whether the electronic properties of acyl capping groups could modulate the stability of PPII in peptides in water. In X&#8722;PPGY&#8208;NH2 peptides (X=10 acyl capping groups), the effect of acyl group identity on PPII was quantified by circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy. Electron&#8208;rich acyl groups promoted PPII relative to the standard acetyl (Ac&#8722;) group, with the pivaloyl and iso&#8208;butyryl groups most significantly increasing PPII. In contrast, acyl derivatives with electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents and the formyl group relatively disfavored PPII. Similar results, though lesser in magnitude, were also observed in X&#8722;APPGY&#8208;NH2 peptides, indicating that the capping group can impact PPII conformation at both proline and non&#8208;proline residues. The pivaloyl group was particularly favorable in promoting PPII. The effects of acyl capping groups were further analyzed in X&#8211;DfpPGY&#8208;NH2 and X&#8722;ADfpPGY&#8208;NH2 peptides, Dfp=4,4&#8208;difluoroproline. Data on these peptides indicated that acyl groups induced order Piv&#8208; &gt; Ac&#8208; &gt; For&#8208;. These results suggest that greater consideration should be given to the identity of acyl capping groups in inducing structure in peptides.

         <title>Covalently Linked 5,6,11,12&#8208;Tetraazanaphthacene Dimer and Its Triptycene&#8208;Capped Derivatives as Electron Acceptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triptycene end&#8208;capped bi&#8208;tetraazaacene (bi&#8208;TpTANC) was synthesised with good solubility, rigidity, and crystallinity, and was characterised using X&#8208;ray crystallography. Bi&#8208;TpTANC is a multi&#8208;electron acceptor with a 3&#8208;step/4&#8208;electron transfer mechanism, and its electrochemistry suggests through&#8208;bond charge delocalisation in its monoanionic state. With a LUMO level of &#8722;4.1&#8197;eV, bi&#8208;TpTANC is expected to be an air stable electron acceptor or an n&#8208;type semiconductor.







Abstract
The development of electron transport and n&#8208;type materials is still largely dominated by a limited number of organic semiconductors, with fullerenes at the forefront. In contrast, substantial progress has been made in developing hole transport and p&#8208;type materials. Therefore, expanding the range of electron acceptors, making them solution&#8208;processable, and elucidating their structural arrangement by X&#8208;ray crystallography is essential. We synthesised 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bi&#8208;(5,6,11,12&#8208;tetraazanaphthacene) (bi&#8208;TANC) and its triptycene end&#8208;capped derivative, 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bi(8,13&#8208;dihydro&#8208;8,13&#8208;[1,2]benzenonaphtho&#8208;5,6,15,16&#8208;tetraazanaphthacene) (bi&#8208;TpTANC), as electron acceptors. Bi&#8208;TANC exhibits a herringbone&#8208;like crystal packing with intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; overlap, which is observed in typical organic n&#8208;type semiconductors. However, it showed poor solubility, similar to larger acenes. In contrast, bi&#8208;TpTANC exhibited favourable solubility, and its electrochemistry in solution was investigated. In the cyclic voltammogram of bi&#8208;TpTANC, reversible redox waves corresponding to 3&#8208;step/4&#8208;electron transfer were observed at &#8722;0.795&#8197;V (1e&#8722;), &#8722;0.927&#8197;V (1e&#8722;), and &#8722;1.44&#8197;V (2e&#8722;) as half&#8208;wave potentials. The redox wave associated with the two&#8208;electron transfer on the negative low&#8208;potential side indicates the presence of through&#8208;bond charge delocalisation in the monoanionic state. Furthermore, the LUMO level of bi&#8208;TpTANC is &#8722;4.1&#8197;eV, which indicates its potential as a promising air&#8208;stable n&#8208;type material.

The Pd&#8208;catalysed decarboxylative asymmetric allylic alkylation (DAAA) has been developed for sterically hindered benzofuran&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;one derived &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;keto esters.

A substrate scope of 17 examples of DAAA showed that substrates containing a di&#8208;ortho substitution pattern on the aryl ring as well as naphthyl&#8208;containing substrates gave rise to highest enantioselectivities of up to 96&#8201;% ee.

Dibenzopentalene paired with pyridyl anchor groups is shown to conduct better than aromatic analogues containing phenyl or anthracene inside single&#8208;molecule junctions. Compared to thioanisole anchors, pyridyls provide better molecular orbital level&#8208;Fermi level alignment. The result is a significant conductance&#8208;voltage response especially for a sub&#8208;2&#8197;nm long molecule. The conductance increases nearly ten&#8208;fold over a 1.5&#8197;V range.







Abstract
Antiaromaticity is a fundamental concept in chemistry, but the study of molecular wires incorporating antiaromatic units is limited. Despite initial predictions, very few studies show that antiaromaticity has a beneficial effect on electron transport. Dibenzo[a,e]pentalene (DBP) is a stable structure that displays appreciable antiaromaticity within the five&#8208;membered rings of the pentalene core. We have investigated derivatives of DBP furnished with pyridyl (Py) and F4&#8208;pyridyl (PyF4) anchor groups, and compared the conductance with purely aromatic phenyl and anthracene analogues. We find that the low&#8208;bias conductance of DBP&#8208;Py is approximately 60&#8201;% larger than that of the anthracene analogue Anth&#8208;Py and 250&#8201;% larger compared to the phenyl derivative Ph&#8208;Py. This is due to a better alignment of the LUMO with the gold Fermi level, which we confirm by conductance&#8208;voltage spectroscopy where the conductance of DBP&#8208;Py shows the greatest voltage&#8208;dependence. The F4&#8208;pyridyl compounds, which have lower LUMO energies compared to the pyridyl analogues, did not, however, form detectable molecular junctions. The strongly electron&#8208;withdrawing fluorine atoms reduce the donor capability of the nitrogen lone&#8208;pair to the point where stable N&#8722;Au bonds no longer form.

         <title>UoC&#8208;7: A Bimetallic K&#8208;Zn&#8208;MOF with an Anionic Framework Based on Fluorinated Trimesate Ligands Exhibiting a Large CO2 Uptake</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The MOFs UoC&#8208;7(1F) and UoC&#8208;7(2F) (UoC: University of Cologne) with an anionic framework based on potassium and zinc cations and fluorinated trimesate linkers show an almost unprecedented high CO2 uptake at 1&#8197;bar, which increases significantly with an increasing number of fluorine substituents.







Abstract
In solvothermal reactions of Zn(NO3)2&#215;6H2O with K(H2mF&#8208;BTC) or K(H2dF&#8208;BTC) in DMF/ethanol or DMA/ethanol solvent mixtures, single crystals of the MOFs UoC&#8208;7(1F) and UoC&#8208;7(2F) were obtained crystallizing in the hexagonal space group P63/m (no.&#160;176) (H3BTC: 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylic acid; mF&#8208;/dF: mono&#8208;/difluoro; DMF: N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide; DMA: N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide; UoC: University of Cologne). According to the general composition [(CH3)2NH2][K2Zn3(mF&#8208;/dF&#8208;BTC)3(H2O)]&#215;solvent, UoC&#8208;7 consists of an anionic bimetallic framework. The charge is compensated by a (CH3)2NH2+ cation stemming from the (partial) hydrolysis of the solvent. The crystal structure shows large channels along the hexagonal [001] direction, which accommodate the cations as well as solvent molecules. Surface areas (SBET) of 2740&#8197;m2/g (UoC&#8208;7(1F)) and 1643&#8197;m2/g (UoC&#8208;7(2F)) were obtained from N2 sorption measurements. UoC&#8208;7 shows structural similarities to the MOF NKU&#8208;521 with a 5&#8208;(1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;5&#8208;yl)isophthalate linker. Both MOFs exhibit a 4,7,8T14 topology. Despite smaller channels in UoC&#8208;7 compared to NKU&#8208;521, the CO2 uptake is considerably higher (~164&#8197;cm3/g at 1&#8197;bar/293&#8197;K) being one of the highest CO2 uptakes observed up to now.

         <title>Ligand Basicity and Chelate Effects on Sulfur Insertion vs. Sulfur Reduction by Zinc Thiolate Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of zinc thiolate complexes was synthesized and their reactivity with elemental sulfur was studied. Dependent on ligand factors such as thiolate nucleophilicity, chelation, and overall complex charge, these complexes were observed to undergo sulfur insertion or thiolate oxidation via sulfur reduction.







Abstract
4&#8208; and 5&#8208;coordinate zinc thiolate complexes supported either by bis(carboxamide)pyridine frameworks or by substituted tris(pyrazolyl)borate ligands react with elemental sulfur (S8) following two distinct pathways. Some zinc thiolate moieties insert sulfur atoms to form zinc polysulfanide complexes, while others reduce sulfur and oxidize the thiolate. Here, we compare the effects of ligand electronics, strain, and sterics for selecting the respective reaction pathway. These results show that chelating and electron&#8208;deficient thiolate ligands better stabilize persistent zinc&#8208;bound polysulfanide species.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Cycloadditions of C3&#8208;Trifluoromethylated 1,2,4&#8208;Triazines with trans&#8208;Cyclooctenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We prepared 3&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted 1,2,4&#8208;triazines, readily available from NH&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles, and studied their reactivity in cycloaddition reactions with trans&#8208;cyclooctenes. We demonstrate that these heterodienes are both reactive and stable, display fluorogenic properties, and enable the efficient labelling of unprotected peptides under biologically relevant conditions.







Abstract
1,2,4&#8208;triazines are a valuable class of heterodienes that can be employed in inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reactions. However, their broader application in bioorthogonal chemistry is limited due to their low reactivity. This article focuses on 3&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazines, which can be efficiently prepared in a one&#8208;pot reaction from NH&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles. These triazines are highly reactive in reactions with strained cyclooctenes, giving second&#8208;order rate constants as high as 230&#8197;M&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. Despite their high reactivity, the compounds remain sufficiently stable under biologically relevant conditions. We show that some of the compounds are fluorogenic, a property of potential use in bioimaging. In addition, we demonstrate the successful application of the triazines in labeling model biomolecules. Our work shows that the reactivity of 1,2,4&#8208;triazines can be enhanced by the 3&#8208;CF3&#8208;substitution, which we consider an important step toward the wider use of this promising class of reagents.

         <dc:description>
The function of microglia to clear amyloid&#8197;&#946; (A&#946;) is critical for Alzheimer&#8242;s patients. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400870), C. Qian and co&#8208;workers show how the soluble amyloid precursor protein &#945; (sAPP&#945;) effectively enhances phagocytosis and metabolism of A&#946; in damaged microglia by restoring mitochondrial function. sAPP&#945; exhibits promising potential as a safe therapeutic agent or drug carrier for the treatment of Alzheimer&#8242;s disease.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The function of microglia&lt;/b&gt; to clear amyloid&#8197;&#946; (A&#946;) is critical for Alzheimer&#8242;s patients. In their Research Article (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202400870"&gt;10.1002/chem.202400870&lt;/a&gt;), C. Qian and co-workers show how the soluble amyloid precursor protein &#945; (sAPP&#945;) effectively enhances phagocytosis and metabolism of A&#946; in damaged microglia by restoring mitochondrial function. sAPP&#945; exhibits promising potential as a safe therapeutic agent or drug carrier for the treatment of Alzheimer&#8242;s disease.

         <title>Backbone Modification in a Protein Hydrophobic Core</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeted backbone alteration is a powerful strategy for the design of protein mimetic macromolecules. The present work demonstrates artificial chain connectivity can be accommodated in the hydrophobic core of a complex tertiary fold with minimal impact on folded structure or folded stability.







Abstract
Targeted protein backbone modification can recreate tertiary structures reminiscent of folds found in nature on artificial scaffolds with improved biostability. Incorporation of altered monomers in such entities is typically limited to sites distant from the hydrophobic core to avoid potential disruptions to folding. This is limiting, as it is advantageous in some applications to incorporate artificial connectivity at buried sites. Here, we report an examination of protein backbone modification targeted specifically to hydrophobic core positions and its impacts on tertiary folded structure and fold stability. Different artificial monomer types are placed at core, core&#8208;flanking, or solvent&#8208;exposed positions in a compact three&#8208;helix protein. Effects on structure and folding energetics are assessed by NMR spectroscopy and biophysical methods. Results show that artificial residues can be well accommodated in the hydrophobic core of a defined tertiary fold, with effects on stability only modestly larger than identical changes at solvent&#8208;exposed sites. Collectively, these results provide new insights into folding behavior of protein&#8208;like artificial chains as well as strategies for the design of such molecules.

         <title>Unusual Stability of an End&#8208;on Superoxido Copper(II) Complex under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unusual stability of an end&#8208;on superoxido copper complex, [CuII(Me6tren)(O2&#8901;&#8722;)]+ (Me6tren=tris(2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;aminoethyl)amine), observed in an oxygen&#8208;enhanced atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), was investigated. It was found that the corresponding peroxide complex and the complexes [CuI(Me6tren)(DMSO)]+ and [CuII(Me6tren)(OH)]+ participate in the overall reaction cycle.







Abstract
Superoxido copper complexes play an important role as usually short&#8208;lived intermediates in biology and chemistry. The unusual stability of an end&#8208;on superoxido copper complex observed in an oxygen&#8208;enhanced atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) led to a detailed mechanistic investigation of the formation of [CuII(Me6tren)(O2&#8901;&#8722;)]+ (Me6tren=tris(2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;aminoethyl)amine) under ambient conditions. The persistence of the superoxido copper complex could be explained by a reaction cycle including the peroxido complex [(Me6tren)2CuII2(O2)]2+ together with [CuI(Me6tren)(DMSO)]+ and [CuII(Me6tren)(OH)]+ in the overall reaction.

         <title>Molybdenum Sulfide Nanoflowers as Electrodes for Efficient and Scalable Lithium&#8208;Ion Capacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature shows that molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) nanoflowers have enabled high&#8208;energy, high&#8208;power, and scalable lithium&#8208;ion capacitor pouch cells for electric vehicle applications. The excellent performance was attributed to the fast surface redox reactions on the MoS2 electrode with tailored two&#8208;dimensional nanostructure and nanoflower morphology that overcome the sluggish kinetics in conventional lithium&#8208;ion capacitors. More information can be found in the Research Article by J. Liu and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400907).

         <title>Hydrogen Tunneling Exhibiting Unexpectedly Small Primary Kinetic Isotope Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heavy pickup truck carries its load through a tunnel regardless of its molecular driver (H or D), thereby illustrating unexpectedly small primary H/D kinetic isotopic effects. These surprising results arise from the coupling of the tunneling H/D atoms with the N2 medium, thus highlighting a potential systematic oversight of quantum tunneling in many chemical reactions. More information can be found in the Research Article by C.&#8197;M. Nunes and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202401323).
