         <title>Recent Progress of Small&#8208;Molecule Ratiometric Fluorescent Probes for Peroxynitrite in Biological Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;molecule ratiometric fluorescent probes for ONOO&#8722; are summarized. The chemical structures, response mechanisms, and bioapplications of all the probes are presented. Further challenges and instructions for new ONOO&#8722;&#8208;responsive ratiometric fluorescent probes are also provided.







Abstract
Peroxynitrite (ONOO&#8722;) as a major reactive oxygen species plays important roles in cellular signal transduction and homeostatic regulation. Precise detection of ONOO&#8722; in biological systems is vital for exploring its physiological and pathological function. Among numerous detection methods, fluorescence imaging technology using fluorescent probes offers some advantages, including simple operation, high sensitivity and selectivity, as well as real&#8208;time and nondestructive detection. In particular, ratiometric fluorescent probes, in which the built&#8208;in calibration of the two emission bands prevents interference from the biological environment, have been extensively employed to monitor the fluctuation of bioactive species. In this review, we will discuss small&#8208;molecule ratiometric fluorescent probes for ONOO&#8722; in live cells or in&#8197;vivo, which involves chemical structures, response mechanisms, and biological applications. Moreover, the challenges and future prospects of ONOO&#8722;&#8208;responsive ratiometric fluorescent probe are also proposed.

A consolidated and detailed study of a library of N&#8208;doped ionic AIEgens along with thorough photophysical, computational, and crystallographic analysis has been conducted to uncover the prominent role of anion&#8208;&#960; interactions, &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, and other non&#8208;covalent interactions, in inhibiting the undesired ACQ effect.







Abstract
Recently, the concept of anion&#8208;&#960;+ interactions has witnessed unique applications in the field of AIEgen development. In this contribution, we disclose a consolidated study of a library of N&#8208;doped ionic AIEgens accessed through silver&#8208;mediated cyclization of pyridino&#8208;alkynes. A thorough photophysical, computational and crystallographic study has been conducted to rationalize the observed substituent&#8208; and counterion&#8208;dependent fluorescence properties of these luminogens. We further elucidate the prominent role of anion&#8208;&#960;+ interactions, &#960;+&#8208;&#960;+ interactions and other non&#8208;covalent interactions, in inhibiting the undesired ACQ effect. Finally, we have also demonstrated the application of selected AIEgens for imaging of mitochondria in live cells.

         <title>Mechanical Bond Enhanced Lithium Halide Ion&#8208;Pair Binding by Halogen Bonding Heteroditopic Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A family of novel halogen bonding (XB) and hydrogen bonding (HB) heteroditopic [2]rotaxane host systems constructed by&#160; active metal template (AMT) methodology, were studied for their ability to cooperatively recognise lithium halide (LiX) ion&#8208;pairs.  1  H NMR ion&#8208;pair titration experiments in CD  3  CN:CDCl  3  solvent mixtures revealed a notable &#8220;switch&#8208;on&#8220; of halide anion binding in the presence of a co&#8208;bound lithium cation, with rotaxane hosts demonstrating selectivity for LiBr over LiI. The strength of halide binding was shown to greatly increase with increasing number of halogen bond donors integrated into the interlocked cavity, where an all&#8208;XB rotaxane was found to be the most potent host for LiBr. DFT calculations corroborated these findings, determining the mode of LiX ion&#8208;pair binding. Notably, ion&#8208;pair binding was not observed with the corresponding XB/HB macrocycles alone, highlighting the cooperative, heteroditopic, rotaxane axle&#8208;macrocycle component mechanical bond effect as an efficient strategy for ion&#8208;pair recognition in general.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solvent free synthesis using a vibratory ball mill (VBM) offers the chance to access new chemical reactivity, whilst reducing solvent waste and minimising reaction times. &#160;Herein, we report the core functionalisation of N , N &#8217;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;ethylhexyl)&#8208;2,6&#8208;dibromo&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalenetetracarboxylic acid (Br 2 &#8208;NDI) using Suzuki, Sonogashira and Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig coupling reactions. The products of these reactions are important building blocks in many areas of organic electronics including: organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) and organic photovoltaic cells (OPVCs). The reactions proceed in as little as 1 hour, use commercially available palladium sources (frequently Pd(OAc) 2 ) and are tolerant to air and atmospheric moisture. Furthermore, the real&#8208;world potential of this green VBM protocol is demonstrated by the double Suzuki coupling of a monobromo(NDI) residue to a bis(thiophene) pinacol ester. The resulting dimeric NDI species has been demonstrated to behave as an electron acceptor in functioning OPVCs.</dc:description>

         <title>2&#8208;Aminoalkylgold Complexes: The Putative Intermediate in Au&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroamination of Alkenes Does Not Protodemetalate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2&#8208;Aminoalkylgold(I) complexes, the putative intermediates of Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of alkenes, were isolated and characterized. Upon titration with different acids, the complexes underwent elimination to alkenes. This behavior was further observed in the gas phase following protonation. Together with CID experiments, the results indicate that the origin of the poor reactivity of alkenes in hydroamination reactions, lies in the uncompetitive protodeauration step.







Abstract
Au&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination proceeds well for alkynes but not alkenes. We report gas&#8208;phase binding energies of alkenes and alkynes to a cationic Au center, which indicate that differences in binding are not the origin of the disparate chemical behavior. We further report the synthesis and characterization of 2&#8208;aminoalkylgold complexes, which would be the intermediates in a hypothetical Au&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of styrene. The reactivity of the well&#8208;characterized and isolable complexes reveals that protonation or alkylation of the 2&#8208;aminoalkylgold complexes results in amine elimination in solution, and in the gas phase, indicating that the failure of Au&#8208;catalyzed alkene hydroamination derives from a non&#8208;competitive protodeauration step. We analyze possible transition states for the protodeauration, and identify an insufficiently strong Au&#8208;proton interaction as the reason that the transition states lie too high in energy to compete.

         <title>Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Flavonoid&#8208;Cinnamic Acid Amide Hybrids with Distinct Activity against Neurodegeneration in Vitro and in Vivo</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flavonoid&#8208;cinnamic acid amides were synthesized and evaluated in phenotypic screening assays related to neurodegeneration. The compounds prevent cell death in models of oxidative stress and energy breakdown. The introduction of an amide yielded higher stability towards hydrolysis and altering the flavonoid core structure showed that the quercetin&#8208;cinnamic acid amide hybrid was the most potent compound, and its in&#8197;vitro properties could be translated into high activity in an in&#8197;vivo AD mouse model.







Abstract
Flavonoids are polyphenolic natural products and have shown significant potential as disease&#8208;modifying agents against neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease (AD), with activities even in&#8197;vivo. Hybridization of the natural products taxifolin and silibinin with cinnamic acid led to an overadditive effect of these compounds in several phenotypic screening assays related to neurodegeneration and AD. Therefore, we have exchanged the flavonoid part of the hybrids with different flavonoids, which show higher efficacy than taxifolin or silibinin, to improve the activity of the respective hybrids. Chemical connection between the flavonoid and cinnamic acid was realized by an amide instead of a labile ester bond to improve stability towards hydrolysis. To investigate the influence of a double bond at the C&#8208;ring of the flavonoid, the dehydro analogues of the respective hybrids were also synthesized. All compounds obtained show neuroprotection against oxytosis, ferroptosis and ATP&#8208;depletion, respectively, in the murine hippocampal cell line HT22. Interestingly, the taxifolin and the quercetin derivatives are the most active compounds, whereby the quercetin derivate shows even more pronounced activity than the taxifolin one in all assays applied. As aimed for, no hydrolysis product was found in cellular uptake experiments after 4&#8197;h whereas different metabolites were detected. Furthermore, the quercetin&#8208;cinnamic acid amide showed pronounced activity in an in&#8197;vivo AD mouse model at a remarkably low dose of 0.3&#8197;mg/kg.

         <title>Ammonia borane, NH3BH3 &#8211; A threshold photoelectron&#8208;photoion coincidence study of a potential hydrogen storage material</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We investigated the photoionization of ammonia borane (AB) and determined the adiabatic ionization energy to be 9.26&#177;0.03 eV for the X  + 2  E &#8592; X  1  A  1  transition. Although the threshold photoelectron spectrum appears at first glance to be similar to the one of the isosteric ethane, the electronic situation differs markedly, due to different orbital energies. In addition an appearance energy AE  0K  (NH  3  BH  3  , NH  3  BH  2  +  )= 10.00&#177;0.03 eV has been determined, corresponding to a hydrogen atom loss on the BH  3  &#8208;site. From the data, a 0K bond dissociation energy for the B&#8208;H bond in the cation of 71.5&#177;3 kJ mol  &#8208;1  has been derived, while the one in the neutral has been estimated to be 419&#177;10 kJ mol  &#8208;1  .</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer chromophores were regarded as good materials for laser action generation due to their inherent four&#8208;level photocycle. The excitation&#8208;dependent properties of these compounds enable light amplification from two distinct forms: both enol and keto, making it possible to obtain dual fluorescenceemission. Herein, we report that a third option is possible for the first time stimulated emission was realized with a deprotonated ESIPT molecule based on a novel rigidified 2&#8208;(2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)benzothiazole derivative, triggering the possibilityto fabricate real&#8208;time tunable active material. Through the rational engineering of the ratio of each emissive species, a red&#8208;green&#8208;blue device was fabricated with the possibility of white light generation. The degenerated two&#8208;wave mixing setup was applied to construct a&#160;continuously tunable Distributed Feedback laser.</dc:description>

A frustrated Lewis pair reminds us of a dog trying to lick a tail wound but being unable to do so because the bulky protective collar prevents this. Note the cute carborane&#8208;shaped dog toy to relieve frustration until the wound is fully healed. More information can be found in the Research Article by E.

         <title>Synthesis of Spirocyclic Cyclobutenes through Desulfinative Spirocyclisation of gem&#8208;Bis(triflyl)cyclobutenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective two&#8208;step synthesis for spiro[cyclobutene&#8208;1,9&#8242;&#8208;fluorene] has been developed that allows the arrangement of substituents on three mutually orthogonal axes (triaxes), represented as the right/left hand of Fleming's rules. This unique molecular scaffold leads to new designs of functional small molecules and macromolecules. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Hoshikawa, H. Yanai and T. Matsumoto (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200704).

Enantiomerically pure anti N&#8208;&#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;silyloxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;azidoacetyl thioimides are efficiently prepared through a direct aldol reaction from N&#8208;azidoacetyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;thiazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;thione and a wide array of aromatic aldehydes catalyzed by 2&#8211;6&#8197;mol% [Tol&#8208;BINAP]Ni(II) complexes. The straightforward removal of the heterocyclic scaffold facilitates their conversion into a variety of chiral intermediates.

Abstract
A direct and asymmetric triisopropylsilyltrifluoromethanesulfonate (TIPSOTf) mediated aldol reaction of N&#8208;azidoacetyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;thiazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;thione with aromatic aldehydes catalyzed by a chiral nickel(II)&#8208;Tol&#8208;BINAP complex has been developed (BINAP=2,2&#8217;&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;1,1&#8217;&#8208;binaphthyl). The catalytic protocol gives the corresponding anti &#945;&#8208;azido&#8208;&#946;&#8208;silyloxy adducts with outstanding stereocontrol and in high yields. Theoretical calculations account for the stereochemical outcome of the reaction and lay the foundations for a mechanistic model. In turn, the easy removal of the thiazolidinethione yields a wide array of enantiomerically pure derivatives in a straightforward and efficient manner. Such a noteworthy character of the heterocyclic scaffold together with the appropriate manipulation of the azido group open a new route to the synthesis of di&#8208; and tripeptide blocks containing a &#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid.

2,3&#8208;Disubstituted fluorene platforms for the construction of high&#8208;efficiency host materials for green phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.







Abstract
Fluorene is a classic three&#8208;membered polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, and it has been widely used in optoelectronic devices. Here we explore a simple and efficient strategy for the derivatization at the 2&#8208; and 3&#8208; positions in fluorene unit. By introducing different types of substituents, we design two pairs of 2,3&#8208;disubstituted fluorene isomers and use them as host materials for phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (PHOLEDs). The green PHOLEDs hosted by these fluorene derivatives realize high external quantum efficiencies (EQE) over 20&#8201;% with low efficiency roll&#8208;off. Particularly, the devices hosted by 2TRz3TPA and 2TPA3TRz achieve nearly 24&#8201;% EQE and 104&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1 power efficiency. These results clearly demonstrate that the 2,3&#8208;disubstituted fluorene platforms are potentially useful for constructing host materials.

&lt;p&gt;Fluorene is a classic three-membered polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, and it has been widely used in optoelectronic devices. Here we explore a simple and efficient strategy for the derivatization at the 2- and 3- positions in fluorene unit. By introducing different types of substituents, we design two pairs of 2,3-disubstituted fluorene isomers and use them as host materials for phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes (PHOLEDs). The green PHOLEDs hosted by these fluorene derivatives realize high external quantum efficiencies (EQE) over 20&#8201;% with low efficiency roll-off.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Installation of Dehydroamino Acid Motifs into Peptides Enabled by an N&#8208;Chloropeptide Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report and demonstrate the practical utility of an N&#8208;chloropeptide strategy for the rapid construction of &#916;AA&#8208;containing peptides. The quinuclidine (ABCO)&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;chlorination of peptide bonds and the subsequent &#946;&#8208;elimination of N&#8208;chloroamide efficiently provides &#916;AA&#8208;containing peptides in high yield. The strategy enables the late&#8208;stage installation of &#916;AA motifs into already&#8208;constructed oligopeptides, including a macrocyclic peptide.







Abstract
Conventional methods for the construction of dehydroamino acids (&#916;AAs), which are a unique class of non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids, require the pre&#8208;installation of special amino acids. Herein, we report and demonstrate the practical utility of an N&#8208;chloropeptide strategy for the rapid construction of &#916;AA&#8208;containing peptides. The electrophilic N&#8208;chlorination of peptide bonds is drastically accelerated by a catalytic amount of quinuclidine (ABCO), and the subsequent &#946;&#8208;elimination of N&#8208;chloroamide efficiently provides &#916;AA&#8208;containing peptides in high yield. The strategy enables, for the first time, the construction of a wide variety of &#916;AA residues in peptides without any pre&#8208;functionalized side chains and facilitates the late&#8208;stage installation of &#916;AA motifs into already&#8208;constructed oligopeptides, including a medicinally important macrocyclic peptide.

         <title>Sequential Nucleophilic Substitution of Phosphorus Trichloride with Alcohols in a Continuous&#8208;Flow Reactor and Consideration of a Mechanism for Reduced Over&#8208;reaction through the Addition of Imidazole</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micro&#8208;flow technology enables a sequential nucleophilic substitution of highly electrophilic and inexpensive phosphorus trichloride with three different alcohols including ones that contain acid&#8208; and/or basic&#8208;labile functionalities, and various asymmetric phosphotriesters were synthesized in good&#8208;to&#8208;high yields (53&#8211;83&#8201;%). Mechanistic study suggested that Berry pseudorotation was a rate&#8208;limiting step in the nucleophilic substitution of phosphorus trichloride with alcohol.







Abstract
We demonstrate a sequential nucleophilic substitution of highly electrophilic and inexpensive phosphorus trichloride with three different alcohols in a continuous&#8208;flow reactor. A variety of alcohols including ones that contained acid&#8208; and/or basic&#8208;labile functionalities were rapidly reacted. A over nucleophilic substitution that occurred during reaction of the second alcohol was suppressed by the addition of imidazole. Density functional theory calculations of the sequential nucleophilic substitutions of alcohols were performed both with and without imidazole, and Berry pseudorotation was suggested as a rate&#8208;limiting step in both cases. Herein, we discuss the reasons for the decreased selectivity in the absence of imidazole as well as those for improved selectivity in the presence of imidazole during the second nucleophilic substitution.

         <title>Planarized Phenyldithienylboranes: Effects of the Bridging Moieties and &#960;&#8208;Extension on the Photophysical Properties and Lewis Acidity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phenyldithienylboranes planarized with (CH3)2C&#8208; or CH2&#8208;bridges, which furnish S&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;S intramolecular interaction, are produced as a core unit for boron&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;electron materials. Slight difference in the bridging moieties has impacts on the packing structures and relaxation behavior in the excited state. &#960;&#8208;Extension at the thiophene rings enables tuning photophysical properties and Lewis acidity of the boron center.







Abstract
Two kinds of planarized phenyldithienylboranes, which contain (CH3)2C&#8208; or CH2&#8208;bridging moieties, were synthesized. The difference of the bridging moieties affects their packing structures and photophysical properties. In particular, the (CH3)2C&#8208;bridged derivative exhibits a large Stokes shift, unusual for such planarized compounds, that results from a large structural relaxation in the excited state. A series of &#960;&#8208;extended derivatives was synthesized, among which a p&#8208;(diphenylamino)phenyl&#8208;substituted derivative shows large solvatochromism in the fluorescence spectra, while maintaining high quantum yields even in polar solvents. The Lewis acidity of the phenyldithienylborane derivatives was also assessed by titration with pyridine. The Lewis acidity of the boron center is affected not only by the difference in the steric bulk of the bridging moieties, but also by the electronic effect of the substituents introduced at remote positions relative to the boron atom. These results demonstrate the characteristic features of planarized phenyldithienylboranes as building blocks for boron&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;electron materials.

         <title>Solid&#8208;Phase Peptide Modification via Deaminative Photochemical Csp3&#8208;Csp3 Bond Formation Using Katritzky Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method was developed to convert lysine residues on peptides to Katritzky salts directly on solid support. These salts can then be used for a photochemical deaminative Csp3&#8208;Csp3 bond forming Giese reaction. The applicability of the reaction was demonstrated with various resins, all proteinogenic amino acids, and a variety of substrates.







Abstract
Introduction of unnatural amino acids can significantly improve the binding affinity and stability of peptides. Commercial availability of such amino acids is limited, and their synthesis is a long and tedious process. We here describe a method that allows the functionalization of peptides directly on solid&#8208;support by converting lysine residues to Katritzky salts, and subjecting them to a photochemical Giese reaction under mild reaction conditions. The method avoids the need for amino acid synthesis and instead offers a late&#8208;stage modification route for rapid peptide diversification. While numerous modification approaches at the lysine amine have been described, this work provides the first example of deaminative functionalization of peptides at lysine. The two&#8208;step protocol is compatible with various substrates, lysine analogues, resins, and all proteinogenic amino acids. Finally, by leveraging solid&#8208;phase modification, this protocol facilitates the functionalization of longer peptides as was demonstrated using biologically relevant peptides of up to 15 amino acids.

         <title>Chlorine&#8208;Substituted N&#8208;Heteroacene Analogues Acting as Organic Semiconductors for Solution&#8208;Processed n&#8208;type Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>

         <dc:description>
Organic semiconductors: Chlorine&#8208;substituted N&#8208;heteroacene analogues are synthesized and the field&#8208;effect transistors based on these compounds show high electron&#8208;transport mobility of up to 0.04&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
High performance solution processable n&#8208;type organic semiconductor is an essential element to realize low&#8208;cost, all organic and flexible composite logic circuits. In the design of n&#8208;type semiconducting materials, tuning the LUMO level of compounds is a key point. As a strong electron withdrawing unit, the introduction of chlorine atom into the chemical structure can increase the electron affinity of the material and reduce the LUMO energy level. Here, a series chlorine substituted N&#8208;heteroacene analogues of 6,7,8,9&#8208;tetrachloro&#8208;4,11&#8208;bis(4&#8208;((2&#8208;ethylhexyl)oxy)phenyl)&#8208;[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4&#8208;b]phenazine (O4Cl), 6,7,8,9&#8208;tetrachloro&#8208;4,11&#8208;bis(4&#8208;((2&#8208;ethylhexyl)thio)phenyl)&#8208;[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4&#8208;b]phenazine (S4Cl), 1,2,3,4,8,9,10,11&#8208;octachloro&#8208;6,13&#8208;bis(4&#8208;((2&#8208;ethylhexyl)oxy)phenyl)quinoxalino[2,3&#8208;b]phenazine (8Cl) and 12Cl have been synthesized and characterized. Solution&#8208;processed organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) based on these four compounds exhibit good electron mobilities of 0.04&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, 0.01&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, 2&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and 3&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, respectively, under ambient conditions. The results suggest that these chlorine substituted &#960;&#8208;conjugated N&#8208;heteroacene analogues are promising n&#8208;type semiconductors in OFET applications.

         <title>The Effects of Ring Strain on Cyclic Tetraaryl[5]cumulenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of cyclic tetraaryl[5]cumulenes has been synthesized. In the smallest of the cycles, the bond angles of the cumulene are distorted to as little as 172&#8211;174&#176; based on crystallographic and computational analyses. Spectroscopic and physical properties as a function of ring size show small but consistent trends as ring strain increases.







Abstract
Cyclic tetraaryl[5]cumulenes (1&#8201;a&#8211;f) have been synthesized and studied as a function of increasing ring strain. The magnitude of ring strain is approximated by the extent of bending of the cumulenic core as assessed by a combination of X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and DFT calculations. Trends are observed in 13C NMR, UV&#8208;vis, and Raman spectra associated with ring strain, but the effects are small. In particular, the experimental HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap is not appreciably affected by bending of the [5]cumulene framework from ca. 174&#176; (&#955;max=504&#8197;nm) in 1&#8201;a to ca. 178&#176; (&#955;max=494&#8197;nm) in 1&#8201;f.

         <dc:description>
Enantioselective gold redox catalysis was achieved with newly designed chiral hemilabile P,N ligands (shown as a heavy load in the truck). We reveal a new strategy through a two&#8208;step sequence: A)&#8197;Apply a chiral hemilabile P,N ligand at the AuI stage to promote AuI oxidative addition toward aryl iodide; B)&#8197;nucleophilic addition to a chiral AuIII intermediate formed in&#8197;situ as a stereodetermining step (SDS). This strategy presents a new opportunity to enrich the versatile reactivity of gold catalysis in an enantioselective fashion. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Li, X. Shi and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201018).

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Enabled [3+2] Annulation of Aromatic Acids with Maleimides by C(sp3)&#8722;H and C(sp2)&#8722;H Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ligand&#8208;enabled palladium&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] annulation of substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with maleimides without incorporating any exogenous directing group has been developed. The annulation reaction proceeds via double C&#8722;H bond activation such as C(sp3)&#8722;H and C(sp2)&#8722;H bond activation. An external ligand (MPAA) is crucial for the success of the present protocol. A plausible reaction mechanism has been proposed to account for the present [3+2] cyclization reaction.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] annulation of substituted benzoic acids with maleimides leading to tricyclic heterocyclic molecules having a free carboxylic group in a high atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical manner is described. The reaction proceeds via a dual C&#8722;H bond activation such as C(sp3)&#8722;H at the benzylic position and C(sp2)&#8722;H bond activation at the meta position of substituted aromatics. An external ligand (MPAA) is crucial for the success of present protocol. Further, the decarboxylation and esterification of the free carboxylic acid group of observed products were carried out.

         <dc:description>N &#8208;alkylation of 5&#8208;hydroxynicotinic acid esters with electrophiles containing diene functionality produces salts that undergo intramolecular (4+3) cycloaddition reactions upon heating in the presence of base. Initial studies used a three&#8208;carbon tether to join the pyridinium ion and diene, revealing some aspects of the inherent selectivity of the reaction with such substrates. Much more challenging was the synthesis of related species possessing only a two&#8208;carbon tether. Nevertheless, the cycloaddition of such compounds was successful, leading directly to the ABC ring system of the alkaloid daphnicyclidin A.</dc:description>

         <title>Triplet&#8208;triplet Annihilation Dynamics of Naphthalene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA) is a spin&#8208;allowed conversion of two triplet states into one singlet excited state, which provides an efficient route to generate a photon of higher frequency than the incident light. Multiple energy transfer steps between absorbing (sensitizer) and emitting (annihilator) molecular species are involved in the

TTA based photon upconversion process. TTA compounds have recently been studied for solar energy applications, even though the maximum upconversion efficiency of

50% is yet to be achieved. With the aid of quantum calculations and based on a few key requirements, several design principles have been established to develop the

well&#8208;functioning annihilators. However, a complete molecular level understanding of triplet fusion dynamics is still missing. In this work, we have employed multi&#8208;reference

electronic structure methods along with quantum dynamics to obtain a detailed and fundamental understanding of TTA mechanism in naphthalene. Our results suggest

that the TTA process in naphthalene is mediated by conical intersections. In addition, we have explored the triplet fusion dynamics under the influence of strong light&#8208;matter

coupling and found an increase of the TTA based upconversion efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Halogen&#8208;Atom Transfer: Generation of Halide Radicals for Selective Hydrohalogenation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe herein the first photo&#8208;mediated process enabling the generation of halide radicals by Halogen&#8208;Atom Transfer (XAT). Contrary to radical transformations involving XAT reactivity, which exploit stable carbon radicals, this unique approach uses 1,2&#8208;dihaloethanes for the generation of unstable carbon radicals by XAT.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We describe herein the first photo-mediated process enabling the generation of halide radicals by Halogen-Atom Transfer (XAT). Contrary to radical transformations involving XAT reactivity, which exploit stable carbon radicals, this unique approach uses 1,2-dihaloethanes for the generation of unstable carbon radicals by XAT. These transient radicals then undergo &#946;-scission with release of ethylene and formation of more stable halide radicals which have been used in selective hydrohalogenations of a large number of unsaturated hydrocarbons, including Michael acceptors, unactivated alkenes and alkynes. This hydrohalogenation is tolerant of a broad range of functionalities and is believed to proceed through a radical-chain manifold that propagates by the use of silane derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Shared Prebiotic Formation of Neopterins and Guanine Nucleosides from Pyrimidine Bases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The plausible prebiotic availability of 6&#8208;aminopyrimidines makes the formation of purine nucleosides by Traube reaction an interesting pathway to explore. However, the formation of a pterin ring is the preferred outcome relative to purine nucleoside synthesis, which requires a high sugar excess to be significant. We show that a urea&#8208;based solvent is a suitable medium for the formylation, synthesis of purine/pterin ring and subsequent phosphorylation.







Abstract
The prebiotic origins of biopolymers and metabolic co&#8208;factors are key questions in Origins of Life studies. In a simple warm&#8208;little&#8208;pond model, using a drying phase to produce a urea&#8208;enriched solution, we present a prebiotic synthetic path for the simultaneous formation of neopterins and tetrahydroneopterins, along with purine nucleosides. We show that, in the presence of ribose and in a formylating environment consisting of urea, ammonium formate, and water (UAFW), the formation of neopterins from pyrimidine precursors is robust, while the simultaneous formation of guanosine requires a significantly higher ribose concentration. Furthermore, these reactions provide a tetrahydropterin&#8211;pterin redox pair. This model suggests a prebiotic link in the origin of purine nucleosides and pterin cofactors that provides a possible deep prebiotic temporal connection for the emergence of nucleic acids and metabolic cofactors.

         <title>Direct Participation of Solvent Molecules in the Formation of Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shape&#8208;matching between the peripheral hydrocarbon wedges and hydrocarbon solvent molecules regulates supramolecular polymerization and gelation. Such non&#8208;trivial solvent effect strongly evokes the possibility of direct participation of solvent molecules in the nucleation by shape&#8208;matching dependent van der Waals interaction and presence of a closely associates solvent shell around the supramolecular polymers similar to first layer of water molecules around the protein surface.







Abstract
This article reports supramolecular polymerization of two bis&#8208;amide functionalized naphthalene&#8208;diimide (NDI) building blocks (NDI&#8722;L and NDI&#8722;C) in two solvents, namely n&#8208;heptane (Hep) and methylcyclohexane (MCH). NDI&#8722;L and NDI&#8722;C differ only by the peripheral hydrocarbon wedges, consisting of linear C7 chains or cyclic methylcyclohexane rings, respectively. UV/Vis and FTIR spectroscopy studies reveal distinct internal order and H&#8208;bonding pattern for NDI&#8722;L and NDI&#8722;C aggregates irrespective of the solvent system, indicating the dominant role of the intrinsic packing parameters of the individual building block, possibly influenced by the peripheral steric crowding. However, NDI&#8722;L produces a significantly stronger gel in Hep compared to MCH as evident from the rheological and thermal properties. In contrast, NDI&#8722;C exhibits a clear preference for MCH, producing gel with moderate strength but in Hep it fails to produce 1D morphology or gelation. All&#8208;atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies corroborate with the experimental observation and provide the rationale for the observed solvent&#8208;shape effect by revealing a quantitative estimate regarding the thermodynamics of self&#8208;assembly in these four combinations. Such clear&#8208;cut shape&#8208;matching effect (between the peripheral hydrocarbon wedge and the solvent system) unambiguously support a direct participation of the solvent molecules during supramolecular polymerization and presence of a closely&#8208;adhered solvent shell around the supramolecular polymers, similar to the first layer of water molecules around the protein surface. Solvent induced CD experiments support this hypothesis as induced CD band was observed only from a chiral co&#8208;solvent of matching shape. This is reconfirmed by the higher de&#8208;solvation temperature of the shape&#8208;matching NDI/solvent system combination compared to the shape mis&#8208;match combination in variable temperature UV/Vis experiments, revealing transformation to a different aggregate at higher temperatures rather than disassembly to the monomer for all four combinations.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of electrophilic monofluoromethylselenolation reagents, Se&#8208;(fluoromethyl) benzenesulfonoselenoates 2, has been developed, which can be facilely prepared in one step and enable the monofluoromethylselenolation for a wide range of nucleophiles including indole, 6&#8208;azaindole, pyrrole, thiophene, electron&#8208;rich arene, aryl boronic acid and alkyne under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
A new class of electrophilic monofluoromethylselenolation reagents, Se&#8208;(fluoromethyl) benzenesulfonoselenoates, has been developed. They can be readily prepared from sodium benzenesulfinates, Se powder and ClCFH2 in one step under mild reaction conditions. Se&#8208;(fluoromethyl) benzenesulfonoselenoates are efficient electrophilic monofluoromethylselenolation reagents for a wide range of nucleophiles including indole, 6&#8208;azaindole, pyrrole, thiophene, electron&#8208;rich arene, aryl boronic acid and alkyne. The monofluoromethylselenolation approach features mild and environmentally friendly reaction conditions, good tolerance of various functional groups, and broad substrate scope.

         <title>Luminescent Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Metal Halides: An Emerging Class of Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid metal halides (OIMHs) are ideal as luminescent materials for stimuli&#8208;responsive technology due to their soft crystal lattice and high chemical activity. In this review, the stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviors of luminescent OIMHs based on Sb3+, Bi3+, Pb2+, Mn2+ and so on under different stimuli, including contact, pressure, mechanical force, light, heat, and gas molecules, as well as the applications of the stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviors are summarized.







Abstract
Luminescent organic&#8208;inorganic metal halides (OIMHs) are well known as a new materials family in recent years. Novel materials and applications of luminescent OIMHs have been explored by changing either the organic component or the metal halide species. Thereinto, the stimuli&#8208;responsive (SR) phenomena in OIMHs have drawn much attention recently, for not only their attractive application potential but also the helpfulness in understanding the stability of OIMHs to the external environment. Herein, the luminescent OIMHs that are sensitive to external stimuli including contact, pressure, mechanical grinding, light, heat, and gas molecules, are reviewed, with an emphasis on analyses of the structural change during the SR process. The applications of SR luminescent OIMHs in widespread fields, including gas sensing, information encryption, and rewritable luminescent paper are summarized. Finally, the challenges that deserve to be further explored in this research field are discussed, which provides certain guidance for the future study of SR luminescent OIMHs.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Conjugated Copper Phthalocyanine Nanoparticles as Highly Sensitive Sensor for Colorimetric Detection of Biomarkers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper phthalocyanine&#8208;based conjugated polymer nanoparticles (Cu&#8208;PcCP NPs) have been successfully synthesized and applied to detect various biomarkers. The colorimetric results of Cu&#8208;PcCP NPs demonstrate their excellent peroxidase&#8208;like detecting activity, substrate selectivity and catalytic stability compared to most of the reported enzyme&#8208;like nanomaterial&#8208;based colorimetric biosensors. Cu&#8208;PcCP NPs not only overcome the current limitation of polymeric material&#8208;based sensors but also provide a new direction for designing next&#8208;generation enzyme&#8208;like nanomaterial&#8208;based colorimetric biosensors.







Abstract
Though numerous nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like activities have been utilized as probes and sensors for detecting biological molecules, it is still challenging to construct highly sensitive detectors for biomarkers using polymeric materials. Benefiting from the &#960;&#8208;d delocalization e&#64256;ect of electrons, excellent metal&#8208;chelating property, high electron transferability, and good chemical stability of &#960;&#8208;conjugated phthalocyanine, the design of the copper phthalocyanine&#8208;based conjugated polymer nanoparticles (Cu&#8208;PcCP NPs) as a colorimetric sensor for a variety of biomarkers is reported. The Cu&#8208;PcCP NPs are synthesized through a simple microwave&#8208;assisted polymerization, and their chemical structures are thoroughly characterized. The colorimetric results of Cu&#8208;PcCP NPs demonstrate excellent peroxidase&#8208;like detecting activity and also great substrate selectivity than most of the reported Cu&#8208;based nanomaterials. The Cu&#8208;PcCP NPs can achieve a detection limit of 4.88&#8197;&#956;M for the H2O2, 4.27&#8197;&#956;M for the L&#8208;cysteine, and 21.10&#8197;&#956;M for the glucose via a cascade catalytic system, which shows comparable detecting sensitivity as that of many earlier reported enzyme&#8208;like nanomaterials. Moreover, Cu&#8208;PcCP NPs present remarkable resistance to harsh conditions, including high temperature, low pH, and excessive salts. These highly specific &#960;&#8208;conjugated copper&#8208;phthalocyanine nanoparticles not only overcome the current limitation of polymeric material&#8208;based sensors but also provide a new direction for designing next&#8208;generation enzyme&#8208;like nanomaterial&#8208;based colorimetric biosensors.

         <title>Revealing the Influence of Diverse Secondary Metal Cations on Redox&#8208;Active Palladium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of secondary metal cations is an attractive strategy for tuning the properties of redox&#8208;active complexes, but work with heavier elements has received less attention than it deserves. Here, a series of complexes pairing palladium with a range of mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and tri&#8208;valent secondary metal cations has been prepared and characterized. Electrochemical work reveals that electron transfer to the complexes is tuned by the incorporated redox&#8208;inactive metals, opening new opportunities for &#8220;designer&#8221; redox chemistry.







Abstract
Incorporation of redox&#8208;inactive metals into redox&#8208;active complexes and catalysts attracts attention for engendering new reactivity modes, but this strategy has not been extensively investigated beyond the first&#8208;row of the transition metals. Here, the isolation and characterization of the first series of heterobimetallic complexes of palladium with mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and tri&#8208;valent redox&#8208;inactive metal ions are reported. A Reinhoudt&#8208;type heteroditopic ligand with a salen&#8208;derived [N2,O2] binding site for Pd and a crown&#8208;ether&#8208;derived [O6] site has been used to prepare isolable adducts of the Lewis acidic redox&#8208;inactive metal ions (Mn+). Comprehensive data from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis reveal distinctive trends in the structural properties of the heterobimetallic species, including an uncommon dependence of the Pd&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;M distance on Lewis acidity. The reorganization energy associated with reduction of the heterobimetallic species is strongly modulated by Lewis acidity, with the slowest heterogeneous electron transfer kinetics associated with the strongest incorporated Lewis acids. This hitherto unexplored reorganization energy penalty for electron transfer contrasts with prior thermodynamic studies, revealing that kinetic parameters should be considered in studies of reactivity involving heterobimetallic species.

         <title>Excited&#8208;State Distortions Promote the Photochemical 4&#960;&#8208;Electrocyclizations of Fluorobenzenes via Machine Learning Accelerated Photodynamics Simulations</title>

         <dc:description>
Machine learning accelerated photodynamics simulations reveal the excited&#8208;state mechanistic pathways of fluorobenzenes. The excited&#8208;state distortions promote the cis&#8208;trans isomerization of a &#960;C&#8208;C bond during the nonradiative decay. The distribution of surface hopping structures indicates the photochemical 4&#960;&#8208;electrocyclizations of fluorobenzene originate from the dynamical effects, where the instantaneous nuclear momentum drives the &#963;&#8208;bond formation in the Dewar&#8208;fluorobenzenes.Excited&#8208;State Distortions Promote the Photochemical 4&#960;&#8208;Electrocyclizations of Fluorobenzenes via Machine Learning Accelerated Photodynamics Simulations (Li and Lopez)







Abstract
Benzene fluorination increases chemoselectivities for Dewar&#8208;benzenes via 4&#960;&#8208;disrotatory electrocyclization. However, the origin of the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities of fluorobenzenes remains unexplained because of the experimental limitations in resolving the excited&#8208;state structures on ultrafast timescales. The computational cost of multiconfigurational nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations is also currently cost&#8208;prohibitive. We now provide high&#8208;fidelity structural information and reaction outcome predictions with machine&#8208;learning&#8208;accelerated photodynamics simulations of a series of fluorobenzenes, C6F6&#8208;nHn, n=0&#8211;3, to study their S1&#8594;S0 decay in 4&#8197;ns. We trained neural networks with XMS&#8208;CASPT2(6,7)/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVDZ calculations, which reproduced the S1 absorption features with mean absolute errors of 0.04&#8197;eV (&lt;2&#8197;nm). The predicted nonradiative decay constants for C6F4H2, C6F6, C6F3H3, and C6F5H are 116, 60, 28, and 12&#8197;ps, respectively, in broad qualitative agreement with the experiments. Our calculations show that a pseudo Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion of fluorinated benzenes leads to an S1 local&#8208;minimum region that extends the excited&#8208;state lifetimes of fluorobenzenes. The pseudo Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions reduce when fluorination decreases. Our analysis of the S1 dynamics shows that the pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions promote an excited&#8208;state cis&#8208;trans isomerization of a &#960;C&#8208;C bond. We characterized the surface hopping points from our NAMD simulations and identified instantaneous nuclear momentum as a factor that promotes the electrocyclizations.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new gold standard: Phosphaphenalene gold(I) complexes are potent anticancer drugs. Subtle structural modifications of the phosphaphenalene core lead to remarkable photophysical properties and enhance the activity of the gold complexes against cancer. In particular, pyrrole&#8208;based phosphaphenalene derivatives exhibit high efficacy towards 14 different brain cancer cell lines including glioblastomas, brain metastases, meningiomas, IDH&#8208;mutant gliomas and head and neck cancers, reaching IC50 values of as low as 730&#8197;nM. Moreover, the photophysical properties of the phosphaphenalenes introduce the possibility to develop theranostic applications. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. Herold&#8208;Mende, C. Romero&#8208;Nieto, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104535).

         <title>HPLC&#8208;Based Automated Synthesis of Glycans in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new experimental set&#8208;up for a HPLC&#8208;A in solution system includes the following modifications: 4&#8208;way split valve, in&#8208;line molecular sieve cartridge and a fraction collector, which enabled fully automated batch synthesis of multiple oligosaccharides with the single press of a button.







Abstract
As the 21st century unfolds with rapid changes, new challenges in research and development emerge. These new challenges prompted us to repurpose our HPLC&#8722;A platform that was previously used in solid phase glycan synthesis to a solution phase batch synthesis described herein. The modular character of HPLC allows for implementing new attachments. To enable sequential synthesis of multiple oligosaccharides with the single press of a button, we supplemented our system with a four&#8208;way split valve and an automated fraction collector. This enabled the operator to load all reagents and all reactants in the autosampler, press the button to start the repetitive automation sequence, leave the lab, and upon return find products of multiple reactions ready for purification, analysis, and subsequent application.

         <title>Electrochemically Assisted Cycloaddition of Carbon Dioxide to Styrene Oxide on Copper/Carbon Hybrid Electrodes: Active Species and Reaction Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu/carbon paper (Cu/CP) electrode catalysts were prepared according to an in&#8208;situ electrodeposition method. They exhibited high activity in catalyzing the electrochemically assisted cycloaddition of CO2 to styrene oxide (SO) forming styrene carbonate (SC) as high&#8208;value&#8208;added product. Cu2+ atoms served as the active sites, that not only activated CO2 electrochemically but also promoted the ring opening of SO in a liquid&#8208;phase reaction.







Abstract
A novel electrochemically assisted cycloaddition process is proposed, in which highly efficient coupling of CO2 with styrene oxide (SO) can be achieved to form styrene carbonate (SC) as a high&#8208;value&#8208;added product. A series of Cu catalysts with different morphologies and chemical states were fabricated on carbon paper (CP) by using in&#8208;situ electrodeposition, and the sample with nano&#8208;dendrimer structure was found to exhibit a relatively high activity of 74.8&#8201;% SC yield with 92.7&#8201;% SO conversion under gentle reaction conditions, thus showing its potential for practical applications. The relatively high electrochemically active surface area and charge transfer ability of dendrimer&#8208;like Cu benefited the electrochemical reaction. In particular, the Cu2+ species that were formed in&#8197;situ during the reaction played a vital role in enhancing the activity and selectivity of the proposed Cu/CP hybrid catalyst. Cu2+ atoms served as active sites that can not only electrochemically activate CO2 but also facilitate the ring opening of SO. Mechanistic analysis suggested that the reaction followed electrochemical and liquid&#8208;phase heterogeneous paths, which provide a new green and sustainable route for efficient utilization of CO2 resources for fine chemical electrosynthesis.

         <title>Efficient Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 to Formate in Methanol Solutions by Mn&#8208;Functionalized Electrodes in the Presence of Amines**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon cloth electrodes were modified by attaching a manganese organometallic catalyst to the surface by covalent bonds. The system has been used for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 in presence of amines in methanol solution. The enhanced CO2 solubility and the use of pentamethyldiethylentriamine (PMDETA) induce change in chemical selectivity from CO to formate, with very high performances and high selectivity.







Abstract
Carbon cloth electrode modified by covalently attaching a manganese organometallic catalyst is used as cathode for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 in methanol solutions. Six different industrial amines are employed as co&#8208;catalyst in millimolar concentrations to deliver a series of new reactive system. While such absorbents were so far believed to provide a CO2 reservoir and act as sacrificial proton source, we herein demonstrate that this role can be played by methanol, and that the adduct formed between CO2 and the amine can act as an effector or inhibitor toward the catalyst, thereby enhancing or reducing the production of formate. Pentamethyldiethylentriamine (PMDETA), identified as the best effector in our series, converts CO2 in wet methanolic solution into bisammonium bicarbonate. Computational studies revealed that this adduct is responsible for a barrierless transformation of CO2 to formate by the reduced form of the Mn catalyst covalently bonded to the electrode surface. As a consequence, selectivity can be switched on demand from CO to formate anion, and in the case of (PMDETA) an impressive TONHCOO&#8722; of 2.8&#215;104 can be reached. This new valuable knowledge on an integrated capture and utilization system paves the way toward more efficient transformation of CO2 into liquid fuel.

         <title>1&#8208;(Azidomethyl)&#8208;5H&#8208;Tetrazole: A Powerful New Ligand for Highly Energetic Coordination Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shortening the alkyl chain in 1&#8208;(Azidoethyl)&#8208;5H&#8208;tetrazole (AET) to a methylene bridge results in the formation of highly sensitive 1&#8208;(azidomethyl)&#8208;5H&#8208;tetrazole (AzMT), which exhibits a greatly increased enthalpy of formation, hence a drastically increased detonation performance is calculated. Like AET, AzMT can be applied as ligand in the energetic coordination compounds (ECC) of several transition metals, showing the characteristics of primary explosives capable of initiating pentaerythritol tetranitrate. The ligand as well as all ECCs are fully characterized.







Abstract
Highly energetic 1&#8208;(azidomethyl)&#8208;5H&#8208;tetrazole (AzMT, 3) has been synthesized and characterized. This completes the series of 1&#8208;(azidoalkyl)&#8208;5H&#8208;tetrazoles represented by 1&#8208;(azidoethyl)&#8208;5H&#8208;tetrazole (AET) and 1&#8208;(azidopropyl)&#8208;5H&#8208;tetrazole (APT). AzMT was thoroughly analyzed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments, elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy and multinuclear (1H, 13C, 14N, 15N) NMR measurements. Several energetic coordination compounds (ECCs) of 3d metals (Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn) and silver in combination with anions such as (per)chlorate, mono&#8208; and dihydroxy&#8208;trinitrophenolate were prepared, giving insight into the coordination behavior of AzMT as a ligand. The synthesized ECCs were also analyzed by X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments, elemental analysis, and IR spectroscopy. Differential thermal analysis for all compounds was conducted, and the sensitivity towards external stimuli (impact, friction, and ESD) was measured. Due to the high enthalpy of formation of AzMT (+654.5&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1), some of the resulting coordination compounds are extremely sensitive, yet are able to undergo deflagration&#8208;to&#8208;detonation transition (DDT) and initiate pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN). Therefore, they are to be ranked as primary explosives.

         <title>Materials Formed by Combining Inorganic Glasses and Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of novel hybrid composites through the combination of the chemically versatile and functional metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) family, with ubiquitous, low cost and durable inorganic glasses is explored in this Concept article. The blends and composites created from this combination may serve to minimise, and eventually solve cost, durability and processability issues of MOFs, whilst retaining their valuable properties.







Abstract
Here, we propose the combination of glassy or crystalline metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with inorganic glasses to create novel hybrid composites and blends.The motivation behind this new composite approach is to improve the processability issues and mechanical performance of MOFs, whilst maintaining their ubiquitous properties. Herein, the precepts of successful composite formation and pairing of MOF and glass MOFs with inorganic glasses are presented. Focus is also given to the synthetic routes to such materials and the challenges anticipated in both their production and characterisation. Depending on their chemical nature, materials are classified as crystalline MOF&#8208;glass composites and blends. Additionally, the potential properties and applications of these two classes of materials are considered, the key aim being the retention of beneficial properties of both components, whilst circumventing their respective drawbacks.

         <title>The Role of Packing, Dispersion, Electrostatics, and Solvation in High&#8208;Affinity Complexes of Cucurbit[n]urils with Uncharged Polar Guests</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimentally obtained (ITC) and computed (DFT) thermodynamic binding parameters (&#916;G, &#916;H, T&#916;S) are reported for CB7&#8208; and CB8&#8208;complexes with uncharged, rigid, and spherically&#8208;shaped guests. The simplicity and diversity of the model system enabled a deep analysis of the energetic driving forces and uncovered the importance of solvation energies. Electrostatic interactions and London dispersion forces are not the selectivity controlling factors.







Abstract
The rationalization of non&#8208;covalent binding trends is both of fundamental interest and provides new design concepts for biomimetic molecular systems. Cucurbit[n]urils (CBn) are known for a long time as the strongest synthetic binders for a wide range of (bio)organic compounds in water. However, their host&#8208;guest binding mechanism remains ambiguous despite their symmetric and simple macrocyclic structure and the wealth of literature reports. We herein report experimental thermodynamic binding parameters (&#916;G, &#916;H, T&#916;S) for CB7 and CB8 with a set of hydroxylated adamantanes, di&#8208;, and triamantanes as uncharged, rigid, and spherical/ellipsoidal guests. Binding geometries and binding energy decomposition were obtained from high&#8208;level theory computations. This study reveals that neither London dispersion interactions, nor electronic energies or entropic factors are decisive, selectivity&#8208;controlling factors for CBn complexes. In contrast, peculiar host&#8208;related solvation effects were identified as the major factor for rationalizing the unique behavior and record&#8208;affinity characteristics of cucurbit[n]urils.

         <title>Nanosheets of Ni&#8208;SAPO&#8208;34 Molecular Sieve for Selective Oxidation of Cyclohexanone to Adipic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ni&#8208;SAPO&#8208;34 nanosheets have been prepared through introduction of Ni and Si into the artificial layered AlPO4 followed by exfoliation and crystallization process. The nanosheets has the 2D morphology reserved from layered precursors and the framework incorporated nickel stabilize the 2D structure, along with an extraordinary catalytic performance for the selective oxidation of cyclohexanone to adipic acid with O2.







Abstract
Nanosheets of nickel doped SAPO&#8208;34 molecular sieves in thickness of &#8764;10&#8197;nm (denoted as NS&#8722;Ni&#8208;SAPO&#8208;34) has been successfully prepared through a morphology&#8208;reserved method of synthesis. A special aluminum phosphate in two&#8208;dimensional layered structure is used as precursor and converts to crystallized SAPO&#8208;34 molecular sieve, in nanosheet morphology reserved from the aluminum phosphate precursor, under hydrothermal conditions with tetraethyl orthosilicate and templates of mixed amines added. It is found that adequate amount of nickel, &#8764;5&#8197;wt&#8201;%, added to the synthetic system is a key factor for the morphology&#8208;reserved synthesis. By characterization, the nickel is proved to be doped in the framework of the molecular sieve, which more likely helps to balance the high surface energy of nanosheet products. The NS&#8722;Ni&#8208;SAPO&#8208;34 shows excellent catalytic performance for oxidation of cyclohexanone to adipic acid by gaseous oxygen.

Illuminate ER: Two small molecules with &#947;&#8208;resorcyclic acid moiety were designed and synthesized having aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) activity due to dual intramolecular H&#8208;bonding. These small molecules localized into the sub&#8208;cellular endoplasmic reticulum to light it up.







Abstract
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has emerged as one of the interesting sub&#8208;cellular organelles due to its role in myriads of biological phenomena. Subsequently, visualization of the structure&#8208;function and dynamics of ER remained a major challenge to understand its involvement in different diseased states including cancer. To illuminate the ER, herein we have designed and synthesized &#947;&#8208;resorcyclic acid&#8208;based small molecules, which showed remarkable aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) property in water. This AIE property was originated from the dual intramolecular H&#8208;bonding leading to the self&#8208;assembled 2D aggregation confirmed by pH&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent fluorescence quenching studies as well as scanning electron microscopy. These small molecules illuminated the sub&#8208;cellular ER in HeLa cervical cancer cells as well as non&#8208;cancerous RPE&#8208;1 human retinal epithelial cells within 1&#8197;h. These novel small molecules have the potential to light up ER chemical biology in diseased states.

         <title>Systematic Exploration of Furoindolizine&#8208;Based Molecular Frameworks towards a Versatile Fluorescent Platform</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 30, May 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pair wise: The furoindolizine&#8208;based molecular framework is a versatile single&#8208;core platform capable of modulating various photophysical properties such as emission wavelength, Stokes shift, fluorescent brightness, and charge&#8208;transfer characteristics with a precise prediction. Through an in&#8208;depth structure&#8208;photophysical property relationship study, we demonstrated the rational development of live&#8208;cell imaging probes with two distinct optical features simply by reorganizing a pair of functional moieties.







Abstract
The photophysical behaviors of fluorescent molecules largely determine their major utility in biological studies. Despite their well&#8208;defined characteristics, classical fluorophores have often been challenged by their limited synthetic methodology and tunability in adjusting intrinsic optical properties. A novel heterocyclic core equipped with modular functional groups could offer the flexibility to control its photophysical properties with a minimum synthetic effort. By conducting a systematic analysis guided by quantum calculations, we proposed the furoindolizine&#8208;based molecular framework as a unique fluorescent platform capable of providing versatile photophysical properties with minimal structural modification. A broad tunability of furoindolizine derivatives&#8242; photophysical properties such as emission wavelength, Stokes shift, fluorescent brightness, and charge transfer characteristics was achieved through synergistic interaction between two functional moieties. Furthermore, this modular platform led to live&#8208;cell imaging probes with two distinct optical features simply by reorganizing a pair of functional moieties.

A broad tunability of furoindolizine derivatives&#8242; photophysical properties such as emission wavelength, Stokes shift, fluorescent brightness, and charge transfer characteristics was achieved through synergistic interaction between two functional moieties. Furthermore, this modular platform led to live-cell imaging probes with two distinct optical features simply by reorganizing a pair of functional moieties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Role of Radical Bridges in Polynuclear Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 30, May 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In N23&#8722;&#8208;radical&#8208;bridged diterbium complexes, the radical bridge induces crystal&#8208;field and magnetic anisotropy that interferes destructively with that of the outer ligands. The performance of polynuclear exchange&#8208;coupled SMMs may be significantly enhanced if the crystal&#8208;field and magnetic anisotropy induced by the local ligands and the bridging ligands are engineered collinear to each other.







Abstract
Employing radical bridges between anisotropic metal ions has been a viable route to achieve high&#8208;performance single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs). While the bridges have been mainly considered for their ability to promote exchange interactions, the crystal&#8208;field effect arising from them has not been taken into account explicitly. This lack of consideration may distort the understanding and limit the development of the entire family. To shed light on this aspect, herein we report a theoretical investigation of a series of N
&#8208;radical&#8208;bridged diterbium complexes. It is found that while promoting strong exchange coupling between the terbium ions, the N
&#8208;radical induces a crystal field that interferes destructively with that of the outer ligands, and thus reduces the overall SMM behavior. Based on the theoretical results, we conclude that the SMM behavior in this series could be further maximized if the crystal field of the outer ligands is designed to be collinear with that of the radical bridge. This conclusion can be generalized to all exchange&#8208;coupled SMMs.

Analogues of N,N&#8208;dimethyladenine exploiting both thieno&#8208;and isothiazolo&#8208;pyrimidine cores were modified with 3&#8208;subsituted azetidines to yield visibly emissive and responsive fluorophores. Ribosylation of the difluoroazetidino&#8208;modified nucleobase yielded an emissive nucleoside that displayed a substantially lower emission quantum yield in water, compared to the precursor nucleobase. The impact of the sugar moiety on the photophysical features of fluorescent nucleosides, a functionality usually considered non&#8208;chromophoric and photophysically benign, was analyzed.







Abstract
Analogues of N,N&#8208;dimethyladenine exploiting both thieno&#8208;and isothiazolo&#8208;pyrimidine cores were modified with 3&#8208;subsituted azetidines to yield visibly emissive and responsive fluorophores. The emission quantum yields, among the highest seen for purine analogues (0.64 and 0.77 in water and dioxane respectively), correlated with the Hammett inductive constants of the substituents on the azetidine ring. Ribosylation of the difluoroazetidino&#8208;modified nucleobase yielded an emissive nucleoside that displayed a substantially lower emission quantum yield in water, compared to the precursor nucleobase. Importantly, high emission quantum yield was restored in deuterium oxide, which highlights the potential impact of the sugar moiety on the photophysical features of fluorescent nucleosides, a functionality usually considered non&#8208;chromophoric and photophysically benign.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Reductive Coupling of para&#8208;Quinone Methides with 4&#8208;Cyanopyridines Enabled by Pyridine&#8208;Boryl Radicals: Access to Pyridylated Diarylmethanes with Anti&#8208;Cancer Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 30, May 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly diverse pyridylated diarylmethanes are rapidly synthesized in metal&#8208;free process mediated by B2pin2/4&#8208;cyanopyridine system. In this reaction, the pyridine&#8208;boryl radical addition to C=O bond of p&#8208;QMs 1 promotes the generation of diarylmethane radicals, which are then coupled with pyridine&#8208;boryl radicals to obtain the desired products 3. The utility of the method was highlighted by biological activity identification.







Abstract
Reported herein is a streamlined protocol to produce pyridylated diarylmethanes through pyridine&#8208;boryl radical induced reductive coupling between para&#8208;quinone methides (p&#8208;QMs) and 4&#8208;cyanopyridines using bis(pinacolato)diboron (B2pin2) as a templated reagent. The metal&#8208;free process is characterized by an operationally simple approach, excellent chemoselectivity (1,2&#8208; vs. 1,6&#8208;selectivity), and a broad substrate scope with good functional group compatibility. The mechanistic studies provided important insights into the reductive cross&#8208;coupling process between diarylmethyl radical and pyridine&#8208;boryl radical. Moreover, part of the obtained pyridylated diarylmethane products were screened against a panel of cancer cell lines, and 3&#8201;v was confirmed to significantly inhibit the proliferation of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells. This method offers a platform for the preparation of new lead compounds with antitumor activity.

The synthesis and properties of perylene bisimide dyes bridged by &#945;&#8208;oligothiophenes bearing four, five, six and seven thiophene units is described. Next to panchromatic light absorption in the UV/Vis spectrum, the compounds show donor bridge size&#8208;dependent electronic properties and excited state dynamics.







Abstract
A series of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) macrocyclic dyads consisting of an electron&#8208;poor perylene bisimide (PBI) &#960;&#8208;scaffold bridged with electron&#8208;rich &#945;&#8208;oligothiophenes bearing four, five, six and seven thiophene units between the two phenyl&#8208;imide substituents has been synthesized and characterized by steady&#8208;state UV/Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, cyclic and differential pulse voltammetry as well as transient absorption spectroscopy. Tying the oligothiophene strands in a conformationally fixed macrocyclic arrangement leads to a more rigid &#960;&#8208;scaffold with vibronic fine structure in the respective absorption spectra. Electrochemical analysis disclosed charged state properties in solution which are strongly dependent on the degree of rigidification within the individual macrocycle. Investigation of the excited state dynamics revealed an oligothiophene bridge size&#8208;dependent fast charge transfer process for the macrocyclic dyads upon PBI subunit excitation.

A novel synthesis of cesium lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) is enabled by replacing conventional small molecule ligands with zwitterion&#8208;containing block copolymers (BCPs) that are soluble in liquid phases useful for hot injection PNC syntheses. PNCs prepared in this manner are obtained in high yields with bright photoluminescence, with the zwitterionic BCPs facilitating efficient PNC isolation, long&#8208;term stability, and direct conversion to nanocomposite films.







Abstract
Traditional hot injection methods for the preparation of cesium lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (CsPbX3 PNCs, where X=Cl, Br, or I) rely on small molecule surfactants to produce PNCs with cube, plate, or rod&#8208;like morphologies. Here, we describe a new method whereby zwitterionic block copolymers are employed as macromolecular ligands in PNC synthesis, affording PNCs with excellent colloidal stability, high photoluminescence quantum yield, and in some cases distinctly non&#8208;cubic shapes. The block copolymers used in this study &#8211; composed of a poly(n&#8208;butyl methacrylate) hydrophobic block and zwitterionic methacrylate hydrophilic blocks &#8211; dissolve in useful solvents for PNC growth despite containing large mole percentages of zwitterionic groups. PNCs prepared with block copolymer ligands were found to disperse and retain their fluorescence in a range of polar organic solvents and were amenable to direct integration into optically transparent nanocomposite thin films with high PNC content.

         <title>Dynamic Control of Microbial Movement by Photoswitchable ATP Antagonists</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 30, May 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized compounds acting as antagonists of ATP and whose activity is reversibly changed by light. When the compound was given to a microorganism moving by flagella, the movement could be changed significantly and reversibly by alternating irradiation of two wavelengths. This means that we can freely control the ATP world that governs the energy flow of living things.







Abstract
Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the energy source for various biochemical processes and biomolecular motors in living things. Development of ATP antagonists and their stimuli&#8208;controlled actions offer a novel approach to regulate biological processes. Herein, we developed azobenzene&#8208;based photoswitchable ATP antagonists for controlling the activity of motor proteins; cytoplasmic and axonemal dyneins. The new ATP antagonists showed reversible photoswitching of cytoplasmic dynein activity in an in&#8197;vitro dynein&#8208;microtubule system due to the trans and cis photoisomerization of their azobenzene segment. Importantly, our ATP antagonists reversibly regulated the axonemal dynein motor activity for the force generation in a demembranated model of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We found that the trans and cis isomers of ATP antagonists significantly differ in their affinity to the ATP binding site.

         <title>Anticancer Aminoferrocene Derivatives Inducing Production of Mitochondrial Reactive Oxygen Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 30, May 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual aminoferrocene (AF) agent (3&#8201;d) is reported, which does not react with reactive oxygen species (ROS) in contrast to usual AF agents (e.&#8201;g., 3&#8201;b) and exhibits excellent anticancer effects in a variety of cancer cells and in a murine cancer Nemeth&#8208;Kellner lymphoma (NK/Ly) model. The mode of action relies on the increase of the level of mitochondrial ROS (mROS), whereas usual AF agents (e.&#8201;g. 3&#8201;b) do not affect mROS.







Abstract
Elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and deficient mitochondria are two weak points of cancer cells. Their simultaneous targeting is a valid therapeutic strategy to design highly potent anticancer drugs. The remaining challenge is to limit the drug effects to cancer cells without affecting normal ones. We have previously developed three aminoferrocene (AF)&#8208;based derivatives, which are activated in the presence of elevated levels of ROS present in cancer cells with formation of electron&#8208;rich compounds able to generate ROS and reduce mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). All of them exhibit important drawbacks including either low efficacy or high unspecific toxicity that prevents their application in&#8197;vivo up to date. Herein we describe unusual AF&#8208;derivatives lacking these drawbacks. These compounds act via an alternative mechanism: they are chemically stable in the presence of ROS, generate mitochondrial ROS in cancer cells, but not normal cells and exhibit anticancer effect in&#8197;vivo.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Dual Phosphorescence from (o&#8208;Bromophenyl)&#8208;Bis(2,6&#8208;Dimethylphenyl)Borane at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 30, May 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bromo&#8208;triarylborane o&#8208;BrTAB exhibits dual phosphorescence at room temperature; a short&#8208;lived higher energy emission originates from single molecules (T1M) whereas the long&#8208;lived component at lower energy results from an aggregate (T1A). Under 365&#8197;nm UV light irradiation, crystalline o&#8208;BrTAB emits bright pale blue light (fluorescence). After turning off the light, a persistent yellow afterglow remains for 2&#8197;s.







Abstract
Designing highly efficient purely organic phosphors at room temperature remains a challenge because of fast non&#8208;radiative processes and slow intersystem crossing (ISC) rates. The majority of them emit only single component phosphorescence. Herein, we have prepared 3 isomers (o, m, p&#8208;bromophenyl)&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;dimethylphenyl)boranes. Among the 3 isomers (o&#8208;, m&#8208; and p&#8208;BrTAB) synthesized, the ortho&#8208;one is the only one which shows dual phosphorescence, with a short lifetime of 0.8&#8197;ms and a long lifetime of 234&#8197;ms in the crystalline state at room temperature. Based on theoretical calculations and crystal structure analysis of o&#8208;BrTAB, the short lifetime component is ascribed to the T1M state of the monomer which emits the higher energy phosphorescence. The long&#8208;lived, lower energy phosphorescence emission is attributed to the T1A state of an aggregate, with multiple intermolecular interactions existing in crystalline o&#8208;BrTAB inhibiting nonradiative decay and stabilizing the triplet states efficiently.

         <title>Structural Phase Transitions and Magnetic Superexchange in MIAgIIF3 Perovskites at High Pressure**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 30, May 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Weaker under pressure: The phase transitions and magnetic properties of MAgF3 perovskites at pressures up to 100&#8197;GPa have been elucidated for the first time by DFT calculations. The emerging post&#8208;perovskite structures feature much weaker antiferromagnetic interactions than the parent perovskites. The magneto&#8208;structural behavior of the AgII compounds differs substantially from that of their CuII siblings due to the pronounced covalence of Ag&#8722;F bonds.







Abstract
Pressure&#8208;induced phase transitions of MIAgIIF3 perovskites (M=K, Rb, Cs) have been predicted theoretically for the first time for pressures up to 100&#8197;GPa. The sequence of phase transitions for M=K and Rb consists of a transition from orthorhombic to monoclinic and back to orthorhombic, associated with progressive bending of infinite chains of corner&#8208;sharing [AgF6]4&#8722; octahedra and their mutual approach through secondary Ag&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F contacts. In stark contrast, only a single phase transition (tetragonal&#8594;triclinic) is predicted for CsAgF3; this is associated with substantial deformation of the Jahn&#8211;Teller&#8208;distorted first coordination sphere of AgII and association of the infinite [AgF6]4&#8722; chains into a polymeric sublattice. The phase transitions markedly decrease the coupling strength of intra&#8208;chain antiferromagnetic superexchange in MAgF3 hosts lattices.

The magneto-structural behavior of the Ag&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; compounds differs substantially from that of their Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; siblings due to the pronounced covalence of Ag&#8722;F bonds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pressure-induced phase transitions of M&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;Ag&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskites (M=K, Rb, Cs) have been predicted theoretically for the first time for pressures up to 100&#8197;GPa. The sequence of phase transitions for M=K and Rb consists of a transition from orthorhombic to monoclinic and back to orthorhombic, associated with progressive bending of infinite chains of corner-sharing [AgF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; octahedra and their mutual approach through secondary Ag&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F contacts. In stark contrast, only a single phase transition (tetragonal&#8594;triclinic) is predicted for CsAgF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;; this is associated with substantial deformation of the Jahn&#8211;Teller-distorted first coordination sphere of Ag&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; and association of the infinite [AgF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; chains into a polymeric sublattice. The phase transitions markedly decrease the coupling strength of intra-chain antiferromagnetic superexchange in MAgF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; hosts lattices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>On the Mediated Electron Transfer of Immobilized Galactose Oxidase for Biotechnological Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 30, May 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrical wiring of galactose oxidase with a redox polymer is proven to support bio&#8208;electrocatalytic conversions with minimal interference from O2, thereby enabling the oxidation of primary alcohols while decreasing the associated production of harmful H2O2. A practical example is shown for the conversion of bio&#8208;renewable substrates. Product evaluation is used to investigate whether or not carboxylic acid derivatives are obtained after accumulation of the aldehyde product in the reaction medium.







Abstract
The use of enzymes as catalysts in chemical synthesis offers advantages in terms of clean and highly selective transformations. Galactose oxidase (GalOx) is a remarkable enzyme with several applications in industrial conversions as it catalyzes the oxidation of primary alcohols. We have investigated the wiring of GalOx with a redox polymer; this enables mediated electron transfer with the electrode surface for its potential application in biotechnological conversions. As a result of electrochemical regeneration of the catalytic center, the formation of harmful H2O2 is minimized during enzymatic catalysis. The introduced bioelectrode was applied to the conversion of bio&#8208;renewable platform materials, with glycerol as model substrate. The biocatalytic transformations of glycerol and 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) were investigated in a circular flow&#8208;through setup to assess the possibility of substrate over&#8208;oxidation, which is observed for glycerol oxidation but not during HMF conversion.

         <title>Site Occupancies, Electron&#8211;Vibration Interaction and Energy Transfer of CaMgSi2O6: Eu2+, Mn2+ Phosphors for Potential Temperature&#8208;Sensing and Anti&#8208;counterfeiting Applications</title>

The two&#8208;site occupancies, the electron&#8211;vibration interaction analyses of Mn2+, and the Eu2+&#8722;Mn2+ energy transfer are discussed. The different thermal quenching behaviours and emission colours of Eu2+ and Mn2+ ions in CaMgSi2O6 endow the co&#8208;doped samples with potential applications in temperature&#8208;sensing and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.







Abstract
Eu2+&#8208;, Mn2+&#8208; and Eu2+&#8722;Mn2+&#8208;doped CaMgSi2O6 phosphors have been prepared by a high&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state reaction. Systematic investigation of the concentration&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent luminescence of Mn2+ showed that Mn2+ ions occupy two distinct sites in CaMgSi2O6. Electron&#8211;vibration interaction (EVI) analyses of Mn2+ ions revealed Huang&#8211;Rhys factors of 4.73 and 2.82 as well as effective phonon energies of 313 and 383&#8197;cm&#8722;1 for the two sites. Eu2+&#8722;Mn2+ energy transfer is also discussed, and its efficiency is estimated by lifetime and luminescence spectra. The different thermal quenching behaviours of Eu2+ and Mn2+, the distinct emission colours of Eu2+ (blue, band peak at &#8764;451&#8197;nm) and Mn2+ (yellow&#8211;red range, band peaks at &#8764;583 and 693&#8197;nm) endow the co&#8208;doped samples with potential applications in luminescence thermometry and temperature&#8208;/excitation wavelength&#8208;responsive dual anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Irreversible Inhibition of IspG, a Target for the Development of New Antimicrobials, by a 2&#8208;Vinyl Analogue of its MEcPP Substrate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 30, May 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A substrate analogue of MEcPP, a key intermediate in the MEP pathway, has been synthesized. The target compound features a vinyl functionality in place of the natural methyl substituent. Potent irreversible inhibition towards GcpE (IspG) was observed. Introduction of a double bond allows conjugation in the putative reactive intermediates while entering enzymatic transformation. Unexpected covalent trapping could happen as consequential damage.







Abstract
IspG (also called GcpE) is an oxygen&#8208;sensitive [4Fe&#8208;4S] enzyme catalyzing the penultimate step of the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, a validated target for drug development. It converts 2&#8208;C&#8208;methyl&#8208;d&#8208;erythritol&#8208;2,4&#8208;cyclo&#8208;diphosphate (MEcPP) into (E)&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;but&#8208;2&#8208;enyl&#8208;1&#8208;diphosphate (HMBPP). The reaction, assimilated to a reductive dehydration, involves redox partners responsible for the formal transfer of two electrons to substrate MEcPP. The 2&#8208;vinyl analogue of MEcPP was designed to generate conjugated species during enzyme catalysis, with the aim of providing new reactive centers to be covalently trapped by neighboring amino acid residues. The synthesized substrate analogue displayed irreversible inhibition towards IspG. Furthermore, we have shown that electron transfer occurs prior to inhibition; this might designate conjugated intermediates as probable affinity tags through covalent interaction at the catalytic site. This is the first report of an irreversible inhibitor of the IspG metalloenzyme.

         <title>Functional Groups Assisted Tunable Dielectric Permittivity of Guest&#8208;Free Zn&#8208;Based Coordination Polymers for Gate Dielectrics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 30, May 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dielectric tuning of two Zn&#8208;based coordination polymers via the tuning of the electron&#8208;donating (R=NH2) and electron&#8208;withdrawing (R=NO2) groups is reported. The tunable high dielectric properties, wide bandgaps and thermal stability of these CPs clearly demonstrate their potential for use in the design of future gate dielectric materials.







Abstract
The dielectric properties of coordination polymers has been a topic of recent interest, but the role of different functional groups on the dielectric properties of these polymers has not yet been fully addressed. Herein, the effects of electron&#8208;donating (R=NH2) and electron&#8208;withdrawing (R=NO2) groups on the dielectric behavior of such materials were investigated for two thermally stable and guest&#8208;free Zn&#8208;based coordination polymers, [Zn(L1)(L2)]n (1) and [Zn(L1)(L3)]n (2) [L1=2&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl) benzimidazole (Pbim), L2=5&#8208;aminoisophthalate (Aip), and L3=5&#8208;nitroisophthalate (Nip)]. The results of dielectric studies of 1 revealed that it possesses a high dielectric constant (&#954;=65.5 at 1&#8197;kHz), while compound 2 displayed an even higher dielectric constant (&#954;=110.3 at 1&#8197;kHz). The electron donating and withdrawing effects of the NH2 and NO2 substituents induce changes in the polarity of the polymers, which is due to the inductive effect from the aryl ring for both NO2 and NH2. Theoretical results from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which also support the experimental findings, show that both compounds have a distinct electronic behavior with diverse wide bandgaps. The significance of the current work is to provide information about the structure&#8208;dielectric property relationships. So, this study promises to pave the way for further research on the effects of different functional groups on coordination polymers on their dielectric properties.

Herein, the effects of electron-donating (R=NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and electron-withdrawing (R=NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) groups on the dielectric behavior of such materials were investigated for two thermally stable and guest-free Zn-based coordination polymers, [Zn(L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)(L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) and [Zn(L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)(L&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) [L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=2-(2-pyridyl) benzimidazole (Pbim), L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=5-aminoisophthalate (Aip), and L&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;=5-nitroisophthalate (Nip)]. The results of dielectric studies of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; revealed that it possesses a high dielectric constant (&#954;=65.5 at 1&#8197;kHz), while compound &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; displayed an even higher dielectric constant (&#954;=110.3 at 1&#8197;kHz). The electron donating and withdrawing effects of the NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; substituents induce changes in the polarity of the polymers, which is due to the inductive effect from the aryl ring for both NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Theoretical results from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which also support the experimental findings, show that both compounds have a distinct electronic behavior with diverse wide bandgaps. The significance of the current work is to provide information about the structure-dielectric property relationships. So, this study promises to pave the way for further research on the effects of different functional groups on coordination polymers on their dielectric properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
An enzymatic bioelectrode made up of galactose oxidase electrically wired with a redox polymer was used for the electrocatalytic oxidation of bio&#8208;renewable substrates with minimal influence from ambient O2. A practical example for the conversion of glycerol and 5&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)furfural in a circular flow&#8208;through setup is shown. The products were inspected to evaluate the possibility of substrate over&#8208;oxidation during enzymatic catalysis. More information can be found in the Research Article by W. Schuhmann, F. Conzuelo and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200868).

         <title>Cover Feature: Structural Phase Transitions and Magnetic Superexchange in MIAgIIF3 Perovskites at High Pressure (Chem. Eur. J. 30/2022)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 30, May 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations predict that MIAgIIF3 perovskites undergo a series of pressure&#8208;induced phase transitions towards post&#8208;perovskite phases. These transitions are associated with changes of the first coordination sphere of AgII and an increasing complexity of the [AgF3] sublattice connectivity. Remarkably, the coordination number of the alkali metal ions decreases upon phase transitions. More information can be found in the Research Article by P. K&#246;gerler, W. Grochala, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200712).

         <title>Cover Feature: Irreversible Inhibition of IspG, a Target for the Development of New Antimicrobials, by a 2&#8208;Vinyl Analogue of its MEcPP Substrate (Chem. Eur. J. 30/2022)</title>

         <dc:description>
The rational design of a substrate analogue has afforded the first irreversible inhibitor of an IspG enzyme, a target for the development of new drugs to fight antimicrobial resistance. Inspired by the structural features of the natural substrate and by mechanistic aspects, we introduced a vinyl substituent to generate conjugated species during enzyme catalysis. Inhibition might occur through covalent interaction at the catalytic site. More information can be found in the Research Article by J.&#8208;B. Behr, M. Seemann, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200241).

Perovskite photovoltaics are being intensely explored as artificial light cells for harvesting and recycling indoor light energy, which would realize self&#8208;powered internet of things. This Review presents the scope of works in perovskite artificial light cells that have been attained with both material and device engineering, and proposes possible solutions and direction for future research.







Abstract
Perovskites have encountered a growing interest as light&#8208;absorbing materials for harvesting and recycling ambient light. This interest comes from the distinct and impressive intrinsic properties of these materials and is necessitated by the need for reliable and sustainable power supplies for wearable and portable internet of things (IoT) applications. Perovskite artificial light cells (PALCs; i.&#8201;e., indoor perovskite photovoltaics) have been intensively explored, and thus their device performance has been rapidly augmented. In this review, we summarize and consolidate the research outputs of PALCs by focusing on the tuning of photo&#8208;absorber and interlayer materials for efficient harvest and collection of artificial light sources. We also emphasize various challenges and possible future research directions that should be addressed for realizing a large market uptake of PALCs.

         <title>Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction: from Discrete Molecular Catalysts to Their Integrated Catalytic Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 30, May 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses the recent developments in design principles, structural tuning and integration strategies of molecular catalysts for electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 and provides a perspective on their future challenges and opportunities.







Abstract
Molecular catalysts (metal complexes), with molecularly defined uniform active sites and atomically precise structural tailorability allowing for regulating catalytic performance through metal&#8208; and ligand&#8208;centered engineering and elucidating reaction mechanisms via routine photoelectrochemical characterizations, have been increasingly explored for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (ECR). However, their poor stability and low catalytic current density are undesirable for practical applications. Heterogenizing discrete molecular catalysts can potentially surmount these issues, and the resulting integrated catalysts largely share catalytical properties with their discrete molecular counterparts, which bridge the gap between heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis and combine their advantages. This minireview surveys advances in design and regulation of molecular catalysts such as porphyrin, phthalocyanine, and bipyridine&#8208;based metal complexes and their integrated catalytic materials for selective ECR.

         <title>Dynamic stereochemistry of a biphenyl&#8208;bisprolineamide model catalyst and its imidazolidinone intermediates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we characterize the dynamic stereochemistry of a biphenyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bis(proline amide) catalyst in chloroform and DMSO as representative weakly and strongly hydrogen bonding solvents. Using vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) based spectra calculations, we show that the preferred axial stereochemistry of the catalyst is determined by solute&#8208;solvent interactions. Explicitly considering solvation with DMSO molecules is found to be essential to correctly predict the conformational preferences of the catalyst. Furthermore, we investigate the stereochemistry of the corresponding enamines and imidazolidinones that are formed upon reaction with isovaleraldehyde. The enamines are found to rapidly convert to  endo  &#8208;imidazolidinones and the thermodynamically favoured  exo  &#8208;imidazolidinones are formed only slowly. The present study demonstrates that the stereochemistry of these imidazolidinones can be deduced directly from the VCD spectra analysis without any further detailed analysis of NMR spectra. Hence, we herein exemplify the use of VCD spectroscopy for an  in&#8208;situ  characterization of intermediates relevant in asymmetric catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Opening of the Diamondoid Cage upon Ionization Probed by Infrared Spectra of the Amantadine Cation Solvated by Ar, N2, and H2O</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radical cations of diamondoids, a fundamental class of very stable cyclic hydrocarbon molecules, play an important role in their functionalization reactions and the chemistry of the interstellar medium. Herein, we characterize the structure, energy, and intermolecular interaction of clusters of the amantadine radical cation (Ama  +  , 1&#8208;aminoadamantane) with solvent molecules of different interaction strength by infrared photodissociation (IRPD) spectroscopy of mass&#8208;selected Ama  +  L  n  clusters, with L=Ar (  n  &#8804;3) and L=N  2  and H  2  O (  n  =1), and dispersion&#8208;corrected density functional theory calculations (B3LYP&#8208;D3/cc&#8208;pVTZ). Three isomers of Ama  +  generated by electron ionization are identified by the vibrational properties of their rather different NH  2  groups. The ligands bind preferentially to the acidic NH  2  protons, and the strength of the NH&#8230;L ionic H&#8208;bonds are probed by the solvation&#8208;induced red&#8208;shifts in the NH stretch modes. The three Ama  +  isomers include the most abundant canonical cage isomer (  I  ) produced by vertical ionization, which is separated by appreciable barriers from two bicyclic distonic iminium ions obtained from cage&#8208;opening (primary radical  II  ) and subsequent 1,2 H&#8208;shift (tertiary radical  III  ), the latter of which is the global minimum on the Ama  +  potential energy surface. The effect of solvation on the energetics of the reaction potential revealed by the calculations is consistent with the observed relative abundance of the three isomers. Comparison to the adamantane cation indicates that substitution of H by the electron&#8208;donating NH  2  group substantially lowers the barriers for the isomerization reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;light Augmented Lithium Storage Capacity in a Ruthenium(II) Photosensitizer Conjugated with a dione&#8208;catechol Redox Couple</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling redox activity of judiciously appended redox units on a photo&#8208;sensitive molecular core is an effective strategy for visible light energy harvesting and storage. The first example of a photosensitizer &#8208; electron donor coordination compound in which the photoinduced electron transfer step is used for light to electrical energy conversion and storage is reported. A photo&#8208;responsive Ru&#8208;diimine module conjugated with redox&#8208;active catechol groups in [Ru(II)(phenanthroline&#8208;5,6&#8208;diolate)  3  ]  4&#8208;  photosensitizer can mediate photoinduced catechol to dione oxidation in the presence of a sacrificial electron acceptor or at the surface of an electrode. Under potentiostatic condition, visible light triggered current density enhancement confirmed the light harvesting ability of this photosensitizer. Upon implementation in galvanostatic charge&#8208;discharge of a Li battery configuration, the storage capacity was found to be increased by 100%, under 470 nm illumination with output power of 4.0 mW/cm  &#8208;2  . This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept molecular system marks an important milestone towards new generation of molecular photo&#8208;rechargeable materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Behaviour and Chemical Species of Sm(II) in AlCl3&#8208;NaCl with Different Lewis Acidity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>AlCl3&#8208;NaCl was utilized as an electrolyte in this work due to its low melting point and Lewis acidity, in which samarium exists in two oxidation states, Sm(III) and Sm(II), resulting in unique electrochemical behaviours. Sm metal dissolves in AlCl3&#8208;NaCl melt to form SmCl2, which is verified by electrochemical and spectroscopic techniques. As the Lewis acidity of the melt increases, the diffusion coefficient of Sm(II) gradually increases, and the activation energy of diffusion decreases. Moreover, an additional co&#8208;reduction peak of Sm3+ and AlCl4&#8208; is observed to be more positive than that of Al(0)/Al(III) in Lewis basic melt, which may be tightly correlated with the variation of Sm(II) coordination in AlCl3&#8208;NaCl melt and ligand variation from Cl&#8208; to AlCl4&#8208; and Al2Cl7&#8208; as the Lewis acidity of the AlCl3&#8208;NaCl melt increases, according to the in&#8208;situ electronic absorption spectra of Sm in this melt.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Detergent Expansion Strategy for Membrane Protein Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Detergents are the most frequently applied reagents in membrane protein (MP) studies. The limited diversity of one&#8208;head&#8208;one&#8208;tailed traditional detergents however, is far from sufficient for structurally distinct MPs. Expansion of detergent repertoire has a continuous momentum. In line with the speculation that detergent pre&#8208;assembly exerts superiority, herein we for the first time report cross&#8208;conjugation of two series of monomeric detergents for constructing a two&#8208;dimensional library of dimeric detergents. Optimum detergents stood out with unique preferences in the systematic evaluation of individual MPs. Furthermore, unprecedented hybrid detergents 14M8G and 14M9G enabled high&#8208;quality EM study of transporter MsbA and NMR study of G protein&#8208;coupled receptor A  2A  AR, respectively. Given the abundance of cross&#8208;coupling chemistries, comprehensive diversity could be readily covered that would facilitate the finding of new detergents for the manipulation of thorny MPs and innovation of the functional and structural study in future.</dc:description>

         <title>Emerging trends in fluorescence bioimaging of divalent metal cations using small&#8208;molecule indicators</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visualization of cation dynamics inside living system represent a major breakthrough at the crossroad of chemistry and cellular physiology. Since the inception of BAPTA&#8208;based cellular calcium indicators in the 1980s, generations of chemical and genetically encoded ion indicators spanning the visible spectrum have been developed. In this article, we bring up three emerging concepts in this field: 1. red&#8208;shifting cation indicators towards far&#8208;red and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) channels; 2. directing the indicators to various subcellular localizations; 3. lowering the phototoxicity of indicators for long term recording. These initiatives collectively echo the advocate of 4D cellular physiology, where biological processes within living systems can be panoramically unveiled under 3D, long&#8208;term, and multi&#8208;channel imaging with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. This outlook, in our opinion, poses exciting challenges and opportunities for chemists to upgrade the toolkit of fluorescent indicators as key enablers for the new era of imageomics.</dc:description>

         <title>The Unexpected Helical Supramolecular Assembly of a Simple Achiral Acetamide Tecton Generates Selective Water Channels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Hydrated HNDPA is a highly robust example of chiral symmetry breaking, which is an extremely rare phenomenon.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202200383).







Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue is the collaborative research team coordinated by Arie van&#8197;der&#8197;Lee at the University of Montpellier. The image depicts chiral channels with highly mobile water molecules resulting from the robust self&#8208;organization of a simple achiral acetamide. Fully reversible release and re&#8208;uptake of water molecules takes place near ambient conditions, with efficient water transport and a good selectivity against NaCl suggesting it to be an efficient candidate for desalination processes.

         <title>A Series of Rare&#8208;Earth Mesoionic Carbene Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The generality of employing N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins in the synthesis of mesoionic carbene (MIC) complexes has been shown here with the advent of twelve new f&#8208;block and rare&#8208;earth metal MIC complexes, expanding the library of f&#8208;block and rare&#8208;earth MIC complexes from four to now sixteen in total. Structural, spectroscopic, and computational characterisation data suggest the presence of a solely &#963;&#8208;component to the M&#8722;Ccarbene bonding interaction, whilst magnetic studies highlight that two of the MIC complexes are field&#8208;induced single&#8201;molecule magnets (SMMs).







Abstract
We report the synthesis and characterisation of a series of rare&#8208;earth mesoionic carbene complexes, [RE{N(SiMe3)2}3{CN(Me)C(Me)N(Me)CH}] (3RE, RE=Sc, Ce, Pr, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, and Lu), greatly expanding the limited library of f&#8208;block mesoionic carbene complexes. These complexes were prepared by treatment of the parent RE&#8208;triamides with an N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin (NHO), where an NHO backbone proton undergoes a formal 1,4&#8208;proton migration to the NHO&#8208;methylene group. For all RE(III) metals, as expected, quantum chemical calculations suggest only a &#963;&#8208;component to the metal&#8722;carbene bonding, in contrast to a previously reported uranium(III) congener where the 5f3 metal engages in a weak &#960;&#8208;back&#8208;bond to the MIC. All complexes were characterised by static variable&#8208;temperature magnetic measurements, and dynamic magnetic measurements reveal that 3Dy and 3Er are field&#8208;induced single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs), with Ueff energy barriers of 35 and 128&#8197;K, respectively. Complex 3Dy is, as expected, a poorly performing SMM, but conversely 3Er performs unexpectedly well.

         <title>Enantioselective Amination of &#946;&#8208;Keto Esters Catalyzed by Chiral Calcium Phosphates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral 2&#8208;aminoindane derivatives are a relatively common structural motif found in natural products and pharmaceutical molecules. Hence its highly desirable to develop efficient synthetic methods for enantioselective amination of &#946;&#8208;keto esters. A non&#8208;toxic chiral calcium phosphate&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective amination of &#946;&#8208;ketoesters with dibenzyl azodicarboxylate has been developed, generating chiral &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketoester derivatives in good yields and moderate to excellent enantioselectivities under mild conditions.







Abstract
A catalytic enantioselective amination of &#946;&#8208;keto esters using (S)&#8208;BINOL chiral calcium phosphate has been developed. The reaction produces chiral &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;keto ester derivatives in most cases with moderate to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;%) and good yields (up to 99&#8201;%). This mild synthetic method highlights a low catalyst loading and high catalytic efficiency. When the substrate backbone was changed to 1&#8208;tetralone&#8208;derived &#946;&#8208;keto esters, unexpectedly high yields of selective redox products were obtained. The practicality of the reaction was realized by a scale&#8208;up without any significant loss in the enantioselectivity and yield. Chiral calcium phosphate was successfully recovered and reused for four runs, indicating its stability and high catalytic activity.

         <title>Influence of the Linker Chemistry on the Photoinduced Charge&#8208;Transfer Dynamics of Hetero&#8208;dinuclear Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hitting the bottleneck: For light&#8208;driven catalysis, either the first or second electron transfer or the actual catalytic turnover is the bottleneck, of which the second process is rarely studied. Here, the charge&#8208;transfer dynamics in photoexcited intermediates of a molecular photocatalyst are investigated by spectro&#8208;electrochemistry to understand the overall process and to identify deactivation channels determining the photocatalysts fate.







Abstract
To optimize light&#8208;driven catalytic processes, light&#8208;mediated multi&#8208;electron transfer dynamics in molecular dyads need to be studied and correlated with structural changes focusing on the catalytically active metastable intermediates. Here, spectro&#8208;electrochemistry has been employed to investigate the structure&#8208;dependent photoelectron transfer kinetics in catalytically active intermediates of two Ru&#8722;Rh catalysts for light&#8208;driven NAD+ reduction. The excited&#8208;state reactivity of short&#8208;lived intermediates was studied along different photoreaction pathways by resonance Raman and time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectro&#8208;electrochemistry with sub&#8208;picosecond time resolution under operando conditions. The results demonstrate, for the first time, how the bridging ligand serves as a (multi&#8208;)electron storage structure, mediates the strength of the electronic coupling of catalytic and photocenter and impacts the targeted electron transfer as well as parasitic electron&#8208;transfer kinetics.

         <title>Red Light&#8208;Emitting Thermally&#8208;Activated Delayed Fluorescence of Naphthalimide&#8208;Phenoxazine Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Dyad: Time&#8208;Resolved Optical and Magnetic Spectroscopic Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The locally&#8208;excited triplet state (3LE) is found as an essential intermediate state in thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) of compact electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor system. 3LE and charge&#8208;separated states (1CS and 3CS) are close to each other in energy, the interaction of three states causes TADF, which is analyzed by femtosecond/nanosecond transient absorption spectra and time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy.







Abstract
We prepared an orthogonal compact electron&#8208;donor (phenoxazine, PXZ)&#8208;acceptor (naphthalimide, NI) dyad (NI&#8208;PXZ), to study the photophysics of the thermally&#8208;activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), which has a luminescence lifetime of 16.4&#8197;ns (99.2&#8201;%)/17.0&#8197;&#956;s (0.80&#8201;%). A weak charge transfer (CT) absorption band was observed for the dyad, indicating non&#8208;negligible electronic coupling between the donor and acceptor at the ground state. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy shows a fast charge separation (CS) (ca. 2.02&#8764;2.72&#8197;ps), the majority of the singlet CS state is short&#8208;lived, especially in polar solvents (&#964;CR = 10.3&#8197;ps in acetonitrile, vs. 1.83&#8197;ns in toluene, 7.81&#8197;ns in n&#8208;hexane). Nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy detects a long&#8208;lived transient species in n&#8208;hexane, which is with a mixed triplet local excited state (3LE) and charge separated state (3CS), the lifetime is 15.4&#8197;&#956;s. In polar solvents, such as tetrahydrofuran and acetonitrile, a neat 3CS state was observed, whose lifetimes are 226&#8197;ns and 142&#8197;ns, respectively. Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectra indicate the existence of strongly spin exchanged 3LE/3CT states, with the effective zero field splitting (ZFS) |D| and |E| parameters of 1484&#8197;MHz and 109&#8197;MHz, respectively, much smaller than that of the native 3NI state (2475 and 135&#8197;MHz). It is rare but solid experimental evidence that a closely&#8208;lying 3LE state is crucial for occurrence of TADF and this 3LE state is an essential intermediate state to facilitate reverse intersystem crossing in TADF systems.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Glycosylated Cholera Toxin B Subunit as a Tracer of Glycoprotein Trafficking in Organelles of Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed and chemically synthesized intentionally glycosylated cholera toxin B&#8208;subunit (glycosyl&#8208;CTB) as a tracer to investigate maturation and functions of N&#8208;glycans on the biosynthesis of glycoproteins. The obtained glycoprotein was successfully transported to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus of living cells.







Abstract
Glycosylation of proteins is known to be essential for changing biological activity and stability of glycoproteins on the cell surfaces and in body fluids. Delivering of homogeneous glycoproteins into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus would enable us to investigate the function of asparagine&#8208;linked (N&#8208;) glycans in the organelles. In this work, we designed and synthesized an intentionally glycosylated cholera toxin B&#8208;subunit (CTB) to be transported to the organelles of mammalian cells. The heptasaccharide, the intermediate structure of various complex&#8208;type N&#8208;glycans, was introduced to the CTB. The synthesized monomeric glycosyl&#8208;CTB successfully entered mammalian cells and was transported to the Golgi and the ER, suggesting the potential use of synthetic CTB to deliver and investigate the functions of homogeneous N&#8208;glycans in specific organelles of living cells.

         <title>Near Infared Circularly Polarized Luminescence From Water Stable Organic Nanoparticles Containing a Chiral Yb(III) Complex</title>

Unprecedented NIR CPL activity in water from a hydrophobic chiral Yb(III) complex embedded in PLGA nanoparticles was observed







Abstract
We report the first example of very efficient NIR Circularly Polarized Luminescence (CPL) (around 970&#8197;nm) in water, obtained thanks to the combined use of a chiral Yb complex and of poly lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles. [YbL(tta)2]CH3COO (L=N, N&#8217;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;pyridylmethylidene)&#8208;1,2&#8208;(R,R+S,S) cyclohexanediamine and tta=2&#8208;thenoyltrifluoroacetonate) shows good CPL in organic solvents, because the tta ligands efficiently sensitize Yb NIR luminescence and the readily prepared chiral ligand L endows the complex with the necessary dissymmetry. PLGA nanoparticles incorporate the complex and protect the metal ion from the intrusion of solvent molecules, while ensuring biocompatibility, water solubility and stability to the complex. Hydrophilic NIR&#8208;CPL optical probes can find applications in the field of NIR&#8208;CPL bio&#8208;assays.

         <title>Chiral Fibers Formation Upon Assembly of Tetraphenylalanine Peptide Conjugated to a PNA Dimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetraphenylalanine peptide (4F) conjugated to the PNA dimer &#8220;at&#8221; self&#8208;assembles to produce helical fibers. Interactions between both components of the conjugate, either the peptide and the nucleobases, trigger self&#8208;assembly. Antiparallel beta sheets between the peptides are zipped by hydrogen bonds between complementary nucleobases. Spectroscopic measurements, microscopy data along with a computational model support this hypothesis. On the contrary, when &#8220;at&#8221; is replaced by &#8220;gc&#8221; PNA, odd shaped spheroid are obtained.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of biomolecules such as peptides, nucleic acids or their analogues affords supramolecular objects, exhibiting structures and physical properties dependent on the amino&#8208;acid or nucleobase composition. Conjugation of the peptide diphenylalanine (FF) to peptide nucleic acids triggers formation of self&#8208;assembled structures, mainly stabilized by interactions between FF. In this work we report formation of homogeneous chiral fibers upon self&#8208;assembly of the hybrid composed of the tetraphenylalanine peptide (4F) conjugated to the PNA dimer adenine&#8208;thymine (at). In this case nucleobases seem to play a key role in determining the morphology and chirality of the fibers. When the PNA &#8220;at&#8221; is replaced by guanine&#8208;cytosine dimer &#8220;gc&#8221;, disordered structures are observed. Spectroscopic characterization of the self&#8208;assembled hybrids, along with AFM and SEM studies is reported. Finally, a structural model consistent with the experimental evidence has also been obtained, showing how the building blocks of 4Fat arrange to give helical fibers.

         <title>Cross&#8208;Talks Between Sulfane Sulfur and Thiol at a Zinc(II) Site</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tripodal [ZnII] complex has been demonstrated to assist cross&#8208;talks between sulfane sulfur and thiol under ambient base&#8208;free conditions, thereby revealing new possible roles of [ZnII] coordination motifs in thiol persulfidation, polysulfide formation, and its cross&#8208;over with free thiol relevant to sulfur biochemistry.







Abstract
Transformations of sulfane sulfur compounds (e.&#8201;g. organic polysulfides (R&#8722;Sn&#8722;R, n&gt;2) and elemental sulfur (S8)) play pivotal roles in the biochemical landscape of sulfur, and thus supports signaling activities of H2S. Although a number of previous reports illustrate amine mediated reactions of S8 and thiol (RSH) yielding R&#8722;Sn&#8722;R, this report illustrates that a tripodal [ZnII] complex [(Bn3Tren)ZnII&#8722;OH2](ClO4)2 (1) facilitates the reactions of sulfane sulfur and thiol (RSH), thereby offering an amine&#8208;free biologically relevant complementary route. UV&#8208;vis monitoring of the reactions and a set of control experiments underline the definitive role of [ZnII] coordination motif in the reactions of sulfane sulfur (e.&#8201;g. S8 and R&#8722;Sn&#8722;R) with RSH. Detailed investigations (UV&#8208;vis, NMR, ESI&#8208;MS, intermediate trapping, and TEMPO radical interference experiments) disclose the key differences in the [ZnII] versus previously known amine mediated routes. Moreover, the persulfide (RSS&#8722;) trapping experiments using 1&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2,4&#8208;dinitrobenzene (F&#8208;DNB) reveal the intermediacy of RSS&#8722; species in the [ZnII] mediated reactions of sulfane sulfur and thiol, thereby demonstrating [ZnII] assisted persulfidation of thiol in the presence of sulfane sulfur species. Of broader impact, this study underscores the feasible influence of biologically relevant [ZnII] coordination motifs (e.&#8201;g. carbonic anhydrase) on the sulfane sulfur chemistry in biology.

         <title>A Porous Sulfonated 2D Zirconium Metal&#8211;Organic Framework as a Robust Platform for Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D Zr&#8208;MOF gets sulfonated: By using the strategy of pre&#8208;assembly chlorosulfonation applied to a linker precursor, the first sulfonated zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structure is synthesized.

Abstract
By using the strategy of pre&#8208;assembly chlorosulfonation applied to a linker precursor, the first sulfonated zirconium metal&#8211;organic framework (JUK&#8208;14) with two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structure, was synthesized. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals that the material is built of Zr6O4(OH)4(COO)8 oxoclusters, doubly 4&#8208;connected by angular dicarboxylates, and stacked in layers spaced 1.5&#8197;nm apart by the presence of sulfonic groups. JUK&#8208;14 exhibits excellent hydrothermal stability, permanent porosity confirmed by gas adsorption studies, and shows high (&gt;10&#8722;4&#8197;S/cm) and low (&lt;10&#8722;8&#8197;S/cm) proton conductivity under humidified and anhydrous conditions, respectively. Post&#8208;synthesis inclusion of imidazole improves the overall conductivity increasing it to 1.7&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S/cm at 60&#8201;&#176;C and 90&#8201;% relative humidity, and by 3 orders of magnitude at 160&#8201;&#176;C. The combination of 2D porous nature with robustness of zirconium MOFs offers new opportunities for exploration of the material towards energy and environmental applications.

         <title>Selective Labeling of Peptides with o&#8208;Carboranes via Manganese(I)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation</title>

The direct incorporation of a carborane moiety into tryptophan&#8208;containing peptides is presented as a sustainable method to access novel potential anti&#8208;cancer and BNCT agents via non&#8208;toxic manganese(I) catalysis.







Abstract
A robust method for the selective labeling of peptides via manganese(I) catalysis was devised to achieve the C&#8208;2 alkenylation of tryptophan containing peptides with 1&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;o&#8208;carboranes. The manganese&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation was accomplished with high catalytic efficiency, and featured low toxicity, high functional group tolerance and excellent E&#8208;stereoselectivity. This approach unravels a promising tool for the assembly of o&#8208;carborane with structurally complex peptides of relevance to applications in boron neutron capture therapy.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate herein the capacity of simple carboxylate salts &#8211; tetrametylammonium and tetramethylguanidinium pivalate &#8211; to act as catalysts in the isomerization of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated thioesters to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated thioesters. The carboxylate catalysts gave reaction rates comparable to those obtained with DBU, but with fewer side reactions. The reaction exhibits a normal secondary kinetic isotope effect (  k  1H  /  k  1D  = 1.065&#177;0.026) with a &#946;,&#947;&#8722;deuterated substrate. Computational analysis of the mechanism provides a similar value (  k  1H  /  k  1D  = 1.05) with a mechanism where &#947;&#8208;reprotonation of the enolate intermediate is rate determining.</dc:description>

         <title>Advances towards Cell Specific Gene Transfection &#8211; A Small Molecule Approach Allows for Order of Magnitude Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A transfection vector with tumor homing capacity is reported. While previous vectors that allow for moderately cell selective gene transfection utilized larger systems, this small molecule approach allowed for precise chemical optimization. For this biotin, mediating cell selectivity, was combined with the potent DNA&#8208;binding motif tetralysine&#8208;GCP via a hydrophilic linker, thus allowing for SAR based optimization. The new vector was able to mediate biotin receptor (BR)&#8208;selective transfection and was tested on five cell types with different BR expression levels. A computer&#8208;based analysis of microscopy images revealed a preference of one order of magnitude for the BR&#8208;positive cell lines over the BR&#8208;negative controls.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The first diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective cyclopropanation reactions of electron&#8208;deficient allenes with donor&#8208;acceptor and diacceptor diazo reagents are described.

This methodology gave a direct access to ACPs bearing multiple electron&#8208;deficient substituents and allows to further expand the availability of ACPs chemistry. Interestingly, during the examination of the scope of this reaction, the asymmetric intramolecular C&#8210;H insertion reaction into  tert  &#8208;butyl group was observed as a side reaction with up to 94:6 e.r.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Acidic catecholamine metabolites, which could serve as diagnostic markers for many diseases, demonstrate an importance of accurate sensing. However, they share a highly similar chemical structure, which is a challenge in the design of sensing strategies. A nanopore may be engineered to sense these metabolites in a single molecule manner. To achieve this, a recently developed programmable nano&#8208;reactor for stochastic sensing (PNRSS) technique adapted with a phenylboronic acid (PBA) adaptor was applied. Three acidic catecholamine metabolites, including 3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), 3,4&#8208;dihydroxymandelic acid (DHMA) and 3&#8208;methoxy&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxymandetic acid (VMA) were investigated by PNRSS. Specifically, DHMA, which contains an &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylate moiety and an adjacent  cis  &#8208;hydroxyl groups on its benzene ring, reports two binding modes simultaneously resolvable by PNRSS. Assisted with the high resolution of PNRSS, direct regulation of these two binding modes by pH can also be observed. A custom machine learning algorithm was also developed to achieve automatic event classification.</dc:description>

         <title>GNPS&#8208;Guided Discovery of Madurastatin Siderophores from the Termite&#8208;Associated Actinomadura sp. RB99**
</title>

         <dc:description>
Metabolomic analysis of cocultures of Actinomadura sp. RB99 with fungal symbionts of termites allowed for the MS&#8208;guided isolation of four unreported madurastatin derivatives, including a siderophore&#8208;metal complex thereof.







Abstract
In this study, we analyzed if Actinomadura sp. RB99 produces siderophores that that could be responsible for the antimicrobial activity observed in co&#8208;cultivation studies. Dereplication of high&#8208;resolution tandem mass spectrometry (HRMS/MS) and global natural product social molecular networking platform (GNPS) analysis of fungus&#8208;bacterium co&#8208;cultures resulted in the identification of five madurastatin derivatives (A1, A2, E1, F, and G1), of which were four new derivatives. Chemical structures were unambiguously confirmed by HR&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS, 1D and 2D NMR experiments, as well as MS/MS data and their absolute structures were elucidated based on Marfey's analysis, DP4+ probability calculation and total synthesis. Structure analysis revealed that madurastatin E1 (2) contained a rare 4&#8208;imidazolidinone cyclic moiety and madurastatin A1 (5) was characterized as a Ga3+&#8208;complex. The function of madurastatins as siderophores was evaluated using the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans as model organism. Based on homology models, we identified the putative NRPS&#8208;based gene cluster region of the siderophores in Actinomadura sp. RB99.

Revealing a radical route: The radical reactivity of the biradical [&#8901;P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)2P&#8901;] has been investigated. It was possible to synthesize the persistent phosphorus&#8208;centered monoradical [&#8901;P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)2P&#8722;Et] and identify it as a radical intermediate during the addition of bromoethane to [&#8901;P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)2P&#8901;]. A possible stepwise mechanism of this reaction was formulated and is supported by both detailed quantum chemical calculations and experimental results.







Abstract
The activation of C&#8722;Br bonds in various bromoalkanes by the biradical [&#8901;P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)2P&#8901;] (1) (Ter=2,6&#8208;bis&#8208;(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)&#8208;phenyl) is reported, yielding trans&#8208;addition products of the type [Br&#8722;P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)2P&#8722;R] (2), so&#8208;called 1,3&#8208;substituted cyclo&#8208;1,3&#8208;diphospha&#8208;2,4&#8208;diazanes. This addition reaction, which represents a new easy approach to asymmetrically substituted cyclo&#8208;1,3&#8208;diphospha&#8208;2,4&#8208;diazanes, was investigated mechanistically by different spectroscopic methods (NMR, EPR, IR, Raman); the results suggested a stepwise radical reaction mechanism, as evidenced by the in&#8208;situ detection of the phosphorus&#8208;centered monoradical [&#8901;P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)2P&#8208;R].&lt; To provide further evidence for the radical mechanism, [&#8901;P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)2P&#8208;Et] (3Et&#8901;) was synthesized directly by reduction of the bromoethane addition product [Br&#8208;P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)2P&#8208;Et] (2&#8201;a) with magnesium, resulting in the formation of the persistent phosphorus&#8208;centered monoradical [&#8901;P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)2P&#8208;Et], which could be isolated and fully characterized, including single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Comparison of the EPR spectrum of the radical intermediate in the addition reaction with that of the synthesized new [&#8901;P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)2P&#8208;Et] radical clearly proves the existence of radicals over the course of the reaction of biradical [&#8901;P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)2P&#8901;] (1) with bromoethane. Extensive DFT and coupled cluster calculations corroborate the experimental data for a radical mechanism in the reaction of biradical [&#8901;P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)2P&#8901;] with EtBr. In the field of hetero&#8208;cyclobutane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyls, the demonstration of a stepwise radical reaction represents a new aspect and closes the gap between P&#8208;centered biradicals and P&#8208;centered monoradicals in terms of radical reactivity.

         <title>Identifying the Molecular Origins of Green BN&#8208;TADF Material Degradation and Device Stability via in&#8197;situ Raman Spectroscopy</title>

Terminal substituents and conformational changes have a great impact on OLED device efficiency and stability investigated by in&#8197;situ Raman spectroscopy. Compared to BN&#8208;PhOH with the lowest EQEmax of 19.0&#8201;% and LT50 of 1.7&#8197;h, BN&#8208;PhN(CH3)2 exhibited the longest OLED device lifetime (7.7&#8197;h), enhanced EQEmax of 24.1&#8201;%, and alleviated efficiency roll&#8208;off, as a manifestation of less conformational changes.







Abstract
There is little investigation into the impact of molecular conformation on device efficiency and degradation of boron&#8208;nitrogen thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters (BN&#8208;TADF). Herein, three highly&#8208;efficient green BN&#8208;TADF emitters have been designed to unveil the impact of peripheral phenyl groups on device efficiencies and lifetimes. Compared to BN&#8208;PhOH with the lowest EQEmax of 19&#8201;%, BN&#8208;PhOCH3 and BN&#8208;PhN(CH3)2 have achieved strongly enhanced EQEmax of 25.6&#8201;% and 24.1&#8201;%, respectively. Importantly, the device lifetimes (LT50) are dramatically improved from 1.7&#8197;h of BN&#8208;PhOH to 4.4&#8197;h of BN&#8208;PhOCH3 and 7.7&#8197;h of BN&#8208;PhN(CH3)2 without encapsulation. According to in&#8197;situ Raman spectroscopy and simulations, BN&#8208;PhN(CH3)2 of less conformation change after aging exhibits the best photostability. It is proposed that the torsion angle change between the BN core and the peripheral phenyl group results in BN&#8208;TADF degradation. This knowledge means precisely tuning peripheral groups of BN&#8208;TADF can achieve both higher device efficiencies and longer lifetimes.

Indole multi&#8208;site editing!! Unprecedented indole multi&#8208;site editing was accomplished by a unique ring&#8208;switch reaction of hemiaminals.







Abstract
This work reports the novel reactivity of hemiaminal as a precursor for indole editing at the multi&#8208;site. The HFIP&#8208;promoted indole editing of indoline hemiaminals affords 2&#8208;arylindoles through a ring&#8208;switch sequence. The key to success of this transformation is to use a cyclic hemiaminal as an &#945;&#8208;amino aldehyde surrogate under transient tautomeric control. This transformation features mild reaction conditions and good yields with broad functional group tolerance. The utility of this transformation is presented through the one&#8208;pot protocol and the synthesis of isocryptolepine.

         <title>The Unexpected Helical Supramolecular Assembly of a Simple Achiral Acetamide Tecton Generates Selective Water Channels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral channels with highly mobile water molecules result from the robust self&#8208;organization of a simple achiral acetamide. Fully reversible release and re&#8208;uptake of water molecules takes place near ambient conditions, with efficient water transport and a good selectivity against NaCl suggesting it to be an efficient candidate for desalination processes. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. van&#8197;der&#8197;Lee and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200383).

         <dc:description>
A blue&#8208;luminescent PtII complex bearing an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene changes luminescence color in response to the vapor atmosphere while maintaining its single crystallinity and luminescence intensity. The vapor&#8208;induced reversible and stepwise single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformations were elucidated by variable&#8208;temperature and continuous in&#8208;situ tracking of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements.

         <title>Tuning the Properties of 5&#8208;Azido and 5&#8208;Nitramino&#8208;tetrazoles by Diverse Functionalization &#8211; General Concepts for Future Energetic Materials</title>

Derivatization of 5&#8208;azido and 5&#8208;nitraminotetrazole with an azidoethyl, nitratoethyl or methyl group gives access to less acidic high explosives with versatile properties. Salt formation of the nitraminotetrazoles with nitrogen&#8208;rich and metal cations was performed to achieve less acidity, lower vapor pressure and higher thermal stability. The modification of the nitramino and azidotetrazole backbones show and nice way to tune the compounds&#8217; properties and are valuable for the design of future energetic materials.







Abstract
5&#8208;Azido and 5&#8208;nitraminotetrazole backbones are established heterocyclic motifs in the research field of energetic materials synthesis. Despite the high energy content of the compounds, the problem with many derivatives is that their sensitivities are far too high. Functionalization of one of the ring nitrogen atoms is the aim of this study to adjust the sensitivity by inserting nitratoethyl, azidoethyl and methyl groups. In this context, derivatives of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;azidoethyl)&#8208;5&#8208;nitraminotetrazoles (2, 2&#8201;a&#8211;2&#8201;d), as well as 1&#8208;nitrato and 1&#8208;azidoethyl substituted 5&#8208;azidotetrazole (7 and 10) and the methylation products of 5&#8208;azidotetrazole (5&#8208;azido&#8208;1&#8208;methyl&#8208;tetrazole, 11 and 5&#8208;azido&#8208;2&#8208;methyl&#8208;tetrazole, 12) were prepared. The obtained nitrogen&#8208;rich compounds were extensively characterized through multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and IR spectroscopy. The structural confinement was checked by X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments. The pure samples (verified by elemental analysis) were investigated regarding their behavior toward friction, impact (BAM methods) and electrostatic discharge as well as heating (DTA and DSC). For all metal&#8208;free compounds the detonation properties were computed with the EXPLO5 code using their density and heat of formation, calculated based on CBS&#8208;4&#8197;M level of theory.

         <title>Pulsed Laser Excited Photoacoustic Effect for Disease Diagnosis and Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pulsed laser excited photoacoustic effect is increasingly employed for the diagnosis and treatment of diverse diseases. Pulsed laser irradiation is observed to generate reactive species by photosensitization&#8208;free nanocapsules, which potentially broadens the scope of general photosensitizers via facile light mode switching from continuous to pulsed one. In this Concept article, the research status of pulsed laser excited disease theranostics is summarized to inspire novel methodologies and extra photoacoustic and photodynamic materials.







Abstract
Pulsed laser can excite light absorber to generate photoacoustic (PA) effect, that is, when the absorber is irradiated with pulsed laser, the absorbed light energy is converted into local heat to cause rapid thermoelastic expansion and generate acoustic wave. The generated PA signal has been widely employed for the diagnosis of many diseases with superb contrast, high penetrability and sensitivity. In addition, with the increase of pulsed laser energy, the resulting PA shockwave and cavitation can promote efficient drug release at lesion sites to potentiate the resulting therapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, the PA shockwave/cavitation can mechanically inhibit disease and produce reactive species.

     alt="Pulsed Laser Excited Photoacoustic Effect for Disease Diagnosis and Therapy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pulsed laser excited&lt;/b&gt; photoacoustic effect is increasingly employed for the diagnosis and treatment of diverse diseases. Pulsed laser irradiation is observed to generate reactive species by photosensitization-free nanocapsules, which potentially broadens the scope of general photosensitizers via facile light mode switching from continuous to pulsed one. In this Concept article, the research status of pulsed laser excited disease theranostics is summarized to inspire novel methodologies and extra photoacoustic and photodynamic materials.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulsed laser can excite light absorber to generate photoacoustic (PA) effect, that is, when the absorber is irradiated with pulsed laser, the absorbed light energy is converted into local heat to cause rapid thermoelastic expansion and generate acoustic wave. The generated PA signal has been widely employed for the diagnosis of many diseases with superb contrast, high penetrability and sensitivity. In addition, with the increase of pulsed laser energy, the resulting PA shockwave and cavitation can promote efficient drug release at lesion sites to potentiate the resulting therapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, the PA shockwave/cavitation can mechanically inhibit disease and produce reactive species. In this Concept article, the principle and research status of pulsed laser excited disease theranostics are briefly summarized, extra suggestions are proposed to inspire extensive PA probes and photodynamic materials as well as novel methodologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Promoted RhI&#8208;Catalyzed C2&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Alkenylation and Polyenylation of Imidazoles with Alkenyl Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A RhI&#8208;catalyzed C2&#8722;H alkenylation of imidazoles with alkenyl carboxylic acids with highly regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity is reported. This protocol merges C&#8722;H bond functionalization and the decarbonylation of carboxylic acids, accommodates a wide range of substrates with good compatibility of functional groups, and can be easily scaled.







Abstract
The first RhI&#8208;catalyzed, directed decarbonylative C2&#8722;H alkenylation of imidazoles with readily available alkenyl carboxylic acids is reported. The reaction proceeds in a highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective manner, providing efficient access to C2&#8208;alkenylated imidazoles that are generally inaccessible by known C&#8722;H alkenylation methods. This transformation accommodates a wide range of alkenyl carboxylic acids, including challenging conjugated polyene carboxylic acids, and diversely decorated imidazoles with high functional group compatibility. The presence of a removable pyrimidine directing group and the use of a bidentate phosphine ligand are pivotal to the success of the catalytic reaction. This process is also suitable for benzimidazoles. Importantly, the scalability and diversification of the products highlight the potential of this protocol in practical applications. Detailed experimental and computational studies provide important insights into the underlying reaction mechanism.

         <title>A Stereocontrolled Total Synthesis of Lipoxin B4 and its Biological Activity as a Pro&#8208;Resolving Lipid Mediator of Neuroinflammation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two stereocontrolled, efficient, and modular syntheses of eicosanoid lipoxin B4 (LXB4) are reported along with full spectral characterization of the natural product for the first time. Synthetic LXB4 exhibited significant neuroprotection in a cellular model of retinal ganglion cell survival assay. Our synthetic routes enable syntheses of new analogs and chemical probes for receptor and pathway identification.







Abstract
Two stereocontrolled, efficient, and modular syntheses of eicosanoid lipoxin B4 (LXB4) are reported. One features a stereoselective reduction followed by an asymmetric epoxidation sequence to set the vicinal diol stereocentres. The dienyne was installed via a one&#8208;pot Wittig olefination and base&#8208;mediated epoxide ring opening cascade. The other approach installed the diol through an asymmetric dihydroxylation reaction followed by a Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons olefination to afford the common dienyne intermediate. Finally, a Sonogashira coupling and an alkyne hydrosilylation/proto&#8208;desilylation protocol furnished LXB4 in 25&#8201;% overall yield in just 10&#8197;steps. For the first time, LXB4 has been fully characterized spectroscopically with its structure confirmed as previously reported. We have demonstrated that the synthesized LXB4 showed similar biological activity to commercial sources in a cellular neuroprotection model. This synthetic route can be employed to synthesize large quantities of LXB4, enable synthesis of new analogs, and chemical probes for receptor and pathway characterization.

         <title>Peroxynitrite&#8208;Promoted Persulfide Prodrugs with Protective Potential against Paracetamol Poisoning</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of novel persulfide prodrugs was designed and synthesized, which scavenged peroxynitrite in tandem during their activation. The 2&#8208;oxo&#8208;2&#8208;phenylacetamide triggers can first react with peroxynitrite and then initiate the release of persulfides, a second quencher of peroxynitrite. The prodrug intervention significantly reduced the intracellular concentration of APAP&#8208;induced peroxynitrite in HepG2 and alleviated the oxidative stress of H9c2 cardiac cells.







Abstract
The newly emerging persulfide prodrugs provide additional options for the profound study of persulfide, a fascinating molecule expected to intervene in biological functions and even diseases. Peroxynitrite is often the culprit in pathological processes characterized by oxidative stress, while the persulfide prodrug responsive to it is still pending. To enrich the family of redox&#8208;activated prodrugs, we designed prodrugs with a 2&#8208;oxo&#8208;2&#8208;phenylacetamide trigger, which achieved the release of persulfide via 1, 6&#8208;N, S&#8208;relay. The degradation of prodrugs and the formation of persulfides were confirmed to be peroxynitrite&#8208;responsible by the qualitative and quantitative studies based on LC&#8208;MS/MS methods and a spectrophotometry&#8208;based tag&#8208;switch strategy. Furthermore, these prodrugs showed potent peroxynitrite scavenging activity, cellular therapeutic potential against paracetamol poisoning in HepG2 and oxidative stress in H9c2, as well as desirable in vitro metabolic properties.

         <title>Chemo&#8208; and Regioselective Anionic Fries Rearrangement Promoted by Lithium Amides under Aerobic Conditions in Sustainable Reaction Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple, scalable, and sustainable access to salicylamides from O&#8208;aryl carbamates was achieved using lithium amides as easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle metalating agents under bench&#8208;type aerobic conditions. Tunable regioselective ortho&#8208; and lateral metalations in eco&#8208;friendly cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME) allow fast anionic migrations under air, with an unexpected beneficial contribution from biorenewable protic eutectic mixtures.







Abstract
A straightforward and efficient protocol to promote the metalation/anionic Fries rearrangements of O&#8208;aryl carbamates, using for the first time a lithium amide as metalating agent under aerobic/ambient&#8208;friendly reaction conditions, is reported. This approach enables the sustainable preparation of salicylamide derivatives with high levels of chemoselectivity within ultrafast reaction times, working at room temperature in the presence of air/moisture, and using environmentally responsible cyclopentyl methyl ether as a solvent. Furthermore, the regioselective manipulation of O&#8208;2&#8208;tolyl carbamates has been accomplished using interchangeably alkyllithiums or lithium amides, with an unexpected beneficial contribution from the employment of biorenewable protic eutectic mixtures as non&#8208;innocent reaction media.

         <title>Interfacial Charge Modulation via in situ Fabrication of 3D Conductive Platform with MOF Nanoparticles for Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

A novel photocatalyst was designed for CO2 reduction by assembling 3D GR with UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, aiming to construct a built&#8208;in electric field for charge separation. The composites show enhanced photocatalytic activity owing to improved distribution and exposure of absorption and reaction sites and redistribution of photogenerated carriers between 3D GR and UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2.







Abstract
Highly&#8208;efficient photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into valuable carbon&#8208;contained chemicals possesses a tremendous potential in solving the energy crisis and global warming problem. However, the inadequate separation of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs and the unsatisfied capture of CO2 stay the chief roadblocks. Herein, we designed a novel photocatalyst for CO2 reduction by assembling three&#8208;dimensional graphene (3D GR) with a typical metal&#8208;organic framework material UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, aiming to construct a built&#8208;in electric field for charge separation as well as taking advantage of the typical 3D structure of GR for maximizing the exposed absorption site on the surface. The performance evaluation demonstrated that the photocatalytic activity has been improved for the composite materials compared with that of the pure UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2. Further mechanism investigations proved that the enhanced photocatalytic performance is attributed to the synergy of enhanced CO2 absorption and inhibited photogenerated charge recombination, which could be owing to the better distribution and exposure of absorption and reaction sites on composites, and the redistribution of photogenerated carriers between 3D GR and UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2. This study provides a promising pathway to probe nanocomposites based on MOFs in environmental improvement and other relevant fields.

         <title>Biomimetic Peptide Catalytic Bond&#8208;Forming Utilizing a Mild Br&#248;nsted Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid phase biomimetic catalytic peptide synthesis utilizing mild Br&#248;nsted acid without microwave irradiation was successfully applied under mild conditions. This paper introduces two methods for the 2&#8211;4 mer oligopeptides bond formation for batch reaction and flow synthesis at room temperature using organic solvents with boiling points below 100&#8201;&#176;C. This flow production process proposes this new production method to overcome the limited scale&#8208;up production by reaction device scale.







Abstract
Since the global peptide drug market demand has been predicted to increase, highly efficient and inexpensive mass scale peptides are required. However, the production process raises questions about the cost of energy input, scale&#8208;up production, raw materials, and solvents treatment. This paper introduces 2 methods for the 2&#8211;4 mer oligopeptides bond formation for batch reaction utilizing 50&#8211;100&#8197;mol% of a mild Br&#248;nsted acid under the mild condition. One of the methods has been capably adapted to flow synthesis at room temperature using organic solvents with boiling points below 100&#8201;&#176;C. The method applies the tert&#8208;butoxycarbonyl amino methoxy group, forming the desired dipeptide without solvent at mild temperatures. Furthermore, the conversion of the carboxylic acid leaving the group to phenyl ester promotes peptide bond formation, and the reaction were applied to di, tri, and tetrapeptide bond formation in excellent yield without notable racemization at ambient temperature (up to &gt;99&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). Finally, this study proposes this new production method to overcome the limited scale&#8208;up production by reaction device scale: liquid phase biomimetic catalytic peptide flow synthesis utilizing a mild Br&#248;nsted acid.

         <dc:description>Owing to the unique catalytic, optical and magnetic properties  , lanthanides  (Ln) as multicomponent biomarkers, are widely used in the field of optical sensing, mass spectrometry and magnetic resonance imaging. As ligands, DNA molecules have good biocompatibility, high stability, cost efficiency, programmability and biodegradability. Based on the coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly between Ln ions (Ln  3+  ) and DNA molecules, a multifunctional Ln  3+  &#8208;DNA hybrid coordination polymers (CPs) were synthesized. Not only a series of different Ln  3+  (single Ln  3+  ) and DNA hybrid CPs were synthesized, but one hybrid CP contains two kinds of Ln  3+  was obtained. Besides, the synthetic CPs in cell fluorescence imaging and miRNA sensing also exhibited high performance. This work provides a novel idea for the synthesis of DNA based nanomaterials, which is promising for biologically&#8208;related applications.</dc:description>

         <title>When Aggregation Induced Emission Meets Perovskites: Efficient Defect&#8208;Passivation and Charge&#8208;Transfer for Ambient Fabrication of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intrinsic defects in perovskite film can serve as non&#8208;radiative recombination center to limit the performance and stability of metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The additive engineering in perovskite film is always applied to produce high&#8208;efficiency PSCs in recent years. Here, a typical donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) structured aggregation induced emission (AIE) molecule tetraphenylethene&#8208;2&#8208;dicyano&#8208;methylene&#8208;3&#8208;cyano&#8208;4,5,5&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;dihydrofuran (TPE&#8208;TCF) was introduced into perovskite film. The D&#8208;A structure of TPE&#8208;TCF molecule provided additional charge transfer channels, contributing to transporting electron of TPE&#8208;TCF&#8208;based device. The cyano (C&#8801;N) of TPE&#8208;TCF can interact with the uncoordinated Pb to from a relatively stable intermediate, PbI  2  &#8729;TPE&#8208;TCF, resulting in the slower crystal growth, reduced the defects at the grain boundaries and suppressed carrier recombination. As a consequence, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of TPE&#8208;TCF&#8208;modified PSCs achieved a remarkably enhanced from 15.63% to 19.66% with negligible hysteresis, which was prominent in methylammonium lead iodide&#8208;based devices fabricated under ambient condition. Furthermore, the PSCs modified by AIE molecule possessed an outstanding stability and maintain about 86% of the initial PCE after 300 hours storage in air at 25&#8208;35 &#176;C with a high relative humidity (RH) of &#8776;85%. This work suggests that incorporating AIE molecule into perovskite is a promising strategy for facilitating high&#8208;performance PSCs commercialization in ambient environment without glove box.</dc:description>

The cyano (C&#8801;N) of TPE-TCF can interact with the uncoordinated Pb to from a relatively stable intermediate, PbI  2  &#8729;TPE-TCF, resulting in the slower crystal growth, reduced the defects at the grain boundaries and suppressed carrier recombination. As a consequence, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of TPE-TCF-modified PSCs achieved a remarkably enhanced from 15.63% to 19.66% with negligible hysteresis, which was prominent in methylammonium lead iodide-based devices fabricated under ambient condition. Furthermore, the PSCs modified by AIE molecule possessed an outstanding stability and maintain about 86% of the initial PCE after 300 hours storage in air at 25-35 &#176;C with a high relative humidity (RH) of &#8776;85%. This work suggests that incorporating AIE molecule into perovskite is a promising strategy for facilitating high-performance PSCs commercialization in ambient environment without glove box.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;long Lived Luminescent Triplet Excited States in Cyclic (Alkyl)(amino)carbene Complexes of Zn(II) Halides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high element abundance and d  10  electron configuration make Zn  II  &#8208;based compounds attractive candidates for the development of novel photoactive molecules. Although a large library of purely fluorescent compounds exists, emission involving triplet excited states is a rare phenomenon for zinc complexes. We have investigated the photophysical and &#8208;chemical properties of a series of dimeric and monomeric Zn  II  halide complexes bearing a cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (cAAC) as chromophore unit. Specifically, [(cAAC)XZn(&#956;&#8208;X)  2  ZnX(cAAC)] (X = Cl (  1  ), Br (  2  ), I (  3  )) and [ZnX  2  (cAAC)(NCMe)] (X = Br (  4  ), I (  5  )) were isolated and fully characterized, showing intense visible light photoluminescence under UV irradiation at 297 K and fast photo&#8208;induced transformation. At 77 K, the compounds exhibit improved stability allowing to record ultra&#8208;long lifetimes in the millisecond regime. DFT/MRCI calculations confirm that the emission stems from  3  XCT/LE  cAAC  states and indicate the phototransformation to be related to asymmetric distortion of the complexes by cAAC ligand rotation. This study enhances our understanding of the excited state properties for future development and application of new classes of Zn  II  phosphorescent complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Assembly of &#603;&#8208;Keggin Polyoxometalate from Molecular Crystal to Zeolitic Octahedral Metal Oxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zeolitic octahedral metal oxides are inorganic crystalline microporous materials with adsorption and redox properties. New  &#949;  &#8208;Keggin nickel molybdate based zeolitic octahedral metal oxides are synthesized.  31  P nuclear magnetic resonance shows that reduction of Mo  VI  based molybdates forms  &#949;  &#8208;Keggin polyoxometalate that immediately transfers to solid phase. The formation process investigation indicates that low Ni concentration, insoluble reducing agent, and long synthesis time are the critical factors for obtaining the zeolite octahedral metal oxides rather than the  &#949;  &#8208;Keggin polyoxometalate molecule. The synthesized zeolitic nickel molybdate with Na  +  is used as the adsorbent, which effectively separates C  2  hydrocarbon mixtures.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient, metal&#8208;free, catalyst&#8208;free and solvent&#8208;free methodology for the reductive amination of levulinic acid with different anilines has been developed using HBpin as the reducing reagent. This protocol offers an excellent method to avoid solvents and added catalysts on the synthesis of different kinds of  N  &#8208;substituted pyrrolidones under metal free conditions. It is also the first report for the synthesis of different pyrrolidones by solvent&#8208;free as well as catalyst&#8208;free methods. The proposed mechanism for the formation of pyrrolidone has been supported by DFT calculations and control experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>The significant role of the atomic surface structure of support in strong metal&#8208;support interaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supported metal catalysts are important in many industrial reactions. It is reported that support materials are not always inert, and in some cases could even interact with metal nanoparticles (NPs) actively via various ways. In particular, the strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI), referring to metal NPs covered by support materials, affects catalysis at the active sites on the metal NP surface, which can serve as a very effective method in tuning and improving catalytic performance. By tailoring the support materials or controlling the treatment processes,  different kinds of SMSI, such as  classical SMSI, oxidative SMSI, wet&#8208;chemistry SMSI, and adsorbate&#8208;mediated SMSI  , can be achieved. This concept summarizes the general strategies to tune SMSI and discusses the key results. Moreover, a new proposal is presented to tailor SMSI by combining both the exposed facets of the support materials and external environments. Furthermore, we have discussed the challenges faced at present and provide useful insights for future research concerning this topic.</dc:description>

         <title>Dibenzophenazine based TADF emitters as dual electrochromic and electroluminescence materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Previous works reported the synthesis of donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor molecules based on dibenzophenazine acceptor group, presenting thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) properties and their application in the assembly of highly efficient electroluminescent devices. Herein, we focus on the characterisation of charge carrier species through UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR spectroelectrochemical and potentiostatic EPR techniques, in addition to the investigation of electropolymerisation properties of some compounds depicted in this study. The promising electrochromic features of both small molecules and conjugated polymers led to the assembly and investigation of electrochromic devices, evidencing the materials&#8217; versatility, applied in such different approaches as electrochromic windows and electroluminescent devices. Furthermore, the assembled OLEDs provided high efficiencies, with small roll&#8208;off, EQEs up to 20.5% and luminance values up to 85 000 cd/m  2  .</dc:description>

         <title>Chemically modified poly(A) analogs targeting PABP: structure activity relationship and translation inhibitory properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poly(A)&#8208;binding protein (PABP) is an essential element of cellular translational machinery. Recent studies have revealed that poly(A) tail modifications can modulate mRNA stability and translational potential, and that oligoadenylate&#8208;derived PABP ligands can act as effective translational inhibitors with potential applications in pain management. Although extensive research has focused on protein&#8208;RNA and protein&#8208;protein interactions involving PABPs, further studies are required to examine the ligand specificity of PABP. In this study, we developed a microscale thermophoresis&#8208;based assay to probe the interactions between PABP and oligoadenylate analogs containing different chemical modifications. Using this method, we evaluated oligoadenylate analogs modified with nucleobase, ribose, and phosphate moieties to identify modification hotspots. In addition, we determined the susceptibility of the modified oligos to CNOT7 to identify those with the potential for increased cellular stability. Consequently, we selected two enzymatically stable oligoadenylate analogs that inhibit translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysates with a higher potency than a previously reported PABP ligand. We believe that the results presented in this study and the implemented methodology can be capitalized upon in the future development of RNA&#8208;based biological tools.</dc:description>

         <title>Binding, Release and Functionalization of Intact Pnictogen Tetrahedra Coordinated to Dicopper Complexes</title>

         <title>Layered Uranyl Phosphonates Encapsulating Co(II)/Mn(II)/Zn(II) Ions: Exfoliation into Nanosheets and Its Impact on Magnetic and Luminescent Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layered heterometallic 5f&#8208;3d uranyl phosphonates can exhibit unique luminescent and/or magnetic properties, but the fabrication and properties of their 2D counterparts have not been investigated. Herein we report three heterobimetallic uranyl phosphonates, namely, [(UO2)3M(2&#8208;pmbH)4(H2O)4]&#183;2H2O [MU, M = Co(II), CoU; Mn(II), MnU; Zn(II), ZnU; 2&#8208;pmbH3 = 2&#8208;(phosphonomethyl)benzoic acid]. They are isostructural and display two&#8208;dimensional layered structures where the M(II) centers are encapsulated inside the windows generated by the diamagnetic uranyl phosphonate layer. Each M(II) has an octahedral geometry filled with four water molecules in the equatorial positions and two phosphonate oxygen atoms in the axial positions. The uranium atoms adopt UO7 pentagonal bipyramidal and UO6 square bipyramidal geometries. The lattice and coordination water molecules can be released by thermal treatment and reabsorbed in a reversible manner, accompanied with changes of magnetic dynamics. Interestingly, the bulk samples of MU can be exfoliated in acetone via freezing and thawing processes forming nanosheets with single&#8208;layer or two&#8208;layer thickness (MU&#8208;ns). Magnetic studies revealed that the CoU and MnU systems exhibited field&#8208;induced slow magnetization relaxation at low temperature. Compared with crystalline CoU, the magnetic relaxation of the CoU&#8208;ns aggregates is significantly accelerated. Moreover, photoluminescence measured at 77 K showed slight red&#8208;shift of the five characteristic uranyl emission bands for ZnU&#8208;ns in comparison with those of the crystalline ZnU. This work gives the first examples of 2D materials based on 5f&#8208;3d heterometallic uranyl phosphonates and illustrates the impact of dimension reduction on their magnetic/optical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical synthesis of the bioactive fragment of Salbutamol and derivatives in a self&#8208;optimizing flow chemistry platform</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The implementation of self&#8208;optimizing flow reactors has been mostly limited to model reactions or known synthesis routes. In this work, a self&#8208;optimizing flow photochemistry platform is used to develop an original synthesis of the bioactive fragment of Salbutamol and derivatives. The key photochemical steps for the construction of the aryl vicinyl amino alcohol moiety consist of a C&#8208;C bond forming reaction followed by an unprecedented, high yielding (&gt;80%), benzylic oxidative cyclization.</dc:description>

In this work, a self-optimizing flow photochemistry platform is used to develop an original synthesis of the bioactive fragment of Salbutamol and derivatives. The key photochemical steps for the construction of the aryl vicinyl amino alcohol moiety consist of a C-C bond forming reaction followed by an unprecedented, high yielding (&amp;gt;80%), benzylic oxidative cyclization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hierarchically Porous Poly(ionic liquid)&#8208;Organic Cage Composite Membrane for Efficient Iodine Capture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The effective capture of iodine with high volatility and poisonousness is significant for reprocessing the spent nuclear fuel. In this article, we report a hierarchically porous poly(ionic liquid)&#8208;organic cage composite membrane (PIL@CC3) possessing a gradient content distribution of CC3 cage crystals throughout the membrane to capture iodine vapor. The introduction of microporous CC3 can significantly enhance the uptake capacity of iodine up to 980 mg g  &#8208;1  , which is superior to that of a pristine PIL membrane carrying large meso&#8208; and macropores (99 mg g  &#8208;1  ), and CC3 crystalline powder (662 mg g  &#8208;1  ). Such enhanced performance benefits from the micro&#8208;meso&#8208;macroporous structure of the PIL@CC3 membrane in which the large meso&#8208; and macropores facilitate the mass transfer of iodine molecules from the external environment into the surface of the CC3 crystal, followed by diffusion of iodine molecules from the CC3 surface into the interior and exterior pores of the CC3 crystal. In addition, the asymmetric distribution of CC3 crystals across the PIL@CC3 membrane also displays its advantage in intercepting trace iodine, revealing its great potential for practical application. This study provides an idea for constructing hierarchically porous membrane composites for the removal of toxic vapors.</dc:description>

         <title>Relevance of Palladium to Radiopharmaceutical Development Considering Enhanced Coordination Properties of TE1PA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The limited use of palladium&#8208;103 and &#8208;109 radionuclides for molecular radiotherapy is surely due to the lack of appropriate ligands capable of fulfilling all criteria required for application in nuclear medicine. Furthermore, the thermodynamic properties of these complexes in solution remain difficult to establish. The challenge is compounded when considering that radiolabelling of compounds for translation to the clinical trials requires fast complexation. Thus, the coordination of Pd(II) and  103/109  Pd&#8208;nuclides is a huge challenge in terms of molecular design and physicochemical characterization. Herein, we report a comprehensive study highlighting TE1PA, a monopicolinate cyclam &#8211; already established in nuclear imaging with  64  Cu&#8208;PET (positron emission tomography) imaging tracers &#8211; as a highly relevant chelator for natural Pd and subsequently  109  Pd&#8208;nuclide. The structural, thermodynamic, kinetic and radiolabelling studies of Pd(II) with  TE1PA  , as well as the comparison of this complex with three structurally related derivatives, support palladium&#8208;  TE1PA  radiopharmaceuticals as leading candidates for targeted nuclear medicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis and Biological Applications of Peptidoglycan Fragments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The biosynthesis, breakdown, and modification of peptidoglycan (PG) play vital roles in both bacterial viability and in the response of human physiology to bacterial infection. Studies on PG biochemistry are hampered by the fact that PG is an inhomogeneous insoluble macromolecule. Chemical synthesis is therefore an important means to obtain PG fragments that may serve as enzyme substrates and elicitors of the human immune response. This review outlines the recent advances in the synthesis and biochemical studies of PG fragments, PG biosynthetic intermediates (such as Park's nucleotides and PG lipids), and PG breakdown products (such as muramyl dipeptides and anhydro&#8208;muramic acid&#8208;containing fragments). A rich variety of synthetic approaches has been applied to preparing such compounds since carbohydrate, peptide, and phospholipid chemical methodologies must all be applied.</dc:description>

Herein, we report a series of 2D porphyrinic metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheets (X&#8208;PMOF, X = F, Cl, Br), which was prepared from the self&#8208;assembly of a halogen&#8208;based porphyrin ligand X&#8208;TCPP (X&#8208;TCPP = 5&#8208;(4&#8208;halogenatedphenyl)&#8208;10,15,20&#8208;tris(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)&#8208;porphyrin) and ZrCl 4 in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid as the modulating reagent. The framework of X&#8208;PMOF possessed the ftw topology as in MOF&#8208;525. The lamellar X&#8208;PMOF nanosheets with the thickness of down to 4.5 nm were assembled and aggregated into flower&#8208;like morphology. With the introduction of iridium(III) atoms into the porphyrin rings, the resultant X&#8208;PMOF(Ir) nanosheets were prepared via the similar method. Catalytic results show that Br&#8208;PMOF(Ir) nanosheets were highly efficient for CO 2 reduction and aminolysis, giving rise to formamides in high yields under room temperature and atmospheric pressure, and can be recycled and reused for 3 runs. The total turnover number of Br&#8208;PMOF(Ir) after 3 runs was 1644 based on Ir. Mechanistic studies disclose that the high efficiency of Br&#8208;PMOF(Ir) nanosheets was ascribed to three factors, including the superior activation capability of iridium(III) porphyrin for Si&#8722;H bonds, more active sites on the external surfaces of Br&#8208;PMOF(Ir) nanosheets, and the defects caused by unsymmetrical porphyrin ligand that increased the framework&#8217;s affinity towards CO 2 .</dc:description>

         <title>Formal Umpolung Addition of Phosphites to 2&#8208;Azaaryl Ketones under Chiral Br&#248;nsted Base Catalysis: Enantioselective Protonation Utilizing [1,2]&#8208;Phospha&#8208;Brook Rearrangement</title>

         <dc:description>The formal enantioselective umpolung addition of dialkyl phosphites to 2&#8208;azaaryl ketones was developed under Br&#248;nsted base catalysis. The reaction involves the enantioselective protonation of the transient &#945;&#8208;oxygenated (2&#8208;azaaryl)methyl anion generated through the 1,2&#8208;addition of the anion of dialkyl phosphite to the 2&#8208;azaaryl ketone and the subsequent [1,2]&#8208;phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement. A chiral bis(guanidino)iminophosphorane organosuperbase efficiently catalyzed the reaction to provide enantio&#8208;enriched phosphates in high yields with good to high enantioselectivities. This is a rare example of the catalytic enantioselective protonation of transient carbanions other than enolates, constructing a trisubstituted stereogenic center &#945; to 2&#8208;azaarenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Perfluoroalkylation of C&#8208;H Bonds in (Hetero)arenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perfluoroalkylated (hetero)arenes represent an extremely important family of molecules commonly utilized in many areas such as medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry and material sciences. Due to their unique properties, they have attracted significant interest from synthetic chemists and various methods have been developed for their synthesis. Among them, the direct perfluoroalkylation of C(sp  2  )&#8208;H bonds in (hetero)arenes is one of the most attractive and straightforward ones, provided that it proceeds with high levels of regioselectivity. In this review article, a comprehensive overview of advances in this field is presented, with a special focus on the reaction mechanisms involved in these transformations and their regioselectivity. All methods available have been classified according to the nature of the perfluoroalkyl chain introduced, trifluoromethylation reactions being overviewed in a separate section, and to the nature of the reagents/catalysts required.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Triphenylphosphine photo&#8208;release from a sulfonamide azobenzene ruthenium&#8208;arene complex was exploited to activate Pd(II)Cl2  into Pd(0) catalyst, for the photo&#8208;initiation of Sonogashira cross&#8208;couplings. The transformation was initiated on demand &#8211; using simple white LED strip lights &#8211; with a high&#8208;temporal response and the ability to control reaction rate according to irradiation time. Various substrates were successfully applied to this photo&#8208;initiated cross&#8208;coupling, illustrating the wide functional group tolerance of our photo&#8208;caged catalyst activator, without a need for sophisticated photochemistry apparatus.</dc:description>

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Study of the Ni(II)&#8208; and Pd(II)&#8208;Promoted Double Geminal C(sp3)&#8211;H Bond Activation Providing Facile Access to NHC Pincer Complexes: Isolated Intermediates and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the first examples of metal&#8208;promoted double geminal activation of C(sp  3  )&#8211;H bonds of the N&#8211;CH  2  &#8211;N moiety in an imidazole&#8208;type heterocycle, leading to nickel and palladium NHC complexes under mild conditions. Reaction of the new electron&#8208;rich diphosphine 1,3&#8208;bis((di&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butylphosphaneyl)methyl)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1  H  &#8208;benzo[  d  ]imidazole (  1  ) with [PdCl  2  (cod)] occurred stepwise, first by single C&#8211;H bond activation yielding the alkyl pincer complex [PdCl(PC  sp3  H  P)] (  3  ) with two trans phosphane donors and a covalent Pd&#8211;C  sp3  bond. Activation of the C&#8211;H bond of the resulting &#945;&#8208;methine C  sp3  H&#8211;M group occurred subsequently when  3  was reacted with HCl to yield the NHC pincer complex [PdCl(PC  NHC  P)]Cl (  2  ). The reaction of  1  with [NiBr  2  (dme)] also afforded a NHC pincer complex, [NiBr(PC  NHC  P)]Br (  6  ), but the reactions leading to the double geminal C&#8211;H bond activation of the N&#8211;CH  2  &#8211;N group were too fast to allow identification or isolation of an intermediate analogous to  3  . The determination of six crystal structures, the isolation of reaction intermediates and DFT calculations provided the basis for suggesting the mechanism of the stepwise transformation of a N&#8211;CH  2  &#8211;N moiety in the N&#8211;C  NHC  &#8211;N unit of NHC pincer complexes and explain the key differences observed between the Pd and Ni chemistries.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spin&#8208;crossover complexes with multistep transitions attract much attention due to their potential applications as multi&#8208;switches and for data storage. A four&#8208;step spin crossover is observed in the new iron(II)&#8208;based cyanometallic guest&#8208;free framework compound Fe(2&#8208;ethoxypyrazine)  2  {Ag(CN)  2  }  2  during the transition from the low&#8208;spin to the high&#8208;spin state. A reverse process occurs in three steps. Crystallographic studies reveal an associated stepwise evolution of the crystal structures. Multiple transitions in the reported complex originate from distinct Fe  II  sites which exist due to the packing of the ligand with a bulky substituent.</dc:description>

         <title>[2.2]&#8208; and [3.3]Paracyclophane as bridging units in organic dyads for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven dye&#8208;sensitized hydrogen production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel donor&#8211;acceptor dyads containing [2.2]&#8208; and [3.3]paracyclophane (PCP) as the bridging moiety were synthesized and used to effectively fabricate dye&#8208;sensitized hydrogen production systems. All the prepared compounds had a phenothiazine and a cyanoacrylic acid/pyridinyl acrylonitrile moiety acting as an electron donor and acceptor, respectively. Although cyclic voltammetry measurements showed similar electron&#8208;donating properties among all the synthesized dyads, the lowest absorption energy of the [2.2]PCP moiety was lower than that of the [3.3]PCP one; this was due to its shorter distance between benzene rings, which could effectively drive the charge transfer between the donor and acceptor chromophores. Under visible light (&gt;395 nm), a dyad&#8208;loaded photocatalyst in a 0.5 M aqueous glycerol solution generated detectable hydrogen gases. The optimal turnover number and photocurrent order exhibited the same trend as the hydrogen production rate since the suggested number of excited photons played a critical role in hydrogen production.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;(tricyanoborane)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenate anion (  2  )&#160;was obtained in high yield by deprotonation of the B(CN)  3  &#8208;methylimidazole adduct&#160;  1  . Regarding charge and stereo&#8208;electronic properties, anion&#160;  2  &#160;closes the gap between well&#8208;known neutral NHCs and the ditopic dianionic NHC, the&#160;1,3&#8209;bis(tricyanoborane)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenate dianion (  IIb  ). The influence of the number of&#160;  N  &#8208;bonded tricyanoborane moieties on the &#963;&#8208;donating and &#960;&#8208;accepting properties of NHCs was assessed by quantum chemical calculations and verified by experimental data on&#160;  2  ,&#160;  IIb  , and 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#173;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;yilidene (IMe,&#160;  IIa  ). Therefore NHC&#160;  2  , which acts as a ditopic ligand via the carbene center and the cyano groups, was reacted with alkyl iodides, selenium, and [Ni(CO)  4  ] yielding alkylated imidazoles&#160;  3  &#160;and&#160;  4  , the anionic selenium adduct&#160;  5  , and the anionic nickel tricarbonyl complex&#160;  6  , respectively. The results of this study prove that charge, number of coordination sites, buried volume (%  V  bur  ) and &#963;&#8208;donor and &#960;&#8208;acceptor abilities of NHCs can be tuned effectively via the number of tricyanoborane substituents.</dc:description>

         <title>Dihydroxy&#8208;acid dehydratases from pathogenic bacteria: emerging drug targets to combat antibiotic resistance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is an urgent global need for the development of novel therapeutics to combat the rise of various antibiotic&#8208;resistant superbugs. Enzymes of the branched&#8208;chain amino acid (BCAA) biosynthesis pathway are an attractive target for novel anti&#8208;microbial drug development. Dihydroxy&#8208;acid dehydratase (DHAD) is the third enzyme in the BCAA biosynthesis pathway. It relies on an Fe&#8208;S cluster for catalytic activity and has recently also gained attention as a catalyst in cell&#8208;free enzyme cascades. Two types of Fe&#8208;S clusters have been identified in DHADs,  i.e.  [2Fe&#8208;2S] and [4Fe&#8208;4S], with the latter being more prone to degradation in the presence of oxygen. Here, we characterise two DHADs from bacterial human pathogens,  Staphylococcus aureus  and  Campylobacter jejuni  (  Sa  DHAD and  Cj  DHAD). Purified  Sa  DHAD and  Cj  DHAD are virtually inactive, but activity could be reversibly reconstituted  in vitro  (up to ~19,000&#8208;fold increase with  k  cat  as high as ~6.7 s  &#8208;1  ). Inductively&#8208;coupled plasma&#8208;optical emission spectroscopy (ICP&#8208;OES) measurements are consistent with the presence of [4Fe&#8208;4S] clusters in both enzymes. N&#8208;isopropyloxalyl hydroxamate (IpOHA) and aspterric acid are both potent inhibitors for both  Sa  DHAD (  K  i  = 7.8 and 51.6 &#181;M, respectively) and  Cj  DHAD (  K  i  = 32.9 and 35.1 &#181;M, respectively). These compounds thus present suitable starting points for the development of novel anti&#8208;microbial chemotherapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Deazaflavins Towards Highly Potent Reducing Photocatalysts Guided by Mechanistic Understanding &#8208; Enhancement of the Key Step by the Internal Heavy Atom Effect</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deazaflavins are well suited for reductive chemistry acting  via  a consecutive photo&#8208;induced electron transfer, in which their triplet state and semiquinone &#8208; the latter is formed from the former after electron transfer from a sacrificial electron donor &#8208; are key intermediates. Guided by mechanistic investigations aiming to increase intersystem crossing by the internal heavy atom effect and optimising the concentration conditions to avoid unproductive excited singlet reactions, we synthesised 5&#8208;aryldeazaflavins with Br or Cl substituents on different structural positions  via  a three&#8208;component reaction. Bromination of the deazaisoalloxazine core leads to almost 100% triplet yield but causes photo&#8208;instability and enhances unproductive side reactions. Bromine on the 5&#8208;phenyl group in ortho position does not affect the photostability, increases the triplet yield, and allows its efficient usage in the photocatalytic dehalogenation of bromo&#8208; and chloroarenes with electron&#8208;donating methoxy and alkyl groups even under aerobic conditions. Reductive powers comparable to lithium are achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfur and azobenzenes, a profitable liaison: straightforward synthesis of photoswitchable thioglycosides with tunable properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Azobenzene photoswitches are valuable tools for controlling properties of molecular systems with light. We have been investigating azobenzene glycoconjugates to probe carbohydrate&#8208;protein interactions and to design glycoazobenzene macrocycles with chiroptical and physicochemical properties modulated by light irradiation. To date, direct conjugation of glycosides to azobenzenes was performed by reactions providing target compounds in limited yields. We therefore sought a more effective and reliable coupling method. In this paper, we report on a straightforward thioarylation of azobenzene derivatives with glycosyl thiols as well as other thiols, thereby increasing the scope of azobenzene conjugation. Even challenging unsymmetrical conjugates can be achieved in good yields via sequential or one pot procedures. Importantly, red&#8208;shifted azoswitches, which are addressed with visible light were easily functionalized. Additionally, by oxidation of the sulfide bridge to the respective sulfones, both the photochromic and the thermal relaxation properties of the core azobenzene can be tuned. Utilizing this option, we realized orthogonal three&#8208;state photoswitching in mixtures containing two distinct azobenzene thioglycosides.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Transition metal borides (TMBs) containing B  n  &#8208;fragment (  n  &gt; 3) have recently gained interest for their ability to enable exciting magnetic materials. Herein, we show that the B  4  &#8208;containing TiFe  0.64(1)  Os  2.36(1)  B  2  is a new ferromagnetic TMB with a Curie temperature of 523(2) K and a Weiss constant of 554(3) K, originating from the chain of  M  3  &#8208;triangles (  M  = 64%Fe + 36%Os).

It belongs to the Ti  1+  x  Os  2&#8722;  x  RuB  2  &#8208;type structure (space group  P  6&#773;2  m  , no. 189) and contains trigonal planar B  4  boron fragments [B&#9472;B distance of 1.87(4) &#197;] interacting with  M  3  &#8208;triangles [  M  &#9472;  M  distances of 2.637(8) &#197; and 3.0199(2) &#197;].

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transition metal borides (TMBs) containing B  n  -fragment (  n  &amp;gt; 3) have recently gained interest for their ability to enable exciting magnetic materials. Herein, we show that the B  4  -containing TiFe  0.64(1)  Os  2.36(1)  B  2  is a new ferromagnetic TMB with a Curie temperature of 523(2) K and a Weiss constant of 554(3) K, originating from the chain of  M  3  -triangles (  M  = 64%Fe + 36%Os). The new phase was synthesized from the elements by arc-melting, and its structure was elucidated by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. It belongs to the Ti  1+  x  Os  2&#8722;  x  RuB  2  -type structure (space group  P  6&#773;2  m  , no. 189) and contains trigonal planar B  4  boron fragments [B&#9472;B distance of 1.87(4) &#197;] interacting with  M  3  -triangles [  M  &#9472;  M  distances of 2.637(8) &#197; and 3.0199(2) &#197;]. The experimental results were supported by computational calculations based on the ideal TiFeOs  2  B  2  composition, which revealed strong ferromagnetic interactions within and between the Fe  3  -triangles. This discovery represents the first magnetically ordered Os-rich TMB, thus it will help expand our knowledge of the role of Os in low-dimensional magnetism of intermetallics and enable the design of such materials in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>ThioCORMates: Tunable and Cost&#8208;Effective Carbon Monoxide&#8208;Releasing Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon monoxide&#8208;releasing molecules (CORMs), can offer a safer alternative to CO delivery than the use of CO gas cylinders. Upon treatment with an amine base,  S&#8208;aryl thioformates (&#8220;thioCORMates&#8221;) release CO nearly quantitatively at room temperature, a gas which can then be harnessed for carbonylative cross&#8208;coupling, biological study, or inorganic synthesis. These bench&#8208;stable molecules are easily synthesized from the corresponding thiophenol and can be electronically tuned to release CO at different rates&#8212;from less than 1 minute to greater than 1 hour&#8212;offering a practical alternative to existing CORM technology. Finally, isotopically labeled  13CO can be conveniently generated and used, with the thioCORMate synthesized from  13C&#8208;formic acid.</dc:description>
