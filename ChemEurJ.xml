         <dc:description>
This paper employs a jigsaw design to visually merge the concepts of spin and electrochemical energy storage, introducing the novel idea of spin&#8208;electrochemical energy storage. It discusses various mechanisms, modulation methods, spin state characterization techniques, and examines the future prospects and challenges, providing a comprehensive outlook on the development of this emerging technology.







Abstract
Developing high&#8208;capacity and cyclically stable transition metal (TM)&#8208;based electrode materials for energy storage devices, such as aqueous ion energy storage systems, is crucial for addressing the growing issue of energy scarcity. The spin state, or spin configuration of the d&#8208;electrons, plays a vital role in the electrochemical energy storage performance of these materials. However, there has been a lack of systematic descriptions regarding the role of spin configurations in electrochemical energy storage to date. This review aims to elucidate the advantages of controlling the spin states of metal centers to enhance energy storage performance and highlights recent progress in employing spin state regulation in electrochemical energy storage. Additionally, it covers the various characterization techniques used to determine spin states. Finally, we discuss the future prospects and challenges within this emerging field, with the aim of accelerating the development of spin&#8208;based electrochemical energy storage technologies. This review also seeks to provide clear and reliable directions for the design and preparation of novel energy storage materials.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Organic Photosensitizers Based on 2&#8208;(2&#8208;Aminophenyl)benzothiazoles for Photocycloaddition Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 68, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;aminophenyl)benzothiazole derivatives have been characterized for their photophysical properties and their triplet energies were determined by DFT calculations. Subsequent application of this new class of photosensitizer in visible&#8208;light [2+2] photocycloaddition reactions revealed a substituent effect on the catalytic efficiency. Mechanistic insights were obtained experimentally and by DFT calculations.







Abstract
We have studied 2&#8208;(2&#8208;aminophenyl)benzothiazole and related derivatives for their photophysical properties in view of employing them as new and readily tunable organic photocatalysts. Their triplet energies were estimated by DFT calculations to be in the range of 52&#8211;57&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, suggesting their suitability for the [2+2] photocycloaddition of unsaturated acyl imidazoles with styrene derivatives. Experimental studies have shown that 2&#8211;(2&#8211;aminophenyl)benzothiazoles comprising alkylamino groups (NHMe, NHiPr) or the native amino group provide the best photocatalytic results in these visible&#8208;light mediated [2+2] reactions without the need of any additives, yielding a range of cyclobutane derivatives. A combined experimental and theoretical approach has provided insights into the underlying triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer process.

         <title>Secondary Sphere Lewis Acid Activated Heme Superoxo Adducts Mimic Crucial Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions in IDO/TDO Heme Dioxygenases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 68, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heme superoxide model compound with secondary coordination sphere Lewis acid activation has been utilized for the rational mimicking of reaction mechanism of the therapeutically relevant IDO/TDO dioxygenase enzymes. Therein, a distinct reaction precursor complex has been characterized, drawing potential parallels to the analogous ternary complex of IDO/TDO dioxygenases.







Abstract
Heme enzymes play a central role in a medley of reactivities within a wide variety of crucial biological systems. Their active sites are highly decorated with pivotal evolutionarily optimized non&#8208;covalent interactions that precisely choreograph their biological functionalities with specific regio&#8208;, stereo&#8208;, and chemo&#8208;selectivities. Gaining a clear comprehension of how such weak interactions within the active sites control reactivity offers powerful information to be implemented into the design of future therapeutic agents that target these heme enzymes. To shed light on such critical details pertaining to tryptophan dioxygenating heme enzymes, this study investigates the indole dioxygenation reactivities of Lewis acid&#8208;activated heme superoxo model systems, wherein an unprecedented kinetic behavior is revealed. In that, the activated heme superoxo adduct is observed to undergo indole dioxygenation with the intermediacy of a non&#8208;covalently organized precursor complex, which forms prior to the rate&#8208;limiting step of the overall reaction landscape. Spectroscopic and theoretical characterization of this precursor complex draws close parallels to the ternary complex of heme dioxygenases, which has been postulated to be of crucial importance for successful 2,3&#8208;dioxygenative cleavage of indole moieties.

         <title>Investigation of Neighboring Group Participation in 3,4&#8208;Diacetylated Glycosyl Donors in the Gas Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 68, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neighboring group participation in 3,4&#8208;diacetylated glycosyl donors can generate two isomeric cations. By integrating infrared ion spectroscopy, isotope labeling and isomer population analysis, we resolved the spectra of isomeric mixtures and quantified the relative contributions of each cationic species.







Abstract
A key challenge in oligosaccharide synthesis is the stereoselective installation of glycosidic bonds. Each glycosidic linkage has one of two possible stereo&#8208;chemical geometries, &#945;/&#946; or 1,2&#8208;cis/trans. An established approach to install 1,2&#8208;trans glycosidic bonds is neighboring group participation (NGP), mediated by a 2&#8208;O&#8208;acyl group. Extension of this intramolecular stabilization to nucleophilic groups located at more remote positions has also been suggested, but remains poorly understood. Previously, we employed infrared ion spectroscopy to characterize the molecular ions of monoacetylated sugar donors and showed how the strength of the stabilizing effect depends on the position of the participating ester group on the glycosyl donor ring as well as on its relative stereochemistry. In this work, we investigated glycosyl donors carrying two acyl groups. Using isotope labelling and isomer population analysis we were able to resolving spectra of isomeric mixtures and establish the relative contribution of individual species. We conclude that 3,4&#8208;diacetyl mannosyl donors exclusively form a dioxanium ion as a result of C&#8208;3 acyl stabilization. In contrast, the glucosyl and galactosyl cations form mixtures of C&#8208;3 and C&#8208;4 acyl participation products. Hence, the combination of isotope labeling and population analysis allows for the study of increasingly complex glycosyl cations.

Electrophilic activation of an aromatic cyclo&#8208;P5 ligand drastically enhances its reactivity, opening new synthetic avenues in phosphorus chemistry. It allows for the selective functionalization at the 2&#8208;position of the cyclo&#8208;P5 ligand and leads to the yet unaccomplished contraction to a catena&#8208;P4 moiety. In contrast, when E1 (E=N, P) surrogates are used, aggregation of the cyclo&#8208;P5 ligand could be achieved, affording unprecedented P10&#8208; and P11&#8208;complexes.







Abstract
Electrophilic activation of the aromatic cyclo&#8208;P5 ligand in [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] is demonstrated to drastically enhance its reactivity towards weak nucleophiles. Unprecedented functionalized, contracted as well as complexly aggregated polyphosphorus compounds are accessed utilizing [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5Me)][OTf] (A), highlighting the great potential of this underexplored mode of reactivity. Addition of carbenes to A affords novel 1,2&#8208; or 1,1&#8208;difunctionalized cyclo&#8208;P5 complexes [Cp*Fe(&#951;4&#8208;P5(1&#8208;L)(2&#8208;Me)][OTf] (L=IDipp (1), EtCAAC (2), IiPr (3&#8201;b)) and [Cp*Fe(&#951;4&#8208;P5(1&#8208;IiPr)(1&#8208;Me)][OTf] (3&#8201;a). For the first time, the much smaller IMe4 leads to the contraction of the cyclo&#8208;P5 ligand and formation of [Cp*Fe(&#951;4&#8208;P4(1&#8208;IMe)(4&#8208;Me)] (4). DFT calculations shed light on the delicate mechanism of this type of reaction, which is reinforced by the experimental identification of key intermediates. Even the comparably weak nucleophile IDippCH2 reacts with A to form [Cp*Fe(&#951;4&#8208;P5(1&#8208;IDippCH2)(1/2&#8208;Me)][OTf] (6&#8201;a/b), highlighting its explicitly more reactive nature. Moreover, exposure of A to IDippEH (E=N, P) leads to a unique aggregation reaction affording [{Cp*Fe}2{&#956;2,&#951;4:3:1&#8211;P10Me2(IDippN)}][OTf] (8) and [{Cp*Fe}2{&#956;2,&#951;4:1:1:1&#8211;P11Me2(IDipp)}][OTf] (9), respectively.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Method for the Selective Synthesis of Amides and N&#8208;Acylureas from Carboxylic Acids and Thioureas</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 68, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the presence of a base and photocatalyst, thiourea undergoes deprotonation and a single&#8208;electron transfer process, subsequently leading to desulfurization and the formation of carbodiimide. Ultimately, the carboxylic acid reacts with carbodiimide, and can selectively produce amides and N&#8208;acylureas.







Abstract
In this work, we developed a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven method for the selective synthesis of amides and N&#8208;acylureas from carboxylic acids and thioureas. This protocol was featured as avoidance of additional oxidants and transition metal catalysts, simple manipulations, low cost, broad substrate scope, and good functional group tolerance. As only oxygen serves as the oxidation reagent, this method provides a promising synthesis candidate for the formation of N&#8208;aryl amides and N&#8208;acylureas, including late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex pharmaceutical molecules and biologically active molecules.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Electrolyte for Electrosynthesis: Scalable Anodically&#8208;Enabled One&#8208;Pot Sequence from Aldehyde to Isoxazol(in)es</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 68, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free one&#8208;pot electrochemical synthetic strategy, involving &#8220;in&#8208;situ electrolyte&#8221; generation, was developed. The concept of &#8220;in&#8208;situ electrolyte&#8221; for electrochemical transformations was demonstrated for the waste&#8208;reducing and cost&#8208;effective synthesis of high&#8208;value functionalized isoxazol(in)es. Chemical yields of up to 97&#8201;% are observed for a broad substrate scope.







Abstract
Electrochemical transformations are considered a green alternative to classical redox chemistry as it eliminates the necessity for toxic and waste producing redox reagents. Typical electrochemical reactions require the addition of a supporting electrolyte &#8211; an ionic compound to facilitate reaction medium conductivity. However, this is often accompanied by an increase in the amount of produced waste. Here, we report an &#8220;in&#8208;situ electrolyte&#8221; concept for facile, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, additive&#8208;free one&#8208;pot electrochemical preparation of isoxazol(in)es, important scaffolds for biologically active natural and synthetic molecules, from the respective aldehydes. The protocol utilizes no halogenated solvents and no external oxidants, while salt side&#8208;products provide the ionic conductivity necessary for the electrosynthesis. The electrolysis is performed in an undivided cell, using the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrodes for the chlor&#8208;alkali industry dimensionally stable and scalable mixed metal oxide anode and platinized titanium cathode of high durability. The cascade transformation comprises the condensation of aldehyde to oxime followed by its anodic oxidation and subsequent intra&#8208; and/or intermolecular [3+2] cycloadditions with an appropriate dipolarophile. Chemical yields up to 97&#8201;%, and good Faradaic efficiency, scalability, and stability are observed for most substrates in a broad scope.

         <title>Osmapentalenofurans Constructed by Reacting Os&#8801;C1 of Osmapentalyne with Phenols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 68, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article presents the efficient synthesis of osmapentalenofurans via the reaction of osmapentalyne containing Os&#8801;C1 with phenols, resulting in complexes with near&#8208;infrared luminescence. The TPE&#8208;derived osmapentalenofuran showed remarkable AIE properties, expanding the reactivity of these compounds and highlighting their potential in specialized functional materials and advanced luminescent applications.







Abstract
Over the past decade, significant research efforts have focused on osmapentalyne, characterized by the more reactive Os&#8801;C7 (Carbon atoms numbered in a clockwise direction on the osmapentalyne skeleton), across areas encompassing electrophilic, nucleophilic, and addition reactions.

&lt;p&gt;This article presents the efficient synthesis of osmapentalenofurans via the reaction of osmapentalyne containing Os&#8801;C1 with phenols, resulting in complexes with near-infrared luminescence. The TPE-derived osmapentalenofuran showed remarkable AIE properties, expanding the reactivity of these compounds and highlighting their potential in specialized functional materials and advanced luminescent applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, significant research efforts have focused on osmapentalyne, characterized by the more reactive Os&#8801;C7 (Carbon atoms numbered in a clockwise direction on the osmapentalyne skeleton), across areas encompassing electrophilic, nucleophilic, and addition reactions. Nevertheless, the reactivity of osmapentalyne featuring Os&#8801;C1 remains ripe for further exploration. In this investigation, we effectively synthesized a lineage of osmapentalenofurans through the nucleophilic reaction of osmapentalyne incorporating Os&#8801;C1 with phenols. These resulting complexes demonstrate near-infrared luminescence traits in both solid and liquid states. Particularly noteworthy is the osmapentalenofuran derived from tetraphenylethane (TPE) unit, which showcases remarkable aggregation-induced emission (AIE) property in the aggregated state. These osmapentalenofurans are also able to further extend their range of reactions, including reactions with base and isonitrile.

         <title>ZnH2P4N8: Case Study on Topochemical Imidonitridophosphate High&#8208;Pressure Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 68, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZnH2P4N8 was synthesized under elevated pressures and characterized by SCXRD, PXRD, SEM&#8208;EDX and NMR. The novel high&#8208;pressure deprotonation of phosphorus nitride imide polymorphs is a promising strategy for the specific preparation of future imidonitridophosphates and offers a significant increase in synthetic control. NMR studies on partially defunctionalized intermediates give insights on the local structure and the assumed reaction mechanism.







Abstract
Nitridophosphates are subject of current research, as they have a broad spectrum of properties and potential applications, such as ion conductors or luminescent materials. Yet, the subclass of imidonitridophosphates has been studied less extensively. The primary reason is that the controlled N&#8722;H functionalization of nitridophosphates is not straight forward, making targeted synthesis more challenging. Inspired by the high&#8208;pressure (HP) post&#8208;synthetic modification of nitridophosphates, we present the topochemical HP deprotonation of phosphorus nitride imides using the high&#8208;pressure polymorph &#946;&#8208;PN(NH) as an example. Additional incorporation of Zn2+ results in the first quaternary transition metal imidonitridophosphate ZnH2P4N8. The crystal structure was elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD), energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDX), powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) and solid&#8208;state magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MAS NMR). In addition, the presence of H as part of an imide group was confirmed by IR spectroscopy. The potential of this defunctionalization approach for controlling the N&#8722;H content is demonstrated by the preparation of partially deprotonated intermediates ZnxH4&#8722;2xP4N8 (x&#8776;0.5, 0.85). This topochemical high&#8208;pressure reaction represents a promising way to prepare, control and manipulate new imide&#8208;based materials without altering their overall anionic framework.

         <title>Neutral Adducts of Molybdenum Hexafluoride: Structure and Bonding in MoF6(NC5H5) and MoF6(NC5H5)2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 68, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molybdenum hexafluoride was shown to form Lewis acid base adduct with the organic base pyridine, the first neutral transition metal adducts beyond those of WF6. The MoF6(NC5H5) and MoF6(NC5H5)2 adducts adopt capped trigonal prismatic geometries. The trigonal prismatic MoF6 moiety in the adducts can be explained by the high electrostatic potentials of the square faces, where pyridine can coordinate.







Abstract
The first Lewis acid base adducts of MoF6 and an organic base have been synthesized, i.&#8201;e., MoF6(NC5H5) and MoF6(NC5H5)2. These adducts are structurally characterized with X&#8208;ray crystallography, showing that both adducts adopt capped trigonal prismatic structures. The MoF6(NC5H5) and MoF6(NC5H5)2 adducts are fluxional on the NMR time scale at room temperature. Two different fluorine environments could be resolved by 19F NMR spectroscopy at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C for the 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 adduct, MoF6(NC5H5)2, whereas MoF6(NC5H5) remains fluxional at that temperature. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations aide the assignment of the infrared and Raman spectra. Natural Bond Order and Molecular Electrostatic Potential analyses elucidate the structures and properties of the MoF6 pyridine adducts. Regions of significantly higher molecular electrostatic potential, i.&#8201;e., &#963;&#8208;holes, in trigonal prismatic compared to octahedral MoF6 rationalize the capped trigonal prismatic geometry of the adducts. Whereas MoF6(NC5H5) is stable at room temperature under exclusion of moisture, MoF6(NC5H5)2 decomposes at 60&#8201;&#176;C in pyridine solvent, and the solid slowly decomposes at room temperature after 24&#8197;h.

         <title>Hydroflux Synthesis and Structural Phase Transition of Rare&#8208;Earth Borate Hydroxides Na2[RE(BO3)(OH)2] (RE=Y, Gd&#8722;Er)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 68, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of rare&#8208;earth borates is crystallized from an ultra&#8208;alkaline NaOH hydroflux at moderate temperature. Pentagonal bipyramids centered by RE3+ cations form chains that are connected into layers by triangular (BO3)3&#8722; groups. Slightly above room temperature, the structure undergoes a second&#8208;order phase transition. Some of the compounds are photoluminescent under UV radiation.







Abstract
Reacting RE2O3 and H3BO3 in an ultra&#8208;alkaline NaOH hydroflux at about 250&#8201;&#176;C yielded pure, crystalline samples of Na2[RE(BO3)(OH)2] (RE=Y, Gd&#8722;Er). The compounds dehydrate to Na3RE(BO3)2 upon heating in air to about 500&#8201;&#176;C. Na2[RE(BO3)(OH)2] (RE=Tb&#8722;Er) are photoluminescent under UV radiation. Their UV&#8208;Vis spectra show the typical absorptions associated with 4f&#8211;4f transitions and absorption edges in the UV (band gaps &#8805;5.7&#8197;eV). The RE3+ cation is coordinated by seven oxygen atoms, which define a distorted pentagonal bipyramid. The bipyramids share trans&#8208;edges of their base forming infinite chains. Triangular (BO3)3&#8722; groups connect the chains into layers. The crystal structure of Na2[Ho(BO3)(OH)2] was investigated at various temperatures in the range 100&#8197;K&#8804;T&#8804;320&#8197;K. Above 310(2)&#8197;K, the compound crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Cmcm (&#946;&#8208;phase), below, it undergoes a displacive phase transition of second order resulting in a monoclinic structure in space group C2/c (&#945;&#8208;phase). The critical exponents derived from different structural parameters indicate a cooperative distortion of the borate layers, but a rather uncorrelated adaptation of the sodium cations to their local environment. The other compounds of the series also adopt the structure of the &#945;&#8208;phase at 296&#8197;K.

The critical exponents derived from different structural parameters indicate a cooperative distortion of the borate layers, but a rather uncorrelated adaptation of the sodium cations to their local environment. The other compounds of the series also adopt the structure of the &#945;-phase at 296&#8197;K.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reduced Surface Area for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Porous Electrode via Electrical Conductivity Relaxation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 68, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
(a) The ORR mechanism of porous LSCF consists of three processes: gas diffsuion (P1), surface oxygen exchange with small pores (P2), and surface oxygen exchagne with large pores (P3). (b) Gas diffusion effect is represented by the reduced surface area and increases (are decreases) with increasing surface area. Rchem and kchem decreases with increasing surface area.







Abstract
Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance of porous electrodes is critical for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). However, the effects of gas diffusion on the ORR in porous media need further investigation, although some issues, such as nonthermal surface oxygen exchange, have been attributed to gas diffusion. Herein, La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3&#8208;&#948; (LSCF) with various porosity, pore radii, and gas permeability were investigated via the electrical conductivity relaxation method and analysed via the distributed of characteristic time (DCT) model. The ORR is revealed with three characteristic times, which are gas diffusion, oxygen exchange via the surface corresponding to small pores, and oxygen exchange to large pores. Gas diffusion delays the oxygen surface exchange reaction, resulting in a very low chemical oxygen surface exchange coefficient compared with that obtained with dense samples under the assumption that all the surfaces are active for the ORR. Reduced surface area is thus defined to quantitatively represent the gas diffusion effects. The reduced surface area increases with increasing gas permeability, demonstrating the importance of electrode engineering for fast gas transport. Moreover, reduced surface area is suggested for replacing the specific surface area to calculate the electrode polarization impedance via the ALS model.

         <title>Innovative On&#8208;Resin and in Solution Peptidomimetics Synthesis via Metal&#8208;Free Photocatalytic Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 68, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work we studied an innovative peptidomimetic synthesis via metal&#8208;free photoredox approach, exploiting the reaction between dihydropyridines functionalized with amino acids (or peptide sequences) and differently functionalized imines. Furthermore, we successfully employed this methodology on solid phase peptide synthesis, obtaining peptides of different lengths and secondary structures, proving the success of this approach, even in a sterically hindered environment.







Abstract
Nowadays, peptidomimetics are widely studied, being useful tools in drug discovery and medicinal chemistry. The coupling between a carboxylic acid with an amine to form a peptide bond is the most common reaction to obtain peptides/peptidomimetics. In this work, we have investigated an innovative metal&#8208;free photoredox&#8208;catalyzed carbamoylation to form peptidomimetics thanks to the reaction between dihydropyridines functionalized with amino acids (or peptide sequences) and differently functionalized imines. As the organic photocatalyst, we used 4CzIPN, a donor&#8208;acceptor cyanoarene vastly used in photoredox catalysis. By easily modulating the amino acid (or peptide sequence), which is directly attached to the dihydropyridine, we proposed this key&#8208;reaction as new valuable method to obtain peptidomimetics, in&#8197;situ building the not&#8208;natural portion of the sequence. Moreover, we successfully employed this methodology in solid phase peptide synthesis, both inserting the new photoredox&#8208;generated amino acid at the end or in the middle of the sequence. Peptides with different lengths and secondary structures were prepared, proving the success of this approach, even in sterically hindered environment. Herein, to the best of our knowledge, we describe the first photocatalytic protocol which allows the building of the peptide backbone, with the possibility of simultaneously inserting a non&#8208;coded amino acid in the sequence.

         <title>A Comparative Study of a High&#8208;Pressure Polymorph of I2O5 and its Ambient&#8208;Pressure Modification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 68, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the high&#8208;pressure/high&#8208;temperature synthesis, crystal structure determination, and characterization of a new high&#8208;pressure modification of I2O5. The phase transition between the ambient&#8208; and high&#8208;pressure polymorph has been studied by temperature&#8208;dependent X&#8208;ray powder diffraction and volume&#8208;dependent DFT calculations.







Abstract
A hitherto unknown modification of I2O5 was obtained from high&#8208;pressure/high&#8208;temperature syntheses in a Walker&#8208;type multianvil device at 8&#8197;GPa and 250&#8201;&#176;C. HP&#8208;I2O5 crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system with space group P21/c (no.&#8197;14) with the unit cell parameters a=12.0612(3)&#8197;&#197;, b=4.8613(2)&#8197;&#197;, c=6.9585(2)&#8197;&#197;, &#946;=100.10(1)&#176; (at 173&#8197;K), and four formula units per cell. The single&#8208;crystal structure data are accompanied by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction data at ambient and elevated temperatures. Furthermore, DFT calculations were carried out to investigate the phase transition between the ambient&#8208;pressure polymorph NP&#8208;I2O5 to the newly synthesized high&#8208;pressure phase.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Ln&#8208;Doped Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks with Rare&#8208;Earth&#8208;Characteristic Long Persistent Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 68, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, Ln&#8208;doped hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) materials, which exhibit long&#8208;lasting and narrow&#8208;band LPL properties, were successfully synthesized through a facile method, offering novel solutions for color tuning of organic LPL materials.







Abstract
Tunable luminescence&#8208;assisted information storage and encryption holds increasing significance in today's society. A promising approach to incorporating the benefits of both organic long persistent luminescent (LPL) materials and rare&#8208;earth (RE) luminescence lies in utilizing organic host materials to sensitize RE luminescence, as well as employing F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) phosphorescence to RE compound luminescence. This work introduces a one&#8208;pot, in&#8197;situ pyrolytic condensation method, achieved through high&#8208;temperature melting calcination, to synthesize lanthanide ion&#8208;doped HOF materials. This method circumvents the drawback of molecular triplet energy annihilation, enabling the creation of organic LPL materials with RE characteristics. The HOF material serves as the host, exhibiting blue phosphorescence and cyan LPL. By fine&#8208;tuning the doping amount, the composite material U&#8208;Tb&#8208;100 achieves green LPL with a luminescent quantum yield of 56.4&#8201;%, and an LPL duration of approximately 2&#8211;3&#8197;s, demonstrating tunable persistence. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, spectral analysis, and theoretical calculation unveil that U&#8208;Tb&#8208;100 exhibits exceptional quantum yield and long&#8208;lived luminescence primarily due to the efficient sensitization of U monomer to RE ions and the PRET process between U and RE complexes. This ingenious strategy not only expands the repertoire of HOF materials but also facilitates the design of multifunctional LPL materials.

         <title>Discrete Macrocyclic Polymer Hosts&#8208;Induced Cascade Luminescence Enhancement and Application in Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 68, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of polymer, macrocycles and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) molecules brings infinite vitality to the construction of luminescent materials for bioimaging. Herein, we proposed discrete macrocyclic polymers hosts for assembling AIE molecules to induce cascade luminescence enhancement in water and to achieve desirable bioimaging performance via the cooperation of hydra&#8208;headed macrocycles containing two or three pillar[5]arene units, the block polymer F127 and AIE molecules.







Abstract
The integration of polymers, supramolecular macrocycles and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) molecules provides numerous possibilities for constructing various functional supramolecular systems. Herein, we constructed supramolecular assembled systems based on discrete macrocyclic polymer hosts via the cooperation of hydra&#8208;headed macrocycles containing two or three pillar[5]arene units (defined as P2, P3), the block polymer F127 and AIE molecules (alkyl&#8208;cyano modified tetraphenylethene, alkyl&#8208;triazole&#8208;cyano modified 9,10&#8208;distyrylanthracene, defined as TPE&#8208;(CN)4 and DSA&#8208;(TACN)2). Compared with the binary assembly between hydra&#8208;headed hosts or F127 and AIE molecules, cascaded supramolecular assembly&#8208;induced emission enhancement (SAIEE) in aqueous solution was achieved in discrete macrocyclic polymer&#8208;based supramolecular assembled systems. Considering the cascaded SAIEE performance, we have successfully applied discrete macrocyclic polymer&#8208;based supramolecular assembled systems to bioimaging and constructed an artificial light&#8208;harvesting system (LHs) to explore more potential applications. The supramolecular assembly form of discrete macrocyclic polymers hosts and AIE molecules proposed in this work provides new inspiration for the construction and application of high&#8208;performance supramolecular luminescent systems.

         <title>Photomediated Hexafluoroisopropoxylation of Unactivated Aryl Halides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 68, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild photochemical method has been developed for the synthesis of hexafluoroisopropyl aryl ethers, an underexplored functional group in medicinal chemistry. Unactivated aryl chlorides, bromides, and fluorides are efficiently engaged by this methodology, providing the products via a formal nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) process. Application of this reaction in late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactives has also been demonstrated.







Abstract
The use of fluoroalkoxy groups, such as trifluoromethoxy and 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethoxy groups, in pharmaceutical and agrochemical development has increased dramatically in recent years. However, hexafluoroisopropoxy groups have remained significantly under&#8208;represented, presumably due to limited synthetic methods for accessing this substituent in good yields. Herein, we report a mild, photochemical nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) approach for the synthesis of hexafluoroisopropyl aryl ethers from unactivated and abundant aryl halides. Notably, aryl chloride and bromide functionality are efficiently engaged by this methodology in addition to the traditional aryl fluoride nucleofuge. This method provided access to a diverse array of hexafluoroisopropyl aryl ethers, including multiple examples of late&#8208;stage functionalization of active pharmaceutical ingredients. A simple flow system was adapted for 10x scale&#8208;up, maintaining good yield for the reaction. Initial mechanistic studies indicate single electron oxidation of the arene as a key step in product formation.

         <title>Twist along Central C&#8722;C Bonds in a Series of Fully &#960;&#8208;Fused Propellanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 68, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twist in a series of &#960;&#8208;fused propellanes is investigated by both theoretical and experimental methods. A biphenyl&#8208;fused [4.4.4]propellane gives D3&#8208;symmetric enantiomers stable at 146&#8201;&#176;C, whereas naphthalene&#8208;fused [3.3.3]propellane and [4.3.3]hybrid show non&#8208;twisted form and fast twist inversion at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C between (P/M)&#8208;conformations, respectively. The twist is correlated with large changes of NMR chemical shifts and other physical properties.







Abstract
Without stereogenic carbon centers, organic molecules can be chiral when they have large energy barriers for conformational inversion. In this work, conformational behaviors are investigated for a series of tricyclic propellane skeletons with increasing 6&#8208;membered&#8208;ring peripheral moieties fused with aromatic rings. According to theoretical calculations, trinaphtho[3.3.3]propellane has three vertical naphthalene rings like triptycene shape without torsion along the central C&#8722;C single bond. On the other hand, hexabenzo[4.4.4]propellane shows hexaphenylethane&#8208;like ca. 60&#176; twist along the bond with large activation energy of 64&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for twist inversion because of the high congestion caused by three 6&#8208;membered&#8208;ring loops. Indeed, the [4.4.4]propellane gives a stable pair of chiroptical enantiomers toward heating at 146&#8201;&#176;C. By contrast, a hybrid [4.3.3]propellane exhibits fast interconversion between two twisted conformations even at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C.

A &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecule containing a hybrid system, in which aromatic rings are fused to the periphery of B4N4&#8208;heteropentalene, crystallizes into two polymorphs, both of which have one&#8208;dimensional &#960;&#8208;stacked columns, while exhibiting different photoconductive properties depending on the stacking geometries. Upon thermal vacuum deposition, this molecule forms an amorphous film that can serve as a host material for red phosphorescent OLEDs.







Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Electronic molecules with a BN&#8208;heterocyclic and carbon&#8208;based aromatic hybrid ring system (h&#8208;CBN) are interesting in that they potentially exhibit synergistic properties arising from the two different &#960;&#8208;systems. Here we report the synthesis and properties of a h&#8208;CBN&#8208;type molecule (1) having a bicyclic B4N4&#8208;heteropentalene core fused with extended aromatic rings. This molecule exhibits excellent chemical stability despite the absence of bulky substituents for kinetic protection, which in turn provides effective stacking of the &#960;&#8208;system upon crystallization. Depending on the crystallization solvent, 1 forms two polymorphs, i.&#8201;e., the &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;phases. While both phases have one&#8208;dimensional columnar structures, the &#960;&#8208;stacking geometries associated with the transfer integrals of the frontier orbitals are different, resulting in a twofold difference in the electrical conducting properties. We also found that upon thermal vacuum deposition, 1 gives an amorphous film, which serves as a host material for a red phosphorescent OLED device (maximum external quantum efficiency: 15.5 and 13.3&#8201;% at 0.1 and 2.5&#8197;mA, respectively).

Chiral fluorolactones A novel chiral sulfoxide&#8208;imine&#8208;olefin ligand is applyed to a rhodium catalyzed allylic substitution with monofluoro building block, resulting in high regio&#8208; and enantioselective fluorine containing allylic compounds which can be transferred to chiral fluorinated &#948;&#8208;lactones bearing vicinal stereogenic centers.







Abstract
Highly enantioselective Rh&#8208;catalyzed allylic substitution of the racemic branched allylic substrates with 2&#8208;fluoromalonate was realized enabled by a novel chiral sulfoxide&#8208;imine&#8208;olefin ligand under mild reaction conditions. The utilization of CuSO4 is beneficial for improving the enantioselectivity. Notably, the chiral fluoro&#8208;containing allyl products can be employed in a selective cyclic esterification to form chiral &#945;&#8208;fluorolactone bearing vicinal stereogenic centers.

A novel protocol for the efficient synthesis of benzofuro[3,2&#8208;d]pyrimidin&#8208;2&#8208;amines through a chemselective one&#8208;pot cascade [4+2] annulation/aromatization between benzofuran&#8208;derived azadienes and cyanamides has been described. The calculated studies well explained the chemoselectivity between carbodiimide anions and the isomerized cyanamide anions.







Abstract
The chemoselective [4+2] annulation/aromatization reactions between benzofuran&#8208;derived azadienes and N&#8722;Ts cyanamides are developed, affording a convenient method for synthesizing benzofuro[3,2&#8208;d]pyrimidin&#8208;2&#8208;amines under mild conditions. Herein, N&#8722;Ts cyanamides participated in reactions selectively via carbodiimide anion intermediates and the corresponding cyanamide anion intermediates derived products were not observed. The proposed chemoselective stepwise reaction mechanism was well supported by DFT calculations.

         <title>Photoinduced Metal&#8208;Free Decarboxylative Fluoroalkylation of Alkenes for the Synthesis of N&#8208;Arylbutanamides and Oxindoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 68, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new photoinduced decarboxylative difluoroalkylation&#8208;carbocyclization reaction of alkenes for the divergent construction of CF2&#8208;containing oxindoles and N&#8208;arylbutanamides was established. This photocatalysis reaction features simple conditions, transition metal photocatalysts free.







Abstract
The visible light&#8208;induced decarboxylative cascade reaction of fluoroalkyl carboxylic acids has been achieved for the efficient synthesis of fluorinated compounds. However, most of the transformations rely on noble iridium metal complex. Herein, a visible light&#8208;induced metal&#8208;free decarboxylative cascade reaction of fluoroalkyl carboxylic acids has been realized. This protocol features simple operation, transition metal free, and good functional group tolerance.

         <title>Controlling the Helical Pitch of Foldamers through Terminal Functionality: A Solid State Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 68, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystallographic study into the influence of varying the terminal functionality on the helical pitch of a series of foldamers is reported. Herein, we show that through systematic modification of the terminal functionality in the foldamer, from carboxylbenzyl (Cbz), diphenylamide (N(Ph)2), ferrocene to tert&#8208;butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) helical pitches between 3.4&#8211;7.3&#8197;&#197; can be readily accessed in these supramolecular scaffolds.







Abstract
Developing new methods to control the size and shape of the helical structures adopted by foldamers is highly important as the secondary structure displayed by these supramolecular scaffolds often dictates their activity and function. Herein, we report on a systematic study demonstrating that the helical pitch of ortho&#8208;azobenzene/2,6&#8208;pyridyldicarboxamide foldamers can be readily controlled through the nature of the terminal functionality. Remarkably, simply through varying the end group of the foldamer, and without modifying any other structural features of the scaffold, the helical pitch can be over doubled in magnitude (from 3.4&#8197;&#197;&#8211;7.3&#8197;&#197;). Additionally, crystallographic analysis of a library ten foldamers has identified general trends in the influence of a range of terminal functionalities, including carboxylbenzyl (Cbz), diphenylcarbamyl (N(Ph)2), ferrocene (Fc) and tert&#8208;butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), in controlling the folding behaviour of these supramolecular scaffolds. These studies could prove useful in the future development of functional foldamers which adopt specific sizes and shapes.

         <title>Complexes of a Frustrated Lewis Pair&#8208;Supported P(&#8722;1) Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 68, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zinc complex of a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP)&#8208;supported P(&#8722;1) ligand is presented. This Zn complex allows access to various other P(&#8722;1)&#8208;ligated species through transmetallation. Additionally, the reaction of an FLP&#8208;chelated P(+1) compound with Na[Co(CO)4] leads to an &#951;2&#8208;phosphaborene complex which is isoelectronic to &#951;2&#8208;olefin complexes.







Abstract
Several complexes of the intramolecular frustrated Lewis pair (FLP)&#8208;supported P(&#8722;1) ligand [iPr2P(C6H4)BCy2{P}]&#8722; are presented (Cy=cyclohexyl). Chief among these is the first example of a monomeric zinc bis(phosphido) complex, which was synthesized as a potential precursor for the solution&#8208;phase deposition of Zn3P2. While this goal was ultimately unsuccessful, the Zn(II) complex acts as a convenient springboard to other metal phosphide species via transmetallation: affording a tellurium bis(phosphido) complex and a formal adduct of the phosphorus subhalide PPCl2. Trapping experiments show that the PPCl2 adduct can also be prepared directly through the in&#8197;situ reduction of PCl3 in the presence of an intramolecular FLP ligand. Lastly, we report a formal &#951;2&#8208;phosphaborene complex of cobalt(&#8722;1) which is isoelectronic to olefin complexes, and explore its bonding via density functional theory (DFT) computations.

         <title>Ferrocenyl Dithiophosphonate Ag(I) Complexes: Synthesis, Structures, Luminescence, and Electrocatalytic Water Splitting Tuned by Nuclearity and Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 68, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of heterometallic mono&#8208; and di&#8208;nuclear Ag(I) ferrocenyl dithiophosphonates with various alkyl chains were characterized, and fluorescence emission at RT was detected for the first time with effective quantum yields. The HER activity reveals the impact of metallic nuclearity and peripheral ligand engineering. The electrolytic results with the proposed mechanism were supported by the DFT study and established a link between molecular structures and their physical and HER catalytic properties, advancing the field of renewable energy resources.







Abstract
The heterometallic [Ag(I)/Fe(II)] molecular electrocatalysts for hydrogen production were introduced here to recognize the mutual role of metallic nuclearity and ligand engineering. A series of ferrocenyl dithiophosphonate stabilized mononuclear [Ag(PPh3)2{S2PFc(OR)}] {where R=Me (1), Et (2), nPr (3), iPr (4), iAmyl (5); Fc=Fe (&#627;5&#8208;C5H4) (&#627;5&#8208;C5H5)} and dinuclear [Ag(PPh3){S2PFc(OR}]2 {where R=Et (2&#8201;a), and nPr (3&#8201;a)} complexes were synthesized and characterized by SCXRD, NMR (31P and 1H), ESI&#8208;MS, UV&#8208;Vis, and FT&#8208;IR spectroscopy. The comparative electrocatalytic HER behavior of 1&#8211;5 and 2&#8201;a&#8211;3&#8201;a showed effective current density of 1&#8197;mA/cm2 with overpotentials ranging from 772 to 991&#8197;mV, demonstrating the influence of extended and branched carbon chains in dithiophosphonates and metallic (mono&#8208;/di&#8722;) nuclearity, which correlates with documented tetra&#8208;nuclear [Ag4(S2PFc(OnPr)4], 6. DFT study suggests the coordinated (&#956;1&#8208;S) site of ligands is the reactivity center and the adsorption energy of intermediate [H*&#8208;SM] varies with the engineering of ligand and nuclearity. A catalytic mechanism using mononuclear (1) and di&#8208;nuclear (2&#8201;a) was proposed with the assistance of DFT. Each complex, being the first example of Ag(I) dithiophosphonates, exhibits intense photoluminescence with high quantum yields ranging from 33&#8201;% to 67&#8201;%. These results link the lower nuclearity structures to their physical and catalytic properties.

         <title>Glycerol as Reaction Medium for Sonogashira Couplings: A Green Approach for the Synthesis of New Triarylamine&#8208;Based Materials with Potential Application in Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 68, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, we present an innovative method using glycerol as a green solvent for Sonogashira reactions, achieving high yields for the synthesis of triphenylamine derivatives. Compared to traditional organic solvents, glycerol accelerates reaction times and simplifies product purification. This versatile approach tolerates diverse functional groups opening new avenues for sustainable syntheses of functional materials with potential applications in optoelectronics.







Abstract
This study focuses on the design, eco&#8208;friendly synthesis, and characterization of several novel three&#8208;legged triphenylamine derivatives. By performing Sonogashira couplings of functionalized aryl iodides with tris(4&#8208;ethynylphenyl)amine in glycerol, a readily available bio&#8208;derived solvent, we achieved the synthesis of target products in short times and high yields, up to 94&#8201;%, with consistently lower E&#8208;factors and reduced costs compared to standard conditions using toluene as the reaction medium. The target molecules possess a D&#8208;(&#960;&#8208;A)&#8323; or D&#8208;(&#960;&#8208;D)&#8323; structure, where an electron&#8208;donating core connects to three electron&#8208;donating (D) or electron&#8208;accepting (A) peripheral aromatic subunits through an acetylene spacer. Their main optical and electronic properties have been determined experimentally and by DFT simulations and suggest a possible implementation in energy conversion technologies such as luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) and perovskite solar cells (PSCs).

         <title>Photoresponsive Dioxazaborocanes&#8208;Containing Oligomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 68, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new synthetic methodology for the preparation of photoresponsive oligomers containing dioxazaborocanes is developed from &#946;&#8208;aminodiols and a bis&#8208;borylated dithienylethene photochromic unit. Their photophysical properties are evaluated, as well as their suitability for the preparation of spin&#8208;coated films whose photomechanical behavior is assessed.







Abstract
The synthetic methodology for the preparation of photoresponsive dioxazaborocanes&#8208;containing oligomers is developed. It relies on the transformation of the (diisopropylamino)boryl group (&#8722;BH(NiPr2)) into a dioxazaborocane unit in the presence of &#946;&#8208;aminodiols and involves a bis&#8208;borylated dithienylethene photochromic unit. The photophysical properties of the obtained oligomers are evaluated as well as their processability for the preparation of spin&#8208;coated films. The photomechanical behavior of the resulting films is assessed via displacement tracking profile.

         <title>Columnar Organization of Nonalternant Fluorinated Dehydrobenzannulenes</title>

I'm still stacking! Partially fluorinated dehydrobenzannulene macrocycles have been synthesized using a combination of Pd&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira couplings and oxidative alkyne dimerizations. They stack into extended slipped columns despite their low symmetry which prevents full electronic self&#8208;complementarity. These stacking arrangements are mediated by slipped [&#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;] interactions between fluorinated arene rings and fluoroarene&#8208;arene short contacts. Computations suggest that this assembly is dispersion&#8208;driven.







Abstract
Two new partially fluorinated dehydrobenzannulenes have been prepared by inter&#8208; and intramolecular oxidative homocoupling of diyne precursors. These systems contain fluorinated and nonfluorinated arene rings in a desymmetrized non&#8208;alternant arrangement. Both macrocycles are roughly planar and organize into extended columns in the solid state. The assembly of these columns is mediated by the combination of dispersion interactions, slipped [&#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;] stacking interactions of the perfluorinated rings with each other, and their association with the nonfluorinated rings in the molecules of the neighboring macrocycles. These results suggest that partial fluorination of dehydrobenzannulenes can serve as a versatile motif for their assembly into columnar superstructures.

         <title>Visible Light Promoted de Mayo Type Reaction of Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 68, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first de Mayo&#8208;type reaction of bicyclobutanes has been successfully achieved via triplet energy transfer photocatalysis. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the reaction proceeds through a [2&#960;+2&#963;]&#8208;retro&#8208;aldol cascade, culminating in syn&#8208;specific difunctionalization butanes.







Abstract
We reported herein a visible light mediated de Mayo&#8208;type reaction between 1,3&#8208;diketones and BCB. The reaction proceeds through a [2&#960;+2&#963;] cycloaddition and retro&#8208;aldol sequence, producing cis&#8208;difunctionalized cyclobutanes in high yields with good regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity.

         <title>Assay for Characterizing Adsorption&#8208;Properties of Surfaces (APS)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 68, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With APS the types of interactions can be determined causing adsorption of analytes to surfaces, driven by partition of analytes between the sample liquid and the solid surface having contact with the sample liquid. This is especially helpful for estimation of analyte loss occurring by their binding to surfaces during sample preparation and analysis and for developing measures for minimizing loss of analytes. The test is based on the quantification of probes consisting of thousands of defined peptides spanning a broad range of chemical properties. Interpretation of APS results is facilitated by an automated script&#8208;based analysis.







Abstract
Analytes, from sample preparation, until entering an analytical instrument, are prone to adsorb to surfaces, driven by the chemical properties of the surface and the liquids they are dissolved in. This problem can be addressed with internal standards when a single or few known analytes are quantified that are usually not available in omics. However, minimal to no loss of analytes is the aim. Here, we present a novel assay for qualifying and quantifying interactions responsible for adsorption of molecules to surfaces (APS) by using LC&#8211;MS/MS&#8208;based differential quantitative analysis. To reflect a broad range of chemical interactions with surfaces, a reference mixture of thousands of tryptic peptides, with known compositions was selected, representing a variety of different chemical characteristics. The assay was tested by investigating the adsorption properties of several different vials with different surface chemistries. A significant number of hydrophobic peptides adsorbed to conventional polypropylene vials. In contrast, only few peptides adsorbed to polypropylene vials, assigned as low&#8208;protein&#8208;binding. The highest number of peptides adsorbed to glass vials driven by electrostatic interactions. In summary, the new assay is suitable to characterize adsorption properties of different surfaces and to approximate the loss of analytes during sample preparation.

         <title>Copper(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Amination of Aryl Chlorides in Aqueous Ammonia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 68, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new CuII&#8208;catalyzed system for the amination of aryl chlorides in aqueous ammonia was developed. System optimization allowed for the use of phenanthroline&#8208;like ligand and achievement of adequate substrate scope for the production of anilines. Experimental and computational mechanistic evaluation argue for an unusual copper assisted radical mediated nucleophilic substitution pathway, in which deprotonation of an ammine ligand plays crucial role.







Abstract
Anilines are ubiquitous in bio&#8208;active compounds and their synthesis can be achieved via metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions involving aryl halides. We describe an unusual, yet simple, CuII&#8208;catalyzed system for the amination of aryl chlorides in pure aqueous ammonia with 2.5&#8197;mol&#8201;% catalyst loading under non&#8208;inert conditions. Different from previous systems, the reaction proceeds even without an additional organic solvent. Copper(II) sulfate in combination with 4,7&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline enabled the amination of several aryl chlorides containing electron&#8208;neutral, &#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing groups to the corresponding anilines with good to excellent yields. The upscaling potential of the procedure has been shown by the synthesis at 50&#8197;mmol scale. The reaction proceeds as one of the rare cases of a CuII&#8208;assisted coupling, in contrast to the typical CuI&#8722;CuIII intermediates postulated for most Ullmann&#8208;type coupling reactions. The copper(II) center allows for a nucleophilic substitution pathway, enabled by the deprotonation of coordinated ammonia.

         <title>Halogen Bonding in N&#8208;Alkyl&#8208;Bromo&#8208;/Lodo&#8208;Pyridinium Salts and its Application in Chromatography</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 68, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Para&#8208; and meta&#8208;halogenated pyridinium cations exhibit a high propensity for halogen bonding towards their anions, which we demonstrated by x&#8208;ray crystallography and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. Due to the high stability of the meta&#8208;halogenated derivatives against nucleophilic attack and even 0.1&#8197;M NaOH, the 3&#8208;iodopyridinium moiety was grafted onto a polymer and successfully employed in affinity chromatography of different proteins.







Abstract
The alkylation of 3&#8208;/4&#8208;bromo&#8208; and &#8208;iodopyridine with methyl triflate smoothly affords the corresponding N&#8208;methylpyridinium triflate salts. An anion exchange with NaI or [PPh4]Y (Y=Cl, Br, I) yields the corresponding halide salts. Most of them could be structurally characterized and their strong halogen bonds were investigated. While the halogen atom of 4&#8208;halogenopyridinium is susceptible to nucleophilic substitution, 3&#8208;halogenopyridinium ions are far more stable against nucleophilic attacks. Due to the comparable interaction strength of halogen bonds and hydrogen bonds, the latter of which is widely used in chromatography, the potential of 3&#8208;halogenopyridinium moieties for an application in chromatography is obvious and was successfully employed in affinity chromatography of different proteins.

         <title>Synthesis, Reactivity, and Bonding Analysis of a Tetracoordinated Nickel Carbene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 68, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isolation of a four&#8208;coordinate triphosphine nickel carbene complex challenges the generally accepted idea that low coordination numbers are required to stabilize M=C double bonds at late transition metal centers. The isolated compound displays nucleophilic and carbene&#8208;transfer reactivity. Computational analyses shed light on the unexpected role of the third phosphine in stabilizing the Ni=C fragment.







Abstract
Nickel carbenes are key reactive intermediates in the catalytic cyclopropanation of olefins and other reactions, but isolated examples are scarce and generally rely on low coordination numbers (&#8804;3) to stabilize the metal&#8722;ligand multiple bond. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a stable tetracoordinated nickel carbene bearing a triphosphine pincer ligand. Its nucleophilic character is evidenced by reaction with acids, and it can transfer the carbene fragment to CO to form a ketene. A computational study of the Ni=C chemical bond sheds light on the role of the third phosphine in the pincer framework to the stabilization of the nickel carbene fragment.

         <title>Membrane&#8208;free Electrolysis Production of Hydrogen Peroxide on Low&#8208;cost Metal&#8208;free Electrocatalysts for Dye Degradation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 68, December 5, 2024. </description>

The dilute H2O2 solution could be produced in a flow cell with membrane&#8208;free single electrolyte system by the paired electrolysis over metal&#8208;free h&#8208;BN@C anodes and BP&#8208;2000&#8208;SO3H carbon cathodes, with an overall Faradaic efficiency of 97&#8201;% and a H2O2 production rate of 1872&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. These dilute H2O2 solution could be conveniently taken and directly degrade dyes in water.







Abstract
The efficient production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) solution was achieved by combining cathodic two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction (2e&#8722; ORR) and anodic two&#8208;electron water oxidation (2e&#8722; WOR) in two half&#8208;reaction cells. h&#8208;BN loaded on carbon fibers (h&#8208;BN@C) is prepared and employed as an anode material to catalyze 2e&#8722; WOR, while sulfonated commercial BP&#8208;2000 carbons (BP&#8208;2000&#8208;SO3H) were prepared as the cathode materials for 2e&#8722; ORR. In a 2&#8197;M KHCO3 solution, an overall Faradaic efficiency of 97&#8201;% and a total H2O2 production rate of 1872&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 over metal&#8208;free electrodes were accomplished in a membrane&#8208;free flow cell. The dilute H2O2 solution could be directly used to degrade Rhodamine B, methyl blue and methylene orange dyes in water. This work proved low&#8208;cost production of dilute H2O2 solution in simple membrane&#8208;free flow cells with single electrolyte and on&#8208;site utilization for efficient dye degradation.

         <title>Bifunctional Hexadentate Pyclen&#8211;Based Chelating Agent for Mild Radiofluorination in Aqueous Solution at Room Temperature with a Ga&#8208;18F Ternary Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 68, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two pyclen&#8208;based Ga3+ complexes resolved by X&#8208;Ray crystallography showed a heptacoordination ability deviating from the recognized hexacoordination. This feature supports the suitability of these chelating agents for the Ga&#8208;18F species. Radiolabeling by coordination of Ga&#8208;18F was successfully achieved in water and at pH&#8197;5, at room temperature, with 86&#8201;% radioconversion in 20&#8197;minutes and a radiochelate stability demonstrated for at least one hour.







Abstract
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is used in oncology for tumor diagnosis, commonly relying on fluorine&#8208;18 (18F) emission detection. The conventional method of 18F incorporation on to probes by covalent bonding is harsh for sensitive biomolecules, which are nonetheless compounds of choice for the development of targeted probes. This study explores gallium&#8211;18F (Ga18F) coordination, a milder alternative method occurring in aqueous media at the final stage of radiosyntheses. Pyclen&#8208;based chelating agents were proposed to capture (GaF) species at room temperature and pH&#8805;5 making the radiofluorination process compatible with heat&#8208; and acid&#8208;sensitive biomolecules. Highly promising results were obtained with the PC2A&#8211;based chelating agent LH2 derived from the new bifunctional PC2A&#8211;OAE&#8211;NCS compound. The solid&#8208;state structure of GaF(L) was elucidated by X&#8208;ray diffraction and revealed an unconventional heptacoordination of Ga(III). A high radiochemical conversion (RCC) of 86&#8201;% was achieved at room temperature, in water at pH&#8197;5 within 20&#8197;minutes. Stability studies showed the robustness of the GaF(L) complex in aqueous media for at least one day and at least one hour for the radiolabeled analog Ga18F(L). These findings demonstrated that PC2A&#8208;based compounds are chelating agents of choice for (Ga18F) species, suggesting a real technological breakthrough for PET imaging and precision medicine.

         <title>Rational H2 Partial Pressure over Nickel/Ceria Crystal Enables Efficient and Durable Wide&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Zone Air&#8208;Level CO2 Methanation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 68, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigated the impact of H2/CO2 partial pressure ratios on CO2 methanation using Ni/CeO2. Results show elevated H2/CO2 ratios enhance CO2 conversion and CH4 selectivity, achieving complete methanation at 250&#8201;&#176;C and 100&#8201;% selectivity at 400&#8201;&#176;C. In&#8208;situ DRIFTS analysis indicates formate pathway dominance at higher ratios, key for CH4 production and CO2 mitigation strategies.







Abstract
On the way to carbon neutrality, directly catalyzing atmospheric CO2 into high&#8208;value chemicals might be an effective approach to mitigate the negative impacts of rising airborne CO2 concentrations. Here, we pioneer the investigation of the influence of the H2/CO2 partial pressure ratio (PPR) on air&#8208;level CO2 methanation. Using Ni/CeO2 as a case catalyst, increasing H2/CO2 PPR significantly improves low&#8208;temperature CO2 conversion and high&#8208;temperature CH4 selectivity, i.&#8201;e., from 10 of H2/CO2 PPR on, CO2 is completely methanized at 250&#8201;&#176;C, and nearly 100&#8201;% CH4 selectivity is achieved at 400&#8201;&#176;C. 100&#8208;hour stability tests demonstrate the practical application potential of Ni/CeO2 at 250&#8201;&#176;C and 400&#8201;&#176;C. In&#8208;situ DRIFTS reveal that reinforced formate pathway by increasing H2/CO2 PPR is responsible for the high CH4 yield. In contrast, even though the CO pathway dominated CO2 conversion on Ni is enhanced by rising H2/CO2 PPR, but at a high reaction temperature, the promoted CO desorption still leads to lower CH4 selectivity. This work offers deep insights into the direct air&#8208;level CO2 resourceization, contributing to the achievement of airborne CO2 reductions.

Results show elevated H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ratios enhance CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity, achieving complete methanation at 250&#8201;&#176;C and 100&#8201;% selectivity at 400&#8201;&#176;C. &lt;i&gt;In-situ&lt;/i&gt; DRIFTS analysis indicates formate pathway dominance at higher ratios, key for CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; production and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mitigation strategies.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way to carbon neutrality, directly catalyzing atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into high-value chemicals might be an effective approach to mitigate the negative impacts of rising airborne CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations. Here, we pioneer the investigation of the influence of the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; partial pressure ratio (PPR) on air-level CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; methanation. Using Ni/CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a case catalyst, increasing H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; PPR significantly improves low-temperature CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion and high-temperature CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity, i.&#8201;e., from 10 of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; PPR on, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is completely methanized at 250&#8201;&#176;C, and nearly 100&#8201;% CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity is achieved at 400&#8201;&#176;C. 100-hour stability tests demonstrate the practical application potential of Ni/CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at 250&#8201;&#176;C and 400&#8201;&#176;C. &lt;i&gt;In-situ&lt;/i&gt; DRIFTS reveal that reinforced formate pathway by increasing H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; PPR is responsible for the high CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; yield. In contrast, even though the CO pathway dominated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion on Ni is enhanced by rising H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; PPR, but at a high reaction temperature, the promoted CO desorption still leads to lower CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity. This work offers deep insights into the direct air-level CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; resourceization, contributing to the achievement of airborne CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reductions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoinduced Decarboxylative Thioacylation of N&#8208;Hydroxyphthalimide Esters with Tetraalkylthiuram Disulfides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 68, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced decarboxylation coupling reaction between N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters and tetraalkylthiuram disulfides was reported. This redox&#8208;neutral protocol uses inexpensive and readily available starting material under mild reaction conditions, exhibiting broad substrate scope and wide functional group compatibility. This method can be further used for post modification of complex natural products and bioactive drugs.







Abstract
Dithiocarbamate is a key structural sequence in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, and its synthesis is crucial in organic chemistry. Although significant progress has been made in related synthesis research, developing a practical and universal synthesis method remains fascinating. Herein, we report a new visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced decarboxylation coupling reaction between N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters and tetraalkylthiuram disulfides, which uses Ir(ppy)3 as a photocatalyst to promote the generation of corresponding decarboxylation thioacylation product&#8208;dithiocarbamates in high yields. This redox&#8208;neutral protocol uses inexpensive and readily available starting material under mild reaction conditions, exhibiting broad substrate scope and wide functional group compatibility. This method can be further used for post modification of complex natural products and bioactive drugs.

         <title>Structural and Electronic Factors Controlling the Efficiency and Rate of Intersystem Crossing to the Triplet State in Thiophene Polycyclic Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 68, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study establishes the electronic factors that control the intersystem crossing to the triplet state in six thiophene polycyclic derivatives in acetonitrile and cyclohexane solutions. It further underscores the significance of the C&#8722;S bond elongation coordinate and structural modifications on the nonradiative intersystem crossing to the triplet manifold in these thiophene polycyclic derivatives.







Abstract
Thiophene polycyclic derivatives are widely used in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, photovoltaics, and medicinal chemistry applications. Understanding the electronic and structural factors controlling their intersystem crossing rates is paramount for these applications to be successful. This study investigates the photophysical, electronic structure, and excited state dynamics of 1,2&#8208;benzodiphenylene sulfide, benzo[b]naphtho[1,2&#8208;d]thiophene, and benzo[b]naphtho[2,3&#8208;d]thiophene in polar aprotic and non&#8208;polar solvents. Steady&#8208;state absorption and emission spectroscopy, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, and DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations are employed. Low fluorescence quantum yields of 1.2 to 2.7&#8201;% are measured in acetonitrile and cyclohexene, evidencing that the primary relaxation pathways in these thiophene derivatives are nonradiative. Linear interpolation of internal coordinates calculations predict that an S&#8722;C bond elongation reaction coordinate facilitates the efficient intersystem crossing to the T1 state. Excitation of 1,2&#8208;benzodiphenylene sulfide and benzo[b]naphtho[1,2&#8208;d]thiophene at 350&#8197;nm or benzo[b]naphtho[2,3&#8208;d]thiophene at 365&#8197;nm, populates the lowest&#8208;energy 1&#960;&#960;* state, which relaxes to the 1&#960;&#960;* minimum in tens of picoseconds or intersystem crosses to the triplet manifold in ca. 500&#8197;ps to 1.1&#8197;ns depending on the position at which the benzene rings are added. Excitation at 266&#8197;nm does not affect the intersystem crossing rates. Laser photodegradation experiments demonstrate that the thiophene polycyclic derivatives are highly photostable.

         <title>Determining Ion&#8208;Pair Binding Affinities of Heteroditopic Receptor Systems</title>

         <dc:description>
Determining ion&#8208;pair affinities in heteroditopic receptor systems presents a persistent and significant challenge. Due to experimental and analytical complexity several expedient techniques to characterise ion&#8208;pair binding behaviour have been widely adopted. Here we experimentally interrogate these methods and reveal serious problems with their uncritical application and interpretation.







Abstract
Determining ion&#8208;pair affinities in heteroditopic receptor systems presents a persistent and significant challenge. The plethora of technical and experimental problems implicated in measuring ion&#8208;pair affinities have encouraged the use of several expedient experimental practices as a means of characterising ion&#8208;pair recognition behaviour. Exploiting a model heteroditopic receptor system, we interrogate the reliability of these methods and demonstrate that these commonly used techniques can be highly questionable and without extreme care can lead to incorrect conclusions.

         <title>The Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Continuum in the Salt/Cocrystal Systems of Quinoline and Chloro&#8208;Nitrobenzoic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 68, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen&#8208;bond continuum in six two&#8208;component solid systems is investigated using a complex experimental and computational methodology consisting of X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments with Hirshfeld atom&#8208;refinement, solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Path&#8208;integral molecular dynamics simulations incorporating nuclear quantum effects demonstrated significant hydrogen&#8208;atom delocalization and provided average N&#8722;H distances in excellent agreement with experimental results.







Abstract
This study investigates the hydrogen&#8208;bond geometry in six two&#8208;component solid systems composed of quinoline and chloro&#8208;nitrobenzoic acids. New X&#8208;ray diffraction studies were conducted using both the conventional independent&#8208;atom model and the more recent Hirshfeld atom&#8208;refinement method, with the latter providing precise hydrogen&#8208;atom positions. The systems can be divided into salts (the hydrogen atom transferred to the quinoline nitrogen), cocrystals (the hydrogen atom retained by the acid), and intermediate structures. Solid&#8208;state NMR experiments corroborated the X&#8208;ray diffraction&#8208;derived H&#8722;N distances. DFT calculations, using five functionals including hybrid B3LYP and PBE0, showed varying energy profiles for the hydrogen bonds, with notable differences across functionals. These calculations revealed different preferences for salt or cocrystal structures, depending on the functional used. Path&#8208;integral molecular dynamics simulations incorporating nuclear quantum effects demonstrated significant hydrogen&#8208;atom delocalization, forming a hydrogen&#8208;bond continuum, and provided average N&#8722;H distances in excellent agreement with experimental results. This comprehensive experimental and theoretical approach highlights the complexity of multicomponent solids. The study emphasizes that the classification into salts or cocrystals is frequently inadequate, as the hydrogen atom is often significantly delocalized in the hydrogen bond. This insight is crucial for understanding and predicting the behavior of such systems in pharmaceutical applications.

Using the predictable packing arrangement of guanidinium organosulfonate with a pyrene core a host of different small molecules can be encapsulated and their structures elucidated.







Abstract
Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) is the preferred and most accurate technique for determining molecular structures. However, it can present challenges when dealing with specific small molecules and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), as many do not form quality crystals without coformers or can be unstable. In this study, we introduce tetrakis(guanidinium) pyrenetetrasulfonate (G4PYR), a robust guanidinium&#8208;organosulfonate (GS) framework that efficiently encapsulates small molecules and APIs rich in functional groups. The hydrogen bonding frameworks formed by G4PYR display well&#8208;ordered structures with predictable pyrene&#8208;pyrene distances, making them ideally suited for targeting arene&#8208;based APIs with pendant groups. Successful encapsulation of various guests, including benzaldehyde, benzamide, and arenes containing multiple hydrogen bond donors and acceptors like uracil and thymine, was achieved. Furthermore, we successfully encapsulated important pharmaceutical and biologically relevant compounds, such as lidocaine, ropinirole, adenosine, thymidine, and others. Notably, we present a workflow for investigating host&#8208;guest complex formation using powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and high throughput experimentation.

         <title>Synthesis, Structures, and Properties for PIII&#8208;Doped Hetero&#8208;Buckybowls and Their Phosphonium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 68, December 5, 2024. </description>

Trivalent phosphorus (PIII) doped heterosumanenes (HSEs) and their phosphonium salts are synthesized. The valence states of P&#8208;dopants exert discernible effects on the molecular geometries, electronic structures, photophysical properties, and chemical reactivities of P&#8208;doped HSEs.







Abstract
Doping polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with heteroatoms enables manipulation of their electronic structures. Herein, the structures and properties of phosphorus (P) doped heterosumanenes (HSEs) are regulated by varying the valence states of P&#8208;dopant. The phosphine sulfide (PV) and chalcogens (S, Se, Te) co&#8208;doped HSEs (1&#8208;3) are reduced to trivalent phosphorus (PIII) doped analogues 4&#8211;6. Then, the PIII&#8208;dopants on 4&#8211;6 are converted to phosphonium salts (R4P+), giving 7&#8211;9. The valence states of P&#8208;dopant show great influence on molecular geometries and electronic structures. Taking P and S co&#8208;doped HSEs as example, bowl&#8208;depths increase in the order of 1 (PV)&lt;7 (R4P+)&lt;4 (PIII), and the HOMO energy levels and HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps increase to be 7&lt;1&lt;4. Consistent with the theoretical calculation, the first oxidation potentials decrease and the absorption/emission bands show blue shift from 7 to 1 to 4. The transformation of PV to PIII leads to large variations on the coordination with Ag+, owing to the alteration of coordination site from P=S to PIII. The phosphonium salts show ring&#8208;opening of phosphole rings under electrochemical reduction. It is found that chalcogen atoms play pivotal roles on coordination patterns of coordination complexes and the conversion rates of ring&#8208;opening reactions.

A bio&#8208;inspired [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase mimic immobilized in polyaniline nanotubes catalyzes hydrogen evolution at neutral pH under aerobic conditions, achieving enhanced activity with reduced overpotentials and increased current densities compared to the mimic alone.







Abstract
A bio&#8208;inspired FeFe hydrogenase model which catalyses hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic solutions is immobilized in polyaniline (PANI)&#8208;based nanotubes. A combination of analytical techniques reveals that this construct maintains both the molecular signatures of the bio&#8208;inspired complex and the material properties of PANI. The amine and imine&#8208;rich environment of the PANI chain amplifies the inherent HER activity of the bio&#8208;inspired complex, allowing electrocatalytic HER at neutral pH, with lower overpotentials and higher current densities compared to the bio&#8208;inspired complex alone. This construct retains the oxygen stability of the bio&#8208;inspired complex and remains stable through several hours of aerobic electrolysis, producing only 6.5&#8201;% H&#8322;O&#8322; from the competing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).

Synthetic model compounds illustrate the importance of the secondary sphere in tryptophan degrading heme dioxygenases, which are multifaceted drug targets against many challenging disease situations in humans, including cancer. Acidity&#8208;tuned Lewis acids were used to activate heme superoxide adducts, which mediate indole dioxygenation with the intermediacy of a key reaction precursor complex, resembling the ternary complex of enzyme systems.

A straightforward transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, one&#8208;pot electrochemical synthetic strategy toward high&#8208;value functionalized isoxazol(in)es is presented. The waste&#8208;reducing and cost&#8208;effective cascade transformation, involving &#8220;in&#8208;situ electrolyte&#8221; generation, comprises the condensation of aldehyde and NH2OH&#8901;HCl to an aldoxime followed by its anodic oxidation and subsequent [3+2] cycloadditions with a dipolarophile.

         <title>Cover Feature: Enhancing the Reactivity of an Aromatic cyclo&#8208;P5 Ligand via Electrophilic Activation (Chem. Eur. J. 68/2024)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 68, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrophilic activation of an iron&#8208;bound cyclo&#8208;P5 ligand overcomes its aromatic stabilization and enhances its reactivity towards nucleophiles. This mode of activation grants access to unprecedented reaction pathways for the cyclo&#8208;P5 moiety. Even weak nucleophiles, such as carbenes, N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins, imines and a base&#8208;stabilized phosphinidene can thus be used in its transformation to more complex polyphosphorus architectures. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Scheer and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202402675).

The synthesis of atomically precise porous/holey graphene materials, including PGs, pNGs, and pGNRs, have garnered significant attention for their exceptional properties in the last few decades. This mini review explores the recent advancements in the synthesis of porous/holey graphene materials through bottom&#8208;up approach, and their potential applications in several fields.







Abstract
Incorporation of regular order pores/holes/defects into semimetalic graphene sheets can tune the band gap up to 1&#8197;eV or more introducing semiconducting property and therefore exhibiting promising applications for organic electronics such as field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs), molecular sieve membranes, gas sensing, catalysis devices, etc. In this mini review, we focused on bottom&#8208;up approaches to introduce periodic homogeneous pores into graphene and nanographene and graphene nanoribbons along with their characteristics and potential applications in various fields.

         <title>A Superior Ionic Conducting Plastic Crystal Near Room Temperature with Electrical Bistability and Magnetic Transition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ion plastic crystal exhibits superionic conduction near room temperature, and the crystal&#8208;to&#8208;plastic crystal transformation results in bistability in both magnetic and electric properties.







Abstract
Multifunctional ionic plastic crystals (IPCs) are a class of unique materials that exhibit a wide range of advanced applications. In this work, we proposed a strategy for the design of multifunctional, superior ion&#8208;conducting IPCs with bistability in both magnetic and electric properties, moreover, we successfully prepared and thoroughly characterized such an IPC, [PMPyr][Ni(mnt)2] (1; PMPyr+=N&#8208;propyl&#8208;N&#8208;methylpyrrolidinium, and mnt2&#8722;=maleonitriledithiolate). Plastic crystal 1 exhibits superior ion conduction near room temperature, and its ion conductivity reaches the order of 10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 373&#8197;K. Remarkably, the crystal&#8208;to&#8208;plastic crystal transformation results in 1 simultaneously exhibiting electrical bistability and magnetic transition. Our study paves the way for the development of new IPCs with desirable functional properties.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework (MOF)&#8208;Based Sensors for Mercury (Hg) Detection: Design Strategies and Recent Progress</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work summarizes the advances of MOFs sensors for Hg and the main MOFs are UIO, ZIF, and MIL. Fluorescence and colorimetry are the two types of optical sensors for Hg. The recognition elements include T&#8208;rich aptamers, noble metal nanoparticles, central metal ions, and organic functional groups of MOFs. Portable devices like microfluidics and smartphones are developed to facilitate portability.







Abstract
Monitoring mercury (Hg) is critical for environmental and public health. Metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based sensors demonstrate the advantage of high sensitivity and rapid response. We summarize the advances of MOF sensors for Hg2+ detection from the perspective of MOF type and role in the sensors. First, we introduce three MOFs used in Hg sensors&#8208;UIO, ZIF, and MIL&#8208;that have demonstrated superior performance. Then, we discuss the specifics of MOF&#8208;based sensors for Hg2+ detection in terms of the recognition and signal elements. Currently, the recognition elements include T&#8208;rich aptamers, noble metal nanoparticles, central metal ions, and organic functional groups inherent to MOFs. Sensors with fluorescence and colorimetric signals are the two main types of optical MOF sensors used for Hg detection. Electrochemical sensors have also been fabricated, but these are less frequently reported, potentially due to the limited conductivity and cycling stability of MOFs. Notably, dual&#8208;signal sensors mitigate background signals interference and enhance the accuracy of Hg2+ detection. Furthermore, to facilitate portability and user&#8208;friendliness, portable devices such as microfluidics, paper&#8208;based devices, and smartphones have been developed for Hg2+ detection, showcasing potential applications. We also address the challenges related to MOF&#8208;based sensors for Hg2+ and future outlook.

Electrochemical sensors have also been fabricated, but these are less frequently reported, potentially due to the limited conductivity and cycling stability of MOFs. Notably, dual-signal sensors mitigate background signals interference and enhance the accuracy of Hg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; detection. Furthermore, to facilitate portability and user-friendliness, portable devices such as microfluidics, paper-based devices, and smartphones have been developed for Hg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; detection, showcasing potential applications. We also address the challenges related to MOF-based sensors for Hg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and future outlook.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Odorant Binding Proteins Facilitate the Gas&#8208;Phase Uptake of Odorants Through the Nasal Mucus</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conformational freedom. Porcine odorant binding protein mimics the gas phase environment of carvone by lowering the energy barrier of interconversion between different conformational states. A multi&#8208;scale computational approach reveals the driving force that allows OBPs to facilitate the transport of hydrophobic odorants through the hydrophilic mucus.







Abstract
Mammalian odorant binding proteins (OBPs) have long been suggested to transport hydrophobic odorant molecules through the aqueous environment of the nasal mucus. While the function of OBPs as odorant transporters is supported by their hydrophobic beta&#8208;barrel structure, no rationale has been provided on why and how these proteins facilitate the uptake of odorants from the gas phase. Here, a multi&#8208;scale computational approach validated through available high&#8208;resolution spectroscopy experiments reveals that the conformational space explored by carvone inside the binding cavity of porcine OBP (pOBP) is much closer to the gas than the aqueous phase, and that pOBP effectively manages to transport odorants by lowering the free energy barrier of odorant uptake. Understanding such perireceptor events is crucial to fully unravel the molecular processes underlying the olfactory sense and move towards the development of protein&#8208;based biomimetic sensor units that can serve as artificial noses.

         <title>Impact of Dihedral Angle in Conjugated Organic Cation on the Structures and Properties of Organic&#8208;Inorganic Lead Iodides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dihedral angle inside the organic cation significantly change the crystal packing as&#8208;well&#8208;as optical property of hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic metal halides (HOIMHs). We used N&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridinium cation (iodide counter&#8208;ion) for the synthesis of HOIMHs. The change in dihedral angle of the organic cation gives two different hybrid crystal with different optical property.







Abstract
Conjugated organic cations are intriguing for organic&#8208;inorganic halide perovskites due to their direct participation in the optoelectronic properties of hybrid materials. In conjugated cations, the dihedral angle, or torsion angle, between adjacent aromatic rings is a critical secondary structural element. This angle influences not only the shape of the cations but also the overlap between the &#960;&#8208;orbitals on adjacent rings, thereby affecting their electronic properties. Understanding how variations in the dihedral angle impact the structure and properties of hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic metal halides (HOIMHs) is fundamentally important. In this study, we utilized 2,2&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl bipyridinium as the organic cation, reacting it with PbI&#8322; to form hybrid lead iodides. Remarkably, variations in the dihedral angle between the two pyridinium rings resulted in the formation of two distinct crystal structures with different band gaps. Our findings demonstrate that manipulating the dihedral angle offers a novel approach to controlling the structures and properties of hybrid metal halides with conjugated cations.

         <title>Olikomycin A&#8211;A Novel Calcium&#8208;Dependent Lipopeptide with Antibiotic Activity Against Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Bacteria</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deletion of pleiotropic regulatory gene wblA in S. ghanaensis ATCC 14672 activated a novel biosynthetic gene cluster, producing Olikomycin A, a cyclic lipopeptide synthesized by non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases. In the presence of calcium, it shows promising activity against multidrug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, including methicillin&#8208; and vancomycin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus, inducing cell death by disrupting cell membrane integrity through a yet unknown mechanism.







Abstract
Research into new antibiotics is becoming increasingly important as antibiotic resistance increases worldwide. The genus Streptomyces in particular is able to produce a wide range of antimicrobial products due to the large number of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in its genome. However, not all BGCs are expressed under laboratory conditions. In this work, deletion of the gene wblA, encoding a global regulator of natural product biosynthesis and morphogenesis in Streptomyces, led to the production of a novel natural product, olikomycin A, in Streptomyces ghanaensis ATCC 14672. Complete structure elucidation revealed that olikomycin A belongs to a class of calcium&#8208;dependent antibiotics known as non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)&#8208;encoded acidic lipopeptides. These compounds exhibit remarkable antimicrobial activity in the presence of calcium. Insights into olikomycin A biosynthesis were provided by whole genome sequencing and gene inactivation studies, while bioactivity assays showed strong inhibition of the growth of multidrug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive pathogens via disrupting cell membrane integrity. Olikomycin A shows an antibiotic profile similar to that of daptomycin, which is already in clinical use.

         <title>Seeing Double: The Persistent Dimer&#8208;of&#8208;Dimers Structure of Drug Resistant Influenza A M2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
S31N M2 proton channel of influenza A virus, which is predominant in the circulating strains, persists in a dimer&#8208;of&#8208;dimers structure in different lipid environments regardless of lipid concentration. NMR spectra recorded with 55&#8197;kHz magic angle spinning show characteristic resonances confirming this conformation and indicate rotameric states of I32 and I39 side chains that are compatible with native helical backbone geometry.







Abstract
The currently circulating S31N variant of the M2 proton channel of influenza A is resistant to antiviral drugs. Recently, there has been a growing concern regarding the impact of the lipid environment on the structural features of the S31N variant. The native symmetry of the M2 tetramer remains controversial. Here we show that S31N M2 persists in a dimer&#8208;of&#8208;dimers structure in different lipid preparations independent of the amount of solvating lipids up to at least 180 lipids per tetramer. NMR spectra clearly detect the characteristic resonances of the dimer&#8208;of&#8208;dimers of M2 (residues 18&#8211;60 or 18&#8211;62) reconstituted in lipids. NMR&#8208;based distance measurements indicate that two isoleucine residues with upfield shifted alpha carbon resonances, typical of extended conformations, are compatible with a particular side&#8208;chain rotameric state and helical backbone geometry. These chemical shifts are therefore compatible with the expected native transmembrane helical fold. Symmetry breaking at the pH sensing H37 residues, detected via peak doubling, is a stable feature of S31N M2 based on the reference strain Udorn/1972(H3N2). By contrast, the spectrum is dramatically altered for Columbia/2014/(H3N2) M2, which differs in sequence in the amphipathic helices. This highlights an allosteric coupling between the amphipathic helices and the pH sensing residues.

         <title>Ag&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization&#8208;Intermolecular Sulfinyl Group Transfer Cascade Reactions Enabling Enantioselective Synthesis of 4&#8208;Sulfinylisoquinolines</title>

         <dc:description>
Cyclization &#8211; intermolecular sulfinyl group transfer reactions of N&#8208;sulfinylimines derived from ortho&#8208;alkynylbenzaldehydes were effectively promoted by &#960;&#8208;Lewis acidic Ag catalysts, affording the 4&#8208;sulfinylisoquinolines in good yields. Additionally, the Ag&#8208;catalyzed reactions in the presence of quinidine acetate as a chiral nucleophilic cocatalyst, yielded the chiral sulfoxides with high enantioselectivities.







Abstract
N&#8208;Sulfinylimines derived from ortho&#8208;alkynylbenzaldehydes were efficiently converted into the corresponding 4&#8208;sulfinylisoquinolines in good to excellent yields. The reaction proceeds via cyclization followed by intermolecular migration of the sulfinyl group from the nitrogen atom to the silver&#8208;bound carbon of the resulting cyclized vinylsilver intermediate with the aid of either a counteranion or a nucleophilic species. Moreover, the Ag&#8208;catalyzed reaction in the presence of quinidine acetate as a chiral nucleophilic cocatalyst yielded chiral isoquinolines with high enantioselectivities through a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DYKAT).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Sulfinylimines derived from &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-alkynylbenzaldehydes were efficiently converted into the corresponding 4-sulfinylisoquinolines in good to excellent yields. The reaction proceeds via cyclization followed by intermolecular migration of the sulfinyl group from the nitrogen atom to the silver-bound carbon of the resulting cyclized vinylsilver intermediate with the aid of either a counteranion or a nucleophilic species. Moreover, the Ag-catalyzed reaction in the presence of quinidine acetate as a chiral nucleophilic cocatalyst yielded chiral isoquinolines with high enantioselectivities through a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DYKAT).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supramolecular Chiral Assembly of Dendritic Amphiphiles in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances of supramolecular chiral assembly from dendritic amphiphiles in aqueous media are reviewed, from the points of dendritic topologic effects on confinement of the assembled morphologies and bio&#8208;related properties. Through cooperative and crowding effects, dendritic amphiphiles conduct intriguing assembles to form versatile morphologies and exhibit promising biofunctions.







Abstract
Dendritic amphiphiles are a promising class of topological blocks for self&#8208;assembly to construct chiral supramolecular aggregates in aqueous media. Their unique dendritic geometry, structure variability and multivalence can mediate the assemblies with versatile morphologies and functions. The bulky dendritic moieties also enable the appropriate association&#8208;repulsion balance to control supramolecular growth, and simultaneously shield the assemblies with enhanced stabilities. Moreover, the crowded packing of dendritic segments facilitates the efficient chirality transfer from molecular level to supramolecular level, to achieve chirality amplification or enhancement. Dendritic moieties also provide chances to stabilize the assemblies in aqueous media through shielding and cooperative effects. The dendritic assemblies can be intriguingly made responsive to external stimuli including temperature, light, solvents or guests to switch their nanostructures or supramolecular chirality. Various dendritic amphiphiles bearing peptide or aromatic motifs have been reported in supramolecular chiral assembly, and their functional applications investigated. This review summarizes the significant progresses with a particular focus on the dendritic structural effects on supramolecular chiral assembly and the stimuli&#8208;responsiveness in aqueous media.

         <title>Insight into the Simultaneous Super&#8208;Stable Mineralization of AsO43&#8722;, Cd2+ and Pb2+ Using MgFe&#8208;LDHs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simultaneous mineralization of AsO43&#8722;, Cd2+ and Pb2+ with efficiency of &gt;99.0% in 240 min in aqueous solution and of &gt;81.1% in 14 days in soil can be achieved by both MgFe&#8208;CO3 and MgFe&#8208;NO3, during which the released Mg2+ ions were demonstrated to be able to promote the emergence and growth of red bean seedlings.







Abstract
Multiple&#8208;heavy&#8208;metal contamination in soil, such as the simultaneous presence of AsO43&#8722;, Cd2+ and Pb2+, which can reduce crop yields and damage human health, is a serious issue to be addressed. Herein, the MgFe&#8208;LDHs (layered double hydroxides) intercalated with carbonate and nitrate (MgFe&#8208;CO3 and MgFe&#8208;NO3) were synthesized by Separate Nucleation and Aging Steps and ion&#8208;exchange method, respectively. The MgFe&#8208;CO3 demonstrated the maximum saturation adsorption capacity of 55.86, 543.48 and 1597.4&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 for single AsO43&#8722;, Cd2+ and Pb2+ in aqueous solution, while MgFe&#8208;NO3 exhibited 92.50, 387.59 and 869.56&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively. Kinetic and thermodynamic results for mineralization of single AsO43&#8722;, Cd2+ and Pb2+ fitted well with the pseudo&#8208;second&#8208;order kinetic model and Langmuir isotherm model, indicating the occurrence of chemisorption and monolayer adsorption for both MgFe&#8208;CO3 and MgFe&#8208;NO3. Furthermore, simultaneous mineralization of AsO43&#8722;, Cd2+ and Pb2+ with &gt;99.0&#8201;% efficiency in 240&#8197;min in aqueous solution and &gt;81.1&#8201;% efficiency in 14&#8197;days in soil can be achieved by both MgFe&#8208;CO3 and MgFe&#8208;NO3. Preliminary red bean seedlings cultivation experiments indicated that the released Mg2+ ions from MgFe&#8208;CO3 and MgFe&#8208;NO3 were capable to promote the emergence and growth of red bean seedlings. Detailed XRD and XPS results demonstrated that the AsO43&#8722; anions were adsorbed on the laminate of LDHs, whereas the Pb3(OH)2(CO3)2 was the mineralization product for both MgFe&#8208;CO3 and MgFe&#8208;NO3. In terms of Cd2+, CdCO3 was obtained as a mineralization product for MgFe&#8208;CO3, while CdCO3 and Cd(OH)2 can be detected due to the slow transformation of MgFe&#8208;NO3 to MgFe&#8208;CO3 in air.

         <title>Ligand Engineering Toward Robust Sodium Storage in Self&#8208;Supported Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ligand engineering was proposed to design metal&#8208;organic frameworks with large conjugated naphthalene&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxylic acid. The uniquely conjugated aromatic ligands endow the metal&#8208;organic frameworks with rich sites to accommodate Na+ ions, thus enabling a high reversible capacity for sodium storage. Such metal&#8208;organic frameworks exhibit a capacity of 330&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 with remarkable rate capability and cycling performance.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries capable of charging and discharging rapidly and durably are eagerly demanded to replace current lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, large Na+ ions need more space to accommodate them. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks are promising anode materials, and their structure and performance are governed by organic ligands. Herein, we report a ligand engineering to design metal&#8208;organic frameworks with large conjugated naphthalene&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxylic acid. Self&#8208;supported arrays of metal&#8208;organic frameworks reveal robust sodium storage when used as a binder&#8208;free anode. The uniquely long and conjugated aromatic ligands endow the metal&#8208;organic frameworks with rich sites to accommodate Na+ ions, thus enabling a high reversible capacity for sodium storage. As a result, such metal&#8208;organic frameworks exhibit a high capacity of 330&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 with remarkable rate capability and cycling performance. This work provides an exciting ligand strategy to design high&#8208;capacity metal&#8208;organic framework materials and would find extensive applications in various energy storage systems.

         <title>Tandem Electroreduction of CO2 to C2+ Products based on M&#8208;SACs/Cu Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR) is considered a highly promising method to produce high&#8208;value chemicals and fuels, contributing significantly the artificial carbon balance. Cu species exhibit a distinct role in the formation of C2+ products characterized by enhanced energy density. The limited selectivity of C2+ products, along with the inferior stability, and high overpotential demonstrated by single&#8208;component Cu catalysts, hinders their applicability in industrial&#8208;scale production. The implementation of a tandem strategy, which involves coupling the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO pathway using metal single&#8208;atom catalysts (M&#8208;SACs), etc., with the CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion on Cu species, represents a novel approach for the efficient generation of C2+ products. Given the high cost and restricted availability of noble metals, M&#8208;SACs have attracted substantial interest in tandem systems. The systematic analysis of the design principles and  structure&#8208;activity relationship is essential for the advancement of M&#8208;SACs/Cu&#8208;based tandem catalysts. Here we first introduce various prevalent design strategies of M&#8208;SACs/Cu&#8208;based tandem catalysts for ECO2RR and then systematically summarize the latest advancements of M&#8208;SACs/Cu&#8208;based tandem system, encompassing metal&#8208;organic frameworks/Cu (MOFs/Cu), covalent organic frameworks/Cu (COFs/Cu), and nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon support transition metal single atomic materials/Cu (M&#8208;N&#8208;C/Cu). Lastly, we discuss the challenges and opportunities with the design and construction of M&#8208;SACs/Cu&#8208;based tandem catalysis for ECO2RR.</dc:description>

         <title>Mushroom&#8208;Mediated Redox Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The application of biocatalysts in organic synthesis has grown significantly in recent years, and both academia and industry are continuously searching for novel biocatalysts capable of performing challenging chemical reactions. Mushroom is a rich source of ligninolytic and secondary metabolite biosynthetic enzymes, and therefore was consider as promising biocatalysts for organic synthesis. This review focused on the broad utilization potential of the mushroom&#8208;based biocatalysts and highlights key advances in mushroom&#8208;mediated organic transformations. It mainly includes reduction of ketone and carboxylic acids, hydroxylation of aromatic and aliphatic compounds, epoxidation of olefin, oxidative cleavage of alkene, and other uncommon reactions catalyzed by the whole&#8208;cells or purified enzymes of mushroom&#8208;origin. Overall, a comprehensive overview of the applications of mushroom as biocatalyst in organic synthesis is provided, which puts this versatile microorganism in the spotlight of further research.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of An Unsymmetrical Dialumane and Kinetic Analysis of Its Alkene Insertion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An unsymmetrical dialumane was synthesized by the reaction of a nucleophilic alumanyl anion with a bromoalumane and it was structurally characterized to show the existence of the Et2O&#8208;coordination to the Al atom. The reactivity of the obtained Al&#8211;Al bond toward ethylene and styrene was examined, and the resulting insertion products underwent subsequent reactions. The reaction of the dialumane with styrene was decelerated by an addition of Et2O, suggesting that an Et2O dissociation occurred before the alkene insertion, which can be distinguished from an associative mechanism involving a five&#8208;coordinated Al intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>pH Controlled transient cyclization of peptides for increased stability towards oral delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptides are highly efficient for treatment of many diseases, especially in oncology and diabetes. Oral delivery of peptides is desirable, but is challenged by low bioavailability and new chemical methods to enable oral delivery are needed. Here, we developed pH responsive linearization as a strategy for transient protection of peptides to extend their half&#8208;life in model systems. Peptides were cyclized to increase their stability at the low pH in the stomach, while they linearize at neutral pH to form the active peptide. We developed ester based responsive linkers with a protonable amine for O&#8208;to&#8208;N acyl shift, which allowed linearization strategies based on pyroglutamoyl (pGlu) or diketopiperazine (DKP) formation. After coupling of the linker, peptides were cyclized by CuAAC. We studied the stability against simulated gastric fluid (SGF) at different pH and the ability of cyclic peptides to linearize. This led to PYY3&#8208;36 analogues with pH responsive linearization for increased stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Thiazolidinedione&#8208; and Triazole&#8208;Linked Organoselenocyanates and Evaluation of Anticancer Activities Against Breast Cancer with Mechanistic Investigations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organoselenocyanates are important classes of organoselenium compounds having potential pharmaceutical applications in cancer biology. In the present study, two different series of organoselenocyanates (15a&#8208;15c and 16a&#8208;16c) incorporating crucial heterocyclic pharmacophores such as 2,4&#8208;thiazolidine&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione and 1,2,3&#8208;triazole were rationally designed. The organoselenocyanates were synthesized using multi&#8208;step organic synthesis and investigated for their anticancer activities against triple&#8208;negative breast cancer cells. Based on the preliminary anti&#8208;proliferative activities and the selectivity index towards cancer cells over the normal cells, 2,4&#8208;thiazolidine&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione&#8208;based selenocyanate 15a was identified as the lead analogue for detailed investigations. In addition to the anti&#8208;migratory activity, compound 15a induced G1&#8208;phase arrest of the cell cycle and led to early apoptosis. Further studies on the redox balance of MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells indicated the antioxidant nature of 15a with the quenching of ROS level and upregulation of TrxR1 expression. Detailed mechanistic investigations with the expression levels of key&#8208;cancer marker proteins revealed that the selenocyanate 15a induced the activation of ERK pathway by upregulating p&#8208;ERK expression with the subsequent downregulation of p&#8208;Akt and c&#8208;Myc levels leading to the inhibition of cellular proliferation. Therefore, the primary outcomes of the study would be valuable in the development of chemotherapeutic agents towards the treatment of triple&#8208;negative breast cancer.</dc:description>

In addition to the anti-migratory activity, compound 15a induced G1-phase arrest of the cell cycle and led to early apoptosis. Further studies on the redox balance of MDA-MB-231 cells indicated the antioxidant nature of 15a with the quenching of ROS level and upregulation of TrxR1 expression. Detailed mechanistic investigations with the expression levels of key-cancer marker proteins revealed that the selenocyanate 15a induced the activation of ERK pathway by upregulating p-ERK expression with the subsequent downregulation of p-Akt and c-Myc levels leading to the inhibition of cellular proliferation.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A facile, green, and economical method for the scalable synthesis of hydrophilic copper&#8208;triazole metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Cu&#8208;trz) is demonstrated. Numerous open metal sites within the highly crystalline porous structure of Cu&#8208;trz are generated through mild thermal activation, enabling its application in liquid&#8208;phase ethanol dehydration under ambient conditions. The frameworks with distinct crystallinity and particle sizes were achieved by modifying the synthesis process. The high crystallinity of the framework plays an exclusive role in enhancing water adsorption capacity. With selective water adsorption comparable to commercial zeolite 3A, Cu&#8208;trz MOF emerges as a promising candidate for cost&#8208;effective water&#8208;ethanol separation.</dc:description>

         <title>A Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Responsive Fluorescent Diarylethene Having a Betaine Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introduction of a pyridinium N&#8208;enolate betaine structure to photochromic diarylethene leads to significant red shifts of absorption spectra in both open&#8208;ring and closed&#8208;ring forms and provides the molecule with fluorescing ability. The diarylethene undergoes efficient turn&#8208;off mode switching of fluorescence upon photocyclization induced by 405&#8197;nm light in solution and polymer films.







Abstract
As a new molecular scaffold of photoswitchable fluorophore, we developed a photochromic diarylethene containing a betaine structure based on pyridinium N&#8208;enolate. A facile reaction of a pyridyl&#8208;substituted dithienylperfluorocyclopentene derivative with octafluorocyclopentene constructed the betaine structure. The introduction of the betaine moiety provided the diarylethene molecule with bathochromically shifted optical absorption and fluorescing ability, thus enabling the molecule to function as a visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive turn&#8208;off mode photoswitchable fluorophore. The molecule in the open&#8208;ring form emitted bright bluish green fluorescence. Upon irradiation with 405&#8197;nm light, the molecule underwent cyclization isomerization to form the closed&#8208;ring isomer and the fluorescence intensity significantly decreased. The turn&#8208;off mode fluorescence photoswitching was observed not only in solution but also in polymer films.

         <title>Copper(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective H/D Exchange Based on Reversible C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for Cu&#8208;catalyzed H/D exchange was developed based on the mechanistic framework of reversible concerted metalation&#8208;deprotonation. This process, which typically follows disproportionation of Cu(II) to Cu(III) in the functionalizations, was hindered by the presence of picolinic acid. This inhibition enabled the inverse reconstruction of C&#8722;D bond using heavy water as deuterium source, with a catalytic loading of copper species.







Abstract
Despite the increasing use of copper in C&#8722;H functionalizations, the Cu&#8208;catalyzed direct deuteration of C&#8722;H bonds remains a significant challenge due to its inherent low reactivity in inverse C&#8722;H bond reconstruction. In this paper, a novel strategy had been developed to reverse the copper&#8208;catalyzed concerted metalation&#8208;deprotonation process by inhibiting the unexpected disproportionation of Cu(II) to Cu(III). Picolinic acid was identified as a powerful ligand for facilitating this H/D exchange with D2O as deuterium source, and its inhibition activity was supported by preliminary control experiments and DFT studies.

     alt="Copper(II)-Catalyzed Regioselective H/D Exchange Based on Reversible C&#8722;H Activation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strategy for Cu-catalyzed H/D exchange was developed based on the mechanistic framework of reversible concerted metalation-deprotonation. This process, which typically follows disproportionation of Cu(II) to Cu(III) in the functionalizations, was hindered by the presence of picolinic acid. This inhibition enabled the inverse reconstruction of C&#8722;D bond using heavy water as deuterium source, with a catalytic loading of copper species.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Experimental and Computational Studies of Steric Factors in the Isomerization of Internal Alkynes within the Coordination Environment of Half&#8208;Sandwich Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal&#8208;supported vinylidene rearrangement of internal alkynes bearing sterically demanding anthracene, durene, and ferrocene substituents was examined. The various steps in the reaction pathway include metal&#8208;fragment activation via chloride abstraction, substrate coordination, and transition&#8208;state analyses were identified and analyzed via DFT level calculations. When coordination of the alkyne is overly restricted by the substrate substituents, the reaction pathway switches to form &#951;6&#8208;coordinated sandwich compounds.







Abstract
The isomerization of internal alkynes Ar1C&#8801;CAr2 within the coordination environment of low&#8208;valent half&#8208;sandwich [Ru(dppe)Cp]+ complexes via a 1,2&#8208;migration process affords vinylidene species [Ru{=C=C(Ar1)Ar2}(dppe)Cp]+. The rearrangement reactions of symmetrically and asymmetrically substituted substrates featuring different electron&#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing groups and of varying steric bulk were modelled using density functional theory (DFT), and the conclusions supported by experimental observations. Examination of the reaction pathway and associated activation barriers reveal a high solvent dependency for the generation of the key intermediate species [Ru(dppe)Cp]+ from [RuCl(dppe)Cp] by halide dissociation in the presence of Na+ salts of weakly coordinating anions, with the lattice enthalpy of the NaCl by&#8208;product playing a critical role in the overall thermochemical balance of the reaction. The activation barriers associated with the reaction of [Ru(dppe)Cp]+ with Ar1C&#8801;CAr2, and the relative energies of the alkyne complexes [Ru(&#951;2&#8208;Ar1C&#8801;CAr2)(dppe)Cp]+, are sensitive to the electron density of the alkyne and conformational changes associated with the &#8216;bend&#8208;back&#8217; of the substrate. The latter differs by up to 66.1&#8197;kJ/mol, which in turn impacts the barrier height of the subsequent 1,2&#8208;migration step involved in the rearrangement process and ultimately the overall thermochemical nature of the complete reaction. The relative importance of these factors is evinced by the successful rearrangement of the very sterically congested 1(9&#8208;anthryl)&#8208;2(9&#8208;phenanthryl) acetylene into the fully characterized diaryl vinylidene complex, which was isolated in 89&#8201;% yield.

Paving the way for interface&#8208;enhanced catalysis at the gas&#8211;liquid interface, the platinum bis&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complex with polyethylene glycol and alkyl side chains trans&#8208;[Pt(mPEG3C8Im)2Cl2] is presented. Angle&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals pronounced interface accumulation of this complex in solutions of (mPEGn)&#8208;substituted, imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquids. Solution NMR experiments unveil that two isomers, trans&#8208;syn and trans&#8208;anti, exist in a temperature&#8208;dependent equilibrium.







Abstract
We present the preparation and investigation of a fluorine&#8208;free surface&#8208;active bis&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) platinum(II) complex &#8212; trans&#8208;[Pt(mPEG3C8Im)2Cl2] &#8212; for interface&#8208;enhanced supported ionic liquid phase (SILP) catalysis within a group of (mPEGn)&#8208;substituted ionic liquids (ILs) ([(mPEGn)2Im][A] ILs). The complex was characterized by means of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (scXRD) analysis and multinuclear (1H, 13C, 195Pt) NMR spectroscopy, indicating the presence of two almost equimolar syn&#8211;anti&#8208;rotamers of the square&#8208;planar complex in solution. Angle&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ARXPS) revealed pronounced interface&#8208;accumulation of trans&#8208;[Pt(mPEG3C8Im)2Cl2] in IL solutions of [(mPEG2)2Im][A] (A&#8722;=I&#8722; and PF6&#8722;).

         <dc:description>
The first general synthesis of &#947;&#8208;tribromo and &#947;&#8208;trichloromethylated enals was achieved under mild organophotoredox catalyzed conditions with perfect regioselectivity. Importantly, a one&#8208;pot protocol was also reported to furnish the corresponding &#947;&#8208; dihalomethylidenated adducts.







Abstract
We report a general remote tribromo&#8208; and trichloromethylation process using CBr4 and CBrCl3 as ready available sources of trihalomethyl radicals. This method operates under mild and metal&#8208;free photocatalyzed conditions and enables the access to &#947;&#8208;trihalomethylated enals with complete regioselectivity in up to 71&#8201;% isolated yield. Importantly, this protocol is easily adapted to the selective one&#8208;pot synthesis of the corresponding &#947;&#8208;dihalomethylidenated enals in up to 49&#8201;% overall yield. Mechanistic studies are in favor of a radical chain propagation initiated by an oxidative quenching of the photocatalyst.

         <title>Frustrated Lewis Pairs from Al&#8722;E{14} Bonds (E{14}=Ge, Sn, Pb)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) with Al and E{14} (E{14}=Ge, Sn, Pb) centres is described. Analysis of unsupported Al&#8722;E{14} bonds show a Lewis basic (LB) Al and a Lewis acidic (LA) E{14}, with appreciable E{14}&#8594;Al back donation. Reaction with ethene forms the ethylene bridged FLP with segregated the LA (Al) and LB (Ge/Sn) centres. The Al/Ge FLP reacts with CO2 carbodiimide to afford activation and insertion products, respectively.







Abstract
The potassium aluminyl K[Al(NON)] ([NON]2&#8722;=[O(SiMe2NDipp)2]2&#8722;, Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) reacts with group 14 chloroamidinates E{14}(Am)Cl (E{14}=Ge, Sn, Pb. [Am]&#8722;=[tBuC(NDipp)2]&#8722;) to form (NON)Al&#8722;E{14}(Am) Lewis pairs with unsupported Al&#8722;E{14} bonds, including the first structurally authenticated Al&#8722;Pb bond. Analysis using spectroscopic (NMR, UV&#8208;vis and M&#246;ssbauer for E{14}=Sn), X&#8208;ray diffraction and computational (DFT, QTAIM, TD&#8208;DFT) methods conclude an Al&#8722;E{14} &#963;&#8208;bond derived from a Lewis basic Al and a Lewis acidic tetrylene, with back&#8208;donation from the E{14} s&#8208;orbital lone pair donor NBO to acceptor NBOs on Al that are derived from s/p&#8208;orbitals. The reaction of the Al&#8722;Ge compound with CO2 forms the dioxocarbene (NON)Al(&#956;&#8208;O2C)Ge(Am), whilst under the same conditions the Al&#8722;Sn compound reacts with additional CO2 to form the carbonate, (NON)Al(&#956;&#8208;CO3)Sn(Am). Addition of ethene to the Al&#8722;E{14} (E{14}=Ge, Sn) compounds introduces an ethylene bridge between the aluminium and group 14 atoms forming a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP). Reaction of the (Al/Ge) FLP with CO2 forms an activation product with new Al&#8722;O and Ge&#8722;C bonds, whilst reaction with iPrN=C=NiPr proceeds with insertion into the Al&#8722;C bond to form an aluminium amidinate.

         <title>H&#169;Li4Au4&#8722;: Planar Tetracoordinate Hydrogen in an Electrostatic Interaction Dominated Superhalogen Anion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The star D4h H&#169;Li4Au4&#8722; superhalogen anion with a planar tetracoordinate hydrogen (ptH) center was designed. The electrostatic interactions dominate the stability of the ptH, while the contribution of multicenter covalent bonds is limited.







Abstract
Planar hypercoordination has intrigued researchers for decades, yet hydrogen remained absent from this category until recently. Despite some advancements, further exploration of the emerging field of planar hypercoordinate hydrogen chemistry is still necessary. Herein, we report a D4h symmetric H&#169;Li4Au4&#8722; cluster containing a planar tetracoordinate hydrogen (ptH) center. Both density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio calculations revealed that designed H&#169;Li4Au4&#8722; is a real global minimum. Meanwhile, it also possesses excellent dynamic stability. This stability is dominated by electrostatic interactions, and reinforced by multicenter covalent bonds rather than any aromaticity. Interestingly, it is the first superhalogen anion in the ptH cluster and is expected to experimental synthesis and characterization.

         <title>Chirality&#8208;Dependent Anisotropic Nonlinear Optical Effect in Low&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Metal Halides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Concept Article highlights recent advances in chiral low&#8208;dimensional hybrid halides (LDHMHs), with a focus on the chiral nonlinear optical effects. Chiral LDHMHs show a remarkable ability to efficiently discriminate and generate circularly polarized light, making them outstanding candidates for future applications in optical information processing, optical encryption, and chiral sensing.







Abstract
Low&#8208;dimensional hybrid metal halides (LDHMHs) have emerged as a highly promising class of functional materials for a wide range of optoelectronic applications. Their exceptional structural tunability, facilitated by the hybridization of metal halides with organic compounds, enables the formation of three&#8208;, two&#8208;, one&#8208;, or zero&#8208;dimensional structures. This flexibility in structural design also allows the incorporation of chirality into the crystalline lattice, giving rise to novel LDHMH materials that are capable of selectively interacting with the spin angular momentum of electrons and photons. Among the unique optoelectronic properties of LDHMHs, the focus of this concept article is their chiroptical nonlinear optical (NLO) effect. LDHMHs demonstrate a highly effective discrimination and generation of circularly polarized (CP) light in the NLO regime, particularly in the second harmonic generation (SHG) process, referred to as SHG&#8208;circular dichroism (SHG&#8208;CD) and CP&#8208;SHG. These anisotropic responses are several orders of magnitude larger than linear chiroptical responses, such as CD and CP luminescence; consequently, LDHMHs are expected to be promising candidates for future optical&#8208;information devices and encryption systems. This article introduces recently reported chiral LDHMH materials that exhibit excellent CP&#8208;dependent anisotropic SHG responses.

         <title>NIR Diradical&#8208;Featured Croconaine Nanoagent for Cancer Photoacoustic Imaging and Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable diradical&#8208;featured croconaine CR845 showed a NIR absorption at 845&#8197;nm (&#1013;=3.37&#215;105&#8197;L&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and a relatively high photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of 58.8&#8201;%. CR845 nanoparticles showed good photostability, good biocompatibility, favorable NIR photoacoustic potential, effective cancer cell killing and complete tumor elimination upon 850&#8197;nm laser irradiation.







Abstract
Radical&#8208;featured organic materials usually demonstrate significantly narrower bandgap than that of regular organic materials, which is beneficial for near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption and non&#8208;radiative decay process, making them good candidates for photothermal agents (PTAs) of photothermal therapy (PTT). However, most organic radicals are too short&#8208;lived to be separated and stable. Herein, a stable pyrylium&#8208;croconaine (CR) dye CR845 with high diradical character was synthesized and assembled into CR845 nanoparticles (NPs) to explore the photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and photothermal therapeutic performance under NIR irradiation in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. CR845 exhibited a stable NIR absorption at 845&#8197;nm (&#1013;=3.37&#215;105&#8197;L&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and a relatively high photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of 58.8&#8201;%. When assembled into nanoparticles, CR845 NPs showed good photostability, good biocompatibility, favorable NIR photoacoustic potential, effective cancer cell killing and complete tumor elimination upon 850&#8197;nm laser irradiation. The work demonstrates a diradical&#8208;featured CR PTA with favorable PAI/PTT effects, which can help to provide new ideas for the development of NIR PTAs, and further promote the application of organic radical materials in the field of biomedicine.

         <title>Confinement Effects of Coordination Cages on the Synthesis and Application of Polyoxometalates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept article explores the advancements and challenges in utilizing coordination cages and their confinement effects to further the development of polyoxometalates (POMs). It reviews supramolecular approaches through examples of host&#8208;guest encapsulation and cavity&#8208;directed synthesis, highlights their applications, and presents future perspectives for the field.







Abstract
The confinement effects within coordination cages present powerful tools in modern chemistry, particularly for the synthesis and manipulation of complex molecules. This concept article reviews the use of coordination cages to stabilize and tune the properties of polyoxometalates (POMs), a class of nano&#8208;sized metallic clusters, expanding the focus beyond traditional organic reactions. The article provides a brief overview of coordination cages, POM chemistry and discusses the encapsulation of POMs in coordination cages, highlighting how these cages provide a confinement effect that enhances the stability and reactivity of POMs. Additionally, the concept of cavity&#8208;directed synthesis is explored as a method for creating labile POMs, which are often unstable in aqueous conditions, underlining its implications for supramolecular catalysis. Future research will focus on expanding the structures and applications of encapsulated POMs, as well as improving cage designs to unlock new cluster architectures.

&lt;p&gt;This concept article explores the advancements and challenges in utilizing coordination cages and their confinement effects to further the development of polyoxometalates (POMs). It reviews supramolecular approaches through examples of host-guest encapsulation and cavity-directed synthesis, highlights their applications, and presents future perspectives for the field.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The confinement effects within coordination cages present powerful tools in modern chemistry, particularly for the synthesis and manipulation of complex molecules. This concept article reviews the use of coordination cages to stabilize and tune the properties of polyoxometalates (POMs), a class of nano-sized metallic clusters, expanding the focus beyond traditional organic reactions. The article provides a brief overview of coordination cages, POM chemistry and discusses the encapsulation of POMs in coordination cages, highlighting how these cages provide a confinement effect that enhances the stability and reactivity of POMs. Additionally, the concept of cavity-directed synthesis is explored as a method for creating labile POMs, which are often unstable in aqueous conditions, underlining its implications for supramolecular catalysis. Future research will focus on expanding the structures and applications of encapsulated POMs, as well as improving cage designs to unlock new cluster architectures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Neutral Interface Directed 3D Confined Self&#8208;Assembly of Block Copolymer: Anisotropic Patterned Particles with Ordered Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neutral interface directed 3D confined self&#8208;assembly (3D&#8208;CSA) of block copolymer represents a robust strategy for the production of polymer particles featuring ordered nanostructures and various shapes, particularly those with anisotropic characteristics. This review elucidates the fundamental law governing shape control, the methodologies for constructing neutral interfaces, as well as the diverse properties and potential applications of anisotropic patterned particles.







Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional confined self&#8208;assembly (3D&#8208;CSA) of block copolymers (BCPs) is a distinctive and robust strategy that can yield colloidal polymer particles boasting ordered internal structures and diverse morphologies. The unique advantage of neutral interface lies in its ability to create anisotropic particles with surface patterns. The resulting unique polymer particles exhibit deformability under swelling, coupled with excellent spreadability and optical properties. These particles can also be used for fabrication of anisotropic nanoobjects or mesoporous particles via disassembly or serving as templates. This review comprehensively outlines the research advancements in neutral interface&#8208;guided 3D&#8208;CSA systems, including surfactant engineering, internal structure control, properties and future possibilities of anisotropic patterned particles.

         <title>Reusable Iron&#8208;Copper Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Primary Amides with Aryl and Alkyl Halides: Access to N&#8208;Arylamides as Potential Antibacterial and Anticancer Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present, for the first time, an efficient ligand&#8208;free iron&#8208;copper catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction involving a variety of aryl, heteroaryl halides (including chlorides, bromides, and iodides), and alkyl bromides with diverse aryl and aliphatic primary amides, conducted under solvent&#8208;minimized conditions. This economically competitive protocol successfully yielded the corresponding cross&#8208;coupling products, N&#8208;arylamides and N&#8208;alkylamides, in good to excellent yields with broad substrate scope (65 examples) and tolerance to several sensitive functionalities (including heterocycles). No conventional work&#8208;up is required for this protocol, and the developed method is applicable for gram&#8208;scale synthesis. Notably, the catalyst is inexpensive, environmentally friendly, and can be reused at least four times with minimal loss of catalytic activity. A series of experiments, including X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry (CV), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) were conducted to identify the oxidation state of active catalytic species and radical clock experiment was performed using a radical probe to investigate the reaction mechanism. Furthermore, we evaluated the antibacterial and anticancer properties of selected synthesized products (3ii, 3xii, and 3xxxx) in&#8208;vitro. The results indicated that the prepared compounds exhibited promising antibacterial and anticancer activities (MTT and Molecular Docking).</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report a "carbonylative migration" strategy for the acylation&#8208;esterification type double functionalization of unactivated alkenes using alkyloxalkyl chlorides and CO as the reagents. The transformation is proceeded by the alkoxycarbonyl radical addition to unactivated alkenes, followed by the insertion of carbon monoxide to induce intramolecular migration of heteroaryl groups, which is different from the traditional reaction modes. The reaction conditions were mild and well tolerated with varieties of functional groups. A variety of 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds with different ester groups were produced easily which has high potential applications in biology, medicine, and other fields.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, we simultaneously synthesized three different double B&#8592;N Lewis pair&#8208;functionalized naphthalenes including the asymmetric BNNY and BNNO and the mirror&#8208;symmetric BNNR, via a one&#8208;pot method. The annulation modes of the B&#8592;N Lewis pairs and the substituents on the boron atoms efficiently tune the molecular frontier orbitals and emission colors. &#945;&#8208;Position fusion leads to a significant enhancement of the HOMO energy level and a decrease in the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap, while the electron&#8208;withdrawing groups attached to the boron atom make the LUMO energy level more stable. In particular, the LUMO energy level of BNNO is as low as &#8208;3.12 eV. BNNY, BNNO, and BNNR emit cyan, green, and red fluorescence at 509, 534, and 620 nm, respectively, with fluorescence quantum yields of 24%, 49%, and 30%, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>A {Cr4Ln2} Complex with Exchange Coupled {Cr2} Units: Structural Description and Magnetic Study.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have prepared and structurally characterized pivalate based {CrIII4LnIII2} complexes with Ln=Dy and Gd as well as the Y analogue, with the overall formula  [CrIII4LnIII2(mdea)2(piv)10(OH)4], Ln= Gd, Dy and Y. We are reporting a detailed experimental magnetic properties study, including magnetization relaxation dynamics and calorimetric data, supported with quantum chemical calculations.  The synthesis of the Y derivative, allowed to precisely identify the Cr(III)&#8208;Cr(III) exchange interaction magnitude which proved moderately strong and in agreement with known magneto&#8208;structural correlations. &#160;This result agrees with the observed double bridged {Cr2&#8208;mOH&#8208;mOR} units within the {Cr4Ln2} complexes.The Gd(III) complex magnetic properties can be properly described with the already established exchange coupled {Cr2} units, and a unique Gd(III)&#8208;Cr(III) exchange coupling parameter which proved anti&#8208;ferromagnetic in nature.The MCE characterization of this complexbased on magnetization and calorimetric data down to 2 K affords a moderate entropy change value, mainly affected by the strong Cr&#8208;Cr exchange interaction.The complex with Ln=Dy, showed SMM behaviour below 10 K under 0 DC applied field with negligible field dependence up to 3000 Oe and 10 kHz of AC field frequency. Two relaxation processes are clearly distinguished, with thermal barriers for an Orbach mechanism of ca. 20 cm&#8208;1 and 40 cm&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantiopure Macrocycles Based on Tr&#246;ger's Base and Diphenyl Maleimide Exhibiting Strong Chiral Emission and Host&#8208;guest Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While a plenty of macrocyclic hosts have been developed in supramolecular chemistry, those that combine chiral luminescent properties and host&#8208;guest recognition abilities are still uncommon. Herein, two pairs of enantiomeric macrocycles were synthesized via Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura [2+2] cyclization reactions using Tr&#246;ger's base and diphenyl maleimide as the building blocks. The diphenyl maleimide units impart these macrocycles with highly strong fluorescence, achieving quantum yields up to 100% in apolar solvents. Furthermore, the chiral, V&#8208;shaped Tr&#246;ger's base units provide the macrocycles with circularly polarized luminescence (|glum| = 1.68 &#215; 10&#8722;3) and well&#8208;define cavity for hosting electron&#8208;deficient or positively charged guests with Ka up to 1.7 &#215; 106 M&#8722;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitride Zeolites from Ammonothermal Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxide zeolites are synthesized from aqueous solutions in an established way employing hydrothermal synthesis. Transferring this approach to nitride zeolites requires a solvent providing nitrogen for which ammonia has proven to be particularly suitable. We present the successful ammonothermal synthesis of the (oxo)nitridosilicate compounds Ce3[Si6N11], Li2RE4[Si4N8]O3 (RE = La, Ce) and K1.25Ce7.75[Si11N21O2]O0.75. Within this procedure, the usage of supercritical ammonia as a solvent as well as the utilization of the mineralizers NaN3, Li3N and KN3, respectively, allowed the targeted synthesis of large single crystals. Formation of these (oxo)nitridosilicates depend mainly on the employed mineralizer despite their similar degree of condensation. The three compounds were structurally characterized using X&#8208;ray diffraction and their crystal structures contain a wide range of different ring sizes within their tetrahedra networks. The zeolite(&#8208;like) crystal structures are elucidated and compared to known nitridosilicate representatives of the respective structure types. Their elemental composition was investigated using energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray (EDX) spectroscopy and incorporation of the O rather than N&#8722;H functionality was confirmed by Fourier&#8208;Transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy as well as by charge distribution (CHARDI) and bond valence sum (BVS) calculations. The presented examples demonstrate that ammonothermal synthesis provides a one&#8208;step access from elemental starting materials towards nitride zeolites.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanohybrids of 2D Black Phosphorus with Phthalocyanines: Role of Interfacial Interactions in Heterostructure Development</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New 2D black phosphorus (bP)&#8211;phthalocyanine (Pc) nanohybrids have been synthesized by liquid phase exfoliation of black phosphorus crystals in the presence of two organic dyes: phthalocyanine (Pc) and manganese phthalocyanine (MnPc). The key role of the metal cation in the interfacial interaction between the organic dye and bP nanosheets was demonstrated by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and associated with an electron transfer between the metal cation Mn2+ and bP nanosheets, which resembles a coordinative chemical bond. On the other hand, the interaction between bP nanosheets and pure phthalocyanine is governed by van der Waals forces. The fluorescence of both hybrids is significantly reduced indicating effective separation of the photoinduced charge, implying the formation of a heterojunction between the organic molecules and the bP nanosheets. These findings provide important insights into the interfacial interactions in bP&#8208;Pc nanohybrids that are relevant for application in 2D organic/inorganic devices.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Literature on Group One organoelement chemistry is dominated by lithium, though sodium and potassium also feature prominently, whereas rubidium and caesium are rarely mentioned. With recent breakthroughs hinting that organoelement compounds of these two heavier metals can perform better than their lighter congeners in particular applications, important advantages could be missed unless complete sets of alkali metals are included in studies. Here, we report the synthesis and characterisation of a complete set of multi&#8208;alkali&#8208;metallated molecular compounds of the 1,3,5&#8208;tris[(4,6&#8208;dimethylpyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)aminomethyl]&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triethylbenzene framework. Made by deprotonating the framework N&#8208;H bonds by a suitable base, the set comprises six THF&#8208;solvated compounds, four of which are homometallic, either containing Li in a trinuclear structure or Na, K, and Rb in hexanuclear structures. Since deprotonation was incomplete with Cs, its homometallic compound is tetranuclear containing two un&#8208;metallated N&#8208;H bonds. A heterobimetallic trilithium&#8208;tricaesium hexanuclear compound was also obtained by using a bimetallic Li&#8208;Cs base for deprotonation. Such alkali&#8208;metallated frameworks are often precursors to other multimetallic frameworks with unique properties across different fields of science.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A (3+3)&#8208;cycloaddition to afford 2&#8208;azabiyclo[3.1.1]heptanes was realized by reacting highly strained aryl bicyclo[1.1.0]butane (BCBs) carboxylates with tosylated aziridines. Under Sc(OTf)3 catalysis the transformation proceeded smoothly under mild conditions to the corresponding bicyclic products bearing at the bridgeheads of the embedded four&#8208;membered ring aryl and ester moieties, respectively. This reaction is a rare example of a cycloaddition of two highly strained ring systems under Lewis acid catalysis.

Liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) of layered and non&#8208;layered materials has become a widely applied method for the preparation of 2D nanostructures with an extensive variety of applications. However, in most cases organic solvents are used as liquid phase which are often toxic and environmentally unfriendly and lead to low yields. In this work, we present water as a suitable liquid phase and dispersion medium for the exfoliation of layered and non&#8208;layered monoelemental solids from IVA, VA and VIA groups of the periodic table, such as silicon, tin, bismuth and tellurium. The 2D nanostructures, silicene, stanene, bismuthene and tellurene are therefore prepared by a completely sustainable and environmentally friendly method. The prepared Xenes, as they are called, are fully characterized by microscopic and spectroscopic techniques.</dc:description>

         <title>Orthogonal Functionalization of Oxo&#8208;Graphene Nanoribbons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxo&#8208;graphene nanoribbons (oxo&#8208;GNRs), created by unzipping single&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes (CNTs), are orthogonally functionalized at their rims and &#960;&#8208;surfaces using hydrazine derivatives and diazonium salts. This study highlights successful sequential functionalization of up to 40&#8201;% edge atoms and 4&#8201;% basal plane atoms. Such modifications enhance oxo&#8208;GNRs&#8217; potential in nanoelectronics and offer broader application possibilities for oxo&#8208;functionalized materials.







Abstract
Oxo&#8208;graphene nanoribbons (oxo&#8208;GNRs) can be prepared by the oxidative unzipping of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes. We present an orthogonal functionalization method for the functionalization of the rims and the &#960;&#8208;surface, respectively, what is only possible due to the high rim portion in oxo&#8208;GNRs. In particular, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy could be used to follow the reaction and detect the marker atoms contained in the addends. We propose that the reported orthogonal functionalization strategy can also be applied on other oxo&#8208;functionalized carbon materials, such as graphene quantum dots, or reduced graphene oxide flakes.

         <title>Realization of an Elusive U(III) Imido Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reduction of a U(IV) monoimido resulted in the first example of an elusive U(III) monoimido. The stability of this species was shown experimentally and theoretically to be due to K+ intercalation into the dimeric structure.







Abstract
Reduction of Cp*(TrippTerN)UI with KC8 generates (KCp*(TrippTerN)UI)2, the first example of a trivalent uranium imido, a previously elusive species, which are commonly unstable. Experimental and computational results indicate that the K+ coordination is responsible for this isolable U(III) monoimido complex.

         <title>Intersystem Crossing, Photo&#8208;Induced Charge Separation and Regioisomer&#8208;Specific Excited State Dynamics in Fully Rigid Spiro Rhodammine&#8208;Naphthalene/Anthraquinone Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Dyads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong dependence of photophysical properties on amino substitution positions of naphthalene chromophores was observed with two isomers. Long&#8208;lived charge separation state (&#964;CS=0.62&#8197;&#956;s) was observed with spiro fully rigid compact electron donor and acceptor orthogonal dyads using transient absorption spectra, and the triplet spin multiplicity of CS state is confirmed by time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectra.







Abstract
We prepared a series fully rigid spiro electron donor&#8208;acceptor orthogonal dyads, with closed form of rhodamine (Rho) as electron donor and naphthalene (Np)/anthraquinone (AQ) as electron acceptor, to access the long&#8208;lived triplet charge separation (3CS) state, via the electron spin control method. We found strong dependency of the photophysical property of the dyads on the amino substitution positions of the Np chromophores in the dyads 1,8&#8208;DaNp&#8208;Rho and 2,3&#8208;DaNp&#8208;Rho. Nanosecond transient absorption (ns&#8208;TA) spectra show the population of the 3LE state (lifetime: 47 &#956;s) for 2,3&#8208;DaNp&#8208;Rho, however, long&#8208;lived 3CS state was observed (&#964;CS=0.62&#8197;&#956;s) for AQ&#8208;Rho, with a CS quantum yield of &#934;CS=58&#8201;%. Based on femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) spectra, spin orbit charge transfer ISC (SOCT&#8208;ISC) is proposed to be responsible for the formation of the triplet states. Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectra of AQ&#8208;Rho indicate the presence of two states, a 3LE state with zero field splitting (ZFS) D parameter of 1400&#8197;MHz and E parameter of &#8722;410&#8197;MHz, formed via radical pair ISC (RP&#8208;ISC) and SOCT&#8208;ISC mechanism; and a 3CS state with the electron spin&#8208;spin interaction in the regime of spin&#8208;correlated radical pair (SCRP).

         <title>Metalized Borylene in Boron&#8208;Gold Carbonyl Complexes: Infrared Spectra and Theoretical Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cationic boron&#8722;gold carbonyl complexes that were mass&#8208;isolated and spectroscopically characterized in the gas phase are demonstrated to be inorganic analogues to borylenes and feature classical borylene reactivity to CO. In particular, the quasi&#8208;T&#8208;shaped BAu3+ examplifies an amphoteric metalized borylene stabilized by a unique multicenter covalent bond rather than the well&#8208;documented coordination tactics, disclosing a conceptually new platform for accessing borylenes with transition&#8208;metal&#8208;mimicking reactivity.







Abstract
Borylenes (:B&#8722;R) that are built on a single B&#8722;R bond between boron and another nonmetallic atom or group are a heated subject of special interest due to their intriguing transition&#8208;metal&#8208;mimicking reactivity, but the relative lack of understanding for the electronic structure and chemical bonding of transition metal borides leads to lingering neglect of metalized borylenes (:B&#8722;M) based on covalent B&#8722;M bonding. Here we use infrared photodissociation spectroscopy in combination with density functional calculations to study the geometric structure and chemical bonding of boron&#8208;gold carbonyl complex cations. The structure and bonding analyses demonstrated that the BAu(CO)3+ and BAu2(CO)4+ complexes can be described as bis&#8208;carbonyl&#8208;trapped borylene adducts. While the metal&#8208;rich BAu3(CO)4+ complex represents an unusual multicenter&#8208;bond&#8208;stabilized borylene cation with excellent &#963;&#8208;acidity and &#960;&#8208;backbonding capability for CO activation, featuring Cs symmetry with a quasi&#8208;T&#8208;shaped BAu3+ core. It is manifested that BAu3+ presents greater amphoteric reactivity and improved stability compared to BAu1,2+ due to the presence of the three&#8208;center&#8208;two&#8208;electron Au&#8722;B&#8722;Au bond. This study discloses a conceptually new platform for accessing reactive metalized borylenes by exploiting the boron&#8208;mediated multicenter&#8208;bond stabilization strategy and using more bench&#8208;stable and ubiquitous metal carbonyl fragments as starting materials, thus providing a broader opportunity for the design of novel chemical structures and catalytic reactions.

         <title>Beyond the Diffusion Limit: Pre&#8208;Associated Ion&#8208;Pair Photoinitiating Systems for Radical Photopolymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A super&#8208;stoichiometric photoinitiating system containing the dye cristal violet as a photoinitiator and an excess of borate as coinitiator was found to form a photoreactive ion&#8208;pair which reacts extremely rapidly under light excitation without any need of diffusional process.







Abstract
The pre&#8208;association mechanism of an ion&#8208;pair Type II photoinitiating system (PIS) acting in the visible range was studied. The choice of a dye as photoinitiator (crystal violet) with an excited state lifetime of 200&#8197;ps ensured the absence of dynamical quenching by the borate salts used as coinitiator. In spite of the fact that no diffusional bimolecular quenching can take place, excellent polymerization efficiency was found, underlining the high reactivity of the PIS. A saturation effect is observed when increasing the concentration of borate as a consequence of the pre&#8208;association mechanism arising from coulombic interaction between the cationic dye and the anionic coinitiator. The association equilibria of the system were described and the corresponding association constant values were calculated, allowing to quantify the pre&#8208;association efficiency. This was further successfully correlated to the observed maximal rates of polymerization. The efficiency of this super&#8208;stoichiometric sample with an excess of borate was finally compared to the stoichiometric 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 dye:borate ion&#8208;pair. It is shown that the pre&#8208;association mechanism could lead to much higher efficiency than the stoichiometric ion&#8208;pair.

         <title>PCET&#8208;driven Reactivity of Neptunyl(VI) Yields Oxo&#8208;bridged Np(V) and Np(IV) Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two unconventional polynuclear complexes of neptunium(Np) featuring mono&#8208;&#956;2&#8208;oxo motifs have been accessed by proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactivity involving the dissolution of neptunyl(VI) diacetate dihydrate (NpO2(OAc)2 (H2O)2&#8226;HOAc) in methanol followed by addition of a pentadentate Schiff&#8208;base ligand. One complex is a mixed&#8208;valent [NpV,NpIV,NpV] trimer with two bridging &#956;2&#8208;oxos and the other is a [NpV,NpV] dimer featuring a single &#956;2&#8208;oxo. In both complexes the outer Np centers are capped with terminal oxo ligands. Spectroscopic and spectrokinetic studies aimed at elucidating mechanistic details of complex formation in this system show that intermediate multinuclear [NpV O2(OAc)]n species form prior to metal chelation by the ligand; electrolysis experiments demonstrate that production of Np(V) gives rise to asynchronous proton transfer that does not occur otherwise (in the Np(VI) state) as well as condensation with loss of H2O and formation of the polynuclear complexes. We attribute the oxo&#8208;deficient nature of these products, with respect to conventional actinyl ([AnO2]m+) species, to the reduction/condensation reaction sequence of PCET.</dc:description>

         <title>Ordered Assembly of Natural Phenolic Building Blocks for Supramolecular Crystalline Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biomacromolecules such as DNA, proteins, and lipids in nature are constructed by 'bottom&#8208;up' assembly with diverse functions and structural ordered characteristics. Supramolecular assemblies have been employed to mimic the natural complexity by manipulating the subtle variations of functional groups. Nevertheless, the intricate design of the driving forces or sophisticated synthesis of molecular skeletons poses challenges in fabricating highly ordered assemblies. Natural phenolic molecules with anisotropic functional groups exhibit potential as versatile building blocks for a wide range of supramolecular crystalline materials with tailored assembly and controlled functionalities. The inherent and anisotropic phenolic groups engage in ordered assembly with various materials via directional covalent bonds (e.g., condensation and coordination) as well as multiple molecular interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions), leading to the formation of supramolecular crystalline materials with diverse functionalities. This Concept presents the assembly mechanisms of crystalline phenolic materials and their applications, showcasing the effective utilization of ordered assembly by natural phenolic building blocks.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering Co(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H Annulation Towards Maleimide&#8208;Fused Imidazopyridine AEEgens&#8224;</title>

         <dc:description>A cobalt(III)&#8208;catalyzed dual C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp2)&#8722;H activation of 2&#8208;arylimidazopyridines and its annulation with N&#8208;substituted maleimides leads to polycyclic aromatic heterocycles. This sustainable oxidative annulation uses earth&#8208;abundant, less toxic, and cost&#8208;effective cobalt(III) catalyst that complement expensive 2nd and 3rd&#8208;row metals. This oxidative annulation features a broad substrate scope with very good functional group tolerance. These maleimide&#8208;fused imidazopyridines display strong fluorescence in the region of 527&#8722; 536 nm with a Stokes shift of 83&#8722;87 nm and possess an excited state lifetime of 14.6&#8722;16.1 ns. Interestingly, such luminescent compounds show aggregation&#8208;enhanced emission (AEE) behavior in the iPr&#8208;OH/hexane mixed solvent system. Furthermore, field emission scanning microscopy (FESEM) reveals their spherical nano&#8208;aggregates with an average diameter of ~216.8 nm. They can also be used as cellular&#8208;imaging and picric acid&#8208;sensing probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Chloride&#8208;Dependent Uncaging Reaction of Propargyl and Allene&#8208;Protected Substrates by Pd&#8208;Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study investigates the effect of chloride levels on the mode of action of palladium complexes for the activation of propargyl&#8208; and allene&#8208;protected fluorophores and chemotherapeutic drugs through uncaging reactions. Four Pd(II) complexes were synthesized and characterized using spectroscopic techniques to confirm their structure and electronic properties. Kinetic studies and density functional theory calculations revealed that chloride ions in PBS significantly enhance catalytic efficiency, particularly for allenyl&#8208;protected substrates compared to propargylic counterparts. This enhancement is attributed to the neutral charge nature of the Pd complex. The data suggest that neutral complexes are less prone to chloride exchange by water molecules. Additionally, chloride ligands counterbalance the unusually high stability of the key &#963;&#8208;bound &#951;1&#8208;Pd intermediates in the aquo complexes in PB, leading to higher reactivity. These results highlight the impact of fine&#8208;tuning the electronic properties of the metal center through both designed ligands and environmental factors. Bench evaluations and tests with living breast cancer cells demonstrated that a Pd catalyst complex with a bidentate ligand effectively activates the prodrugs propargyl&#8208;5&#8208;fluorouracil (Prop&#8208;5FU) and allene&#8208;5&#8208;Fluorouracil (Alle&#8208;5FU), the latter being a novel prodrug. The Pd catalyst successfully released the active drug, inducing cytotoxicity, especially with Alle&#8208;5FU, which operates at lower catalyst concentrations than Pro&#8208;5FU.</dc:description>

         <title>Polysilsesquioxane Open Hollow Spheres for Heavy Metal Ions Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hollow microspheres with open windows on the shells have shown significant potential in adsorption, catalysis, and drug delivery fields, owing to their low density, large interior volume, high specific surface area, and abundant availability of adsorption sites. However, creating open hollow spheres with structurally stable and entirely organic&#8208;functionalized surfaces remains a challenge. Herein, we fabricated polysilsesquioxane open hollow spheres using trialkoxysilane containing mercaptopropyl groups under vigorous stirring, employing polystyrene microspheres as template. Various reaction parameters were explored, revealing stirring speed as the key factor influencing the morphology and openness of the microspheres. By examining the morphology of intermediate products at different reaction times, we proposed a step&#8208;growth mechanism for microsphere formation. The resulting materials exhibited high adsorption capacity and selectivity towards Hg2+ and Pb2+, attributed to the presence of thiol groups and the open&#8208;hollow structure. Our approach provides a robust method for producing open hollow materials with functionalized surfaces, offering potential applications in the adsorption field.</dc:description>

         <title>Insights into Structural Diversity and Morphotropic Evolution in A4Th(WO4)4 (A = Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs) Family</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of four new thorium tungstates, A4Th(WO4)4 (A = Li, K, Rb, Cs), were synthesized using high&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state method. Structural studies of the materials reveal distinct structural changes with underlying similarities influenced by the nature of A&#8208;site cations. Li4Th(WO4)4 exhibits a two&#8208;dimensional corrugated sheet structure stabilized by Li+ cations, crystallizing in P space group. K4Th(WO4)4 crystallizes in I41/a space group and exhibits a three&#8208;dimensional framework consisting of ThO8 antiprisms and WO4 tetrahedra. Rb4Th(WO4)4 forms in C2/c space group, showcasing a framework with two&#8208;dimensional sheet structure. Cs4Th(WO4)4 is isostructural to Rb4Th(WO4)4 but displays increased interlayer spacing due to the larger ionic radius of Cs. Raman spectroscopy confirms the structural data, revealing distinct vibrational modes that correlate with tungsten coordination changes from WO6 in Li4Th(WO4)4 to WO4 in the Cs4Th(WO4)4. This study demonstrates how variation of alkali metals affects the structural properties of thorium tungstates series, showing a morphotropic evolution as a factor of the ionic radii of the alkali metals.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydridostannylene Derivatives of Magnesium and Calcium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactions of a m&#8208;terphenylhydridostannylene with&#160; &#946;&#8208;diketiminato&#160; magnesium and calcium hydrides provide bis&#8208;&#956;2&#8208;hydrido species, the heterobimetallic constitutions of which are maintained after the addition of THF donor solvent. In both cases, reactions with hex&#8208;1&#8208;ene result in the formation of tetravalent organostannyl alkaline earth derivatives. Whereas the magnesium reagent undergoes facile twofold addition, the calcium&#8208;centered process is arrested after a single alkene reduction event. This contrasting behavior is assessed to result from the heavier alkaline earth element&#8217;s ability to form a persistent polyhapto interaction with an arene substituent of the m&#8208;terphenyl ligand.</dc:description>

         <title>Nucleophilic Triphenylgermanides of Magnesium and Calcium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dimeric calcium and magnesium hydrides, [(BDI)AeH]2 [BDI = HC{(Me)CNDipp}2, Dipp = 2,6&#8208;i&#8208;Pr&#173;2C6H3;&#173; Ae = Mg or Ca] do not react with Ph3GeH in non&#8208;coordinating solvent. Addition of THF, however, induces deprotonation and access to monomeric Ae&#8208;germanide complexes, [(BDI)Ae{GePh3}(THF)], both of which have been structurally characterized. Although this process is facile when Ae = Ca, the analogous magnesium&#8208;based reaction requires heating to temperatures &gt;100 &#176;C, under which conditions germanide formation is complicated by THF ring opening and the generation of an alkaline earth germyl&#8208;C&#8208;terminated n&#8208;butoxide, [(BDI)|Mg{&#956;2&#8208;O(CH2)4GePh3}]. Reactions of [(BDI)Ca{GePh3}(THF)] with N,N'&#8208;di&#8208;isopropylcarbodiimide and benzophenone provide the respective germylamidinate and germylalkoxide derivatives, [(BDI)Ca{(i&#8208;PrN)2CGePh3}(THF)] and [(BDI)Ca{OC(GePh3)Ph2}(THF)], demonstrating its potential as a well&#8208;defined and soluble source of the [Ph3Ge]&#8722; anion in nucleophilic addition reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclodextrin&#8208;encapsulated NHCs: increased selectivity and reactivity of CO2 in amine formylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe the confinement of a N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) organocatalyst in the cavity of cyclodextrins (CDs). These confined organocatalysts allow the formylation of amines through CO2 hydrosilylation. The presence of the cavity of the CDs leads to substrate&#8208;selectivity between amines in competition reactions. The use of the smallest &#945;&#8208;CD induces the best selectivities but also to increased reactivity compared to the bigger &#946;&#8208;CD. A careful study conducted by NMR and DFT revealed that in &#945;&#8208;CD, the complexed CO2 interacts with the cavity through hydrogen bonds. These H&#8208;bonds destabilize the NHC&#8211;CO2 adduct and are accountable for the higher reactivity observed using &#945;&#8208;CD.</dc:description>

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Thioglycosylated Monolignol Probes for Bioimaging of Lignin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lignin biosynthesis is a critical process that underpins plant structural integrity and defenses. Central to this pathway are monolignol glucosides (MLGs), whose role as intermediates remains debated. To elucidate MLGs&#8217; involvement, we developed thioglycosylated monolignol probes compatible with click chemistry for in situ visualization of lignin biosynthesis. Using a highly selective Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig&#8211;Migita cross&#8208;coupling approach, these probes incorporate glycosyl thiols into MLGs, creating stable thioacetal bonds to enhance both metabolic stability and tracking precision. The unique chemistry of these probes allows for incorporation within the lignification pathway, enabling specific visualization of MLG involvement in lignin formation. The probes are compatible with bioorthogonal chemistry labeling and confocal microscopy, allowing detailed tracking of MLG transport, storage, and incorporation into cell walls. Our findings provide new insights into lignification dynamics, underscoring the metabolic roles of MLGs and demonstrating their potential as metabolic intermediates in lignin polymerization. This approach offers a novel chemical biology toolset to dissect plant cell wall biosynthesis and will help elucidatethe molecular roles of MLGs in the context of plant biochemistry and resilience.</dc:description>

         <title>Adsorption and Thermal Evolution of the Carbonyl&#8208;Functionalized Ionic Liquid [5&#8208;oxo&#8208;C6C1Im][NTf2] on Pt(111): A Combined IRAS, STM, and DFT Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The coating of heterogeneous catalysts with ionic liquids enables precise tuning of catalytic activity and selectivity. Recently, the fundamentals of solid catalysts with ionic liquid layers have been extensively studied. So far, investigations have focused on simple ILs without specialized functional groups. In our current work, we aim to involve functionalized ILs to take advantage of the interactions between these functional groups, the catalyst, and the reactants.
In this study, we investigated the interaction, and thermal stability of the carbonyl&#8208;functionalized IL [5&#8208;oxo&#8208;C6C1Im][NTf2] on Pt(111) by infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy. In addition, we performed density functional theory calculations to support our interpretation.
At 200 K and low coverage, the carbonyl group of the [5&#8208;oxo&#8208;C6C1Im]+ cation is oriented parallel to the Pt(111) surface. With increasing coverage, the alkyl chain detaches from the surface and orients towards the vacuum. The [NTf2]&#8208; anion adsorbs parallel to the surface via the oxygen atoms of the SO2 groups. At higher coverage, at least one of the SO2 groups completely detaches from the surface. Upon heating to 250 K, we observe decomposition and partial desorption of [5&#8209;oxo&#8208;C6C1Im][NTf2], with further decomposition and desorption occurring between 350 and 400 K.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Ni2+ activated phosphor has attracted wide attention because it can be radiated in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) II&#8208;III region; however, the low external quantum yield (EQY) hinders its further application (most are below 8%). In this work, distortion of crystallographic site strategy is proposed to enhance EQY. LaTiTaO6: 0.004Ni2+ exhibits an NIR emitting spectrum centered at 1450 nm with an EQY of ~ 9.00%, which has been the highest EQY of reported Ni2+ single&#8208;doped phosphor. Distortion degrees of the octahedral geometry in LaTiTaO6 and LaTiTaO6: 0.004Ni2+ changing from 0.038 to 0.047 result in the absorption efficiency of 38.6% due to the breaking of parity forbidden of the d&#8208;d transition, further improving the EQY. Besides, LaTiTaO6: 0.004Ni2+ mixed with LaTiTaO6: 0.04Cr3+ phosphors have demonstrated their application for spectral analysis. This work provides a new idea for constructing efficient NIR&#8208;II to NIR&#8208;III phosphors.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Aggregation&#8208;induced Electrochemiluminescence Performance of Covalent Organic Frameworks with Electron&#8208;rich Conjugated Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since aggregation&#8208;induced electrochemiluminescence (AIECL) luminophore overcomes the restriction of aggregation&#8208;caused quenching in solid luminescent materials, AIECL luminophore has become a promising material in the field of electrochemiluminescence (ECL) engineering. However, the lack of ECL emitters with high AIECL performance limits its wide application. Herein, imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with C4 symmetrical tetraphenyl ethylene and C2 symmetrical five&#8208;membered heteroaromatic monomers are designed as ECL emitter in aqueous media. Significantly, the ECL intensity of COFs with terthienyl units (TTA&#8208;TAPE) is 206 times that of COFs with furan units in the presence of tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine (TPrA), which is the result of enhancing ECL signals by increasing the thiophene units and &#960;&#8208;&#960; conjugation of COFs. Furthermore, the ECL mechanism of these COFs is vested in the bandgap model. Thus, the study provides a strategy for designing highly efficient ECL&#8208;active COFs emitters with excellent AIECL efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Activation of CO2, CS2, and COS by &#945;&#8208;Diimine&#8208;Stabilized Gallylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New &#945;&#8208;diimine&#8208;ligated gallylenes [LGa:]&#8722; were synthesized, which react with CO2, CS2, and COS via diverse pathways. 1) Reductive disproportionation of CO2 gives carbonate and oxo&#8208;carbonate complexes; 2) Reductive coupling of CS2 affords ethenetetrathiolate [C2S4]4&#8722; complexes; 3) Reductive disproportionation of COS yields a disulfide&#8208;bridged complex or a dithiocarbonate (S2CO)2&#8722; complex.







Abstract
Several gallylenes [LPhGaM(THF)n] stabilized by an &#945;&#8208;diimine ligand (LPh=[(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3)NC(Ph)]22&#8722;; M=Li, n=3, 3&#8208;Li; M=Na, n=4, 3&#8208;Na; M=K, n=1, 3&#8208;K) were prepared, which display diverse reactivities toward carbon dioxide and its sulfurized analogues. The reaction of 3 with CO2 yielded a trimeric carbonate complex [{LPhGa(CO3)2}3{&#956;&#8208;K9(THF)6}] (4) and a dinuclear oxo&#8208;carbonate complex [K2(THF)6][LPhGa(&#956;&#8208;CO3)(&#956;&#8208;O)GaLPh] (5) in one pot through reductive disproportionation of CO2. For CS2, two ethenetetrathiolate gallium complexes, [M2(Solv)4][LPhGa(&#956;&#8208;C2S4)GaLPh] (M=Na, Solv=THF, 6; M=K, Solv=DME, 7), were obtained via reductive coupling of CS2. In the case of COS, disproportionation gave a disulfide&#8208;bridged complex [K2(THF)6] [LPhGa(&#956;&#8208;S)2GaLPh] (8) at room temperature, but a dithiocarbonate [Na2(THF)5][LPhGa(S2CO)]2 (9) at low temperature, the latter being the first example of dithiocarbonates of p&#8208;block elements.

         <title>Expanding the Toolset of Biomolecular NMR with Efficient and Cost&#8208;Effective 17O&#8208;Labeling via Bacterial Expression</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxygen plays a central role in biomolecular structures and functions, with&#160;17O NMR emerging as a powerful tool for elucidating biomolecular properties. However, the low natural abundance of the NMR&#8208;active isotope,&#160;17O (0.0373%), presents a significant hurdle to its widespread application. Here, we introduce a rapid and cost&#8208;effective approach for amino acid&#8208;specific&#160;17O&#8208;labeling of recombinant proteins. Using a common bacterial expression system and with a 30&#8208;minute rapid synthesis protocol of&#160;17O&#8208;labeled amino acids via mechanochemical saponification,&#160;we have generated Leu&#8208; and Phe&#8208;specific&#160;17O&#8208;labeled recombinant proteins derived from diverse organisms, including CrgA and FtsQ from&#160;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&#160;and E protein from SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus, demonstrating the applicability of our technique for amino acids known to be isotopically labeled without scrambling. We have acquired magic&#8208;angle&#8208;spinning&#160;17O NMR of these proteins to confirm the successful&#160;17O labeling and illustrate the sensitivity of&#160;17O NMR to the protein&#8217;s local structural environments. Our work significantly broadens the accessibility of&#160;17O&#8208;NMR, empowering researchers to delve deeper into protein biophysics and biochemistry. This approach opens new avenues for understanding cellular processes at the molecular level by providing an effective tool for investigating oxygen&#8208;related interactions and chemistry within biomolecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Photogeneration and Direct Observation of a 2H&#8208;Phosphirene and a Closed&#8208;Shell Singlet Arylphosphenium Ion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphenium ions are highly reactive species with the formula of RR`P+. Although phosphenium ions were proposed as the invaluable intermediates of various important chemical processes, the methods to generate and characterize them were very limited. In this study, a novel photoprecursor to give rise to the arylphosphenium ions, 1&#8208;(naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phosphirane, was synthesized and investigated by femtosecond to nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopies, photoproduct analysis, and density functional theory calculations. Subsequent to photoexcitation, the S1&#160;state of the photoprecursor of interest is populated from the higher excited states, accompanied by the generation of an unexpected 2H&#8208;phosphirene, 7bH&#8208;naphtho[1,2&#8208;b]phosphirene. After that, the resulted 2H&#8208;phosphirene is protonated by H2O in the solvent to generate the naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl(hydryl)phosphenium ion, which can be attacked by H2O and oxidized by O2&#160;to give naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ylphosphinic acid as the major final product. The presence of these transient species is confirmed by density functional theory calculation and control experiments with different solvents. This study provides an understanding of the reactivity of arylphosphenium ions as well as 2H&#8208;phosphirenes, and provides a novel method to generate and characterize these reactive species, which may help to further reveal their reactivity and explore their chemistry and use in a range of applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Mo&#8211;O&#8211;Sn Bond Boosting Kinetics of MoO2&#8722;xSnO2/Sn Anode for High&#8208;Performance Li&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Obtaining a robust electrode composed of Sn&#8208;based metal oxides and carbonaceous matrix through nanoscale structure engineering is essential for effectively improving Li&#8208;ion batteries' electrochemical performance and stability. Herein, we report a bimetallic MoO2&#8208;xSnO2/Sn nanoparticles uniformly anchored on N, S co&#8208;doped graphene nanosheets (MoO2&#8208;xSnO2/Sn@NSG) as an anode electrode for Li&#8208;ion battery via a one&#8208;step hydrothermal and thermal treatment approach. In the MoO2&#8208;xSnO2/Sn nanocomposite, the generated Sn&#8208;O&#8208;Mo bond can modulate the electronic and composition structures to improve the intrinsic conductivity of SnO2 and reinforce the structural stability during cycles. Moreover, featuring excellent electronic conductivity via coupling of MoO2&#8208;xSnO2/Sn and hierarchical NBG matrix, the MoO2&#8208;xSnO2/Sn@NSG electrode possesses ultrafast electrochemical kinetics and superior long&#8208;term cycling stability and rate capability. Additionally, the hierarchical MoO2&#8208;2SnO2/Sn@NSG can suppress the aggregation and accommodate the volume variations of active substances, thereby providing more lithium storage sites. Consequently, the optimized MoO2&#8208;2SnO2/Sn@NSG anode exhibits a high reversible capacity of 904 mA h g&#8208;1 at 0.2 A g&#8208;1 and excellent cycling performance with the reversible capacity of 456 mAh g&#8208;1 at 1 A g&#8208;1 over 600 cycles. The universal synthesis technology of bimetallic oxide anodes for advanced LIBs may provide vital guidance in designing high&#8208;performance energy&#8208;storage materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing cyanine&#8208;like properties to develop bright fluorogenic probes based on viscosity&#8208;sensitive molecular rotors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dipolar fluorescent molecular rotors (FMRs) are environmentally&#8208;sensitive fluorophores that can be used in bioimaging applications to sense local viscosity and polarity. Their sensitivity to viscosity can also be used for the fluorogenic labeling of biomolecules such as DNA or proteins. In particular, we have previously used FMRs to develop a series of tunable fluorogens targeting the self&#8208;labeling protein tag Halotag for wash&#8208;free protein imaging in live cells. Despite these very useful properties, FMRs typically display moderate molar absorption coefficients that limits their overall fluorescence brightness. Herein, we synthesized a series of three model hemicyanines based on a styrylindolenium scaffold and performed a detailed study of their photophysical properties in solvents with various polarity and viscosity. We show that with a strong julolidine electron&#8208;donating group it is possible to combine intense cyanine&#8208;like absorption with the high sensitivity to viscosity of FMRs. We use this property to develop a lysosomal pH sensor and two bright cell&#8208;impermeant fluorogens targeting HaloTag for imaging membrane proteins. We believe that this bright fluorogenic scaffold based on a simple chemical structure can be used in the future to build up a variety of probes and sensors with efficient photophysical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Br&#248;nsted&#8208;Acid Catalyzed Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Synthesis of Spiroisoindolinones from Enamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly stereoselective Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acid catalyzed synthesis of densely substituted spiroisoindolinones from enamides and 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;isoindolinones is described. With simple Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acids, such as para&#8208;toluene sulfonic acid, spiroisoindolinones with three contiguous stereogenic centers are formed in high yields (up to 97%) and diastereoselectivities (up to &gt; 98:&lt;2:0:0 dr) under mild reaction conditions. With the use of a chiral phosphoric acid catalyst, a diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective synthesis of the corresponding spiroisoindolinones was achieved. Mechanistic investigations indicate a step&#8208;wise mechanism via an initial addition of the enamide to an electrophilic N&#8208;acylimine species followed by an intramolecular aza&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction. Addition of a strong Lewis acid can be used facilitate the second step for less reactive substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Apoptosis&#8208;Inducing Activity of a 2&#8208;Hydroxyphenyl Benzamide&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Assembled Anion Channel</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the significant interest in designing artificial ion channels, there is limited availability of channel&#8208;forming molecules to tackle complex issues, especially in biological systems. Moreover, a major challenge is the scarcity of chloride transporters that can selectively induce toxicity in cancer cells while minimizing harm to normal healthy cells. This work reports a series of 2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl benzamide&#8208;based small molecules 1a&#8722;1c, which self&#8208;assemble to form barrel rosette&#8208;type artificial ion channels that selectively transport chloride ions across membranes. The formation of these ion channels primarily relies on intermolecular hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions, as supported by the analysis of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Importantly, chloride ion transport by these compounds specifically triggers apoptosis in cancer cells while demonstrating relatively low toxicity toward non&#8208;cancerous cell lines.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Warburg effect, generates increased demand of glucose in cancer but&#160;is relatively underexplored phenomenon in existing commercial anti&#8208;cancer drugs. Here, we present a&#160;Ru(II)&#8208;bis&#8208;bipyridyl&#8208;morphocumin complex (2) encapsulated in a self&#8208;assembling glucose&#8208;functionalized co&#8208;polymer P(G&#8208;EMA&#8208;co&#8208;MMA) (where G = glucose; MMA = methyl methacrylate; EMA = ethyl methacrylate), designed to exploit Warburg effect and enhance cancer selectivity. The P(G&#8208;EMA&#8208;co&#8208;MMA) polymer, synthesized via reversible&#8208;addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization, has a number average molecular weight (Mn, NMR) of 8000 g/mol. Complex 2, stable in aqueous media, selectively releases a cytotoxic, lysosome&#8208;targeting compound morphocumin in the presence of excess&#160;H2O2, a reactive oxygen species (ROS) prevalent in tumor microenvironments. Complex 2 promotes ROS accumulation enhancing morphocumin release through a synergistic domino effect. Comparatively,&#160;2 outperforms its curcumin Ru(II) complex (1) in solution stability, organelle specificity, and cellular mechanisms. Both 1 and 2 exhibit phototherapeutic effects under low&#8208;intensity visible light, but their dark toxicity surpasses their photoactivity, highlighting they are&#160;superior as chemotherapeutic agents. Complex 2 induces apoptosis via mitochondrial pathway with 9&#8208;fold increase in selectivity for pancreatic cancer cells (MIA PaCa&#8208;2) over non&#8208;cancerous HEK293 cells when delivered encapsulated in&#160;glucose&#8208;conjugated polymer (DP@2)activity&#160;enhance further&#160;5&#8208;fold by glucose deprivation underscoring their potential in targeted cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantum&#8208;Classical Simulations Reveal the Photoisomerization Mechanism of a Prototypical First&#8208;Generation Molecular Motor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light&#8208;driven molecular rotary motors convert the energy of absorbed light into unidirectional rotational motion and are key components in the design of molecular machines. The archetypal class of light&#8208;driven rotary motors is chiral overcrowded alkenes, where the rotational movement is achieved through consecutive cis&#8208;trans photoisomerization reactions and thermal helix inversion steps. While the thermal steps have been rather well understood by now, our understanding of the photoisomerization reactions of overcrowded alkene&#8208;based motors still misses key points that would explain the striking differences in operation efficiency of the known systems. Here, we employ quantum&#8208;chemical calculations and nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the excited&#8208;state decay and photoisomerization mechanism in a prototypical alkene&#8208;based first&#8208;generation rotary motor. We show that the initially excited bright state undergoes an ultrafast relaxation to multiple excited&#8208; state minima separated by low energy barriers and reveal a slow picosecond&#8208;timescale decay to the ground state, which only occurs from a largely twisted dark excited&#8208;state minimum, far from any conical&#8208;intersection point. Additionally, we attribute the origin of the high yields of forward photoisomerization in our investigated motor to the favorable topography of the ground&#8208;state potential energy surface, which is controlled by the conformation of the central cyclopentene rings.</dc:description>

Additionally, we attribute the origin of the high yields of forward photoisomerization in our investigated motor to the favorable topography of the ground-state potential energy surface, which is controlled by the conformation of the central cyclopentene rings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;resolution Molecular Dynamics Simulations of the Pyruvate Kinase Muscle Isoform 1 and 2 (PKM1/2).</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glucose metabolism plays a pivotal role in physiological processes and cancer growth. The final stage of glycolysis, converting phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) into pyruvate, is catalyzed by the pyruvate kinase (PK) enzyme. Whereas PKM1 is mainly expressed in cells with high energy requirements, PKM2 is preferentially expressed in proliferating cells, including tumor cells. Structural analysis of PKM1 and PKM2 is essential to design new molecules with antitumoral activity. To understand their structural dynamics, we performed extensive high&#8208;resolution molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using adaptive sampling techniques coupled to the polarizable AMOEBA force field. Performing more than 6 &#181;s of simulation, we considered all oligomerization states of PKM2 and propose structural insights for PKM1 to further study the PKM2&#8208;specific allostery. We focused on key sites including the active site and the natural substrate Fructose Bi&#8208;Phosphate (FBP) fixation pocket. Additionally, we present the first MD simulation of biologically active PKM1 and uncover important similarities with its PKM2 counterpart \textcolor{red}{bound} to FBP. We also analysed TEPP&#8208;46&#8217;s fixation, a pharmacological activator binding a different pocket, on PKM2 and highlighted the structural differences and similarities compared to PKM2 bound to FBP. Finally, we determined potential new cryptic pockets specific to PKM2 for drug targeting.</dc:description>

         <title>Partially Sulfated Pillar[5]arenes: Synthesis and Molecular Recognition Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis and characterization of sulfated pillar[5]arene hosts (P5S2 &#8211; P5S10) that differ in the number of sulfate substituents. All five P5Sn hosts display high solubility in water (73 &#8211; 131 mM) and do not undergo significant self&#8208;association according to 1H NMR dilution experiments. The x&#8208;ray crystal structures of P5S6, P5S6&#8226;Me6HDA, P5S8&#8226;Me6HDA, and P5S10&#8226;Me6HDA reveal one intracavity molecule of Me6HDA and several external molecules of Me6HDA which form a network of close methonium&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;sulfate interactions. The thermodynamic parameters of complexation between P5Sn and the panel of guests was measured by direct or competitive isothermal titration calorimetry. We find that the binding free energy toward a guest becomes more negative as the number of sulfate substituents increase. Conversely, the binding free energy of a specific sulfated pillar[5]arene toward a homologous series of guests becomes more negative as the number of NMe groups increases. The ability to tune the host&#8226;guest affinity by changing the number of sulfate substituents will be valuable in supramolecular polymers, separation materials, and latching applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistical Study on Substrate&#8208;Controlled Highly Selective [2+2] and [2+3] Cycloaddition Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbons have acquired increased interests recently because of their potential applications in electronic devices. On metal surfaces, the selective synthesis of four&#8208; and five&#8208;membered carbon rings remains challenging due to the presence of diverse reaction pathways. Here, utilizing the same precursor molecule, we successfully achieved substrate&#8208;controlled highly selective cycloaddition reactions towards four&#8208; and five&#8208;membered carbon rings. A 97% yield for four&#8208;membered carbon rings on Au(111), while a 96% yield towards five&#8208;membered carbon rings is achieved on Ag(111). The detailed topological structures of the reaction products are carefully examined by bond&#8208;resolving scanning tunneling microscopy (BR&#8208;STM) imaging with a CO functionalized tip. The underlying mechanism of the novel surface&#8208;directed reaction selectivity is elucidated by extensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our study paves the way for high selective synthesis of polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbons with non&#8208;benzenoid rings.</dc:description>

The reaction is enabled by addition of an in situ generated nickel hydride across an olefin prior to C&#8211;N bond&#8208;formation. Stereodivergence can be accomplished on kinetic or thermodynamic grounds, thus giving access to either &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;glycosides with equal ease.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By liquid&#8208;crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (LCDSA) of copolymers consisting of star&#8208;like PAMAM and chain termini of liquid crystalline Azo units (PAMAM&#8208;Azo6), uniform multi&#8208;morphology fried&#8208;egg&#8208;like micelles containing an inner spherical/bowl&#8208;like core and platelet&#8208;like structure protruded for the core can be generated. It is found that the aggregation rate of PAMAM&#8208;Azo6 is one of the most important factors determining LCDSA behavior and morphology of formed micelles.







Abstract
Liquid&#8208;crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (LCDSA) has recently emerged as an efficient strategy to create uniform one&#8208;dimensional (1&#8208;D), 2&#8208;D and 3&#8208;D nanostructures in a controlled manner. However, the examples of generation of uniform multi&#8208;morphology nanostructures from solution self&#8208;assembly of one single polymer sample are rare. Herein, we report the first example of preparation of multi&#8208;morphology fried&#8208;egg&#8208;like nanostructures consisting of an inner spherical/bowl&#8208;like core of uniform size and platelets protruded from the core by LCDSA of PAMAM&#8208;Azo6 (PAMAM=polyamidoamine, Azo=azobenzene) in methanol. It is disclosed that the different aggregation rates for PAMAM&#8208;Azo6 with varying contents of Azo units spontaneously separated nucleation and growth stages, which led to the formation of inner spherical/bowl&#8208;like cores (&#8220;seeds&#8221;) firstly, followed by the formation of platelets protruded from the edges of inner core to give &#8220;imperfect&#8221; fried&#8208;egg&#8208;like nanostructures. Additional annealing of initially formed &#8220;imperfect&#8221; fried&#8208;egg&#8208;like micelles will promote the rearrangement of Azo units to give thermodynamically&#8208;favored &#8220;perfect&#8221; fried&#8208;egg&#8208;shaped micelles with a uniform dimension both in the core and whole structure. This work not only provides an efficient strategy to create uniform multi&#8208;morphology fried&#8208;egg&#8208;shaped nanostructures, but also reveals the essential impact of aggregation kinetics of liquid&#8208;crystalline&#8208;coil BCPs in the formation of multi&#8208;morphology nanostructures.

&lt;p&gt;By liquid-crystallization-driven self-assembly (LCDSA) of copolymers consisting of star-like PAMAM and chain termini of liquid crystalline Azo units (PAMAM-Azo&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), uniform multi-morphology fried-egg-like micelles containing an inner spherical/bowl-like core and platelet-like structure protruded for the core can be generated. It is found that the aggregation rate of PAMAM-Azo&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is one of the most important factors determining LCDSA behavior and morphology of formed micelles.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquid-crystallization-driven self-assembly (LCDSA) has recently emerged as an efficient strategy to create uniform one-dimensional (1-D), 2-D and 3-D nanostructures in a controlled manner. However, the examples of generation of uniform multi-morphology nanostructures from solution self-assembly of one single polymer sample are rare. Herein, we report the first example of preparation of multi-morphology fried-egg-like nanostructures consisting of an inner spherical/bowl-like core of uniform size and platelets protruded from the core by LCDSA of PAMAM-Azo&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (PAMAM=polyamidoamine, Azo=azobenzene) in methanol. It is disclosed that the different aggregation rates for PAMAM-Azo&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; with varying contents of Azo units spontaneously separated nucleation and growth stages, which led to the formation of inner spherical/bowl-like cores (&#8220;seeds&#8221;) firstly, followed by the formation of platelets protruded from the edges of inner core to give &#8220;imperfect&#8221; fried-egg-like nanostructures. Additional annealing of initially formed &#8220;imperfect&#8221; fried-egg-like micelles will promote the rearrangement of Azo units to give thermodynamically-favored &#8220;perfect&#8221; fried-egg-shaped micelles with a uniform dimension both in the core and whole structure. This work not only provides an efficient strategy to create uniform multi-morphology fried-egg-shaped nanostructures, but also reveals the essential impact of aggregation kinetics of liquid-crystalline-coil BCPs in the formation of multi-morphology nanostructures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Transparent Nonlinear Optical Phosphates: A New Alternative to Conventional Borates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Old Tree Blossoms Anew: The recent discovery of Mg2PO4Cl, which demonstrates a remarkable SHG response (5.2&#215;KDP), has reignited interest in non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated deep ultraviolet (DUV) transparent nonlinear optical (NLO) phosphates. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the latest advancements in DUV&#8208;transparent NLO phosphates and offers valuable insights into potential future directions for research in this field.







Abstract
Deep ultraviolet (DUV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals with balanced performance are crucial for extending laser wavelengths into the DUV region, essential for various laser applications. However, developing ideal DUV crystals is challenging due to stringent requirements: strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response, short cut&#8208;off wavelength, and effective phase&#8208;matching behavior. DUV NLO borates, which feature &#960;&#8208;conjugated groups, have garnered attention for their higher SHG coefficients compared to phosphates. However, phosphates typically show short UV cut&#8208;off edges due to the large HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap (approximately 9.6&#8197;eV) of the [PO&#8324;] units. To enhance the SHG effect while maintaining DUV transparency in phosphates, several strategies have been proposed: 1) using distorted polymerized P&#8722;O groups like isolated C&#8321;&#8208;[P&#8323;O&#8321;&#8320;]&#8309;&#8722; and [P&#8322;O&#8327;]&#8308;&#8722;; 2) aligning isolated [PO&#8324;]3&#8722; tetrahedra along the polar screw axis; 3) introducing additional NLO&#8208;active units; and 4) exploring new units derived from [PO&#8324;]3&#8722;, such as [PO&#8323;F]2&#8722; tetrahedra. These strategies have led to the successful development of various non&#8208;centrosymmetric phosphates, highlighting their potential as DUV NLO candidates. This review explores the relationship between their crystal structures and DUV NLO performance, and proposes future directions for developing ideal DUV NLO materials.

         <title>The Emissive and Electrochemical Properties of Hypervalent Pyridine&#8208;Dipyrrolide Bismuth Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report on hypervalent bismuth complexes, featuring ligands with the pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;bis(pyrrolide) motif. These complexes exhibit HOMO&#8594;LUMO transitions with ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal&#8208;charge transfer (LMCT) and interligand charge transfer (LL'CT) characteristics, as revealed by TD&#8208;DFT calculations. At 77&#8197;K, the complexes display red phosphorescence. Electrochemical and structural analyses demonstrate the influence of substituents on the electronic properties and the Lewis acidity of the Bi3+ ion.







Abstract
We present a series of six hypervalent bismuth complexes Bi(R1PDPR2)X bearing ligands characterized by the pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;bis(pyrrolide) (PDP) structural motif. While bismuth holds considerable potential for facilitating efficient intersystem crossing (ISC), reports on phosphorescent molecular bismuth complexes are still scarce and mostly based on systems that exhibit inter&#8208; or intraligand charge transfer character of their optical excitations. Herein, the UV/vis absorptive, luminescent, and electrochemical properties of complexes Bi(R1PDPR2)X are explored, where the substituents R1 and R2, as well as the halide ligand X are varied. These compounds are characterized by an intense HOMO&#8594;LUMO transition of mixed ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) and interligand charge transfer (LL'CT) character, as shown by time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations. At 77&#8197;K in a 2&#8208;MeTHF matrix, these compounds exhibit red, long&#8208;lived phosphorescence with lifetimes ranging from 479 to 14&#8197;&#956;s. Cyclic voltammetry measurements and TD&#8208;DFT calculations show that the substituents influence HOMO and LUMO energies to almost equal extent, resulting in nearly constant emission wavelengths throughout this series. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of four of the six complexes exemplify the inherent Lewis acidity of the coordinated Bi3+ ion, in spite of its hypervalency.

Two novel star&#8208;shaped fluorophores named PDI&#8722;S and PDI&#8722;Se are constructed by S/Se&#8208;fused perylene diimides (PDIs) connected with bicarbazole core. Particularly, PDI&#8722;S presents excellent two&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;action (&#948;TPA) of 3775&#8197;GM excited with 800&#8197;nm light, which is the highest value based on PDIs motif in the NIR&#8722;I region (700&#8211;900&#8197;nm).







Abstract
Two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) has attracted growing attention over recent years owing to the wide range of applications in organic nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. The quantitative sensitivity of a two&#8208;photon molecular entity is determined by its TPA cross&#8208;section (&#948;TPA). Perylene diimides (PDIs) are excellent n&#8208;type organic semiconductor materials demonstrating distinguished thermal, optical, and chemical stability. Nonetheless, PDIs&#8208;based scaffolds exhibit poor &#948;TPA in the NIR&#8722;I region (700&#8211;900&#8197;nm) due to the lack of suitable molecular design. Here, two novel star&#8208;shaped PDIs fluorophores, namely PDI&#8722;S and PDI&#8722;Se, were constructed by four periphery S/Se&#8208;fused PDIs connected with bicarbazole core. PDI&#8722;S manifested excellent &#948;TPA of 3775&#8197;GM, which are among the highest values reported for PDIs excited in the NIR&#8722;I region.

         <title>Study on Intelligent Bionic Superhydrophobic Material and its Oil&#8208;Water Separation Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Fe3O4@SiO2@PMMA&#8208;based smart bionic superhydrophobic material demonstrates efficient oil&#8208;water separation performance. With outstanding durability, chemical stability, and high separation efficiency for oil&#8208;water mixtures and emulsions, this material achieves a separation efficiency of up to 99.85&#8201;% and enables precise oil absorption under magnetic control, showcasing broad application prospects in ecological pollution management and oil spill remediation.







Abstract
Marine oil spills and improper disposal of daily oil usage have posed significant threat to ecological environments and human health due to rapid industrial development. In this study, an environmentally friendly, simple process and high&#8208;performance Fe3O4@SiO2@Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)&#8208;based smart bionic superhydrophobic oil&#8208;absorbing material was developed for effectively collecting and removing oil pollutants from water. By studying the effects of Fe3O4 particle size, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) concentration, and heating time on the superhydrophobicity of the materials, the directional regulation of superhydrophobicity and oil&#8208;water separation performance of Fe3O4@SiO2@PMMA@PDMS materials was realized. The results showed that the material exhibited optimal performance when the Fe3O4 particle size combination was 20/500&#8197;nm/1&#8197;&#956;m, the mass ratio of PDMS to Fe3O4@SiO2@PMMA was 7&#8201;:&#8201;1, and it was heated at 350&#176;C for 1&#8197;minute. The coating achieved an apparent contact angle (APCA) of 158.7&#176; and a rolling angle as low as 4.9&#176;. This coating not only remained superhydrophobic after a 21&#8197;m abrasion test and 288&#8197;h immersion in acid, alkali, salt, and high&#8208;temperature solutions, but also efficiently separated oil&#8208;water mixtures and water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsions, and the separation efficiency for oil&#8208;water mixtures of trichloromethane, dichloromethane and bromomethane was over 99.78&#8201;%, and that for water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsions was over 98.34&#8201;%. Furthermore, the superhydrophobic magnetic polyurethane (SFPU) sponge prepared using Fe3O4@SiO2@PMMA not only exhibited excellent oil&#8208;absorbing capacity (11&#8211;28&#8197;g/g), but also realized precise oil absorption at multiple sites by magnetic conduction. In the actual oily wastewater test, the oil&#8208;water separation efficiency of the sponge reached 90.58&#8201;% and the oil absorption capacity reached 17.03&#8197;g/g. This efficient oil&#8208;water separation performance as well as oil adsorption capacity comes from the fact that the nonpolar molecules (e.&#8201;g., &#8722;CH3) generated by the hydrolysis of PDMS can produce van der Waals adsorption with oil substances, while the excellent micro&#8208;nanostructure of the coating surface greatly increases the contact area between oil droplets and the coating, which can make them adsorb or pass through quickly. This multifunctional coating and sponge had immense application potential in fields like offshore oil spill treatment, organic pollution control in water bodies.

With outstanding durability, chemical stability, and high separation efficiency for oil-water mixtures and emulsions, this material achieves a separation efficiency of up to 99.85&#8201;% and enables precise oil absorption under magnetic control, showcasing broad application prospects in ecological pollution management and oil spill remediation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marine oil spills and improper disposal of daily oil usage have posed significant threat to ecological environments and human health due to rapid industrial development. In this study, an environmentally friendly, simple process and high-performance Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)-based smart bionic superhydrophobic oil-absorbing material was developed for effectively collecting and removing oil pollutants from water. By studying the effects of Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; particle size, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) concentration, and heating time on the superhydrophobicity of the materials, the directional regulation of superhydrophobicity and oil-water separation performance of Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@PMMA@PDMS materials was realized. The results showed that the material exhibited optimal performance when the Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; particle size combination was 20/500&#8197;nm/1&#8197;&#956;m, the mass ratio of PDMS to Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@PMMA was 7&#8201;:&#8201;1, and it was heated at 350&#176;C for 1&#8197;minute. The coating achieved an apparent contact angle (APCA) of 158.7&#176; and a rolling angle as low as 4.9&#176;. This coating not only remained superhydrophobic after a 21&#8197;m abrasion test and 288&#8197;h immersion in acid, alkali, salt, and high-temperature solutions, but also efficiently separated oil-water mixtures and water-in-oil emulsions, and the separation efficiency for oil-water mixtures of trichloromethane, dichloromethane and bromomethane was over 99.78&#8201;%, and that for water-in-oil emulsions was over 98.34&#8201;%. Furthermore, the superhydrophobic magnetic polyurethane (SFPU) sponge prepared using Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@PMMA not only exhibited excellent oil-absorbing capacity (11&#8211;28&#8197;g/g), but also realized precise oil absorption at multiple sites by magnetic conduction. In the actual oily wastewater test, the oil-water separation efficiency of the sponge reached 90.58&#8201;% and the oil absorption capacity reached 17.03&#8197;g/g. This efficient oil-water separation performance as well as oil adsorption capacity comes from the fact that the nonpolar molecules (e.&#8201;g., &#8722;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) generated by the hydrolysis of PDMS can produce van der Waals adsorption with oil substances, while the excellent micro-nanostructure of the coating surface greatly increases the contact area between oil droplets and the coating, which can make them adsorb or pass through quickly. This multifunctional coating and sponge had immense application potential in fields like offshore oil spill treatment, organic pollution control in water bodies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Site&#8208;Selective Defluorinative Etherification Between Unactivated Perfluoroarenes and Hydrobenzoxazoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using hydrobenzoxazoles as the surrogate of phenol, the first Pd(0) catalyzed synthesis of polyfluoaryl ethers motifs through selective C&#8722;F bond activation and C&#8722;O bond cleavage was described. This transformation proceeded under mild conditions, and exhibited broad substrate scope and ability for post&#8208;functionalization of natural products. DFT investigations suggested that oxidative addition step through C&#8722;F bond cleavage constitutes the rate&#8208;determining step.







Abstract
Polyfluoroaryl ethers represent an important framework of biologically active molecules and materials. Owing to the strong bond dissociation energy of C&#8722;F bond, selectivity and other issues, transition metal&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of polyfluoroaryl ethers from perfluoroarenes via the activation of C&#8722;F bond is challenging and underdeveloped, as compared to the well&#8208;documented C&#8722;O bond formation starting from aryl iodides, aryl bromides or aryl chlorides. Herein, an unprecedented Pd&#8208;catalyzed defluorinative etherification for the synthesis of polyfluoroaryl ether skeletons using hydrobenzoxazoles as phenol surrogate, has been reported. The substrate scope for this protocol is broad, with respect to hydrobenzoxazoles and perfluoroarenes, under mild reaction conditions. More importantly, challenging alkenyl and alkynyl substituted polyfluoroarenes could be successfully used as the cou&#8208;pling component for Pd&#8208;catalyzed etherification reaction. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to investigate the reaction mechanism, which suggested that oxidative addition between polyfluorobenzene and Pd(0) constituted the rate&#8208;determining step.

         <title>CoFe2O4 with the In&#8208;Situ Formed Oxygen Vacancies and Co Particles as an Efficient Bifunctional Catalyst for Rechargeable Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient bifunctional catalyst rGO&#8208;CoFe2O4/Co is synthesized by a simple hydrothermal reaction and one&#8208;step annealing process using cobalt nitrate and ferric nitrate as raw materials. The in&#8208;situ formed cobalt particles and oxygen vacancies optimize the adsorption energy of the catalyst for H2O and O2 molecules and contribute to the enhanced catalytic activity.







Abstract
Rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries (RZABs) are considered as one of the most promising clean energy device due to their abundant resources, low cost and environmental friendliness. However, their energy efficiency and cycle life are far from satisfactory due to the poor activity and stability of bi&#8208;functional electrocatalyst in air cathode. In this work, an efficient bi&#8208;functional catalyst (rGO&#8208;CoFe2O4/Co) was derived from its precursor (rGO&#8208;CoFe2O4) through a simple annealing process. Electrochemical measurements prove that rGO&#8208;CoFe2O4/Co with the in&#8208;situ formed Co nano particles and rich oxygen vacancies appears excellent oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction catalytic activity compared to its counterpart. Its half&#8208;wave potential is 0.81&#8197;V (vs RHE) and the OER overpotential is only 310&#8197;mV (vs RHE). In addition, rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries assembled with rGO&#8208;CoFe2O4/Co show the highest peak power density (128.9&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and cycling stability compared to rGO&#8208;CoFe2O4 and commercial Pt/C&#8208;RuO2 catalysts. This work provides a simple strategy for the design of advanced bifunctional catalysts.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boron atoms, due to their electron&#8208;deficient nature, have been extensively studied in luminescent, semiconductor, and chemical sensing materials. This review highlights the synthesis and properties of boron&#8208;containing graphene nanoribbons, covalent organic frameworks, and 2D conjugated polymers. Their tunable electronic structures pave the way for innovations in optoelectronics, catalysis, energy storage and etc.







Abstract
Organic two&#8208;dimensional materials have garnered widespread attention due to their well&#8208;defined structures, structural diversity, and rich electronic effects, demonstrating significant application potential across various fields. Atomic&#8208;level manipulation of the structures of organic two&#8208;dimensional materials has been a primary strategy for enriching and optimizing their properties. The introduction of heteroatoms often significantly affects their electronic structure, thereby endowing these materials with novel and unique properties. Boron atoms, due to their electron&#8208;deficient nature, have been extensively studied in luminescent materials, semiconductor materials, and chemical sensing materials. Consequently, boron&#8208;containing organic two&#8208;dimensional materials are also believed to be promising as a new class of materials with excellent optoelectronic and chemical activities. This article collates and summarizes the preparation and property studies of three types of boron&#8208;containing organic two&#8208;dimensional materials in recent years.

         <title>Ortho Arylation of N&#8208;Aryl Amides and the Construction of Diagonal Tetraarylbenzenediamines and N&#8208;Doped Fulminenes via BBr3&#8208;Derived Dibromoboracycles</title>

         <dc:description>
We report the discovery of a boron&#8208;driven ortho&#8208;arylation reaction of N&#8208;aryl amides and ureas. This novel method enables directed borylation of a wide range of substrates, leading to the synthesis of unique compounds such as N&#8208;doped fulminene and diagonal tetraarylbenzenediamines. These compounds hold significant promise for applications in pharmaceuticals, materials science, and organic synthesis.







Abstract
The synthesis of biaryl amides, which are prevalent motifs in bioactive molecules, often necessitates lengthy and inefficient procedures. To address these limitations, catalytic C&#8722;H activation protocols have emerged, enabling the direct ortho&#8208;arylation of aryl amides. However, these protocols often suffer from issues such as lack of selectivity, reliance on stoichiometric oxidants, and the requirement for excess reagents and harsh reaction conditions. To overcome these challenges, we present a novel and highly selective protocol for the ortho&#8208;arylation of N&#8208;aryl amides and ureas. The high selectivity originates from the directed installation of BBr3 to form a boracycle, which then undergoes cross&#8208;coupling with an aryl halide. Our method offers significant advantages, including mild reaction conditions, excellent site&#8208;specificity, and scalability. The protocol demonstrates broad compatibility with a diverse range of readily accessible functionalized anilides and aryl iodides, as evidenced by 55 successful examples yielding products in the 30&#8211;95&#8201;% range. Furthermore, our methodology surpasses conventional approaches by facilitating the one&#8208;pot selective diagonal diarylation of dianilides. This capability unlocks the construction of previously unattainable diagonal aryl systems, which serve as valuable precursors for the synthesis of diagonal tetraarylbenzenediamines and N&#8208;doped fulminenes, two crucial compound classes in materials science.

         <title>A Multistep Oxidative Cascade Reaction from a Naphthalenediol&#8208;Based Pre&#8208;Ligand to a Tetranuclear Perylenequinone&#8208;Based FeIII Complex</title>

Two 1,8&#8208;naphthalenediol&#8208;based ligands are coupled in a multistep oxidative cascade reaction to a tetranuclear perylenequinone&#8208;based FeIII complex involving an overall 10&#8208;electron oxidation. The assignment of the electronic structure of the new backbone is based on experimental data supported by DFT calculations.







Abstract
We have developed a family of dinuclear complexes using 2,7&#8208;disubstituted 1,8&#8208;naphthalenediol ligands that bind by molecular recognition to two neighboring phosphate diesters of the DNA backbone with the dinuclear CuII and NiII complexes exhibiting a severe cytotoxicity for human cancer cells. To increase the binding affinity, we intended to synthesize the corresponding dinuclear FeIII complex. Surprisingly, we obtained a tetranuclear FeIII perylene&#8208;based complex instead of the expected dinuclear FeIII naphthalene&#8208;based complex. In order to establish a rational and reproducible synthesis, we carefully analyzed this reaction. This revealed a multistep oxidative cascade reaction including the pre&#8208;coordination of FeII ions in the N3&#8208;binding pockets, the Lewis&#8208;acid assisted MOM&#8208;deprotection of the pre&#8208;ligand by the pre&#8208;oriented FeII ions, two oxidative aromatic C&#8722;C coupling reactions, oxidation of the perylene&#8208;based backbone and of FeII to FeIII. The careful analysis of bond lengths, HOMA indices (harmonic oscillation model of aromaticity), FTIR and UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR spectra supported by DFT calculations reveals the presence of an aromatic 18&#8208;electron oxidized perylenequinone ligand backbone. In summary, a multistep cascade reaction involving in total a 10&#8208;electron oxidation has been established for the straight&#8208;forward synthesis of an unprecedented perylenequinone&#8208;based ligand system.

         <title>A Chalcogenide&#8208;Derived NiFe2O4 as Highly Efficient and Stable Anode for Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a new strategy for reconstructing NiFe&#8208;based chalcogenides to highly efficient and alkali&#8208;stable NiFe2O4&#8208;based OER electrode (NiFeOx&#8208;350&#8208;Ov) for the anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer. Coupled with a non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based cathode, the resulting device displays energy efficiency and stability as high as the proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer.







Abstract
Developing low&#8208;cost, highly active, and durable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrodes is one of the critical scientific issues for anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEM&#8208;WE). Herein, we report a vacancy&#8208;rich and alkali&#8208;stable NiFe2O4&#8208;type electrode (named as NiFeOx&#8208;350&#8208;Ov), derived from the chemical&#8208;vapor deposited precursor NiFeSexSy&#8208;350, as an efficient and robust anode material. The obtained electrode affords current densities of 100 and 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at overpotentials of 245 and 270&#8197;mV, respectively, and displays excellent long&#8208;term durability sustaining 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at least for 1000&#8197;h. When coupled with Ni4Mo/MoO2/NF as a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst, the resulting platinum&#8208;group metal (PGM)&#8208;free single&#8208;cell AEM&#8208;WE exhibits a cell voltage of 1.71&#8197;V at the current density of 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 80&#8201;&#176;C and long&#8208;term durability during a current&#8208;cycling test between 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over 150&#8197;h at 60&#8201;&#176;C. This work highlights a unique reconstruction strategy for preparing highly active and durable OER catalysts used in PGM&#8208;free AEM&#8208;WE.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution from Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoelectrochemical properties and photocatalytic performance over hydrogen evoluation reaction of covalent organic frameworks can be significantly affected through molecular engineering of nitrogen sites by regulating the content and position of nitrogen atoms in the COFs. As a result, the optimal photocatalyst TpPpm with excellent capacities of charge transfer and electron&#8208;hole separation exhibits superior hydrogen production rates among all COFs.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have demonstrated significant potential as photocatalysts for efficiently generating hydrogen through photocatalytic water splitting. However, the design of COFs with distinct organic unit blocks at a molecular level profoundly influences their photocatalytic performance. In this study, we synthesized a series of &#946;&#8208;ketoamine COFs through molecular engineering of nitrogen sites, including phenyl&#8208;structured TpBD, phenylpyridine&#8208;structured TpPpy, phenylpyrimidine&#8208;structured TpPpm, and bipyridine&#8208;structured TpBpy. Advanced characterization techniques reveal that TpPpm and TpBpy with more nitrogen sites exhibit superior efficiencies in electron transfer and charge separation compared to TpBD and TpPpy, thereby endowing them with enhanced photocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution from water. As a result, the photocatalytic hydrogen production rates of TpPpm (33.80&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and TpBpy (29.18&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) surpass those of TpBD (20.82&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and TpPpy (27.49&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). Additionally, due to the different plane symmetries between Ppm and Bpy resulting from the various positions of nitrogen sites, TpPpm displays superior photochemical properties and better photocatalytic performance compared to TpBpy. Moreover, theoretical calculation results further confirm the exceptional intramolecular charge transfer ability of TpPpm among all COFs. This work underscores the significance of precisely controlling N sites in COFs for designing high&#8208;performance photocatalysts.

         <dc:description>Memantine hydrochloride, a non&#8208;competitive antagonist of NMDA&#8208;type glutamate receptors, is known to suppress the progression of symptoms in Alzheimer's disease. Possessing a characteristic adamantane skeleton as its core structure and an amino group at the bridgehead position, memantine was synthesized starting from acenaphthene. The synthesis involved nucleus hydrogenation of acenaphthene to perhydroacenaphthene, skeletal rearrangement of perhydroacenaphthene, nitration of 1,3&#8208;dimethyladamantane, and reduction of the nitro groups to an amino group. In each step, continuous flow reactions were investigated to achieve continuous manufacturing of memantine.</dc:description>

         <title>Role of Secondary Structure and Time&#8208;Dependent Binding on&#160;Disruption of Phthalocyanine Aggregates by Guanine&#8208;rich Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phthalocyanines are versatile photodynamic therapy agents whose biological activity depends on their aggregation state, which is expected to be influenced by binding to biomolecules. Here, guanine&#8208;rich nucleic acid binding of a water&#8208;soluble cationic, regiopure C4h zinc phthalocyanine bearing four triethylene glycol methyl ether and four N&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;pyridinium substituents (1) is reported. In contrast to double&#8208;stranded DNA, guanine systems GpG, (GG)10, poly(G) and quadruplex DNA are shown to effectively disrupt phthalocyanine aggregates in buffered solution. This process is accompanied by evolution of the Q&#8208;band absorbance and enhanced emission. Increasing the sequence length from GpG to (GG)10 increases the binding and confirms the importance of multiple binding interactions. Enhanced binding in the presence of KCl suggests the importance of nucleobase hydrogen&#8208;bonded mosaics in phthalocyanine binding. Notably, the (GT)10 sequence is even more effective than quadruplex and pure guanine systems at disrupting the aggregates of 1. Significant time&#8208;dependent binding of 1 with poly(G) reveals biexponential binding over minutes and hours, which is linked to local conformations of poly(G) that accommodate monomers of 1 over time. The study highlights the ability of biomacromolecules to disrupt phthalocyanines aggregates over time, which is an important consideration when rationalizing photoactivity of photosensitizers in&#8208;vivo.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Long&#8208;Awaited Aldehyde Intermediate in Oxidative Dephosphorylation: A Unique Approach to Access Useful Carboxaldehydes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidative dephosphorylation reactions usually generate symmetrically substituted alkenes from organophosphonates. Even the ubiquitous presence of oxygen can produce such alkenes inadvertently as a side product in small amounts from Wittig/ Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons (HWE) reactions. So far, aldehydes have been expected to be the on&#8208;pathway intermediate since their discovery, but there was no substantial experimental evidence to support this. Herein, aldehyde intermediates are judiciously trapped before forming alkene on dephosphorylation reactions of diverse phosphonates. Consequently, a unique synthetic strategy has been established to access structurally diverse aldehydes by oxidizing phosphonate carbanions using molecular oxygen. This is the first report to trap and isolate aldehydes since the historical discovery of Wittig/ HWE reactions. Only ketone/amide was isolated as a support, but no aldehyde. The optimization studies offer 48&#8208;84% reaction yields of such aldehydes. The mechanistic studies are validated with reaction mixture 1H and 31P&#8208;NMR studies. Along with other various aldehydes, a unique class of structurally diverse anthracenyl aldehydes exhibiting intense fluorescence has been identified. The extended process to bis&#8208;phosphonates led to bis&#8208;carboxaldehyde forming in 52&#8208;68% yield within 30 min. The scope is further extended to achieve 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole&#8208;linked phosphonate, functionalized with carboxaldehyde.</dc:description>

         <title>TiO2&#8208;Phase&#8208;Mediated Size Effect of Rh Nanoparticles on Photothermal Catalytic CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photothermal catalytic CO2 hydrogenation on TiO2&#8208;based catalysts has drawn extensive attention. However, few reports have focused on the impact of particle size of the active sites by altering TiO2 crystal phase on the CO2 hydrogenation activity. Herein, we successfully regulated Rh nanoparticle size by adjusting the crystal phases of TiO2 at different calcination temperatures and obtained impressive photothermal catalytic CO2 hydrogenation performance. Notably, the anatase&#8208;phase TiO2 loaded with Rh nanoparticles achieved a CH4 production rate of 2.7 mmol&#8729;h&#8722;1 with nearly 100% selectivity and a single&#8208;pass CO2 conversion rate of 69.4%. Given the anatase&#8208;phase TiO2 is more favorable for the presence of surface hydroxyl groups and oxygen vacancies, which can facilitate the distribution of Rh cations, Rh nanoparticles on the anatase&#8208;phase TiO2 exhibited the smallest sizes. Small Rh particle size further enhanced CO2 adsorption and activation, leading to high photothermal CO2 hydrogenation performance. Furthermore, the optimized Rh nanoparticle&#8208;loaded anatase&#8208;phase TiO2 catalyst exhibited high structural stability and resistance to coke accumulation, maintaining stability during long&#8208;term performance tests. This work investigated the particle size effect of active sites adjusted by crystal phase of light&#8208;harvesting materials on the photothermal catalytic performance, providing guidance for the preparation of effective catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to CH4.</dc:description>

Different levels of manipulation starting from the synthesis and processing also related to the tuning of the optical response (considering the peculiar combination of UV and NIR absorption with visible transparency) make these materials incredibly versatile.

         <title>Insights into the Solution Processing of Non&#8208;van der Waals Boron Carbide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exfoliation of non&#8208;layered materials is crucial to unleash their enormous potential in wide range of applications. However, the presence of strong non&#8208;van der Waals interactions in all three dimensions makes exfoliation challenging. Boron carbide (B4C), known for its high hardness, holds great potential for diverse applications. In this work, B4C is exfoliated in 29 solvents to determine its Hansen solubility parameters (HSP) and understand the dispersion stability. The experimentally determined HSP values are 19.6, 15.3 and 15.1 MPa1/2 for dispersive interactions (&#948;D), polar interactions (&#948;P) and hydrogen bonding interactions (&#948;H), respectively. Subsequently, in situ dispersion stability is analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively from the space&#8208;time resolved extinction profiles employing an analytical centrifuge. The sedimentation kinetics of B4C dispersions are analyzed using instability index, integral extinction and sedimentation velocity. B4C dispersions in solvents like &#949;&#8208;caprolactone, isopropyl alcohol, propylene carbonate and formamide exhibited excellent stability. Additionally, B4C nanosheets are utilized to investigate their field emission properties. These nanosheets exhibit a turn&#8208;on electric field of 3.35 V/&#956;m at an emission current density of 1 &#956;A cm&#8208;2, and it delivered a large emission current density of ~ 375 &#956;A cm&#8208;2 at an applied electric field of 5.7 V/&#956;m.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring ORR Activity in Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C Catalysts through Phosphorus Incorporation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts, doped with phosphorus, show improved ORR activity. Fe&#8208;NPC catalyst exhibits high metal loading, excellent ORR performance (onset potential of 1.00&#8197;V, half&#8208;wave potential of 0.864&#8197;V), and promising application in Zn&#8208;air batteries (758.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1Zn). DFT calculations reveal that phosphorus enhances O2 activation and reduces the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step.







Abstract
Atomically dispersed iron and nitrogen co&#8208;doped carbon materials (Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C) represent promising non&#8208;precious metal catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), offering potential alternatives to noble metal&#8208;based benchmarks. In our study, we investigated the influence of phosphorus doping on the catalytic activity of Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C. The experimental research demonstrate that the doping of phosphorus significantly enhances the ORR activity. Specifically, the resulting Fe&#8208;NPC exhibits high metal loading and excellent ORR activity in 0.1&#8197;M KOH with an onset potential of 1.00&#8197;V and a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.864&#8197;V. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations reveal that phosphorus improves the electrocatalytic activity by activating O2 molecules and reducing the energy barrier (the hydrogenation reaction *OH&#8594;H2O) of the rate&#8208;determining step. Furthermore, Fe&#8208;NPC exhibits promising application prospects as an air cathode in Zn&#8208;air batteries, delivering a high maximum discharge power density of 180.3&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and outstanding discharge specific capacity (758.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1Zn) at a discharge current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Synthesis of Polysubstituted Vinyl Sulfones by Direct C&#8722;S Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A process for the synthesis of polysubstituted vinylsulfones under mild conditions was developed to promote a selective, post&#8208;synthetic integration of molecular diversity, which should expedite the discovery of new medicines.







Abstract
Vinyl sulfones are valued for their unique chemical properties and bioactivity, but creating a wide range of different analogs remains a challenge. To address this limitation, we have developed a novel approach that facilitates the synthesis of polysubstituted vinyl sulfones. This method utilizes the dual functionality of NIS as a promoter that enables sulfonation and elimination in the synthesis of vinyl sulfones. We used the broad applicability, efficiency, selectivity, and functional group tolerance of this approach to synthesize more than 70 examples. Additionally, competition experiments have provided insights into the reactivity and selectivity of the transient sulfonyl radical towards various C&#8722;C multiple bonds. Herein, we describe using this mild protocol in the late&#8208;stage vinyl sulfonation of complex molecules to simplify the synthesis of specific targets and enable the modification of complex natural products and advanced materials.

         <title>Oxydiazomethylation of Alkenes via Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and modular approach for the direct 1,2&#8208;formyloxyl&#8208;diazomethylation of alkenes through visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis has been developed to assemble &#947;&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diazoesters.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Diazoesters belong to significantly important carbenoid precursors in synthetic chemistry. Diazomethylation&#8208;based difunctionalization of alkenes is highly valuable but remain nontrivial. Herein, we reported a general and modular approach for the direct 1,2&#8208;oxydiazomethylation of alkenes through visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis. This process exploits photocatalyzed strategy to convert alkenes to &#947;&#8208;formyloxyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diazoesters using &#945;&#8208;diazo iodonium salts as carbyne precursors, featuring wide substrate tolerance and broad late&#8208;stage diversifications. Mechanistic studies suggest that the formation of &#947;&#8208;carbocation&#8208;tethered &#945;&#8208;diazoesters plays a crucial role in trapping DMF and H2O to allow for this transformation.

The enantioselective intramolecular allylic dearomatization of allylic alcohol tethered &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;naphthols has been developed with iridium/acid&#8208; dual catalysis. A series of polycyclic spiroketones with vicinal tertiary and quaternary stereogenic centres were obtained in good to high yields with high diastereo&#8208; and moderate to high enantioselectivities.







Abstract
The first catalytic enantioselective intramolecular allylic dearomatization of allylic alcohol tethered &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;naphthols has been developed with iridium/acid&#8208;dual catalysis. A wide range of polycyclic spiroketones containing vicinal tertiary and quaternary carbon stereocenters were readily prepared in good to high yields with high diastereo&#8208; and moderate to excellent enantioselectivities. An unusual anti&#8208;Markovnikov Wacker oxidation has also been shown in synthetic transformations.

         <title>Regulating Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence of Organic Luminophores Through Stepwise Stabilization by Coordination and In&#8208;Situ Precipitation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dim and short&#8208;lived RTP emissive organic molecules were transferred into afterglow materials with an emission efficiency of 45&#8201;% and emission lifetime of 1.9&#8197;s, through a straightforward coordination and in&#8208;situ precipitation reaction. The coordination reaction reduced the energy gaps between singlet and triplet states and stabilized the excited states of the guest molecules.







Abstract
Developing efficiency and long&#8208;lived room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials through straightforward methods is highly desired. In this work, a stepwise stabilization strategy was proposed by the coordination and in&#8208;situ precipitation reactions among organic precursors, inorganic cation and anions, producing room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence materials with high emission efficiency (phosphorescence quantum yield of 45&#8201;%). Structural and photophysical characterizations revealed the coordination reaction reduced the energy gaps between singlet and triplet states and stabilized the excited states of the guest molecules. The in&#8208;situ precipitation reaction produced a solid matrix, which provided isolated environments for protecting the excitons from quenching. The applications of RTP materials in information encryption were demonstrated. The presented results provided a new clue for producing RTP materials, and extended their applications in wide fields.

         <title>Changes in Secondary Structure Upon Pr to Pfr Transition in Cyanobacterial Phytochrome Cph1 Detected by DNP NMR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phytochromes undergo structural changes upon light reception, involving a &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;to&#8208;helix transition for the canonical subgroup. We show this for the cyanobacterial phytochrome Cph1, that has a different sheet sequence than a previous example, by solid&#8208;state NMR under dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) conditions. An estimation of minimal helix length suggests conservation of the mechanism.







Abstract
Phytochromes perceive subtle changes in the light environment and convert them into biological signals by photoconversion between the red&#8208;light absorbing (Pr) and the far&#8208;red&#8208;absorbing (Pfr) states. In the primitive bacteriophytochromes this includes refolding of a tongue&#8208;like hairpin loop close to the chromophore, one strand of an antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet being replaced by an &#945;&#8208;helix. However, the strand sequence in the cyanobacterial phytochrome Cph1 is different from that of previously investigated bacteriophytochromes and has a higher &#946;&#8208;sheet propensity. We confirm here the transition experimentally and estimate minimum helix length using dynamic nuclear polarisation (DNP) magic angle spinning NMR. Sample conditions were optimized for protein DNP NMR studies at high field, yielding Boltzmann enhancements &#1013;B of 19 at an NMR field of 18.801&#8197;T. Selective labelling of Trp, Ile, Arg, and Val residues with 13C and 15N enabled filtering for pairs of labelled amino acids by the 3D CANCOCA technique to identify signals of the motif 483Ile&#8208;Val&#8208;Arg485 (IVR) present in both sheet and helix. Those signals were assigned for the Pfr state of the protein. Based on the chemical shift pattern, we confirm for Cph1 the formation of a helix covering the IVR motif.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinoxaline&#8208;based cyclometalated ruthenium complex&#8208;catalyzed selective oxidative scission of olefins to carbonyls is reported. Complex shows high catalytic activity and a long lifetime. Protocol is compatible with a wide range of substrate including biomass, natural products, sugar, amino acids, and fatty acid&#8208;derived compounds. The use of the by&#8208;product NaIO3 in the catalytic efficiency is disclosed for the first time.







Abstract
Oxidative cleavage of olefins is a useful reaction in organic synthesis. The most well&#8208;known catalytic system is the osmium based Lemieux&#8208;Johnson catalyst, which generally requires high catalyst loading and tends to suffer from rapid overoxidation to produce the acid predominantly. Hence, the development of a mild, general, and selective method toward the oxidative cleavage of alkenes to carbonyl compounds is highly desired. In this work, a highly efficient ruthenium&#8208;based catalyst for olefin oxidation has been demonstrated by employing a fused &#960;&#8208;conjugated imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinoxaline (ImQx) based NHC ligand with bidentate C(carbanion)&#8201;CNHC motif. Strong C&#8208;donor ligands, paired with a rigid backbone and ruthenium redox activity, provided exceptionally high catalytic activity and a long lifetime for olefin oxidation. Complex showed high catalytic activity and a long lifetime, TONs are several million. The catalyst tolerates numerous functional groups and can be applicable to challenging biomass, natural products, sugar, amino acids, and fatty acid&#8208;derived substrates. Based on kinetic studies, thermodynamic activation parameters, and DFT study, the mechanistic finding demonstrated that [3+2] cycloaddition reaction is the key step in the oxidation process. The use of the by&#8208;product NaIO3 in the catalytic efficiency has been disclosed for the first time.

         <title>Synthesis of Clickable Isotactic Poly(vinyl ether)s through Organocatalytic Stereoselective Cationic Copolymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly stereoselective cationic copolymerization of C&#8722;C triple bond&#8208;containing vinyl ethers with simple alkyl vinyl ethers has been successfully developed by employing confined Br&#248;nsted acid as catalyst. Subsequent post&#8208;modification of the clickable alkyne groups via thiol&#8208;yne click reactions or copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition reaction enables a modular access to isotactic polymers with various functional groups.







Abstract
By virtue of the high reliability of click chemistry, polymers with clickable groups provide a useful platform for the rapid synthesis of polymer materials with diverse functionalities and architectures. However, the polymerization of clickable vinyl monomers with a concurrent regulation on tacticity remains underdeveloped. Herein, we report the successful development of a stereoselective cationic copolymerization of C&#8722;C triple bond&#8208;containing vinyl ethers with simple alkyl vinyl ethers by employing confined Br&#248;nsted acid as catalyst, which allows for the synthesis of alkyne&#8208;functionalized vinyl ether copolymers with high isotacticity (up to 90&#8201;% m), controlled molecular weight, and variable content of C&#8722;C triple bonds. Further transformation of the pendant clickable alkyne groups via thiol&#8208;yne click reactions and copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition reaction enables a modular access to isotactic polymers with various functional groups.

         <title>Active Photonic Glass for Hydrogen Generation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article reports the fabrication of photonic glass with a chiral nematic structure using a simple sol&#8208;gel evaporation&#8208;induced cellulose nanocrystals self&#8208;assembly method. The glass exhibits variable iridescent colors over the UV&#8208;visible range. The chiral nematic structure provides the photoactive films the capability to improve the localized surface plasmon of Au and lead to improved photocatalytic H2 generation







Abstract
Chirality is vital in many living species since it is responsible for structural iridescent coloration and plays a key role in light harvesting during natural photosynthesis. Developing photoactive materials with such chiral structures is a challenging but promising strategy for energy applications. Here, we present a straightforward method to establish an active photonic glass obtained through the co&#8208;condensation of tetramethyl orthosilicate (TMOS) and titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (TAA) dissolved in a liquid crystal formed from cellulose nanocrystalline (CNC). The inorganic glass maintains a long range of chiral nematic ordering, displaying iridescent colors characterized by a Bragg peak reflection. The reflected wavelengths are tuned all over the UV&#8208;visible range, demonstrating that the replica of the chiral nematic structure generates photonic properties. Incorporation of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) into the films is further performed by impregnation/chemical reduction. We show that the charge carrier density and photocatalytic H2 generation were amplified when the photonic band gap edges matched the absorbance of the TiO2 and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of AuNPs. This photocatalytic glass with chiral nematic ordering and a tunable photonic bandgap paves the way for the development of metamaterials with new applications, such as asymmetric photocatalysis.

         <title>Bimetallic MIL&#8208;88/Polyaniline Hybrid Hollow Structure: In&#8208;situ Synthesis and Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Reaction at High Current Densities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a bimetallic iron&#8208;cobalt phytic acid complex loaded with polyaniline hollow structure (FCP@PAn) was constructed, via a progress of selective etching and surface modification in one step without high&#8208;temperature phosphating or carbonization. The FCP@PAn displayed high catalytic activity and stability at high current densities.







Abstract
Developing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts in an efficient strategy, while maintaining high catalytic activity and stability under high current densities, remains a crucial problem. In this study, a bimetallic iron&#8208;cobalt phytic acid complex loaded with polyaniline hollow structure (FCP@PAn) was successfully constructed, via a progress of selective etching and surface modification in one step without high&#8208;temperature phosphating or carbonization. The as&#8208;obtained FCP@PAn required only 329 and 385&#8197;mV overpotentials at high current densities of 500 and 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively, due to phytic acid and polyaniline incorporation and the coordinated effect of each component. Additionally, the FCP@PAn exhibited the lowest Tafel slope values of 44.6&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 and was able to continuously operate for 120&#8197;h at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, displaying high catalytic activity and stability. Hence, the hollow structure of the conductive polymer and MOFs composites provided a new surface modification strategy for transition metal&#8208;based catalysts that are prone to dissolution or corrosion during the OER process, as well as for high current density applications.

         <title>Remarkable Effect of Stereoisomerism on the Am(III)/Ln(III) Solvent Extraction. New Ligands for Highly Efficient Separation of Americium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DAPhen ligands with chiral carbon atoms in amide substituents selectively extract Am(III) from strongly acidic media reaching SFAm(III)/La(III) values of 140. DAm(III) is nearly an order of magnitude higher for individual meso&#8208;forms. An abrupt increase in extraction efficiency from La(III) to Lu(III) is a result of formation of unusual L2M2 or even L4M5 ionic complexes of heavy lanthanides.







Abstract
Two novel 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline&#8208;2,9&#8208;diamide ligands were constructed on the basis of 2&#8208;phenylpyrrolidine and obtained as pure diastereomers. These ligands demonstrated advanced properties in liquid&#8208;liquid extraction tests. They revealed high efficiency of americium(III) extraction alongside with the record values of selectivity in the separation of americium from light lanthanides from strongly acidic media. An abrupt increase of extraction efficiency when moving along the lanthanide series from lanthanum to lutetium was observed. The examination of the extraction behavior of pure diastereomeric forms revealed noticeable differences in their selectivity while maintaining the overall extraction trend. The explanation of the discovered patterns was elucidated by a comprehensive study of the ability of the ligands to bind lanthanide nitrates in solutions. All the data collected (UV&#8208;vis and NMR titration, X&#8208;ray analysis of resulting complexes, solvation numbers estimation) were supported by quantum chemical calculation. These data clearly indicated that in the case of light lanthanides the formation of 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complexes is most preferable. At the same time, complexes with heavy lanthanides, such as ytterbium and lutetium, exist as ionic pairs which may consist of [L2M]z+ cations counterbalanced by metallate anions, which may result in the formation of the species of unusual composition like L2M2 or even L4M5 clusters.

At the same time, complexes with heavy lanthanides, such as ytterbium and lutetium, exist as ionic pairs which may consist of [L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;M]&lt;sup&gt;z+&lt;/sup&gt; cations counterbalanced by metallate anions, which may result in the formation of the species of unusual composition like L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or even L&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; clusters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bispecific Thio&#8208;Linked Disaccharides as Inhibitors of Pseudomonas Aeruginosa Lectins LecA (PA&#8208;IL) and LecB (PA&#8208;IIL): Dual&#8208;Targeting Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a major pathogen linked to cystic fibrosis, relies on the virulence factors, lectins LecA and LecB, responsible for the cytotoxicity and adhesion to host cells. As inhibitors of these lectins, thiodisaccharides were synthesized including bispecific compounds targeting both lectins. Their inhibitory potential was confirmed, and structural insights were gained from ligand&#8208;lectin interactions.







Abstract
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a prevalent opportunistic human pathogen, particularly associated with cystic fibrosis. Among its virulence factors are the LecA and LecB lectins. Both lectins play an important role in the adhesion to the host cells and display cytotoxic activity. In this study, we successfully synthesized hardly hydrolysable carbohydrate ligands targeting these pathogenic lectins, including two bispecific glycans. The interactions between LecA/LecB lectins and synthetic glycans were evaluated using hemagglutination (yeast agglutination) inhibition assays, comparing their efficacy with corresponding monosaccharides. Additionally, the binding affinities of bispecific glycans were assessed using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Structural insight into the lectin&#8208;ligand interaction was obtained by determining the crystal structures of LecA/LecB lectins in complex with one of the bispecific ligands using X ray crystallography. This comprehensive investigation into the inhibitory potential of synthetic glycosides against P. aeruginosa lectins sheds light on their potential application in antimicrobial therapy.

         <title>Evolution Enhances Kemp Eliminase Activity by Optimizing Oxyanion Stabilization and Conformational Flexibility</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The HG3&#8208;to&#8208;HG3.17 evolutionary pathway enhances Kemp eliminase activity by refining active&#8208;site interactions and enhancing conformational dynamics. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that a water&#8208;mediated network of non&#8208;covalent interactions supports a catalytically competent conformation. Gln50 contributes to oxyanion stabilization, while Trp44 regulates Gln50 flexibility, influencing active&#8208;site preorganization and catalytic efficiency for the most evolved variant HG3.17.







Abstract
The base&#8208;promoted Kemp elimination reaction has been used as a model system for enzyme design. Among the multiple computationally designed and evolved Kemp eliminases generated along the years, the HG3&#8208;to&#8208;HG3.17 evolutionary trajectory is particularly interesting due to the high catalytic efficiency of HG3.17 and the debated role of glutamine 50 (Gln50) as potential oxyanion stabilizer. This study aims to elucidate the structural and dynamic changes along the evolutionary pathway from HG3 to HG3.17 that contribute to improved catalytic efficiency. In particular, we evaluate key variants along the HG3 evolutionary trajectory via molecular dynamics simulations coupled to non&#8208;covalent interactions and water analysis. Our computational study indicates that HG3.17 can adopt a catalytically competent conformation promoted by a water&#8208;mediated network of non&#8208;covalent interactions, in which aspartate 127 (Asp127) is properly positioned for proton abstraction and Gln50 and to some extent mutation cysteine 84 (Cys84) contribute to oxyanion stabilization. We find that HG3.17 exhibits a rather high flexibility of Gln50, which is regulated by the conformation adopted by the active site residue tryptophan 44 (Trp44). This interplay between Gln50 and Trp44 positioning induced by distal active site mutations affects the water&#8208;mediated network of non&#8208;covalent interactions, Gln50 preorganization, and water content of the active site pocket.

         <title>Stepwise Construction of Supramolecular A2B4&#8208;Type Miktoarm Star Copolymers with a Cobalt Phthalocyanine Core</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;ligand coordination has been used to generate a supramolecular miktoarm star&#8208;shaped copolymer with a cobalt(II) phthalocyanine (CoPc) core. Stepwise axial coordination of the terminal pyridyl group of poly(methyl methacrylate) to the CoPc core of the four&#8208;armed, star&#8208;shaped polystyrene provided AB4&#8208; and A2B4&#8208;type microstars.







Abstract
Supramolecular interactions between polymers play a crucial role in the construction of three&#8208;dimensional polymer structures with unique physical and chemical properties. In this study, we have fabricated a novel supramolecular miktoarm star copolymer (&#956;&#8208;star) with a cobalt(II) phthalocyanine (CoPc) core using metal&#8208;ligand coordination. Axial coordination of the terminal pyridyl group of poly(methyl methacrylate) with the CoPc core of four&#8208;armed star&#8208;shaped polystyrene provided AB4&#8208; and A2B4&#8208;type &#956;&#8208;stars through stepwise complexation. The spin&#8208;coated polymer films from mixed solutions of CoPcPS4 and pyPMMA in 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 or 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 mass ratios exhibited phase&#8208;separated nanodomains with smooth surfaces. Supramolecular interactions in polymer systems provide a unique topology to polymers and affect their bulk morphology.

TADF: Heavy&#8208;Atom Effect Does Not Always Enhance rISC: We prepared compact orthogonal electron donor/acceptor dyads. The delayed fluorescence lifetime and triplet state lifetime of compounds containing heavy atoms are longer than the heavy atom&#8208;free counterparts, suggesting that the heavy atom effect on the rISC is not straightforward. The simultaneous observation of the presence of LE and CS triplet states in the TREPR spectra is the experimental evidence for the spin&#8208;vibronic coupling mechanism for TADF.







Abstract
We prepared thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitter dyads, NI&#8208;PTZ, NI&#8208;PTZ&#8208;2Br and NI&#8208;PSeZ, with naphthalimide (NI) as electron acceptor and 10H&#8208;phenothiazine (PTZ) or 10H&#8208;phenoselenazine (PSeZ) as electron donor to study the heavy&#8208;atom effect on the intersystem crossing (ISC) and reverse ISC (rISC) in the TADF emitters. The delayed fluorescence lifetimes of the dyads containing heavy atoms (

Nanosecond transient absorption (ns&#8208;TA) spectral study and the time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectra show the presence of both 3LE and 3CS states. These findings represent solid experimental evidences for the spin&#8208;vibronic coupling mechanism of TADF. Moreover, the ns&#8208;TA spectra show that the heavy atoms don't have a significant effect since the lifetime of the triplet transient species (1.3&#8197;&#956;s for NI&#8208;PTZ) is not shortened in their presence (4.5&#8197;&#956;s for NI&#8208;PSeZ and 5.3&#8197;&#956;s for NI&#8208;PTZ&#8208;2Br). These results show that the previously claimed heavy&#8208;atom effect on rISC and TADF is not a universal principle.

         <title>Engineering Metal&#8208;MOF Interfaces for Selective CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol is a promising pathway toward sustainable fuel production and carbon recycling. A key factor in the efficiency of this process lies in the interaction between the metal catalyst and its support. Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as highly effective platforms due to their tunable structures, large surface areas, and ability to form stable interfaces with single&#8211;atom metals or metal nanoparticles. These metal&#8208;MOF interfaces are crucial for stabilizing active sites, preventing sintering, and enhancing catalytic performance. In this concept paper, we explore the role of these interfaces in promoting CO2 hydrogenation, focusing on Cu&#8208;Zn, Cu&#8208;Zr, and Zn&#8208;Zr interfaces. The formation of strong interactions between metal sites and MOF nodes enables precise control over the dispersion and electronic environment of the active species, significantly improving methanol selectivity and long&#8208;term stability. By analyzing recent advancements in MOF&#8208;supported catalysts, this work highlights the concept of engineered metal&#8208;MOF interfaces to drive the development of next&#8208;generation catalysts for efficient methanol synthesis from CO2.</dc:description>

         <title>Dispersion Forces&#8208;Driven Hierarchical Assembly of Protein&#8208;Like Lanthanide Octamers and Emergent CPL</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hierarchical self&#8208;assembly driven by non&#8208;covalent interactions is a prevalent strategy employed by nature to construct sophisticated biomacromolecules, such as proteins. However, the construction of protein&#8208;like superstructures that rely on weaker dispersion forces&#8208;driven hierarchical assembly remains largely unexplored. Here, we report the first example of dispersion forces driving the high&#8208;order assembly of the lanthanide trinuclear circular helicate [HNEt&#8323;]&#8323;[Eu&#8323;(LL)&#8326;] (&#916;&#916;&#916;&#8208;1) into a protein&#8208;like lanthanide octamer ((&#916;&#916;&#916;&#8208;1)&#8328;&#8208;2). Within the octamer, the forty&#8208;eight (48) menthol groups on the ligands and eighty&#8208;four (84) 1,4&#8208;dioxane solvent molecules contribute to enhanced dispersion forces through conformational adaptation and size&#8208;matching effects. These enhanced dispersion forces not only drive the formation of the hierarchical superstructure but also result in a four&#8208;level chirality transfer from the menthol to the octamer. Benefiting from the homochirality of Eu&#179;&#8314;, the octamer is endowed the strong circularly polarized emission (|glum| = 0.34, &#934;overall = 41%). This understanding of how dispersion forces drive hierarchical self&#8208;assembly provides a foundation for the directed fabrication of more fascinating superstructures.</dc:description>

         <title>Critical Evaluation of Childs Method for the NMR Spectroscopic Scaling of Effective Lewis Acidity: Limitations and Resolution of Earlier Discrepancies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantifying Lewis acidity is essential for understanding and optimizing the performance of Lewis acids in diverse applications. Next to the widely accepted Gutmann&#8208;Beckett (GB) method, using triethyl phosphine oxide (TEPO) as a probe, the Childs method&#8212;employing trans&#8208;crotonaldehyde (TCA)&#8212;gained attention as an NMR&#8208;based technique for measuring effective Lewis acidity (eLA). Despite its steady use, the robustness of Childs method and its correlation with other measures remain underexplored. Previous comparisons between the GB and Childs scales revealed significant discrepancies, suggesting that hard and soft acid/base (HSAB) characteristics may be operative. In this study, we compare thermodynamic data for TCA binding to 117 Lewis acids (representing global Lewis acidity, gLA) with their corresponding NMR&#8208;induced chemical shifts in TCA. Our findings showcase notable deviations that reinforce key distinctions between eLA and gLA perspectives. Moreover, we identify significant limitations in the Childs method. First, the weak donor strength of TCA limits its applicability to only the strongest Lewis acids. Second, the exposed protons of TCA are prone to secondary interactions, obscuring the measurement of true Lewis acidity. Finally, our analysis reconciles discrepancies, refuting earlier assumptions that these arise from HSAB effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed O&#8208;Arylation of N&#8208;Protected Amino Alcohols with (Hetero)aryl Chlorides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The aryloxyamine motif is a prominent pharmacophore in drug design and development. While these biologically relevant structures could in principle be sustainably assembled from the base metal&#8208;catalyzed O&#8208;arylation of inexpensive and abundant amino alcohols with (hetero)aryl chlorides, reports of such challenging C&#8211;O bond formations with useful scope are lacking. In response, we report herein the hitherto unknown Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;O cross&#8208;coupling of N&#8208;protected amino alcohols (primary, secondary, and tertiary) with (hetero)aryl chlorides. Also presented are chemoselective sequential/telescoped C&#8211;N and C&#8211;O cross&#8208;couplings of the unprotected amino alcohol prolinol to afford an unsymmetrical diarylated product.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of a Perfluorinated Amphiphilic Cyanine Dye into Branched Tubular J&#8208;Aggregates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The self&#8208;assembly process is governed by the individual constituents of molecules through precise non&#8208;covalent interactions. Amphiphilic cyanines are intriguing in supramolecular chemistry due to the large polarizability of their delocalized &#960;&#8211;electron systems, their tuneable optical properties and their ability to form well&#8208;defined self&#8208;assembled structures in different media. Here we present the synthesis of a novel tetrahydroxy amphiphilic carbocyanine dye with perfluoro alkylated chains &#8208;(CH2)2&#8208;(CF2)5&#8208;CF3 as hydrophobic segments and aminoproanediol as hydrophilic segment. The target molecule was synthesized in a multi&#8208;step process, which illustrates the complexity and precision required to achieve the desired structure. This study focuses on the comparison of the influence of C8H17 and C8H4F13 tails and the effects of carboxylated and non&#8208;ionic aminopropanediol head groups as substituents on self&#8208;assembly of the TBC dye. Absorption and fluorescence measurements show similar spectroscopic properties to cyanine dyes studied previously. Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;TEM) reveals formation of multiple supramolecular aggregates. As supramolecular assembly is very sensitive to sample preparation, multilamellar or multivesicular vesicles are obtained preferentially in vigorously vortexed solutions. Moreover, time&#8208;dependent tube formation was observed in gently mixed solutions. Thereby, we could follow the growing mechanism of the unprecedented Y&#8208;junctions of supramolecular tubes.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Bis(diimino)palladium Nanosheets as Highly Active Electrocatalysts for Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) is necessary to achieve environmentally friendly and sustainable hydrogen production. To reduce cost and to circumvent the scarcity of platinum, the most efficient catalyst for HER, it is essential to develop catalysts using ubiquitous base metals or minimal amounts of precious noble metals. Bis(diimino)metal (MDI) coordination nanosheets are potential HER catalysts because their electric conductivities, two&#8208;dimensionality, and porous structures provide large surface areas and efficient mass and electron transfer. In addition, with sparse metal arrangements in their chemical structures, nanosheets can reduce the amount of metal needed. We synthesized bis(diimino)palladium coordination nanosheets (PdDI) as a coordination polymer composed of bis(diimino)palladium, with semiconducting characteristics, using gas&#8208;liquid interfacial synthesis and electrochemical oxidation. These electrochemically synthesized PdDIs exhibit remarkable catalytic performance with overpotential reaching 10 mA cm&#8722;2 of 34 mV, a Tafel slope of 47 mV dec&#8722;1, and an exchange current density of 2.1 mA cm&#8722;2 after appropriate activation. This performance is closely comparable to that of metallic platinum. An ex&#8208;situ investigation of the activation process revealed that reduction of the divalent Pd center in bis(diimino)palladium produced a composite of Pd(0) species and PdDI, combining high catalytic activity with smooth electron transfer.</dc:description>

Four shades of pastel: The synthesis, reactivity and in&#8208;depth characterisation of cationic group 15 carbene analogues is reported.







Abstract
The synthesis, characterization and reactivity of the diferrocenylphosphenium ion [Fc2P]+ was extended to the heavier diferrocenylpnictogenium ions, [Fc2E]+ (E=As, Sb, Bi). The lighter diferrocenylnitrenium ion, [Fc2N]+, was detected by mass spectrometry, but could not be isolated. The molecular structures of [Fc2E]+ (E=P, As, Sb, Bi) reveal intramolecular coordination of the iron atoms, which counterbalance the electron deficiency of the pnictogens without affecting the strong Lewis acidities, which were determined according to the method of Gutmann and Beckett. The (electro&#8722;)chemical oxidation and reduction afforded the dications [Fc2E]2+ (E=P (unstable), As) and the neutral dipnictogens Fc2EEFc2 (E=P, As).

         <title>&#960;&#8208;mers and &#960;&#8208;dimers: Two Radical Supramolecular Interactions &#8211; A Tutorial Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;mers and &#960;&#8208;dimers are two radical interactions being easily confused on account of their similarities. This tutorial review introduces i) a clear definition of each interaction, ii) their main physico&#8208;chemical differences observable by major analytical techniques (X&#8208;Ray, UV/Vis/NIR, EPR, NMR and electrochemistry), iii) some of their thermodynamic features, and iii) examples showing strategies to enhance their stability (using a covalent spacer, a confined environment and mechanical bonds).







Abstract
In this review, the difference between &#960;&#8208;mers (pimers) and &#960;&#8208;dimers (pi&#8208;dimers) will be discussed. Often interchanged or confused in the literature, these two radical interactions lead to different or even opposite physico&#8208;chemical behaviors. This review aims at clarifying the terms &#960;&#8208;mers and &#960;&#8208;dimers and at describing their main physico&#8208;chemical properties to address their differences. Finally, selected literature examples exhibiting the successive formation of &#960;&#8208;mers and &#960;&#8208;dimers within the same systems will be detailed to emphasize the physico&#8208;chemical changes occurring upon conversion.

         <title>Organocatalytic Electrophilic Arene Amination: Rapid Synthesis of 2&#8208;Quinolones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fresh approach to 2&#8208;quinolone synthesis! This study presents an innovative organocatalytic electrophilic arene amination strategy, enabling the efficient synthesis of a diverse array of 2&#8208;quinolones &#8211; a critical scaffold with extensive industrial applications. By circumventing traditional metal&#8208;based catalysts, this approach paves the way for advancements in multiple sectors, offering a sustainable and versatile alternative.







Abstract
For decades, the synthesis of 2&#8208;quinolones, a crucial structural motif in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, has relied heavily on costly noble metal complexes and structurally complex ligands. Despite considerable efforts from synthetic chemists, a mild, metal&#8208;free, environmentally friendly, and cost&#8208;effective approach has remained elusive. This study introduces a robust, metal&#8208;free synthetic platform that leverages an innovative organoiodine&#8208;catalyzed electrophilic arene C(sp2)&#8722;H amination strategy to efficiently produce a wide range of new and modifiable 2&#8208;quinolones. Moreover, this study allows ready synthetic access to novel 8&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;quinolones, uncovering new chemical spaces with significant potential for medicinal applications.

         <title>A Novel Methacryloyl&#8211;Masked NIR Fluorescent Probe for Detection of Cysteine and Its Application in Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the NIR fluorescent probe SNC&#8208;Cys that allows Cys detection. It is a highly sensitive and selective fluorescent probe that detects Cys based on the ICT photo mechanism. The probe works through Michael addition. SNC&#8208;Cys was successfully employed in the endogenous and exogenous imaging of Cys in living cells with good cell permeability.







Abstract
Cysteine (Cys) detection is recognized as an essential element in this investigation due to the critical function of Cys in several physiological processes in living organisms. A new NIR fluorescent probe SNC&#8211;Cys has been synthesized by incorporating a five&#8208;membered malononitrile derivatized ring as an electron withdrawing group, and a methacryloyl group detection moiety for cysteine. After adding Cys, SNC&#8211;Cys shows an emission of 654&#8197;nm and further works as a &#8220;Turn&#8211;on&#8221; probe via ICT photomechanism. SNC&#8211;Cys has high sensitivity and selectivity for Cys (LOD=0.46&#8197;&#956;M) and can discriminate it from other closely related amino acids, molecules with structural similarity, and in some cases very close functional group likeness. Thus, these results allow the effective imaging of Cys in living A549 cells which indicates good cell permeability and high applicability in live cell imaging. This study anticipates that SNC&#8211;Cys could be an aid in the detection of Cys&#8211;relevant diseases.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Coreactants Enhanced Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One plus one is greater than two: A remarkable electrochemiluminescence (ECL) enhancement of Ru(bpy)32+/TPrA is observed by introducing another coreactant, TEOA, with a 10.8&#8208;fold increase of ECL intensity and 1.7&#8208;fold extension of ECL layer. The enhancement was interpreted by a chemical oxidation route, in which TEOA+&#8901; acts as an enhancer to produce more TPrA+&#8901; and meanwhile allow the remote formation of TPrA+&#8901;. This dual&#8208;coreactants strategy works not only in solution with freely diffusive Ru(bpy)32+ but also on Ru(bpy)32+&#8208;functionalized microbeads, showing promise in ECL&#8208;based bioassay and microscopy.







Abstract
The electrochemiluminescence (ECL) of ruthenium(II) tris(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl) (Ru(bpy)32+) with tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine (TPrA) as the good coreactant can be unexpectedly enhanced by a weak coreactant, such as triethanolamine (TEOA). First, the intensity of ECL emitted by Ru(bpy)32+/TPrA can be remarkably amplified by 10.8&#8208;fold after adding some amount of TEOA. Moreover, the ECL layer thickness, measured by self&#8208;interference spectroscopy, is also doubled. The enhancement far exceeding the superposition of respective contribution of TPrA and TEOA was elucidated by a &#8220;chemical oxidation mechanism&#8221;, in which TEOA+&#8901; acts as a chemical enhancer to oxidize TPrA in solution and to accelerate significantly the ECL reaction kinetics. This mechanism was proved by single&#8208;photon counting experiment and finite element simulations. In addition, the dual&#8208;coreactants strategy works well not only in solution with freely diffusive Ru(bpy)32+, but also on Ru(bpy)32+&#8208;functionalized microbeads, suggesting that ethanolamines could act as cheap, easily available and low&#8208;background enhancers for ECL&#8208;based bioanalysis and microscopy.

         <title>Cyclometalated IrIII Complex Possessing Chiral MIC ligand: Regiospecific sp3 C&#8211;H Activation and Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation of Ketone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclometalation offers a wide number of organometallic metallacycles showing diverse applications. However, such NHC complexes synthesized via an sp3 C&#8211;H bond activation are rare. An iridium(III) complex with a chiral mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (MIC) ligand, where the IrIII forms an additional Ir&#8211;C bond via a regiospecific sp3 C&#8211;H bond activation at the N&#8208;methylbenzyl wingtip, was synthesized and characterized. To our best knowledge, this represents the first example of cyclometalated iridium(III) complex possessing a chiral MIC donor ligand. The formation of the complex was followed by 2D correlation NMR spectroscopy and the molecular formula mass was evidenced by ESI&#8208;HRMS mass spectrometry. The molecular structure of the IrIII&#8208;MIC complex was unambiguously established by the single crystal XRD data. This cyclometalated IrIII complex was employed in the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of 4&#8208;bromoacetophenone, and the complex was successful to transfer chirality to the final alcohol molecules (up to 92% ee).</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable Bulk Synthesis of Phase&#8208;Pure &#947;&#8208;Sn3N4 as a Model for an Argon&#8208;Flow&#8208;Mediated Metathesis Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phase&#8208;pure, crystalline &#947;&#8208;Sn3N4 was synthesized via reaction of argon&#8208;diluted SnCl4 with Mg3N2. The exothermic nature of the reaction is controlled by slow mixing of the starting materials with a continuous flow of argon. The reaction can be further facilitated by the use of a tin flux. This new method not only leads to pure &#947;&#8208;Sn3N4 material, but is also promising for the synthesis of other nitride materials.







Abstract
Nitrides represent a promising class of materials for a variety of applications. However, bulk synthesis remains a challenging task due to the stability of the N2 molecule. In this study, we introduce a simple and scalable approach for synthesizing nitride bulk materials. Moderate reaction temperatures are achieved by using reactive starting materials, slow and continuous mixing of the starting materials, and by dissipating heat generated during the reaction. The impact on the synthesis of using different starting materials as nitrogen source and the influence of a flux were examined. &#947;&#8208;Sn3N4 was selected as the model compound. The synthesis of pure &#947;&#8208;Sn3N4 bulk material on a large scale has still been a challenge, although a few synthesis methods were already described in the literature. Here we synthesized &#947;&#8208;Sn3N4 by metathesis reaction of argon&#8208;diluted SnCl4 with Li3N, Mg3N2 or Ca3N2 as nitrogen sources. Products were characterized by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, dynamic flash combustion analysis, hot gas extraction analysis, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption and emission spectroscopy. Additionally, single&#8208;crystal diffraction data of &#947;&#8208;Sn&#8323;N&#8324;, previously unavailable, were successfully collected.

         <title>Advances in Pyridine C &#8211; H Functionalizations: Beyond C2 Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pyridine core is a crucial component in numerous FDA&#8208;approved drugs and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulated agrochemicals. It also plays a significant role in ligands for transition metals, alkaloids, catalysts, and various organic materials with diverse properties, making it one of the most important structural frameworks. However, despite its significance, direct and selective functionalization of pyridine is still relatively underdeveloped due to its electron&#8208;deficient nature and the strong coordinating ability of nitrogen. Among the variety of synthetic transformation, direct functionalization of C&#8208;H bond is straightforward and atom economical approach and it&#8217;s advantageous for late&#8208;stage functionalization of pyridine containing drugs. In recent years, innovative strategies for regioselective C&#8208;H functionalization of pyridines and azines have emerged, offering numerous benefits such as high regioselectivity, mild conditions, and enabling transformations that were challenging with traditional methods. This review emphasizes the latest advancements in meta and para&#8208;C&#8208;H functionalization of pyridines through various approaches, including pyridine phosphonium salts, photocatalytic methods, temporary de&#8208;aromatization, Minisci&#8208;type reactions, and transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H activation techniques. We discuss the advantages and limitations of these current methods and aim to inspire further progress in this significant field.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Strategies for Enhancing the Multifunctionality of Smart Dynamic Molecular Crystal Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic molecular crystals are an emerging class of smart engineering materials that possess unique ability to convert external energy into mechanical motion. Moreover, they have being considered as strong candidates for dynamic elements in applications such as flexible electronic devices, artificial muscles, sensors, and soft robots. However, the inherent defects of molecular crystals like brittleness, short&#8208;life and fatigue, have significantly impeded their practical applications. Inspired by the concept of "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts" in the field of biology, building stimuli&#8208;response composites materials can be regarded as one of the ways to break through the current limitations of dynamic molecular crystals. Moreover, the hybrid materials can exhibit new functionalities that cannot be achieved by a single object. In this review, the focus was placed on the analysis and discussion of various hybrid strategies and options, as well as the functionalities of hybrid dynamic molecular crystal materials and the important practical applications of composite materials, with the introduction of photomechanical molecular crystals and flexible molecular crystals as a starting point.&#160;Moreover, the efficiency, limitations, and advantages of different hybrid methods were compared and discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling the Mechanism of Stereospecific Self&#8208;promoted N&#8208;Glycosylations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, the mechanism of selfpromoted
N&#8208;glycosylations is extensively investigated
through kinetic experiments, computational studies, and
nucleophilic competition experiments. Based on the findings,
the mechanism is proposed to be initiated by proton
transfer from the acidic sulfonyl carbamate to the
trichloroacetimidate, upon formation of an associated contact
ion pair. This ion pair then collapses in an SN1&#8208;like
fashion, with formation of an oxocarbeniumion&#8208;like intermediate.
According to the proposed mechanism, stereospecificity
arises from the associated nature of all intermediates
formed throughout the reaction. During the
mechanistic study, it was also found that the sulfonyl carbamates
have catalytic properties if a competing nucleophile
is present.</dc:description>
