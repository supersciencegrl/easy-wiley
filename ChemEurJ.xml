         <title>Non&#8208;Heme&#8208;Iron&#8208;Mediated Selective Halogenation of Unactivated Carbon&#8722;Hydrogen Bonds</title>

Slowly, but surely: The iron(IV)&#8208;oxido complex [(L1)(Cl)FeIV=O]+ with a chloride in cis position to the oxido group is an excellent model for non&#8208;heme&#8208;iron halogenases: it activates the very strong C&#8722;H bonds of cyclohexane and selectively leads to the halogenated product. Although it is the fastest iron(IV)&#8208;oxido model system known, formation of an oxido&#8208;bridged diiron(III) resting is the dominating reaction, and the halogenation itself therefore is a relatively slow but still selective process.







Abstract
Oxidation of the iron(II) precursor [(L1)FeIICl2], where L1 is a tetradentate bispidine, with soluble iodosylbenzene (sPhIO) leads to the extremely reactive ferryl oxidant [(L1)(Cl)FeIV=O]+ with a cis disposition of the chlorido and oxido coligands, as observed in non&#8208;heme halogenase enzymes. Experimental data indicate that, with cyclohexane as substrate, there is selective formation of chlorocyclohexane, the halogenation being initiated by C&#8722;H abstraction and the result of a rebound of the ensuing radical to an iron&#8208;bound Cl&#8722;. The time&#8208;resolved formation of the halogenation product indicates that this primarily results from sPhIO oxidation of an initially formed oxido&#8208;bridged diiron(III) resting state. The high yield of up to &gt;70&#8201;% (stoichiometric reaction) as well as the differing reactivities of free Fe2+ and Fe3+ in comparison with [(L1)FeIICl2] indicate a high complex stability of the bispidine&#8208;iron complexes. DFT analysis shows that, due to a large driving force and small triplet&#8208;quintet gap, [(L1)(Cl)FeIV=O]+ is the most reactive small&#8208;molecule halogenase model, that the FeIII/radical rebound intermediate has a relatively long lifetime (as supported by experimentally observed cage escape), and that this intermediate has, as observed experimentally, a lower energy barrier to the halogenation than the hydroxylation product; this is shown to primarily be due to steric effects.

         <title>Electronic Circular Dichroism Imaging (ECDi) Casts a New Light on the Origin of Solid&#8208;State Chiroptical Properties</title>

It depends how you look at it: By exploring randomly formed domains of microcrystalline finasteride dispersed in a KCl pellet with the spatial resolution of 0.1&#8197;mm granted by synchrotron source, we noticed that anisotropic ECDi (ACD) spectra might be very different from the emergent solid&#8208;state ECD spectrum recorded on a commercial instrument, which is similar to the solution ECD. Consequently, we got an exclusive insight into the critical role played by local domains.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state ECD (ss&#8208;ECD) spectra of a model microcrystalline solid, finasteride, dispersed into a KCl pellet were recorded by using the synchrotron radiation source at the Diamond B23 beamline. Scanning a surface of 36&#8197;mm2 with a step of 0.5&#8197;mm, we measured a set of ECD imaging (ECDi) spectra very different from each other and from the ss&#8208;ECD recorded with a bench&#8208;top instrument (1&#8197;cm2 area). This is due to the anisotropic part of the ECD (ACD), which averages to zero in solution or on a large number of randomly oriented crystallites, but can otherwise be extremely large. Two&#8208;way singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis, through experimental and simulated TDDFT spectra, disclosed that the measured and theoretical principal components are in line with each other. This finding demonstrates that the observed isotropic ss&#8208;ECD spectrum is governed by the anisotropy of locally oriented crystals. It also introduces a new quality for ss&#8208;ECD measurements and opens a new future for probing and mapping chiral materials in the solid state such as active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).

         <title>Rational Design and Facile Synthesis of Dual&#8208;State Emission Fluorophores: Expanding Functionality for the Sensitive Detection of Nitroaromatic Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 4, January 19, 2022. </description>

Novel benzimidazole&#8208;based D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A fluorophores are rationally designed and concisely synthesized. Six compounds 4&#8201;a&#8211;4&#8201;f, as dual&#8208;state emission (DSE) materials, exhibit excellent photostability, solvatofluorochromic and extraordinary wide range of solvent compatibility. Among them, the DSE material 4&#8201;a is not only reasonably developed as a multifunctional fluorescent probe for sensitive detection of nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) in aqueous system, but also processed into test strips and thin films for visual detection of NACs.







Abstract
Six novel benzimidazole&#8208;based D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A compounds 4&#8201;a&#8211;4&#8201;f were concisely synthesized by attaching different donor/acceptor units to the skeleton of 1,3&#8208;bis(1H&#8208;benzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzene on its 5&#8208;position through an ethynyl link. Due to the twisted conformation and effective conjugation structure, these dual&#8208;state emission (DSE) molecules show intense and multifarious photoluminescence, and their fluorescence quantum yields in solution and solid state can be up to 96.16 and 69.82&#8201;%, respectively. Especially, for excellent photostability, obvious solvatofluorochromic and extraordinary wide range of solvent compatibility, DSE molecule 4&#8201;a is a multifunctional fluorescent probe for the visual detection of nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) with the limit of detection as low as 10&#8722;7 M. The quenching mechanism has been proved as the results of photoinduced electron transfer and fluorescence resonance energy transfer processes. Importantly, probe 4&#8201;a can sensitively detect NACs not only in real water samples, but also on 4&#8201;a&#8208;coated strips and 4&#8201;a@PBAT thin films.

         <title>An Isolable Gallium&#8208;Substituted Nitrilimine and its Reactivity with B&#8722;H, Si&#8722;H and B&#8722;B Bonds</title>

Reaction of diazomethane N2CHSiMe3 with the Ga(I) compound NacNacGa affords the nitrilimine complex 10 that undergoes 1,3&#8208;addition reactions with silane and borane to give products 16 and 17 but an unusual 1,1&#8208;addition of diborane (Bcat)2 (cat=catecholate) to give the diborylamide compound 18. DFT calculations provide insight into the mechanism of formation of compound 9 and 18.







Abstract
Reaction of the Ga(I) compound NacNacGa (9) with the diazo compound N2CHSiMe3 affords the nitrilimine compound NacNacGa(N&#8208;NCSiMe3)(CH2SiMe3) (10). Carrying out this reaction in the presence of pyridine does not lead to C&#8722;H activation on the transient alkylidene NacNacGa=CHSiMe3 but generates a metallated diazo species NacNacGa(NHN=CHSiMe3)(CN2SiMe3) (13) that further rearranges into the isonitrile compound NacNacGa(NHN=CHSiMe3)(N(NC)SiMe3) (15). Reactions of 10 with the silane H3SiPh and the borane HBcat furnished products of 1,3 addition to the nitrilimine moiety NacNacGa{N(ERn)NCSiMe3}(CH2SiMe3), whereas reaction with the diborane B2cat2 gave the product of formal nitrene insertion into the B&#8722;B bond. DFT calculations suggest that the interaction of 9 with N2CHSiMe3 proceeds through intermediate formation of an alkylidene compound that undergoes CH activation with a second molecule of N2CHSiMe3. Insertion into the B&#8722;B bond likely proceeds through an initial 1,3&#8208;addition of the diborane, followed by boryl migration to the former nitrene center.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaction of the Ga(I) compound NacNacGa (&lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;) with the diazo compound N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CHSiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; affords the nitrilimine compound NacNacGa(N-NCSiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) (&lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt;). Carrying out this reaction in the presence of pyridine does not lead to C&#8722;H activation on the transient alkylidene NacNacGa=CHSiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; but generates a metallated diazo species NacNacGa(NHN=CHSiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(CN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) (&lt;b&gt;13&lt;/b&gt;) that further rearranges into the isonitrile compound NacNacGa(NHN=CHSiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(N(NC)SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) (&lt;b&gt;15&lt;/b&gt;). Reactions of &lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt; with the silane H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiPh and the borane HBcat furnished products of 1,3 addition to the nitrilimine moiety NacNacGa{N(ER&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;)NCSiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), whereas reaction with the diborane B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;cat&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gave the product of formal nitrene insertion into the B&#8722;B bond. DFT calculations suggest that the interaction of &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt; with N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CHSiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; proceeds through intermediate formation of an alkylidene compound that undergoes CH activation with a second molecule of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CHSiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Insertion into the B&#8722;B bond likely proceeds through an initial 1,3-addition of the diborane, followed by boryl migration to the former nitrene center.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Carbon copy: The oxonitridocarbidosilicate CaLu[Si4N7&#8211;2xCxOx] (x&#8776;0.3) has been synthesized by carbothermal reduction and nitridation. Incorporation of carbon was confirmed by 13C and 29Si MAS NMR spectroscopy. Complementary EDX measurements suggest that simultaneous incorporation of oxygen compensates for the negative charge excess induced by carbon. Eu2+&#8208; and Ce3&#8208;doped CaLu[Si4N7&#8211;2xCxOx] (x&#8776;0.3) exhibit yellow&#8208;green and blue emission, respectively.







Abstract
The nitridosilicate CaLu[Si4N7&#8211;2xCxOx] (x&#8776;0.3) was synthesized by carbothermal reduction and nitridation starting from CaH2, Lu2O3, graphite and amorphous Si3N4 at 1550&#8201;&#176;C in a radiofrequency furnace. CaLu[Si4N7&#8211;2xCxOx] (x&#8776;0.3) crystallizes isotypically to many previously known MIIMIIISi4N7 compounds in the space group P63mc, as was confirmed by Rietveld refinement based on powder X&#8208;ray diffraction data. Incorporation of carbon into the crystal structure as a result of the carbothermal synthesis route was confirmed by 13C and 29Si MAS NMR spectroscopy. For the first time in the MIIMIIISi4N7 compound class, complementary EDX measurements suggest that simultaneous incorporation of oxygen compensates for the negative charge excess induced by carbon, resulting in an adjusted sum formula, CaLu[Si4N7&#8211;2xCxOx] (x&#8776;0.3). When excited with UV&#8208;to&#8208;blue light, CaLu[Si4N7&#8211;2xCxOx] (x&#8776;0.3) shows an emission maximum in the blue spectral region (&#955;em=484&#8197;nm; fwhm=4531&#8197;cm&#8722;1) upon doping with Ce3+, whereas Eu2+&#8208;doped CaLu[Si4N7&#8211;2xCxOx] (x&#8776;0.3) exhibits a yellow&#8208;green emission (&#955;em=546&#8197;nm; fwhm=3999&#8197;cm&#8722;1).

         <title>Bulky PNP Ligands Blocking Metal&#8208;Ligand Cooperation Allow for Isolation of Ru(0), and Lead to Catalytically Active Ru Complexes in Acceptorless Alcohol Dehydrogenation</title>

We synthesized two 4Me&#8722;PNP Ru complexes and compared their catalytic performance against two traditional analogues used in acceptorless alcohol dehydrogenation catalysis, leading us to identify a common deactivation pathway. The 4Me&#8722;PNP complexes, which do not undergo dearomatization upon addition of base, also allowed us to obtain rare, albeit unstable, 16 electron mono&#8208;CO Ru(0), and their subsequent Ru(II) reaction products.







Abstract
We synthesized two 4Me&#8722;PNP ligands which block metal&#8208;ligand cooperation (MLC) with the Ru center and compared their Ru complex chemistry to their two traditional analogues used in acceptorless alcohol dehydrogenation catalysis. The corresponding 4Me&#8722;PNP complexes, which do not undergo dearomatization upon addition of base, allowed us to obtain rare, albeit unstable, 16 electron mono&#8208;CO Ru(0) complexes. Reactivity with CO and H2 allows for stabilization and extensive characterization of bis&#8208;CO Ru(0) 18 electron and Ru(II) cis and trans dihydride species that were also shown to be capable of C(sp2) &#8722;H activation. Reactivity and catalysis are contrasted to non&#8208;methylated Ru(II) species, showing that an MLC pathway is not necessary, with dramatic differences in outcomes during catalysis between iPr and tBu PNP complexes within each of the 4Me and non&#8208;methylated backbone PNP series being observed. Unusual intermediates are characterized in one of the new and one of the traditional complexes, and a common catalysis deactivation pathway was identified.

         <title>Steric Repulsion Induced Conformational Switch in Supramolecular Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 4, January 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular strain engineering of dodecasubstituted picket&#8208;fence porphyrins led us to develop a method for selective atropisomeric conversion based on the steric clashes. The tension rigidified architecture revealed distinct spectroscopic alterations with vibrant colorimetric changes making it a first case study where the porphyrin&#8208;based photometric response is induced only by atropisomer configurations.







Abstract
Inspired by the rigidified architecture of &#8216;picket&#8208;fence&#8217; systems, we propose a strategy utilizing strain to impose intramolecular tension in already peripherally overcrowded structures leading to selective atropisomeric conversion. Employing this approach, tuneable shape&#8208;persistent porphyrin conformations were acquired exhibiting distinctive supramolecular nanostructures based on the orientation of the peripheral groups. The intrinsic assemblies driven by non&#8208;covalent bonding interactions form supramolecular polymers while encapsulating small molecules in parallel channels or solvent&#8208;accessible voids. The developed molecular strain engineering methodologies combined with synthetic approaches have allowed the introduction of the pivalate units creating a highly strained molecular skeleton. Changes in the absorption spectrum indicated the presence of severe steric repulsions between the peripheral groups which were confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. To release the steric strain introduced by the peripheral units, thermal equilibration strategies were used to selectively convert the most abundant atropisomer to the desirable minor one.

The tension rigidified architecture revealed distinct spectroscopic alterations with vibrant colorimetric changes making it a first case study where the porphyrin-based photometric response is induced only by atropisomer configurations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the rigidified architecture of &#8216;picket-fence&#8217; systems, we propose a strategy utilizing strain to impose intramolecular tension in already peripherally overcrowded structures leading to selective atropisomeric conversion. Employing this approach, tuneable shape-persistent porphyrin conformations were acquired exhibiting distinctive supramolecular nanostructures based on the orientation of the peripheral groups. The intrinsic assemblies driven by non-covalent bonding interactions form supramolecular polymers while encapsulating small molecules in parallel channels or solvent-accessible voids. The developed molecular strain engineering methodologies combined with synthetic approaches have allowed the introduction of the pivalate units creating a highly strained molecular skeleton. Changes in the absorption spectrum indicated the presence of severe steric repulsions between the peripheral groups which were confirmed by single crystal X-ray analysis. To release the steric strain introduced by the peripheral units, thermal equilibration strategies were used to selectively convert the most abundant atropisomer to the desirable minor one.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Low&#8208;Valent Titanium Species Stabilized with Aluminum/Boron Hydride Fragments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 4, January 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure and bonding of bimetallic half&#8208;sandwich titanium(III) and titanium(II) complexes stabilized by boron (BH4&#8722;, BH3Me&#8722;, B2H62&#8722;) or aluminum {(&#956;&#8208;H)2AlXL)} (X=Cl, Br; L=thf, OEt2) hydride ligands are reported. DFT calculations on the hydride&#8208;bridged Ti(II)&#8722;Al compounds reveal a strong electron density donation from the Ti&#8722;Ti bond to the empty s orbitals of the Al atoms. These unprecedented M&#8722;M&#8594;Z type interactions could be common for bi&#8208; or multimetallic low&#8208;valent early transition metal derivatives.







Abstract
Low&#8208;valent titanium species were prepared by reaction of [TiCp*X3] (Cp*=&#951;5&#8208;C5Me5; X=Cl, Br, Me) with LiEH4 (E=Al, B) or BH3(thf), and their structures elucidated by experimental and theoretical methods. The treatment of trihalides [TiCp*X3] with LiAlH4 in ethereal solvents (L) leads to the hydride&#8208;bridged heterometallic complexes [{TiCp*(&#956;&#8208;H)}2{(&#956;&#8208;H)2AlX(L)}2] (L=thf, X=Cl, Br; L=OEt2, X=Cl). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations for those compounds reveal an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state with a Ti&#8722;Ti bond and can be described as titanium(II) species. The theoretical analyses also show strong interactions between the Ti&#8722;Ti bond and the empty s orbitals of the Al atom of the AlH2XL fragments, which behave as &#963;&#8208;accepting (Z&#8208;type) ligands. Analogous reactions of [TiCp*X3] with LiBH4 (2 and 3&#8197;equiv.) in tetrahydrofuran at room temperature and at 85&#8201;&#176;C lead to the titanium(III) compounds [{TiCp*(BH4)(&#956;&#8208;X)}2] (X=Cl, Br) and [{TiCp*(BH4)(&#956;&#8208;BH4)}2], respectively. The treatment of [TiCp*Me3] with 4 and 5&#8197;equiv. of BH3(thf) produces the diamagnetic [{TiCp*(BH3Me)}2(&#956;&#8208;B2H6)] and paramagnetic [{TiCp*(&#956;&#8208;B2H6)}2] complexes, respectively.

Making the switch: This work disclosed the use of the Cu&#8722;Cu interaction of a mixed&#8208;valent tetrametallic copper complex (C&#8208;1) with a N&#8722;O&#8208;N Schiff base ligand for the generation of photoactive nanoscale copper [LCu0n, S&#8208;1] that showed stimuli (O2/light)&#8208;responsive switchable performance between its reduced (S&#8208;1) and oxidized [LCu0n&#8722;mCuOm, S&#8208;2] states, which serve as highly and poorly active (bistate, relative rate &gt;5&#8208; to 12&#8208;fold) catalyst to control two different antagonistic reactions.







Abstract
A discrete, photoactive, ultrafine copper nanocluster of fewer than hundreds of atoms with stimuli&#8208;responsive switchable redox&#8208;active states is highly desired to control two different antagonistic reactions. Herein, a mixed&#8208;valent tetrametallic copper complex (C&#8208;1) of N&#8722;O&#8208;N Schiff base ligand is disclosed, in which the five different Cu&#8722;Cu interactions were used to generate photoactive nanoscale copper [LCu0n, S&#8208;1] through the reduction of coordinated imine to the amine of C&#8208;1. The presence of a ligand provides stability and helps to homogenize the material (S&#8208;1) in the organic solvent. The cluster showed stimuli (O2/light)&#8208;responsive switching between its reduced (S&#8208;1) and oxidized [LCu0n&#8722;mCuOm, S&#8208;2] states that allows it to serve as a highly and poorly active (bistate, relative rate &gt;5&#8211;12 fold) catalyst for the dehydrogenation of alcohols to aldehydes and hydrogenation of nitroaromatics to amino aromatics under the light.

         <title>Anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Inhibitory Profile of New Quinoline Compounds in Cell Culture&#8208;Based Infection Models</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 4, January 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
New quinoline&#8208;based compounds were synthesized via conventional synthetic methods, including copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition reactions (CuAAC) and were studied for their activity against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. These quinoline derivatives showed pronounced cell culture&#8208;based inhibitory profiles against the virus (EC50 down to 1.5&#177;1.0&#8197;&#956;M), thus presenting a very promising developmental basis compared to reference drugs chloroquine (EC50=3.1&#177;2.7&#8197;&#956;M).







Abstract
The presently ongoing pandemic of human SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infections (COVID&#8208;19) presents an enormous challenge in surveillance, vaccine and antiviral drug development. Here we report the synthesis of new bioactive quinoline&#8208;morpholine hybrid compounds and their virological evaluation, which proves pronounced cell culture&#8208;based inhibitory profile against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Thus, selected quinoline compounds may suggest specific hit&#8208;to&#8208;lead development.

         <title>Photo&#8208; and Electrochemical Dual&#8208;Responsive Iridium Probe for Saccharide Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 4, January 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multimodal sensing: A luminescent iridium(III) complex, designed with boronic acid groups closely coupled to the metal centre, responds to sugar binding upon optical and electrochemical stimuli. The orange iridium luminescence signal is quenched by sugar binding in aqueous solutions at physiological pH. The signal is also observed in cancer cells, and is quenched by sugars at concentrations mimicking blood plasma. Hydrogel matrices with incorporated iridium complex retain the sensing response to sugars, providing an exemplar transition metal complex for saccharide&#8208;responsive devices.







Abstract
Dual detection systems are of interest for rapid, accurate data collection in sensing systems and in&#8197;vitro testing. We introduce an IrIII complex with a boronic acid receptor site attached to the 2&#8208;phenylpyridine ligand as an ideal probe with photo&#8208; and electrochemical signals that is sensitive to monosaccharide binding in aqueous solution. The complex displays orange luminescence at 618&#8197;nm, which is reduced by 70 and 40&#8201;% upon binding of fructose and glucose, respectively. The electro&#8208;chemiluminescent signal of the complex also shows a direct response to monosaccharide binding. The IrIII complex shows the same response upon incorporation into hydrogel matrices as in solution, thus demonstrating the potential of its integration into a device, as a nontoxic, simple&#8208;to&#8208;use tool to observe sugar binding over physiologically relevant pH ranges and saccharide concentrations. Moreover, the complex's luminescence is responsive to monosaccharide presence in cancer cells.

         <title>Deciphering the Role of Anions and Secondary Coordination Sphere in Tuning Anisotropy in Dy(III) Air&#8208;Stable D5h SIMs**
</title>

Bigger the better! The change of hydrogen&#8208;bonded halide anions in the secondary coordination sphere of a pseudo&#8208;D5h Dy(III) single&#8208;ion magnet shows a subtle alteration in the magnetic properties. The Ueff, TB and coercivity decrease in the order I&gt;Br&gt;Cl through change of anions in the secondary coordination sphere from larger iodide to smaller chloride ions.







Abstract
Precise control of the crystal field and symmetry around the paramagnetic spin centre has recently facilitated the engineering of high&#8208;temperature single&#8208;ion magnets (SIMs), the smallest possible units for future spin&#8208;based devices. In the present work, we report a series of air&#8208;stable seven coordinate Dy(III) SIMs {[L2Dy(H2O)5][X]3&#8901;L2&#8901;n(H2O), n = 0, X = Cl (1), n=1, X = Br (2), I (3)} possessing pseudo&#8208;D5h symmetry or pentagonal bipyramidal coordination geometry with high anisotropy energy barrier (Ueff) and blocking temperature (TB). While the strong axial coordination from the sterically encumbered phosphonamide, tBuPO(NHiPr)2 (L), increases the overall anisotropy of the system, the presence of high symmetry significantly quenches quantum tunnelling of magnetization, which is the prominent deactivating factor encountered in SIMs. The energy barrier (Ueff) and the blocking temperature (TB) decrease in the order 3&gt;2&gt;1 with the change of anions from larger iodide to smaller strongly hydrogen&#8208;bonded chloride in the secondary coordination sphere, albeit the local coordination geometry and the symmetry around the Dy(III) display only slight deviations. Ab initio CASSCF/RASSI&#8208;SO/SINGLE_ANISO calculations provide deeper insights into the dynamics of magnetic relaxation in addition to the role of the secondary coordination sphere in modulating the anisotropy of the D5h systems, using diverse models. Thus, in addition to the importance of the crystal field and the symmetry to obtain high&#8208;temperature SIMs, this study also probes the significance of the secondary coordination sphere that can be tailored to accomplish novel SIMs.

         <title>A Lead Mixed Halide with Three Different Coordinated Anions and Strong Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation Response</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 4, January 19, 2022. </description>

A new lead mixed halide, Cs3Pb2(CH3COO)2Br3I2, has been designed and rationally synthesized. Cs3Pb2(CH3COO)2Br3I2 featuring that three different anions (I&#8722;, Br&#8722; and O2&#8722;) simultaneously coordinate the Pb(II) atom into a severely distorted [PbBr2I2O2] polyhedron, exhibits a very strong phase&#8208;matching second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response of 9&#215;KH2PO4 (KDP) and a large birefringence (0.27@1064&#8197;nm). Systematic theoretical calculations demonstrate that the strong SHG effect of Cs3Pb2(CH3COO)2Br3I2 mainly originates from the oriented arrangement of [Pb2Br3I2] chains.







Abstract
Nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals are widely applied in information technology, micro&#8208;manufacturing and medical treatment. Herein, a new lead mixed halide with strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response, Cs3Pb2(CH3COO)2Br3I2, has been designed and rationally synthesized. Cs3Pb2(CH3COO)2Br3I2 represents the rare NLO crystal featuring that three different anions (I&#8722;, Br&#8722; and O2&#8722;) simultaneously coordinate the Pb(II) atom to form a severely distorted [PbBr2I2O2] polyhedron with a large polarizability. Remarkably, Cs3Pb2(CH3COO)2Br3I2 not only exhibits a very strong phase&#8208;matching SHG response of 9&#215;KH2PO4 (KDP), but also possesses a large birefringence (0.27@1064&#8197;nm) and high laser damage threshold (LDT). The strong SHG effect of Cs3Pb2(CH3COO)2Br3I2 mainly originates from the oriented arrangement of [Pb2Br3I2] chains. This study points out an effective strategy to develop new NLO crystals with strong SHG response.

The strong SHG effect of Cs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mainly originates from the oriented arrangement of [Pb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] chains. This study points out an effective strategy to develop new NLO crystals with strong SHG response.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Tin/Tin Oxide/CNT Catalysts for High&#8208;Performance Electrocatalytic Ethanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 4, January 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interfacial structure of Pt&#8722;Sn/SnOx/CNT composite electrocatalysts was rationally engineered on carbon nanotubes for achieving high&#8208;performance electrocatalytic ethanol oxidation. Through a carefully designed two&#8208;step (oxidation&#8208;reduction) heat&#8208;treatment route, the coverage of SnOx thin films on PtSn alloy nanoparticles can be facilely tuned by the strong interaction between Pt and SnOx. The optimized PtSn&#8722;SnOx interface showed significantly improved performances toward ethanol oxidation reaction.







Abstract
Ethanol is a promising liquid clean energy source in the energy conversion field. However, the self&#8208;poisoning caused by the strongly adsorbed reaction intermediates (typically, CO) is a critical problem in ethanol oxidation reaction. To address this issue, we proposed a joint use of two strategies, alloying of Pt with other metals and building Pt/metal&#8208;oxide interfaces, to achieve high&#8208;performance electrocatalytic ethanol oxidation. For this, a well&#8208;designed synthetic route combining wet impregnation with a two&#8208;step thermal treatment process was established to construct PtSn/SnOx interfaces on carbon nanotubes. Using this route, the alloying of Pt&#8722;Sn and formation of PtSn&#8722;SnOx interfaces can simultaneously be achieved, and the coverage of SnOx thin films on PtSn alloy nanoparticles can be facilely tuned by the strong interaction between Pt and SnOx. The results revealed that the partial coverage of SnOx species not only retained the active sites, but also enhanced the CO anti&#8208;poisoning ability of the catalyst. Consequently, the H&#8722;PtSn/SnOx/CNT&#8208;2 catalyst with an optimized PtSn&#8722;SnOx interface showed significantly improved performances toward the ethanol oxidation reaction (825&#8197;mA&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1). This study provides deep insights into the structure&#8208;performance relationship of PtSn/metal oxide composite catalysts, which would be helpful for the future design and fabrication of high&#8208;performance Pt&#8208;based ethanol oxidation reaction catalysts.

         <title>Gold N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysts for the Hydrofluorination of Alkynes Using Hydrofluoric Acid: Reaction Scope, Mechanistic Studies and the Tracking of Elusive Intermediates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 4, January 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unconventional fluorination: The development of the chemoselective gold&#8208;catalysed hydrofluorination of terminal alkynes using aqueous HF and an easily accessible N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;gold pre&#8208;catalyst is reported. Following the observation and isolation of unprecedented organometallic intermediates and computational studies, a catalytic cycle is proposed, featuring an in&#8197;situ generation of the chemoselective catalyst.







Abstract
An efficient and chemoselective methodology deploying gold&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes as catalysts in the hydrofluorination of terminal alkynes using aqueous HF has been developed. Mechanistic studies shed light on an in&#8197;situ generated catalyst, formed by the reaction of Br&#248;nsted basic gold pre&#8208;catalysts with HF in water, which exhibits the highest reactivity and chemoselectivity. The catalytic system has a wide alkyl substituted&#8208;substrate scope, and stoichiometric as well as catalytic reactions with tailor&#8208;designed gold pre&#8208;catalysts enable the identification of various gold species involved along the catalytic cycle. Computational studies aid in understanding the chemoselectivity observed through examination of key mechanistic steps for phosphine&#8208; and NHC&#8208;coordinated gold species bearing the triflate counterion and the elusive key complex bearing a bifluoride counterion.

Taken under its wing: Anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes that bear a weakly coordinating fluoroborate moiety have been used to prepare a new class of anionic imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;thione and &#8208;selone ligands; their coordination chemistry towards rhodium and iridium was explored to reveal, inter alia, their ability to develop secondary arene&#8208;metal interactions with the &#8220;wings&#8221; of the carbene ligands.







Abstract
The lithium salts of anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic thiones and selones [{(WCA&#8208;IDipp)E}Li(toluene)] (1: E=S; 2: E=Se; WCA=B(C6F5)3, IDipp=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene), which contain a weakly coordinating anionic (WCA) borate moiety in the imidazole backbone were reacted with Me3SiCl, to furnish the silylated adducts (WCA&#8208;IDipp)ESiMe3 (3: E=S; 4: E=Se). The reaction of the latter with [(&#951;5&#8208;C5Me5)MCl2]2 (M=Rh, Ir) afforded the rhodium(III) and iridium(III) half&#8208;sandwich complexes [{(WCA&#8208;IDipp)E}MCl(&#951;5&#8208;C5Me5)] (5&#8211;8). The direct reaction of the lithium salts 1 and 2 with a half or a full equivalent of [M(COD)Cl]2 (M=Rh, Ir) afforded the monometallic complexes [{(WCA&#8208;IDipp)E}M(COD)] (9&#8211;12) or the bimetallic complexes [&#956;2&#8208;{(WCA&#8208;IDipp)E}M2(COD)2(&#956;2&#8208;Cl)] (13&#8211;16), respectively. The bonding situation in these complexes has been investigated by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, revealing thiolate or selenolate ligand character with negligible metal&#8208;chalcogen &#960;&#8208;interaction.

Two new sodium aluminum borates, Na3AlB8O15 and Na3Al2B7O15, have been successfully synthesized by substitution of [AlO4] for [BO4] covalent tetrahedra from &#946;&#8208;Na2B6O10. Anionic&#8208;group architectures are transformed from a two&#8208;dimensional double layer to a three&#8208;dimensional framework.







Abstract
Two new sodium aluminum borates, Na3AlB8O15 and Na3Al2B7O15, have been successfully synthesized by the high&#8208;temperature solution method. They crystallize in the different space groups, P21/c and P2/c, respectively. The B&#8722;O configurations of &#946;&#8208;Na2B6O10, Na3AlB8O15 and Na3Al2B7O15 are compared to feature complicated different dimensional open&#8208;framework structures caused by the substitution of [BO4] by [AlO4] covalent tetrahedra. Moreover, the experimental results indicate that Na3AlB8O15 and Na3Al2B7O15 have short ultraviolet (UV) cutoff edges (&lt;187&#8197;nm). The first&#8208;principles calculations show that Na3AlB8O15 and Na3Al2B7O15 have moderate birefringence (0.075 and 0.041@1064&#8197;nm, respectively).

         <title>Two Faces of the Same Coin: Coupling X&#8208;Ray Absorption and NMR Spectroscopies to Investigate the Exchange Reaction Between Prototypical Cu Coordination Complexes</title>

A detailed investigation of the reduction of the octahedral Cu(terpyridine)22+ complex to the tetrahedral Cu(neocuproine)2+ complex using the chemical fuel 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;phenylpropanoic acid as reductant, has been carried out by exploiting an innovative mechanistic tool based on the complementarity of X&#8208;Ray Absorption and 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopies coupled with Multivariate Curve Resolution and theoretical analys.







Abstract
The satisfactory rationalization of complex reactive pathways in solution chemistry may greatly benefit from the combined use of advanced experimental and theoretical complementary methods of analysis. In this work, we combine X&#8208;Ray Absorption and 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopies with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Multivariate Curve Resolution and theoretical analyses to gain a comprehensive view on a prototypical reaction involving the variation of the oxidation state and local structure environment of a selected metal ion coordinated by organic ligands. Specifically, we investigate the 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;phenylpropanoic acid reduction of the octahedral complex established by the Cu2+ ion with terpyridine to the tetrahedral complex formed by Cu+ and neocuproine. Through our interdisciplinary approach we gain insights into the nature, concentration time evolution and structures of the key metal (XAS measurements) and organic (1H NMR measurements) species under reaction. We believe our method may prove to be useful in the toolbox necessary to understand the mechanisms of reactive processes of interest in solution.

Anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes that bear a weakly coordinating fluoroborate moiety have been used to prepare a new class of anionic imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;thione and &#8208;selone ligands; their coordination chemistry towards rhodium and iridium was explored to reveal their ability to develop secondary arene&#8211;metal interactions with the &#8220;wings&#8221; of the carbene ligands. More information about these new additions to the family of chalcogenolate ligands and their potential future application in coordination chemistry, bioinorganic chemistry and homogeneous catalysis can be found in the Research Article by M. Tamm et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104139).

The application of 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole derivatives (BTDs) as fluorescence imaging bioprobes has a successful history as told by B. A. D. Neto et&#8197;al. As the pioneering group, and still as one of the most active groups in this field of research, they have reviewed this history since the first publication, that is, nearly one decade after the introduction of BTDs as bioprobes to imaging cells&#8217; organelles, tissues, multicellular organisms and animal models. The evolution, strategies of molecular design, gaps and perspectives are described in this review on page&#8197;5&#8197;ff. The character depicted in this image is dedicated to the artist.

Thanks to the concept of synchrotron radiation ECD imaging (SR&#8208;ECDi) applied to the active pharmaceutical ingredient Finasteride, we obtained an exclusive insight into the critical role played by the anisotropy of local domains in solid&#8208;state ECD spectra. Our findings open a new way to interpret solid&#8208;state chiroptical measurements and will broaden their application to probing and mapping solid chiral materials. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. G&#243;recki, L. Di&#8197;Bari, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103632).

         <dc:description>
In this review, we summarize the developments in the field of metal&#8208;catalyzed haloalkynylation reactions. In these C&#8722;C coupling reactions, both an alkynyl unit and a halogen atom are transferred with atom economy to unsaturated compounds such as arynes, alkenes and alkynes resulting in the formation of halogenated products. For more details, see the Minireview by M. Kreuzahler and G. Haberhauer on page 33.

A new anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 compound, developed in this joint study, is shown in front of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 viruses. The ongoing pandemic of human SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infections (COVID&#8208;19) creates a high demand for antiviral drug development. The shown quinoline&#8211;morpholine hybrid and other new quinoline&#8208;based compounds were synthesized and investigated for their in vitro activity against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. They exerted an anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 activity similar to or stronger than that of the reference drug. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Marschall, S.&#8197;B. Tsogoeva et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103861).

         <title>Fluorescent Benzothiadiazole Derivatives as Fluorescence Imaging Dyes: A Decade of New Generation Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 4, January 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Go bio! The use of fluorescent benzothiadiazole small molecules as bioimaging probes has been reviewed. After more than a decade since the first application in cell&#8208;imaging experiments, a huge evolution in their utilization has been noted. Still, there is much room for improvements, creative ideas, and advances in the use of these dyes.







Abstract
The current review describes advances in the use of fluorescent 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole (BTD) derivatives after nearly one decade since the first description of bioimaging experiments using this class of fluorogenic dyes. The review describes the use of BTD&#8208;containing fluorophores applied as, inter alia, bioprobes for imaging cell nuclei, mitochondria, lipid droplets, sensors, markers for proteins and related events, biological processes and activities, lysosomes, plasma membranes, multicellular models, and animals. A number of physicochemical and photophysical properties commonly observed for BTD fluorogenic structures are also described.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Haloalkynylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 4, January 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal catalysts can be used to react haloacetylenes with unsaturated compounds such as arynes, alkenes and alkynes, whereby the alkynyl unit and the halogen atom are usually added to adjacent positions. Cu, Pd and Au metal complexes have so far proved to be particularly suitable catalysts. The choice of catalyst system decisively determines the regio&#8208; and stereochemistry of the resulting halogenated product.







Abstract
Metal catalysis has revolutionized synthetic chemistry, leading to entirely new, very efficient transformations, which enable access to complex functionalized molecules. One such new transformation method is the haloalkynylation reaction, in which both a halogen atom and an alkynyl unit are transferred to an unsaturated carbon&#8208;carbon bond. This minireview summarizes the development of metal&#8208;catalyzed haloalkynylation reactions since their beginning about a decade ago. So far, arynes, alkenes and alkynes have been used as unsaturated systems and the reactivities of these systems are summarized in individual chapters of the minireview. Especially, the last few years have witnessed a rapid development due to gold&#8208;catalyzed reactions. Here, we discuss how the choice of the catalytic system influences the regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity of the addition.

         <title>PEGylated Poly&#8208;HDACi: A Designer Polyprodrug from Optimized Drug Units**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 4, January 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A designer tri&#8208;block copolymer is described to broaden epigenetic combination therapy. Upon intracellular reduction and esterase hydrolysis, it releases nothing but HDACi (histone deacetylase inhibitor) drug, CO2, and PEG. The design is rooted from a thiol&#8208;based HDACi, for which optimization balances requirements of both efficacy and control&#8208;release, highlighting a new paradigm in polyprodrug nanomedicine: taking pharmaceutics guidelines into account at the medicinal chemistry stage.







Abstract
We designed, synthesized, and characterized a tri&#8208;block copolymer. Its hydrophobic part, a chain of histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) prodrug, was symmetrically flanked by two identical PEG blocks, whereas the built&#8208;in HDACi was a linear molecule, terminated with a thiol at one end, and a hydroxyl group at the other. Such a feature facilitated end&#8208;to&#8208;end linkage of prodrugs through alternatively aligned disulfides and carbonates. The disulfides served dual roles: redox sensors of smart nanomedicine, and warheads of masked HDACi drugs. This approach, carefully designed to benefit both control&#8208;release and efficacy, is conceptually novel for optimizing drug units in nanomedicine. Micelles from this designer polyprodrug released only PEG, CO2 and HDACi, and synergized with DOX against HCT116 cells, demonstrating its widespread potential in combination therapy. Our work highlights, for the first time, the unique advantage of thiol&#8208;based drug molecules in nanomedicine design.

         <title>Acenaphtho[1,2&#8208;d][1,2,3]triazole and Its Kuratowski Complex: A &#960;&#8208;Extended Tecton for Supramolecular and Coordinative Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 4, January 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional structures can be assembled from &#960;&#8208;extended triazoles, which act as versatile tectons capable of metal coordination, hydrogen bonding, and &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions. Infinite stacks of cyclic hydrogen&#8208;bonded tetrads or triads are obtained in the crystal, with substitution controlling the size of the assembly.

&#960;&#8208;Extended acenaphtho[1,2&#8208;d][1,2,3]triazoles, the unsubstituted Anta&#8208;H and its di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl derivative Dibanta&#8208;H, as well as 5,6,7,8&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;naphtho[2,3&#8208;d][1,2,3]triazole Cybta&#8208;H were obtained in concise syntheses. In the solid state, Dibanta&#8208;H forms an unprecedented hydrogen&#8208;bonded cyclic tetrad, stabilized by dispersion interactions of the bulky tBu substituents, whereas a cyclic triad was found in the crystal structure of Anta&#8208;H. These cyclic assemblies form infinite slipped stacks in the crystals. Evidence for analogous hydrogen&#8208;bonded self&#8208;assembly in solution was provided by low&#8208;temperature NMR spectroscopy and computational analyses. Kuratowski&#8208;type pentanuclear complexes [Zn5Cl4(Dibanta)6] and [Zn5Cl4(Cybta)6] were prepared from the respective triazoles. In the Dibanta complexes, the &#960;&#8208;aromatic surfaces of the ligands extend from the edges of the tetrahedral Zn5 core, yielding an enlarged structure with significant internal molecular free volume and red&#8208;shifted fluorescence.

         <title>Photobase&#8208;Driven Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer (ESIPT) in a Strapped &#960;&#8208;Electron System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 4, January 19, 2022. </description>

A pyridine&#8208;centered donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;type fluorophore acts as a photobase to induce strap&#8208;to&#8208;&#960; excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) from a strapped ammonium moiety. This new design of an ESIPT fluorophore, which is suitable for use in acidic media, produces a significantly red&#8208;shifted orange emission with an increased fluorescence quantum yield.







Abstract
We report a new design strategy for an excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) fluorophore that can be used in acidic media. A photobasic pyridine&#8208;centered donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;type fluorophore is combined with a basic trialkylamine &#8220;strap&#8221;. In the presence of an acid, protonation occurs predominantly at the amine moiety in the ground state. A single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis confirmed the formation of a pre&#8208;organized intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonded structure between the resulting ammonium moiety and the pyridine ring. Upon excitation, the intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer transition increases the basicity of the pyridine moiety in the excited state, resulting in proton transfer from the amine to the pyridine moiety. Consequently, the fluorophore takes on a polymethine&#8208;dye character in the ESIPT state, which gives rise to significantly red&#8208;shifted emission with an increased fluorescence quantum yield.

         <title>An Alternative Route to Complex Allenes or Cyclooctatrienes via a Suzuki Cyclocarbopalladation Cascade</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 4, January 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preparation of elaborate polycycles using the Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling reaction has been developed. If compounds 1&#8201;a&#8211;c are substituted by a triple bond an unusual cascade reaction affords allene derivatives 3 stereoselectively, while the presence of a substituted double bond, when reacted with a boronic ester or acid on 4, furnishes polysubstituted cyclooctatrienes 22 in high yields.







Abstract
The 4&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclocarbopalladation of vinyl bromides substituted with a triple or double bond resulted in impressive cascade reactions leading to different compounds under Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling conditions upon a slight modification of the starting material. When the starting compound carries a triple bond, a single cascade occurs providing a structure containing an allene, a tetrasubstituted cyclopropane, and a cyclobutene with complete stereoselectivity. When the related starting material possessing a double bond is reacted under the same conditions in the presence of various vinyl boronic esters or acids, an efficient 8&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization provides tricyclic systems comprised of a cyclobutene unit, as well as a cyclooctatriene. Five carbons of the latter can be selectively decorated with different substituents depending on the choice of the starting material and the boronic coupling partner.

         <title>Role of anionic backbone in NHC&#8208;stabilized coinage metal complexes: New precursors for atomic layer deposition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cu and Ag precursors that are volatile, reactive, and thermally stable are currently of high interest for their application in atomic layer deposition (ALD) of thin metal films. In pursuit of new precursors for coinage metals namely Cu and Ag, a series of new N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) based Cu(I) and Ag(I) complexes were synthesized. Modifications in the substitution pattern of diketonate&#8208;based anionic backbones led to five monomeric Cu complexes and four closely related Ag complexes with the general formula [M(  tBu  NHC)(R)] (M = Cu, Ag;  tBu  NHC = 1,3&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene; R = diketonate). Thermal analysis indicated that most of the Cu complexes are thermally stable and volatile compared to the more fragile Ag analogs. One of the promising Cu precursors was evaluated for the ALD of nanoparticulate Cu metal deposits using hydroquinone as the reducing agent at appreciably low deposition temperatures (145&#8211;160 &#176;C). This study highlights the considerable impact of the employed ligand sphere on the structural and thermal properties of metal complexes that are relevant for vapor phase processing of thin films.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational Insights into the Allosteric Effect and Dynamic Structural Features of the SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 Spike Protein</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Evolution and other transformations: The binding of ACE2 triggers an obvious conformational transformation of the SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 spike protein. Compared with SARS&#8208;COV, several aspects of the spike protein of SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 have evolved, including its binding affinity with ACE2 as well as the structural features of cleavage sites.







Abstract
COVID&#8208;19 caused by SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 is continuing to surge globally. The spike (S) protein is the key protein of SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 that recognizes and binds to the host target ACE2. In this study, molecular dynamics simulation was used to elucidate the allosteric effect of the S protein. Binding of ACE2 caused a centripetal movement of the receptor&#8208;binding domain of the S protein. The dihedral changes in Phe329 and Phe515 played a key role in this process. Two potential cleavage sites S1/S2 and S2&#8242; were exposed on the surface after the binding of ACE2. The binding affinity of SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 S protein and ACE2 was higher than that of SARS&#8208;COV. This was mainly due to the mutation of Asp480 in SARS&#8208;COV to Ser494 in SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2, which greatly weakened the electrostatic repulsion. The result provides a theoretical basis for the SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 infection and aids the development of biosensors and detection reagents.

         <title>Synthesis, Structure, and Dynamics of Chiral Eight&#8208;Membered Cyclic Molecules with Thienylene and Cyclopropylene Units Alternately Connected</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cyclooligomerization of bifunctional monomers possessing triazolyl (carbene precursor) and vinyl groups at 2,3&#8208; and 3,4&#8208;positions on the thiophene ring is studied. Cyclic dimers, which adopt a tub&#8208;shaped conformation, are obtained as the major components. We also observe the phenomenon of racemization caused by a tub&#8208;to&#8208;tub ring&#8208;flipping, the activation energy of which is determined as 108&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 by electronic circular dichroism spectra measurement.

         <title>Asymmetric Catalytic Assembly of Triple&#8208;Columned and Multilayered Chiral Folding Polymers Showing Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A first asymmetric catalytic approach to multilayer 3D folding polymers by using Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling in the presence of chiral catalysts. The resulting multiple &#960;&#8208;assemblies exhibited remarkable optical properties in aggregated states (photoluminescence in solids and aggregation&#8208;induced emission in solutions), as well as reversible redox properties in electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Unprecedented chiral multilayer folding 3D polymers have been assembled and regulated by uniform and differentiated aromatic chromophore units between naphthyl piers. Screening catalysts, catalytic systems and monomers were proven to be crucial for asymmetric catalytic Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura polycouplings for this assembly. X&#8208;ray crystallography of the corresponding dimers and trimers revealed the absolute configuration and the intermolecular packing pattern. Up to 61&#8201;960 Mw/41&#8201;900 Mn and m/z 4317 for polymers and oligomers, as confirmed by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and MALDI&#8208;TOF MS, indicated that these frameworks were composed of multiple stacked layers. The resulting multiple &#960;&#8208;assemblies exhibited remarkable optical properties in aggregated states (photoluminescence in solids and aggregation&#8208;induced emission in solutions), as well as reversible redox properties in electrochemical performance.

Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion and substituent conformational switching &#8211; mediated hysteretic spin&#8208;state switching is reported for two mononuclear iron(II)&#8208;2,6&#8208;bis(1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridine) (bpp) complexes. Stable hysteretic switching of &#916;T1/2=62&#8197;K and &#916;T=288&#8197;K is observed for one of the complexes: Fe[(bpp&#8722;COOEt)2](ClO4)2&#8901;CH3NO2. This complex is unprecedented for the iron(II)&#8722;bpp family and encourages the pursuit of iron(II)&#8208;based SCO complexes for molecule&#8208;based switching and memory applications.







Abstract
Bistable spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) complexes that undergo abrupt and hysteretic (&#916;T1/2) spin&#8208;state switching are desirable for molecule&#8208;based switching and memory applications. In this study, we report on structural facets governing hysteretic SCO in a set of iron(II)&#8208;2,6&#8208;bis(1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridine) (bpp) complexes &#8211; [Fe(bpp&#8722;COOEt)2](X)2&#8901;CH3NO2 (X=ClO4, 1; X=BF4, 2). Stable spin&#8208;state switching &#8211; T1/2=288&#8197;K; &#916;T1/2=62&#8197;K &#8211; is observed for 1, whereas 2 undergoes above&#8208;room&#8208;temperature lattice&#8208;solvent content&#8208;dependent SCO &#8211; T1/2=331&#8197;K; &#916;T1/2=43&#8197;K. Variable&#8208;temperature single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of the complexes revealed pronounced molecular reorganizations &#8211; from the Jahn&#8208;Teller&#8208;distorted HS state to the less distorted LS state &#8211; and conformation switching of the ethyl group of the COOEt substituent upon SCO. Consequently, we propose that the large structural reorganizations rendered SCO hysteretic in 1 and 2. Such insights shedding light on the molecular origin of thermal hysteresis might enable the design of technologically relevant molecule&#8208;based switching and memory elements.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bistable spin-crossover (SCO) complexes that undergo abrupt and hysteretic (&#916;&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;) spin-state switching are desirable for molecule-based switching and memory applications. In this study, we report on structural facets governing hysteretic SCO in a set of iron(II)-2,6-bis(1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine) (bpp) complexes &#8211; [Fe(bpp&#8722;COOEt)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;](X)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&#8901;&lt;/b&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (X=ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;; X=BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;). Stable spin-state switching &#8211; &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;=288&#8197;K; &#916;&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;=62&#8197;K &#8211; is observed for &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, whereas &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; undergoes above-room-temperature lattice-solvent content-dependent SCO &#8211; &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;=331&#8197;K; &#916;&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;=43&#8197;K. Variable-temperature single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies of the complexes revealed pronounced molecular reorganizations &#8211; from the Jahn-Teller-distorted HS state to the less distorted LS state &#8211; and conformation switching of the ethyl group of the COOEt substituent upon SCO. Consequently, we propose that the large structural reorganizations rendered SCO hysteretic in &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;. Such insights shedding light on the molecular origin of thermal hysteresis might enable the design of technologically relevant molecule-based switching and memory elements.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Gas Phase Preparation of the Elusive Monobridged Ge(&#956;&#8208;H)GeH Molecule through Nonadiabatic Reaction Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hitherto elusive monobridged Ge(&#956;&#8208;H)GeH molecule was prepared in the gas phase through bimolecular reaction of atomic germanium with germane (GeH4). The divergent chemistries of germanium versus carbon are reflected when comparing the acetylene isomers with the isovalent germanium analogues. This reaction deepens our understanding of the role of nonadiabatic reaction dynamics in preparing nonclassical, hydrogen&#8208;bridged isomers carrying main group XIV elements.







Abstract
The hitherto elusive monobridged Ge(&#956;&#8208;H)GeH (X1A&#8242;) molecule was prepared in the gas phase by bimolecular reaction of atomic germanium with germane (GeH4). Electronic structure calculations revealed that this reaction commenced on the triplet surface with the formation of a van der Waals complex, followed by insertion of germanium into a germanium&#8208;hydrogen bond over a submerged barrier to form the triplet digermanylidene intermediate (HGeGeH3); the latter underwent intersystem crossing from the triplet to the singlet surface. On the singlet surface, HGeGeH3 predominantly isomerized through two successive hydrogen shifts prior to unimolecular decomposition to Ge(&#956;&#8208;H)GeH isomer, which is in equilibrium with the vinylidene&#8208;type (H2GeGe) and dibridged (Ge(&#956;&#8208;H2)Ge) isomers. This reaction leads to the formation of cyclic dinuclear germanium molecules, which do not exist on the isovalent C2H2 surface, thus deepening our understanding of the role of nonadiabatic reaction dynamics in preparing nonclassical, hydrogen&#8208;bridged isomers carrying main group XIV elements.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of biomolecules provides a powerful bottom&#8208;up strategy to build functional nanostructures and materials. Among the different biomacromolecules, protein cages offer various advantages including uniform size, versatility, multi&#8208;modularity and high stability. Additionally, protein cage crystals present confined microenvironments with well&#8208;defined dimensions. On the other hand, molecular hosts, such as cyclophanes, possess a defined cavity size and selective recognition of guest molecules. However, successful combination of macrocycles and protein cages to achieve functional co&#8208;crystals have remained limited. In this study, we demonstrate the electrostatic binding between cationic pillar[5]arenes and (apo)ferritin cages, which results in porous and crystalline frameworks. The electrostatically assembled crystals present face&#8208;center cubic (FCC) lattice and have been characterized by means of small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) and cryo&#8208;TEM. These hierarchical structures result in a multiadsorbent framework capable of hosting both organic and inorganic pollutants, such as dyes and toxic metals, with potential application in water remediation technologies.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, mechanochemistry has enriched the toolbox of synthetic chemists, enabling faster and more sustainable access to new materials and existing products, including active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). However, molecular&#8208;level understanding of most mechanochemical reactions remains limited, delaying the implementation of mechanochemistry in industrial applications. Herein, we have applied in&#8208;situ monitoring by Raman spectroscopy to the mechanosynthesis of phenytoin, a World Health Organization (WHO) Essential Medicine, enabling the observation, isolation, and characterization of key molecular&#8208;migration intermediates involved in the single&#8208;step transformation of benzil, urea, and KOH into phenytoin. This work contributes to the elucidation of a reaction mechanism that has been subjected to a number of interpretations over time and paints a clear picture of how mechanosynthesis can be applied and optimized for the preparation of added&#8208;value molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Four dibenzofuran&#8208;terminated high triplet energy hole&#8208;transporters for high&#8208;efficiency and long&#8208;life organic light&#8208;emitting devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The weak stability of a hole&#8208;transporter upon approaching anion state is one of the major bottlenecks for developing long&#8208;life organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs). Therefore, in this study, we developed a series of thermally and electrically stable hole&#8208;transporters that are end&#8208;capped with four dibenzofuran units. These materials exhibit (i) high bond dissociation energy (BDE) toward anion state, (ii) high glass transition temperature ( T g&#160; &gt;130 &#176;C), and (iii) high triplet energy ( E T&#160; &gt;2.7 eV), thereby enabling approximately 20% high external quantum efficiency (EQE) and significantly prolonging the stability of both thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) and phosphorescent OLEDs with an operation lifetime at 50% (LT 50 ) of 20000&#8211;30000 h at 1000 cd m &#8208;2 . In addition, investigating their structure&#8208;property relationship revealed that ionization potential ( I P ), BDE, and&#160; T g&#160; are critical prerequisites for the hole&#8208; transporter to prolong lifetime in OLEDs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Developing robust oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts with excellent performance is essential for conversion of renewable electricity to clean fuel. Herein, we present a facile concept for the design of efficient high entropy metal&#8208;organic frameworks (HEMOFs) as electrocatalyst by one&#8208;step solvothermal synthesis. The strategy allows for control of the microstructure and corresponding lattice distortion by tuning the metal ion composition. As a result, the OER activity was improved by optimising the coordination environment of the metal catalytic center. The environment affects the electronic density and consequently binding energies of oxygenated intermediates at the metal ion centers. The optimized Co&#8208;rich HEMOFs exhibited a low overpotential of 310 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm &#8208;2 , better than RuO 2 catalyst. The finding involves lattice distortion of the high entropy MOFs provides more strategy for developing high&#8208;performance electrocatalyst for energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Activation by Glutathione in Hypoxic Environment of an Azo&#8208;based Rhodamine Activatable Photosensitizer. A Computational Elucidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the present paper, density functional theory (DFT) has been applied to the study of the activation mechanism of a new selenium azo&#8208;rhodamine (azoSeRho) in presence of the tripeptide thiol, glutathione (GSH), as potent photosensitizer to be employed in photodynamic therapy. The introduction of the azo group into the conjugated system of the seleno&#8208;rhodamine dye and its reaction with GSH allow the selective formation of the active photosensitizer, SeRho. Furthermore, DFT calculations have allowed to shed light on the activation mechanism of the azoSeRho photosensitizer when molecular oxygen is present and hydrogen peroxide is formed. This study is the first theoretical investigation revealing how the reductive cleavage of the azo moiety by GSH occurs. Time&#8208;dependent DFT approach has been used to evaluate the chalcogen&#8208;substitution effect on the structures and photophysical properties of the azo derivatives and, then, on the activated photosensitizers.</dc:description>

         <title>Remote Oxidative Activation of a [Cp*Rh] Monohydride</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Half&#8208;sandwich rhodium monohydrides are often proposed as intermediates in catalysis, but little is known regarding the redox&#8208;induced reactivity accessible to these species. Here, the bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene (dppf) ligand has been used to explore the reactivity that can be induced when a [Cp*Rh] monohydride undergoes remote (dppf&#8208;centered) oxidation by 1e  &#8211;  . Chemical and electrochemical studies show that one&#8208;electron redox chemistry is accessible to Cp*Rh(dppf), including a unique quasi&#8208;reversible Rh  II/I  process at &#8211;0.96 V vs. ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fc  +/0  ). This redox manifold was confirmed by isolation of an uncommon Rh(II) species, [Cp*Rh(dppf)]  +  , that was characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Protonation of Cp*Rh(dppf) with anilinium triflate yielded an isolable and inert monohydride, [Cp*Rh(dppf)H]  +  , and this species was found to undergo a quasireversible electrochemical oxidation at +0.41 V vs Fc  +/0  that corresponds to iron&#8208;centered oxidation in the dppf backbone. Thermochemical analysis predicts that this dppf&#8208;centered oxidation drives a dramatic increase in acidity of the Rh&#8211;H moiety by 23 p  K  a  units, a reactivity pattern confirmed by  in situ  1  H NMR studies. Taken together, these results show that remote oxidation can effectively induce M&#8211;H activation and suggest that ligand&#8208;centered redox activity could be an attractive feature for the design of new systems relying on hydride intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinase sensing based on protein interactions at the catalytic site</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The role kinases play in regulating cellular processes makes them potential biomarkers for detecting the onset and prognosis of various diseases, including many types of cancer. Current kinase biosensors, including electrochemical and radiometric methods, rely on sensing the ATP&#8208;dependent enzymatic phosphorylation reaction. Here we introduce a new type of interaction&#8208;based electrochemical kinase biosensor that does not require any chemical labelling or modification. The basis for sensing is the interactions between the catalytic site of the kinase and the phosphorylation site of its substrate rather than the phosphorylation reaction. We demonstrated this concept with the ERK2 kinase and its substrate protein HDGF, which is involved in lung cancer. A peptide monolayer derived from the HDGF phosphorylation site was adsorbed onto a gold electrode and was used to sense ERK2 without ATP. The sensitivity of the assay was down to 10 nM of ERK2, corresponding with the range of its cellular concentration. Surface chemistry analysis confirmed that ERK2 was bound to the HDGF peptide monolayer. This increased the permeability of redox&#8208;active species through the monolayer and resulted in ERK2 electrochemical sensing. Since our detection approach is based on protein&#8208;protein interactions and not on the enzymatic reaction, it can be further utilized for more selective detection of different types of enzymes.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The role kinases play in regulating cellular processes makes them potential biomarkers for detecting the onset and prognosis of various diseases, including many types of cancer. Current kinase biosensors, including electrochemical and radiometric methods, rely on sensing the ATP-dependent enzymatic phosphorylation reaction. Here we introduce a new type of interaction-based electrochemical kinase biosensor that does not require any chemical labelling or modification. The basis for sensing is the interactions between the catalytic site of the kinase and the phosphorylation site of its substrate rather than the phosphorylation reaction. We demonstrated this concept with the ERK2 kinase and its substrate protein HDGF, which is involved in lung cancer. A peptide monolayer derived from the HDGF phosphorylation site was adsorbed onto a gold electrode and was used to sense ERK2 without ATP. The sensitivity of the assay was down to 10 nM of ERK2, corresponding with the range of its cellular concentration. Surface chemistry analysis confirmed that ERK2 was bound to the HDGF peptide monolayer. This increased the permeability of redox-active species through the monolayer and resulted in ERK2 electrochemical sensing. Since our detection approach is based on protein-protein interactions and not on the enzymatic reaction, it can be further utilized for more selective detection of different types of enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photo&#8208;degradable protein&#8208;polymer hybrid shells for caging living cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is growing demand for the precise remote control of cellular functions in various fields. Herein, we report a method for caging mammalian cells by coating with photodegradable protein&#8208;polymer hybrid shells to photo&#8208;control their functions without genetic engineering. A layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly of photocleavable synthetic materials through biotin&#8208;streptavidin (SA) binding was employed for cell coating. The cell surfaces were first biotinylated with photocleavable biotinylated poly(ethylene glycol)(PEG)&#8208;lipid and then coated by repeatedly layering SA and micelles of the PEG&#8208;lipid and photocleavable biotinylated four&#8208;arm PEG. The cell extension and adhesion were suppressed with the shells and then triggered with the degradation of the shells by light exposure. Macrophage phagocytosis was also stopped by caging with the shells and restarted by light&#8208;guided uncaging. This study provides the first proof of principle that cellular functions can be remotely controlled by steric hinderance of cell surfaces with photodegradable materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbodiimide&#8208;driven dimerization and self&#8208;assembly of artificial, ribose&#8208;based amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The aqueous self&#8208;assembly of amphiphiles into aggregates such as micelles and vesicles has been widely investigated over the past decades with applications ranging from materials science to drug delivery. The combination of characteristic properties of nucleic acids and amphiphiles is of substantial interest to mimic biological self&#8208;organization and compartmentalization. Herein, we present ribose&#8208; and ribonucleotide&#8208;based amphiphiles and investigate their self&#8208;assembly as well as their fundamental reactivity. We found that various types of aggregates are formed, ranging in size from nanometers to micrometers and all amphiphiles exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) in solution as well as in the solid state. We also observed that the addition of 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;(3&#8208;dimethylaminopropyl)&#8208;carbodiimide (EDC) leads to rapid and selective dimerization of the amphiphiles into pyrophosphates, which decreases the critical aggregation concentration (CAC) by a factor of 25 when compared to the monomers. Since the propensity for amphiphile dimerization is correlated with their tendency to self&#8208;assemble, our results may be relevant for the formation of rudimentary compartments under prebiotic conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Acetylene Derivatives of Cationic Diazaoxatriangulenes and Diaza [4]Helicenes &#8211; Access to Red Emitters and Planar Chiral Stereochemical Traits</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cationic triangulenes, and related helicenes, constitute a rich class of dyes and fluorophores, usually absorbing and emitting light at low energy, in the orange to red domains. Recently, to broaden the scope of applications, regioselective late&#8208;stage functionalizations on these core moieties have been developed. For instance, with the introduction of electron&#8208;donating groups (EDGs), important bathochromic shifts are observed pushing absorptions towards or in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectral domain while emissive properties disappear essentially completely. Herein, to upset this drawback, acetylene derivatives of cationic diazaoxa triangulenes (DAOTA) and [4]helicenes are prepared (16 examples). Contrary to other EDG&#8208;functionalized derivatives, C&#8801;C&#8208;functionalized products remain broadly fluorescent, with red&#8208;shifted absorptions (Dlabs up to 25 nm) and emissions (Dlem up to 73 nm, FPL up to 51%). Quite interestingly, a general dynamic stereoisomerism phenomenon is evidenced for the compounds derived from achiral DAOTA cores. At low temperature in 1H&#8208;NMR spectroscopy (218 K), N&#8208;CH2 protons become diastereotopic with chemical shifts differences (Dd) as high as +1.64 ppm. The signal coalescence occurs around 273 K with a barrier of ~12 kcal.mol&#8208;1. This phenomenon is due to planar chiral conformations (Sp and Rp configurations), induced by the geometry of the alkyl (n&#8208;propyl) side&#8208;chains next to the acetylenic substituents. Finally, DFT calculations offer a valuable insight on geometries, stereodynamics and on the large difference in NMR for some of the diastereotopic protons.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox replacement of Ag on MOF&#8208;derived Cu/C&#8208;nanoparticles on gas diffusion electrodes for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>During the electrochemical CO  2  reduction reaction, bime&#173;tallic tandem catalysts have emerged as a promising strategy to local&#173;ly increase the CO flux for maximizing the conversion rate towards C&#8208;C coupled products. Considering this, a novel Cu/C&#8208;Ag nanostruc&#173;tured catalyst was prepared by a redox replacement process, where the ratio of both metals can be tuned by the replacement time. An optimum Cu/Ag composition with similarly sized particles showed the highest CO  2  conversion to C  2+  products compared to non&#8208;Ag modified gas&#8208;diffusion electrodes. Gas chromatography and  in&#8208;situ  Raman measurements in a CO  2  gas diffusion cell suggest the formation of top bound linear adsorbed &#1645;CO followed by consumption of CO in the successive cascade steps as evidenced by increasing the &#957;C&#8208;H bands. These findings suggest that two mechanisms are simultane&#173;ously operating towards the production of HCO  2  H and C&#8208;C coupled products on the Cu/Ag bimetallic surface.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical Sandmeyer&#8208;type Halogenation of Arenediazonium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One hundred and forty years after its discovery, key limitations of the Sandmeyer reaction were overcome. The use of trihalide salts as mediators enable the photochemical conversion of diazonium salts into the corresponding aryl halides without an environmentally problematic transition&#8208;metal mediator. A wide variety of aryl bromides, chlorides and iodides were formed in excellent selectivities for halogenation over hydridodediazotization, obviating the laborious separation of halogenated products from non&#8208;halogenated analogues.@ruhrunibochum







Abstract
Trihalide salts were found to efficiently promote photochemical dediazotizing halogenations of diazonium salts. In contrast to classical Sandmeyer reactions, no metal catalysts are required to achieve high yields and outstanding selectivities for halogenation over competing hydridodediazotization. Convenient protocols are disclosed for synthetically meaningful brominations, iodinations, and chlorinations of diversely functionalized derivatives.

The noble&#8208;gas difluorides, NgF2 (Ng=Kr, Xe), react with MOF4 (M=Mo, W) in HF solvent and melts to form NgF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;MOF4 and XeF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2MOF4. Structures and bonding were characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. The NgF2 ligands coordinate to the metal through F&#8208;bridges, where Fb is trans to M=O in FtNgFb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;MOF4 and Fb&#8217; is cis to M=O and trans to M&#8217;=O in FtXeFb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;M(OF3)Fb&#8242;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;M&#8242;OF4.







Abstract
The NgF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;MOF4 (Ng=Kr, Xe; M=Mo, W) and XeF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2MOF4 complexes were synthesized in anhydrous HF (aHF) solvent and melts, respectively. Their single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) structures show NgF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;MOF4 and XeF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2MOF4 have Ft&#8722;Ng&#8722;Fb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;M arrangements, in which the NgF2 ligands coordinate to MOF4 through Ng&#8722;Fb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;M bridges. The XeF2 ligands of XeF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2MOF4 also coordinate to F3OM&#8722;Fb&#8217;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;M'OF4 moieties through Xe&#8722;Fb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;M bridges to form Ft&#8722;Xe&#8722;Fb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;M(OF3)&#8722;Fb&#8217;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;M'OF4, where XeF2 coordinates trans to the M=O bond and Fb&#8217; coordinates trans to the M&#8217;=O bond. The Ng&#8722;Ft, Ng&#8722;Fb, and M&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;Fb bond lengths of NgF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;nMOF4 are consistent with MOF4 and F3OM&#8722;Fb&#8217;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;M'OF4 fluoride&#8208;ion affinity trends: CrOF4&lt;MoOF4&lt;WOF4&#8776;F3OMo&#8722;Fb&#8217;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;Mo'OF4&lt;F3OW&#8722;Fb&#8217;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;W'OF4. The [&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;(F4OMo)(&#956;3&#8208;F)H&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;F)H&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;]&#8734; and [H3F2][W2O2F9] solvates were also synthesized in aHF and characterized by SCXRD. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations show the M&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;Fb bonds of NgF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;MOF4 and XeF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2MOF4 are predominantly electrostatic, &#963;&#8208;hole type bonds.

The impact of clickable side chains and click adducts on heterochiral DNA with complementary strands in the &#945;&#8208;d and &#946;&#8208;d configurations and their homochiral counterparts with both strands in the &#945;&#8208;d or &#946;&#8208;d configuration is investigated. For this, the &#945;&#8208;anomers of 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridine and 7&#8208;deaza&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine were synthesized, converted to phosphoramidites, and employed in solid&#8208;phase oligonucleotide synthesis. Functionalized &#945;/&#945; DNAs are much more stable than their &#945;/&#946; and &#946;/&#946; counterparts. This finding expands the toolbox of nucleic acid applications beyond canonical DNA.







Abstract
Anomeric base pairs in heterochiral DNA with strands in the &#945;&#8208;d and &#946;&#8208;d configurations and homochiral DNA with both strands in &#945;&#8208;d configuration were functionalized. The &#945;&#8208;d anomers of 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridine and 7&#8208;deaza&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine were synthesized and functionalized with clickable octadiynyl side chains. Nucleosides were protected and converted to phosphoramidites. Solid&#8208;phase synthesis furnished 12&#8208;mer oligonucleotides, which were hybridized. Pyrene click adducts display fluorescence, a few of them with excimer emission. Tm values and thermodynamic data revealed the following order of duplex stability &#945;/&#945;&#8208;d&#8811;&#946;/&#946;&#8208;d&#8805;&#945;/&#946;&#8208;d. CD spectra disclosed that conformational changes occur during hybridization. Functionalized DNAs were modeled and energy minimized. Clickable side chains and bulky click adducts are well accommodated in the grooves of anomeric DNA. The investigation shows for the first time that anomeric DNAs can be functionalized in the same way as canonical DNA for potential applications in nucleic acid chemistry, chemical biology, and DNA material science.

         <title>Electronic circular dichroism&#8208;circularly polarized Raman (eCP&#8208;Raman): a new form of chiral Raman spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We summarize recent works on the discovery of a new form of chiral Raman spectroscopy,  e  CP&#8208;Raman, which combines two spectroscopies: electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and circularly polarized Raman (CP&#8208;Raman). First, some puzzling observations while carrying out Raman optical activity (ROA) measurements of several transition metal complexes under resonance are described, as well as the search for the mechanisms responsible. Then an equation for quantifying the  e  CP&#8208;Raman contribution is presented, followed by several examples of how  e  CP&#8208;Raman influences  the  I  R  &#8211; I  L  spectra of achiral and chiral solvent molecules and of a number of chiral solutes under resonance. The conditions to extract resonance ROA, when the  e  CP&#8208;Raman contribution is minimized, are also discussed. Finally, we comment on the potential applications of  e  CP&#8208;Raman.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalized Graphene Quantum Dots Modified Dioxin&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks for Superior Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic framework, as an emerging porous nano&#8208;frame structure with pre&#8208;designed structure and custom properties, has been demonstrated as a prospective electrode for rechargeable Li&#8208;ion batteries. For improving the reversible capacity and long&#8208;term cycle stability of COF materials, we propose a GQDs modified COF material (COF&#8208;GQDs) and apply it as the anode for LIBs for the first time. This COF&#8208;GQDs electrode delivers enhanced long&#8208;term cycling performance with a large capacity of ~820 mAh g  &#8208;1  after 300 cycles of at 100 mA g  &#8208;1  and the improved rate performance. The enhanced lithium&#8208;storage performance, in terms of obvious&#8208;shortened activation process and high reversible capacities, can be attributed to the modification of carboxyl GQDs, which would activate more active sites (activated C=C groups from benzene rings) for lithium&#8208;storage, and provide fast lithium&#8208;ion transportation kinetic. Besides, the decreased interphase resistance, enhanced electronic conductivity, and prevented aggregation of needle&#8208;flake COF structure, originated from the addition of GQDs, lead to the enhanced improved cycling stability of COF&#8208;GQDs electrode. This manuscript can promote the further exploration on the design of COF&#8208;related materials with modification of functionalized carbonaceous materials to achieve the enhanced lithium&#8208;storage properties for next&#8208;generation energy storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure and Interaction Based Design of Anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Aptamers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aptamer selection against novel infections is a complicated and time&#8208;consuming approach. Synergy can be achieved by using computational methods together with experimental procedures. This study aims to develop a reliable methodology for a rational aptamer  in silico  et vitro  design. The new approach combines multiple steps: (1) Molecular design, based on screening in a DNA aptamer library and directed mutagenesis to fit the protein tertiary structure; (2) 3D molecular modeling of the target; (3) Molecular docking of an aptamer with the protein; (4) Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the complexes; (5) Quantum&#8208;mechanical (QM) evaluation of the interactions between aptamer and target with further analysis; (6) Experimental verification at each cycle for structure and binding affinity using small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, cytometry, and fluorescence polarization. Using a new iterative design procedure, Interaction Based Drug Design (SIBDD), a highly specific aptamer to the receptor&#8208;binding domain of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein, was developed and validated.
The SIBDD approach enhances speed of the high&#8208;affinity aptamers development from scratch, using a target protein structure. The method could be used to improve existing aptamers for stronger binding. This approach brings to an advanced level the development of novel affinity probes, functional nucleic acids. It offers a blueprint for the straightforward design of targeting molecules for new pathogen agents and emerging variants.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Reactivity and Structural Properties of Trifluoromethylphosphoranides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphoranides are interesting hypervalent species which serve as model compounds for intermediates or transition states in nucleophilic substitution reactions at trivalent phosphorus substrates. Herein, we report on the syntheses and properties of stable trifluoromethylphosphoranide salts. [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][P(CF  3  )  4  ], [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][P(CF  3  )  3  F], and [NMe  4  ][P(CF  3  )  2  F  2  ] were obtained by treatment of trivalent precursors with sources of CF  3  &#8722;  or F  &#8722;  units. These [P(CF  3  )  4&#8208;n  F  n  ]  &#8722;  (n = 0&#8208;2) salts exhibit fluorinating (n = 1&#8208;2) or trifluoromethylating (n = 0) properties, which is disclosed by studying their reactivity towards selected electrophiles. The solid&#8208;state structures of [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][P(CF  3  )  4  ] and [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][P(CF  3  )  3  F] are ascertained by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The dynamics of these compounds are investigated by variable temperature NMR spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Polymers with Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A summary of recent progress aims at the achievements of efficient room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence emission with stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior. The stimuli&#8208;responsive factors are composed of light, oxygen, temperature, mechanical force and pH. The relationship between luminescent property and stimuli&#8208;responsive mechanism is discussed in detail, and promising opportunities and existing challenges are presented as a guideline for future research in this area.







Abstract
Taking advantages of the impressing behaviors of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), the explorations in RTP materials are not only limited to efficient emission and ultralong lifetime of phosphorescence. The discovery and creation of stimuli&#8208;responsive properties have become the major pursuit, which will lay a solid foundation for future applications in RTP materials. Based on this, a review centered on recent progress of stimuli&#8208;responsive RTP materials is summarized to show frontier development in polymer systems. Different kinds of stimuli&#8208;responsive factors including light, oxygen, temperature, mechanical force and pH regulations are investigated in this review. Many potential applications and promising strategies are deeply discussed with the hope to assist future studies in this area.

         <title>An Increment System to Predict the Effect of Different London Dispersion Donors in all&#8208;meta Substituted Azobenzenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For many chemical phenomena predictive models based on increment systems exist allowing an easy prediction. Despite its low magnitude in isolated systems London dispersion interaction are ubiquitous in manifold situation ranging from solvation to catalysis or in biological systems. Based on our azobenzene system we systematically determined the London dispersion donor strength of different alkyl substituents ranging from Me, Et,  i  Pr up to  t  Bu. Based on this data we were able to implement an increment system for London dispersion for this azobenzene scheme. We propose an equation, which allows to predict the effect of change of substituents on London dispersion interactions in this arrangement which has to be validated in similar molecular arrangements in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural and Electronic Properties of Boranes Containing Boron&#8208;Chalcogen Multiple Bonds and Stabilized by&#160;Amido Imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;imine Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stabilization of elusive monomeric species containing multiple boron&#8208;chalcogen bonds has motivated the investigation of sophisticated ligand systems in the past few years. Recently, a series of neutral, Lewis acid&#8208;free chalcogenboranes were prepared by incorporation of an amido imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;imine as the supporting ligand (  Frank et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2021, 60, 4633  ), resulting in well&#8208;defined molecular entities with pronounced multiple bond character, B=X (X = O, S, Se, Te). In view of the potential use of N&#8208;heterocyclic boranes (NHB=X) as ligands in catalysis and fine chemistry, we evaluated in this work the bonding properties of the new B=X compounds based on a&#160;&#960;&#8208;backdonation model. The electronic properties of systems in question were modulated via systematic modifications of the NHB ring with respect to ligand variation, saturation, size, and heteroatom substitutions. Investigations on the B=X bond length and order, calculated by means of density functional theory methods, reveal enhanced B=X bonding properties for NHB rings with high electron delocalization in the NHB ring and bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents; a fact that was also confirmed by computational assessment of electron interactions of the B=X species with a dicarbonyl manganese complex. We expect that the analysis will contribute to the rational optimization of existing ligands as well as the development of new moieties, which would further allow for exploration of new boron chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Add a Pinch of Tetrel: The Transformation of a Centrosymmetric Metal into a Nonsymmorphic and Chiral Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The substitution of a small amount of silicon to the known composition of RhP3 (centrosymmetric space group Im
) yields novel RhSi0.3P2.7 (space group P212121) which has a noncentrosymmetric, nonsymmorphic, and chiral crystal structure. We hypothesize that a combination of M&#8722;Tt and M&#8722;Pn bonding favors noncentrosymmetric structures. Therefore, by adding a &#8220;pinch&#8221; of tetrel to known centrosymmetric metal pnictide compositions, new noncentrosymmetric structures may be realized.







Abstract
Centrosymmetric skutterudite RhP3 was converted to a nonsymmorphic and chiral compound RhSi0.3P2.7 (space group P212121) by means of partial replacement of Si for P. The structure, determined by a combination of X&#8208;ray crystallography and solid state 31P&#8197;NMR, exhibits branched polyanionic P/Si chains that are unique among metal phosphides. A driving force to stabilize the locally noncentrosymmetric cis&#8208;RhSi2P4 and fac&#8208;RhSi3P3 fragments is &#960;&#8208;electron back&#8208;donation between the Rh t2g&#8208;type orbitals and the unoccupied antibonding Si/P orbitals, which is more effective for Si than for P. In situ studies and total energy calculations revealed the metastable nature of RhSi0.3P2.7. Electronic structure calculations predicted centrosymmetric cubic RhP3 to be metallic which was confirmed by transport properties measurements. In contrast, the electronic structure for chiral orthorhombic RhSi0.3P2.7 contained a bandgap, and this compound was shown to be a narrow gap semiconductor.

         <title>Spin States, Bonding and Magnetism in Mixed&#8208;Valence Iron(0)&#8208;Iron(II) Complexes**
</title>

         <dc:description>
The nature of metal&#8208;metal bonding between two different kinds of metal sites is essential for understanding these &#8220;xenophilic&#8221; complexes. We used M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, SQUID magnetometry and computational analysis on a pair of related diiron complexes; they indicated that the bond order is roughly one&#8208;half. The best electronic structure description is LFeII&#8722;Fe0(CO)2Cp, in which the Fe(CO)2Cp is low&#8208;spin iron(0) and acts as an X&#8208;type ligand toward the high&#8208;spin iron(II) of the LFe fragment.







Abstract
&#8220;Xenophilic&#8221; complexes offer metal&#8208;metal bonds between disparate metal sites, but the nature of the metal&#8208;metal bonding is often unclear. Here, we describe two novel complexes with unsupported Fe&#8722;Fe bonds, LxFe&#8722;Fp (LX = &#946;&#8208;aldiminate or &#946;&#8208;diketiminate; Fp = Fe(CO)2Cp), that offer insight into Fe&#8722;Fe bonding. M&#246;ssbauer, magnetism, and DFT analysis indicate that the most accurate electronic structure description is LFeII&#8592;Fe0(CO)2Cp, in which the Fe(CO)2Cp is low&#8208;spin iron(0) and acts as an X&#8208;type ligand toward the high&#8208;spin iron(II) of the LFe fragment. This largely electrostatic interaction has a bond order of only 0.5. The three&#8208;coordinate high&#8208;spin iron(II) site has large zero&#8208;field splitting, and in addition its M&#246;ssbauer parameters can be used to rank the Fp&#8722; &#8220;metalloligand&#8221; as a donor; it is nearly as strong a donor as phosphides and alkyls.

         <title>Doubly&#8208;Reduced Pentacene in Different Coordination Environments: X&#8208;ray Crystallographic and Theoretical Insights into Structural and Electronic Changes</title>

         <dc:description>
Chemical reduction of pentacene with alkali metals ranging from Li to Cs readily affords the doubly&#8208;reduced anion that shows different binding preference for the lightest Li+ ion vs. heavier Group 1 congeners. DFT calculations provide full support for the X&#8208;ray crystallographic data by following changes in aromaticity and electronic structure of pentacene upon reduction.







Abstract
Chemical reduction of pentacene (C22H14, 1) with Group 1 metals ranging from Li to Cs revealed that 1 readily undergoes a two&#8208;fold reduction to afford a doubly&#8208;reduced 12&#8722; anion in THF. With the help of 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 ether used as a secondary coordinating agent, five &#960;&#8208;complexes of 12&#8722; with different alkali metal counterions have been isolated and fully characterized. This series of complexes enables the first evaluation of alkali&#8208;metal ion binding patterns and structural changes of the 12&#8722; dianion based on the crystallographically confirmed examples. The difference in coordination of the smallest Li+ ion vs. heavier Group 1 congeners has been demonstrated. In addition, the use of benzo&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 in the reaction of 1 with Na metal allowed the isolation of the unique solvent&#8208;separated ion product with a &#8220;naked&#8221; dianion, 12&#8722;. The detailed structural analyses of the series revealed the C&#8722;C bond alteration and core deformation of pentacene upon two&#8208;fold reduction and complexation. The negative charge localization at the central six&#8208;membered ring of 12&#8722; identified by theoretical calculations corroborates with the X&#8208;ray crystallographic results. Subsequent in&#8208;depth theoretical analysis provided a detailed description of changes in the electronic structure and aromaticity of pentacene upon reduction.

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Amino&#8208;iso&#8208;Butyric Acid Foldamers Terminated with Rhodium(I) N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysts</title>

Another twist: &#945;&#8208;Amino&#8208;iso&#8208;butyric acid foldamers terminated with rhodium(I) N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complexes have been shown to possess point, helical and axial chirality. Communication from chiral residues at the N&#8208;termini of these 1&#8197;nm long foldamers to rhodium(I) complexes at the C&#8208;termini led to unequal ratios of diastereoisomers, although this did not alter the stereoselectivity of hydrosilylation reactions catalyzed by these foldamers.







Abstract
To investigate how remotely induced changes in ligand folding might affect catalysis by organometallic complexes, dynamic &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;iso&#8208;butyric acid (Aib) peptide foldamers bearing rhodium(I) N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes have been synthesized and studied. X&#8208;ray crystallography of a foldamer with an N&#8208;terminal azide and a C&#8208;terminal Rh(NHC)(Cl)(diene) complex showed a racemate with a chiral axis in the Rh(NHC) complex and a distorted 310 helical body. Replacing the azide with either one or two chiral L&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methylvaline (L&#8208;&#945;MeVal) residues gave diastereoisomeric foldamers that each possessed point, helical and axial chirality. NMR spectroscopy revealed an unequal ratio of diastereoisomers for some foldamers, indicating that the chiral conformational preference of the N&#8208;terminal residue(s) was relayed down the 1&#8197;nm helical body to the axially chiral Rh(NHC) complex. Although the remote chiral residue(s) did not affect the stereoselectivity of hydrosilylation reactions catalysed by these foldamers, these studies suggest a potential pathway towards remote conformational control of organometallic catalysts.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) possess evenly dispersed atomic active centers and well&#8208;defined coordination structure, which provide high enzyme catalytic activity, and clear experimental model for mechanism study. Hence, the enhanced antitumor therapeutic approaches by utilizing tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive enzyme activities of SAzymes are revealed. And the corresponding therapeutic mechanisms are also analyzed.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) with specific response to the unique tumor microenvironment (TME) feature providing 100&#8201;% metal atoms utilization for high&#8208;efficient enzyme&#8208;catalyzed therapy and accurate template for the study of therapeutic mechanisms. In this review, we first introduce the various synthetic strategies of SAzymes, and the TME&#8208;responsive SAzymes activities. Next, the TME&#8208;responsive enhanced antitumor therapeutic approaches based on the enzymatic activities of SAzymes are summarized, and the corresponding therapy mechanisms are elaborated. Subsequently, a concise but concentrated summary, and the challenges and opportunities for the future design and engineering of SAzyme are outlined. As a new discipline, SAzymes have vast space for development in enhanced antitumor therapy. This timely review provides guidance and constructive suggestions for the future of SAzymes.

         <title>Tuning Peptide Structure and Function through Fluorobenzene Stapling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalyst&#8208;free peptide stapling method based on SNAr reactions of fluorobenzene derivatives led to a library of constrained cyclic peptides with a controlled ortho, meta or para relationship between two cysteine residues. The method is compatible with solid&#8208;phase synthesis by which a single linear peptide can be cyclized with different degrees of constraint. New potent agonists of melanocortin receptors were synthesized by using this method, and the effect of the cyclization on the secondary structure was studied by NMR and CD spectroscopy.







Abstract
Cyclic peptides are promising next&#8208;generation therapeutics with improved biological stability and activity. A catalyst&#8208;free stapling method for cysteine&#8208;containing peptides has been developed that enables fine&#8208;tuning of the macrocycle by using the appropriate regioisomers of fluorobenzene linkers. Stapling was performed on the unprotected linear peptide or, more conveniently, directly on&#8208;resin after peptide synthesis. NMR spectroscopy and circular dichroism studies demonstrate that the type of stapling can tune the secondary structures of the peptides. The method was applied to a set of potential agonists for melanocortin receptors, generating a library of macrocyclic potent ligands with ortho, meta or para relationships between the thioethers. Their small but significant differences in potency and efficacy demonstrate how the method allows facile fine&#8208;tuning of macrocyclic peptides towards biological targets from the same linear precursor.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Leading to White Light Emission in Diphenylbenzofulvene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Even though the aggregation&#8208;induced emission phenomena have been described for diphenylbenzofulvene derivatives for about 15&#8197;years, their solid&#8208;state emission in films has not been previously studied. Hereby, their solid&#8208;state emission is characterized and the white light emission of a thin film made of mixture of the derivatives DPBFMe and DPMF(Me)2 is deciphered.







Abstract
The search for a unique molecular system able to efficiently emit in the total visible range of the electromagnetic spectra, i.&#8201;e., white light emission (WLE), is a topic of intense research. We here show that aggregates formed by diphenylbenzofulvene (DPBF) derivatives are from two to four orders of magnitude more emissive than their monomers. From a simple strategy, involving structural modification of a DPBF propelled shape core, a close match with the pure white light emission coordinates is obtained with a combination of two derivatives in films, with featured solid&#8208;state emission, without involvement of D&#8722;A groups or energy transfer processes.

         <title>MOF&#8208;Stabilized Perfluorinated Palladium Cages Catalyze the Additive&#8208;Free Aerobic Oxidation of Aliphatic Alcohols to Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorinated pyridine&#8208;Pd2+ coordinate cages have been synthesized and characterized with atomic resolution within the channels of a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), and used as catalysts during the aerobic oxidation of aliphatic alcohols to carboxylic acids without any additive. These results illustrate a rare example of stable per&#8208;fluorinated cationic metal complex, with potential implications in the future design of catalytic organometallic complexes.







Abstract
Extremely high electrophilic metal complexes, composed by a metal cation and very electron poor &#963;&#8208;donor ancillary ligands, are expected to be privileged catalysts for oxidation reactions in organic chemistry. However, their low lifetime prevents any use in catalysis. Here we show the synthesis of fluorinated pyridine&#8208;Pd2+ coordinate cages within the channels of an anionic tridimensional metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), and their use as efficient metal catalysts for the aerobic oxidation of aliphatic alcohols to carboxylic acids without any additive. Mechanistic studies strongly support that the MOF&#8208;stabilized coordination cage with perfluorinated ligands unleashes the full electrophilic potential of Pd2+ to dehydrogenate primary alcohols, without any base, and also to activate O2 for the radical oxidation to the aldehyde intermediate. This study opens the door to design catalytic perfluorinated complexes for challenging organic transformations, where an extremely high electrophilic metal site is required.

         <title>Molecular Design Strategy for Orange Red Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters in Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes (OLEDs)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this comprehensive review, orange red thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters are discussed in detail based on various molecular designs. The heteroaromatic&#8208;type emitters possessing high rigid core reveal better efficiency enhancement compared to low rigid cores. Moreover, this review focuses on how to achieve high color purity in orange red emitters while maintaining good OLED device performances.







Abstract
Pure organic molecules based thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters have been successfully developed in recent years for their propitious application in highly efficient organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). In the case of orange red emitters, the non&#8208;radiative process is known to be a serious issue due to its lower lying singlet energy level. However, recent studies indicate that there are tremendous efforts put to develop efficient orange red TADF emitters. In addition, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of heteroaromatic based orange red TADF OLEDs surpassed 30&#8201;%. Such heteroaromatic type emitters showed wide emission spectra; therefore, more attention is being paid to develop highly efficient orange red TADF emitters along with good color purity. Herein, the recent progress of orange red TADF emitters based on molecular structures, such as cyanobenzene, heteroaromatic, naphthalimide, and boron&#8208;based acceptors, are reviewed. Further, our insight on these acceptors has been provided by their photophysical studies and device performances. Future perspectives of orange red TADF emitters for real practical applications are discussed.

         <title>Chemically Synthesized, Self&#8208;Assembling Small Interfering RNA&#8208;Prohead RNA Molecules Trigger Dicer&#8208;Independent Gene Silencing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chimeric molecules fusing small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes to prohead RNA (pRNA) three&#8208;way junctions (3WJs) were designed. The siRNA&#8208;3WJs self&#8208;assembled in&#8197;vitro. siRNA&#8208;3WJs transfected into Dicer&#8208;deficient cell lines triggered potent gene silencing. siRNA&#8208;3WJs are most efficient when the antisense strand of the siRNA duplex is positioned 5&#8242; of the 3WJ (5&#8242;&#8208;siRNA&#8208;3WJ) relative to 3&#8242; of the 3WJ (3&#8242;&#8208;siRNA&#8208;3WJ).







Abstract
RNA interference (RNAi) mediated by small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes is a powerful therapeutic modality, but the translation of siRNAs from the bench into clinical application has been hampered by inefficient delivery in&#8197;vivo. An innovative delivery strategy involves fusing siRNAs to a three&#8208;way junction (3WJ) motif derived from the phi29 bacteriophage prohead RNA (pRNA). Chimeric siRNA&#8208;3WJ molecules are presumed to enter the RNAi pathway through Dicer cleavage. Here, we fused siRNAs to the phi29 3WJ and two phylogenetically related 3WJs. We confirmed that the siRNA&#8208;3WJs are substrates for Dicer in&#8197;vitro. However, our results reveal that siRNA&#8208;3WJs transfected into Dicer&#8208;deficient cell lines trigger potent gene silencing. Interestingly, siRNA&#8208;3WJs transfected into an Argonaute 2&#8208;deficient cell line also retain some gene silencing activity. siRNA&#8208;3WJs are most efficient when the antisense strand of the siRNA duplex is positioned 5&#8242; of the 3WJ (5&#8242;&#8208;siRNA&#8208;3WJ) relative to 3&#8242; of the 3WJ (3&#8242;&#8208;siRNA&#8208;3WJ). This work sheds light on the functional properties of siRNA&#8208;3WJs and offers a design rule for maximizing their potency in the human RNAi pathway.

         <title>Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry Imaging: A New Tool to See through Nanoscale Particles in Biological Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoscale particles (NPs) are ubiquitous in our daily life, ranging from ambient particulate matter, microplastics to theranostic nanoparticles. Recent research endeavors in laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (LDI&#8208;MSI) have enriched the toolbox for evaluation of NPs&#8217; behaviors in biological tissues. Practical applications of LDI MSI for NPs have been verified in sub&#8208;organ bio&#8208;distribution, drug release evaluation and surface chemical analysis. Here we summarized previous studies in anticipation of more innovations in this field.







Abstract
Understanding the fate of nanoscale particles (NPs) in biological systems is significant with the increasing risk for human exposure. Recent research endeavors in laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (LDI&#8208;MSI) have enriched the toolbox for evaluation of NPs&#8217; behavior in biological tissues, especially in aspects including sub&#8208;organ bio&#8208;distribution, clearance, quantification and surface chemistry variation analysis. In recognition of the potential for advancement in LDI MSI, this concept provides a brief overview of recent research works in LDI MSI for NPs, illustrates new applications that demonstrate the superiority of this technique, and highlights a series of perspectives and directions to move the field forward.

         <title>Cu2O/CeO2 Photo&#8208;electrochemical Water Splitting: A Nanocomposite with an Efficient Interfacial Transmission Path under the Co&#8208;action of a p&#8211;n Heterojunction and Micro&#8208;mesocrystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Improving your PECs: A Cu2O/CeO2 composite with a unique structure has been fabricated, in which a p&#8211;n heterojunction and a micro&#8208;mesocrystal (m&#8208;MC) structure work together. Under their synergistic effect, an optimal Cu2O/CeO2 photocathode provides a decisive pathway for the rapid separation and transfer of electron&#8211;holes, thereby facilitating the separation/transfer of carriers. As a result, the optimal Cu2O/CeO2 shows the best photo&#8208;electrochemical (PEC) water splitting performance and excellent stability.







Abstract
Cu2O is an ideal p&#8208;type material for photo&#8208;electrochemical (PEC) hydrogen evolution, although serious electron&#8211;hole recombination and photocorrosion restrict its further improvement for PEC activity. In this work, CeO2 nanoparticles (NPs) self&#8208;assemble on the surface of Cu2O octahedra, thus successfully forming a Cu2O/CeO2 structure in which p&#8211;n heterojunctions and micro&#8208;mesocrystals (m&#8208;MCs) work together. The optimum Cu2O/CeO2 composite, without the use of any cocatalyst, exhibits a fivefold higher photocurrent density (4.63&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0&#8197;V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode) than that of Cu2O octahedra, which is better than most Cu2O&#8208;based photocathodes without cocatalyst and even comparable with advanced Cu2O&#8208;based photocathodes. The hydrogen production of the optimal Cu2O/CeO2 (Faradaic efficiency of &#8764;100&#8201;%) is 17.5&#8197;times higher than that of pure Cu2O octahedra, and the photocurrent shows almost no decay under the 12&#8197;h stability test. The delicately designed Cu2O/CeO2 structure in this work provides reference and inspiration for the design of cathodes materials.

         <title>Light&#8208;Assisted Ullmann Coupling of Phenols and Aryl Halides: The Synergetic Effect Between Plasmonic Copper Nanoparticles and Carbon Nanotubes from Various Sources</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, plasmonic copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) were loaded onto carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from various sources including commercial CNTs and those directly derived from plastic wastes. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation, the synergetic effect between Cu NPs and CNTs could efficiently promote Ullmann coupling of phenols and aryl halides, achieving high yields of diaryl ethers.







Abstract
Utilizing light and plastic wastes as resources to turn the wasted phenols and hazardous aryl halides into value added chemicals seems to be an attractive idea for alleviating the energy crisis and environmental problems. In this work, plasmonic copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) were loaded onto carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from various sources including commercial CNTs and those derived from plastic wastes. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation, the catalyst could efficiently convert phenols and aryl halides to diaryl ethers. Similar with commercial CNTs, excellent activity is also achieved when utilizing CNTs derived from different kinds of plastic wastes as support for the system. Further investigation shows that the visible&#8208;light irradiation and light&#8208;excited plasmonic Cu NPs are necessary to inhibit the phenol degradation on CNTs and in turn promote the cross&#8208;coupling of phenol and aryl halides. Compared with metal oxides and other carbon materials, the excellent capability of CNTs to absorb light, to convert light to heat, and to adsorb both two reactants simultaneously are critical to enhance the activity of Cu NPs, achieving high yields of diaryl ethers. This study could provide a novel strategy for catalyst design and generate a more economically sustainable process.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Mediated Glycosylation with Thioglycosides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methods for thioglycoside activation that rely on transition metal catalysis is summarized in this review.







Abstract
Thioglycosides are among the most common glycosyl donors that find broad application in the synthesis of glycans and glycoconjugates. However, the requirement for toxic and/or large access of activators needed for common glycosylations with thioglycosides remains a notable drawback. Due to the increased awareness of the chemical waste impact on the environment, synthetic studies have been driven by the goal of finding non&#8208;toxic reagents. The main focus of this review is to highlight recent methods for thioglycoside activation that rely on transition metal catalysis.

IF2.&#8722;Li+, which is featuring a unique semiconductor. Compound IF.&#8722;K+(18&#8208;c&#8208;6) is a 1D magnetic chain; [IF.&#8722;K+(15&#8208;c&#8208;5)]2 is a radical anionic dimer with an open&#8208;shell ground state; and IF.&#8722;Na+(15&#8208;c&#8208;5) and IF.&#8722;K+(cryptand) are monoradical anion salts.







Abstract
The one&#8208;electron reduction of indeno[2,1&#8208;a]fluorene&#8208;11,12&#8208;dione (IF) with various alkali metals prepare the radical anion salts. The data about different structures, properties, and characterization was obtained by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurements, and physical property measurement system (PPMS). Compound IF.&#8722;K+(18&#8208;c&#8208;6) is regarded as a one&#8208;dimensional magnetic chain through C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C interaction. Theoretical calculations and magnetic results showed that [IF.&#8722;K+(15&#8208;c&#8208;5)]2 is a dimer with an open&#8208;shell ground state. Compounds IF.&#8722;Na+(15&#8208;c&#8208;5) and IF.&#8722;K+(cryptand) are monoradical anion salts: IF2.&#8722;Li+ possesses unique &#960;&#8208;stack structure with an interplanar separation less than 3.46&#8197;&#197;, making it a semiconductor (&#948;RT=1.9&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;1). This work gives insights into multifunctional radical anions, and describes the design and development of different functional radicals.

         <title>Tunable Surface Electric Field of Electrocatalysts via Constructing Schottky Heterojunctions for Selective Conversion of Trash Ions to Treasures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conceptually new method is proposed to tune the surface electric field of electrocatalysts by adjusting the number and density of heterojunctions inside. The well&#8208;designed surface electric field of an electrocatalyst plays a key role in facilitating pre&#8208;adsorption and/or activation of reactants for selective conversion of trash ions to useful products.







Abstract
Surface electric field of catalyst is widely recognized as one of the key points to boost catalytic activity. However, there is still a lack of convenient ways to tune the surface electric field to selectively boost the catalytic conversions of different types of reactants in specific catalytic reactions. Here, we introduce a conceptually new method to tune the surface electric field of electrode materials by adjusting the number and density of heterojunctions inside. Both theoretical and experimental results prove that the well&#8208;designed surface electric field of an electrocatalyst plays a key role in facilitating pre&#8208;adsorption and/or activation of reactants for selective conversion of trash ions to useful products in hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions as well as NOx&#8722; reduction reactions.

         <title>Pd(II)&#8208;Mediated C&#8722;H Activation for Cysteine Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Out of the box: A highly efficient bioconjugation strategy is reported utilising Pd(II) complexes prepared via C&#8722;H activation, which enable selective S&#8208;arylation of cysteine. These C&#8722;H activation complexes were prepared using common Pd(II) sources and without the need for a glovebox. A wide substrate scope is enabled by in&#8197;situ generation of these complexes, which produce excellent conversions of a model tripeptide and are able to arylate surface cysteine on an intact protein.







Abstract
Selective bioconjugation remains a significant challenge for the synthetic chemist due to the stringent reaction conditions required by biomolecules coupled with their high degree of functionality. The current trailblazer of transition&#8208;metal mediated bioconjugation chemistry involves the use of Pd(II) complexes prepared via an oxidative addition process. Herein, the preparation of Pd(II) complexes for cysteine bioconjugation via a facile C&#8722;H activation process is reported. These complexes show bioconjugation efficiency competitive with what is seen in the current literature, with a user&#8208;friendly synthesis, common Pd(II) sources, and a more cost&#8208;effective ligand. Furthermore, these complexes need not be isolated, and still achieve high conversion efficiency and selectivity of a model peptide. These complexes also demonstrate the ability to selectively arylate a single surface cysteine residue on a model protein substrate, further demonstrating their utility.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Out of the box&lt;/b&gt;: A highly efficient bioconjugation strategy is reported utilising Pd(II) complexes prepared via C&#8722;H activation, which enable selective &lt;i&gt;S-&lt;/i&gt;arylation of cysteine. These C&#8722;H activation complexes were prepared using common Pd(II) sources and without the need for a glovebox. A wide substrate scope is enabled by in&#8197;situ generation of these complexes, which produce excellent conversions of a model tripeptide and are able to arylate surface cysteine on an intact protein.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selective bioconjugation remains a significant challenge for the synthetic chemist due to the stringent reaction conditions required by biomolecules coupled with their high degree of functionality. The current trailblazer of transition-metal mediated bioconjugation chemistry involves the use of Pd(II) complexes prepared via an oxidative addition process. Herein, the preparation of Pd(II) complexes for cysteine bioconjugation via a facile C&#8722;H activation process is reported. These complexes show bioconjugation efficiency competitive with what is seen in the current literature, with a user-friendly synthesis, common Pd(II) sources, and a more cost-effective ligand. Furthermore, these complexes need not be isolated, and still achieve high conversion efficiency and selectivity of a model peptide. These complexes also demonstrate the ability to selectively arylate a single surface cysteine residue on a model protein substrate, further demonstrating their utility.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
para&#8208;Alkynylated aromatic amines are obtained without the need to prefunctionalize the starting aniline by Pd/S,O&#8208;ligand catalyzed C&#8722;H alkynylation reactions.







Abstract
Herein, we report a nondirected para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H alkynylation of aniline derivatives by a Pd/S,O&#8208;ligand&#8208;based catalyst. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions and is compatible with a variety of substituted anilines. The scalability and further derivatizations of the alkynylated products have been also demonstrated.

A simple, radially arranged, highly anthracene congested 1,2,3&#8208;tri(9&#8208;anthryl)benzene has been synthesized in a Negishi coupling reaction with a PdI catalyst. This beautiful three&#8208;anthracene clustered structure shows unique behavior in both the solid and excited states, but work is still in progress. There are three more anthracenes on the wooden desk for construction of the final target: hexa(9&#8208;anthryl)benzene. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Nishiuchi, H. Sotome, K. Shimizu, H. Miyasaka, and T. Kubo (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104245).

         <title>BOPHY&#8208;Fullerene C60 Dyad as a Photosensitizer for Antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free BOPHY&#8208;based photosensitizer (PS) has been obtained as a mixture of two atropisomers. The BOPHY core works as a visible light&#8208;harvesting center and donor antenna, while a fullerene C60 acceptor acts as an effective spin converter and triggers photodynamic action. The dyad is capable of producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) by both photodynamic mechanisms. In&#8208;vitro studies indicate that the dyad photokills microorganisms after visible light irradiation. More information can be found in the Research Article by D.&#8197;A. Heredia et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103884).

         <title>Spectroscopic and Crystallographic Characterization of the R3N+&#8722;C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X Interaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite recent studies that have demonstrated the importance of R3N+&#8722;C&#8722;H hydrogen bonds in synthesis, biology and medicine, these noncovalent interactions remain undercharacterized. Herein, we present crystallographic, computational and for the first time, spectroscopic evidence for these weak hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
As appreciation for nonclassical hydrogen bonds has progressively increased, so have efforts to characterize these interesting interactions. Whereas several kinds of C&#8722;H hydrogen bonds have been well&#8208;studied, much less is known about the R3N+&#8722;C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X variety. Herein, we present crystallographic and spectroscopic evidence for the existence of these interactions, with special relevance to Selectfluor chemistry. Of particular note is the propensity for Lewis bases to engage in nonclassical hydrogen bonding over halogen bonding with the electrophilic F atom of Selectfluor. Further, the first examples of 1H NMR experiments detailing R3N+&#8722;C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X (X=O, N) hydrogen bonds are described.

         <title>Tuning the (Chir)optical Properties and Squeezing out the Inherent Chirality in Polyphenylene&#8208;Locked Helical Carbon Nanorings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Distorting linear polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) out of planarity affects their physical properties and breaks their symmetry to induce inherent chirality. However, the chirality cannot be achieved in large distorted PAHs&#8208;based macrocycles due to low racemization barrier for isomerization. Herein we report the precise synthesis and tuning size&#8208;dependent (chir)optical properties of a new class of chiral PAHs&#8208;containing conjugated macrocycles (cyclo[n]paraphenylene&#8208;2,6&#8208;anthrylene, [n]CPPAn2,6; n = 6&#8208;8). Their inherent chiralities were squeezed out in small anthrylene&#8208;based macrocycles. Efficient resolutions for chiral enantiomers with (P)/(M)&#8208;helicity of small [6&#8208;7]CPPAns were achieved by HPLC. Interestingly, these macrocycles showed enriched size&#8208;dependent physical, chiral, and (chir)optical properties. Theoretical calculations indicate that these macrocycles have high strain energy (Estrain = 60.8 to 73.4 kcal/mol) and very small Egap (~3.0 eV). Notably, these enantiomers showed strong chiroptical properties and dissymmetry factors (|gabs| and |glum| ~0.01 for an enantiomer of [6]CPPAn2,6), which can give them potential applications in optically active materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A phosphine oxide promoted cobalt&#8208;catalysed reductive etherification using syngas as a reductant is reported. This novel methodology was successfully used to prepare a broad scope of unsymmetrical ethers from various aldehydes and alcohols containing diverse functional groups and scaled&#8208;up to multigram scale under comparably mild conditions. Mechanistic experiments support an acetalization&#8209;hydrogenation sequence.</dc:description>

         <title>Cationic Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Decarbonylative Aryl Addition of Aromatic Aldehydes to Bicyclic Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report an unprecedented catalytic protocol for the enantioselective decarbonylative transformation of aryl aldehydes. In this process, the decarbonylation of aldehydes catalyzed by chiral iridium complexes enable the formation of asymmetric C&#8211;C bonds&#160; via &#160;the formation of an aryl&#8208;iridium intermediate. The decarbonylative aryl addition to bicyclic alkenes was fluidly performed without using a stoichiometric aryl&#8208;metal reagent, such as aryl boronic acid, with a cationic iridium complex generated in situ from Ir(cod)2(BArF4) and the sulfur&#8208;linked bis(phosphoramidite) ligand ((R,R)&#8208;S&#8208;Me&#8208;BIPAM). This reaction has broad functional group compatibility, and no waste is generated, except carbon monoxide.</dc:description>

         <title>The Potential of Micellar Media in the Synthesis of DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA&#8208;encoded library (DEL) technology has become widely used in drug discovery research. The construction of DELs require robust organic transformations which proceed in aqueous media under mild conditions. Unfortunately, the application of water as reaction media for organic synthesis is not evident due to generally limited solubility of organic reagents. However, the use of surfactants can offer a solution to this issue. Oil&#8208;in&#8208;water microemulsions formed by surfactant micelles are able localize hydrophobic reagents inside them, resulting in high local concentration of the organic substances in an otherwise poorly solvated environment. This review provides a conceptual and critical summary of micellar synthesis possibilities that are well&#8208;suited for DEL synthesis. Existing examples on micellar DEL approaches, together with a selection of micellar organic transformations fundamentally suitable for DEL are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Inverse&#8208;tunable Red Luminescence and Electronic Properties of Nitridoberylloaluminates Sr2&#8208;xBax[BeAl3N5]:Eu2+ (x = 0&#8722;2)</title>

         <dc:description>The nitridoberylloaluminate Ba  2  [BeAl  3  N  5  ]:Eu  2+  and solid solutions Sr  2&#8722;  x  Ba  x  [BeAl  3  N  5  ]:Eu  2+  (  x  = 0.5, 1.0, 1.5) were synthesized in a hot isostatic press (HIP) under 50 MPa N  2  atmosphere at 1200 &#176;C. Ba  2  [BeAl  3  N  5  ]:Eu  2+  crystallizes in triclinic space group (no. 2) (  Z  = 2,  a  = 6.1869(10),  b  = 7.1736(13),  c  = 8.0391(14) &#197;,  &#945;  = 102.754(8),  &#946;  = 112.032(6),  &#947;  = 104.765(7)&#176;), which was determined from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data. The lattice parameters of the solid solution series have been obtained from Rietveld refinements and show a nearly linear dependence on the atomic ratio Sr:Ba. The electronic properties and the band gaps of  M  2  [BeAl  3  N  5  ] (  M  = Sr, Ba) have been investigated by a combination of soft X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Upon irradiation with blue light (440&#8211;450 nm), the nitridoberylloaluminates exhibit intense orange to red luminescence, which can be tuned between 610 and 656 nm (fwhm = 1922&#8211; 2025 cm  &#8722;1  (72&#8211;87 nm)). In contrast to the usual trend, the substitution of the smaller Sr  2+  by larger Ba  2+  leads to an inversetunable luminescence to higher wavelengths. Low&#8208;temperature luminescence measurements have been performed to exclude anomalous emission.</dc:description>

Depending on the catalyst either none, one or two silyl groups migrate and change their positions in the formed five&#8208;membered rings.

         <dc:description>A new fluorescent ribonucleoside alphabet (  mth  N) consisting of pyrimidines and purines analogues, all derived from methylthieno[3,4&#8208;  d  ]pyrimidine as the heterocyclic core, is described.&#160; Large bathochromic shifts and high microenvironmental susceptibility of their emission relative to previous alphabets derived from thieno[3,4&#8208;  d  ]pyrimidine (  th  N) and isothiazole[4,3&#8208;  d  ]pyrimidine (  tz  N) scaffolds are observed. Subjecting the purine analogues to adenosine deaminase, guanine deaminase and T7 RNA Polymerase indicate that, while varying, all but one enzyme tolerate the corresponding  mth  N/  mth  NTP substrates. The robust emission quantum yields, high photophysical responsiveness and enzymatic accommodation suggest that the  mth  N alphabet is a biophysically viable tool and can be used to probe the tolerance of nucleoside/tide&#8208;processing enzymes to structural perturbations of their substrates.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Boron Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed and catalyst&#8208;free hydroboration reactions of imines are attractive due to the mild reaction conditions. In this work, the mechanistic details of the hydroboration reactions of two different kinds of imine with pinacolborane (HBpin) are investigated by combining density functional theory calculations and experimental studies. For the hydroboration reaction of  N  &#8208;(&#945;&#8208;methylbenzylidene)aniline catalyzed by tris[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borane (BAr  F  3  ), our calculations show that the reaction proceeds through a boron Lewis acid&#8208;promoted hydride transfer mechanism rather than the classical Lewis acid&#8208;activation mechanism. For the catalyst&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free hydroboration reaction of imine,  N  &#8208;benzylideneaniline, our calculations and experimental studies indicate that this reaction is difficult to occur under the reaction conditions reported previously. With a combination of computational and experimental studies, we have established that the commercially available BH  3  &#183;SMe  2  can serve as an efficient catalyst for the hydroboration reaction of  N  &#8208;benzylideneaniline. The hydroboration reaction catalyzed by BH  3  &#183;SMe  2  is most likely to proceed through a hydroboration/B&#8208;H/B&#8208;N &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis pathway, which is very different from that of the reaction catalyzed by BAr  F  3  .</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The triptycene scaffold has been ring&#8208;opened using a retro&#8208;Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8208;type reaction under acidic conditions to give its corresponding anthrone product. 9&#8208;Hydroxytriptycenes and unsubstituted triptycene undergo a ring&#8208;opening reaction under strongly acidic conditions, such as TfOH. An investigation of the substitution effect has revealed that the electron&#8208;donating group on the arene moiety allows the reaction to proceed in the presence of a weaker acid, such as TFA. In addition, the reaction has been successfully applied toward the synthesis of tetracene.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective C&#8208;H Functionalization Reactions under Gold Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective functionalization of ubiquitous C&#8208;H bonds has proven to be promising field as it offers the construction of chiral molecular complexity in a step&#8208; and atom&#8208;economical manner. In recent years, gold has emerged as an attractive contender for catalyzing such reactions. The unique reactivities and selectivities offered by gold catalysts have been exploited to access numerous asymmetric transformations based on gold&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H functionalization processes. Herein, this review critically highlights the major advances and discoveries made in the enantioselective C&#8208;H functionalization under gold catalysis which is accompanied by mechanistic insights at appropriate places.</dc:description>

         <title>Nonaqueous Emulsion Polycondensation enabled by a Self&#8208;Assembled Cage&#8208;like Surfactant</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonaqueous emulsions are crucial for a range of applications based on water&#8208;sensitive systems such as controlled polymerizations requiring anhydrous reaction conditions and the stabilization of readily hydrolyzable reagents or pharmacologically active components. However, defined molecular surfactants to stabilize such nonaqueous emulsions are scarce. We introduce a self&#8208;assembled coordination cage, decorated with cholesterol functionalities, to serve as a molecular surfactant for various oil&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsions of immiscible organic solvents. While the positively charged cage forms the amphiphile&#8217;s polar moiety, the non&#8208;polar cholesterol appendices can bend in a common direction to stabilize the emulsion. Templated by the droplets, polycondensation reactions were carried out to produce microstructured polyurethane and polyurea materials of different particle sizes and morphologies. Further, the amphiphilic cage can encapsulate a guest molecule and the resulting host&#8208;guest assembly was also examined as a surfactant. In addition, the aggregation behavior of the amphiphilic cage in an aqueous medium was examined.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Domino Hydroformylation/Hydrogenation of Olefins to Alcohols: Synergy of Two Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Going to plan: Olefins have been hydroxymethylated by using an iridium catalyst and the synergy of two ligands. DFT calculations provided a chance to develop new catalytic systems before empirical studies were undertaken. Then the iridium&#8208;catalyzed domino hydroformylation/reduction of olefins to alcohols under water&#8211;gas shift reaction conditions was studied as an example. Two different ligands (L1 and L10) applied at the same time improved alcohol yields and verified the computational model.







Abstract
A novel one&#8208;pot iridium&#8208;catalyzed domino hydroxymethylation of olefins, which relies on using two different ligands at the same time, is reported. DFT computation reveals different activities for the individual hydroformylation and hydrogenation steps in the presence of mono&#8208; and bidentate ligands. Whereas bidentate ligands have higher hydrogenation activity, monodentate ligands show higher hydroformylation activity. Accordingly, a catalyst system is introduced that uses dual ligands in the whole domino process. Control experiments show that the overall selectivity is kinetically controlled. Both computation and experiment explain the function of the two optimized ligands during the domino process.

         <title>Competition for Hydride Between Silicon and Boron: Synthesis and Characterization of a Hydroborane&#8208;Stabilized Silylium Ion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silylium against borenium&#8230;who wins when tugging on opposite &#8220;ends&#8221; of hydride? A cationic system based on a naphtalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;diyl platform has been designed for probing the competition for hydride between silicon and boron. The hydroborane&#8208;stabilized silylium ion with a delocalized three&#8208;center, two&#8208;electron B&#8722;H&#8722;Si bond and more silylium than borenium ion character is the winner (see Scheme; [B(C6F5)4]&#8722; omitted for clarity).







Abstract
Potent main&#8208;group Lewis acids are capable of activating element&#8208;hydrogen bonds. To probe the rivalry for hydride between silylium&#8208; and borenium&#8208;ion centers, a neutral precursor with the hydrosilane and hydroborane units in close proximity on a naphthalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;diyl platform was designed. Abstraction of one hydride leads to a hydroborane&#8208;stabilized silylium ion rather than a hydrosilane&#8208;coordinated borenium ion paired with [B(C6F5)4]&#8722; or [HCB11Cl11]&#8722; as counteranions. Characterization by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction supported by DFT calculations reveals a cationic, unsymmetrical open three&#8208;center, two&#8208;electron (3c2e) Si&#8722;H&#8722;B linkage.

&lt;p&gt;Potent main-group Lewis acids are capable of activating element-hydrogen bonds. To probe the rivalry for hydride between silylium- and borenium-ion centers, a neutral precursor with the hydrosilane and hydroborane units in close proximity on a naphthalene-1,8-diyl platform was designed.

Definite role&#8208;sharing and exact cooperation of the functional groups and hydrophobic cavity enable the regio&#8208;specific sulfonyl transfer reaction.







Abstract
Miniature models of acyl&#8208;transfer systems in cells, which were composed by replacing the protein, coenzyme, and substrate with CD, functional group, and CD, respectively, and combining them all together in one, displayed definite role&#8208;sharing and exact cooperation of the functional groups and hydrophobic cavity, and thus enabled the regio&#8208;specific reaction.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Mycinamicin IV as Integral Part of a Collective Approach to Macrolide Antibiotics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Final act: While a &#8220;collective&#8221; total synthesis of complex macrolide antibiotics illustrates the power of catalysis, it also shows that the glycosylation of elaborate targets remains far from routine. The success critically hinged on the development of robust new approaches to the peripheral (di)deoxy sugars and the proper choice amongst a set of only seemingly equivalent promoters.







Abstract
The total synthesis of the 16&#8208;membered macrolide mycinamicin IV is outlined, which complements our previously disclosed, largely catalysis&#8208;based route to the aglycone. This work must also be seen in the context of our recent conquest of aldgamycin N, a related antibiotic featuring a similar core but a distinctly different functionalization pattern. Taken together, these projects prove that the underlying blueprint is integrative and hence qualifies for a collective approach to this prominent class of natural products. In both cases, the final glycosylation phase mandated close attention and was accomplished only after robust de novo syntheses of the (di)deoxy sugars of the desosamine, chalcose, mycinose and aldgarose types had been established. Systematic screening of the glycosidation promoter was also critically important for success.

         <title>Reaching New Biocatalytic Reactivity Using Continuous Flow Reactors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous flow is a mainstay in the synthetic chemist's toolbox. It has also begun to see increasing application in biocatalysis. This manuscript discusses some of the challenges that continuous flow has contributed solutions to for the improvement of biocatalysis. It also poses how the future of continuous flow biocatalysis will change with new technologies such as automation, in&#8208;line analysis and AI.







Abstract
The use of flow reactors in biocatalysis has increased significantly in recent years. Chemists have begun to design flow systems that even allow new biocatalytic reactions to take place. This concept article will focus on the design of flow systems that have allowed enzymes to go beyond their limits in batch. The case is made for moving towards fully continuous systems. With flow chemistry increasingly seen as an enabling technology for automated synthesis, and with advancements in AI&#8208;assisted enzyme design, there is a real possibility to fully automate the development and implementation of a continuous biocatalytic processes. This will lead to significantly improved enzyme processes for synthesis.

         <title>Evidence for Charge Delocalization in Diazafluorene Ligands Supporting Low&#8208;Valent [Cp*Rh] Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ligands based upon the 4,5&#8208;diazafluorene core are an important class of emerging ligands in organometallic chemistry, but the structure and electronic properties of these ligands have received less attention than they deserve. Here, we show that 9,9&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;diazafluorene (Me  2  daf) can stabilize low&#8208;valent complexes through charge delocalization into its conjugated &#960;&#8208;system. Using a new platform of [Cp*Rh] complexes with three accessible formal oxidation states (+III, +II, and +I), we show that the methylation in Me  2  daf is protective, blocking Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;base chemistry commonly encountered with other daf&#8208;based ligands. Electronic absorption spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of a family of eleven new compounds, including the unusual Cp*Rh(Me  2  daf), reveal features consistent with charge delocalization driven by &#960;&#8208;backbonding into the LUMO of Me  2  daf, reminiscent of behavior displayed by the workhorse 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl ligand. Taken together with spectrochemical data demonstrating clean conversion between oxidation states, our findings show that 9,9&#8242;&#8208;dialkylated daf&#8208;type ligands are promising building blocks for applications in reductive chemistry and catalysis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In this combined computational and experimental study, we performed studies on the C&#8208;H functionalization of 2&#8208;phenyl pyridine with diazoalkanes. Initial evaluation by computational methods allowed the evaluation of different metal catalysts and diazoalkanes and their compatibility in this C&#8208;H functionalization reaction. With these findings we were able to then quickly identify suitable reaction conditions for the C&#8208;H methylation reactions using highly reactive TMS diazomethane and C&#8208;H alkylation reactions with donor/acceptor diazoalkanes, which is applied to a broad scope on alkylation reactions of 2&#8208;aryl pyridines with TMS diazomethane and donor/acceptor diazoalkane (51 examples, up to 98% yield).</dc:description>

         <title>A Modular Synthesis of Substituted Cycloparaphenylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report a modular synthesis providing access to substituted cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) of different size. A key synthon introducing two geminal ester units was efficiently prepared via [2+2+2] cycloaddition reaction. This building block can be conveniently converted to macrocyclic precursors controlling the ring size of the final CPP. Efficient reductive aromatization  via  single&#8208;electron transfer provided the substituted nanohoops in a straight&#8208;forward manner. The  t&#8208;  Bu&#8208;ester substitution pattern enables a tube&#8208;like arrangement in the solid&#8208;state governed by van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals interactions exhibiting one of the tightest packings of CPPs in tube&#8208;direction known opening new avenues in crystal design of CPPs.</dc:description>

         <title>Origin of the different reactivity of the high&#8208;valent coinage&#8208;metal complexes [RCuiiiMe3]&#8722; and [RAgiiiMe3]&#8722; (R=allyl)**

Gas&#8208;phase fragmentation experiments reveal a contrasting reactivity of the high&#8208;valent coinage&#8208;metal complexes [RCuiiiMe3]&#8722; and [RAgiiiMe3]&#8722; (R=allyl). Using DFT, coupled&#8208;cluster and multi&#8208;configurational calculations together with kinetic modeling, the reactivity difference is traced back to different C&#8722;C coupling propensities of the two complexes. For [RAgMe3]&#8722;, an outer&#8208;sphere cross&#8208;coupling transition state featuring a large multi&#8208;configurational character plays a key role for the understanding of its reactivity.







Abstract
High&#8208;valent tetraalkylcuprates(iii) and &#8208;argentates(iii) are key intermediates of copper&#8208; and silver&#8208;mediated C&#8722;C coupling reactions. Here, we investigate the previously reported contrasting reactivity of [RMiiiMe3]&#8722; complexes (M=Cu, Ag and R=allyl) with energy&#8208;dependent collision&#8208;induced dissociation experiments, advanced quantum&#8208;chemical calculations and kinetic computations. The gas&#8208;phase fragmentation experiments confirmed the preferred formation of the [RCuMe]&#8722; anion upon collisional activation of the cuprate(iii) species, consistent with a homo&#8208;coupling reaction, whereas the silver analogue primarily yielded [AgMe2]&#8722;, consistent with a cross&#8208;coupling reaction. For both complexes, density functional theory calculations identified one mechanism for homo coupling and four different ones for cross coupling. Of these pathways, an unprecedented concerted outer&#8208;sphere cross coupling is of particular interest, because it can explain the formation of [AgMe2]&#8722; from the argentate(iii) species. Remarkably, the different C&#8722;C coupling propensities of the two [RMiiiMe3]&#8722; complexes become only apparent when properly accounting for the multi&#8208;configurational character of the wave function for the key transition state of [RAgMe3]&#8722;. Backed by the obtained detailed mechanistic insight for the gas&#8208;phase reactions, we propose that the previously observed cross&#8208;coupling reaction of the silver complex in solution proceeds via the outer&#8208;sphere mechanism.

         <title>Combined in silico and in vitro approaches to uncover the oxidation and Schiff base reaction of baicalein as an inhibitor of amyloid protein aggregation.</title>

         <dc:description>The oxidized form of&#160;baicalein&#160;(  BA  )&#160;leads to covalent binding with human amyloid proteins. Such adducts hamper&#160;the aggregation&#160;and deposition of fibrils. A novel reaction of&#160;  BA  &#160;with pentylamine (  PA  ) as a model for the lysine side chain is described. This is the first study addressing&#160;the&#160;atomistic details of a Schiff base reaction with the tri&#8208;hydroxylated moiety of&#160;  BA  .&#160;Nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry approaches&#160;clearly&#160;indicate the formation of dehydrobaicalein in solution as well as its condensation reaction with&#160;  PA  &#160;under aerobic conditions, yielding regioselective C6&#8208;substituted products. The combined results suggest initial ion pair formation between&#160;  BA  &#160;and&#160;  PA  , followed by a redox chain reaction: the initiation by oxygen/air; the&#160;  o  &#8208;quinone&#8208;based chain involving oxidation and reduction steps; and extra off&#8208;chain formation of a doubly oxidized product.&#160;These mechanistic details support the anti&#8208;amyloid activity of&#160;  BA  &#160;and endorse its trihydroxyphenyl&#8208;moiety as a pharmacophore for drug design studies.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report structure elucidation and total synthesis of five unprecedented terpenoid&#8208;alkaloids, the sandacrabins, alongside with the first description of their producing organism  Sandaracinus  defensii  MSr10575, which expands the  Sandaracineae  family by only its second member. The genome sequence of  S. defensii  as presented in this study was utilized to identify enzymes responsible for sandacrabin formation, whereby dimethylbenzimidazol, deriving from cobalamin biosynthesis, was identified as key intermediate. Biological activity profiling revealed that all sandacrabins except congener A exhibit potent antiviral activity against the human pathogenic coronavirus HCoV229E in the three digit nanomolar range. Investigation of the underlying mode of action discloses that the sandacrabins inhibit the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA&#8208;dependent RNA polymerase complex, highlighting them as structurally distinct non&#8208;nucleoside RNA synthesis inhibitors. The observed segregation between cell toxicity at higher concentrations and viral inhibition opens the possibility for their medicinal chemistry optimization towards selective inhibitors.</dc:description>

         <title>Indoloquinoline Ligands Favor Intercalation at Quadruplex&#8208;Duplex Interfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quadruplex&#8208;duplex junctions: A quadruplex&#8208;duplex interface outcompetes an exposed 5&#8217;&#8208;outer tetrad of a parallel quadruplex as favored binding site for indoloquinoline ligands. The ligands intercalate between the G&#8208;tetrad and the neighboring Watson&#8208;Crick base pair located at the interface. High&#8208;affinity binding associated with a large exothermicity is driven by maximizing &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and electrostatic interactions of the positively charged indoloquinoline moiety.







Abstract
Quadruplex&#8208;duplex (Q&#8208;D) junctions are increasingly considered promising targets for medicinal and technological applications. Here, a Q&#8208;D hybrid with a hairpin&#8208;type snapback loop coaxially stacked onto the quadruplex 3&#8217;&#8208;outer tetrad was designed and employed as a target structure for the indoloquinoline ligand SYUIQ&#8208;5. NMR spectral analysis demonstrated high&#8208;affinity binding of the ligand at the quadruplex&#8208;duplex interface with association constants determined by isothermal titration calorimetry of about 107&#8197;M&#8722;1 and large exothermicities &#916;H&#176; of &#8722;14&#8197;kcal/mol in a 120&#8197;mM K+ buffer at 40&#8201;&#176;C. Determination of the ligand&#8208;bound hybrid structure revealed intercalation of SYUIQ&#8208;5 between 3&#8217;&#8208;outer tetrad and the neighboring CG base pair, maximizing &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking as well as electrostatic interactions with guanine carbonyl groups in close vicinity to the positively charged protonated quinoline nitrogen of the tetracyclic indoloquinoline. Exhibiting considerable flexibility, the SYUIQ&#8208;5 sidechain resides in the duplex minor groove. Based on comparative binding studies with the non&#8208;substituted N5&#8208;methylated indoloquinoline cryptolepine, the sidechain is suggested to confer additional affinity and to fix the alignment of the intercalated indoloquinoline aromatic core. However, selectivity for the Q&#8208;D junction mostly relies on the geometry and charge distribution of the indoloquinoline ring system. The presented results are expected to provide valuable guidelines for the design of ligands specifically targeting Q&#8208;D interfaces.

     alt="Indoloquinoline Ligands Favor Intercalation at Quadruplex-Duplex Interfaces"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quadruplex-duplex junctions&lt;/b&gt;: A quadruplex-duplex interface outcompetes an exposed 5&#8217;-outer tetrad of a parallel quadruplex as favored binding site for indoloquinoline ligands. The ligands intercalate between the G-tetrad and the neighboring Watson-Crick base pair located at the interface. High-affinity binding associated with a large exothermicity is driven by maximizing &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and electrostatic interactions of the positively charged indoloquinoline moiety.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quadruplex-duplex (Q-D) junctions are increasingly considered promising targets for medicinal and technological applications. Here, a Q-D hybrid with a hairpin-type snapback loop coaxially stacked onto the quadruplex 3&#8217;-outer tetrad was designed and employed as a target structure for the indoloquinoline ligand SYUIQ-5. NMR spectral analysis demonstrated high-affinity binding of the ligand at the quadruplex-duplex interface with association constants determined by isothermal titration calorimetry of about 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and large exothermicities &#916;&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&#176; of &#8722;14&#8197;kcal/mol in a 120&#8197;mM K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; buffer at 40&#8201;&#176;C. Determination of the ligand-bound hybrid structure revealed intercalation of SYUIQ-5 between 3&#8217;-outer tetrad and the neighboring CG base pair, maximizing &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking as well as electrostatic interactions with guanine carbonyl groups in close vicinity to the positively charged protonated quinoline nitrogen of the tetracyclic indoloquinoline. Exhibiting considerable flexibility, the SYUIQ-5 sidechain resides in the duplex minor groove. Based on comparative binding studies with the non-substituted &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;5-methylated indoloquinoline cryptolepine, the sidechain is suggested to confer additional affinity and to fix the alignment of the intercalated indoloquinoline aromatic core. However, selectivity for the Q-D junction mostly relies on the geometry and charge distribution of the indoloquinoline ring system. The presented results are expected to provide valuable guidelines for the design of ligands specifically targeting Q-D interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biodegradation of Herbicides by a Plant Nonheme Iron Dioxygenase: Mechanism and Selectivity of Substrate Analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Density functional theory calculations show how plant enzymes can initiate the biodegradation of herbicide molecules efficiently. However, the reactivity of substituted substrate analogues is slowed down and in some cases encounters a large rebound barrier.







Abstract
Aryloxyalkanoate dioxygenases are unique herbicide biodegrading nonheme iron enzymes found in plants and hence, from environmental and agricultural point of view they are important and valuable. However, they often are substrate specific and little is known on the details of the mechanism and the substrate scope. To this end, we created enzyme models and calculate the mechanism for 2,4&#8208;dichlorophenoxyacetic acid biodegradation and 2&#8208;methyl substituted analogues by density functional theory. The work shows that the substrate binding is tight and positions the aliphatic group close to the metal center to enable a chemoselective reaction mechanism to form the C2&#8208;hydroxy products, whereas the aromatic hydroxylation barriers are well higher in energy. Subsequently, we investigated the metabolism of R&#8208; and S&#8208;methyl substituted inhibitors and show that these do not react as efficiently as 2,4&#8208;dichlorophenoxyacetic acid substrate due to stereochemical clashes in the active site and particularly for the R&#8208;isomer give high rebound barriers.

         <title>Sterically Crowded Tris(2&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)phenyl)phosphine &#8211; Is it Still a Ligand?</title>

P(o&#8208;TMSC6H4)3: A phosphine with selective reactivity. The steric bulk (represented by the security guard) shields the phosphorus from most external influences &#8211; but not from all. Spectroscopy and diffraction reveal the structural diversity of this molecule and its hand picked reaction products.







Abstract
Tris(2&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)phenyl)phosphine, P(o&#8208;TMSC6H4)3, was synthesised and characterised in solution and in the solid state. The large steric bulk prevents most reactions of the phosphorus donor and makes the compound air stable both in the solid state as well as in solution. This shielded phosphine can still undergo three reactions, namely protonation, oxidation to the phosphine oxide under harsh conditions and complexation to AuI, thus forming a complex with linear coordination. Unexpectedly, complexation was unsuccessful with a range of other metal cations. Neither PdII, PtII, ZnII nor HgII reacted and even the remaining coinage metal cations CuI and AgI could not be coordinated. Both the parent molecule as well as the reaction products were structurally characterised by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, and the conformational change of geometry required to accommodate the additional atoms was analysed in detail. Apart from chemical oxidation with H2O2, P(o&#8208;TMSC6H4)3 displays reversible electrochemical oxidation with a potential not unlike the one of sterically unencumbered phosphines for which the oxidation is usually not reversible. P(o&#8208;TMSC6H4)3 can thus be considered a model compound for the investigation of the electronic properties of sterically unencumbered phosphines.

         <title>Modulation of the Conformational Space of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA Quadruplex RG&#8208;1&#8201;by Cellular Components and the Amyloidogenic Peptides &#945;&#8208;Synuclein and hIAPP</title>

Pre&#8208;existing conditions play a critical role in disease progression after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. In this study, we sought to unravel the underlying mechanisms related to the interactions between peptides relevant to type II diabetes mellitus and Parkinson's disease and the G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;forming sequence RG&#8208;1 of the viral RNA.







Abstract
Given the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome&#8208;coronavirus&#8208;2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2), which particularly threatens older people with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus and dementia, understanding the relationship between Covid&#8208;19 and other diseases is an important factor for treatment. Possible targets for medical intervention include G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4Qs) and their protein interaction partners. We investigated the stability and conformational space of the RG&#8208;1 RNA&#8208;G&#8208;quadruplex of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 N&#8208;gene in the presence of salts, cosolutes, crowders and intrinsically disordered peptides, focusing on &#945;&#8208;Synuclein and the human islet amyloid polypeptide, which are involved in Parkinson's disease (PD) and type&#8208;II diabetes mellitus (T2DM), respectively. We found that the conformational dynamics of the RG&#8208;1 G4Q is strongly affected by the various solution conditions. Further, the amyloidogenic peptides were found to strongly modulate the conformational equilibrium of the RG&#8208;1. Considerable changes are observed with respect to their interaction with human telomeric G4Qs, which adopt different topologies. These results may therefore shed more light on the relationship between PD as well as T2DM and the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 disease and their molecular underpinnings. Since dysregulation of G4Q formation by rationally designed targeting compounds affects the control of cellular processes, this study should contribute to the development of specific ligands for intervention.

         <title>Ring Opening Reactions of &#946;&#8208;Propiolactam in Superacidic Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Opening up possibilities: The reaction of &#946;&#8208;propiolactam in the superacidic systems HF/MF5 and SO2/HF/MF5 (M=Sb, As) leads exclusively to previously unknown open&#8208;chain compounds. With HF as the solvent, salts of monoprotonated 3&#8208;aminopropanoyl fluoride and diprotonated &#946;&#8208;alanine are obtained, depending on the reaction conditions. Interestingly, the change of the solvent to SO2 leads to the formation of a salt containing a thionylimide moiety.







Abstract
The reaction of &#946;&#8208;propiolactam in the superacidic systems HF/MF5 (M=Sb, As) led to the formation of monoprotonated 3&#8208;aminopropanoyl fluoride in the form of [C(O)F(CH2)2NH3][SbF6] and [C(O)F(CH2)2NH3][AsF6]. In the presence of traces of water, the diprotonated species &#946;&#8208;alanine [C(OH)2(CH2)2NH3][AsF6]2 was synthesized for the first time. All salts were characterized by low&#8208;temperature infrared and Raman spectroscopy. Additionally, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analyses were conducted in the case of [C(O)F(CH2)2NH3][SbF6] and [C(OH)2(CH2)2NH3][AsF6]2. By using SO2 instead of HF as the solvent, the salt [C(OH)2(CH2)2NHSO][SbF6]2 was obtained, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of this salt containing a thionylimide moiety was conducted. For the formation of these open&#8208;chain compounds, an acyl cationic species as intermediate is assumed, which is formed from N&#8208;protonated &#946;&#8208;propiolactam. Quantum chemical calculations at the B3LYP/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ and MP2/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ levels of theory were carried out to gain a better understanding of the formation and the structural properties of protonated &#946;&#8208;propiolactam.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reaction of &#946;-propiolactam in the superacidic systems HF/&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;=Sb, As) led to the formation of monoprotonated 3-aminopropanoyl fluoride in the form of [C(O)F(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;][SbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] and [C(O)F(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;][AsF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]. In the presence of traces of water, the diprotonated species &#946;-alanine [C(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;][AsF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was synthesized for the first time. All salts were characterized by low-temperature infrared and Raman spectroscopy. Additionally, single-crystal X-ray analyses were conducted in the case of [C(O)F(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;][SbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] and [C(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;][AsF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. By using SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; instead of HF as the solvent, the salt [C(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NHSO][SbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was obtained, and single-crystal X-ray analysis of this salt containing a thionylimide moiety was conducted. For the formation of these open-chain compounds, an acyl cationic species as intermediate is assumed, which is formed from N-protonated &#946;-propiolactam. Quantum chemical calculations at the B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ and MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ levels of theory were carried out to gain a better understanding of the formation and the structural properties of protonated &#946;-propiolactam.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Coordination&#8208;Induced Band Gap Reduction in a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordination&#8208;induced band gap reduction. Experimental Tauc plots indicate that TUB1 possesses indirect and direct band gaps of 2.4&#8197;eV and 2.7&#8197;eV, respectively. DFT calculations reveal two spin&#8208;dependent gaps of 2.60&#8197;eV and 0.48&#8197;eV for the alpha and beta spins, respectively, with the lowest unoccupied crystal orbital for both gaps predominantly residing on the square planar copper atoms. This results in a lower overall band gap, as the beta&#8208;gap for the trigonal bipyramidal copper atoms is 3.72&#8197;eV.







Abstract
Herein, we report on the synthesis of a microporous, three&#8208;dimensional phosphonate metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with the composition Cu3(H5&#8208;MTPPA)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2 NMP (H8&#8208;MTPPA=methane tetra&#8208;p&#8208;phenylphosphonic acid and NMP=N&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidone). This MOF, termed TUB1, has a unique one&#8208;dimensional inorganic building unit composed of square planar and distorted trigonal bipyramidal copper atoms. It possesses a (calculated) BET surface area of 766.2&#8197;m2/g after removal of the solvents from the voids. The Tauc plot for TUB1 yields indirect and direct band gaps of 2.4&#8197;eV and 2.7&#8197;eV, respectively. DFT calculations reveal the existence of two spin&#8208;dependent gaps of 2.60&#8197;eV and 0.48&#8197;eV for the alpha and beta spins, respectively, with the lowest unoccupied crystal orbital for both gaps predominantly residing on the square planar copper atoms. The projected density of states suggests that the presence of the square planar copper atoms reduces the overall band gap of TUB1, as the beta&#8208;gap for the trigonal bipyramidal copper atoms is 3.72&#8197;eV.

         <title>Bimodal Fluorescence/Magnetic Resonance Molecular Probes with Extended Spin Lifetimes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;lived nuclear singlet states have been shown to be a viable tool in many different areas of research, from material sciences over the investigation of catalytic cycles to applications in biochemistry. The synthesis of four compounds, in which a nuclear singlet state in pairs of 13C and 15N nuclei can be populated is shown. Furthermore, bimodal fluorescence/singlet&#8208;state NMR application for the determination of water concentration has been investigated, which can be useful in a variety of fields.







Abstract
Bimodal molecular probes combining nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and fluorescence have been widely studied in basic science, as well as clinical research. The investigation of spin phenomena holds promise to broaden the scope of available probes allowing deeper insights into physiological processes. Herein, a class of molecules with a bimodal character with respect to fluorescence and nuclear spin singlet states is introduced. Singlet states are NMR silent but can be probed indirectly. Symmetric, perdeuterated molecules, in which the singlet states can be populated by vanishingly small electron&#8208;mediated couplings (below 1&#8197;Hz) are reported. The lifetimes of these states are an order of magnitude longer than the longitudinal relaxation times and up to four&#8197;minutes at 7 T. Moreover, these molecules show either aggregation induced emission (AIE) or aggregation caused quenching (ACQ) with respect to their fluorescence. In the latter case, the existence of excited dimers, which are proposed to use in a switchable manner in combination with the quenching of nuclear spin singlet states, is observed

         <title>Injectable Micromotor@Hydrogel System for Antibacterial Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An injectable micromotor@hydrogel drug delivery system which can be injected directly into lesions to release micromotors in response to the environment has been developed to reduce external influence on micromotors and improve the sustained&#8208;release effect. Micromotors underwent enhanced diffusion in the surroundings of bacteria without addition of exogenous hydrogen peroxide, which was manifested by their appearance in edge of the inhibition zone. The proposed micromotor@hydrogel drug delivery system offers a new strategy for the treatment of bacterial infections.







Abstract
The drug delivery system based on nano/micromotors has become a research hot spot in recent years. However, naked micromotors may be ruptured or passivated under the complex biological environment, which will result in the leakage of drugs in advance or limited self&#8208;propulsion performance. Herein, an injectable micromotor@hydrogel drug delivery system to protect micromotors from the external environment is proposed. The micromotors were prepared through layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly technology. The asymmetric decomposition of hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by the locally distributed platinum nanoparticles enabled efficient propulsion of the micromotors in low concentration of hydrogen peroxide. In order to protect micromotors, they were loaded into the Schiff base hydrogel. The micromotor@hydrogel system can be injected directly into the lesion to release micromotors in response to the environment, reducing external influence on micromotors and improving the sustained&#8208;release effect. Erythromycin (Ery) loaded into the micromotors and the micromotor@hydrogel system demonstrated excellent antibacterial effect. Micromotors released from the hydrogel underwent enhanced diffusion in the surroundings of bacteria without addition of exogenous hydrogen peroxide, which was manifested by their appearance in edge of the inhibition zone. The proposed micromotor@hydrogel drug delivery system offers a new strategy for the treatment of bacterial infections.

         <title>Rhodium&#8211;Iodide Complex on a Catalytically Active SiO2 Surface for One&#8208;Pot Hydrosilylation&#8211;CO2 Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface Rh species with three iodine atoms showed a high catalytic activity for the hydrosilylation of terminal olefins. The picture indicates three iodides with an ammonium cation &#8220;tent&#8221; coordinate to Rh, and the hydrosilylation reaction occurs at the electron&#8208;rich Rh site. Next, the intermediate reacts with CO2 coming from the factory with the assistance of an iodide, then the final product silyl carbonate is formed. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Motokura et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104001).

         <title>Olefin Metathesis in Confinement: Towards Covalent Organic Framework Scaffolds for Increased Macrocyclization Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic confinement and precise spatial arrangement of catalysts in porous media can provide increased selectivity for reactions compared to homogeneous catalysis. Herein, a covalent organic framework for molecular heterogeneous olefin metathesis is presented that utilizes spatial confinement of substrates in its pores for a substrate&#8208;size dependent and increased macro(mono)cyclization selectivity.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer vast structural and chemical diversity enabling a wide and growing range of applications. While COFs are well&#8208;established as heterogeneous catalysts, so far, their high and ordered porosity has scarcely been utilized to its full potential when it comes to spatially confined reactions in COF pores to alter the outcome of reactions. Here, we present a highly porous and crystalline, large&#8208;pore COF as catalytic support in &#945;,&#969;&#8208;diene ring&#8208;closing metathesis reactions, leading to increased macrocyclization selectivity. COF pore&#8208;wall modification by immobilization of a Grubbs&#8208;Hoveyda&#8208;type catalyst via a mild silylation reaction provides a molecularly precise heterogeneous olefin metathesis catalyst. An increased macro(mono)cyclization (MMC) selectivity over oligomerization (O) for the heterogeneous COF&#8208;catalyst (MMC:O=1.35) of up to 51&#8201;% compared to the homogeneous catalyst (MMC:O=0.90) was observed along with a substrate&#8208;size dependency in selectivity, pointing to diffusion limitations induced by the pore confinement.

         <title>Lights and Shadows of DMSO as Solvent for Tin Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dead&#8208;end for DMSO? The crystallization of tin halide perovskites into thin&#8208;films is uncontrolled. The strongly&#8208;binding solvent DMSO and its tolerance to additives helped here. However, device performance stagnates around 10&#8211;15&#8201;%. The oxidation of tin by DMSO could explain this. Efforts to substitute it are promising, but still lag behind. Addressing solution properties from a fundamental perspective will allow developing DMSO&#8208;free systems.







Abstract
In 2020 dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), the ever&#8208;present solvent for tin halide perovskites, was identified as an oxidant for SnII. Nonetheless, alternatives are lacking and few efforts have been devoted to replacing it. To understand this trend it is indispensable to learn the importance of DMSO on the development of tin halide perovskites. Its unique properties have allowed processing compact thin&#8208;films to be integrated into tin perovskite solar cells. Creative approaches for controlling the perovskite crystallization or increasing its stability to oxidation have been developed relying on DMSO&#8208;based inks. However, increasingly sophisticated strategies appear to lead the field to a plateau of power conversion efficiency in the range of 10&#8211;15&#8201;%. And, while DMSO&#8208;based formulations have performed in encouraging means so far, we should also start considering their potential limitations. In this concept article, we discuss the benefits and limitations of DMSO&#8208;based tin perovskite processing.

         <title>Ylide&#8208;Stabilized Phosphenium Cations: Impact of the Substitution Pattern on the Coordination Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switching selectivity: The isolation and coordination chemistry of a series of ylide&#8208;substituted phosphenium cations is reported. The monoylidyl cations exhibit a distinctly higher reactivity and electrophilicity, thus yielding a chlorophosphine gold cation via chloride shift from gold to phosphorus. In contrast, the diylidyl cation formed the phosphenium AuCl complex, demonstrating the tunability of the phosphenium cation reactivity.







Abstract
Although N&#8208;heterocyclic phosphenium (NHP) cations have received considerable research interest due to their application in organocatalysis, including asymmetric synthesis, phosphenium cations with other substitution patterns have hardly been explored. Herein, the preparation of a series of ylide&#8208;substituted cations of type [YPR]+ (with Y=Ph3PC(Ph), R=Ph, Cy or Y) and their structural and coordination properties are reported. Although the diylide&#8208;substituted cation forms spontaneous from the chlorophosphine precursor, the monoylidylphosphenium ions required the addition of a halide&#8208;abstraction reagent. The molecular structures of the cations reflected the different degrees of electron donation from the ylide to the phosphorus center depending on the second substituent. Molecular orbital analysis confirmed the stronger donor properties of the ylide systems compared to NHPs with the mono&#8208;ylide substituted cations featuring a more pronounced electrophilicity. This was mirrored by the reaction of the cations towards gold chloride, in which only the diylide&#8208;substituted cation [Y2P]+ formed the expected LAuCl]+ complex, while the monoylide&#8208;substituted compounds reacted to the chlorophosphine ligands by transfer of the chloride from gold to the phosphorus center. These results demonstrate the tunability of ylide&#8208;functionalized phosphorus cations, which should allow for further applications in coordination chemistry in the future.

         <title>Alkaline Stability of Low Oxophilicity Metallopolymer Anion&#8208;Exchange Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metallopolymers can address many of the challenges of anion&#8208;exchange membranes in electrochemical devices, especially those requiring high alkaline stability. Using the same polymer backbone and NHC ligand, membranes are prepared using low oxophilicity metals such as Cu, Zn, Ni and Au, and their relative alkaline stabilities are compared. The Au(III) metallopolymer demonstrates unparalleled alkaline stability and good ion&#8208;conductivity.







Abstract
Anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) are promising energy conversion devices due to their high efficiency. Nonetheless, AEMFC operation time is currently limited by the low chemical stability of their polymeric anion&#8208;exchange membranes. In recent years, metallopolymers, where the metal centers assume the ion transport function, have been proposed as a chemically stable alternative. Here we present a systematic study using a polymer backbone with side&#8208;chain N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands complexed to various metals with low oxophilicity, such as copper, zinc, nickel, and gold. The golden metallopolymer, using the metal with the lowest oxophilicity, demonstrates exceptional alkaline stability, far superior to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quaternary ammonium cations, as well as good in situ AEMFC results. These results demonstrate that judiciously designed metallopolymers may be superior to purely organic membranes and provides a scientific base for further developments in the field.

         <title>Properties of the reactants and their interactions within and with the enzyme binding
cavity determine reaction selectivities. The case of Fe(II)/2&#8208;oxoglutarate dependent enzymes.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fe(II)/2&#8208;oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenases (ODDs) share a double stranded beta helix (DSBH) fold and utilise a common reactive intermediate, ferryl species, to catalyse oxidative transformations of substrates. Despite the structural similarities, ODDs accept a variety of substrates and facilitate a wide range of reactions, i.e. hydroxylations, desaturations, (oxa)cyclisations and ring rearrangements. In this review we present and discuss the factors contributing to the observed (regio)selectivities of ODDs. They span from inherent properties of the reactants, i.e. substrate molecule and iron cofactor, to the interactions between the substrate and the enzyme&#8217;s binding cavity; the latter can counterbalance the effect of the former. Based on results of both experimental and computational studies dedicated to ODDs, we also line out the properties of the reactants which promote reaction outcomes other than the &#8220;default&#8221; hydroxylation. It turns out that the reaction selectivity depends on a delicate balance of interactions between the components of the investigated system.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of the Flexibility of Nickel PCP&#8208;Pincer Complexes on C&#8211;H and P&#8211;C Bond Activation and Ethylene Reactivity: A Combined Experimental and Theoretical Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using a pincer platform based on a bridgehead NHC donor with functional side arms, we examined the combined effect of increased flexibility in six&#8208;membered pyrimidine&#8208;type heterocycles compared to the more often studied five&#8208;membered imidazole, and rigidity of phosphane side arms. The unique features observed include (i) the reaction of the azolium Csp2&#8211;H bond with [Ni(cod)2] affording a carbanionic ligand in [NiCl(PCsp3HP)] (8) rather than a carbene, (ii) its transformation into the NHC, hydrido complex [NiH(PCNHCP)]PF6&#160;(9) upon halide abstraction, (iii) ethylene insertion into the Ni&#8211;H bond of the latter and ethyl migration to the N&#8211;C&#8211;N carbon atom of the heterocycle in [Ni(PCEtP)]PF6&#160;(10) and (iv) an unprecedented C&#8211;P bond activation transforming the P&#8211;CNHC&#8211;P pincer ligand of&#160;8&#160;in a C&#8211;CNHC&#8211;P pincer and a terminal phosphanido ligand in [Ni(PPh2)(CCNHCP)] (15). The data are supported by 9 crystal structure determinations and theoretical calculations provided insights into the mechanisms of these transformations, which are relevant to stoichiometric and catalytic steps of general interest.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Polyoxygenated Tropolones and their Antiviral Activity Against Hepatitis B Virus and Herpes Simplex Virus&#8208;1</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyoxygenated tropolones possess a broad range of biological activity, and as a result are promising lead structures or fragments for drug&#8208;development. However, structure&#8208;function studies and subsequent optimization have been challenging, in part due to the limited number of readily available tropolones and the obstacles to their synthesis.&#160; The oxidopyrylium [5+2] cycloaddition reaction can effectively generate a diverse array of 7&#8208;membered ring carbocycles, and as a result can provide a highly general strategy for tropolone synthesis.&#160; Here, we describe the use of 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;pyrone&#8208;based oxidopyrylium cycloaddition chemistry in synthesis of functionalized 3,7&#8208;dimethoxytropolones, 3,7&#8208;dihydroxytropolones, and isomeric 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;7&#8208;methoxytropolones through complementary benzyl alcohol&#8208;incorporating procedures. Antiviral activity of these molecules against herpes simplex virus&#8208;1 and hepatitis B virus is also described, highlighting the value of this approach and providing new structure&#8208;function insight relevant to their antiviral activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Arylative Cyclizations of Alkyne&#8208; and Allene&#8208;Tetethered Electrophiles using Arylboron Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of arylboron reagents in metal&#8208;catalyzed domino addition&#8722;cyclization reactions is a well&#8208;established strategy for the preparation of diverse, highly functionalized carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic products. Although rhodium&#8208; and palladium&#8208;based catalysts have been commonly used for these reactions, more recent work has demonstrated nickel catalysis is also highly effective, in many cases offering unique reactivity and access to products that might otherwise not be readily available. This review gives an overview of nickel&#8208;catalyzed arylative cyclizations of alkynyl and allenyl electrophiles using arylboron reagents. The scope of the reactions is discussed in detail, and general mechanistic concepts underpinning the processes are described.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 3&#8208;Methyleneisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones and Isoquinolinium Salts via Exo and Endo Selective Cyclization of 2&#8208;(1&#8208;Alkynyl)benzaldimines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coinage metal&#8208;promoted 5&#8208;  exo  and 6&#8208;  endo  selective cyclization of 2&#8208;(1&#8208;alkynyl)benzaldimines have been studied. It was found that, under gold catalysis, 2&#8208;(1&#8208;alkynyl)benzaldimines underwent exclusive 5&#8208;  exo  &#8208;dig cyclization processes, followed by oxidation to form  N  &#8208;aryl 3&#8208;methyleneisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones. In contrast, in the presence of base and under activation of AgOTf, switching of 5&#8208;  exo  into 6&#8208;  endo  cyclizations of 2&#8208;(1&#8208;alkynyl)benzaldimines was observed, exclusively giving  N  &#8208;aryl or  N  &#8208;alkyl substituted isoquinolinium salts. The two key reaction intermediates, exocyclic vinyl&#8208;Au and the endocyclic vinyl&#8208;Ag species have been isolated and characterized, and the study of their reactivities confirms the plausible mechanisms. Moreover, reacting the resultant 3&#8208;methyleneisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones with benzyne could afford structurally important isoindolinone&#8208;based benzocyclobutenes. Additionally, several interesting transformations of the resultant isoquinolinium salts have been also investigated.</dc:description>

         <title>Formation of supramolecular nanostructures via in situ self&#8208;assembly and post&#8208;assembly modification of a biocatalytically constructed dipeptide hydrazide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous self&#8208;assembly of short peptides has attracted growing attention for the construction of supramolecular materials for various bioapplications. Herein, we describe that the thermolysin&#8208;assisted biocatalytic construction of a dipeptide hydrazide from an  N  &#8208;protected amino acid and an amino acid hydrazide leads to the formation of thermally stable supramolecular hydrogels. In addition, we demonstrate the post&#8208;assembly modification of the  in situ  constructed supramolecular architectures tethering hydrazide groups as a chemical handle by means of fluorescence imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Abnormal Association between Metal&#8208;organic cages and counterions regulated by the Hydration Shells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We observed a unique trend in the binding affinity between cationic metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) and external counter&#8208;anions in aqueous media. Behaving like many macroions, two MOCs, sharing similar structures but carrying different number of charges, self&#8208;assembled into hollow spherical single&#8208;layered blackberry&#8208;type structures via counterion&#8208;mediated attraction. Dynamic and static light scattering, and isothermal titration calorimetry measurements confirm the stronger interactions among less charged MOCs and counter&#8208;anions than that of highly charged MOCs, leading to larger assembly sizes. DOSY NMR measurements suggest the significance of thick hydration shells of highly charged MOCs, inhibiting the MOC&#8208;counterion binding and weakening the interaction between them. This study demonstrates that the greater role played by hydration shell on ion&#8208;pair formation comparing with charge density of MOCs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Separation of xylene isomers is one of the most important but most challenging and energy&#8208;intensive separation processes in the petrochemical industry. Here, we report an adaptive hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF&#8208;28) constructed from a porphyrin based organic building block 4,4',4'',4'''&#8208;(porphyrin&#8208;5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrayl) tetrabenzonitrile (PTTBN), exhibiting the exclusive molecular recognition of p&#8208;xylene (pX) over its isomers of o&#8208;xylene (oX) and m&#8208;xylene (mX), as clearly demonstrated in the single crystal structure transformation and 1H NMR studies. Single crystal structure studies show that single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation from the as&#8208;synthesized HOF&#8208;28 to the pX exclusively included HOF&#8208;28&#201;pX is triggered by the encapsulation of pX molecules, accompanied by sliding of the 2D layers and local distortion of the ligand, which provides multiple C&#8722;H&#183;&#183; &#960; interactions.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The present review focuses on recent examples of tetracoordinate boryl groups greatly influencing reactions in organic synthesis. Electron&#8208;rich tetracoordinate boryl groups stabilize or activate reactive intermediates such as cations, radicals and &#960;&#8208;conjugation systems, and interaction of the intermediates with carbon&#8211;boron or heteroatom&#8211;boron bonds is the origin of such substituent effects. Unique substituent effects of tetracoordinate boryl groups often promote desired reactions and affect results of reactions such as yield and selectivity of products.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable excimer circularly polarized luminescence in isohexide derivatives from renewable resources</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic compounds showing circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) are at the forefront of novel applications and technologies. Here we show the synthesis and chiroptical properties of pyrene and perylene derivatives of inexpensive chiral scaffolds: isomannide and isosorbide. Low&#8208;intensity ECD spectra were obtained, suggesting the absence of chromophore interaction in the ground state, except in the case of isomannide bis&#8208;perylenecarboxylate, whose ECD spectrum showed a positive exciton couplet. All isomannide derivatives, with the only exception of the one containing a pyrenecarboxylate and a perylenecarboxylate, exhibited excimer CPL spectra, whereas isosorbide derivatives did not show any CPL. Isomannide derivatives bearing two pyrenecarboxylate or two pyrenylacetate groups showed positive CPL emission with dissymmetry factors up to 10  &#8208;2  , which depends on the conformational freedom of the appended units. The CPL sign, Stokes shift and order of magnitude of dissymmetry factor were reproduced by excited&#8208;state calculations on a representative compound. Interestingly, the mixed derivative containing pyrenic units with different spacing from the isomannide scaffold showed an oppositely signed excimer band with respect to the homo&#8208;substituted derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>1,2,3&#8208;Tri(9&#8208;anthryl)benzene: Photophysical Properties and Solid&#8208;State Intermolecular Interactions of Radially Arranged, Congested Aromatic &#960;&#8208;Planes**

Anthracene congestion: 1,2,3&#8208;Tri(9&#8208;anthryl)benzene derivatives containing radially shaped &#960;&#8208;clusters were constructed by using PdI&#8208;catalyzed Negishi coupling reactions. The presence of &#960;&#8208;congestion as well as intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; and CH&#8211;&#960; interactions between anthracene units in the crystalline state gives these substances unique electronic properties. The excited&#8208;state dynamics associated with the radially arranged &#960;&#8208;system were elucidated by using transient absorption measurements.







Abstract
We report the Negishi coupling based synthesis of 1,2,3&#8208;tri(9&#8208;anthryl)benzene derivatives containing three radially arranged anthracenes in a &#960;&#8208;cluster. In the crystalline state of the unsubstituted derivative, intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; and CH&#8211;&#960; interactions between the anthracene units drive the formation of the two&#8208;dimensional packing structure. Owing to though&#8208;space &#960;&#8208;conjugation between anthracene units, the substances have unique electronic properties. The excited&#8208;state dynamic behavior occurring between the three anthracene moieties, such as exciton localization/delocalization, was elucidated by means of transient absorption measurements and quantum chemical calculations. Interestingly, even though the three anthracenes are closely oriented with approximately 3.0&#8197;&#197; between their C&#8208;9 positions, exciton localization on two anthracene units is energetically favorable because of the flexible nature of the radially arranged aromatic rings.

         <title>Chiral Dinuclear EuIII, TbIII, and YIII Complexes Supported by P&#8208;Stereogenic Linear Tetraphosphine Tetraoxide</title>

A new P&#8208;stereogenic linear tetraphosphine tetraoxide, (R,R)/(S,S)&#8208;Ph2P(=O)CH2P(=O)(Ph)CH2P(=O)(Ph)CH2P(=O)Ph2 abbreviated as (R,R)/(S,S)&#8208;dpmppm(=O)4 (L4RR/SS), was synthesized to prepare C2 dinuclear M(hfa)3 complexes, [M2((R,R)/(S,S)&#8208;dpmppm(=O)4)(hfa)6] (M=Y, Eu, Tb: M2L4RR/SS), which revealed significant chiral induction from the P&#8208;chiral centers on the achiral M(hfa)3 units through intramolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking constraint in the dinuclear system on the basis of circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) measurements.







Abstract
A P&#8208;stereogenic linear tetraphosphine tetraoxide, (R,R)&#8208; or (S,S)&#8208;dpmppm(=O)4, was synthesized to prepare C2 dinuclear M(hfa)3 complexes (M=Eu, Tb, Y) as the first example of lanthanide(III) complexes with P&#8208;chiral multidentate phosphine oxides. The mononuclear M(hfa)3 complexes (M=Eu, Y) with a P&#8208;chiral diphosphine dioxide, tpdpb(=O)2, were also prepared, and comparison of their photophysical properties for the EuIII complexes revealed that significant chiral induction from the P&#8208;chiral centers arises on the achiral M(hfa)3 units through intramolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking constraint in the dinuclear system.

The chiral &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylalanine is shown to induce and control the screw&#8208;sense preference of short Aib oligomers. Due to the electronic properties of the CF3 group, the screw&#8208;sense is inversed compared to that induced by its non&#8208;fluorinated isosteric l&#8208;&#945;&#8208;MeVal analogue. It also plays the role of 19F NMR reporter allowing the easy determination of both the magnitude of the screw&#8208;sense preference and the assignment of its sign.







Abstract
Oligomers of &#945;&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) are achiral peptides that adopt 310 helical structures with equal population of left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed conformers. The screw&#8208;sense preference of the helical chain may be controlled by a single chiral residue located at one terminus. 1H and 19F NMR, X&#8208;ray crystallography and circular dichroism studies on new Aib oligomers show that the incorporation of a chiral quaternary &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylalanine at their N&#8208;terminus induces a reversal of the screw&#8208;sense preference of the 310&#8208;helix compared to that of a non&#8208;fluorinated analogue having an l&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methyl valine residue. This work demonstrates that, among the many particular properties of introducing a trifluoromethyl group into foldamers, its stereo&#8208;electronic properties are of major interest to control the helical screw sense. Its use as an easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle 19F NMR probe to reliably determine both the magnitude of the screw&#8208;sense preference and its sign assignment is also of remarkable interest.

         <title>d&#8208;Orbital Reconstructions Forced by Double Bow&#8208;Shaped Deformations and Second Coordination Sphere Effects of Cu(II) Heme Analogs in HER**

The electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance of copper heme analogs has been modulated by geometric deformation. The work not only provides a new perspective on the function of natural heme distortion but also contributes a practical strategy to improve the catalytic performance of hemes through ligand geometric modulation.







Abstract
Both geometric architecture and electronic configurations of heme proteins contribute to its activity. In this work we designed and synthesized a series of four copper(II) porphyrin complexes (4&#8208;, 3&#8208;, 2&#8208; and 1&#8208;Cu) where the molecular conformations are modulated by a pair of stepwise shortened straps on the same porphyrin side (cis&#8208;ortho) to give double bow&#8208;shaped skeletons. Single crystal structures demonstrate that the straps gradually increase the saddle deformation and the deviation of the metal centers, which is in accordance with two, unusual d&#8208;orbital reconstructions of two different ground states, as revealed by 4&#8197;K EPR and DFT calculations. In the study of the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), 1&#8208;Cu, with the shortest straps, showed the most apparent improvement of activity. Second coordination sphere (SCS) effects created by the double bow&#8208;shaped architecture and the strong saddle porphyrin core in 1&#8208;Cu are found to play key roles in proton trapping during the catalytic process. The work contributes a novel strategy to improve the catalytic performance of heme analogs through ligand geometric modulation.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Bonding&#8208;Enhanced Self&#8208;Co&#8208;Reactant Electrogenerated Chemiluminescence for Sensitive and Selective Detection of Thioglycolic Acid in Cosmetics</title>

Au&#8722;S bonding&#8208;amplified, highly sensitive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) sensing method for Thioglycolic acid (TGA) detection using tris(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) (Ru(bpy)32+) as a luminophore and TGA as a self&#8208;co&#8208;reactant, via an anodic reaction at the Au electrode surface was reported.







Abstract
Thioglycolic acid (TGA) is an organic compound widely used in cosmetics that cause a variety of health problems when overexposed to it. So far many attempts have been made to develop methods for TGA detection, but most of them need sophisticated instrumentations and are a little bit complicated. Therefore, a simple, cheap and sensitive detection method of TGA is highly desired. Herein, we demonstrated for the first time an Au&#8722;S bonding amplified, highly sensitive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) sensing method for TGA detection using tris(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) (Ru(bpy)32+) as a luminophore and TGA as a self&#8208;co&#8208;reactant, via an anodic reaction at the Au electrode surface. Due to different molecular coordination environments of the TGA at the electrode surface, the ECL signal intensity of the developed ECL system gives much higher ECL signal in borate buffer than phosphate buffer of the same pH. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the ECL intensity has a direct relationship with the concentration of TGA in the range of 0.03&#8197;&#956;M to 300&#8197;&#956;M and a limit of detection of 0.013&#8197;&#956;M (3&#963;/m). The reported ECL system has further been applied for the detection of TGA in cosmetics with acceptable recoveries.

         <title>Linked Rotaxane Structure Restricts Local Molecular Motions in Solution to Enhance Fluorescence Properties of Tetraphenylethylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method to enhance the performance of fluorophores, with regards to properties such as fluorescence quantum yield and photostability, is reported in this work, using the fluorescent dye tetraphenylethylene. A linked rotaxane structure effectively prevents the local molecular motions of the fluorophore, leading to the enhancement of the performance.







Abstract
The restriction of local molecular motions is critical for improving the fluorescence quantum yields (FQYs) and the photostability of fluorescent dyes. Herein, we report a supramolecular approach to enhance the performance of fluorescent dyes by incorporating a linked rotaxane structure with permethylated &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrins. Tetraphenylethylene (TPE) derivatives generally exhibit low FQYs in solution due to the molecular motions in the excited state. We show that TPE with linked rotaxane structures on two sides displays up to 15&#8208;fold higher FQYs. Detailed investigations with variable temperature 1H NMR, UV&#8208;Vis, and photoluminescence spectroscopy revealed that the linked rotaxane structure rigidifies the TPE moiety and thus suppresses the local molecular motions and non&#8208;radiative decay. Moreover, the linked rotaxane structure enhances the FQY of the dye in various solvents, including aqueous solutions, and improves the photostability through the inhibition of local molecular motions in the excited TPE.

         <title>Regioselective Fluorination of Acenes: Tailoring of Molecular Electronic Levels and Solid&#8208;State Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling energy levels: Partial fluorination of tetracenes allows the precise adjustment of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels. By applying regioselective synthetic strategies, such functionalized tetracenes can be obtained, as demonstrated for the unilaterally fluorinated F3TET, F4TET and F5TET. The solid&#8208;state packing and optoelectronic properties of these materials are compared to the properties of their parental acenes.







Abstract
Optoelectronic properties of molecular solids are important for organic electronic devices and are largely determined by the adopted molecular packing motifs. In this study, we analyzed such structure&#8208;property relationships for the partially regioselective fluorinated tetracenes 1,2,12&#8208;trifluorotetracene, 1,2,10,12&#8208;tetrafluorotetracene and 1,2,9,10,11&#8208;pentafluorotetracene that were further compared with tetracene and perfluoro&#8208;tetracene. Quantum chemical DFT calculations in combination with optical absorption spectroscopy data show that the frontier orbital energies are lowered with the degree of fluorination, while their optical gap is barely affected. However, the crystal structure changes from a herringbone packing motif of tetracene towards a planar stacking motif of the fluorinated tetracene derivatives, which is accompanied by the formation of excimers and leads to strongly red&#8208;shifted photoluminescence with larger lifetimes.

         <title>Weak antiferromagnetic exchange and&#160;ferromagnetic alignment of FeII (S = 2) spins in differently charged {HAT&#215;(FeIICl2)3}n (n = 2&#8208; and 3&#8208;) assemblies of&#160;hexaazatriphenylenes (HAT)</title>

         <dc:description>Hexaazatrianthracene (HATA) and hexaazatriphenylenehexacarbonitrile {HAT(CN)  6  } are reduced by metallic iron in the presence of crystal violet CVCl. Anionic ligands are produced, which simultaneously coordinate three Fe  II  Cl  2  to form (CV+)2{HATA&#215;(FeIICl2)3}2&#8208;&#215;3C6H4Cl2  (1) and (CV+)3{HAT(CN)6&#215;(FeIICl2)3}3&#8208;&#215;0.5CVCl&#215;2.5C6H4Cl2  (2). High&#8208;spin (  S  =2) FeII  atoms in both structures are arranged in equilateral triangles at a distance of 7&#160;&#197;. An antiferromagnetic exchange is observed between FeII  in {HATA&#215;(FeIICl2)3}2&#8208;  (1) with a Weiss temperature (  Q  ) of &#8208;80&#160;K, the PHI estimated exchange interaction (  J  ) is &#8208;4.7&#160;cm&#8208;1  . The {HAT(CN)6&#215;(FeIICl2)3}3&#8208;  assembly is obtained in  2  . The formation of HAT(CN)  6  &#183;3  &#8208;  is supported by the appearance of an intense EPR signal with  g  = 2.0037. The magnetic behavior of  2  is described by a strong antiferromagnetic coupling between the Fe  II  and HAT(CN)  6  &#183;3  &#8208;  spins with  J  1  = &#8208;164&#160;cm  &#8208;1  (&#8208;2  J  formalism) and by a weaker antiferromagnetic coupling between the Fe  II  spins with  J  2  = &#8208;15.4&#160;cm  &#8208;1  . The stronger coupling results in the spins of the three Fe  II  Cl  2  units to be aligned parallel to each other in the assembly. As a result, an increase of the  c  M  T  values is observed with the decrease of temperature from 9.82 at 300&#160;K up to 15.06&#160;emu&#215;K/mol at 6&#160;K, and  Q  = +23&#160;K. DFT calculations showed that, due to the high symmetry and nearly degenerated LUMO of both HATA and HAT(CN)  6  , their complexes with Fe  II  Cl  2  have a variety of closely lying excited high&#8208;spin states.</dc:description>

         <title>Lanthanide luminescent nanocomposite for non&#8208;invasive temperature monitoring in vivo</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The temperature monitoring  in vivo  plays a vital role in the investigation of biological processes of organisms and the improvement of disease theranostic methods. The development of lanthanide luminescent nanocomposite&#8208;derived temperature probes  in vivo  allows accurate and reliable interrogation of biological thermodynamic processes due to their superior photostability, high sensitivity, and non&#8208;invasive sensing fashion. This concept presented an overview of the recent development of lanthanide luminescent nanocomposite which are suitable for  in vivo  temperature monitoring, including the thermometric principles, key features, materials designs as well as their potential biomedical applications for non&#8208;invasive temperature detection in the living body. The perspectives of these lanthanide luminescent nanocomposite thermometers for the optimization of temperature monitoring performance and potential future development are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Continuous Flow Bioconjugations of NIR&#8208;AZA Fluorophores via Strained Alkyne Cycloadditions with Intra&#8208;chip Fluorogenic Monitoring</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The importance of bioconjugation reactions continues to grow for cell specific targeting and dual therapeutic plus diagnostic medical applications.&#160; This necessitates the development of new bioconjugation chemistries, in&#8208;flow synthetic and analytical methods.&#160; With this goal, continuous flow bioconjugations were readily achieved with short residence times for strained alkyne substituted carbohydrate and therapeutic peptide biomolecules in reaction with azide and tetrazine substituted fluorophores.&#160; The strained alkyne substrates included substituted 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;D&#8208;glucopyranose, and the linear and cyclic peptide sequences QIRQQPRDPPTETLELEVSPDPAS&#8208;OH and c(RGDfK) respectively.&#160; The catalyst and reagent&#8208;free inverse electron demand tetrazine cycloadditions proved more favourable than the azide 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions. Reaction completion was achieved with residence times of 5 min at 40 &#176;C for tetrazine versus 10 min at 80 &#176;C for azide cycloadditions.&#160; The use of a fluorogenic tetrazine fluorophore, in a glass channelled reactor chip, allowed for intra&#8208;chip reaction monitoring by recording fluorescence intensities at various positions throughout the chip. As the Diels&#8208;Alder reactions proceeded through the chip, the fluorescence intensity increased accordingly in real&#8208;time.&#160; The application of continuous flow fluorogenic bioconjugations could offer an efficient translational access to theranostic agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Revisiting the Fundamental Nature of&#160;Metal&#8208;Ligand Bonding: An Impartial and&#160;Automated&#160;Fitting Procedure for Angular&#160;Overlap Model Parameters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The properties and reactivities of transition metal complexes are often discussed&#160;in terms of Ligand Field Theory (LFT), and with  ab initio  LFT a direct connection&#160;to quantum chemical wavefunctions was recently established. The Angular&#160;Overlap Model (AOM) is a widely used, ligand&#8208;specific parameterization scheme&#160;of the ligand field splitting which has however been restricted by the availability&#160;and resolution of experimental data. Using  ab initio  LFT, we present here a generalised,&#160;symmetry&#8208;independent and automated fitting procedure for AOM parameters&#160;that is even applicable to formally underdetermined or experimentally&#160;inaccessible systems. This method allows quantitative evaluations of assumptions&#160;commonly made in AOM applications, e.g. transferability or relative magnitudes&#160;of AOM parameters, and the response of the ligand field to structural&#160;or electronic changes. A two&#8208;dimensional spectrochemical series of tetrahedral&#160;halido metalates ([M  II  X  4  ]  2&#8208;  , M=Mn&#8211;Cu) served as a case study. A previously&#160;unknown linear relationship between the halide ligands&#8217; chemical hardness and&#160;their AOM parameters was found. The impartial and automated procedure for&#160;identifying AOM parameters introduced here can be used to systematically improve&#160;our understanding of ligand&#8208;metal interactions in coordination complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural insights into pixatimod (PG545) inhibition of heparanase, a key enzyme in cancer and viral infections</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pixatimod (PG545), a heparan sulfate (HS) mimetic and anticancer agent currently in clinical trials, is a potent inhibitor of heparanase. Heparanase is an endo &#8208;&#946;&#8208;glucuronidase that degrades HS in the extracellular matrix and basement membranes and is implicated in numerous pathological processes such as cancer and viral infections, including SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. To understand how PG545 interacts with heparanase, we firstly carried out a conformational analysis through a combination of NMR experiments and molecular modelling which showed that the reducing end &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;glucose residue of PG545 adopts a distorted conformation. This was followed by docking and molecular dynamics simulations to study the interactions of PG545 with heparanase, revealing that PG545 is able to block the active site by binding in different conformations, with the cholestanol side&#8208;chain making important hydrophobic interactions. While PG545 blocks its natural substrate HS from binding to the active site, small synthetic heparanase substrates are only partially excluded, and thus pentasaccharide or larger substrates are preferred for assaying this class of inhibitor. This study provides new insights for the design of next&#8208;generation heparanase inhibitors and substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bridged Oligosilanylsilyl Mono&#8208; and Oligosilanylsilyl Dications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The presence of multiple Si&#8722;H functionalities in one molecule is used to generate at low temperatures oligosilane&#8208;based mono&#8208; and dications that are stabilized by intramolecular 3c2e Si&#8722;H&#8722;Si bridges. For the oligosilanylsilyl monocation, a rapid intramolecular Si&#8722;H group exchange is monitored by NMR spectroscopy at low temperatures. This dynamic process is not observed for the corresponding dication. According to the obtained NMR data, both cationic Si&#8722;H&#8722;Si bridges are electronically isolated by the trisilanyl backbone.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bridged oligosilanylsilyl borates 8&#8201;[B(C6F5)4], 9[B(C6F5)4] and diborates 10&#8201;[B(C6F5)4]2 have been prepared by hydride transfer between &#945;&#8208;&#969;&#8208;dihydrido&#8208; (11) and branched tetrahydrido&#8208;oligosilanes (13) and trityl cation. The obtained cyclic intramolecularly stabilized silylium ions 8, 9 and bissilylium ion 10 were characterized by low temperature NMR spectroscopy supported by the results of density functional calculations. The branched Si&#8722;H&#8722;Si monocation 9 undergoes at low temperatures a fast degenerate rearrangement, which exchanges the Si&#8722;H groups with a barrier of 31&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 via an antarafacial transition state. Reaction of the branched monocation 9 with a second equivalent of trityl cation or of the branched oligosilane 13 with two equivalents of trityl cation, gives at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C the corresponding bissilylium ion 10, an example for a new class of highly reactive poly&#8208;Lewis acids.

         <title>Calixarenes Incorporating Sulfonamide Moieties: Versatile Ligands for Carbonic Anhydrases Inhibition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calixarene derivatives bearing arms terminating with primary benzensulfonamides demonstrated their ability of inhibiting human Carbonic Anhydrases with significant efficiency and selectivity among different isoforms of the enzymes. A mode of binding where the benzensulfonamide arm penetrates into the funnel of the enzyme active site and interacts with the protein Zn2+ ion is supported by X&#8208;ray diffraction data and MD calculations.







Abstract
Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) continue to represent a relevant pharmaceutical target. The need of selective inhibitors and the involvement of these metalloenzymes in many multifaceted diseases boost the search for new ligands able to distinguish among the different CA isoforms, and for multifunctional systems simultaneously able to inhibit CAs and to interfere with other pathological events by interacting with additional targets. In this work, we successfully explored the possibility of preparing new CAs ligands by combining calixarenes with benzensulfonamide units. Inhibition tests towards three human CA isoforms evidenced, for some of the ligands, Ki values in the nanomolar range and promising selectivity. X&#8208;ray and molecular modeling studies provided information on the mode of binding of these calixarene derivatives. Thanks to the encouraging results and the structural features typical of the calixarene scaffold, it is then possible to plan for the future the design of multifunctional inhibitors for this class of widely spread enzymes.

         <title>BOPHY&#8208;Fullerene C60 Dyad as a Photosensitizer for Antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photosensitizer: The first BOPHY&#8211;fullerene C60 dyad (BP&#8208;C60) has been synthesized and obtained as two atropisomers. The presence of the BOPHY light&#8208;harvesting antenna in the dyad increases the absorption of the fullerene moiety in the visible region and improves its photodynamic action. Photoinduced energy/electron transfer processes (EnT/PeT) take place from BOPHY to fullerene C60. The dyad exhibits an efficient production of reactive oxygen species. BP&#8208;C60 is a promising heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free photosensitizer with potential application in photodynamic treatments..







Abstract
A novel BOPHY&#8211;fullerene C60 dyad (BP&#8208;C60) was designed as a heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free photosensitizer (PS) with potential uses in photodynamic treatment and reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated applications. BP&#8208;C60 consists of a BOPHY fluorophore covalently attached to a C60 moiety through a pyrrolidine ring. The BOPHY core works as a visible&#8208;light&#8208;harvesting antenna, while the fullerene C60 subunit elicits the photodynamic action. This fluorophore&#8211;fullerene cycloadduct, obtained by a straightforward synthetic route, was fully characterized and compared with its individual counterparts. The restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the BOPHY and pyrrolidine moieties led to the formation of two atropisomers. Spectroscopic, electrochemical, and computational studies disclose an efficient photoinduced energy/electron transfer process from BOPHY to fullerene C60. Photodynamic studies indicate that BP&#8208;C60 produces ROS by both photomechanisms (type&#8197;I and type&#8197;II). Moreover, the dyad exhibits higher ROS production efficiency than its individual constitutional components. Preliminary screening of photodynamic inactivation on bacteria models (Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli) demonstrated the ability of this dyad to be used as a heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free PS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that not only a BOPHY&#8211;fullerene C60 dyad is reported, but also that a BOPHY derivative is applied to photoinactivate microorganisms. This study lays the foundations for the development of new BOPHY&#8208;based PSs with plausible applications in the medical field.

This study lays the foundations for the development of new BOPHY-based PSs with plausible applications in the medical field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have developed the first enantioselective reductive aldol reaction of unprotected &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids by employing a copper/bisphosphine catalyst. The reaction features in situ protection and activation of an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acid by a hydrosilane. The copper enolate formed in situ reacts with a ketone to afford the &#946;&#8208;hydroxy carboxylic acid with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99% ee). The corresponding gram&#8208;scale reaction with a low catalyst loading and the derivatization of the &#946;&#8208;hydroxy carboxylic acids highlight the practicality of this transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling of Aldehydes with Allylboronates Enables Facile Access to Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present herein a novel strategy for the preparation of ketones from aldehydes and allylic boronicesters. This reaction involves the allylation of aldehydes with allylic boronicesters and the Rh&#8208;catalyzed chain&#8208;walking of homoallylic alcohols. The key to this successful development is the protodeboronation of alkenyl borylether intermediate via a tetravalent borate anion species in the presence of KHF  2  and MeOH. This approach features mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, and excellent functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies also supported that the tandem allylation and chain&#8208;walking process was involved.</dc:description>

         <title>Bonding Character, Electron Delocalization, and Aromaticity of Cyclo[18]Carbon (C18) Precursors, C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2): Focusing on the Effect of Carbonyl (&#8208;CO) Groups**
</title>

         <dc:description>
The bonding character, electron delocalization, and aromaticity of C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2) were studied by advanced theoretical means. The difference of electron delocalization between two sets of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems and significant influence of the number of &#8208;CO groups on them were focused on, and the essential reason for the distinct difference in molecular aromaticity was elucidated.







Abstract
The bonding character, electron delocalization, and aromaticity of the cyclo[18]carbon (C18) precursors, C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2), have been studied by combining quantum chemical calculations and various electronic wavefunction analyses with different physical bases. It was found that C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2) molecules exhibit alternating long and short C&#8722;C bonds, and have out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane dual &#960; systems (&#960;out and &#960;in) perpendicular to each other, which are consistent with the relevant characteristics of C18. However, the presence of carbonyl (&#8208;CO) groups significantly reduced the global electron conjugation of C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2) compared to C18. Specifically, the &#8208;CO group largely breaks the extensive delocalization of &#960;in system, and the &#960;out system is also affected by it but to a much lesser extent; as a consequence, C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2) with larger n shows weaker overall aromaticity. Mostly because of the decreased but still apparent &#960;out electron delocalization in the C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2), a notable diatropic induced ring current under the action of external magnetic field is observed, demonstrating the clear aromatic characteristic in the molecules. The correlation between C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2) and C18 in terms of the gradual elimination of &#8208;CO from the precursors showed that the direct elimination of two CO molecules in C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2) has a synergistic mechanism, but it is kinetically infeasible under normal conditions due to the high energy barrier.

         <title>Borane Adducts of Aromatic Phosphorus Heterocycles: Synthesis, Crystallographic Characterization and Reactivity of a Phosphinine&#8208;B(C6F5)3 Lewis Pair</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and crystallographic characterization of a phosphinine&#8208;borane adduct was achieved for the first time by using a Me3Si&#8208;functionalized phosphinine and the Lewis acid B(C6F5)3. This reaction strongly depends on the nature of the substituents in the &#945;&#8208;position of the phosphorus heterocycle. In contrast, the reaction of B2H6 with various substituted phosphinines leads to an equilibrium between the starting materials and the phosphinine&#8208;borane adducts, which is determined by the Lewis&#8208;basicity of the phosphinine. The novel phosphinine borane adduct (6&#8208;B(C6F5)3) shows rapid and facile insertion and [4+2] cycloaddition reactivity towards phenylacetylene. With styrene a hitherto unknown dihydro&#8208;1&#8208;phosphabarrelene is formed. The reaction with an ester provides a new, facile and selective route to 1&#8208;R&#8208;phosphininium salts. These salts then undergo a [4+2] cycloaddition in the presence of Me3Si&#8208;C&#8801;CH and styrene, respectively, to cleanly form unprecedented derivatives of 1&#8208;R&#8208;phosphabarrelenium salts.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The targeted search for suitable solid&#8208;state ionic conductors requires a certain understanding of the conduction mechanism and the correlation of the structures and the resulting properties of the material.

The correlation between the ionic conductivity and the occupation of octahedral and tetrahedral sites in a close&#8208;packed array of P atoms in the series of compounds is discussed.

We conclude from this series that in order to receive fast ion conductors a partial occupation of the octahedral vacancies seems to be crucial.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
