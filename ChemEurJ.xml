         <title>Scaffold Editing of Cubanes into Homocubanes; Homocuneanes via Cuneanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective synthesis of cage&#8208;type hydrocarbons through the editing of the highly symmetric molecule cubane can be anticipated as one of the efficient approaches. In this paper, we identify a catalyst that facilitates the efficient scaffold isomerization of cubanes into homocubanes. This approach, which involves the direct synthesis of homocubanol esters, is promising as a novel method for the synthesis of phenoxy bioisosteres. Additionally, we observed that the isomerization of 1,4&#8208;diacyloxymethylcubane results in the generation of both D2&#8208; and C2&#8208;symmetrical bishomocubanes. The same catalyst was also applied to the isomerization of acyloxymethylcuneanes, producing homocuneanol esters.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Alkyl&#8208;Locked Axial Chirality Scaffold by Restriction of Molecular Motions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boosting the circularly polarized luminescence of small organic molecules has been a stubborn challenge because of weak structure rigidity and dynamic molecular motions. To investigate and eliminate these factors, here, we carried out the structure&#8208;property relationship studies on a newly&#8208;developed axial chiral scaffold of bidibenzo[b,d]furan. The molecular rigidity was finely tuned by gradually reducing the alkyl&#8208;chain length. The environmental factors were considered in solution, crystal, and polymer matrix at different temperatures. As a result, a significant amplification of the dissymmetry factor glum from 10&#8208;4 to 10&#8208;1 was achieved, corresponding to the situation from (R)&#8208;4C in solution to (R)&#8208;1C in polymer film at room temperature. A synergistic strategy of increasing the intramolecular rigidity and enhancing the intermolecular interaction to restrict the molecular motions was thus proposed to improve circularly polarized luminescence. The though&#8208;out demonstrated relationship will be of great importance for the development of high&#8208;performance small organic chiroptical systems in the future.</dc:description>

As a result, a significant amplification of the dissymmetry factor glum from 10-4 to 10-1 was achieved, corresponding to the situation from (R)-4C in solution to (R)-1C in polymer film at room temperature. A synergistic strategy of increasing the intramolecular rigidity and enhancing the intermolecular interaction to restrict the molecular motions was thus proposed to improve circularly polarized luminescence. The though-out demonstrated relationship will be of great importance for the development of high-performance small organic chiroptical systems in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Responsive Polyoxometalate@Metal&#8722;Organic Frameworks Involving Ir Metalloligands for Highly Selective Photocatalytic Oxidation of Sulfides to Sulfoxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of highly efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive photocatalysts is fundamental to solving the problems of low efficiency and poor selectivity in photocatalytic organic synthesis reactions. We synthesized a crystalline polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;based metal&#8722;organic framework material {Zn4(H2O)8[Ir(ppy)2(dcbpy)]4[SiW12O40]}&#183;4H2O (Ir&#8208;SiW) by self&#8208;assembly of Ir metalloligands with POMs. The introduction of Ir metalloligands extends the light absorbing range to visible light, improving the efficient utilization of solar energy. The transfer of photogenerated electrons from Ir metalloligands to SiW12 was observed under visible light irradiation, which boosted the carrier separation efficiency. The synergistic effect of the two components increased the photocatalytic thioether oxidation activity, and the product methyl phenyl sulfoxide for 2.5h under visible light irradiation (&#955; &gt; 400 nm) reached 99.5%, which was higher than those of other POM&#8208;based photocatalysts. Meanwhile, the yield of methyl phenyl sulfoxide was still higher than 97% after three cycles, demonstrating the high stability and reusability of Ir&#8208;SiW.</dc:description>

         <title>A pseudo&#8208;Double&#8208;Network Hydrogel Built upon Layered Double Hydroxides with Self&#8208;Strengthening Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While great achievements have been made in the development of mechanically robust nanocomposite hydrogels, incorporating multiple interactions on the bases of two demensional inorganic cross&#8208;linkers to construct self&#8208;strengthening hydrogels has rarely been investigated. To this end, we propose here a new method for the coupling the dynamic covalent bonds and non&#8208;covalent interactions within a pseudo double&#8208;network system. The pseudo first network, formed through the Schiff Base reation between Tris&#8208;modified layered double hydroxides (Tris&#8208;LDHs) and oxidized dextran (ODex), is linked to the second network built upon non&#8208;covalent interactions between Tris&#8208;LDHs and poly(acrylamide&#8208;co&#8208;2&#8208;acrylamido&#8208;2&#8208;methyl&#8208;propanesulfonate) (p&#8208;(AM&#8208;co&#8208;AMPS). The swelling and mechanical properties of the resulting hydrogels have been investigated as a function of the ODex and AMPS contents. The as&#8208;prepared hydrogel can swell to 420 times of its original size and retain more than 99.9 wt.% of water. Mechanical tests show that the hydrogel can bear 90 % of compression and is able to be stretched to near 30 times of its original length. Cyclic tensile tests reveal that the hydrogels are capable of self&#8208;recovery and self&#8208;strengthening after mechanical training. The unique energy dissipation mechanism based on the dynamic covalent and non&#8208;covalent interactions is considered to be responsible for the outstanding swelling and mechanical performances.</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling N2 to Ammonia Conversion in Bi2WO6&#8208;Based Materials: A New Avenue in Photocatalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 68, December 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic N2 fixation is an emerging application for ammonia production via sustainable means. N2 gas activation onto the photocatalyst remains a challenge for current researchers. This concept summarizes the latest developments in this field in Bi2WO6&#8208;based photocatalysts for enhancing N2 chemisorption for maximum ammonia production. The final of this concept mentioned the possible problems with false ammonia quantification and how to do rectification.







Abstract
The field of photocatalysis has been evolving since 1972 since Honda and Fujishima's initial push for using light as an energy source to accomplish redox reactions. Since then, many photocatalysts have been studied, semiconductors or otherwise. A new photocatalytic application to convert N2 gas to ammonia (N2 fixation or nitrogen reduction reaction; NRR) has emerged. Many researchers have steered their research in this direction due to developments in the ease of ammonia detection through UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy. This concept will specifically discuss Bi2WO6&#8208;based materials, techniques to enhance their photocatalytic activity (CO2 reduction, H2 production, pollutant removal, etc.), and their current application in photocatalytic NRR. Initially, a brief introduction of Bi2WO6 along with its VB and CB potentials will be compared to various redox potentials. A final topic of interest would be a brief description of photocatalytic nitrogen fixation with additional consideration to Bi2WO6&#8208;based materials in N2 fixation. A major problem with photocatalytic NRR is the false ammonia quantification in Bi&#8208;based materials, which will be discussed in detail and also ways to minimize them.

The synthesis of [(Me3Si)2CH]2E=PMes* (E=Ge, Sn) from the reaction of the tetrylenes with a phospha&#8208;Wittig reagent is described. Reactivity studies reveal that they are capable of undergoing hydroelementation reactions across the E=P bond and of acting as masked phosphinidene sources.







Abstract
We describe the facile synthesis of [(Me3Si)2CH]2E=PMes* (E=Ge, Sn) from the reaction of the tetrylenes with the phospha&#8208;Wittig reagent, Me3P&#8722;PMes*. Their reactivity towards a range of substrates with protic and hydridic E&#8722;H bonds (E=N, O, Si) is described. In addition to hydroelementation reactions of the E=P bonds, we show that these compounds, particularly [(Me3Si)2CH]2Sn=PMes*, also act as base&#8208;stabilized phosphinidenes, allowing phosphinidene transfer to other nucleophiles.

         <title>Solvent Acts as the Referee in a Match&#8208;Up Between Charged and Preorganized Receptors</title>

Solvent dependent binding: Herein, a cationic receptor was employed to quantify chloride binding in solvents of differing polarity and draw comparison to a neutral, preorganized macrocycle. As expected, ion&#8208;ion attraction leads to stronger binding but only in low&#8208;polarity dichloromethane. Unexpectedly, the neutral receptor wins the competition for binding in polar solvents due to being preorganized.







Abstract
The prevalence of anion&#8208;cation contacts in biomolecular recognition under aqueous conditions suggests that ionic interactions should dominate the binding of anions in solvents across both high and low polarities. Investigations of this idea using titrations in low polarity solvents are impaired by interferences from ion pairing that prevent a clear picture of binding. To address this limitation and test the impact of ion&#8208;ion interactions across multiple solvents, we quantified chloride binding to a cationic receptor after accounting for ion pairing. In these studies, we created a chelate receptor using aryl&#8208;triazole CH donors and a quinolinium unit that directs its cationic methyl inside the binding pocket. In low&#8208;polarity dichloromethane, the 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex (log K1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ~ 7.3) is more stable than neutral chelates, but fortuitously comparable to a preorganized macrocycle (log K1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ~ 6.9). Polar acetonitrile and DMSO diminish stabilities of the charged receptor (log K1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ~ 3.7 and 1.9) but surprisingly 100&#8208;fold more than the macrocycle. While both receptors lose stability by dielectric screening of electrostatic stability, the cationic receptor also pays additional costs of organization. Thus even though the charged receptor has stronger binding in apolar solvents, the uncharged receptor has more anion affinity in polar solvents.

         <title>Second Generation of Near&#8208;Infrared Cyanine&#8208;Based Photocatalysts for Faster Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 68, December 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A second generation of cyanine&#8208;based near&#8208;infrared photocatalysts has been developed to accelerate organic transformations. Cyanines were prepared and fully characterized prior to evaluation of their photocatalytic activities in oxidation (aza&#8208;Henry reaction) and reduction (trifluoromethylation of alkene).







Abstract
A second generation of cyanine&#8208;based near&#8208;infrared photocatalysts has been developed to accelerate organic transformations. Cyanines were prepared and fully characterized prior to evaluation of their photocatalytic activities. Catalyst efficiency was determined by using two model oxidation and reduction reactions. For the aza&#8208;Henry reaction, cyanines bearing an amino group on the heptamethine chain led to the best results. For trifluoromethylation, the stability of the photocatalyst was found to be the key parameter for efficient and rapid conversion.

         <title>Highly Flexible and Self&#8208;Healing Supercapacitor Enabled by Physically Crosslinking Polymer Hydrogel Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 68, December 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogel with outstanding mechanical properties and self&#8208;healing ability based on poly N&#8208;hydroxyethyl acrylamide (PHEAA) is fabricated as electrolyte for supercapacitors. The supercapacitor is obtained with flexibility and self&#8208;healing ability, retaining 80&#8201;% specific capacitance after five cutting&#8208;healing cycles. Three supercapacitors in series could drive a parallel circuit of LED and clock.







Abstract
Preparation of flexible supercapacitors with excellent mechanical properties and self&#8208;healing properties is of great significance but still remains a challenge. A self&#8208;healable conductive hydrogel based on poly N&#8208;hydroxyethyl acrylamide (PHEAA) is fabricated as electrolyte for supercapacitors. The design of the physically cross&#8208;linked dual network, and rich hydrogen bonds endow the hydrogel with robust mechanical properties and strong self&#8208;healing ability. The hydrogel exhibited an excellent stretchability (723&#8201;%) and a high ionic conductivity (21.8&#8197;mS/cm). Specially, by in&#8197;situ growth of electrode film, a non&#8208;laminated supercapacitor is obtained with flexibility and self&#8208;healing ability. Due to the non&#8208;laminated structure, the supercapacitor can work stably under bending and punching. The supercapacitor possessed an areal capacitance of 253.1&#8197;mF/cm2 and the capacitance retention was 80&#8201;% after five cutting&#8208;healing cycles. The pseudo&#8208;capacitance contribution of the supercapacitor after self&#8208;healing was discussed. It is noteworthy that the supercapacitor maintains the ability to power a clock after self&#8208;healing.

         <title>Chiral TPE Foldamers in Macrocycles: Aggregation Enhanced Emission and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 68, December 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral TPE foldamers were first constructed through macrocycle architectonics and the chiroptical properties were investigated. Aggregation enhanced emission and unusual circularly polarized luminescence can be discovered due to the folded conformation.







Abstract
Chiral macrocycles with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) have attracted increasing attention due to the rigid structure, symmetrical chiral geometry and large luminescence dissymmetry factors (glum). However, most chiral macrocycles are more emissive in solutions but have weakened fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;F) in aggregates, limiting their further application. In this paper, chiral macrocycle R/S&#8208;PhTPE was synthesized by combining chiral macrocycle architectonics with Z&#8208;o&#8208;phenyltetraphenylethylene (PhTPE) foldamer. Enhanced solution state emission and characteristic aggregation enhanced emission (AEE) effect can be observed for R/S&#8208;PhTPE due to the folded PhTPE conformation. Macrocycle immobilization and folded conformation endow PhTPE moiety with stable helical conformation. Most importantly, R/S&#8208;PhTPE exhibits opposite CPL signals compared with common chiral TPEs, demonstrating the evident impact of folded conformation. This work reports the first and deep insights into the chiroptical properties of chiral PhTPE foldamers, and will provide a new strategy to tune &#934;F and CPL signals of AIE active chiral macrocycles.

         <title>Yet Another Case of Lithium Metal Atoms and Germanium Atoms Sharing Chemistry in the Solid State: Synthesis and Structural Characterization of Ba2LiGe3</title>

The structure of Ba2Li1&#8722;xGe3+x, emphasizing the honeycomb&#8208;like [Li1&#8722;xGe3+x] layers with Li and Ge atoms (denoted in blue and gold) in a partially disordered state.







Abstract
Several Ba&#8722;Li&#8722;Ge ternary phases are known and structurally characterized, including the title compound Ba2LiGe3. Its structure is reported to contain [Ge6]10&#8722; anions that exhibit delocalized bonding with a H&#252;ckel&#8208;like aromatic character. The Ge atoms are in the same plane with the Li atoms, and if both types of atoms are considered as covalently bonded, [LiGe3]4&#8722; honeycomb&#8208;like layers will result. The latter are separated by slabs of Ba2+ cations. However, based on the systematic work detailed herein, it is necessary to re&#8208;evaluate the phase as Ba2Li1&#8722;xGe3+x (x&lt;0.05). Although small, the homogeneity range is clearly demonstrated in the gradual change of the unit cell for four independent samples. Subsequent characterization by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction methods shows that the Ba2Li1&#8722;xGe3+x structure, responds to the varied number of valence electrons and the changes are most pronounced for the refined lengths of the Li&#8722;Ge and Ge&#8722;Ge bonds. Indirectly, the changes in the Ge&#8722;Li/Ge distances within layers affect the stacking too, and these changes can be correlated to the variation of the c&#8208;cell parameter. Chemical bonding analysis based on TB&#8208;LMTO&#8208;ASA level calculations affirms the notion for covalent character of the Ge&#8722;Ge bonds; the Ba&#8722;Ge and Li&#8722;Ge interactions also show some degree of covalency.

         <title>Porphyrin&#8208;based Bi&#8208;MOFs with Enriched Surface Bi Active Sites for Boosting Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 68, December 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porphyrin&#8208;based Bi&#8208;MOF with enriched surface Bi active sites were obtained by modulating the crystal facet ingeniously. The knitting of Bi active sites onto the porphyrin ligands with the exposure of rich Bi sites can not only ameliorate the light absorption, but also stabilize the catalytic active sites and promote efficient ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer, for significantly ameliorating the performance of photo&#8208;reduction of CO2 to CO and CH4.







Abstract
The inherent challenges in using metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) for photocatalytic CO2 reduction are the combination of wide&#8208;range light harvesting, efficient charge separation and transfer as well as highly exposed catalytic active sites for CO2 activation and reduction. We present here a promising solution to satisfy these requirements together by modulating the crystal facet and surface atomic structure of a porphyrin&#8208;based bismuth&#8208;MOF (Bi&#8208;PMOF). The series of structural and photo&#8208;electronic characterizations together with photocatalytic CO2 reduction experiment collectively establish that the enriched Bi active sites on the (010) surface prefer to promote efficient charge separation and transfer as well as the activation and reduction of CO2. Specifically, the Bi&#8208;PMOFs&#8208;120&#8208;F with enriched surface Bi active sites exhibits optimal photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance to CO (28.61&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1g&#8722;1) and CH4 (8.81&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1g&#8722;1). This work provides new insights to synthesize highly efficient main group p&#8208;block metal Bi&#8208;MOF photocatalysts for CO2 reduction through a facet&#8208;regulation strategy and sheds light on the surface structure&#8208;activity relationships of the MOFs.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks as Tailor&#8208;Made Scaffolds for Water Harvesting</title>

Water harvesting from the air: three covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were synthesized by incorporating different content of nitrogen. Higher nitrogen content is advantageous to lower their inflection points in water isotherms. The high performance of these COFs validated the feasibility of harnessing this strategy to prepare efficient COFs&#8208;based water harvesters.







Abstract
Developing materials to harvest water from the air is of great importance to alleviate the water shortage for people living in arid regions, where the annual average relative humidity (RH) is lower than 0.4. In this work, we report a general nitrogen atom incorporation strategy to prepare high&#8208;performance covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for water harvesting from the air in arid areas. A series of COFs, namely COF&#8208;W1, COF&#8208;W2, and COF&#8208;W3 were developed for this purpose. Different contents of nitrogen were embedded into COFs by incorporating pyridine units into the building blocks. With the increasing content of nitrogen from COF&#8208;W1 to COF&#8208;W3, the inflection points of their water isotherms shift distinctly from RH values from 0.65 to 0.25. Significantly, COF&#8208;W3 exhibits the lowest inflection point at a low RH value of 0.25 and reaches a high uptake capacity of 0.28&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C with a low hysteresis loop. Moreover, the gram&#8208;scale COF&#8208;W3 retains its high performance, which renders it more attractive in water harvesting. This work demonstrates the feasibility of this nitrogen incorporation strategy to acquire high&#8208;performance COFs as water harvesters in the future.

         <title>Long&#8208;range Through&#8208;space Charge Transfer in a pH&#8208;responsive Mixed Cyclophane of Pyridine and Teropyrene</title>

Long&#8208;distance relationship: two aromatic systems do not need to inhabit the same space to maintain a meaningful connection, as evidenced by the long&#8208;range (&gt;5&#8197;&#197;), through&#8208;space charge transfer that arises upon protonation of the pyridine unit in a mixed [3.3]cyclophane containing a rainbow&#8208;shaped teropyrene and a pyridine nested in its arc.







Abstract
A large, strained (SE=44.2&#8197;kcal/mol) and conformationally flexible mixed cyclophane of pyridine and teropyrene was synthesized using two intramolecular Wurtz coupling reactions and an unprecedented Scholl reaction between the unreactive 2 positions of the pyrene systems in a triply bridged pyrenophane. Protonation of the pyridine unit results in a greatly enhanced preference for nesting in the cavity of the highly bent teropyrene system (&#952;calc=162.6&#176;) and emergence of a charge transfer absorption band (&#955;max=592&#8197;nm) due to a long range (5.0&#8211;5.5&#8197;&#197;), through&#8208;space intramolecular transition between the teropyrene and pyridinium units, which does not exist in the neutral cyclophane.

         <title>Geometrically Deformed and Conformationally Rigid Phosphorus Trisamides Featuring an Unsymmetrical Backbone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 68, December 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating a P(III) center in a rigid bicyclic platform offers an attractive way to invoke significant geometric distortion of the phosphorus atom. Current scaffolds are based on a relatively narrow set of ligand platforms. This work focusses on the synthesis as well as versatile oxidation, addition and coordination chemistry of geometrically distorted P(III) species featuring a synthetically modular, nonsymmetric trisamine platform.







Abstract
Nonclassical P(III) centers have attracted much attention in recent years. Incorporating a P(III) center in a rigid bicyclic platform offers a particularly attractive way to invoke significant geometric distortion of the phosphorus atom that may in turn induce unusual reactivity. Although still relatively scarcely explored, phosphorus centers enforced in a non&#8208;C3 symmetry have gained significant traction lately. However, the current scaffolds are based on a relatively limited set of design principles and ligand platforms associated therewith. This work is focussed on the synthesis as well as versatile oxidation, addition and coordination chemistry of a geometrically distorted P(III) species featuring a synthetically modular, nonsymmetric trisamine platform derived from 2&#8208;(methylamino)&#8208;N&#8208;(2&#8208;(methylamino)phenyl)benzenesulfonamide.

         <title>Synthesis and Anticancer Activity of Phosphinoylated and Phosphonoylated N&#8208;Heterocycles Obtained by the Microwave&#8208;Assisted Palladium Acetate&#8208;Catalyzed Hirao Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 68, December 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bromo derivatives of 9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazoles and an indoline were converted to the corresponding phosphonoyl and phosphinoyl derivatives by the microwave&#8208;assisted &#8220;P&#8208;ligand&#8208;free&#8221; Hirao P&#8722;C coupling. A part of the fifteen phosphorylated N&#8208;heterocycles showed significant cytotoxic effect on A549 human non&#8208;small&#8208;cell lung carcinoma and MonoMac&#8208;6 acute monocytic leukemia cell cultures.







Abstract
A literature survey showed that different derivatives with the 9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole or the dihydroindoline scaffold may be of biological activity including cytotoxic effect. Driven by this experience, P&#8208;functionalized derivatives of these N&#8208;heterocycles were synthesized. Three N&#8208;heterocycles, 9&#8208;(4&#8208;bromophenyl)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole, 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole and 1&#8208;(5&#8208;bromoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;one, were coupled with dialkyl phosphites and diarylphosphine oxides using Pd(OAc)2 (10&#8201;%) as the catalyst precursor and triethylamine as the base in ethanol under microwave irradiation. The excess of the Y2P(O)H reagent (Y=alkoxy, aryl) (30&#8201;%) served as the P&#8208;ligand in its trivalent tautomeric form (Y2POH), hence there was no need for the usual P&#8208;ligands meaning cost and environmental burden. Hence, the presented method is a &#8220;green&#8221; approach that proved to be more efficient than the preparation by the traditional method. The products, dialkyl phosphonates and tertiary phosphine oxides obtained in 58&#8211;84&#8201;% yields were characterized, one of them also by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis, and were subjected to in&#8197;vitro biological activity evaluation. A (carbazol)yl&#8208;phenylphosphonate, an N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;(carbazol)yl&#8208;phosphonate, a (carbazol)yl&#8208;phenylphosphine oxide and an N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;(carbazol)ylphosphine oxide revealed a significant cytotoxic activity on A549 human non&#8208;small&#8208;cell lung carcinoma and MonoMac&#8208;6 acute monocytic leukemia cancer cells. The cytotoxic effect was significant as compared to that of the reference compounds.

         <title>A General Strategy for Increasing the Air Stability of Phosphines Including Primary Phosphines</title>

Singling out the singlet: A general approach for increasing the air&#8208;stability of various primary phosphines in the absence of kinetic stabilization is presented based on the quenching of singlet oxygen. It proves singlet oxygen to be the key initiator in the oxidation of phosphines.







Abstract
A general approach for increasing the air&#8208;stability of various primary phosphines in the absence of kinetic stabilization is presented that contrasts with previous interpretations, which were limited to specific phosphines. This contribution shows the synthesis of a series of air&#8208;stable primary phosphines Fc(CH2)nPH2, where n=0,1,2,3; and Fc=ferrocenyl, and their corresponding isolable primary phosphine oxides. It was demonstrated that the ferrocene moiety exerts an antioxidant effect on the primary phosphine group, which is intermolecular, solvent dependent and increases with the electron density on the ferrocene moiety. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the presence of ferrocene in solution also inhibits the oxidation of other secondary and tertiary phosphines in air. Together our findings suggest that quenching of singlet oxygen is the actual reason for the antioxidant effect; this was experimentally confirmed by using other established singlet oxygen quenchers, thus demonstrating a key role of singlet oxygen in the aerobic oxidation of phosphines.

         <title>Structure and Flexibility of Copper&#8208;Modified DNA G&#8208;Quadruplexes Investigated by 19F ENDOR Experiments at 34&#8197;GHz

19F ENDOR&#8208;based distance measurements at 34&#8197;GHz report on the structure and flexibility of DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes. Our findings show that measuring precise distances at 34&#8197;GHz is feasible without the loss of sensitivity and resolution.







Abstract
DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (GQs) are of great interest due to their involvement in crucial biological processes such as telomerase maintenance and gene expression. Furthermore, they are reported as catalytically active DNAzymes and building blocks in bio&#8208;nanotechnology. GQs exhibit remarkable structural diversity and conformational heterogeneity, necessitating precise and reliable tools to unravel their structure&#8208;function relationships. Here, we present insights into the structure and conformational flexibility of a unimolecular GQ with high spatial resolution via electron&#8208;nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) experiments combined with Cu(II) and fluorine labeling. These findings showcase the successful application of the 19F&#8208;ENDOR methodology at 34&#8197;GHz, overcoming the limitations posed by the complexity and scarcity of higher&#8208;frequency spectrometers. Importantly, our approach retains both sensitivity and orientational resolution. This integrated study not only enhances our understanding of GQs but also expands the methodological toolbox for studying other macromolecules.

         <title>Polymorphism and Light&#8208;Driven Forward Movement of TPE Derivative Micro&#8208;Crystal due to ArH&#8208;pi Interactions Difference</title>

New TPE derivatives bearing p&#8208;AP groups: Among 5 kinds of crystals of TPE derivative, it is found for the first time that strong intermolecular ArH&#8208;pi interactions cause ACQ effect while weak ArH&#8208;pi interactions induce AIE phenomenon. The interactions also arouse photochromism, photodeformation and even the first forward rolling movement of crystal by UV light irradiation, providing promising materials in multimode anti&#8208;counterfeiting, photo&#8208;actuator and light&#8208;driven micro&#8208;vehicle.







Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) and aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) are two classes of opposite luminescence phenomena. It is almost impossible to show both AIE and ACQ effect simultaneously by the same molecule. However, here we report that a simple TPE derivative TAP&#8208;TPE grows into both AIE crystals and ACQ ones. It is found that equatorial, contact distance&#8208;longer and weak ArH&#8208;&#960; interactions exist in AIE crystals while vertical, contact distance&#8208;shorter and strong ArH&#8208;&#960; interactions appear in ACQ crystals. Theoretical calculation of electron density on the interaction atoms unveils that ACQ crystals have much larger change in electron density than AIE ones, suggesting that the intermolecular electron transfer aroused by the strong ArH&#8208;&#960; hydrogen bonds leads to ACQ phenomenon. This result provides a new insight into the emission mechanism in aggregation state. Interestingly, due to the ArH&#8208;pi interactions difference, only one of five kinds of crystals shows rapid photochromism, and can act as multimode anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials. Very exceptionally, for the first time we find that the photochromic micrometric rod&#8208;like crystal even makes forward rolling movement as it repeatedly bends and straightens by responding to on and off of the ultraviolet light irradiation, displaying potential for photo&#8208;actuator and light&#8208;driven micro&#8208;vehicle.

         <title>Molecular Recognition Process in Resorcinarene&#8208;based Coordination Capsules</title>

Cu and Ag capsules accommodate various organic molecules. We investigated the processes by which these capsules perform molecular recognition utilizing a molecular probe. It was found that partial dissociation is a major molecular recognition process, while in some cases, slippage also contributes to host&#8208;guest complexation.







Abstract
Cu and Ag capsules can take up various organic molecules. Their molecular recognition possibly involves partial dissociation and slippage. We investigated molecular recognition processes in the Cu and Ag capsules by CD and 1H NMR spectroscopy and employed 4,4&#8217;&#8208;diacetoxy biphenyl carrying two benzothiadiazole groups as a probe. CD and 1H NMR measurements reveal that the host&#8208;guest complexation proceeds under second&#8208;order reactions and that these capsules undergo the partial dissociation to take up the probe in [D1]chloroform and [D8]THF. The slippage also contributes to host&#8208;guest complexation for a Cu capsule that carries p&#8208;methoxyphenyl groups on the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridiyl arms. DFT calculations suggest that &#960;/&#960; stacking interactions between the electron&#8208;rich p&#8208;methoxyphenyl group and the electron&#8208;poor 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridyl arm elongate the capsule, allowing the guest to access the cavity without the partial dissociation.

         <title>A Living Topochemical Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Achiral Amino Acid N&#8208;Carboxy&#8208;Anhydrides in Single Crystals</title>

The single&#8208;crystal ring&#8208;opening polymerization of &#945;&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid&#8208; (Aib) and 1&#8208;aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid&#8208; (ACHC) N&#8208;carboxyanhydrides (NCAs) is reported. Topochemical, living ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of these achiral amino&#8208;acid NCAs produces polymers of highest purity with increased chain length and high end&#8208;group fidelity as compared to conventional solution polymerization.







Abstract
A living topochemical ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of achiral amino&#8208;acid N&#8208;carboxyanhydrides (NCAs) is reported. Single crystals of the NCAs of &#945;&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) and 1&#8208;aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid (ACHC) were grown, allowing a ring&#8208;opening polymerization macroscopically induced by amines. The single crystals could be polymerized at temperatures from 25&#8211;50&#8201;&#176;C after physically contacting the amine&#8208;based initiator with the crystals. Topochemical polymerization of the crystals was proven by MALDI&#8208;ToF MS and XRD, generating polymers with chain lengths of up to 40&#8197;units and a complete affixation of the initiating amine at the polymer's head. Due to the proper alignment of the reacting groups in the crystal, longer polymer chains with improved purities can be reached, as chain&#8208;transfer is reduced as compared to solution polymerization. Simple purification of the polymers can be achieved by separation of the unreacted NCA via dispersion in acetonitrile. Overall, this method enables the preparation of polymers with higher chain length and purities at mild conditions, finally demonstrating a crystal&#8208;based ring opening polymerization.

Photophysical properties of homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;aggregate: SEM image of homo&#8208;aggregated system (helical&#8208;shaped) of a covalently&#8208;linked dyad made of photoactive N&#8208;annulated perylene dyes and methylviologen electron acceptor units (P&#8208;MV). Hetero&#8208;aggregated systems containing P dye and P&#8208;MV dyad are also formed in appropriate conditions and the light absorbed by P contributes to photoinduced charge separation within the P&#8208;MV components.







Abstract
We report the absorption spectra and photophysical properties of homo and hetero&#8208;aggregate assemblies of a strongly emissive N&#8208;annulated perylene dye (P) and of a dyad made of P and a methyl viologen derivative (P&#8208;MV), in ethanol&#8208;water solutions. In homo&#8208;aggregate assemblies of P, the &#960;&#8208;&#960;* fluorescence of the isolated chromophore is replaced by excimer emission at lower energy, with a lifetime of 900&#8197;ps, due to excimer formation from the initially prepared excitons. In homo&#8208;aggregate assemblies of P&#8208;MV, photoinduced charge separation, with formation of P+&#8208;MV&#8722; species, occurs in 3&#8197;ps with a charge recombination of 20&#8197;ps. In hetero&#8208;aggregate P/P&#8208;MV systems, the light energy absorbed by the P components delocalizes over various P subunits, and when a P&#8208;MV unit is reached, charge separation occurs; however, excimer emission is present for P/P&#8208;MV ratio larger than 3&#8201;:&#8201;1, indicating that delocalized excitons within the hetero&#8208;aggregate systems extend over a limited number of P chromophores.

Noble&#8208;metal nanoboxes offer an attractive form of nanomaterials for catalytic applications owing to their open structure and highly efficient use of atoms. Herein, we report the facile synthesis of Ag&#8722;Ru core&#8722;shell nanocubes and then Ru nanoboxes with a hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) structure, as well as evaluation of their catalytic activity toward a model hydrogenation reaction. By adding a solution of Ru(acac)3 in ethylene glycol (EG) dropwise to a suspension of silver nanocubes in EG at 170&#8201;&#176;C, Ru atoms are generated and deposited onto the entire surface of a nanocube. As the volume of the RuIII precursor is increased, Ru atoms are also produced through a galvanic replacement reaction, generating Ag&#8722;Ru nanocubes with a hollow interior. The released Ag+ ions are then reduced by EG and deposited back onto the nanocubes. By selectively etching away the remaining Ag with aqueous HNO3, the as&#8208;obtained Ag&#8722;Ru nanocubes are transformed into Ru nanoboxes, whose walls are characterized by an hcp structure and an ultrathin thickness of a few nanometers. Finally, we evaluated the catalytic properties of the Ru nanoboxes with two different wall thicknesses by using a model hydrogenation reaction; both samples showed excellent performance.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Properties on a Bisbenzofuropyrazine Core: Mechanochromism and Concentration&#8208;Controlled Vapochromism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 68, December 6, 2023. </description>

A novel &#960;&#8208;core system: bent&#8208;shaped bisbenzofuropyrazines were easily synthesized by the palladium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular double cyclization reaction. The unsubstituted derivative shows good solubility in spite of its rigid planar structure and provides three polymorphs with different mechanochromic luminescent properties. A ground sample of the sec&#8208;butylated derivative exhibits concentration&#8208;dependent unique vapochromic luminescent behavior.







Abstract
Stimulus&#8208;responsive organic materials with luminescence switching properties have attracted considerable attention for their practical applications in sensing, security, and display devices. In this paper, bent&#8208;type bisbenzofuropyrazine derivatives, Bent&#8208;H and Bent&#8208;sBu, with good solubilities were synthesized, and their physical and optical properties were investigated in detail. Bent&#8208;H gave three crystalline polymorphs, and they showed different luminescence properties depending on their crystal packing structures. In addition, Bent&#8208;H exhibited mechanochromic luminescence in spite of its rigid skeleton. Bent&#8208;sBu exhibited unique concentration&#8208;dependent vapochromic luminescence. Ground Bent&#8208;sBu was converted to blue&#8208;emissive, green&#8208;emissive, and green&#8208;emissive high&#8208;viscosity solution states at low, moderate, and high concentrations of CHCl3 vapor, respectively. This finding represents a concentration&#8208;dependent multi&#8208;phase transition with an organic solvent, which is of potent interest for application in sensing systems.

         <title>Cd/Cd(OH)2 Nanosheets Enhancing the Electrocatalytic Activity of CO2 Reduction to CO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 68, December 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cd/Cd(OH)2/CP electrode could efficiently electrocatalytic reduce CO2 to CO in CO2&#8208;saturated 30&#8197;wt% [Bmim]PF6&#8208;65&#8197;wt% CH3CN&#8208;5&#8197;wt% H2O electrolyte. The outstanding electrocatalytic performance of the Cd/Cd(OH)2/CP electrode was closely associated with its unique structural properties, suitable OH groups, perfect interaction with electrolyte, abundant active sites and fast electron transfer rate.







Abstract
Electric&#8208;driven conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) to carbon monoxide (CO) under mild reaction conditions offers a promising approach to mitigate the greenhouse effect and the energy crisis. Surface engineering is believed to be one of the prospective methods for enhancing the electrocatalytic activity of CO2 reduction. Herein, hydroxyl (OH) groups were successfully introduced to cadmium nanosheets to form cadmium and cadmium hydroxide nanocomposites (i.&#8201;e. Cd/Cd(OH)2 nanosheets) via a facile two&#8208;step method. The as&#8208;prepared Cd/Cd(OH)2/CP (CP indicates carbon paper) electrode displays excellent electrocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction to produce CO. The Faradaic efficiency of CO reaches 98.3&#8201;% and the current density achieves 23.8&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;2.0&#8197;V vs. Ag/Ag+ in a CO2&#8208;saturated 30&#8197;wt% 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazole hexafluorophosphate ([Bmim]PF6)&#8208;65&#8197;wt% acetonitrile (CH3CN)&#8208;5&#8197;wt% water (H2O) electrolyte. And the CO partial current density can reach up to 71.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with the CO Faradaic efficiency of more than 85&#8201;% at &#8722;2.3&#8197;V vs. Ag/Ag+, which stands out against Cd/CP, Cd(OH)2/CP, and Cd/CdO/CP electrodes. The excellent electrocatalytic performance of the Cd/Cd(OH)2/CP electrode can be attributed to its unique structural properties, suitable OH groups, perfect interaction with electrolyte, abundant active sites and fast electron transfer rate.

         <title>Photoinduced &#945;&#8208;Aminoalkylation of Sulfonylarenes with Alkylamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 68, December 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Aminoalkylation of sulfonylarenes with alkylamines was found to proceed successfully in the presence of a base in MeOH under photoirradiation, giving a wide variety of &#945;&#8208;arylalkylamines. The reaction is initiated by photolysis of the S&#8722;Ar bond of sulfonylarenes leading to generation of &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals, which get into a radical chain to give &#945;&#8208;arylalkylamines.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Aminoalkylation of sulfonylarenes with alkylamines was found to be induced by photoirradiation. Here various types of alkylamines, such as trialkylamines, dialkylamines, N,N&#8208;dialkylanilines and N&#8208;alkylanilines as well as sulfonylarenes containing an azole, azine, heterole or benzene ring are available. The reaction proceeds through a homolytic aromatic substitution (HAS) process consisting of addition of an &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radical to a sulfonylarene and elimination of the sulfonyl radical to give the &#945;&#8208;arylalkylamine, where photoirradiation is considered to induce homolysis of sulfonylarenes leading to the generation of &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals that make a radical chain operative.

Using the popular metal&#8208;ligand axial coordination self&#8208;assembly approach, donor&#8208;acceptor conjugates have been constructed using zinc tetrapyrroles (porphyrin (ZnP), phthalocyanine (ZnPc), and naphthalocyanine (ZnNc)) as electron donors and imidazole functionalized tetracyanobutadiene (Im&#8208;TCBD) and cyclohexa&#8208;2,5&#8208;diene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diylidene&#8208;expanded&#8208;tetracyanobutadiene (Im&#8208;DCNQ) as electron acceptors. The newly formed donor&#8208;acceptor conjugates were fully characterized by a suite of physicochemical methods, including absorption and emission, electrochemistry, and computational methods. The measured binding constants for the 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complexes were in the order of 104&#8211;105&#8197;M&#8722;1 in o&#8208;dichlorobenzene. Free&#8208;energy calculations and the energy level diagrams revealed the high exergonicity for the excited state electron transfer reactions. However, in the case of the ZnNc:Im&#8208;DCNQ complex, owing to the facile oxidation of ZnNc and facile reduction of Im&#8208;DCNQ, slow electron transfer was witnessed in the dark without the aid of light. Systematic transient pump&#8208;probe studies were performed to secure evidence of excited state charge separation and gather their kinetic parameters. The rate of charge separation was as high as 1011&#8197;s&#8722;1 suggesting efficient processes. These findings show that the present self&#8208;assembly approach could be utilized to build donor&#8208;acceptor constructs with powerful electron acceptors, TCBD and DCNQ, to witness ground and excited state charge transfer, fundamental events required in energy harvesting, and building optoelectronic devices.

The synthesis and structure of the first alkaline bismolyl contact ion pair [K(18&#8208;c&#8208;6)]+[Bitet]&#8722; and the corresponding yttrium bismolyl complex (Cptet2Y)2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;1&#8208;Bitet)2 are presented. Density Functional Theory calculations of the bismolyl anion revealed that the bismuth atom is in the +1 oxidation state and possesses a dominant mesomeric structure (50&#8201;%) where two lone pairs of electrons reside at the BiI center. Remarkably, the yttrium&#8208;bismuth bonding interaction is with 16.6&#8201;% at the yttrium center, which is large in rare earth chemistry. Bitet=[C4Me4Bi].







Abstract
The synthesis and first structural characterization of the [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)] bismolyl Bitet (C4Me4Bi) contact ion pair (1) is presented. Notably, according to Natural Resonance Theory calculations, the Bitet anion of 1 features two types of leading mesomeric structures with localized anionic charge and two lone pairs of electrons at the BiI center, as well as delocalized anionic charge in the &#960;&#8208;conjugated C4Bi ring. The lone pairs at Bi enable a unique bridging coordination mode of the bismolyl ligand, as shown for the first rare earth metal bismolyl complex (Cptet2Y)2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;1&#8208;Bitet)2 (2). The latter results from the salt metathesis reaction of KBitet with Cptet2Y(BPh4) (Cptet=C5Me4H). The Y&#8208;Bi bonding interaction in 2 of 16.6&#8201;% covalency at yttrium is remarkably large.

Keying Pd&#8208;catalyzed dearomative spirocyclization of bromofuran with N&#8208;tosylhydrazone, followed by a tandem reaction, concise synthesis of C11&#8208;oxygenated Cephalotaxus alkaloids, fortuneicyclidins A and B, and cephalotine B was accomplished.







Abstract
Total syntheses of C11&#8208;oxygenated Cephalotaxus alkaloids, fortuneicyclidins A and B, and cephalotine B, were achieved. The key for the synthesis is a Pd&#8208;catalyzed dearomative spirocyclization of bromofurans with N&#8208;tosylhydrazones, followed by acid&#8208;mediated tandem transformation to construct the tetracyclic skeleton with the C11&#8208;oxygen functional group. Chemo&#8208;selective and catalytic functional group conversions of the tetracyclic intermediate completed the synthesis of fortuneicyclidins and cephalotine B in 8 and 9 steps, respectively.

         <title>Dynamic and Assembly Characteristics of Deep&#8208;Cavity Basket Acting as a Host for Inclusion Complexation of Mitoxantrone in Biotic and Abiotic Systems</title>

         <dc:description>
Deep&#8208;cavity baskets are novel, accessible, modular, and biocompatible hosts. With intriguing conformational dynamics, assembly characteristics and great capacity to bind anticancer drug mitoxantrone, deep&#8208;cavity baskets hold promise for developing antidotes as a countermeasure against a broad range of aromatic toxicants in complex biological systems.







Abstract
We describe the preparation, dynamic, assembly characteristics of vase&#8208;shaped basket 13&#8722; along with its ability to form an inclusion complex with anticancer drug mitoxantrone in abiotic and biotic systems. This novel cavitand has a deep nonpolar pocket consisting of three naphthalimide sides fused to a bicyclic platform at the bottom while carrying polar glycines at the top. The results of 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), 1H&#8197;NMR Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST), Calorimetry, Hybrid Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics (REMD), and Microcrystal Electron Diffraction (MicroED) measurements are in line with 1 forming dimer [12]6&#8722;, to be in equilibrium with monomers 1(R)3&#8722; (relaxed) and 1(S)3&#8722; (squeezed). Through simultaneous line&#8208;shape analysis of 1H&#8197;NMR data, kinetic and thermodynamic parameters characterizing these equilibria were quantified. Basket 1(R)3&#8722; includes anticancer drug mitoxantrone (MTO2+) in its pocket to give stable binary complex [MTO&#8834;1]&#8722; (Kd=2.1&#8197;&#956;M) that can be precipitated in&#8197;vitro with UV light or pH as stimuli. Both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo studies showed that the basket is nontoxic, while at a higher proportion with respect to MTO it reduced its cytotoxicity in&#8197;vitro. With well&#8208;characterized internal dynamics and dimerization, the ability to include mitoxantrone, and biocompatibility, the stage is set to develop sequestering agents from deep&#8208;cavity baskets.

         <title>Vanadium(V) Pyridine&#8208;Containing Schiff Base Catecholate Complexes are Lipophilic, Redox&#8208;Active and Selectively Cytotoxic in Glioblastoma (T98G) Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 68, December 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vanadium(V) catecholates are promising agents for intratumoral injections to treat glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer. We report a novel promising analog abbreviated [VO(SALIEP)(DTB)] that is highly selective towards glioblastoma cells and nontoxic to normal cells due to the presence of the pyridine ring on the Schiff base. This is the first structure&#8208;activity study to establish this scaffold, which allows high toxicity against glioblastoma (T98G) cells.







Abstract
Two new series of complexes with pyridine&#8208;containing Schiff bases, [VVO(SALIEP)L] and [VVO(Cl&#8208;SALIEP)L] (SALIEP=N&#8208;(salicylideneaminato)&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethylpyridine; Cl&#8208;SALIEP=N&#8208;(5&#8208;chlorosalicylideneaminato)&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl)pyridine, L=catecholato(2&#8722;) ligand) have been synthesized. Characterization by 1H and 51V&#8197;NMR and UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopies confirmed that: 1)&#8197;most complexes form two major geometric isomers in solution, and [VVO(SALIEP)(DTB)] (DTB=3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcatecholato(2&#8722;)) forms two isomers that equilibrate in solution; and 2)&#8197;tert&#8208;butyl substituents were necessary to stabilize the reduced VIV species (EPR spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry). The pyridine moiety within the Schiff base ligands significantly changed their chemical properties with unsubstituted catecholate ligands compared with the parent HSHED (N&#8208;(salicylideneaminato)&#8208;N&#8242;&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)&#8208;1,2&#8208;ethanediamine) Schiff base complexes. Immediate reduction to VIV occurred for the unsubstituted&#8208;catecholato VV complexes on dissolution in DMSO. By contrast, the pyridine moiety within the Schiff base significantly improved the hydrolytic stability of [VVO(SALIEP)(DTB)] compared with [VVO(HSHED)(DTB)]. [VVO(SALIEP)(DTB)] had moderate stability in cell culture media. There was significant cellular uptake of the intact complex by T98G (human glioblastoma) cells and very good anti&#8208;proliferative activity (IC50 6.7&#177;0.9&#8197;&#956;M, 72&#8197;h), which was approximately five times higher than for the non&#8208;cancerous human cell line, HFF&#8208;1 (IC50 34&#177;10&#8197;&#956;M). This made [VVO(SALIEP)(DTB)] a potential drug candidate for the treatment of advanced gliomas by intracranial injection.

In a desert oasis landscape, comprising pyramids of elemental bismuth, the first crystallographically characterized bismolyl ligand as a potassium salt is depicted. Excitingly, two of these anionic ligands bridge two yttrium metallocene cations to give the first rare&#8208;earth bismolyl complex. The lone pairs on bismuth lead to significant Y&#8722;Bi covalent bonding interactions. The yttrium bismolyl complex is redox active, portrayed through the cyclic voltammogram emerging through a sand dune. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Demir and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302687).

         <dc:description>
Through dearomative spirocyclization of a furan and N&#8208;tosylhydrazone with palladium catalysis, concise syntheses of cephalotaxus alkaloids, fortuneicyclidins A and B, and cephalotine&#8197;B have been accomplished. These natural products have a highly fused polycyclic skeleton including an azaspirocycle. By orchestrating the dearomative azaspirocyclization and a tandem reaction to construct the main skeleton, these natural products can be reached in only eight or nine steps. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Uwabe, K. Muto and J. Yamaguchi (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302769).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Through dearomative spirocyclization&lt;/b&gt; of a furan and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-tosylhydrazone with palladium catalysis, concise syntheses of cephalotaxus alkaloids, fortuneicyclidins A and B, and cephalotine&#8197;B have been accomplished. These natural products have a highly fused polycyclic skeleton including an azaspirocycle. By orchestrating the dearomative azaspirocyclization and a tandem reaction to construct the main skeleton, these natural products can be reached in only eight or nine steps.

         <title>Bioinspired Hydrophobicity for Enhancing Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 68, December 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The local CO2 concentration matters for electrochemical CO2 reduction in terms of the activity and selectivity. This review summarizes the bioinspired hydrophobicity design of catalysts and other strategies including catalysts modification, electrolytes selection, and electrolyzers engineering for CO2 enrichment to realize enhanced CO2R performance. This review is expected to provide a guidance for the development of practical electrocatalytic CO2R systems.







Abstract
Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (CO2R) is a promising pathway for converting greenhouse gasses into valuable fuels and chemicals using intermittent renewable energy. Enormous efforts have been invested in developing and designing CO2R electrocatalysts suitable for industrial applications at accelerated reaction rates. The microenvironment, specifically the local CO2 concentration (local [CO2]) as well as the water and ion transport at the CO2&#8211;electrolyte&#8211;catalyst interface, also significantly impacts the current density, Faradaic efficiency (FE), and operation stability. In nature, hydrophobic surfaces of aquatic arachnids trap appreciable amounts of gases due to the &#8220;plastron effect&#8221;, which could inspire the reliable design of CO2R catalysts and devices to enrich gaseous CO2. In this review, starting from the wettability modulation, we summarize CO2 enrichment strategies to enhance CO2R. To begin, superwettability systems in nature and their inspiration for concentrating CO2 in CO2R are described and discussed. Moreover, other CO2 enrichment strategies, compatible with the hydrophobicity modulation, are explored from the perspectives of catalysts, electrolytes, and electrolyzers, respectively. Finally, a perspective on the future development of CO2 enrichment strategies is provided. We envision that this review could provide new guidance for further developments of CO2R toward practical applications.

         <title>Enhanced Hydroxyl Adsorption in Ultrathin NiO/Cr2O3 In&#8208;Plane Heterostructures for Efficient Alkaline Methanol Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple topotactic transformation strategy is presented to construct ultrathin in&#8208;plane heterostructures as a desired platform for tailoring the d band centers and further electrocatalytic performance of catalysts. Both the theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the NiO/Cr2O3 in&#8208;plane heterointerface is more active toward alkaline methanol oxidation, which may hold great promise in the field of electrocatalysis.







Abstract
The exploration of advanced nickel&#8208;based electrocatalysts for alkaline methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) holds immense promise for value&#8208;added organic products coupled with hydrogen production, but still remain challenging. Herein, we construct ultrathin NiO/Cr2O3 in&#8208;plane heterostructures to promote the alkaline MOR process. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that NiO/Cr2O3 in&#8208;plane heterostructures enable a favorable upshift of the d&#8208;band center and enhanced adsorption of hydroxyl species, leading to accelerated generation of active NiO(OH)ads species. Furthermore, ultrathin in&#8208;plane heterostructures endow the catalyst with good charge transfer ability and adsorption behavior of methanol molecules onto catalytic sites, contributing to the improvement of alkaline MOR kinetics. As a result, ultrathin NiO/Cr2O3 in&#8208;plane heterostructures exhibit a remarkable MOR activity with a high current density of 221&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.6&#8197;V vs Ag/AgCl, which is 7.1&#8208;fold larger than that of pure NiO nanosheets and comparable with other highly active catalysts reported so far. This work provides an effectual strategy to optimize the activity of nickel&#8208;based catalysts and highlights the dominate efficacy of ultrathin in&#8208;plane heterostructures in alkaline MOR.

Abstract
Allyl sulfones are an essential pharmacophore in many bioactive compounds. To combat their synthetic barrier, we report a practical, straightforward organophotocatalyzed methodology for accessing miscellaneously functionalized allyl sulfone derivatives using inexpensive and bench&#8208;stable sodium sulfinate salts under mild conditions. This photo&#8208;catalyzed radical sulfonylation provides access to a variety of allyl sulfones in good to excellent yields with high E&#8201;:&#8201;Z selectivity. A wide range of vinyl cyclopropanes, as well as aryl/hetero and alkyl sodium sulfinates, were tolerated and reliable in gram&#8208;scale synthesis. Later on, further functionalization of allyl sulfones was demonstrated. A plausible mechanism for radical sulfonylation is proposed from the control experiments.

         <title>Luminescent Chiral Furanol&#8208;PAHs via Straightforward Ni&#8208;Catalysed Csp2&#8722;F Functionalization: Mechanistic Insights into the Scholl Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One step Ni&#8208;catalysed Csp2&#8722;F functionalization afforded aromatic homologation compounds as valid precursors for nanographene and PAH synthesis through the Scholl reaction. By using low acid/oxidant ratios, an unprecedented furanol&#8208;bearing PAHs are obtained and fully characterized, which sheds light into the intricate mechanism of Scholl reaction. Enantiomeric separation of a racemic curved furanol&#8208;PAH is performed.







Abstract
Here we report the stepwise synthesis of new nanographenes (NGs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) obtained via Scholl ring fusion applied at aromatic homologation compounds, which are obtained through one&#8208;step Ni&#8208;catalysed Csp2&#8722;F functionalization. The latter are rapidly accessed valid precursors for the Scholl reaction, and screening of experimental conditions allowed us to describe for the first time furanol&#8208;bearing PAHs. Mechanistic insights are obtained by DFT to rationalize the formation of the furanol PAHs under moderately acidic conditions. All PAHs and NGs synthesized show moderate/weak fluorescent properties, and all PAHs crystallized show some degree of curvature and are obtained as racemic mixtures. Enantiomeric separation by chiral HPLC of one furanol&#8208;bearing PAH allowed the study of their chiroptical CD properties.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;One step Ni-catalysed C&lt;sub&gt;sp2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;F functionalization&lt;/b&gt; afforded aromatic homologation compounds as valid precursors for nanographene and PAH synthesis through the Scholl reaction. By using low acid/oxidant ratios, an unprecedented furanol-bearing PAHs are obtained and fully characterized, which sheds light into the intricate mechanism of Scholl reaction. Enantiomeric separation of a racemic curved furanol-PAH is performed.

         <title>Enantioselective Amination of 3&#8208;Substituted&#8208;2&#8208;benzofuranones via Non&#8208;covalent N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we present an efficient enantioselective amination of 3&#8208;substituted&#8208;2&#8208;benzofuranones utilizing non&#8208;covalent N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis. The process is applicable to various functionalized substrates and it is found to be scalable. Mechanistic investigations based on control experimental and DFT studies suggest that the reaction operates via non&#8208;covalent substrate/NHC interactions.







Abstract
Herein, an efficient method for asymmetric &#945;&#8208;amination of 2&#8208;benzofuranones with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis is reported. The process is based on non&#8208;covalent interaction of NHC with substrate, facilitating the formation of a chiral ion&#8208;pair that encompasses enolate and azolium salt. The activated enolate adds to an electrophilic amine source with sufficient facial control to furnish an enantioenriched product having an amine substituted quaternary stereocenter. The process displays a broad substrate scope. A preparative scale synthesis has been achieved. Preliminary mechanistic investigations based on experimental and DFT studies suggest a reaction pathway that involves non&#8208;covalent substrate/NHC interactions and essentially implicate the role of &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction in diastereomeric transition states for stereo&#8208;chemical discrimination.

         <title>Cu(II) promoted C(sp3)&#8208;H activation in unactivated cycloalkanes: Oxo&#8208;alkylation of styrenes to synthesize &#946;&#8208;disubstituted ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the Cu(II) catalyzed synthesis of &#946;&#8208;disubstituted ketones from styrene via oxo&#8208;alkylation with unactivated cycloalkanes as the alkylating agent in presence of tert&#8208;butylhydroperoxide (TBHP) and 1&#8208;methylimidazole as oxidant and base respectively. &#946;&#8208;disubstituted ketones are known to be synthesized by using either expensive Ru/Ir complexes, or low&#8208;cost metal complexes (e.g., Fe, Mn) with activated species like aldehyde, acid, alcohol, or phthalimide derivatives as the alkylating agent, however, use of unactivated cycloalkanes directly as the alkylating agent remains challenging. A wide range of aliphatic C&#8722;H substrates as well as various olefinic arenes and heteroarene (35 substrates including 14 new substrates) are well&#8208;tolerated in this method. Hammett analysis shed more light on the substitution effect in the olefinic part on the overall mechanism. Furthermore, the controlled experiments, kinetic isotope effect study, and theoretical calculations (DFT) enable us to gain deeper insight of mechanistic intricacies of this new simple and atom&#8208;economic methodology.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Covalently&#8208;linked chromophore&#8211;radical systems with their unique optical and magnetic properties are useful for applications in, e.g., quantum information science. To expand the catalog of molecular systems, we synthesized and characterized six novel chromophore&#8211;radical and radical&#8211;chromophore&#8211;radical systems employing derivatives of perylene diimide (PDI) as the chromophore and trityl as the radical. The EPR properties of these compounds were evaluated in solution at cryogenic and room temperatures. In addition, the electron spin&#8208;spin coupling in the two bistrityl systems was investigated using DQC measurements.

         <dc:description>Abstract: N&#8208;Selective carbamoylation reaction of oximes with isocyanates generates nitrones, which undergo 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition with various dipolarophiles to afford diverse isoxazolidines. Notably, combinations of highly electron&#8208;rich oxime and highly electron&#8208;deficient dipolarophile exhibited high reactivity, with product yields of up to 94%. The substituent on the isoxazolidine&#8208;nitrogen atom could be successfully removed without loss of the cyclic structure. Computational studies have also elucidated the mechanism of the reaction and origin of stereoselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Two Allogons of an O2&#8208;activating Bis(disiloxido)ferrate(II) Accessible Selectively just by Variation of the Crystallization Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deprotonation of O(iPr2SiOH)2 (iPrLH2) with LiOtBu followed by reaction with FeCl2 in THF led to the complex [iPrL2Fe][Li(THF)2]2, 2, which represents a structural and spectroscopic model of the &#945;&#8208;Fe sites of Fe/ZSM&#8208;5. Reaction with O2 in THF solution proceeds rather fast and is complete within 200 ms; an intermediate O2 adduct could not be identified by stopped&#8208;flow methods. Cooling blue solutions of 2 to &#8722;80&#176;C led to the growth of blue crystals of 2.THF, the analysis of which by XRD revealed a FeO4 core that is somewhat distorted from planarity towards a tetrahedral structure. By contrast, cooling such solutions to &#8722;30&#176;C led to pink crystals of an allogon featuring a perfectly square planar FeO4 entity. Hence, 2 represents a unique case where two different structural isomers (allogons) can be crystallized from the same solvent selectively, controlled by the temperature. DFT calculations were performed to understand this finding.</dc:description>

         <title>Trifluoromethyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;dicarbonyls as Versatile Synthons in Synthesis of Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Trifluoromethyl group&#160;relishes a privileged position in the realm of medicinal chemistry because its incorporation into organic molecules often enhances the bioactivity by altering pharmacological profile of molecule. Trifluoromethyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;dicarbonyls have emerged as pivotal building blocks in synthetic organic chemistry due to their facile accessibility, stability and remarkable versatility. Owing to presence of nucleophilic and electrophilic&#160;sites, they offer multifunctional sites for the reaction. This review covers a meticulous exploration of their multifaceted role, encompassing an in&#8208;depth analysis of mechanism, extensive scope, limitations and wide&#8208;ranging applications in diverse organic synthesis, covering the literature from the 21st century.

         <title>Towards Efficient Polymeric Binders for Transition Metal Oxides&#8208;based Li&#8208;ion Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal oxide cathodes&#160;(TMOCs) such as LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 and LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 have been widely employed in Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) owing to superior operating voltages, high reversible capacities and relatively low cost. Nevertheless, despite significant advancements in practical application, TMOC&#8208;based LIBs face great challenges such as transition metal dissolution and volume expansion during cycling, which jeopardizes the future advance of high&#8208;voltage TMOCs. As a critical component of cathode, polymeric binder acts as a crucial part in maintaining the mechanical and ion/electron conductive integrity between active particles, carbon additives, and the aluminum collector, hence minimizing cathode pulverization during battery cycling. Moreover, Polymeric binder with specialized functions is thought to offer a new solution to enhancing the electrochemical stability of the TMOCs. Therefore, this review aims at providing a comprehensive summary of the ideal requirements, design strategies and recent progress of polymeric binders for TMOCs. Future design perspectives and promising research technologies for advanced binders for high&#8208;voltage TMOCs are introduced.</dc:description>

         <title>A Powerful P&#8211;N Connection: Preparative Approaches, Reactivity, and Applications of P&#8208;Stereogenic Aminophosphines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For more than five decades, P&#8208;stereogenic aminophosphine chalcogenides and boranes have attracted scientific attention and are still in the focus of ongoing research. In the last years, novel transition metal&#8208;based synthesis methods have been discovered, in addition to the long&#8208;known use of chiral auxiliaries. Enantiomerically pure compounds with N&#8211;P+&#8211;X&#8208; (X&#160;=&#160;O,&#160;S,&#160;BH3) motifs served as valuable reactive building blocks to provide new classes of organophosphorus derivatives, thereby preserving the stereochemical information at the phosphorus atom. Over the years, intriguing applications in organocatalysis and transition metal catalysis have been reported for some representatives. Asymmetric reductions of C&#9552;C, C&#9552;N, and C&#9552;O double bonds were feasible with selected P&#8208;stereogenic aminophosphine oxides in the presence of hydrogen transfer reagents. P&#8208;stereogenic aminophosphine boranes could be easily deprotected and used as ligands for various transition metals to enable catalytic asymmetric hydrogenations of olefins and imines. This review traces the emergence of a synthetically and catalytically powerful functional compound class with phosphorus&#8208;centered chirality in its main lines, starting from classical approaches to modern synthesis methods to current applications.</dc:description>

         <title>The impact of ortho&#8208;substituents on Bonding in Silver(I) and Halogen(I) complexes of 2&#8208;Mono&#8208; and 2,6&#8208;Disubstituted Pyridines: An In&#8208;depth Experimental and Theoretical Study</title>

         <dc:description>The coordination nature of 2&#8208;mono&#8208; and 2,6&#8208;disubstituted pyridines with electron&#8208;withdrawing halogen and electron&#8208;donating methyl groups for [N&#8211;X&#8211;N]&#8314; (X =I, Br) complexations have been studied using 15N NMR, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The 15N NMR chemical shifts reveal iodine(I) and bromine(I) prefer to form complexes with 2&#8208;substituted pyridines and only 2,6&#8208;dimethylpyridine. The crystalline halogen(I) complexes of 2&#8208;substituted pyridines were characterized by using X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, but 2,6&#8208;dihalopyridines were unable to form stable crystalline halogen(I) complexes due to the lower nucleophilicity of the pyridinic nitrogen. In contrast, the halogen(I) complexes of 2,6&#8208;dimethylpyridine, which has a more basic nitrogen, are characterized by X&#8208;crystallography, which complements the 15N NMR studies. DFT calculations reveal that the bond energies for iodine(I) complexes vary between &#8208;291 and &#8208;351 kJmol&#8208;1 and for bromine between &#8208;370 and &#8208;427 kJmol&#8208;1. The bond energies of halogen(I) complexes of 2&#8208;halopyridines with more nucleophilic nitrogen are 66 &#8208; 76 kJmol&#8208;1 larger than those of analogous 2,6&#8208;dihalopyridines with less nucleophilic nitrogen. The experimental and DFT results show that the electronic influence of ortho&#8208;halogen substituents on pyridinic nitrogen leads to a completely different preference for the coordination bonding of halogen(I) ions, providing new insights into bonding in halogen(I) chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Cucurbit[7]uril&#8208;mediated Histidine Dimerization Exploring the Structure and Binding Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cucurbit[7,8]urils are known to form inclusion complexes with hydrophobic amino acids such as Trp, Tyr, Phe, and Met, as well as peptides containing these residues at the N&#8208;terminus. Despite their widespread use in protein purification, the affinity of histidine (His) for cucurbit[7,8]urils has not been extensively explored. In this study, X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments were conducted to investigate the binding of two histidine moieties to the cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) cavity, resulting in a network of &#960;&#8208;&#960; and hydrogen bonds. This assembly was found to induce a His pKa shift of &#916;pKa=&#8208;4. Histidine weakly bound to CB7 or CB8; however, isothermal titration calorimetry revealed micromolar equilibrium dissociation constant values for CB7 and CB8 when bound to dipeptides containing His at the C&#8208;terminus. Conversely, dipeptides with His at the N&#8208;terminus exhibited millimolar values. Additionally, the His&#8208;Gly&#8208;Gly tripeptide formed a 2:1 complex with CB7. These findings suggest the potential use of histidine and histidine&#8208;containing tags in conjunction with CB7 for various biological applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>While smaller polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes TnRn (POSS) are readily accessible or even commercially available, unambiguously authenticated larger systems (n &gt; 12) have barely been reported. Synthesis and isolation procedures are lengthy, and yields are often very low. Herein, we present the surprisingly straightforward and high&#8208;yielding access to the phenyl&#8208;substituted derivative of a so far only postulated second D3h&#8208;symmetric T14 isomer and with that the largest crystallographically characterized POSS cage with organic substituents. Treatment of the commercially available incompletely condensed T7Ph7(OH)3 silsesquioxane with catalytic amounts of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid results in high yields of the T14Ph14 framework, which is isolated in crystalline form by a simple work&#8208;up. D3h&#8208;T14Ph14 was analyzed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and thermal analysis. The relative energies of all four theoretically possible T14Ph14 isomers were determined by optimization of the corresponding structure using DFT methods.</dc:description>

The rational manipulation of HLCT excited state for efficient emitters remains challenging. Herein, we present three donor&#8210;&#960;&#8210;acceptor (D&#8210;&#960;&#8210;A) molecules (mPAN, mPANPH, and mPNAPH) with phenanthro[9,10&#8208;d]imidazole (PI) and pyridinyl as donor and &#960;&#8208;bridge respectively. Changes in various kinds of polycyclic aromatic derivative acceptors (anthracene, 9&#8208;phenylanthracene, and 1&#8208;phenylnaphthalene) could manipulate the excited states and optoelectronic properties. Theoretical calculations reveal that the S1 state of mPNAPH exhibits HLCT nature while the other two molecules show local excited (LE) state dominated feature. The photophysical properties also demonstrate this characteristic. Therefore, compared with mPAN and mPANPH, mPNAPH has higher photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) whether in solutions or neat films.&#160;Ultimately, the non&#8208;doped devices based on these emitters show high luminance larger than 35000 cd m&#8208;2, and high maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEmaxs) larger than 5% with low efficiency roll&#8208;off. In particular, the mPNAPH&#8208;based device displays an excellent performance of pure blue emission at 456 nm with Commission Internationale de L&#8217;Eclairage coordinate of (0.15, 0.16) and EQEmax of 6.13% that benefited from the HLCT state and high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing process.</dc:description>

         <title>Ferroelectricity and related properties of nitratecadmate(II) hybrid with metal&#8208;vacancy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All crystals are not ideal, and many of their properties are often determined not by the regular arrangement of atoms, but by the irregular arrangement of crystal defects. Many properties of materials can be controlled effectively by proper use of solid defects. By substitution of NH4+ ion of a hexagonal perovskite structure (H2dabco)(NH4)(NO3)3 (dabco = 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, 1) with Cd2+ ion, we obtained a new metal&#8208;vacancy compound (H2dabco)2Cd(H2O)2(NO3)6 (2). It exhibits a ferroelectric&#8208;paraelectric phase transition at 261 K. A comparison of the various&#8208;temperature single&#8208;crystal structures indicates that the coordination twist of Cd2+ ion leads to instability of the lattices and excellent ferroelectricity. This finding reveals that the vacancy can be utilized as an element to produce ferroelectricity and may start the chemistry of metal&#8208;vacancy coordination compounds. This finding reveals that the vacancy can be utilized as an effective means to tune the symmetry and produce ferroelectricity.</dc:description>

         <title>Capturing&#160;Sialyl&#8208;glycan on Live Cancer Cells by Tailored Boronopeptide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boronic acid&#8208;containing molecules are substantially popularized in chemical biology and medicinal chemistry due to the broad spectrum of covalent conjugations as well as interaction modules offered by the versatile boron atom. Apparently, the WGA peptide (wheat germ agglutinin, 62&#8208;73), which shows a considerably low binding affinity to sialic acid, turned into a selective and &gt;5 folds potent binder with the aid of a suitable boronic acid probe installed chemoselectively. In silico studies prompted us to install BA probes on the cysteine residue, supposedly located in close proximity to the bound sialic acid. In vitro studies revealed that the tailored boronopeptides show enhanced binding ability due to the synergistic recognition governed by selective non&#8208;covalent interactions and cis&#8208;diol boronic acid conjugation. The intense binding is observed even in 10% serum, thus enabling profiling of sialyl&#8208;glycan on cancer cells, as compared with the widely used lectin, Sambucus nigra. The synergistic binding mode between the best boronopeptide (P3) binder and sialic acid was analyzed via 1H and 11B NMR.</dc:description>

         <title>Ferrocenyl Dinuclear Gold(I) Complexes. Study of their Structural Features and the Influence of Bridging and Phosphane Ligands in a Catalytic Cyclization Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of the ferrocene moiety with gold(I) catalysis remains a relatively unexplored field. In this article, we delve into the synthesis, characterization, and potential catalytic activity of four complexes utilizing both monodentate and bidentate ferrocenyl diphenylphosphane ligands (ppf and dppf), coordinated with two gold(I) metal centers, linked by either chloride or pentafluorophenylthiolate bridging ligands. This leads to the formation of cationic "self&#8208;activated" precatalysts capable of initiating the catalytic cycle without the need for external additives. The catalytic activity of these complexes was assessed through a model reaction in gold(I) catalysis, specifically the cyclization of a N&#8208;propargylbenzamide to produce an oxazole. In addition, we studied and compared the influence exerted by both the phosphane and the bridging ligand on the performance of these catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Fluorenone&#8208;Containing Cycloparaphenylenes and Their Late&#8208;Stage Transformation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and late&#8208;stage functionalization of donor&#8211;acceptor cycloparaphenylenes by incorporating fluorenone is presented, the process yields a selection of four nanohoops that vary in ring size and acceptor strength. Their donor&#8211;acceptor characters were supported by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopic studies as well as electrochemical and computational studies, and the geometries were elucidated by X&#8208;ray crystallography.







Abstract
Cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) are the smallest possible armchair carbon nanotubes, the properties of which strongly depend on their ring size. They can be further tuned by either peripheral functionalization or by replacing phenylene rings for other aromatic units. Here we show how four novel donor&#8211;acceptor chromophores were obtained by incorporating fluorenone or 2&#8208;(9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;9&#8208;ylidene)malononitrile into the loops of two differently sized CPPs. Synthetically, we managed to perform late&#8208;stage functionalization of the fluorenone&#8208;based rings by high&#8208;yielding Knoevenagel condensations. The structures were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses, which revealed that replacing a phenylene for a fused&#8208;ring&#8208;system acceptor introduces additional strain. The donor&#8211;acceptor characters of the CPPs were supported by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopic studies, electrochemical studies (displaying the CPPs as multi&#8208;redox systems undergoing reversible or quasi&#8208;reversible redox events), as well as by computations. The oligophenylene parts were found to comprise the electron donor units of the macrocycles and the fluorenone parts the acceptor units.

They can be further tuned by either peripheral functionalization or by replacing phenylene rings for other aromatic units. Here we show how four novel donor&#8211;acceptor chromophores were obtained by incorporating fluorenone or 2-(9&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-fluoren-9-ylidene)malononitrile into the loops of two differently sized CPPs. Synthetically, we managed to perform late-stage functionalization of the fluorenone-based rings by high-yielding Knoevenagel condensations. The structures were confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analyses, which revealed that replacing a phenylene for a fused-ring-system acceptor introduces additional strain. The donor&#8211;acceptor characters of the CPPs were supported by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopic studies, electrochemical studies (displaying the CPPs as multi-redox systems undergoing reversible or quasi-reversible redox events), as well as by computations. The oligophenylene parts were found to comprise the electron donor units of the macrocycles and the fluorenone parts the acceptor units.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bromine Substitution Improves the Photothermal Performance of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Phototheranostic Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bromine substitution enhances the photothermal properties of &#960;&#8208;conjugated phototheranostic molecules; this is the outcome of a combination of the heavy&#8208;atom effect, enhanced ICT effect, and more intense bromine&#8208;mediate intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. The results demonstrate that bromine substitution is promising for developing high&#8208;performance NIR&#8208;II imaging&#8208;guided photothermal agents.







Abstract
NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging&#8211;guided photothermal therapy (PTT) has been widely investigated due to its great application potential in tumor theranostics. PTT is an effective and non&#8208;invasive tumor treatment method that can adapt to tumor hypoxia; nevertheless, simple and effective strategies are still desired to develop new materials with excellent PTT properties to meet clinical requirements. In this work, we developed a bromine&#8208;substitution strategy to enhance the PTT of A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8217;&#8208;D&#8208;A &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules. The experimental results reveal that bromine substitution can notably enhance the absorptivity (&#1013;) and photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules, resulting in the brominated molecules generating two times more heat (&#1013;808&#8197;nm&#215;PCE) than their unsubstituted counterpart. We disclose that the enhanced photothermal properties of bromine&#8208;substituted &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules are a combined outcome of the heavy&#8208;atom effect, enhanced ICT effect, and more intense bromine&#8208;mediate intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. Finally, the NIR&#8208;II tumor imaging capability and efficient PTT tumor ablation of the brominated &#960;&#8208;conjugated materials demonstrate that bromine substitution is a promising strategy for developing future high&#8208;performance NIR&#8208;II imaging&#8208;guided PTT agents.

         <title>Application of MXene&#8208;based materials for cathode in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries have a high theoretical specific capacity of 1675 mAh&#183;g&#8208;1 and become the most promising high energy storage system in the future. However, their applications are hindered by insulated feature and volume expansion of sulfur, as well as the &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221; of polysulfides. MXenes own metallic conductivity and strong ability of polysulfides adsorption. Besides, their unique two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structure, large specific surface area, abundant functional groups and adjustability are beneficial to overcome the drawbacks of sulfur cathode. In this review, different mainstream preparation methods and excellent properties of MXenes are summarized. Important achievements and recent progress of MXene&#8208;based cathodes and interlayers applied to cathodes are concluded later. Finally, there are also provided the difficulties and potential uses of MXenes for Li&#8208;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>A Strategy based on &#8220;Ambident Anthracene&#8221; for the Synthesis of Higher&#8208;Order Iptycenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient method for the synthesis of higher&#8208;order iptycenes using an "ambident anthracene" building block is presented. For that purpose, an iterative elongation strategy involving the ring&#8208;opening of an endoxide to give a highly reactive anthranoxide, followed by a Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with an aryne was used. The method systematically provides higher&#8208;order iptycenes, including trideciptycene, which is currently the iptycene with the longest chain to have been synthesized. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed interesting structures in which solvent molecules fill the cavities of these iptycenes, thus creating a &#8220;honeycomb&#8221; structure with the solvent molecules arranged in tubular spaces.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Boron&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (B&#8208;PAHs) have established a strong foothold in the realm of organic electronics. However, their catalytic potential remains largely untapped. In this study, we synthesise and characterise two bench stable B,N&#8208;doped PAH derivatives based on a 1,4&#8208;azaborinine motif. Most importantly, the anthracene derived structure is an efficient catalyst in the reduction of various carbonyls and imines. These results underscore the potential of B,N&#8208;PAHs in catalytic transformations, setting the stage for deeper exploration in this chemical space.</dc:description>

         <title>A Proof&#8208;of&#8208;Concept Study on the Theranostic Potential of 177Lu&#8208;labeled Biocompatible Covalent Polymer Nanoparticles for Cancer Targeted Radionuclide Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Theranostic nanomedicine combined bioimaging and therapy probably rises more helpful and interesting opportunities for personalized medicine. In this work, 177Lu radiolabeling and surface PEGylation of biocompatible covalent polymer nanoparticles (CPNs) have generated a new theranostic nanoformulation &#160;for targeted diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. The in vitro anticancer investigations demonstrate that 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;CPNs possess excellent bonding capacity with breast cancer cells (4T1), inhibiting the cell viability, leading to cell apoptosis, arresting the cell cycle, and upregulating the reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can be attributed to the good targeting ability of the nanocarrier and the strong relative biological effect of the radionuclide labelled compound. Single photon emission computed tomography/ computed tomography (SPECT/CT) imaging and in vivo biodistribution based on 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;CPNs reveal that notable radioactivity accumulation at tumor site in murine 4T1 models with both intravenous and intratumoral administration of the prepared radiotracer. Significant tumor inhibition has been observed in mice treated with 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;CPNs, of which the median survival was highly extended. More strikingly, 50% of mice intratumorally injected with 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;CPNs was cured and showed no tumor recurrence within 90 days. The outcome of this work can provide new hints for traditional nanomedicines and promote clinical translation of 177Lu radiolabeled compounds efficiently.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>With the increasing demand for low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;safety portable batteries, aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have been regarded as a potential alternative to the lithium&#8208;ion batteries, bringing about extensive research dedicated in the exploration of high&#8208;performance and highly reversible ZIBs. Although separators are generally considered as non&#8208;active components in conventional research on ZIBs, advanced separators designs seem to offer effective solutions to the majority of issues within ZIBs system. These issues encompass concerns related to the zinc anode, cathode, and electrolyte.&#160; Initially, we delve into the origins and implications of various inherent problems within the ZIBs system. Subsequently, we present the latest research advancements in addressing these challenges through separators engineering. This includes a comprehensive, detailed exploration of various strategies, coupled with instances of advanced characterizations to provide a more profound insight into the mechanisms that influence the separators. Finally, we undertake a multi&#8208;criteria evaluation, based on application standards for diverse substrate separators, while proposing guiding principles for the optimal design of separators in zinc batteries. This review aims to furnish valuable guidance for the future development of advanced separators, thereby nurturing progress in the field of ZIBs.</dc:description>

Finally, we undertake a multi-criteria evaluation, based on application standards for diverse substrate separators, while proposing guiding principles for the optimal design of separators in zinc batteries. This review aims to furnish valuable guidance for the future development of advanced separators, thereby nurturing progress in the field of ZIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intramolecular Carboxyamidation of Alkyne&#8208;Tethered O&#8208;Acylhydroxamates through Formation of Fe(III)&#8208;Nitrenoids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We developed intramolecular carboxyamidations of alkyne&#8208;tethered O&#8208;acylhydroxamates followed by either thermally induced spontaneous or 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)pyridine&#8208;catalyzed O&#8594;O or O&#8594;N acyl group migration. Under iron&#8208;catalyzed conditions, the carboxyamidation products were generated in high yield from both Z&#8208;alkene and arene&#8208;tethered substrates. DFT calculations indicate that the iron&#8208;catalyzed carboxyamidation proceeds via a stepwise mechanism involving iron&#8211;imidyl radical cyclization followed by intramolecular acyloxy transfer from the iron center to the alkenyl radical center to furnish the cis&#8208;carboxyamidation product. Upon treatment with 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)pyridine, the Z&#8208;alkene&#8208;tethered carboxyamidation products underwent selective O&#8594;O acyl migration to generate 2&#8208;acyloxy&#8208;5&#8208;acyl pyrroles. Thermal O&#8594;N acyl migration occurs during carboxyamidation if the Z&#8208;alkene linker contains an alkyl or an aryl substituent at the &#946;&#8208;position of the carbonyl group. On the other hand, the arene linker&#8208;containing compounds selectively undergo O&#8594;N acyl migration to generate N&#8208;acyl&#8208;3&#8208;acylisoindolinones, and the corresponding O&#8594;O acyl migration forming isoindole derivatives was not observed.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Protein Conjugation by a Multicomponent Ugi Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemical bioconjugation of proteins has seen tremendous applications in the past decades, with the booming of antibody&#8208;drug conjugates and their use in oncology. While genetic engineering has permitted to produce bespoke proteins featuring key (un&#8208;)natural amino acid residues poised for site&#8208;selective modifications, the conjugation of native proteins is riddled with selectivity issues. Chemoselective strategies are plentiful and enable the precise modification of virtually any residue with a reactive side&#8208;chain; site&#8208;selective methods are less common and usually most effective on small and medium&#8208;sized proteins. In this context, we studied the application of the Ugi multicomponent reaction for the site&#8208;selective conjugation of amine and carboxylate groups on proteins, and antibodies in particular. Through an in&#8208;depth mechanistic methodology work supported by peptide mapping studies, we managed to develop a set of conditions allowing the highly selective modification of antibodies bearing N&#8208;terminal glutamate and aspartate residues. We demonstrated that this strategy did not alter their affinity toward their target antigen and produced an antibody&#8208;drug conjugate with subnanomolar potency. Excitingly, we showed that the high site selectivity of our strategy was maintained on other protein formats, especially on anticalins, for which directed mutagenesis helped to highlight the key importance of a single lysine residue.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformations and Rearrangements of Collinolactone &#8211; Experiments and Theory on a Dynamic Cyclodecatriene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Collinolactone A is a microbial specialized metabolite with an unique 6&#8208;10&#8208;7 tricyclic bislactone skeleton which was isolated from Streptomyces bacteria. The unusual cyclodecatriene motif features dynamic interconversions of two rotamers. Given the biological profiling of collinolactone A as neuroprotective agent, semisynthetic modifications represent an invaluable strategy to enhance its efficacy. Since understanding conformations and reactions of bioactive substances is crucial for rational structure&#8208;based design and synthesis of derivatives, we conducted computational studies on conformational behavior as well as experiments on thermal and acid induced rearrangements of the cyclodecatriene. Experimental conformer ratios of collinolactone A and its biosynthetic ketolactone precursor are well reproduced by computations at the PW6B95&#8208;D3/def2&#8208;QZVPP//r2SCAN&#8208;3c level. Upon heating collinolactone A in anhydrous dioxane at 100 &#176;C, three collinolactone B stereoisomers exhibiting enollactone structures are formed via Cope rearrangements. Our computations predict the energetic preference for a boat&#8208;like transition state in agreement with the stereochemical outcome of the main reaction pathway. Constriction of the ten&#8208;membered ring forms collinolactone C with four annulated rings and an exocyclic double bond. Computations and semisynthetic experiments demonstrate strong preference for an acid&#8208;catalyzed reaction pathway over an alternative Alder&#8208;ene route to collinolactone C with a prohibitive reaction barrier, again in line with stereochemical observations.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unexpected [4+3]/[4+1] reaction of diene&#8208;vinylcyclopropanes (diene&#8208;VCPs) and carbon monoxide to access challenging 5/7/5 tricycles was developed, together with its mechanistic study by using ab initio calculations.







Abstract
Report here is a Rh&#8208;catalyzed [4+3]/[4+1] cycloaddition of diene&#8208;vinylcyclopropanes (diene&#8208;VCPs) and carbon monoxide to access compounds with angular 5/7/5 tricyclic skeleton found in natural products. The reaction has broad scope and further transformation of the [4+3]/[4+1] cycloadduct was also investigated. How this [4+3]/[4+1] reaction occurs and why its competing [4+3] reaction is disfavored have been investigated computationally.

         <title>Control of Relative Positions of Electron&#8208;Donor and Electron&#8208;Acceptor Molecules in Charge&#8208;Transfer Complexes for Luminescent Property Modulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Relative&#8208;position control of electron&#8208;donor and electron&#8208;acceptor molecules in charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complexes without changing their molecular structures has been demonstrated. Different relative positions enabled the CT complexes to exhibit different emission wavelengths and different luminescence processes derived from CT interaction in the ground state, an exciplex, and CT interaction with the electron&#8208;acceptor dimer.







Abstract
Charge&#8208;transfer complexes can exhibit various physical properties that depend on the relative positions of electron&#8208;donor and electron&#8208;acceptor molecules. Several studies have investigated the relationship between the relative positions of electron&#8208;donor and electron&#8208;acceptor molecules and their luminescence properties. However, elucidating the correlation between the relative positions and detailed luminescence processes without changing the molecular structures has not been explored. Herein, we report control of the relative position based on charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonds between sulfo and amino groups and on alkylamines&#8217; steric factors, and report concomitant modulation of the luminescent properties. Six charge&#8208;transfer complexes were prepared from anthracene&#8208;2,6&#8208;disulfonic acid and 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene as electron&#8208;donor and electron&#8208;acceptor molecules, and various alkylamines. Different alkylamines&#8242; steric factors drastically and precisely changed the relative positions of the electron&#8208;donor and electron&#8208;acceptor molecules without changing their molecular structures. Consequently, the six crystals exhibited maximum emission wavelengths from 543 to 624&#8197;nm and different luminescence processes.

Supported Ionic Liquid Phase catalysts combine advantages from homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. Control of the catalyst position in the IL film will boost their performance. Four ionic liquids are presented with NHC ligands deposited on SBA&#8208;15. Solid&#8208;state NMR and MD simulations yield a full model of the IL self&#8208;assembled monolayer.







Abstract
Separation and reuse of the catalytically active metal complexes are persistent issues in homogeneous catalysis. Supported Ionic Liquid Phase (SILP) catalysts, where the catalytic center is dissolved in a thin film of a stable ionic liquid, deposited on a solid support, present a promising alternative. However, the dissolution of the metal center in the film leaves little control over its position and its activity. We present here four novel, task&#8208;specific ionic liquids [FPhnImHR]I (n=1, 2; R=PEG2, C12H25), designed to self&#8208;assemble on a silica surface without any covalent bonding and offering a metal binding site in a controlled distance to the support. Advanced multinuclear solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopic techniques under Magic Angle Spinning, complemented by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, allow us to determine their molecular conformation when deposited inside SBA&#8208;15 as a model silica support. We provide here conceptual proof for a rational design of ionic liquids self&#8208;assembling into thin films, opening an avenue for a second, improved generation of SILP catalysts.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Gamma&#8208;Gamma Dimerization of Siloxydienes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the oxidative dimerization reaction of siloxydienes derived from simple enones that creates a new gamma&#8208;gamma (&#947;&#8208;&#947;) C&#8722;C bond using catalytic iron and benzoyl peroxide as the terminal oxidant in acetonitrile solvent at ambient temperature. The reaction shows a broad substrate scope including cyclic and acyclic siloxydienes derived from ketones, aldehydes, and esters, which are converted to 1,8&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds under mild catalytic reaction conditions in 19&#8211;89&#8201;% yield across 30 examples. The method is suitable for the coupling of sterically demanding carbon centers, including the formation of vicinal quaternary centers. Conceptually, the dienol ether serves as a precursor to a conjugated radical cation, which undergoes highly site selective &#947;&#8208;dimerization reactions. The &#947;&#8208;&#947; dimerization strategy is applied to the synthesis of a bioactive analogue of honokiol.

         <title>Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Synthesis of Isomeric I&#8208;branched Polylactosamines Using Traceless Blocking Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemo&#8208;enzymatic strategy for the regioselective I&#8208;branching of polylactosamines is described. Enzyme promiscuity is exploited to generate oligosaccharides functionalized with traceless blocking groups. Multiple oligosaccharides are synthesized to demonstrate that the blocking group selectively directs enzymatic I&#8208;branch regioselectivity. This methodology allows the synthesis of polylactosamines of various topologies.







Abstract
Poly&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl lactosamines (polyLacNAc) are common structural motifs of N&#8208; and O&#8208;linked glycan, glycosphingolipids and human milk oligosaccharides. They can be branched by the addition of &#946;1,6&#8208;linked N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;glucosamine (GlcNAc) moieties to internal galactoside (Gal) residues by the I&#8208;branching enzyme beta&#8208;1,6&#8208;N&#8208;acetylglucosaminyltransferase 2 (GCNT2). I&#8208;branching has been implicated in many biological processes and is also associated with various diseases such as cancer progression. Currently, there is a lack of methods that can install, in a regioselective manner, I&#8208;branches and allows the preparation of isomeric poly&#8208;LacNAc derivatives. Here, we described a chemo&#8208;enzymatic strategy that addresses this deficiency and is based on the enzymatic assembly of an oligo&#8208;LacNAc chain that at specific positions is modified by a GlcNTFA moiety. Replacement of the trifluoroacetyl (TFA) moiety by tert&#8208;butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) gives compounds in which the galactoside at the proximal site is blocked from modification by GCNT2. After elaboration of the antennae, the Boc group can be removed, and the resulting amine acetylated to give natural I&#8208;branched structures. It is also shown that fucosides can function as a traceless blocking group that can provide complementary I&#8208;branched structures from a single precursor. The methodology made it possible to synthesize a library of polyLacNAc chains having various topologies.

         <title>Unexpected Reduction of a Coordinated Diazapyridinophane Ligand Bound to Chromium(III) Ion Leading to Delocalization of the Unpaired Electron across Two Isolated Pyridine Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridine moieties, which are electronically isolated from each other by saturated atom chains, can be potentially redox&#8208;active in complexes. Thus, structural and spectroscopic methods in combination with theoretical calculations provide unequivocal evidence that the coordinated tetraazamacrocyclic ligand L&#8208;N4Me2 in the stable neutral bis(acetato)chromium complex indeed contains anionic pyridine radical units coordinated to a chromium(III) ion.







Abstract
In the tetraazamacrocyclic ligand N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,11&#8208;diaza&#8208;[3.3](2,6)pyridinophane (L&#8208;N4Me2), the two pyridine units are separated from each other by sp3&#8208;hybridized triatomic bridges. Such electronically isolated pyridine moieties are considerably less prone to reductions than di&#8208; or triimines. A detailed structural, magnetic, and spectroscopic investigation of the complexes [Cr(L&#8208;N4Me2)(OAc)2] and [Cr(L&#8208;N4Me2)(OAc)2](PF6), in combination with theoretical calculations, reveals that the reduced complex must be described as a chromium(III) ion coordinated to the anionic radical ligand (L&#8208;N4Me2)&#8901;&#8722; rather than a low&#8208;spin chromium(II) ion bound to closed&#8208;shell ligands. Thus, it is, to the best of our knowledge, only the second example of a stable and structurally characterized metal complex containing a reduced isolated pyridine unit. The stability is attributed to the delocalization of the unpaired electron across the two pyridine units, mediated by their interaction to the metal ion.

         <title>Electronic Effects in Phosphino&#8208;Iminophosphorane PdII Complexes upon Varying the N Substituent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The consequences of varying the substituent of the N atom in bidentate (P,PN) ligand was studied experimentally and theoretically within 3 series of palladium(II) complexes featuring also chlorides and/or isocyanides. The alkyl substituted complexes exhibit the higher stability while the H and trimethylsilyl containing counterparts were the most sensitive. For the latter, charge differences within the complexes were shown.







Abstract
Three series of palladium(II) complexes supported by a phosphine&#8208;iminophosphorane ligand built upon an ortho&#8208;phenylene core were investigated to study the influence of the iminophosphorane N substituent. Cis&#8208;dichloride palladium(II) complexes&#8197;1 in which the N atom bears an isopropyl (iPr, 1&#8201;a), a phenyl (Ph, 1&#8201;b), a trimethylsilyl (TMS, 1&#8201;c) group or an H atom (1&#8201;d) were synthesized in high yield. They were characterized by NMR, IR spectroscopy, HR&#8208;mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, and X&#8208;ray diffraction. A substantial bond length difference between the Pd&#8722;Cl bonds was observed in 1. Complexes 1&#8201;a&#8211;d were converted into [Pd(LR)Cl(CNtBu)](OTf)] 2&#8201;a&#8211;d whose isocyanide is located trans to the iminophosphorane. The corresponding dicationic complexes [Pd(LR)(CNtBu)2](OTf)2 3&#8201;a&#8211;d were also synthesized, however they exhibited lower stability in solution than 2, the isopropyl derivative 3&#8201;a being the most stable of the series. Molecular modeling was performed to rationalize the regioselectivity of the substitution of the single chloride by isocyanide (from 1 to 2) and to study the electronic distribution in the complexes. In particular differences between the TMS and H containing complexes vs. the iPr and Ph ones were found. This suggests that the nature of the N substituent is far from innocent and can help tune the reactivity of iminophosphorane complexes.

The alkyl substituted complexes exhibit the higher stability while the H and trimethylsilyl containing counterparts were the most sensitive. For the latter, charge differences within the complexes were shown.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three series of palladium(II) complexes supported by a phosphine-iminophosphorane ligand built upon an ortho-phenylene core were investigated to study the influence of the iminophosphorane N substituent. &lt;i&gt;Cis&lt;/i&gt;-dichloride palladium(II) complexes&#8197;&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; in which the N atom bears an isopropyl (iPr, &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;), a phenyl (Ph, &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;), a trimethylsilyl (TMS, &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;c&lt;/b&gt;) group or an H atom (&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;d&lt;/b&gt;) were synthesized in high yield. They were characterized by NMR, IR spectroscopy, HR-mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, and X-ray diffraction. A substantial bond length difference between the Pd&#8722;Cl bonds was observed in &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;. Complexes &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;d&lt;/b&gt; were converted into [Pd(L&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;)Cl(CN&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Bu)](OTf)] &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;d&lt;/b&gt; whose isocyanide is located &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; to the iminophosphorane. The corresponding dicationic complexes [Pd(L&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;)(CN&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Bu)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;](OTf)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;3&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;d&lt;/b&gt; were also synthesized, however they exhibited lower stability in solution than &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, the isopropyl derivative &lt;b&gt;3&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; being the most stable of the series. Molecular modeling was performed to rationalize the regioselectivity of the substitution of the single chloride by isocyanide (from &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; to &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) and to study the electronic distribution in the complexes. In particular differences between the TMS and H containing complexes vs. the iPr and Ph ones were found. This suggests that the nature of the N substituent is far from innocent and can help tune the reactivity of iminophosphorane complexes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tunable Metal&#8208;Free Imidazole&#8208;Benzimidazole Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Reduction in Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selectivity of electrocatalytic oxygen reduction in aqueous media is tuned by varying pH; redox&#8208;active metal&#8208;free imidazole&#8208;benzimidazole (ImBenz) catalyst with a NO2 substituent at pH&#8197;7 favors H2O production, and ImBenz without substituent at pH&#8197;13 favors H2O2 production.







Abstract
A series of metal&#8208;free imidazole&#8208;benzimidazole catalysts (ImBenz&#8208;H, ImBenz&#8208;NO2, ImBenz&#8208;OCH3) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) were prepared. We demonstrate that the electrocatalytic O2 reduction by ImBenz&#8208;NO2 with the electron&#8208;withdrawing group showed high selectivity toward H2O with the number of electrons transferred (n=3.7) in a neutral aqueous solution. The highest ORR selectivity toward H2O2 was achieved using ImBenz&#8208;H (n=2.4) in an alkaline solution. Electrochemical studies of reaction kinetics disclosed that the highest turnover frequencies were obtained from ImBenz&#8208;H in both neutral and alkaline aqueous solutions. The results prove that the ORR selectivity is tunable by modulating the substituent of the ImBenz catalysts. Furthermore, DFT calculations suggested that the ORR mechanism of ImBenz&#8208;H involves the electron transfer from imidazole&#8208;benzimidazole to O2 resulting in the formation of H2O2 which supports the redox active properties of the catalysts ImBenz.

         <title>NDI based C2&#8208;symmetric Chiral Supramolecular Hydrogels Towards Enhanced Conductivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The goal of the development of C2&#8208;symmetrical conductive supramolecular hydrogels was to attain uniformity and structural stability. The co&#8208;assembly with bipyridine functional group isomers line up within the gel&#8216;s framework and make channels for electron transmission, and improves their conductivity. By combining the advantages of the two design approaches, this synergistic method produces hydrogels with improved mechanical and conductive properties for possible use in a variety of bio&#8208;electronic devices in personalized healthcare and other bio&#8208;engineering areas.







Abstract
To comprehend the significance of improved conductive properties in C2&#8208;symmetric hydrogels, it is vital to investigate how non&#8208;gelating achiral functional group isomers influence the conductivity of such supramolecular hydrogels, whereas understanding the major driving forces behind this regulatory process is first and foremost. Herein, we report a hydrogel system containing tryptophan&#8208;conjugated NDI as the backbone (L/D&#8208;NTrp), enabling effective supramolecular assembly with the bipyridyl functional group isomers. This co&#8208;assembly behavior results in materials with exceptional mechanical properties and high conductivities, surpassing most previously reported C2&#8208;symmetrical hydrogels, as well as the ability to form controlled morphologies. Notably, the co&#8208;hydrogels displayed an eight&#8208;fold increase in mechanical strength, making them more robust and resistant to deformation compared to the original gel. Additionally, all hydrogels exhibited favorable electrical conductivity, with the co&#8208;assembled hydrogels showcasing notable performance, making them a promising candidate for use in electronic devices and sensors. This report lays the foundation for further investigation into the properties and potential applications of L/D&#8208;NTrp compound in the range of fields, including drug delivery, tissue engineering, and electronics.

Extended tetrathiafulvalenes (TTFs) with fluoreno[3,2&#8208;b]fluorene and diindeno[1,2&#8208;b:1&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;i]anthracene cores were prepared and their redox and optical properties studied in comparison to the known extended TTF with an indeno[1,2&#8208;b]fluorene core. The dications of these compounds were found to be singlet states that may correspond to closed shell quinoid structures or open shell singlet diradical structures &#8208; for the diindeno[1,2&#8208;b:1&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;i]anthracene core, these structures are isoenergetic. The various charge states were differentiated by unique UV/Vis/NIR absorptions.







Abstract
In one&#8208;dimensional polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) containing five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered rings fused together, one key question is whether the structures possess a quinoidal or aromatic diradical character. Here, we generate such PAHs by reversible oxidation of PAH&#8208;extended tetrathiafulvalenes (TTFs). Extended TTFs were thus prepared and studied for their geometrical properties (crystallography), redox properties, and UV/Vis/NIR/EPR characteristics as a function of charge state. The EPR measurements of radical cations showed unique features for each PAH&#8208;TTF. The dications, formally composed of fluoreno[3,2&#8208;b]fluorene and diindeno[1,2&#8208;b:1&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;i]anthracene cores, were experimentally found to exhibit singlet ground states. For the latter, calculations reveal the closed shell, quinoid singlet state to be isoenergetic with the open shell singlet diradical. Each charge state exhibited unique optical properties with radical cations absorbing strongly in the NIR region with signatures from &#960;&#8208;dimers for the large core. The experimental results were paralleled and supported by detailed computations, including spin density distribution calculations, EPR simulations, and nucleus independent chemical shift (NICS) xy scans.

         <title>Silicon Chalcogenide Cage Compounds: New Structures Derived from the Bicyclic Silicon(I) Ring Compound Si4{N(SiMe3)Mes}4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New silicon chalcogenide cage compounds with amino substituents have been derived from reactions of the bicyclic silicon(I) ring compound Si4{N(SiMe3)Mes}4 with the chalcogen transfer agents Me3NO and propylenesulfide and with the chalcogens red selenium and tellurium in one step. This resulted into the first T4 silsesquioxane, defect&#8208;heterocubane&#8208;type clusters with three Si&#8722;Si bonds and a ditelluro&#8722;tetrasila&#8722;tricyclohexane.







Abstract
The bicyclic silicon(I) ring compound Si4{N(SiMe3)Mes}4 (2) was used as starting material in reactions with chalcogens and chalcogen transfer agents at low temperatures. This resulted in the selective formation of new cage compounds. With Me3NO, a silicon oxide with adamantane&#8208;type cage 3 was isolated that represents the first isolated T4 silsesquioxane. Reactions with propylenesulfide and red selenium gave direct access to defect heterocubane&#8208;type cages 4 and 5 with three Si&#8722;Si bonds wherein the silicon atoms adopt different low oxidation states of +I and +III. A reaction with elemental tellurium even occurs below room temperature to provide ditelluro&#8722;tetrasila&#8722;tricyclohexane 6.

&lt;p&gt;The bicyclic silicon(I) ring compound Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;{N(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)Mes}&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) was used as starting material in reactions with chalcogens and chalcogen transfer agents at low temperatures. This resulted in the selective formation of new cage compounds. With Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NO, a silicon oxide with adamantane-type cage &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; was isolated that represents the first isolated T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; silsesquioxane. Reactions with propylenesulfide and red selenium gave direct access to defect heterocubane-type cages &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; with three Si&#8722;Si bonds wherein the silicon atoms adopt different low oxidation states of +I and +III. A reaction with elemental tellurium even occurs below room temperature to provide ditelluro&#8722;tetrasila&#8722;tricyclohexane &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Classical Gold Carbonyl Complexes in Tetrahedral and Trigonal&#8208;Planar Settings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridyl&#8208;borate scorpionates decorated with anionic and fluoro&#8208;alkyl groups serve as ideal ligands to capture gold(I)&#8208;carbon monoxide fragments in trigonal planar and tetrahedral environments that display remarkably low C&#8722;O stretching frequencies, and have significant Au&#8722;CO &#960;&#8208;bond character.







Abstract
A unique four&#8208;coordinate, classical gold(I)&#8208;carbonyl complex with substantial backdonation from gold has been isolated by using a B&#8208;methylated and fluorinated tris(pyridyl)borate chelator. Its lighter silver(I) and copper(I) analogs enabled a study of trends in the coinage&#8208;metal family. The B&#8208;arylated ligand version also afforded a gold&#8211;carbon monoxide complex that displays a notably low C&#8722;O stretch value, but with trigonal planar geometry at the gold. A computational analysis shows that the AuI&#8722;CO bonds of these tris(pyridyl)borate ligand&#8208;supported molecules consist of electrostatic attraction, OC&#8594;Au &#963;&#8208;donation, and very significant Au&#8594;CO &#960;&#8208;back&#8208;bonding components. The latter is responsible for the observed C&#8722;O stretching frequencies, which are lower than in free CO.

         <title>A Proof&#8208;of&#8208;Principle Design for Through&#8208;Space Transmission of Unidirectional Rotary Motion by Molecular Photogears
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stereochemical approach to transmitting the directional double&#8208;bond rotary motion of light&#8208;driven molecular motors through space onto a remote single&#8208;bond axis is put forth and successfully tested by means of quantum&#8208;chemical modeling. A key result in the assessment of the approach is that the desired photogearing process is favorable compared to the undesired, free&#8208;standing single&#8208;bond rotation process (&#8220;slippage&#8221;) with which it competes.







Abstract
The construction of molecular photogears that can achieve through&#8208;space transmission of the unidirectional double&#8208;bond rotary motion of light&#8208;driven molecular motors onto a remote single&#8208;bond axis is a formidable challenge in the field of artificial molecular machines. Here, we present a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle design of such photogears that is based on the possibility of using stereogenic substituents to control both the relative stabilities of two helical forms of the photogear and the double&#8208;bond photoisomerization reaction that connects them. The potential of the design was verified by quantum&#8208;chemical modeling through which photogearing was found to be a favorable process compared to free&#8208;standing single&#8208;bond rotation (&#8220;slippage&#8221;). Overall, our study unveils a surprisingly simple approach to realizing unidirectional photogearing.

         <title>Synthesis of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Chiral Aza/Boracyclophanes with a meta and para Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthesis of &#960;&#8208;conjugated chiral aza/boracyclophanes that show unique dependence of the racemization energy barriers on macrocyclic conformations with distinct substitution patterns, and the ring constraints also impact as compared with the open&#8208;chain structures.







Abstract
We herein describe the synthesis of a new class of axially chiral aza/boracyclophanes (BDN1, BXN1, BDB1 and BXB1) using binaphthyls as chiral building blocks and the main&#8208;group (B/N) chemistry with tunable electronic effects. All macrocycles substituted with triarylamine donors or triarylborane acceptors are strongly luminescent. These macrocycles showed two distinct meta and para &#960;&#8208;conjugation pathways, leading to the formation of quasi figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight and square&#8208;shaped conformations. Interestingly, comparison of such structural models revealed that the former type of macrocycles BXN1 and BXB1 gave higher racemization barriers relative to the other ones. The results reported here may provide a new approach to engineer the optical stability of &#960;&#8208;conjugated chiral macrocycles by controlling &#960;&#8208;substitution patterns. The ring constraints induced by macrocyclization were also demonstrated to contribute to the configurational persistence as compared with the open&#8208;chain analogues p&#8208;BTT and m&#8208;BTT.

Etherification in computational chemistry: Mechanistic studies are of paramount importance for the development of catalytic systems. Our study elucidates the CuII&#8208;complex&#8208;catalyzed etherification of alcohol substrates under the purview of Chan&#8208;Lam&#8208;based coupling reactions. DFT calculations characterized the presence of methoxy&#8208;bridged CuII intermediates as the resting state and the transmetalation step as rate&#8208;limiting. The effect of substrate variation was exemplified by using energy span values. More information can be found in the Research Article by D. Koley and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302983).

         <title>Rational Design and Biological Application of Hybrid Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorophores are considered powerful tools for not only enabling the visualization of cell structures, substructures, and biological processes, but also making for the quantitative and qualitative measurement of various analytes in living systems. However, most fluorophores do not meet the diverse requirements for biological applications in terms of their photophysical and biological properties. Hybridization is an important strategy in molecular engineering that provides fluorophores with complementarity and multifunctionality. This review summarizes the basic strategies of hybridization with four classes of fluorophores, including xanthene, cyanine, coumarin, and BODIPY with a focus on their structure&#8208;property relationship (SPR) and biological applications. This review aims to provide rational hybrid ideas for expanding the reservoir of knowledge regarding fluorophores and promoting the development of newly produced fluorophores for applications in the field of life sciences.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA&#8208;Targeted Complexes of Tc and Re for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to their favorable chemical features, Re and Tc complexes have been widely used for the development of new therapeutic agents and imaging probes to solve problems of biomedical relevance. This review provides an update of the most relevant research efforts towards the development of novel cancer theranostic agents using Re and Tc&#8208;based compounds interacting with specific DNA structures. This includes a variety of homometallic complexes, namely those containing M(CO)3 (M = Re, Tc) moieties, that exhibit different modes of interaction with DNA, such as covalent binding, intercalation, groove binding or G&#8208;quadruplex DNA binding. Additionally, heterometallic complexes, designed to potentiate synergistic effects of different metal centers to improve DNA&#8208;targeting, cytotoxicity and fluorescence properties, are also reviewed. Particular attention is also given to 99mTc&#8208; and 188Re&#8208;labeled oligonucleotides that have been widely explored to develop imaging and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals through the in vivo hybridization with a specific complementary DNA or RNA target sequence to provide useful molecular tools in precision medicine for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Finally, the need for further improvement of DNA&#8208;targeted Re and Tc&#8208;based compounds as potential therapeutic and diagnostic agents is highlighted, and future directions are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Tripodal Triazine and 1,8&#8208;Naphthalimide based Small Molecules as Efficient Photocatalysts for Visible&#8208;light Oxidative Condensation</title>

         <dc:description>Tripodal donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) small molecules&#160;Tr&#8208;Np3&#160;and&#160;Tr&#8208;T&#8208;Np3&#160;consisting of triazine and 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide, without and with a thiophene spacer have been synthesized. Their optical and redox properties were thoroughly investigated along with their utilization as photocatalysts in organic transformations. Compounds&#160;Tr&#8208;Np3&#160;and&#160;Tr&#8208;T&#8208;Np3&#160;showed broad absorption in the range of 290&#8208;480 nm in solutions and 300&#8208;510 nm in thin films. These tripodal molecules displayed wide optical bandgaps of (Egopt) 3.10 eV and 2.64 eV with very deep&#8208;lying HOMO energy levels (&#8722;6.60 eV and &#8211;6.03 eV) and low&#8208;lying LUMO levels (&#8722;3.50 eV and &#8722;3.40 eV). Appreciable electron mobilities of 5.24 &#215; 10&#8208;4&#160;cm2/Vs&#160;and 6.14 &#215; 10&#8208;4&#160;cm2/Vs were obtained for compounds&#160;Tr&#8208;Np3&#160;and&#160;Tr&#8208;T&#8208;Np3&#160;respectively by space&#8208;charge limited current (SCLC) measurements. Metal&#8208;free tripodal molecules&#160;Tr&#8208;Np3&#160;and&#160;Tr&#8208;T&#8208;Np3&#160;showed excellent photocatalytic abilities towards condensation of aromatic aldehydes and&#160;o&#8208;phenylenediamine followed by cyclization under visible light to yield benzimidazole derivatives that are of high medicinal value.</dc:description>

         <title>Aromaticity in the Electronic Ground and Lowest Triplet States of Molecules with Fused Thiophene Rings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Analysis of the variations of the off&#8208;nucleus isotropic magnetic shielding, &#963;iso(r), around thiophene, thienothiophenes, dithienothiophenes&#160;and sulflowers in their electronic ground (S0) and lowest triplet (T1) states reveals that some of the features of aromaticity and bonding in these molecules do not fit in with predictions based on the popular H&#252;ckel&#8217;s and Baird&#8217;s rules. Despite having 4n &#960; electrons, the S0 states of the sulflowers are shown to be aromatic, due to the local aromaticities of the thiophene rings. To reduce T1 antiaromaticity, the geometry of thiophene changes between S0 and T1: In addition to losing planarity, the carbon&#8208;carbon two &#8216;double&#8217; and one &#8216;single&#8217; bonds in S0 turn into two &#8216;single&#8217; and one &#8216;double&#8217; bonds in T1. Well&#8208;defined Baird&#8208;style aromaticity reversals are observed between the S0 and T1 states of only three of the twelve thiophene&#8208;based compounds investigated in this work; in contrast, the sulflower with six thiophene rings which is weakly aromatic in S0 becomes more aromatic in T1. The results suggest that the change in aromaticity between the S0 and T1 states in chains of fused rings is likely to affect mostly the central ring(s); rings sufficiently far away from the central ring(s) can retain aromatic character.</dc:description>

Efficient hydrogenations of terminal alkenes with molecular hydrogen catalyzed by well&#8208;defined bench stable Mn(I) complexes containing an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;based PCP pincer ligand are described.







Abstract
Efficient hydrogenations of terminal alkenes with molecular hydrogen catalyzed by well&#8208;defined bench stable Mn(I) complexes containing an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;based PCP pincer ligand are described. These reactions are environmentally benign and atom economic, implementing an inexpensive, earth abundant non&#8208;precious metal catalyst. A range of aromatic and aliphatic alkenes were efficiently converted into alkanes in good to excellent yields. The hydrogenation proceeds at 100&#8201;&#176;C with catalyst loadings of 0.25&#8211;0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;%, 2.5&#8211;5&#8197;mol&#8201;% base (KOtBu) and a hydrogen pressure of 20&#8197;bar. Mechanistic insight into the catalytic reaction is provided by means of DFT calculations.

         <title>Discotic Star Mesogen with Thymine Nucleobases Exhibiting a Rare Gyroid Cubic Mesophase with 3D Conductivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flipping disc networks: A discotic star shaped mesogen decorated with three DNA bases thymine reversibly switches between a columnar and an extraordinary bicontinuous cubic network. The double nanosegregated bicontinuous structure is stabilized by self&#8208;association of hydrogen bonding thymines and realize a 3D charge transport. A phase flipping is also discerned by the addition of adenine as complementary base.







Abstract
A unique gyroid cubic phase has been discovered for a discotic star mesogen with three covalently attached DNA bases. In this cubic 
 phase, the conjugated core of the mesogens and the thymine pseudo guests self&#8208;assemble in mirror image continuous networks, representing a semiconducting material with three&#8208;dimensional transport pathways. The hole carrier mobilities are found to be in the typical range of poly(phenylenevinylene) scaffolds. This structure is stabilized by a weak hydrogen bonding between the thymine bases and can be switched to a columnar liquid crystal &#8211; thermally and by the addition of complementary adenine guests.

         <title>Polymorphism&#8208;driven Distinct Nanomechanical, Optical, Photophysical, and Conducting Properties in a Benzothiophene&#8208;quinoline</title>

         <dc:description>Polymorphic forms of organic conjugated small molecules, with their unique molecular shapes, packing arrangements, and interaction patterns, provide an excellent opportunity to uncover how their microstructures influence their observable properties.

The crystal forms differ in their molecular arrangements&#8213;BZB has a slip&#8208;stacked column&#8208;like structure in contrast to a zig&#8208;zag crystal packing with limited &#960;&#8211;overlap in BZN. The BZB crystals characterized by extended &#960;&#8208;stacking along [100] demonstrated semiconductor behavior, whereas the BZN, with its zig&#8208;zag crystal packing and limited stacking characteristics, was reckoned as an insulator. The crystal forms also differ in their nanomechanical properties. This discrepancy in mechanical behavior can be attributed to the distinct molecular arrangements adopted by each crystal form, resulting in unique mechanisms to relieve the strain generated during nanoindentation experiments. Waveguiding experiments on the acicular crystals of BZN revealed the passive waveguiding properties.

         <title>Exploring the Role of Metal in the Biointeraction of Metallacarboranes with C. elegans Embryos</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have transitioned from performing chemical scale studies involving the interaction of metallabis(dicarbollides) with biomolecules in a round&#8208;bottom flask, to now conducting in&#8197;vivo experiments using C. elegans. Results suggest metal (Fe or Co) plays a crucial role in C. elegans at the L4 stage and in embryos, and shows a stronger interaction with ferra compared to cobaltabis(dicarbollides).







Abstract
Cobaltabis(dicarbollides), ferrabis(dicarbollide), and their halogenated derivatives are the most studied metallacarboranes with great medical potential. These versatile compounds and their iodinated derivatives can be used in chemotherapy, radiotherapy, particle therapy, and bioimaging when isotopes are used. These metallacarboranes have been evaluated in&#8197;vitro and recently in&#8197;vivo with complex animal models. Lately, these studies have been complemented using the invertebrate Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), a nematode largely used in toxicology. When evaluated at the L4 stage, cobaltabis(dicarbollides), ([o&#8208;COSAN]&#8722; and [8,8&#8217;&#8208;I2&#8208;o&#8208;COSAN]&#8722;), exhibited a higher mean lethal dose (LD50) than ferrabis(dicarbollides) ([o&#8208;FESAN]&#8722; and [8,8&#8217;&#8208;I2&#8208;o&#8208;FESAN]&#8722;). In this work, we used the C. elegans embryos since they are a complex biological barrier with concentric layers of polysaccharides and proteins that protect them from the environment. We assessed if the metal atom changes their biointeraction with the C. elegans embryos. First, we assessed the effects on embryo development for metallacarboranes and their di&#8208;iodinated derivatives. We observed changes in color and in their surface structure. An exhaustive physicochemical characterization was performed to understand better this interaction, revealing a stronger interaction of ferrabis(dicarbollide) compounds with C. elegans embryos than the cobaltabis(dicarbollide) molecules. Unveiling the biological interaction of these compounds is of great interest for their future biomedical applications.

         <title>Molecular Adhesion of a Pilus&#8208;Derived Peptide Involved in Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilm Formation on Non&#8208;Polar ZnO&#8208;Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PAK(128&#8211;144)&#8208;peptide adsorption revealed high affinity towards etched single&#8208;crystalline ZnO(11
0) surfaces with adhesion forces ranging up to 600&#8197;pN, measured by Single&#8208;Molecule Force Spectroscopy (SMFS). With the application of the Bell&#8208;Evans theory and complementary peptide adsorption studies, we decipher possible adhesion mechanisms to originate from coordination&#8208; and hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
Bacterial colonization and biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces are initiated by the adhesion of peptides and proteins. Understanding the adhesion of such peptides and proteins at a molecular level thus represents an important step toward controlling and suppressing biofilm formation on technological and medical materials. This study investigates the molecular adhesion of a pilus&#8208;derived peptide that facilitates biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a multidrug&#8208;resistant opportunistic pathogen frequently encountered in healthcare settings. Single&#8208;molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) was performed on chemically etched ZnO
 surfaces to gather insights about peptide adsorption force and its kinetics. Metal&#8208;free click chemistry for the fabrication of peptide&#8208;terminated SMFS cantilevers was performed on amine&#8208;terminated gold cantilevers and verified by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and polarization&#8208;modulated infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (PM&#8208;IRRAS). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and XPS analyses reveal stable topographies and surface chemistries of the substrates that are not affected by SMFS. Rupture events described by the worm&#8208;like chain model (WLC) up to 600&#8197;pN were detected for the non&#8208;polar ZnO surfaces. The dissociation barrier energy at zero force &#916;G(0), the transition state distance xb and bound&#8208;unbound dissociation rate at zero force koff(0) for the single crystalline substrate indicate that coordination and hydrogen bonds dominate the peptide/surface interaction.

         <title>Quo Vadis CO2 Activation: Catalytic Reduction of CO2 to Methanol Using Aluminum and Gallium/Carbon&#8208;based Ambiphiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stoichiometric vs. Catalytic: The herein reported aluminum and gallium/carbon&#8208;based ambiphiles, a new class of hidden frustrated Lewis pairs consisting of a phosphorus ylide featuring an aluminum or gallium fragment in the ortho position of a phenyl ring scaffold, react stoichiometrically with CO2 forming the stable adducts but also act as an efficient catalyst for the reduction of CO2 mediated by HBpin.







Abstract
We report on so&#8208;called &#8220;hidden FLPs&#8221; (FLP: frustrated Lewis pair) consisting of a phosphorus ylide featuring a group 13 fragment in the ortho position of a phenyl ring scaffold to form five&#8208;membered ring structures. Although the formation of the Lewis acid/base adducts was observed in the solid state, most of the title compounds readily react with carbon dioxide to provide stable insertion products. Strikingly, 0.3&#8211;3.0&#8197;mol% of the reported aluminum and gallium/carbon&#8208;based ambiphiles catalyze the reduction of CO2 to methanol with satisfactory high selectivity and yields using pinacol borane as stoichiometric reduction equivalent. Comprehensive computational studies provided valuable mechanistic insights and shed more light on activity differences.

         <title>Benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond Oxidation with Ketone Selectivity by a Cobalt(IV)&#8208;Oxo Embedded in a &#946;&#8208;Barrel Protein</title>

Artificial metalloenzymes based on a cobalt cofactor show higher activity than the free cobalt complex for the oxidation of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in aqueous medium. The cobalt cofactor is presumably stabilized by the hydrophobic cleft provided by the protein NB4.







Abstract
Artificial metalloenzymes have emerged as biohybrid catalysts that allow to combine the reactivity of a metal catalyst with the flexibility of protein scaffolds. This work reports the artificial metalloenzymes based on the &#946;&#8208;barrel protein nitrobindin NB4, in which a cofactor [CoIIX(Me3TACD&#8208;Mal)]+X&#8722; (X=Cl, Br; Me3TACD=N,N',N''&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane, Mal=CH2CH2CH2NC4H2O2) was covalently anchored via a Michael addition reaction. These biohybrid catalysts showed higher efficiency than the free cobalt complexes for the oxidation of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in aqueous media. Using commercially available oxone (2KHSO5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;KHSO4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;K2SO4) as oxidant, a total turnover number of up to 220 and 97&#8201;% ketone selectivity were achieved for tetralin. As catalytically active intermediate, a mononuclear terminal cobalt(IV)&#8208;oxo species [Co(IV)=O]2+ was generated by reacting the cobalt(II) cofactor with oxone in aqueous solution and characterized by ESI&#8208;TOF MS.

         <title>Preparation of Carbazoles Involving 6&#960;&#8208;Electrocyclization, Photoredox&#8208;, Electrochemical&#8208;, and Thermal Cyclization Reactions: Mechanistic Insights</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic methods for the preparation of the carbazole moiety are reviewed. These methods describe the formation of new C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bonds under mild conditions enabling broad substrate diversity and functional group tolerance. Photochemical, thermal and electrochemical transformations are described as interesting preparative methodologies.







Abstract
Carbazole is a heterocyclic motif that can be found in a diverse array of natural and unnatural products displaying a wide range of biological and physiological properties. Furthermore, this heterocycle is part of electronic materials like photoconducting polymers and organic optoelectronic materials owing to its excellent photophysical characteristics. Consequently, the development of synthetic strategies for carbazole scaffolds holds potential significance in biological and material fields. In this regard, a variety of preparation methods has been developed to exploit their efficient and distinct formation of new C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bonds under mild conditions and enabling broad substrate diversity and functional group tolerance. Therefore, this review focuses on the synthesis of a set of carbazole derivatives describing a variety of methodologies that involve direct irradiation, photosensitization, photoredox, electrochemical and thermal cyclization reactions.

         <title>A Green Environmental Protection Photocatalytic Molecular Reactor for Aerobic Oxidation of Sulfide to Sulfoxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Green and environmental protection has been of particular concern in modern chemistry research. In this work, we report a visible&#8208;light photocatalytic molecular reactor based on a novel zirconium metal&#8208;organic framework (Zr&#8208;MOF) for the aerobic oxidation of sulfide to sulfoxide in water. The Zr&#8208;MOF is constructed from perylenediimides&#8208;based (PDI) carboxylate ligand and [Zr6O8(H2O)8]8+ clusters, and features a 3D (4,8)&#8208;connected csq topological structure with triangular channels of ~5 &#197; and mesoporous hexagonal channels of ~26 &#197; along c&#8208;axis. Interestingly, this Zr&#8208;MOF exhibits visible&#8208;light absorption and efficient photoinduced free radical generation property, making it a promising photocatalytic molecular reactor in water. When it is used as a photocatalyst for the aerobic oxidation of sulfides under irradiation of visible light in water, the Zr&#8208;MOF could afford the corresponding sulfoxides with high yield, selectivity and superior recyclability. Furthermore, the mechanism studies revealed that the singlet oxygen (1O2) and superoxide radical (O2&#183;&#8208;) are the main active species for the catalytic reactions. This work offers a perceptive comprehension of the mechanism in PDI&#8208;based MOFs for further study on photocatalytic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Configuration on a Chiral&#8208;at&#8208;rhodium Catalyst Featuring a Flexible Tetradentate Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unique dynamic configuration&#160;of an enantioselective chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal catalyst based on Rh(III) and a non&#8208;chiral tetradentate ligand is described and resolved. At room temperature, the catalyst undergoes a dynamic configuration process leading to the formation of two interconvertible metal&#8208;stereoisomers, remarkably without racemization. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that this metal&#8208;isomerization proceeds via a concerted transition state, which features a trigonal bipyramidal geometry stabilized by the tetradentate ligand. Furthermore, the resolved enantiopure complex shows high catalytic enantioinduction in the Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction, achieving enantiomeric ratios as high as 99:1.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A widely utilised class of ligands in synthesis and catalysis, &#946;&#8208;diketiminate (BDI) or NacNac compounds were initially considered innocent in the sense that they remained intact in all their applications. That changed when the &#947;&#8208;C&#8208;H unit of their NCCCN backbone was found to engage in reactions with electrophiles. Here, we show that this special reactivity can be used advantageously to prepare tripodal modifications of the common NacNac ligand derived from 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;methyldiketimine [NacNacH (Me, Dipp)]. Lithiation to give NacNacLi, followed by reactions with isocyanates, isothiocyanates and a carbodiimide, have afforded a series of tripodal NacNac variants having N,N,N,O; N,N,N,S; or N,N,N,N potential dentation sites, many of which have been crystallographically characterised. Distinct ligating modes of these new ligands have been elucidated through the crystal structures of their lithiated derivatives.</dc:description>

Here, we elucidate the morphology, stability and dynamicity of supramolecular polymers derived from bisurea&#8208;based monomers. An accessible synthetic approach from 2,4&#8208;toluene diisocyanate (TDI) as the starting material is developed. TDI has two isocyanates that differ in intrinsic reactivity, which allows to obtain functional, desymmetrized monomers in a one&#8208;step procedure. We explore how the hydrophobic/hydrophilic ratio affects the properties of the formed supramolecular polymers by increasing the number of methylene units from 10 to 12 keeping the hydrophilic hexa(ethylene glycol) constant. All bisurea&#8208;based monomers form long, fibrous structures with 3&#8208;5 monomers in the cross&#8208;section in water, indicating a proper hydrophobic\hydrophilic balance. The stability of the supramolecular polymers increases with an increasing amount of methylene units, whereas the dynamic nature of the monomers decreases. The introduction of one Cy3 dye affords modified supramolecular monomers, which co&#8208;assemble with the unmodified monomers into fibrous structures. All systems show excellent water&#8208;compatibility and no toxicity for different cell&#8208;lines. Importantly, in cell culture media, the fibrous structures remain present, highlighting the stability of these supramolecular polymers in physiological conditions. The results obtained here motivate further investigation of these bisurea&#8208;based building blocks as dynamic biomaterial.</dc:description>

         <title>Activated Mn&#8208;MACHO Complexes Form Stable CO2&#160;Adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manganese(I) carbonyl complexes bearing a MACHO&#8208;type ligand (HN(CH2CH2PR2)2) readily react in their amido form with CO2&#160;to generate 4&#8208;membered {Mn&#8208;N&#8208;C&#8208;O} metallacycles. The stability of the adducts decreases with the steric demand of the R groups at phosphorous (R = isopropyl &gt; adamantyl). The CO2&#8208;adducts display generally a lower reactivity as compared to the parent amido complexes. These adducts can thus be interpretated as masked forms of the active amido catalysts and potentially play important roles as off&#8208;loop species or branching points in catalytic transformations of carbon dioxide.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Ionic Li+@C70 Endohedral Fullerene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ion&#8208;endohedral&#8208;fullerene has attracted growing interest due to the unique electronic and structural characteristics arising from its distinctive ionic nature. Although there has been only one reported ion&#8208;encapsulated fullerene, Li+@C60, a significant number of fundamental and applied studies have been conducted, making a substantial impact not only in chemistry and physics but also across various interdisciplinary research fields. Nevertheless, studies on ion&#8208;endohedral fullerenes are still in their infancy due to the limitations in variety, and hence, it remains an open question how the size and symmetry of fullerene, as well as the motion and position of the encapsulated ion, affect their physical/chemical properties. Herein, we report the synthesis of lithium&#8208;ion&#8208;endohedral [70]fullerene (Li+@C70 X&#8722;, X=PF6&#8722; and TFSI&#8722;), a novel ionic endohedral fullerene. X&#8208;ray crystallography confirmed the encapsulation of Li+ by C70 cage as well as its ion&#8208;pair structure stabilized by external TFSI&#8722; counter anion. The encapsulated Li+ drastically lowered the orbital energy of the C70 cage by Coulomb interactions but did not affect the orbital energy gap and degeneracy. DFT studies were also performed, which supported the experimentally observed electronic effects caused by the encapsulated Li+.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphonium&#8208;substituted Diphosphaindenylide (PPI): Exploration of Biradical Character and Ligand Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Starting from C6H4(PCl2)2 and the TMS&#8208;substituted ylide (TMS)2C=PR3 (TMS = trimethylsilyl, R = p&#8208;tolyl), the phosphonium&#8208;substituted diphosphaindenylide PPI was prepared in two steps. CASSCF calculations as well as the reactivity toward diphenyl acetylene suggest a notable biradical character in PPI. Reaction with [Cr(CO)3(MeCN)3] affords the complex [Cr(CO)3(&#951;5&#8208;PPI)] (5). This complex was employed to explore the ligand properties of PPI, which demonstrates considerable potential through the combination of strong metal&#8208;ligand interactions and the possibility of a pronounced indenyl effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Enthalpy Compensation in Solvent Geometry Regulated Supramolecular Polymerization of Luminescent Napthalimide via a Non&#8208;Cooperative, Isodesmic Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymers of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems are an important class of materials with fascinating functions and properties originated from the dynamic behavior and highly ordered molecular organizations. Here, a donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor based functionalized luminescent napthalene monoimide (NMI) undergoes J&#8208;type self&#8208;assembly by non&#8208;covalent interactions via a non&#8208;cooperative, isodesmic mechanism to form supramolecular 1D nanowire. The fundamental insights into the thermodynamics regulating the supramolecular polymerization were derived through the fitting of the isodesmic model to variable temperature UV/Vis data in linear (dodecane) and nonlinear hydrocarbon (decalin) based solvents. This shows a significant role of entropy&#8208;enthalpy compensation in solvent geometry&#8208;regulated formation and stabilization of supramolecular polymer. Furthermore, we have quantitively estimated the influence of solvent geometry and found that NMI forms stronger self&#8208;assembly and spontaneous gel in linear hydrocarbon based solvent compared to nonlinear one and thereby substantially increases the degree of polymerization in linear hydrocarbon solvent (dodecane). This is accredited to the effective influence of the linear hydrocarbon solvent molecules in the polymerization process by favourable van der Waals&#160;interactions with the peripheral alkyl chains of the NMI monomers in contrast to unfavourable interaction of nonlinear hydrocarbon solvent due to geometry mismatch.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding the Poly (Triazine Imide) Crystals Formation Process: The Conversion from Heptazine to Triazine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poly (triazine imide)&#160;(PTI)&#160;generally&#160;obtained via ionothermal synthesis features extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and enhanced crystallinity. However, in&#8208;depth investigation of the polycondensation&#160;process for PTI is an onerous task due to multiple influencing factors and limited characterization techniques. Herein, to&#160;simplify the polymerization route and exclude non&#8208;essential factors, PTI was prepared by calcining only melamine and LiCl. This&#160;study aims to identify the pivotal role of LiCl in PTI formation, which can convert heptazine&#8208;based intermediates into more stable triazine&#8208;based PTI framework. Based on this discovery, we&#160;demonstrate&#160;the transformation process of the prepared samples from amorphous Bulk g&#8208;C3N4&#160;to regular PTI, and further prove that the reaction with LiCl causes disruption of heptazine covalent organic frameworks.&#160;Additionally,&#160;the PTI exhibits higher&#160;photocatalytic water splitting performance due to efficient charge carrier mobility and separation,&#160;as well as&#160;faster reaction kinetics. This discovery deepens understanding&#160;of the polycondensation&#160;process of PTI crystals and provides insights toward the rational design of crystalline carbon nitride&#8208;based semiconductors.</dc:description>

         <title>Remarkable Off&#8211;On Tunable Solid&#8208;State Luminescence by the Regulation of Pyrene Dimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is always a challenge to achieve &#8220;off&#8211;on&#8221; luminescent switch by regulating non&#8208;covalent interactions. Herein, we report a unique strategy for constructing high performance &#8220;off&#8211;on&#8221; tunable luminescent materials utilizing a novel molecule (TFPA) consist of pyrene and cyanostilbene. The pristine crystal of TFPA is almost non&#8208;emissive. Upon grinding/UV irradiation, an obvious luminescence enhancement is observed. Theoretical and experimental results revealed the underlying mechanism of this intriguing &#8220;off&#8211;on&#8220; switching behavior. The non&#8208;emissive crystal consists of ordered H&#8208;aggregates, with adjacent two molecules stacked in an anti&#8208;parallel manner and no overlapped area in pyrene moieties. When external force is applied by grinding or internal force is introduced through the photoisomerization, the dimer structures are facilitated with shorter intermolecular distances and better overlapping of pyrene moieties. In addition, the &#8220;on&#8221; state can recover to &#8220;off&#8221; state under thermal annealing, showing good reversibility and applicability in intelligence material.

Herein, we report a unique strategy for constructing high performance &#8220;off&#8211;on&#8221; tunable luminescent materials utilizing a novel molecule (TFPA) consist of pyrene and cyanostilbene. The pristine crystal of TFPA is almost non-emissive. Upon grinding/UV irradiation, an obvious luminescence enhancement is observed. Theoretical and experimental results revealed the underlying mechanism of this intriguing &#8220;off&#8211;on&#8220; switching behavior. The non-emissive crystal consists of ordered H-aggregates, with adjacent two molecules stacked in an anti-parallel manner and no overlapped area in pyrene moieties. When external force is applied by grinding or internal force is introduced through the photoisomerization, the dimer structures are facilitated with shorter intermolecular distances and better overlapping of pyrene moieties. In addition, the &#8220;on&#8221; state can recover to &#8220;off&#8221; state under thermal annealing, showing good reversibility and applicability in intelligence material. The present results promote an in-depth insight between packing structure and photophysical property, and offer an effective strategy for the construction of luminescence &#8220;off&#8211;on&#8221; switching materials, toward the development of stimuli-responsive luminescent materials for anti-counterfeiting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Unfortunately, the slow redox kinetics and polysulfides shuttle effect are some of the factors that prevent the its development. To address these issues, the hybrid membrane with combination of nickel diselenide nanosheets modified carbon nanotubes (NSN@CNTs) and utilized Li2S6&#160;catholyte for lithium sulfur battery.

Its rate capability is commendable, enabling it to sustain a capacity of 559.8 mAh g&#8208;1&#160;even at a high discharge rate of 2 C. In addition, its initial discharge capacity can remain 8.33 mAh even at 10.8 mg for duration of 100 cycles.

         <title>Colloidal and Thermal Stability of Three&#8208;Component Hybrid Materials Containing Clay Mineral, Polysaccharide and Surfactant</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The paper presents the colloidal and thermal stability of the three&#8208;component hybrid materials containing halloysite, polysaccharides (alginic acid, cationic cellulose and hydroxyethyl cellulose) and Tritons. The obtained results have the application potential in the formation of the materials for the pollutants removal from water and sewages.







Abstract
The paper presents the colloidal and thermal stability of the three&#8208;component hybrid materials containing halloysite, polysaccharides (alginic acid, cationic cellulose and hydroxyethyl cellulose) and Tritons. TX&#8208;100, TX&#8208;165 and TX&#8208;405 were used as non&#8208;ionic surfactants. Stability and other properties of the hybrid materials were tested by the following methods: UV&#8211;Vis, TGA (thermogravimetric analysis) and DSC (differential scanning calorimetry), CHN (elemental analysis), SEM&#8208;EDX (scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy) and tensiometry. According to the results with the increasing polymer concentration the colloidal stability of the tested systems also increases. Moreover, the addition of the surfactants causes the increase of polysaccharide adsorption but the colloidal stability of the tested systems decreases due to large weights of formed aggregates. As follows from the thermal analysis, the comparison of the TG/DTG&#8208;DSC curves obtained for the investigated polymers confirms that their thermal decomposition courses have some common features. The obtained results have the application potential in the formation of the materials for the pollutants removal from water and sewages.

         <title>Unveiling the Potential of Heterogeneous Catalysts for Molecular Solar Thermal Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing compounds that store and release solar energy is crucial for overcoming its intermittent nature. In Molecular Solar Thermal (MOST) systems, a high&#8208;energy photoisomer captures and releases energy. While photoisomerization is well&#8208;studied, back&#8208;conversion using catalysts is underexplored. We compare 27 catalysts in a Norbornadiene/Quadricyclane MOST system, offering insights for effective catalyst development and testing, highlighting the efficiency of Pt based heterogenous catalyst.







Abstract
Solar energy utilization has gained considerable attention due to its abundance and renewability. However, its intermittent nature presents a challenge in harnessing its full potential. The development of energy storing compounds capable of capturing and releasing solar energy on demand has emerged as a potential solution. These compounds undergo a photochemical transformation that results in a high&#8208;energy metastable photoisomer, which stores solar energy in the form of chemical bonds and can release it as heat when required. Such systems are referred to as MOlecular Solar Thermal (MOST)&#8208;systems. Although the photoisomerization of MOST systems has been vastly studied, its back&#8208;conversion, particularly using heterogeneous catalysts, is still underexplored and the development of effective catalysts for releasing stored energy is crucial. Herein we compare the performance of 27 heterogeneous catalysts releasing the stored energy in an efficient Norbornadiene/Quadricyclane (NBD/QC) MOST system. We report the first benchmarking of heterogeneous catalysts for a MOST system using a robust comparison method of the catalysts&#8217; activity and monitoring the conversion using UV&#8208;Visible (UV&#8208;Vis) spectroscopy. Our findings provide insights into the development of effective catalysts for MOST systems. We anticipate that our assay will reveal the necessity of further investigation on heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Influence of Crystallographic Structure and Metal Vacancies on the Oxygen Evolution Reaction Performance of Ni&#8208;based Layered Hydroxides
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#945;&#8208;layered hydroxide (LH) phase with Ni vacancies is the most electroactive catalyst among LH structures containing exclusively Ni(II).







Abstract
Nickel&#8208;based layered hydroxides (LHs) are a family of efficient electrocatalysts for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Nevertheless, fundamental aspects such as the influence of the crystalline structure and the role of lattice distortion of the catalytic sites remain poorly understood and typically muddled. Herein, we carried out a comprehensive investigation on &#593;&#8208;LH, &#946;&#8208;LH and layered double hydroxide (LDH) phases by means of structural, spectroscopical, in&#8208;silico and electrochemical studies, which suggest the key aspect exerted by Ni&#8208;vacancies in the &#593;&#8208;LH structure. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) confirm that the presence of Ni&#8208;vacancies produces acute distortions of the electroactive Ni sites (reflected as the shortening of the Ni&#8722;O distances and changes in the O&#8722;Ni&#8722;O angles), triggering the appearance of Ni localised electronic states on the Fermi level, reducing the Egap, and consequently, increasing the reactivity of the electroactive sites in the &#593;&#8208;LH structure. Furthermore, post&#8208;mortem Raman and XAS measurements unveil its transformation into a highly reactive oxyhydroxide&#8208;like phase that remains stable under ambient conditions. Hence, this work pinpoints the critical role of the crystalline structure as well as the electronic properties of LH structures on their inherent electrochemical reactivity towards OER catalysis. We envision Ni&#8208;based &#593;&#8208;LH as a perfect platform for hosting trivalent cations, closing the gap toward the next generation of benchmark efficient earth&#8208;abundant electrocatalysts.

         <title>Collective Effects of Multiple Fluorine Atoms Causing &#960;&#8208;philic Characteristic within a Caged Polyoxometalate Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The polyanionic Mo132O372 architecture with perfluorinated interior surface favors capturing small non&#8208;aromatic guests carrying &#960;&#8208;bonds in water, which contrasts to the behavior of the non&#8208;fluorinated counterparts. Through systematic and control studies, it is revealed that collective effects of multiple C&#8722;F bonds, rather than the polarity of the individual C&#8722;F bonds, are responsible for the facile guest encapsulation.







Abstract
Perfluorination brings about distinctive properties arising from the unusual nature of the F element, which have been extensively developed in materials science and chemistry. Herein we report that the construction of F&#8208;rich inner space within a hollowed Mo132O372 cage ([Mo132O372(OCOR)30(H2O)72]42&#8722;) leads to the emergence of unique guest binding activities in encapsulation. Prominently, the trifluoroacetate&#8208;modified cage (R=CF3, 2) having as many as 90 F groups inside favors trapping cyclopentadiene (Cp), which is hardly trapped by the non&#8208;fluorinated counterpart (R=CH3, 1). Systematic studies using related hydrocarbons show that the amount of the encapsulated guest is correlated with the unsaturation degree of the guests, implying the involvement of the attractive interaction of the CF3&#8208;modified interior wall with the guest &#960;&#8208;electron clouds. Control experiments using the semi&#8208;fluorinated analogues (R=CF2H, CFH2) reveal that the perfluorination is a critical factor to facilitate the Cp encapsulation by 2, indicating that collective effects of polar C&#8722;F bonds spreading over the interior surface, rather than the polarity of the individual C&#8722;F bonds, are responsible. We also provide a successful example of the physical molecular confinement within the cage through the &#8220;ship&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;bottle&#8221; Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between trapped diene and dienophile.

&lt;p&gt;The polyanionic Mo&lt;sub&gt;132&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;372&lt;/sub&gt; architecture with perfluorinated interior surface favors capturing small non-aromatic guests carrying &#960;-bonds in water, which contrasts to the behavior of the non-fluorinated counterparts. Through systematic and control studies, it is revealed that collective effects of multiple C&#8722;F bonds, rather than the polarity of the individual C&#8722;F bonds, are responsible for the facile guest encapsulation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfluorination brings about distinctive properties arising from the unusual nature of the F element, which have been extensively developed in materials science and chemistry. Herein we report that the construction of F-rich inner space within a hollowed Mo&lt;sub&gt;132&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;372&lt;/sub&gt; cage ([Mo&lt;sub&gt;132&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;372&lt;/sub&gt;(OCOR)&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;72&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;42&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) leads to the emergence of unique guest binding activities in encapsulation. Prominently, the trifluoroacetate-modified cage (R=CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) having as many as 90 F groups inside favors trapping cyclopentadiene (Cp), which is hardly trapped by the non-fluorinated counterpart (R=CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;). Systematic studies using related hydrocarbons show that the amount of the encapsulated guest is correlated with the unsaturation degree of the guests, implying the involvement of the attractive interaction of the CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-modified interior wall with the guest &#960;-electron clouds. Control experiments using the semi-fluorinated analogues (R=CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H, CFH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) reveal that the perfluorination is a critical factor to facilitate the Cp encapsulation by &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, indicating that collective effects of polar C&#8722;F bonds spreading over the interior surface, rather than the polarity of the individual C&#8722;F bonds, are responsible.

         <title>Elucidating the Electronic Nature of Rh&#8208;based Paddlewheel Catalysts from 103Rh NMR Chemical Shifts: Insights from Quantum Mechanical Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For heteroleptic dirhodium paddlewheel complexes, the NMR shifts of the two chemically different Rh are more than 1000&#8197;ppm apart. In line with symmetry considerations, the shielding tensor responds only to the donor ability of the equatorial ligands along the perpendicular principal axis. Axial ligands, in contrast, have no direct effect on shielding but may come into play via the electronic cis&#8208;effect onto the neighboring equatorial sites.







Abstract
The tremendous importance of dirhodium paddlewheel complexes for asymmetric catalysis is largely the result of an empirical optimization of the chiral ligand sphere about the bimetallic core. It was only recently that a H(C)Rh triple resonance 103Rh NMR experiment provided the long&#8208;awaited opportunity to examine &#8211; with previously inconceivable accuracy &#8211; how variation of the ligands impacts on the electronic structure of such catalysts. The recorded effects are dramatic: formal replacement of only one out of eight O&#8208;atoms surrounding the metal centers in a dirhodium tetracarboxylate by an N&#8208;atom results in a shielding of the corresponding Rh&#8208;site of no less than 1000&#8197;ppm. The current paper provides the theoretical framework that allows this and related experimental observations made with a set of 19 representative rhodium complexes to be interpreted. In line with symmetry considerations, it is shown that the shielding tensor responds only to the donor ability of the equatorial ligands along the perpendicular principal axis. Axial ligands, in contrast, have no direct effect on shielding but may come into play via the electronic 
&#8208;effect that they exert onto the neighboring equatorial sites. On top of these fundamental interactions, charge redistribution within the core as well as the electronic 
&#8208;effect of ligands of different donor strengths is reflected in the recorded 103Rh NMR shifts.

         <title>Stabilization of sp&#8208;Hybridized Nitrogen Cation by Lewis Acid&#8208;Base Complex Formation with Intramolecular Iodine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anchimeric interaction with an sp&#8208;hybridized nitrogen cation with iodine affords an isolable acid&#8208;base complex. The N&#8722;I bonding is non&#8208;covalent but rather strong, while the O&#8722;I bond of the ligand is ionic and weak, facilitating ligand exchange in the presence of a Br&#248;nsted acid. The generated I+ cation species can be employed for &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation of ketones.







Abstract
Here we show that the sp&#8208;hybridized nitrogen cation is strongly stabilized by a peri&#8208;iodine substituent in the tetralone system. The cation is captured by anionic species such as CF3CO2&#8722;, affording hypervalent iodine(III) compounds with a short nitrogen&#8208;iodine (N&#8722;I) bond, in which the cation serves as a Lewis acid. Notably, the O&#8722;I bond of the O&#8208;trifluoroacetate or O&#8208;acetate is intrinsically weaker than the N&#8722;I bond due to its more ionic character and is further weakened by protonation in trifluoroacetic acid. As a result, the oxygen ligand can dissociate in the presence of a Br&#248;nsted acid, affording a I+ cation intermediate that retains the N&#8722;I bond. We isolated the cation as the tetrafluoroborate, and characterized it experimentally by 1H NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray structure analysis, and theoretically by means of DFT calculation. The results suggest that the N&#8722;I bonded cation is intrinsically stable, and is weakly coordinated with water and the BF4 counter anion or trifluoroacetate anion. This cation can be employed as a reagent for &#945;&#8208;oxidation of ketones.

         <title>Collective Synthesis of Sarpagine and Macroline Alkaloid&#8208;Inspired Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A compound collection inspired by both biology&#8208;oriented synthesis and pseudo&#8208;natural product design concepts was rapidly accessed by divergent synthesis. Biological evaluation revealed compounds derived from different design principles have different bioactivity profiles.







Abstract
Design strategies that can access natural&#8208;product&#8208;like chemical space in an efficient manner may facilitate the discovery of biologically relevant compounds. We have employed a divergent intermediate strategy to construct an indole alkaloid&#8208;inspired compound collection derived from two different molecular design principles, i.e. biology&#8208;oriented synthesis and pseudo&#8208;natural products. The divergent intermediate was subjected to acid&#8208;catalyzed or newly discovered Sn&#8208;mediated conditions to selectively promote intramolecular C&#8208; or N&#8208;acylation, respectively. After further derivatization, a collection totalling 84&#8197;compounds representing four classes was obtained. Morphological profiling via the cell painting assay coupled with a subprofile analysis showed that compounds derived from different design principles have different bioactivity profiles. The subprofile analysis suggested that a pseudo&#8208;natural product class is enriched in modulators of tubulin, and subsequent assays led to the identification of compounds that suppress in&#8197;vitro tubulin polymerization and mitotic progression.

         <title>Fluorescent Phenotyping of Blood Cells Using a Differential Sensing Strategy: Differentiating Physiological Aging Stages and Neuro&#8208;Degenerative Disease Drugs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

A differential sensing approach is demonstrated to distinguish distinct aging status of mouse using TCF probes. Despite there is no reliable CD markers selective for aging progress, cross&#8208;reactivity of TCF probes generates unique fingerprint of aging by blood cell analysis.







Abstract
Blood continually contributes to the maintenance of homeostasis of the body and contains information regarding the health state of an individual. However, current hematological analyses predominantly rely on a limited number of CD markers and morphological analysis. In this work, differentially sensitive fluorescent compounds based on TCF scaffolds are introduced that are designed for fluorescent phenotyping of blood. Depending on their structures, TCF compounds displayed varied responses to reactive oxygen species, biothiols, redox&#8208;related biomolecules, and hemoglobin, which are the primary influential factors within blood. Contrary to conventional CD marker&#8208;based analysis, this unbiased fluorescent phenotyping method produces diverse fingerprints of the health state. Precise discrimination of blood samples from 37&#8197;mice was demonstrated based on their developmental stages, ranging from 10 to 19&#8197;weeks of age. Additionally, this fluorescent phenotyping method enabled the differentiation between drugs with distinct targets, serving as a simple yet potent tool for pharmacological analysis to understand the mode of action of various drugs.

         <dc:description>
Gram&#8208;scale, recyclable, chiral phase&#8208;transfer catalysts derived from calix&#8208;crown supramolecules have been designed and developed for asymmetric Henry reaction with diverse substrate scopes under mild reaction conditions. The catalysts proved to be very efficient with ~99&#8201;% yield and ~99.8&#8201;% enantioselectivity for 25 test cycles. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Malik, P.&#8197;R. Sharma and R.&#8197;K. Sharma (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302638).

         <title>An Indacenopicene&#8208;based Buckybowl Catcher for Recognition of Fullerenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel buckybowl catcher with an extended &#960;&#8208;surface has been synthesized by cross&#8208;coupling two bowl&#8208;shaped bromoindacenopicene moieties with a tolyl linker. The resulting binding values show a higher affinity of the catcher towards C70 over C60. The designed catcher demonstrated the fundamental possibility of creating sensors for spherical aromaticity. The catcher carefully framing the C70 fullerene is visualized as a miraculous, marvelous Faberg&#233; artwork. More information can be found in the Research Article by A.&#8197;S. Oshchepkov, K.&#8197;Y. Amsharov, M.&#8197;E. P&#233;rez&#8208;Ojeda et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302778).

         <title>Hierarchically Porous Covalent Organic Frameworks: Synthesis Methods and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high porosity have garnered considerable interest for various applications owing to their robust and customizable structure. However, conventional COFs are hindered by their narrow pore size, which poses limitations for applications such as heterogeneous catalysis and guest delivery that typically involve large molecules. The development of hierarchically porous COF (HP&#8208;COF), featuring a multi&#8208;scale aperture distribution, offers a promising solution by significantly enhancing the diffusion capacity and mass transfer for larger molecules. This review focuses on the recent advances in the synthesis strategies of HP&#8208;COF materials, including topological structure design, in&#8208;situ templating, monolithic COF synthesis, defect engineering, and crystalline self&#8208;transformation. The specific operational principles and affecting factors in the synthesis process are summarized and discussed, along with the applications of HP&#8208;COFs in heterogeneous catalysis, toxic component treatment, optoelectronics, and the biomedical field. Overall, this review builds a bridge to understand HP&#8208;COFs and provides guidance for further development of them on synthesis strategies and applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Skeletal Editing through Molecular Recombination of 2H&#8208;Indazoles to Azo&#8208;Linked&#8208;Quinazolinones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new protocol by the combinatory use of two equivalent of indazoles starting material with one being the carbon source via its C3&#8208;reactivity and the other, the coupling partner has been developed for the selectfluor&#8208;mediated single atom skeletal editing of 2H&#8208;indazoles. The azo&#8208;linked&#8208;2,3&#8208;disubstituted quinazolin&#8208;4&#8208;one derivatives were obtained through a carbon atom insertion between the two nitrogens of the indazole ring and simultaneous oxidation at C3 position of both inzadole moieties. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the amidic carbonyl oxygen of the product is derived from water and the reaction proceeds through in&#8208;situ generated N&#8208;centred indazolone radical intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of Unusual Ajmaline&#8208;Macroline Type Bisindole Alkaloids from Alstonia macrophylla by Building Blocks&#8208;Based Molecular Networking</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three unusual ajmaline&#8208;macroline type bisindole alkaloids, alsmaphylines A&#8722;C, together with their postulated biogenetic precursors, were isolated from the stem barks and leaves of&#160;Alstonia macrophylla via the building blocks&#8208;based molecular network (BBMN) strategy. Alsmaphyline A represents&#160;a rare ajmaline&#8208;macroline type bisindole alkaloid with an S&#8208;shape polycyclic ring system. Alsmaphylines B and C are two novel ajmaline&#8208;macroline type bisindole alkaloids with N&#8208;1&#8722;C&#8208;21'&#160;linkages, and the former possesses an unconventional stacked conformation due to the presence of intramolecular noncovalent interactions. The chemical structures including absolute configurations of alsmaphylines A&#8722;C were established by&#160;comprehensive spectroscopic analyses,&#160;electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculations, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. In addition, a plausible biosynthetic pathway&#160;of these bisindole alkaloids as well as their ability to promote the protein synthesis on HT22 cells were discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Non&#8208;Solvated Dialkylalumanyl Anion and XPS Characterization of Al(I) and Al(II) Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A non&#8208;solvated alkyl&#8208;substituted Al(I) anion dimer was synthesized by a reduction of haloalumane precursor using a mechanochemical method. The crystallographic and theoretical analysis revealed its structure and electronic properties. Experimental XPS analysis of the Al(I) anions with reference compounds revealed the lower Al 2p binding energy corresponds to the lower oxidation state of Al species. It should be emphasized that the experimentally obtained XPS binding energies were reproduced by delta SCF calculations and were linearly correlated with NPA charges and 2p orbital energies.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic and Thermodynamic Control of Supramolecular Aggregation of Near Infrared Pyrrolopyrrole Cyanine Fluorophores Confined in Colloidal Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Control of the intermolecular aggregation of organic &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules as chromophores is crucial for tuning their physical properties such as light absorption/emission, and energy and charge transfer. Lots of advances have been achieved in control of intermolecular aggregation of organic chromophores in solid states where an indefinitely large number of molecules are involved. However, much less understanding has been gained at a mesoscale of aggregates formed by well&#8208;defined organization of a deterministic number of chromophores, which has been realized in natural photosynthetic systems but still remains rare in manmade materials. Here, we report both the kinetic and the thermodynamic control of the supramolecular aggregation of a near&#8208;infrared cyanine dye, PPcy, and its derivatives confined in colloidal nanoparticles stabilized by surfactants in aqueous media. Our results demonstrate that both the aggregation number, the aggregation state and the optical properties of the PPcy chromophores are controllable through optimization of the alkyl and polymer chains tethered from PPcy, the effective concentration of the chromophore inside each particle, and the surfactants utilized to stabilize the colloids in water.</dc:description>

         <title>Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction Using Palladium Catalysts Supported on Phosphine Periodic Mesoporous Organosilica</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphine periodic mesoporous organosilicas (R&#8208;P&#8208;PMO&#8208;TMS: R = Ph, tBu), which possess electron&#8208;donating alkyl substituents on the phosphorus atom, were synthesized using bifunctional compounds with alkoxysilyl&#8208; and phosphino groups, bis[3&#8208;(triethoxysilyl)propyl]phenylphosphine borane (1a) and bis[3&#8208;(triethoxysilyl)propyl]&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphine borane (1b). Immobilization of Pd(0) species was performed to give R&#8208;P&#8208;Pd&#8208;PMO&#8208;TMS: R = Ph (2a), tBu (3a), respectively. The Pd(0) immobilized 2a and 3a were applicable as catalysts for Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions of aryl chlorides with phenylboronic acid. It was revealed that 3a bearing more electron&#8208;donating tBu groups exhibited higher catalytic activity. Various functional groups including both electron withdrawing and donating substituents were compatible in the system. The recyclability of 3a was examined to support its moderate utility for the recycle use.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorinated Polymer Donors for Nonfullerene Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid development of narrow&#8208;bandgap non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) has boosted the efficiency of organic solar cells over 19%. The new features of high&#8208;performance NFAs, such as visible&#8208;NIR light absorption, moderate HOMO, and high crystallinity, require polymer donors with matching physical properties. This emphasizes the importance of methods that can effectively tune the physical properties of polymers. Owning to very small atom size and strongest electronegativity, the fluorination has been proved the most efficient strategy to regulate the physical properties of polymer donors, including frontier energy level, absorption coefficient, dielectric constant, crystallinity and charge transport. Owing to the success of fluorination strategy, the vast majority of high&#8208;performance polymer donors possess one or more fluorine atoms. In this review, the fluorination synthetic methods, the synthetic route of well&#8208;known fluorinated building blocks, the fluorinated polymers which are categorized by the type of donor or acceptor units, and the relationships between the polymer structures, properties, and photovoltaic performances are comprehensively surveyed. We hope this review could provide the readers a deeper insight into fluorination strategy and lay a strong foundation for future innovation of fluorinated polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Detecting protein&#8208;ligand interactions with nitroxide based paramagnetic cosolutes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NMR spectroscopy techniques can provide important information about protein&#8208;ligand interactions. Here we tested an NMR approach which relies on the measurement of paramagnetic relaxation enhancements (PREs) arising from analogous cationic, anionic or neutral soluble nitroxide molecules, which distribute around the protein&#8208;ligand complex depending on near&#8208;surface electrostatic potentials. We applied this approach to two protein&#8208;ligand systems, interleukin&#8208;8 interacting with highly charged glycosaminoglycans and the SH2 domain of Grb2 interacting with less charged phospho&#8208;tyrosine tripeptides. The electrostatic potential around interleukin&#8208;8 and its changes upon binding of glycosaminoglycans could be derived from the PRE data and confirmed by theoretical predictions from Poisson&#8208;Boltzmann calculations. The ligand influence on the PREs and NMR&#8208;derived electrostatic potentials of Grb2 SH2 was localized to a narrow protein region which allowed the localization of the peptide binding pocket. Our analysis suggests that experiments with nitroxide cosolutes can be useful for investigating protein&#8208;ligand electrostatic interactions and mapping ligand binding sites.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Electrochemically generated hypervalent iodine(III) species are powerful reagents for oxidative C&#8208;N coupling reactions, providing access to valuable N&#8208;heterocycles. A new electrocatalytic hypervalent iodine(III)&#8208;mediated in&#8208;cell synthesis of 1H&#8208;N&#8208;aryl&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroquinolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones by dehydrogenative C&#8208;N bond formation is presented. Catalytic amounts of the redox mediator, a low supporting electrolyte concentration and recycling of the solvent used make this method a sustainable alternative to electrochemical ex&#8208;cell or conventional approaches. Furthermore, inexpensive, readily available electrode materials and a simple galvanostatic set&#8208;up are applied. The broad functional group tolerance could be demonstrated by synthesizing 23 examples in yields up to 96%, with one reaction being performed on a 10&#8208;fold higher scale. Based on the obtained results a sound reaction mechanism could be proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;mediated N&#8208;Trifluoromethylation of O&#8209;Benzoylhydroxylamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of trifluoromethyl containing compounds is well established within medicinal chemistry, with a range of approved drugs containing C&#8208;CF3 and O&#8208;CF3 moieties. However, the utilisation of the N&#8209;CF3 functional group remains relatively unexplored. This may be attributed to the challenging synthesis of this unit, with many current methods employing harsh conditions or less accessible reagents. A robust methodology for the N&#8208;trifluoromethylation of secondary amines has been developed, which employs an umpolung strategy in the form of a copper&#8209;catalysed electrophilic amination. The method is operationally simple, uses mild, inexpensive reagents, and has been used to synthesise a range of novel, structurally complex N&#8208;CF3 containing compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Mediated Amination of Pyrogallol&#8208;Based Polyphenols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flavonoids are known to covalently modify amyloidogenic peptides by amination reactions. The underlying coupling process between polyphenols and N&#8208;nucleophiles is assessed by several in vitro and in silico approaches. The coupling reaction involves a sequence of oxidative dearomatization, amination, and reductive amination (ODARA) reaction steps. The C6&#8208;regioselectivity of the product is confirmed by crystallographic analysis. Under aqueous conditions, the reaction of baicalein with lysine derivatives yields C&#8208;N coupling as well as hydrolysis products of transient imine intermediates. The observed C&#8208;N coupling reactions work best for flavonoids combining a pyrogallol substructure with an electron&#8208;withdrawing group attached to the C4a&#8208;position. Thermodynamic properties such as bond dissociation energies also highlight the key role of pyrogallol units for the antioxidant ability. Combining the computed electronic properties and in vitro antioxidant assays suggests that the studied pyrogallol&#8208;containing flavonoids act by various radical&#8208;scavenging mechanisms working in synergy. Multivariate analysis indicates that a small number of descriptors for transient intermediates of the ODARA process generates a model with excellent performance (r=0.93) for the prediction of cross&#8208;coupling yields. The same model has been employed to predict novel antioxidant flavonoid&#8208;based molecules are considered as potential covalent inhibitors, opening a new avenue to the design of therapeutically relevant anti&#8208;amyloid compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Multifunctional Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have recently drawn intense attention due to their potential applications in photocatalysis. Herein, we report a multifunctional COF which consists of triphenylamine (TPA) and 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (2, 2&#8217;&#8208;bipy) entities. The obtained TAPA&#8208;BPy&#8208;COF is a heterogeneous photocatalyst and can efficiently catalyze the oxidative coupling of thiols to disulfides. In addition, TAPA&#8208;BPy&#8208;COF can be further metalated by Pd(II) via 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipy&#8208;metal coordination. The generated Pd@TAPA&#8208;BPy&#8208;COF can highly promote photocatalytic synthesis of 3&#8208;cyanopyridines via cascade addition/cyclization of arylboronic acids with &#947;&#8208;ketodinitriles in heterogeneous way. This work has demonstrated the way for the rational design and preparation of more efficient photoactive COFs for photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We use MOFs material as precursor to synthesize carbon based two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials loaded with In&#8208;S&#8208;O nanoparticles. The In&#8208;S&#8208;O nanoparticles have exhibited Janus architecture composed of two compounds with different crystal structures that are combined in&#8208;plane on two&#8208;dimensional carbon material surface. The excellent properties of this in&#8208;plane Janus material include 2D nanoarchitecture and its Janus properties formed by combining two different crystal structures. It has exhibited excellent electrochemical performances due to its abundant electrochemical active sites and large specific surface area. According to experiments, the electron transfer number of the material for two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction is about 2.4, and the hydrogen peroxide yield is 32 mg /h cm2. In the further &#160;test of liquid flow electrolytic cell, the yield can reach up to 172 mg /h cm2</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;Based Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Sheet&#8208;Like Supramolecular Metallohydrogel Organized by Using a Native Ultrashort Peptide Sequence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing supramolecular hydrogels using short peptides is challenging. To control self&#8208;assembly, a certain amount of organic solvent is typically added to the system, or the short peptide is modified with a functional group that is hydrophobic, hydrophilic, or highly coordinative. We discovered that l&#8208;His&#8208;l&#8208;Ile&#8208;l&#8208;Thr (HIT), a very short unmodified &#8220;native&#8221; tripeptide, selectively responds to Cu2+ ions in pure water to form a transparent supramolecular metallohydrogel. Circular dichroism analysis revealed that Cu2+ ions, but no other metal species, caused HIT to change from a random&#8208;coil&#8208;like to a &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;like structure. Other spectroscopic methods were used to characterize the properties of the supramolecular metallohydrogel. These results are expected to facilitate the development of native short peptides as advanced functional biomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>New Multifunctional Bipyrimidine&#8208;Based Chromophores for NLO&#8208;Active Thin&#8208;Film Preparation
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, the preparation of bipyrimidine&#8208;based chromophores presenting alkoxystyryl donor groups carrying aliphatic achiral and chiral chains on the 4 position is described. Symmetry breaking by judicious functionalization of 3D organic octupoles allows the emergence of multifunctional liquid crystalline or crystalline chromophores, which can easily be processed into large, flexible, thin and self&#8208;oriented films presenting second harmonic generation response.







Abstract
New synthesized bipyrimidine&#8208;based chromophores presenting alkoxystyryl donor groups carrying aliphatic achiral and chiral chains in the 4 position, connected to electron&#8208;accepting 2,2&#8208;bipyrimidine cores have been synthesized. Their linear and nonlinear optical (NLO) properties were investigated as well as their mesomorphic properties by various techniques (light&#8208;transmission measurements, polarized&#8208;light optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry measurements and two&#8208;photon excited fluorescence). The derivatives with achiral linear carbon chains were found to exhibit liquid&#8208;crystal properties with the formation smectic phases over large temperature ranges, which were confirmed by small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering analysis via stacking models. The nonlinear optical properties in the solid state for derivatives with C14 and the citronellol chains have been studied by wide&#8208;field second&#8208;harmonic generation and multi&#8208;photon fluorescence imaging, confirming centrosymmetry for these achiral mesogens and their excellent third&#8208;order nonlinearity whereas the chiral compound exhibits non&#8208;centrosymmetric organization resulting in a strong Second Harmonic Generation at the crystal state.

A new series of unsymmetrical phenyl tellurides derived from 2&#8208;N&#8208;(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)benzamide has been synthesized by copper&#8208;catalyzed method using diaryl ditelluride. Further, monotellurides were converted into corresponding tellurium cations. Next, these Lewis acidic tellurium cations were used as catalysts to synthesize 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines from anilines and highly regioselective creation of &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols from epoxides.







Abstract
A new series of unsymmetrical phenyl tellurides derived from 2&#8208;N&#8208;(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl) benzamide ligand has been synthesized in a practical manner by the copper&#8208;catalyzed method by using diaryl ditelluride and Mg as a reductant at room temperature. In order to augment the Lewis acidity of these newly formed unsymmetrical monotellurides, these have been transformed into corresponding unsymmetrical 2&#8208;N&#8208;(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)benzamide tellurium cations. Subsequently, these Lewis acidic tellurium cations were used as chalcogen bonding catalysts, enabling the synthesis of various substituted 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines by activating ketones with anilines under mild conditions. Moreover, the synthesized 2&#8208;N&#8208;(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)benzamide phenyl tellurium cation has also catalyzed the formation of &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols in high regioselectivity by effectively activating epoxides at room temperature. Mechanistic insight by 1H and 19F NMR study, electrostatic surface potential (ESP map), control reaction in which tellurium cation reacted explosively with epoxide, suggested that the enhanced Lewis acidity of tellurium center seems responsible for efficient catalytic activities under mild conditions enabling &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols with excellent regioselectivity and 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines with trifluoromethyl, nitro, and pyridylsubstitution, which were difficult to access.

         <title>Cyano Decoration of &#960;&#8208;Bridge to Boost Photoluminescence and Electroluminescence Quantum Yields of Triazine/Carbazole Based Blue TADF Emitter</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating less bulky cyano group to replace methyl on &#960; bridge of donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor molecule instead strengthened the thermally activated delayed fluorescence feature through enhancing intramolecular charge transfer, and boosted photoluminescence quantum yield from 40&#8201;% to 94&#8201;% by increasing HOMO&#8208;LUMO overlap, finally led to an EQE of 14&#8201;% in blue OLED.







Abstract
In general, a large donor&#8208;acceptor dihedral angle is required to guarantee sufficient frontier molecular orbitals separation for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters, which is intrinsically unfavorable for the radiative transition. We present a molecular design method favoring both reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) and radiative transitions even at a moderate D&#8722;A angle. A blue TADF emitter TrzBuCz&#8208;CN was designed with triazine/tert&#8208;butylcarbazole as donor/acceptor and cyano (CN) incorporated on the phenylene bridge. In comparison with the methyl decoration in similar way (TrzBuCz&#8722;Me), CN decoration reduced the D&#8722;A dihedral angle from 70&#176; to 60&#176;, which is intrinsically not favorable for sufficient FMO separation, but unexpectedly reduced the singlet and triplet energy gap (&#916;EST) and thus facilitated TADF feature by pulling down the lowest singlet state energy. While the reduced distorsion instead improved the HOMO&#8208;LUMO overlap and boosted the fluorescence quantum yield from 41&#8201;% to 94&#8201;%. The blue organic light&#8208;emitting diode of TrzBuCz&#8208;CN exhibited an external quantum efficiency of 13.7&#8201;% with emission peak at 466&#8197;nm, greatly superior to 6.0&#8201;% of TrzBuCz&#8722;Me. The result provides a feasible design strategy to facilitate both RISC and radiation processes by CN decoration of the linking bridge of TADF emitters.

         <title>Deciphering Iron&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Amination with Organic Azides: N2 Cleavage from a Stable Organoazide Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elucidating the mechanism of C&#8722;H amination with organic azides: a stable iron &#945;&#8208;N coordinated organoazide complex that is in fast equilibrium between the free and coordinated state undergoes gradual N2 loss, demonstrated by NMR kinetics, M&#246;ssbauer measurements, photo&#8208;crystallography, and DFT calculations.







Abstract
Catalytic C&#8722;N bond formation by direct activation of C&#8722;H bonds offers wide synthetic potential. En route to C&#8722;H amination, complexes with organic azides are critical precursors towards the reactive nitrene intermediate. Despite their relevance, &#945;&#8208;N coordinated organoazide complexes are scarce in general, and elusive with iron, although iron complexes are by far the most active catalysts for C&#8722;H amination with organoazides. Herein, we report the synthesis of a stable iron &#945;&#8208;N coordinated organoazide complex from [Fe(N(SiMe3)2)2] and AdN3 (Ad=1&#8208;adamantyl) and its crystallographic, IR, NMR and zero&#8208;field 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopic characterization. These analyses revealed that the organoazide is in fast equilibrium between the free and coordinated state (Keq=62). Photo&#8208;crystallography experiments showed gradual dissociation of N2, which imparted an Fe&#8722;N bond shortening and correspond to structural snapshots of the formation of an iron imido/nitrene complex. Reactivity of the organoazide complex in solution showed complete loss of N2, and subsequent formation of a C&#8722;H aminated product via nitrene insertion into a C&#8722;H bond of the N(SiMe3)2 ligand. Monitoring this reaction by 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy indicates the transient formation of the imido/nitrene intermediate, which was supported by M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy in frozen solution.

         <title>Organic Photothermal Materials Obtained Using Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Design Principles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
There's a twist! Organic photothermal materials based on the anilino&#8208;naphthalenediimide (ANDI) acceptor are rationally designed using sterically hindered donors with a large dihedral angle to reduce radiative processes. The ANDI materials demonstrate near&#8208;infrared absorbance and high photothermal conversion efficiencies upon encapsulation into nanoparticles.







Abstract
Organic small molecules with high photothermal conversion efficiencies that absorb near&#8208;infrared light are desirable for photothermal therapy due to their improved biocompatibility compared to inorganic materials and their ability to absorb light in the biological transparency window (650&#8211;1350&#8197;nm). Here we report three donor&#8208;acceptor organic materials DM&#8208;ANDI, O&#8208;ANDI, and S&#8208;ANDI that show high photothermal conversion efficiencies of 46&#8211;68&#8201;% with near&#8208;infrared absorption. The design of these molecules is based on the rational modification of a thermally activated delayed fluorescence material to favour a low photoluminescence quantum yield by reducing HOMO&#8208;LUMO overlap. Encapsulating these materials into either neat nanoparticles or aggregated organic dots modulates their photothermal conversion efficiencies, and also facilitates dispersion in water.

         <title>Easy to Use DFT Approach for Computational pKa Determination of Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computational chemistry has an intrinsically green approach, as it gives us the possibility to predict molecular properties, such as the pKa, thereby avoiding time&#8208;consuming experiments. It combines the past of experimental chemistry with the future. In the cartoon, our DFT&#8208;based &#8220;easy&#8208;to&#8208;use&#8208;methodology&#8221; is shown. Note the accurate result in predicting the pKa values of trifluoro&#8208; and trichloroacetic acid, easily obtained by adding two water molecules at the reaction centre. More information can be found in the Research Article by F. Sabuzi and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303167).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Computational chemistry&lt;/b&gt; has an intrinsically green approach, as it gives us the possibility to predict molecular properties, such as the p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, thereby avoiding time-consuming experiments. It combines the past of experimental chemistry with the future. In the cartoon, our DFT-based &#8220;easy-to-use-methodology&#8221; is shown. Note the accurate result in predicting the p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values of trifluoro- and trichloroacetic acid, easily obtained by adding two water molecules at the reaction centre.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Generation of Diarylisonaphthofuran and Its Mechanochemical Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction with Epoxynaphthalene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state generation of diarylisonaphthofurans from 1,3&#8208;diaryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydronaphthofuranols is reported in this work. The generated reactive molecules were stable in the solid state and could be stored without any precaution. Furthermore, the mechanochemical Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of 1,3&#8208;diarylisonaphthofurans with epoxynaphthalenes afforded synthetically attractive diepoxypentacenes. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Hamura et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302660).

         <title>Barbier polymerization&#8208;induced emission&#160;towards fully substituted polyethylene analogues with non&#8208;traditional intrinsic luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The properties of polyethylene are highly dependent on the variety and quantity of substitutions. Generally, polyethylene can only be fully substituted with fluorine atoms mainly, e.g., polytetrafluoroethylene and nafion, because atomic radius of fluorine atom is small enough. The preparation of fully substituted polyethylene analogues (FSPEA) and their non&#8208;traditional intrinsic luminescence (NTIL) are attractive, especially for substitutions with relatively larger atomic radius than fluorine atom. Here, Barbier polymerization&#8208;induced emission (PIE) is demonstrated as a universal method for the molecular design of NTIL type FSPEAs with intriguing aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behaviors. Through Barbier polymerization of diphenyldichloromethane and different peroxyesters in the presence of Mg in one pot, a series of FSPEAs, including polytriphenylethanol (PTPE), polydiphenylfurylethanol (PDPFE), polydiphenylthiophenylethanol (PDPTE) and polydiphenylnaphthylethanol (PDPNE) have been successfully prepared. Further potential applications for explosive detection, artificial light&#8208;harvesting system and white phosphor&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diode are investigated. Therefore, this work opens up a new approach for the molecular design of FSPEA with non&#8208;conjugated luminescence, which may cause inspirations to different research fields like polyolefin and luminescent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Hypervalent Iodine Diazo Compounds and Their Application in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aim of this review is to give an overview of diazomethyl&#8208;substituted iodine(III) compounds in synthesis and application.







Abstract
Diazomethyl&#8208;substituted iodine(III) compounds with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (EWG) connected to diazo methyl center were a type of donor&#8208;acceptor diazo compounds with potential reaction abilities similar to ordinary diazo compounds. Although several diazomethyl&#8208;substituted iodine(III) compounds were synthesized and used in the nucleophilic substitution reactions as early as 1994, the synthesis and application of new iodine(III) diazo compounds have only been reported to a certain extent in recent years. In the presence of rhodium catalyst, photocatalyst, or nucleophiles, diazomethyl&#8208;substituted iodine(III) compounds can be converted into rhodium&#8208;carbenes, diazomethyl radicals, ester radicals or nucleophilic intermediates, which can be used as key intermediates for the formation of chemical bonds. The aim of this review is to give an overview of diazomethyl&#8208;substituted iodine(III) compounds in organic synthesis.

         <title>Doubly Bridged Anthracenes: Blue Emitters for OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of bridged anthracenes was synthesized and their photostabilities were accessed. While the length of the bridges only plays a minor role, introduction of electron withdrawing ester&#8208;based linkers retards photooxidation most. Those esters bridged anthracenes could be prepared in reasonable yields and &#8220;proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle&#8221; organic light emitting diodes with deep blue emission were built, demonstrating their potential as emitters.







Abstract
The photooxidative stability of a series of doubly bridged anthracenes was evaluated after their preparation via twofold macrocyclization of a bis(resorcinyl)anthracene. Lightfastness correlates with the energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), resulting in superior stability of the tetraesters compared to the tetraethers. The lengths and steric demand of the linker only plays a minor role for the ester&#8208;based compounds, which can be prepared in reasonable yields and thus tested in proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. Double ester&#8208;bridging allows deep blue electro&#8208;luminescence, highlighting the importance of the choice of the functional groups used for macrocyclization.

         <title>Confining Ionic Liquids in Developing Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progress and achievement of using IL&#8208;confinement in developing quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes for lithium metal batteries are surveyed, summarized, and analyzed, and the influence of specific parameters was discussed, indicating that the IL&#8208;confinement improves the performance of electrolytes, and the IL&#8208;confinement concept in the battery area is in a broad extent.







Abstract
The concept of confining ionic liquids (ILs) in developing quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes (QSSEs) has been proposed, where ILs are dispersed in polymer networks/backbones and/or filler/host pores, forming the so&#8208;called confinement, and great research progress and promising research results have been achieved. In this review, the progress and achievement in developing QSSEs using IL&#8208;confinement for lithium metal batteries (LMBs), together with advanced characterizations and simulations, were surveyed, summarized, and analyzed, where the influence of specific parameters, such as IL (type, content, etc.), substrate (type, structure, surface properties, etc.), confinement methods, and so on, was discussed. The confinement concept was further compared with the conventional one in other research areas. It indicates that the IL&#8208;confinement in QSSEs improves the performance of electrolytes, for example, increasing the ionic conductivity, widening the electrochemical window, and enhancing the cycle performance of the assembled cells, and being different from those in other areas, that is, the IL&#8208;confinement concept in the battery area is in a broad extent. Finally, insights into developing QSSEs in LMBs with the confinement strategy were provided to promote the development and application of QSSE LMBs.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Vibronic Coupling Controls the Intersystem Crossing of Iodine&#8208;Substituted BODIPY Triplet Chromophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
BODIPY dyes, extensively used as triplet chromophores, have unique electronic structure with strong interactions of spin, electronic and vibrational dynamics. In this experimental and computational study, we explain the control of intersystem crossing of BODIPY triplet chromophores by spin&#8208;vibronic coupling. We rationalize the site&#8208;specific effect of heavy atom substitution by extending El&#8208;Sayed rules beyond their traditional applications.







Abstract
4,4&#8208;Difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;borata&#8208;3a&#8208;azonia&#8208;4a&#8208;aza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene (BODIPY) dyes are extensively used in various applications of their triplet states, ranging from photoredox catalysis, through triplet sensitization to photodynamic therapy. However, the rational design of BODIPY triplet chromophores by ab initio modelling is limited by their strong interactions of spin, electronic and vibrational dynamics. In particular, spin&#8208;vibronic coupling is often overlooked when estimating intersystem crossing (ISC) rates. In this study, a combined experimental and theoretical approach using spin&#8208;vibronic coupling to correctly describe ISC in BODIPY dyes was developed. For this purpose, seven &#960;&#8208;extended BODIPY derivatives with iodine atoms in different positions were examined. It was found that the heavy&#8208;atom effect of iodine atoms is site specific, causing high triplet yields in only some positions. This site&#8208;specific ISC was explained by El&#8208;Sayed rules, so both the contribution and character of the molecular orbitals involved in the excitation must be considered when predicting the ISC rates. Overall, the rational design of BODIPY triplet chromophores requires using (i)&#8197;the high&#8208;quality electronic structure theory, including both static and dynamical correlations; and (ii)&#8197;the two&#8208;component wave function Hamiltonian, and rationalizing; and (iii)&#8197;ISC based on the character of the molecular orbitals of heavy atoms involved in the excitation, expanding El&#8208;Sayed rules beyond their traditional applications.

         <title>Glycerol Oligomerization over Titania&#8208;Based Catalyst Compositions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modification of TiO2 with sulfonic groups causes the appearance of catalytic activity with the formation of a wide range of polyglycerides. Fabrication of a composite of sulfated titania with carbon nanotubes limits the spectrum of products with short&#8208;chain linear glycerides. Thus, it gives a promising way to obtain a selective catalyst for the processing of glycerol into short&#8208;chain polyglycerides.







Abstract
The possibility of using TiO2&#8208;based compositions: individual and sulfated titania, and their composites with carbon nanotubes as catalysts for glycerol oligomerization has been displayed. The effect of modification of TiO2 with sulfur and carbon nanotubes on acid&#8208;base and catalytic characteristics in the glycerol conversion was investigated. The activation of glycerol on the catalysts has been studied using attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR&#8208;FTIR) spectroscopy. Only the samples based on sulfated titania are active over glycerol transformation, showing up to 58.7&#8201;% conversion. This is explained by the presence of strong base sites. Glycerides up to pentaglycerides, both linear and nonlinear structure are formed by glycerol oligomerization over TiO2&#8722;S. The addition of nanotubes to the catalyst reduces both the glycerol conversion (up to 10.5&#8201;%) and the yield of glycerides. However, the spectrum of the resulting products is significantly narrowed, increasing the selectivity for short&#8208;chain glycerides: the portion of diglycerides reaches 72&#8201;%, and triglycerides 21&#8201;%. Herewith, glycerides of a linear structure only formed.

         <title>Robust Spin Liquidity in 2D Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Cu3 (HHTP)2 with S=1/2 Kagome Lattice</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique synthetic approach is implemented to crystallize a Cu(II)&#8208;based 2D MOF, Cu3(HHTP)2 onto reduced graphene oxide (rGO) leading to electron doping via chemical interaction between two sublattices, magnetic and electronic, resulting in the 200&#8208;fold increase in electrical conductivity along with the presence of robust spin liquidity.







Abstract
On one hand electron or hole doping of quantum spin liquid (QSL) may unlock high&#8208;temperature superconductivity and on the other hand it can disrupt the spin liquidity, giving rise to a magnetically ordered ground state. Recently, a 2D MOF, Cu3(HHTP)2 (HHTP &#8208; 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene), containing Cu(II) S=
 frustrated spins in the Kagome lattice is emerging as a promising QSL candidate. Herein, we present an elegant in&#8197;situ redox&#8208;chemistry strategy of anchoring Cu3(HHTP)2 crystallites onto diamagnetic reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets, resulting in the formation of electron&#8208;doped Cu3(HHTP)2&#8208;rGO composite which exhibited a characteristic semiconducting behavior (5&#8197;K to 300&#8197;K) with high electrical conductivity of 70&#8197;S&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;m&#8722;1 and a carrier density of ~1.1&#215;1018&#8197;cm&#8722;3 at 300&#8197;K. Remarkably, no magnetic transition in the Cu3(HHTP)2&#8208;rGO composite was observed down to 1.5&#8197;K endorsing the robust spin liquidity of the 2D MOF Cu3(HHTP)2. Specific heat capacity measurements led to the estimation of the residual entropy values of 28&#8201;% and 34&#8201;% of the theoretically expected value for the pristine Cu3(HHTP)2 and Cu3(HHTP)2&#8208;rGO composite, establishing the presence of strong quantum fluctuations down to 1.5&#8197;K (two times smaller than the value of the exchange interaction J).

         <title>Synthesis and Evaluation of Glycosyl Luciferins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work highlights the synthesis of glycosyl luciferins and their potential for determining glycosidase activity. Two novel synthetic routes were developed that were used to introduce the luciferin moiety in a late&#8208;stage of the sequence and the linear range of the glycosidase assays and kinetics of the substrates were determined.







Abstract
Measuring glycosidase activity is important to monitor any aberrations in carbohydrate hydrolase activity, but also for the screening of potential glycosidase inhibitors. To this end, synthetic substrates are needed which provide an enzyme&#8208;dependent read&#8208;out upon hydrolysis by the glycosidase. Herein, we present two new routes for the synthesis of caged luminescent carbohydrates, which can be used for determining glycosidase activity with a luminescent reporter molecule. The substrates were validated with glycosidase and revealed a clear linear range and enzyme&#8208;dependent signal upon the in&#8197;situ generation of the luciferin moiety from the corresponding nitrile precursors. Besides, we showed that these compounds could directly be synthesized from unprotected glycosyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;fluorides in a two&#8208;step procedure with yields up to 75&#8201;%. The intermediate methyl imidate appeared a key intermediate which also reacted with d&#8208;cysteine to give the corresponding d&#8208;luciferin substrate rendering this a highly attractive method for synthesizing glycosyl luciferins in good yields.

The intermediate methyl imidate appeared a key intermediate which also reacted with &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-cysteine to give the corresponding &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-luciferin substrate rendering this a highly attractive method for synthesizing glycosyl luciferins in good yields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Manganese (I)&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidant&#8208;Controlled Divergent Functionalization of 2&#8208;Arylindazoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we have reported a one&#8208;pot oxidant&#8208;controlled synthesis of C&#8208;2&#8242; formyl 2H&#8208;indazoles, along with two rare heterocycles viz. indazoloindazolediones and indazolobenzoxazines from 2&#8208;arylindazoles through Mn(I)&#8208;catalyzed ortho C&#8722;H functionalization followed by oxidation with varying the amount of DDQ and switching from DDQ to selectfluor, with broad range of substrates scope.







Abstract
The oxidant&#8208;controlled divergent synthesis of C&#8208;2&#8242; formyl 2H&#8208;indazoles and indazoloindazolediones has been developed through Mn(I)&#8208; catalyzed ortho C&#8722;H functionalization of 2H&#8208;indazoles with para&#8208;formaldehyde to afford C&#8208;2&#8242; hydroxymethylated 2H&#8208;indazoles and subsequently oxidation with varying the amount of DDQ in one&#8208;pot. By employing selectfluor as the oxidant instead of DDQ, this reaction exclusively provided indazolebenzoxazine derivatives. This strategy delivered unsymmetrical indazoloindazoledione and indazolobenzoxazine with varied functional group tolerance in moderate to good yields.

         <title>Porous Carbon Foam with Carbon Nanotubes as Cathode for Li&#8722;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous carbon foam with carbon nanotubes were elaborately designed and fabricated by using cobalt as the catalyst and utilized as cathode for Li&#8722;CO2 battery. The unique structure can enhance the decomposition rate of lithium carbonate, and thus improve the electrochemical performance of Li&#8722;CO2 battery.







Abstract
With the extensive use of fossil fuels, the ever&#8208;increasing greenhouse gas of mainly carbon dioxide emissions will result in global climate change. It is of utmost importance to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and its utilization. Li&#8722;CO2 batteries can convert carbon dioxide into electrochemical energy. However, developing efficient catalysts for the decomposition of Li2CO3 as the discharge product represents a challenge in Li&#8722;CO2 batteries. Herein, we demonstrate a carbon foam composite with growing carbon nanotube by using cobalt as the catalyst, showing the ability to enhance the decomposition rate of Li2CO3, and thus improve the electrochemical performance of Li&#8722;CO2 batteries. Benefiting from its abundant pore structure and catalytic sites, the as&#8208;assembled Li&#8722;CO2 battery exhibits a desirable overpotential of 1.67&#8197;V after 50&#8197;cycles. Moreover, the overpotentials are 1.05 and 2.38&#8197;V at current densities of 0.02 and 0.20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. These results provide a new avenue for the development of efficient catalysts for Li&#8722;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Binding Properties of Small Electrophilic Anions [B6X5]&#8722; and [B10X9]&#8722; (X=Cl, Br, I): Activation of Small Molecules Based on &#960;&#8208;Backbonding</title>

         <dc:description>
A special feature of the small metal&#8208;free electrophilic anion [B6X5]&#8722; is nitrogen activation through &#960;&#8208;backbonding. The &#960;&#8208;backbonding predicted by EDA ETS&#8208;NOCV and detected by IR spectroscopy as a red shift of the bound N2 vibrational frequency is shown as a cartoon &#8220;boxing match&#8221; between N2 (blue glove, &#963;&#8208;donation) and [B6Cl5]&#8208; (red gloves, &#960;&#8208;backdonation). The measured spectrum is shown on the outer surface of the boxing ring. Further information, including interaction with CO and H2O and comparison with [B12X11]&#8722;, can be found in the Research Article by J. Warneke and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302247).

         <title>Reductive Release from a Hybrid PKS&#8208;NRPS during the Biosynthesis of Pyrichalasin H</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reductive release of cytochalasin intermediates was studied in&#8197;vitro, showing that the R&#8208;domain requires a T&#8208;domain tethered substrate, but has low selectivity for the amino acid and polyketide moieties. Direct 2&#8208;electron reduction is the preferred mode of release, followed by rapid Knoevenagel cyclisation of the released aldehyde.







Abstract
Three central steps during the biosynthesis of cytochalasan precursors, including reductive release, Knoevenagel cyclisation and Diels Alder cyclisation are not yet understood at a detailed molecular level. In this work we investigated the reductive release step catalysed by a hybrid polyketide synthase non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS&#8208;NRPS) from the pyrichalasin H pathway. Synthetic thiolesters were used as substrate mimics for in&#8197;vitro studies with the isolated reduction (R) and holo&#8208;thiolation (T) domains of the PKS&#8208;NRPS hybrid PyiS. These assays demonstrate that the PyiS R&#8208;domain mainly catalyses an NADPH&#8208;dependent reductive release of an aldehyde intermediate that quickly undergoes spontaneous Knoevenagel cyclisation. The R&#8208;domain can only process substrates that are covalently bound to the phosphopantetheine thiol of the upstream T&#8208;domain, but it shows little selectivity for the polyketide.
