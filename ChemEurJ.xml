         <title>Fluorinated Rings: Conformation and Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of fluorine atoms into molecules and materials across many fields of academic and industrial research is now commonplace, owing to their unique properties and effects. A particularly interesting feature of fluorine substitution is its impact on the relative orientation of a C&#8211;F bond when incorporated with organic molecules. In this Review, we will be shining light on this unique feature by discussing the conformational behaviour of aliphatic carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic systems. The conformational preference of each system is associated with various interactions introduced by fluorine substitution such as charge&#8208;dipole interactions, dipole&#8208;dipole interactions and hyperconjugative interactions. The contribution of each interaction on the stabilization of the fluorinated alicyclic system, which manifests itself in low conformations, will be discussed in details. The novelty of this feature will be demonstrated by presenting the most recent applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Do docking sites persist upon fluorination? The diadamantyl ether&#8208;aromatics challenge for rotational spectroscopy and theory</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorinated derivatives of biological molecules have proved to be highly efficient at modifying the biological activity of a given protein through changes in the stability and the kind of docking interactions. These interactions can be hindered or facilitated based on the hydrophilic/hydrophobic character of a particular protein region. Diadamantyl ether ( C 20 H 30 O ) possesses both kinds of docking sites, serving as a good template to model these important contacts with aromatic fluorinated counterparts. We report here an experimental study on the structures of several complexes between diadamantyl ether and benzene as well as a series of fluorinated benzenes to analyze the effect of H &#8594; F substitution on the interaction and structure of the resulting molecular clusters using rotational spectroscopy. All experimentally observed complexes are largely dominated by London dispersion interactions with the hydrogen&#8208;terminated surface areas of diadamantyl ether. Already single substitution of one hydrogen atom with fluorine changes the preferred docking site of the complexes. However, the overall contributions of the different intermolecular interactions are similar for the different complexes, contrary to previous studies focusing on the difference in interactions using fluorinated and non&#8208;fluorinated molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>How Does Bridging Core Modification Alter the Photovoltaic Characteristics of Triphenylamine&#8208;Based Hole Transport Materials? Theoretical Understanding and Prediction</title>

Perovskite solar cells: Advanced quantum chemical techniques are employed to explore the photophysical, photovoltaic, and optoelectronic properties as well as the structure&#8211;property relationship of R and HB1&#8211;HB10 molecules. The studied systems may be targeted for the development of high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
Perovskite solar cells have gained immense interest from researchers owing to their good photophysical properties, low&#8208;cost production, and high power conversion efficiencies. Hole transport materials (HTMs) play a dominant role in enhancing the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and long diffusion length of holes and electrons in perovskite solar cells. In hole transport materials, modification of &#960;&#8208;linkers has proved to be an efficient approach for enhancing the overall PCE of perovskite solar cells. In this work, &#960;&#8208;linker modification of a recently synthesized H&#8722;Bi molecule (R) is achieved with novel &#960;&#8208;linkers. After structural modifications, ten novel HTMs (HB1&#8211;HB10) with a D&#8722;&#960;&#8722;D backbone are obtained. The structure&#8211;property relationship, and optoelectronic and photovoltaic characteristics of these newly designed hole transport materials are examined comprehensively and compared with reference molecules. In addition, different geometric parameters are also examined with the assistance of density functional theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT. All the designed molecules exhibit narrow HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gaps (Eg=2.82&#8211;2.99&#8197;eV) compared with the R molecule (Eg=3.05&#8197;eV). The designed molecules express redshifting in their absorption spectra with low values of excitation energy, which in return offer high power conversion efficiencies. Further, density of states and molecular electrostatic potential analysis is performed to locate the different charge sites in the molecules. The reorganizational energies of holes and electrons are found to have good values, suggesting that these novel designed molecules are efficient hole transport materials for perovskite solar cells. In addition, the low binding energy values of the designed molecules (compared with R) offer high current charge density. Finally, complex study of HB9:PC61BM is also undertaken to understand the charge transfer between the molecules of the complex. The results of all analyses advocate that these novel designed HTMs are promising candidates for the construction of future high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells.

         <title>A High&#8208;Efficiency Hematite Photoanode with Enhanced Bonding Energy Around Fe Atoms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hematite photoanodes: By treating the surface of hematite with Se and NaBH4, the Fe2O3 is transformed into a double&#8208;layer nanostructure. In the outer layer, the Fe&#8722;O bonding is reinforced and the Fe&#8722;Se bonding is even stronger. Therefore, the surface states are inhibited and the increase in photocurrent density becomes much faster.







Abstract
Hematite nanoarrays are important photoanode materials. However, they suffer from serious problems of charge transfer and surface states; in particular, the surface states hinder the increase in photocurrent. A previous strategy to suppress the surface state is the deposition of an Fe&#8208;free metal oxide overlayer. Herein, from the viewpoint of atomic bonding energy, it is found that the strength of bonding around Fe atoms in the hematite is the key to suppressing the surface states.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hematite photoanodes&lt;/b&gt;: By treating the surface of hematite with Se and NaBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, the Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is transformed into a double&#8208;layer nanostructure. In the outer layer, the Fe&#8722;O bonding is reinforced and the Fe&#8722;Se bonding is even stronger. Therefore, the surface states are inhibited and the increase in photocurrent density becomes much faster.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hematite nanoarrays are important photoanode materials. However, they suffer from serious problems of charge transfer and surface states; in particular, the surface states hinder the increase in photocurrent. A previous strategy to suppress the surface state is the deposition of an Fe&#8208;free metal oxide overlayer. Herein, from the viewpoint of atomic bonding energy, it is found that the strength of bonding around Fe atoms in the hematite is the key to suppressing the surface states. By treating the surface of hematite with Se and NaBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, the Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; transforms to a double&#8208;layer nanostructure. In the outer layer, the Fe&#8722;O bonding is reinforced and the Fe&#8722;Se bonding is even stronger. Therefore, the surface states are inhibited and the increase in the photocurrent density becomes much faster. Besides, the treatment constructs a nanoscale p&#8211;n junction to promote the charge transfer. Improvements are achieved in onset potential (0.25&#8197;V shift) and in photocurrent density (5.8&#8197;times). This work pinpoints the key to suppressing the surface states and preparing a high&#8208;efficiency hematite nanoarray, and deepens our understanding of hematite photoanodes.&lt;/p&gt;

An efficient approach to the type&#8197;III lepadin alkaloids (lepadins F and G) has been developed through a key Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, in which a novel ketolactone&#8208;type dienophile with a chiral unit is employed to generate the desirable all&#8208;cis&#8208;trisubstituted cyclohexene with complete regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity control. By using this approach, (&#8722;)&#8208;lepadin F is synthesized for the first time.







Abstract
An efficient approach to the type&#8197;III lepadin alkaloids (lepadins F and G) has been developed through a key Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, in which a novel ketolactone&#8208;type dienophile with chiral diol unit is employed to generate the desirable all&#8208;cis&#8208;trisubstituted cyclohexene with excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity control. The subsequent selective sulfonylation of the diol unit followed by SN2 cyclization under hydrogenation conditions could construct the substituted piperidine ring. By using this approach, (&#8722;)&#8208;lepadin F is synthesized from ethyl l&#8208;lactate for the first time.

         <title>Air Stable Iridium Catalysts for Direct Reductive Amination of Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Half&#8208;sandwich iridium complexes bearing bidentate urea&#8208;phosphorus ligands were found to catalyze the direct reductive amination of aromatic and aliphatic ketones under mild conditions at 0.5 mol.% loading with high selectivity towards primary amines. One of the complexes was found to be active in both the Leuckart&#8208;Wallach (NH4CO2H) type reaction as well as in the hydrogenative (H2/NH4AcO) reductive amination. The protocol with ammonium formate does not require an inert atmosphere, dry solvents, as well as additives and in contrast to previous reports takes place in HFIP instead of methanol. Applying NH4CO2D or D2 resulted in a high degree of deuterium incorporation into the primary amine &#945;&#8208;position.</dc:description>

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Bridge Substitution in DASAs: The Subtle Equilibrium between Photochemical Improvements and Thermal Control**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bridging the gap: A new set of donor&#8211;acceptor Stenhouse adducts was computationally studied and prepared through the substitution on the &#960;&#8208;bridge. This allows for the modification of absorption, photocyclization, and relative stability of the isomers. This change provides a consistent redshift in the absorption maximum and a structural entry point for subsequent derivatization, although the reversibility is blocked.







Abstract
Donor&#8211;acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASAs) are playing an outstanding role as innovative and versatile photoswitches. Until now, all the efforts have been spent on modifying the donor and acceptor moieties to modulate the absorption energy and improve the cyclization and reversion kinetics. However, there is a strong dependence on specific structural modifications and a lack of predictive behavior, mostly owing to the complex photoswitching mechanism. Here, by means of a combined experimental and theoretical study, the effect of chemical modification of the &#960;&#8208;bridge linking the donor and acceptor moieties is systematically explored, revealing the significant impact on the absorption, photocyclization, and relative stability of the open form. In particular, a position along the &#960;&#8208;bridge is found to be the most suited to redshift the absorption while preserving the cyclization. However, thermal back&#8208;reaction to the initial isomer is blocked. These effects are explained in terms of an increased acceptor capability offered by the &#960;&#8208;bridge substituent that can be modulated. This strategy opens the path toward derivatives with infra&#8208;red absorption and a potential anchoring point for further functionalization.

         <title>Boron&#8211;Ligand Cooperation: The Concept and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
B for cooperation: The term boron&#8211;ligand cooperation (BLC) describes a specific mode of action by which distinctive intramolecular borane&#8208;based frustrated Lewis Pairs (FLPs) activate chemical bonds. The central aspect of this concept is that the substituent at the borane that is involved in the bond activation becomes a datively bound ligand upon bond activation. The reactivity of systems that operate via BLC can complement those of classic intramolecular FLPs.







Abstract
The term boron&#8211;ligand cooperation was introduced to describe a specific mode of action by which certain metal&#8208;free systems activate chemical bonds. The main characteristic of this mode of action is that one covalently bound substituent at the boron is actively involved in the bond activation process and changes to a datively bound ligand in the course of the bond activation. Within this review, how the term boron&#8211;ligand cooperation evolved is reflected on and examples of bond activation by boron&#8211;ligand cooperation are discussed. It is furthermore shown that systems that operate via boron&#8211;ligand cooperation can complement the reactivity of classic intramolecular frustrated Lewis pairs and applications of this new concept for metal&#8208;free catalysis are summarized.

         <title>Combined Ex and In Situ Measurements Elucidate the Dynamics of Retained Species in ZSM&#8208;5 and SAPO&#8208;18 Catalysts Used in the Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Olefins Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
The methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefins (MTO) reaction generates many retained species in the catalyst that evolve from active species for the formation of olefins to deactivating species leaving coke deposits. The active species can be detected by a combination of ex situ temperature&#8208;programmed desorption (TPD) and extraction measurements whereas the deactivating species by ex situ temperature&#8208;programmed oxidation (TPO), and both of them by in situ FTIR spectroscopy, which allows their dynamics to be followed in the MTO reaction performance.







Abstract
The dynamics of the retained species on ZSM&#8208;5 and SAPO&#8208;18 catalysts are studied by using a combination of temperature&#8208;programmed desorption/oxidation, ex situ analysis, and in situ FTIR spectroscopic measurements over the entire conversion range, using fixed&#8208;bed and spectroscopic cell reactors, in continuous and discontinuous mode. The results point to the appropriateness of the combined methodologies to track the interconversion of active into deactivating species. A statistically relevant (supported by linear regression and multivariate analysis) association of the observations is found by using the different complementary methodologies. The kinetics of this interconversion depends on the initial conversion (tuned by acidity and space time) and microporous topology, and involve: (i)&#8197;in the ZSM&#8208;5 catalysts, the diffusion of monocyclic aromatics toward the exterior of the zeolite to form coke, and (ii)&#8197;in the SAPO&#8208;18 catalysts, the obstruction of the cavities by aromatics that grow into tetracyclic aromatic islands.

         <title>Controlling Spin&#8208;Correlated Radical Pairs with Donor&#8211;Acceptor Dyads: A New Concept to Generate Reduced Metal Complexes for More Efficient Photocatalysis</title>

Ping&#8208;pong with electrons: Employing time&#8208;resolved optical spectroscopy, a new concept for the light&#8208;driven generation of reduced metal complexes with important implications for photocatalysis is presented.







Abstract
One&#8208;electron reduced metal complexes derived from photoactive ruthenium or iridium complexes are important intermediates for substrate activation steps in photoredox catalysis and for the photocatalytic generation of solar fuels. However, owing to the heavy atom effect, direct photochemical pathways to these key intermediates suffer from intrinsic efficiency problems resulting from rapid geminate recombination of radical pairs within the so&#8208;called solvent cage. In this study, we prepared and investigated molecular dyads capable of producing reduced metal complexes via an indirect pathway relying on a sequence of energy and electron transfer processes between a Ru complex and a covalently connected anthracene moiety. Our test reaction to establish the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept is the photochemical reduction of ruthenium(tris)bipyridine by the ascorbate dianion as sacrificial donor in aqueous solution. The photochemical key step in the Ru&#8208;anthracene dyads is the reduction of a purely organic (anthracene) triplet excited state by the ascorbate dianion, yielding a spin&#8208;correlated radical pair whose (unproductive) recombination is strongly spin&#8208;forbidden. By carrying out detailed laser flash photolysis investigations, we provide clear evidence for the indirect reduced metal complex generation mechanism and show that this pathway can outperform the conventional direct metal complex photoreduction. The further optimization of our approach involving relatively simple molecular dyads might result in novel photocatalysts that convert substrates with unprecedented quantum yields.

         <title>Mechanical Modulation of the Solid&#8208;State Luminescence of Tricarbonyl Rhenium(I) Complexes through the Interplay between Two Triplet Excited States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Totally unprecedented! The link between mechanoresponsive luminescence (MRL) and solid&#8208;state luminescence enhancement has been explored for two ReI complexes. Remarkably, mechanical stimulation modulates the emission of two low&#8208;lying triplet states and opens vibrational modes through the disruption of the rigid crystal structure upon grinding (see figure). This report reveals the unprecedented potential of ReI complexes as MRL&#8208;active materials.







Abstract
Mechanoresponsive luminescence (MRL) materials promise smart devices for sensing, optoelectronics and security. We present here the first report on the MRL activity of two ReI complexes, opening up new opportunities for applications in these fields. Both complexes exhibit marked solid&#8208;state luminescence enhancement (SLE). Furthermore, the pristine microcrystalline powders emit in the yellow&#8208;green region, and grinding led to an amorphous phase with concomitant emission redshift and shrinking of the photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields and lifetimes. Quantum chemical calculations revealed the existence of two low&#8208;lying triplet excited states with very similar energy levels, that is, 3IL and 3MLCT, having, respectively, almost pure intraligand (IL) and metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer (MLCT) character. Transition between these states could be promoted by rotation around the pyridyltriazole&#8722;phenylbenzoxazole bond. In the microcrystals, in which rotations are hindered, the 3IL state induces the prominent PL emission at short wavelengths. Upon grinding, rotation is facilitated and the transition to the 3MLCT state results in a larger proportion of long&#8208;wavelength PL. FTIR and variable&#8208;temperature PL spectroscopy showed that the opening of the vibrational modes favours non&#8208;radiative deactivation of the triplet states in the amorphous phase. In solution, PL only arises from the 3MLCT state. The same mechanism accounts for the spectroscopic differences observed when passing from crystals to amorphous powders, and then to solutions, thereby clarifying the link between SLE and MRL for these complexes.

         <title>Fluorescent Imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrimidine Compounds as Biocompatible Organic Photosensitizers that Generate Singlet Oxygen: A Potential Tool for Phototheranostics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New phototheranostics! Imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrimidine compounds are able to generate singlet oxygen species and act as photosensitizers in the intracellular environment (see figure). They exhibit all the properties of an ideal photosensitizer, required for simultaneous fluorescence imaging and photodynamic activity, and as such they have potential for phototheranostics.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy has been used to treat a variety of diseases, however, there is continuing search for new biocompatible photosensitizers. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrimidine compounds are able to generate singlet oxygen species and can act as photosensitizers in the intracellular environment. Our results show that this class of compounds absorb and emit in the 400&#8211;500&#8197;nm region, present low cytotoxicity in the dark, are efficiently uptaken by cells, are fluorescent in intracellular medium, and generate singlet oxygen upon irradiation, killing cancer cells within 2&#8197;h at low concentration (2.0&#8197;&#956;m). The imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrimidine compounds are a potential new tool for phototheranostics, because they can be simultaneously used for fluorescence imaging and photodynamic therapy.

         <title>Exploring the Reactivity of a Frustrated Sn/P Lewis Pair: The Highly Selective Complexation of the cis&#8208;Azobenzene Photoisomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly selective complexation of cis&#8208;azobenzene was found when reacting the isomeric compound with the intramolecular frustrated Lewis pair (F5C2)3SnCH2P(tBu)2 under UV&#8208;induced photoisomerization conditions.







Abstract
The reactivity of the geminal frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) (F5C2)3SnCH2P(tBu)2 (1) was explored by reacting it with a variety of small molecules (PhOCN, PhNCS, PhCCH, tBuCCH, H3CC(O)CH=CH2, Ph[C(O)]2Ph, PhN=NPh and Me3SiCHN2), featuring polar or non&#8208;polar multiple bonds and/or represent &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated systems. While most adducts are formed readily, the binding of azobenzene requires UV&#8208;induced photoisomerization, which results in the highly selective complexation of cis&#8208;azobenzene. In the case of benzil, the reaction does not lead to the expected 1,2&#8208; or 1,4&#8208;addition products, but to the non&#8208;stereoselective (tBu)2PCH2&#8208;transfer to a prochiral keto function of benzil. All adducts of 1 were characterised by means of multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, elemental analyses and X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments.

         <title>Photoinduced Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Dicarbofunctionalization of Terminal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dicarbofunctionalization of alkynes at room temperature is achieved using simple, bench&#8208;stable alkyl iodides and a second molecule of alkyne as coupling partner. This alkylation&#8211;alkynylation sequence allows the one&#8208;step synthesis of 1,3&#8208;enynes including heteroarenes and biologically active compounds with high efficiency without exogenous photosensitizers or oxidants.







Abstract

         <title>Towards Catalytically Active Porous Graphene Membranes with Pulsed Laser Deposited Ceria Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous graphene with catalytically active ceria nanometre&#8208;size particles were prepared using pulsed laser deposition on graphene. Increased dehydrogenation activity of methanol leading to CO and H2 formation was demonstrated.







Abstract
Porous graphene with catalytically active ceria nanometre&#8208;size particles were prepared using pulsed laser deposition (PLD) on graphene produced through chemical vapour deposition (CVD). The reported process provided porous graphene containing ceria nanoparticles as confirmed by HR TEM and XPS. Isotopically labelled 13C graphene was employed to study desorption of the species containing carbon. Methanol adsorption was utilised to probe the nature of the catalytic activity of prepared ceria decorated graphene. The important role of graphene support for the stabilization of reduced ceria nanoparticles was finally confirmed. Increased dehydrogenation activity of graphene with ceria nanoparticles leading to CO and H2 formation was demonstrated.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Open and shut with silver! A silver&#8208;promoted fluorine substitution reaction of &#945;&#8208;bromoamide has been recently developed. This methodology enables access to tertiary, secondary, and primary alkyl fluorides with chemoselectivity and stereospecificity by forming an aziridinone intermediate. The cover image depicts that molecules are closed, and opening like an umbrella. In addition, the reaction of &#945;&#8208;bromoamide with O&#8208;nucleophiles including OCF3 provided the sterically hindered alcohol, ester and ether.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Two Uranyl&#8208;Aryl &#8220;Ate&#8221; Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first structurally&#8208;characterized uranyl aryl complexes are reported in this work. A combined 13C NMR spectroscopic and relativistic DFT computational analysis reveals that the chemical shifts of the aryl ipso carbon nuclei are shifted downfield by 62 to 68&#8197;ppm due to high levels of 5f orbital participation in the U&#8722;C bonds. Significantly, this study showcases the exquisite sensitivity of 13C chemical shifts to 5f participation in An&#8722;C bonding, further cementing the utility of this emerging method of analysis.

         <dc:description>
Ladies and gentlemen! Unique structural motifs of simple RZnOR&#8217; alkoxides, a roof&#8208;like trimer and a ladder&#8208;type tetramer, are presented to the broad audience of chemists. Moreover, we show that when our &#8242;chemical performance&#8242; is undertaken in solution, organozinc alkoxides undergo Schlenk&#8208;type ligand redistribution processes, providing the trinuclear spiro&#8208;type compounds. The announced results thus make sure that this long&#8208;standing organometallic show is continuously going on. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J. Lewi&#324;ski et&#8197;al.

         <title>Doubling F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer Efficiency in Proteins with Extrinsic Thioamide Probes: Implications for Thiomodified Nucleobases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
FRET over sulfur! Introducing a small thio&#8208;modified extrinsic probe into an albumin protein results in a twofold enhancement of the FRET efficiency. Donor&#8211;acceptor spectral overlap with stabilization of the probe through different types of noncovalent interactions with sulfur plays a leading role in the unexpected photophysical properties of the thioamide probes.







Abstract
Designing a potential protein&#8211;ligand pair is pivotal, not only to track the protein structure dynamics, but also to assist in an atomistic understanding of drug delivery. Herein, the potential of a small model thioamide probe being used to study albumin proteins is reported. By monitoring the F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) dynamics with the help of fluorescence spectroscopic techniques, a twofold enhancement in the FRET efficiency of 2&#8208;thiopyridone (2TPY), relative to that of its amide analogue, is observed. Molecular dynamics simulations depict the relative position of the free energy minimum to be quite stable in the case of 2TPY through noncovalent interactions with sulfur, which help to enhance the FRET efficiency. Finally, its application is shown by pairing thiouracils with protein. It is found that the site&#8208;selective sulfur atom substitution approach and noncovalent interactions with sulfur can substantially enhance the FRET efficiency, which could be a potential avenue to explore in the design of FRET probes to study the structure and dynamics of biomolecules.

Molecular dynamics simulations depict the relative position of the free energy minimum to be quite stable in the case of 2TPY through noncovalent interactions with sulfur, which help to enhance the FRET efficiency. Finally, its application is shown by pairing thiouracils with protein. It is found that the site&#8208;selective sulfur atom substitution approach and noncovalent interactions with sulfur can substantially enhance the FRET efficiency, which could be a potential avenue to explore in the design of FRET probes to study the structure and dynamics of biomolecules.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Emerging Implications of the Concept of Hydricity in Energy&#8208;Relevant Catalytic Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Back to the drawing board: Thermodynamic hydricity serves as an important conceptual tool in developing key catalyst design principles for various hydride&#8208;transfer reactions. Controlling factors such as solvent, metal identity, and ligand structure play a significant role in manipulating the thermodynamic hydricity of transition&#8208;metal complexes. These important aspects are discussed in the context of optimizing energy&#8208;relevant processes, such as H+ and CO2 reduction to H2 and formate, respectively.







Abstract
The &#8220;hydricity&#8221; of a species refers to its hydride&#8208;donor ability. Similar to how the pKa is useful for determining the extent of dissociation of an acid, the hydricity plays a vital role in understanding hydride&#8208;transfer reactions. A large number of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed processes involve the hydride&#8208;transfer reaction as a key step. Among these, two key reactions&#8212;proton reduction to evolve H2 and hydride transfer to CO2 to generate formate/formic acid&#8212;represent a promising solution to build a sustainable and fossil&#8208;fuel&#8208;free energy economy. Therefore, it is imperative to develop an in&#8208;depth relationship between the hydricity of transition&#8208;metal hydrides and its influencing factors, so that efficient and suitable hydride&#8208;transfer catalysts can be designed. Moreover, such profound knowledge can also help in improving existing catalysts, in terms of their efficiency and working mechanism. With this broad aim in mind, some important research has been explored in this area in recent times. This Minireview emphasizes the conceptual approaches developed thus far, to tune and apply the hydricity parameter of transition&#8208;metal hydrides for efficient H2 evolution and CO2 reduction/hydrogenation catalysis focusing on the guiding principles for future research in this direction.

         <title>Unravelling Structural Mysteries of Simple Organozinc Alkoxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ladder to the roof: The synthesis and structural characterization of two unprecedented zinc alkoxides, a roof&#8208;like trimer [(tBuZn)3(&#956;&#8208;OC(H)Ph2)2(&#956;3&#8208;OC(H)Ph2)] and a ladder&#8208;type tetramer [(PhZn)4(&#956;&#8208;OC(H)Ph2)2(&#956;3&#8208;OC(H)Ph2)2] is described. The solution behavior of the new RZnOR&#8217; alkoxides was also investigated by using 1H&#8197;NMR and DOSY spectroscopy, which revealed the presence of multiple aggregate states involved in the Schlenk&#8208;type equilibria.







Abstract
Simple RZnOR&#8217; alkoxides are among the first known organozinc compounds, and widespread interest in their multifaced chemistry has been driven by their fundamental significance and potential applications including various catalytic reactions. Nevertheless, their chemistry in solution and in the solid state remains both relatively poorly understood and a subject of constant debate. Herein, the synthesis and structural characterization of long&#8208;sought structural forms, a roof&#8208;like trimer [(tBuZn)3(&#956;&#8208;OC(H)Ph2)2(&#956;3&#8208;OC(H)Ph2)] and a ladder&#8208;type tetramer [(PhZn)4(&#956;&#8208;OC(H)Ph2)2(&#956;3&#8208;OC(H)Ph2)2], incorporating diphenylmethanolate as a model alkoxide ligand, are reported. Both novel aggregates are robust in the solid state and resistant towards mechanical force. By using 1H&#8197;NMR and diffusion&#8208;order spectroscopy, it is demonstrated that new RZnOR&#8217; alkoxides are kinetically labile in solution and readily undergo ligand scrambling, such as in the case of Schlenk equilibrium. The elucidated key structural issues, which have remained undiscovered for decades, significantly advance the chemistry of RZnOR&#8217; alkoxides and should support the rational design of zinc alkoxide&#8208;based applications.

         <title>Facile Access to Hetero&#8208;poly&#8208;functional Arenes and meta&#8208;Substituted Arenes via Two&#8208;Step Dimetalation and Mg/Halogen&#8208;Exchange Protocol</title>

A tandem template metalation and Mg/I&#8208;exchange strategy has been used to convert simple arenes into the corresponding meta&#8208;substituted arenes in good yields.







Abstract
The Grignard reagent, iPrMgCl and its lithium chloride&#8208;enhanced &#8216;turbo&#8217; derivative iPrMgCl&#8901;LiCl have been employed to investigate the single iodo/magnesium exchange reactions of the trisubstituted arenes, 2,5&#8208;diiodo&#8208;N,N&#8208;diisopropylbenzamide 1, 1,4&#8208;diiodo&#8208;2&#8208;methoxybenzene 2, and 1,4&#8208;diiodo&#8208;2&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)benzene 3. These three arenes themselves were initially prepared by a double ortho&#8208;, meta&#8242;&#8208;deprotonation of N,N&#8208;diisopropylbenzamide, anisole and (trifluoromethyl)benzene, respectively, using the sodium magnesiate reagent [Na4Mg2(TMP)6(nBu)2] (where TMP is 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidide), and subsequent electrophilic quenching with iodine/THF solution. Thus, by following a combined deprotonation and magnesium/halogen exchange strategy, the simple monosubstituted arenes can be converted to trisubstituted diiodoarenes, which can ultimately be transformed into the corresponding mono&#8208;magnesiated arenes, in THF at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, within seconds in good yields. The other functional group (OMe, NiPr2 or CF3 respectively) present on the di&#8208;iodoarenes helps direct the exchange reaction to the ortho position, whereas subsequent addition of different electrophiles permits the preparation of hetero&#8208;poly&#8208;functional&#8208;arenes, with three different substituents in their structure. Intriguingly, if water is used as the electrophile, a new and facile route to prepare meta&#8208;substituted arenes, which cannot be easily obtained by conventional processes, is forthcoming. In contrast to directed ortho&#8208;metalation (DoM) chemistry, this reaction sequence can be thought of as InDirect meta&#8208;Metalation (IDmM). The scope of the chemistry has been tested further by exposing the initial unreacted iodo&#8208;functionality at the meta&#8208;position to a second Mg/I&#8208;exchange reaction and subsequent functionalization.

         <title>Benzo&#8208;Tetrathiafulvalene&#8208; (BTTF&#8208;) Annulated Expanded Porphyrins: Potential Next&#8208;Generation Multielectron Reservoirs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Expanded porphyrins: Two new benzo&#8208;TTF&#8208;annulated expanded porphyrins show effective intramolecular charge transfer (CT) transitions from TTF moieties to the macrocyclic core. Electrochemical investigations reveal that these electron&#8208;rich materials could be used as efficient electron reservoirs for material applications.







Abstract
Two sterically crowded benzo&#8208;tetrathiafulvalene (BTTF)&#8208;annulated expanded porphyrins (BTTF7&#8208;F and BTTF8) are synthesized. Detailed photophysical investigations reveal their intrinsic intramolecular charge transfer (CT) character, originated from partial electron transfer from electron&#8208;rich TTF units to the relatively electron&#8208;deficient macrocyclic core. This finding stands in contrast to what was observed in the previously reported Figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight conformer of BTTF&#8208;annulated [28]hexaphyrin (BTTF6), in which a typical &#960;&#8211;&#960;* electronic transition from HOMO to LUMO was observed. However, core expansion in BTTF7&#8208;F and BTTF8 makes the oligopyrrole macrocyclic cores relatively more electron&#8208;deficient, facilitating the effective intramolecular CT process. Comparative electrochemical investigations reveal that the current generated at the oxidative region is directly proportional to the number of TTF units attached to the macrocyclic core. This work demonstrates the control of the intramolecular CT process through incremental addition of TTF units to the macrocyclic core. Facile multielectron electrochemical oxidations of these expanded porphyrins suggest that they behave like potential multielectron reservoirs.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Expanded porphyrins&lt;/b&gt;: Two new benzo&#8208;TTF&#8208;annulated expanded porphyrins show effective intramolecular charge transfer (CT) transitions from TTF moieties to the macrocyclic core. Electrochemical investigations reveal that these electron&#8208;rich materials could be used as efficient electron reservoirs for material applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two sterically crowded benzo&#8208;tetrathiafulvalene (BTTF)&#8208;annulated expanded porphyrins (&lt;b&gt;BTTF7&#8208;F&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;BTTF8&lt;/b&gt;) are synthesized. Detailed photophysical investigations reveal their intrinsic intramolecular charge transfer (CT) character, originated from partial electron transfer from electron&#8208;rich TTF units to the relatively electron&#8208;deficient macrocyclic core. This finding stands in contrast to what was observed in the previously reported &lt;i&gt;Figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight&lt;/i&gt; conformer of BTTF&#8208;annulated [28]hexaphyrin (&lt;b&gt;BTTF6&lt;/b&gt;), in which a typical &#960;&#8211;&#960;* electronic transition from HOMO to LUMO was observed. However, core expansion in &lt;b&gt;BTTF7&#8208;F&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;BTTF8&lt;/b&gt; makes the oligopyrrole macrocyclic cores relatively more electron&#8208;deficient, facilitating the effective intramolecular CT process. Comparative electrochemical investigations reveal that the current generated at the oxidative region is directly proportional to the number of TTF units attached to the macrocyclic core. This work demonstrates the control of the intramolecular CT process through incremental addition of TTF units to the macrocyclic core. Facile multielectron electrochemical oxidations of these expanded porphyrins suggest that they behave like potential multielectron reservoirs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Chemical Bonding as a New Avenue for Controlling Excited&#8208;State Properties and Excitation Energy&#8208;Transfer Processes in Zinc Phthalocyanine&#8211;Fullerene Dyads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two compounds, two natures: Electronic structure and nonadiabatic dynamics methods were used to explore the excited&#8208;state properties of two zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc)&#8208;fullerene dyads. In one bonding configuration, excitation energy transfer from ZnPc to C60 is inhibited; in the other, this process is thermodynamically favorable, with locally excited and charge&#8208;transfer excitons being shown to participate in the energy&#8208;transfer process.







Abstract
Whether chemical bonding can regulate the excited&#8208;state and optoelectronic properties of donor&#8211;acceptor dyads has been largely elusive. In this work, we used electronic structure and nonadiabatic dynamics methods to explore the excited&#8208;state properties of covalently bonded zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc)&#8208;fullerene (C60) dyads with a 6&#8211;6 (or 5&#8211;6) bonding configuration in which ZnPc is bonded to two carbon atoms shared by the two hexagonal rings (or a pentagonal and a hexagonal ring) in C60. In both cases, the locally excited (LE) states on ZnPc are spectroscopically bright. However, their different chemical bonding differentiates the electronic interactions between ZnPc and C60. In the 5&#8211;6 bonding configuration, the LE states on ZnPc are much higher in energy than the LE states on C60. Thus, the excitation energy transfer from ZnPc to C60 is thermodynamically favorable. On the other hand, in the 6&#8211;6 bonding configuration, such a process is inhibited because the LE states on ZnPc are the lowest ones. More detailed mechanisms are elucidated from nonadiabatic dynamics simulations. In the 6&#8211;6 bonding configuration, no excitation energy transfer was observed. In contrast, in the 5&#8211;6 bonding configuration, several LE and charge&#8208;transfer (CT) excitons were shown to participate in the energy&#8208;transfer process. Further analysis reveals that the photoinduced energy transfer is mediated by a CT exciton, such that electron&#8208; and hole&#8208;transfer processes take place in a concerted but asynchronous manner in the excitation energy transfer. It is also found that high&#8208;level electronic structure methods including exciton effects are indispensable to accurately describe photoinduced energy&#8208; and electron&#8208;transfer processes. Furthermore, this work opens up new avenues for regulating the excited&#8208;state properties of molecular donor&#8211;acceptor dyads by means of chemical bonding.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling Reactions of CO2 with C2H4 and Hydrosilanes towards Silyl Esters</title>

Reductive carboxylation of ethylene in the presence of triethylsilane as reductant is achieved upon using in situ&#8208;prepared catalytic systems incorporating RuII precursors and bidentate phosphine ligands.







Abstract
A series of in situ&#8208;prepared catalytic systems incorporating RuII precursors and bidentate phosphine ligands has been probed in the reductive carboxylation of ethylene in the presence of triethylsilane as reductant. The catalytic production of propionate and acrylate silyl esters was evidenced by high&#8208;throughput screening (HTS) and implemented in batch reactor techniques. The most promising catalyst systems identified were made of Ru(H)(Cl)(CO)(PPh3)3 and 1,4&#8208;bis(dicyclohexylphosphino)butane (DCPB) or 1,1&#8217;&#8208;ferrocene&#8208;diyl&#8208;bis(cyclohexylphosphine) (DCPF). A marked influence of water on the acrylate/propionate selectivity was noted. Turnover numbers [mol&#8201;mol(Ru)&#8722;1] up to 16 for acrylate and up to 68 for propionate were reached under relatively mild conditions (20&#8197;bar, 100&#8201;&#176;C, 0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;% Ru, 40&#8197;mol&#8201;% H2O vs. HSiEt3). Possible mechanisms are discussed.

         <title>Unveiling the Uncommon Fluorescent Recognition Mechanism Towards Pertechnetate Using a Cationic Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Bearing N&#8208;heterocyclic AIE Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As one of most problematic radionuclides, technetium&#8208;99, mainly in the form of anionic pertechnetate (TcO4&#8208;), exhibits high environmental mobility, long half&#8208;life and radioactive hazard. Due to low charge density and high hydrophobicity for this tetrahedral anion, it is extremely difficult to recognize it in water. Seeking efficient and selective recognition method for TcO4&#8208; is still a big challenge. Herein, we reported a new water&#8208;stable cationic metal&#8208;organic framework (ZJU&#8208;X8) bearing tetraphenylethylene pyrimidine&#8208;based aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) ligands and attainable silver sites for TcO4&#8208; detection. ZJU&#8208;X8 underwent an obvious spectroscopic change from brilliant blue to flavovirens and exhibited splendid selectivity towards TcO4&#8208;. Such uncommon fluorescent recognition mechanism was well elucidated by the batch sorption experiments and density functional theoretical (DFT) calculations. It is found that only TcO4&#8208; could enter into the body of ZJU&#8208;X8 through anion exchange whereas other competing anions were excluded outside. Subsequently, after interaction between TcO4&#8208; and silver ions, the electron polarizations from pyrimidine rings to Ag+ cations significantly lowered the energy level of the &#960;* orbital and thus reduced the &#960;&#8208;&#960;* energy gap, resulting in a red&#8208;shift in the fluorescent spectra.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective Access to Tetracyclic Eight&#8208;Membered Lactams through a Dearomative Heck Reaction and an Alkylative Ring&#8208;Opening Driven by the Photoexcited Spiroindolines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An external&#8208;photocatalyst&#8208;free, light&#8208;driven alkylative ring&#8208;opening of stable spiroindolines was newly developed to construct indolo&#8208; and benzoannulated eight&#8208;membered lactams. The spiroindolines were prepared from tetrahydro&#8208; &#946; &#8208;carbolines by a dearomative Heck reaction. Mechanistic experimental studies on the alkylative ring opening suggest that a photoredox pathway is involved, in which the spiroindoline performs as both reagent and photosensitizer. DFT calculations show that the stereoselective radical addition toward a cyclic alkene is the key to the diastereoselective&#160;formation of tetracyclic medium&#8208;sized membered lactams.</dc:description>

         <title>Strong Equatorial Crystal Field Enhances the Axial Anisotropy and Energy Barrier for Spin Reversal Process in Yb2 Single Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

The Magnetic Two: Three new dinuclear ytterbium complexes have been synthesized. Magnetic studies reveal that a strong equatorial crystal field enhances the axial anisotropy and effective energy barrier.







Abstract
The importance of equatorial crystal fields on magnetic anisotropy of ytterbium single molecule magnets (SMMs) is observed for the first time. Herein, we report three similar dinuclear ytterbium complexes with the formula [Yb2(3&#8208;OMe&#8208;L)2(DMF)2(NO3)2]&#8901;DMF (1), [Yb2(3&#8208;H&#8208;L)2(DMF)2(NO3)2]&#8901;DMF&#8901;H2O (2), and [Yb2(3&#8208;NO3&#8208;L)2(DMF)2(NO3)2] (3), [where 3&#8208;X&#8208;H2L=N&#8242;&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;X&#8208;benzylidene)picolinohydrazide, X=OMe (1), H (2) NO2 (3)]. Detailed magnetic measurements reveal the presence of weak antiferromagnetic interactions between the Yb centers and a field&#8208;induced slow relaxation of magnetization in all complexes. A higher energy barrier for spin reversal was observed for complex&#8197;1 (Ueff=50&#8197;K) and it decreases in the order of 2 (47&#8197;K) to 3 (40&#8197;K). Notably, complex&#8197;1 shows a remarkable energy barrier within the frequency range of 1&#8211;850&#8197;Hz reported for Yb&#8208;based SMMs. Further, ab initio calculations show a higher axial anisotropy and lower quantum tunneling of magnetization (QTM) in the ground state for 1 compared to 2 and 3. It was also observed that the presence of a strong crystal field in the equatorial plane (when the &#8737; O1&#8722;Yb&#8722;O3 bond angle is close to 90&#176;) enhances the axial anisotropy and improves the SMM behavior in the studied complexes. Both the experimental and theoretical analysis of relaxation dynamics discloses that Raman and QTM play major role on slow relaxation process for all complexes. To provide more insight into the exchange interactions, broken&#8208;symmetry DFT calculations were performed.

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Investigation on Structural and Opto&#8208;electronic Properties of Fe&#8208;Doped Lead&#8208;Free Cs2AgBiCl6 Double Perovskite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis of Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 lead&#8208;free double perovskite with blue emission using an antisolvent method. The crystal structure, morphology, optical properties, band structure, and stability of Fe&#8208;doped double perovskites are investigated systematically. Formation of Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite is confirmed by XRD and XPS analysis. XRD and TGA shows that the Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite has high structural and thermal stability, respectively. FE&#8208;SEM analysis revealed the formation of dipyramidal shape Cs2AgBiCl6 crystals. Furthermore, EDS mapping shows the overlapping of Cs, Bi, Ag, Fe, and Cl elements and homogenous incorporation of Fe in Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite. The Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite shows a strong absorption at 380 nm. It extends up to 700 nm, suggesting that sub&#8208;bandgap states transition may originate from the surface defect of the doped perovskite material. The radiative kinetics of the crystals was studied using the TCSPC technique. Lattice parameters and band gap value Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskites predicted by the DFT calculations are confirmed by XRD and UV&#8208;Visible spectroscopy analysis. Time&#8208;dependent photo&#8208;response characteristics for Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite show fast response and recovery time of charge carriers. We believe that the successful incorporation of Fe in lead&#8208;free, environmentally friendly Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite can open a new class of doped double perovskites with significant potential opto&#8208;electronics applications, photocatalysts, and photovoltaics.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Imprints Frozen by Strong Intermolecular Interactions in Place of Cross&#8208;Linking</title>

Frozen imprints: A new way to freeze molecular imprints in a polymer material is reported. Usually, molecular imprinted polymers (MIP) involve copolymerization of a functional monomer and large amounts of cross&#8208;linking agent. Here, MIPs are prepared without cross&#8208;linking agent by using stiff chains of polyaniline grafted on a solid support, and their adsorption kinetics are studied.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Frozen imprints&lt;/b&gt;: A new way to freeze molecular imprints in a polymer material is reported. Usually, molecular imprinted polymers (MIP) involve copolymerization of a functional monomer and large amounts of cross&#8208;linking agent. Here, MIPs are prepared without cross&#8208;linking agent by using stiff chains of polyaniline grafted on a solid support, and their adsorption kinetics are studied.

         <title>Construction of Hybrid Bimetallic Uranyl Compounds Based on a Preassembled Terpyridine Metalloligand</title>

Uranyl CPs: Bimetallic uranyl coordination polymers (CPs) based on terpyridine metalloligands M(cptpy)2 (Hcptpy: 4&#8242;&#8208;(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine; M: Ni2+, Fe2+, Co2+) were synthesized, and the application of these hybrid uranyl&#8211;organic framework materials in adsorption and catalysis of the cycloaddition of carbon dioxide with epoxides to form the corresponding cyclic carbonates were explored.







Abstract
Six hybrid uranyl&#8211;transition metal compounds [UO2Ni(cptpy)2(HCOO)2(DMF)(H2O)] (1), [UO2Ni(cptpy)2(BTPA)2] (2), [UO2Fe(cptpy)2(HCOO)2(DMF)(H2O)] (3), [UO2Fe(cptpy)2(BTPA)2] (4), [UO2Co(cptpy)2(HCOO)2(DMF)(H2O)] (5), and [UO2Co(cptpy)2(BTPA)2] (6), based on bifunctional ligand 4&#8242;&#8208;(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine (Hcptpy) are reported (H2BTPA = 4,4&#8242;&#8208;biphenyldicarboxylic acid). Single&#8208;crystal XRD revealed that all six compounds feature similar metalloligands, which consist of two cptpy&#8722; anions and one transition metal cation. The metalloligand M(cptpy)2 can be considered to be an extended linear dicarboxylic ligand with length of 22.12&#8197;&#197;. Compounds&#8197;1, 3, and 5 are isomers, and all of them feature 1D chain structures. The adjacent 1D chains are connected together by hydrogen bonds and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions to form a 3D porous structure, which is filled with solvent molecules and can be exchanged with I2. Compounds&#8197;2, 4, and 6 are also isomers, and all of them feature 2D honeycomb (6,3) networks with hexagonal units of dimensions 41.91&#215;26.89&#8197;&#197;, which are the largest among uranyl compounds with honeycomb networks. The large aperture allows two sets of equivalent networks to be entangled together to result in a 2D+2D&#8594;3D polycatenated framework. Remarkably, these uranyl compounds exhibit high catalytic activity for cycloaddition of carbon dioxide. Moreover, the geometric and electronic structures of compounds&#8197;1 and 2 are systematically discussed on the basis of DFT calculations.

Base pair stabilization: Heterochiral parallel duplexes represent an autonomous recognition system constructed from anomeric (&#945;/&#946;&#8208;D) oligonucleotides. The naturally occurring purine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diamine and the artificial 8&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deaza&#8208;7&#8208;bromopurine nucleosides 1 and 2 strengthen the dA&#8211;dT base pair. The 8&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deazapurine nucleoside decorated with a bromo substituent is so far the most efficient stabilizer for this pairing system.







Abstract
Stabilization of DNA is beneficial for many applications in the fields of DNA therapeutics, diagnostics, and materials science. Now, this phenomenon is studied on heterochiral DNA, an autonomous DNA recognition system with complementary strands in &#945;&#8208;D and &#946;&#8208;D configuration showing parallel strand orientation. The 12&#8208;mer heterochiral duplexes were constructed from anomeric (&#945;/&#946;&#8208;D) oligonucleotide single&#8208;strands. Purine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diamine and 8&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deaza&#8208;7&#8208;bromopurine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diamine 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyribonucleosides having the capability to form tridentate base pairs with dT were used to strengthen the stability of the dA&#8211;dT base pair. Tm data and thermodynamic values obtained from UV melting profiles indicated that the 8&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deaza 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside decorated with a bromo substituent is so far the most efficient stabilizer for heterochiral DNA. Compared with that, the stabilizing effect of the purine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diamine 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside is low. Global changes of helix structures were identified by circular dichroism (CD) spectra during melting.

         <title>Single&#8208;Step Glycosylations with 13C&#8208;Labelled Sulfoxide Donors: A&#8201;Low&#8208;Temperature NMR Cartography of the Distinguishing Mechanistic Intermediates</title>

Key glycosylation intermediates: A systematic low&#8208;temperature NMR&#8208;based study on single&#8208;step glycosylations employing 13C&#8208;labelled glycosyl sulfoxide donors provided new evidence for the key role played by long&#8208;postulated glycosylation intermediates, and allowed the detection of hitherto&#8208;unreported reactive species. The results show that glycosyl triflate intermediates remain the key players in glycosylations involving glycosyl sulfoxides, even when donor activation is performed in the presence of the acceptor alcohol.







Abstract
Glycosyl sulfoxides have gained recognition in the total synthesis of complex oligosaccharides and as model substrates for dissecting the mechanisms involved. Reactions of these donors are usually performed under pre&#8208;activation conditions, but an experimentally more convenient single&#8208;step protocol has also been reported, whereby activation is performed in the presence of the acceptor alcohol; yet, the nature and prevalence of the reaction intermediates formed in this more complex scenario have comparatively received minimal attention. Herein, a systematic NMR&#8208;based study employing both 13C&#8208;labelled and unlabelled glycosyl sulfoxide donors for the detection and monitoring of marginally populated intermediates is reported. The results conclusively show that glycosyl triflates play a key role in these glycosylations despite the presence of the acceptor alcohol. Importantly, the formation of covalent donor/acceptor sulfonium adducts was identified as the main competing reaction, and thus a non&#8208;productive consumption of the acceptor that could limit the reaction yield was revealed.

         <title>Nontoxic Cobalt(III) Schiff Base Complexes with Broad&#8208;Spectrum Antifungal Activity</title>

Metals vs. fungi: Given that metal complexes have proven to be useful new chemotypes in the fight against diseases such as cancer, malaria, and bacterial infections, it is reasonable to explore their possible utility in treating fungal infections. Herein we report a series of cobalt(III) Schiff base complexes with broad&#8208;spectrum antifungal activity against Candida and Cryptococcus yeasts, with MICs in the low micro&#8208; to nanomolar range.







Abstract
Resistance to currently available antifungal drugs has quietly been on the rise but overshadowed by the alarming spread of antibacterial resistance. There is a striking lack of attention to the threat of drug&#8208;resistant fungal infections, with only a handful of new drugs currently in development. Given that metal complexes have proven to be useful new chemotypes in the fight against diseases such as cancer, malaria, and bacterial infections, it is reasonable to explore their possible utility in treating fungal infections. Herein we report a series of cobalt(III) Schiff base complexes with broad&#8208;spectrum antifungal activity. Some of these complexes show minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) in the low micro&#8208; to nanomolar range against a series of Candida and Cryptococcus yeasts. Additionally, we demonstrate that these compounds show no cytotoxicity against both bacterial and human cells. Finally, we report the first in&#8197;vivo toxicity data on these compounds in Galleria mellonella, showing that doses as high as 266&#8197;mg&#8201;kg&#8722;1 are tolerated without adverse effects, paving the way for further in&#8197;vivo studies of these complexes.

         <title>B&#8592;N&#8208;Incorporated Dibenzo&#8208;azaacene with Selective Near&#8208;Infrared Absorption and Visible Transparency</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 6, Page 2065-2071, January 26, 2021. </description>

Dibenzo&#8208;azaacene incorporated B&#8592;N units and end&#8208;capped with benzodioxins was synthesized. These compound exhibits selective NIR absorption and high transparency in the visible regions.







Abstract
Organic compounds with selective near&#8208;infrared absorption and visible transparency are very desirable for fabrication of transparent/semitransparent optoelectronic devices. Herein, we develop a molecule with selective near&#8208;infrared absorption property, QBNA&#8208;O, in which four B&#8592;N units are incorporated to the core and two benzodioxin groups are introduced at the termini of the dibenzo&#8208;azaacene skeleton. QBNA&#8208;O exhibits a small optical gap of 1.39&#8197;eV due to the strong electron&#8208;donating benzodioxin groups and the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing B&#8592;N units. In toluene solution, QBNA&#8208;O shows a strong absorption peak at 856&#8197;nm with the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of only 41&#8197;nm as well as very weak absorption in the visible range from 380&#8197;nm to 760&#8197;nm. Thin films of QBNA&#8208;O exhibit the average visible transparency (AVT) of 78&#8201;% at the thickness of 205&#8197;nm and 90&#8201;% at the thickness of 45&#8197;nm. Solution&#8208;processed organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) of QBNA&#8208;O display ambipolar transporting behavior with the electron mobility of 0.52&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and the hole mobility of 0.013&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 together with excellent air&#8208;stability. The selective NIR absorbing property and excellent charge transporting property imply that QBNA&#8208;O can be used to fabricate transparent organic optoelectronic devices.

Composite anode materials: A general strategy is developed for the preparation of MxSy/NSC (M=Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Mn, Zn) composites through the in&#8197;situ pyrolysis of sulfonate&#8208;based M&#8208;MOF, which deliver high rate capability and long&#8208;term cycling stability (645&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 for LIBs after 1500&#8197;cycles and 426.6&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 for SIBs after 1000&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1).







Abstract
A general and simple strategy is realized for the first time for the preparation of metal sulfide (MxSy) nanoparticles immobilized into N/S co&#8208;doped carbon (NSC) through a one&#8208;step pyrolysis method. The organic ligand 1,5&#8208;naphthalenedisulfonic acid in the metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) precursor is used as a sulfur source, and metal ions are sulfurized in&#8197;situ to form MxSy nanoparticles, resulting in the formation of MxSy/NSC (M=Fe, Co, Cu, Ni, Mn, Zn) composites. Benefiting from the MxSy nanoparticles and conductive carbon, a synergistic effect of the composite is achieved. For instance, the composite of Fe7S8/NSC as an anode displays excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability in lithium/sodium ion batteries. At 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, large capacities of 645&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 426.6&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 can be retained after 1500&#8197;cycles for the lithium&#8208;ion battery and after 1000&#8197;cycles for the sodium&#8208;ion battery, respectively.

At 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, large capacities of 645&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 426.6&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; can be retained after 1500&#8197;cycles for the lithium&#8208;ion battery and after 1000&#8197;cycles for the sodium&#8208;ion battery, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Concentration&#8208;Dependent Interactions of Amphiphilic PiB Derivative Metal Complexes with Amyloid Peptides A&#946; and Amylin**
</title>

         <dc:description>
Amyloid&#8208;targeted, amphiphilic metal chelates can form different micelles in aqueous solution and this influences their affinity to amyloid peptide aggregates. The separation of the targeting PiB unit from the metal binding macrocycle by a long hydrophobic chain allows for obtaining nanomolar affinities to both A&#946;1&#8208;40 and amylin aggregates. The GdL complexes also affect the aggregation rate of A&#946;1&#8208;40.







Abstract
Metal chelates targeted to amyloid peptides are widely explored as diagnostic tools or therapeutic agents. The attachment of a metal complex to amyloid recognition units typically leads to a decrease in peptide affinity. We show here that by separating a macrocyclic GdL chelate and a PiB targeting unit with a long hydrophobic C10 linker, it is possible to attain nanomolar affinities for both A&#946;1&#8208;40 (Kd=4.4&#8197;nm) and amylin (Kd=4.5&#8197;nm), implicated, respectively in Alzheimer's disease and diabetes. The Scatchard analysis of surface plasmon resonance data obtained for a series of amphiphilic, PiB derivative GdL complexes indicate that their A&#946;1&#8208;40 or amylin binding affinity varies with their concentration, thus micellar aggregation state. The GdL chelates also affect peptide aggregation kinetics, as probed by thioflavin&#8208;T fluorescence assays. A 2D NMR study allowed identifying that the hydrophilic region of A&#946;1&#8208;40 is involved in the interaction between the monomer peptide and the Gd3+ complex. Finally, ex vivo biodistribution experiments were conducted in healthy mice by using 111In labeled analogues. Their pancreatic uptake, &#8764;3&#8201;%ID&#8201;g&#8722;1, is promising to envisage amylin imaging in diabetic animals.

         <title>Core&#8208;Modified Coelenterazine Luciferin Analogues: Synthesis and Chemiluminescence Properties</title>

Blue&#8208;hued luciferin: Can extensive alteration of the heterocyclic core of the coelenterazine ring system, a blue&#8208;hued luciferin of marine origin, lead to chemiluminescent substances and can this also &#8220;redshift&#8221; their emission spectra?







Abstract
In this work on the design and studies of luciferins related to the blue&#8208;hued coelenterazine, the synthesis of heterocyclic analogues susceptible to produce a photon, possibly at a different wavelength, is undertaken. Here, the synthesis of O&#8208;acetylated derivatives of imidazo[1,2&#8208;b]pyridazin&#8208;3(5&#8201;H)&#8208;one, imidazo[2,1&#8208;f][1,2,4]triazin&#8208;7(1&#8201;H)&#8208;one, imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;ol, imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoxalin&#8208;1(5&#8201;H)&#8208;one, benzo[f]imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoxalin&#8208;3(11&#8201;H)&#8208;one, imidazo[1&#8242;,2&#8242;:1,6]pyrazino[2,3&#8208;c]quinolin&#8208;3(11&#8201;H)&#8208;one, and 5,11&#8208;dihydro&#8208;3&#8201;H&#8208;chromeno[4,3&#8208;e]imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazin&#8208;3&#8208;one is described thanks to extensive use of the Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig N&#8208;arylation reaction. The acidic hydrolysis of these derivatives then gave solutions of the corresponding luciferin analogues, which were studied. Not too unexpectedly, even if these were &#8220;dressed&#8221; with substituents found in actual substrates of the nanoKAZ/NanoLuc luciferase, no bioluminescence was observed with these compounds. However, in a phosphate buffer, all produced a light signal, by chemiluminescence, with extensive variations in their respective intensity and this could be increased by adding a quaternary ammonium salt in the buffer. This aspect was actually instrumental to determine the emission spectra of many of these luciferin analogues.

Doped up for detox: Ceria particles play a key role in catalytic applications such as automotive three&#8208;way catalytic systems in which toxic CO and NO are respectively oxidized and reduced to safe CO2 and N2. We explored the incorporation of Cu and Cr metals as dopants in the crystal structure of ceria nanorods prepared by a single&#8208;step hydrothermal synthesis. Such co&#8208;doped ceria nanorods show synergistic improvement in reducibility and enhanced performance for CO oxidation and NO reduction.







Abstract
Ceria particles play a key role in catalytic applications such as automotive three&#8208;way catalytic systems in which toxic CO and NO are oxidized and reduced to safe CO2 and N2, respectively. In this work, we explore the incorporation of Cu and Cr metals as dopants in the crystal structure of ceria nanorods prepared by a single&#8208;step hydrothermal synthesis. XRD, Raman and XPS confirm the incorporation of Cu and Cr in the ceria crystal lattices, offering ceria nanorods with a higher concentration of oxygen vacancies. XPS also confirms the presence of Cr and Cu surface species. H2&#8208;TPR and XPS analysis show that the simultaneous Cu and Cr co&#8208;doping results in a catalyst with a higher surface Cu concentration and a much&#8208;enhanced surface reducibility, in comparison with either undoped or singly doped (Cu or Cr) ceria nanorods. While single Cu doping enhances catalytic CO oxidation and Cr doping improves catalytic NO reduction, co&#8208;doping with both Cu and Cr enhances the benefits of both dopants in a synergistic manner employing roughly a quarter of dopant weight.

         <title>High&#8208;Resolution Electronic Excitation and Emission Spectra of Pentacene and 6,13&#8208;Diazapentacene Monomers and Weakly Bound Dimers by Matrix&#8208;Isolation Spectroscopy</title>

         <dc:description>
High&#8208;resolution and fluorescence spectra of pentacene and 6,13&#8208;diazapentacene isolated in solid neon are presented. In alliance with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, the spectra give valuable information about the monomeric compounds. In addition, the matrix&#8208;isolation technique was used to generate weakly bound dimers which were spectroscopically studied for the first time, providing information about the electronic coupling therein.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heteropolycycles are among the most promising candidates for applications in organic devices. For this purpose, a profound understanding of the low&#8208;energy electronic absorbance and emission characteristics is of crucial importance. Herein, we report high&#8208;resolution absorbance and fluorescence spectra of pentacene (PEN) and 6,13&#8208;diazapentacene (DAP) in solid neon obtained using the matrix&#8208;isolation technique. Accompanying DFT calculations allow the assignment of specific vibrationally resolved signals to corresponding modes. Furthermore, we present for the first time evidence for the formation of van der Waals dimers of both substances. These dimers exhibit significantly different optical characteristics resulting from the change of electronic properties evoked by the incorporation of sp2 nitrogen into the molecular backbone.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;High&#8208;resolution and fluorescence&lt;/b&gt; spectra of pentacene and 6,13&#8208;diazapentacene isolated in solid neon are presented. In alliance with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, the spectra give valuable information about the monomeric compounds. In addition, the matrix&#8208;isolation technique was used to generate weakly bound dimers which were spectroscopically studied for the first time, providing information about the electronic coupling therein.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N&#8208;Heteropolycycles are among the most promising candidates for applications in organic devices. For this purpose, a profound understanding of the low&#8208;energy electronic absorbance and emission characteristics is of crucial importance. Herein, we report high&#8208;resolution absorbance and fluorescence spectra of pentacene (&lt;b&gt;PEN&lt;/b&gt;) and 6,13&#8208;diazapentacene (&lt;b&gt;DAP&lt;/b&gt;) in solid neon obtained using the matrix&#8208;isolation technique. Accompanying DFT calculations allow the assignment of specific vibrationally resolved signals to corresponding modes. Furthermore, we present for the first time evidence for the formation of van der Waals dimers of both substances. These dimers exhibit significantly different optical characteristics resulting from the change of electronic properties evoked by the incorporation of sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; nitrogen into the molecular backbone.&lt;/p&gt;

Desolvation of [FeL2][BF4]2&#8901;x&#8201;MeNO2 occurs via an intermediate phase, which exhibits hysteretic spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) with a reverse step in its warming branch when measured at a faster scan rate. Incomplete SCO in the final product phase reflects disorder of an L ligand. [FeL2][BF4]2&#8901;y&#8201;Me2CO contains five complex cations per asymmetric unit, four of which undergo gradual SCO in at least two discrete steps.







Abstract
4&#8208;(tert&#8208;Butylsulfanyl)&#8208;2,6&#8208;di(pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridine (L) was obtained in low yield from a one&#8208;pot reaction of 2,4,6&#8208;trifluoropyridine with 2&#8208;methylpropane&#8208;2&#8208;thiolate and sodium pyrazolate in a 1:1:2 ratio. The materials [FeL2][BF4]2&#8901;solv (1[BF4]2&#8901;solv) and [FeL2][ClO4]2&#8901;solv (1[ClO4]2&#8901;solv; solv=MeNO2, MeCN or Me2CO) exhibit a variety of structures and spin&#8208;state behaviors including thermal spin&#8208;crossover (SCO). Solvent loss on heating 1[BF4]2&#8901;x&#8201;MeNO2 (x&#8776;2.3) occurs in two steps. The intermediate phase exhibits hysteretic SCO around 250&#8197;K, involving a &#8220;reverse&#8208;SCO&#8221; step in its warming cycle at a scan rate of 5&#8197;K&#8201;min&#8722;1. The reverse&#8208;SCO is not observed in a slower 1&#8197;K&#8201;min&#8722;1 measurement, however, confirming its kinetic nature. The final product [FeL2][BF4]2&#8901;0.75&#8201;MeNO2 was crystallographically characterized, and shows abrupt but incomplete SCO at 172&#8197;K which correlates with disorder of an L ligand. The asymmetric unit of 1[BF4]2&#8901;y&#8201;Me2CO (y&#8776;1.6) contains five unique complex molecules, four of which undergo gradual SCO in at least two discrete steps. Low&#8208;spin 1[ClO4]2&#8901;0.5&#8201;Me2CO is not isostructural with its BF4&#8722; congener, and undergoes single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal solvent loss with a tripling of the crystallographic unit cell volume, while retaining the P
 space group. Three other solvate salts undergo gradual thermal SCO. Two of these are isomorphous at room temperature, but transform to different low&#8208;temperature phases when the materials are fully low&#8208;spin.

Getting stuffed: New members of the stuffed tridymite structure, Ba(Zn/Co)1&#8722;xSi1&#8722;xM2xO4 (M=Al3+ and Fe3+), are studied for multiferroic behavior and inorganic colored materials. The compounds were second harmonic generation (SHG) active and exhibit moderate ferroelectric behavior. The co&#8208;substitution of Co2+ and Fe3+ in the structure gives rise to a weak ferromagnetic behavior. The presence of transition metal elements in these oxides gives rise to brilliantly colored materials, rendering them attractive candidates for new inorganic pigments.







Abstract
The stuffed tridymite structure Ba(Zn/Co)1&#8722;xSi1&#8722;xM2xO4 (M=Al3+ and Fe3+) is explored for the possible multiferroic behavior and to develop new inorganic colored materials. The compounds were synthesized by employing conventional solid&#8208;state chemistry methods in the temperature range 1100&#8211;1175&#8201;&#176;C for 24&#8197;h. The powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) and Rietveld refinement studies indicate that the compounds stabilize in the P63 space group (no. 173). The refinement results were also rationalized by employing Raman spectroscopic studies. The compounds were found to be second harmonic generation (SHG) active and show weak ferroelectric behavior. The co&#8208;substitution of Co2+ and Fe3+ in the structure gives rise to a weak ferromagnetic behavior to the compound, BaCo0.75Si0.75Fe0.5O4, making it a multiferroic material. The optical studies on the prepared compounds exhibited blue color (Co2+ in Td geometry), purple color (Ni2+ in Td geometry), and simultaneous substitution of Co2+ and Fe3+ gives rise to blue&#8208;green color owing to metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (MMCT) effect.

Power of four: A supramolecular tetrad featuring benzothiazole, BODIPY, zinc porphyrin and fullerene has been newly assembled and occurrence of multi&#8208;step energy and electron transfer is demonstrated.







Abstract
A panchromatic triad, consisting of benzothiazole (BTZ) and BF2&#8208;chelated boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) moieties covalently linked to a zinc porphyrin (ZnP) core, has been synthesized and systematically characterized by using 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy, ESI&#8208;MS, UV&#8208;visible, steady&#8208;state fluorescence, electrochemical, and femtosecond transient absorption techniques. The absorption band of the triad, BTZ&#8208;BODIPY&#8208;ZnP, and dyads, BTZ&#8208;BODIPY and BODIPY&#8208;ZnP, along with the reference compounds BTZ&#8208;OMe, BODIPY&#8208;OMe, and ZnP&#8208;OMe exhibited characteristic bands corresponding to individual chromophores. Electrochemical measurements on BTZ&#8208;BODIPY&#8208;ZnP exhibited redox behavior similar to that of the reference compounds. Upon selective excitation of BTZ (&#8776;290&#8197;nm) in the BTZ&#8208;BODIPY&#8208;ZnP triad, the fluorescence of the BTZ moiety is quenched, due to photoinduced energy transfer (PEnT) from 1BTZ* to the BODIPY moiety, followed by quenching of the BODIPY emission due to sequential PEnT from the 1BODIPY* moiety to ZnP, resulting in the appearance of the ZnP emission, indicating the occurrence of a two&#8208;step singlet&#8211;singlet energy transfer. Further, a supramolecular tetrad, BTZ&#8208;BODIPY&#8208;ZnP:ImC60, was formed by axially coordinating the triad with imidazole&#8208;appended fulleropyrrolidine (ImC60), and parallel steady&#8208;state measurements displayed the diminished emission of ZnP, which clearly indicated the occurrence of photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from 1ZnP* to ImC60. Finally, femtosecond transient absorption spectral studies provided evidence for the sequential occurrence of PEnT and PET events, namely, 1BTZ*&#8208;BODIPY&#8208;ZnP:ImC60&#8594;BTZ&#8208;1BODIPY*&#8208;ZnP:ImC60&#8594;BTZ&#8208;BODIPY&#8208;1ZnP*:ImC60&#8594;BTZ&#8208;BODIPY&#8208;ZnP.+:ImC60.&#8722; in the supramolecular tetrad. The evaluated rate of energy transfer, kEnT, was found to be 3&#8211;5&#215;1010&#8197;s&#8722;1, which was slightly faster than that observed in the case of BODIPY&#8208;ZnP and BTZ&#8208;BODIPY&#8208;ZnP, lacking the coordinated ImC60. The rate constants for charge separation and recombination, kCS and kCR, respectively, calculated by monitoring the rise and decay of C60.&#8722; were found to be 5.5&#215;1010 and 4.4&#215;108&#8197;s&#8722;1, respectively, for the BODIPY&#8208;ZnP:ImC60 triad, and 3.1&#215;1010 and 4.9&#215;108&#8197;s&#8722;1, respectively, for the BTZ&#8208;BODIPY&#8208;ZnP:ImC60 tetrad. Initial excitation of the tetrad, promoting two&#8208;step energy transfer and a final electron&#8208;transfer event, has been successfully demonstrated in the present study.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Power of four&lt;/b&gt;: A supramolecular tetrad featuring benzothiazole, BODIPY, zinc porphyrin and fullerene has been newly assembled and occurrence of multi&#8208;step energy and electron transfer is demonstrated.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A panchromatic triad, consisting of benzothiazole (BTZ) and BF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;chelated boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) moieties covalently linked to a zinc porphyrin (ZnP) core, has been synthesized and systematically characterized by using &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy, ESI&#8208;MS, UV&#8208;visible, steady&#8208;state fluorescence, electrochemical, and femtosecond transient absorption techniques. The absorption band of the triad, BTZ&#8208;BODIPY&#8208;ZnP, and dyads, BTZ&#8208;BODIPY and BODIPY&#8208;ZnP, along with the reference compounds BTZ&#8208;OMe, BODIPY&#8208;OMe, and ZnP&#8208;OMe exhibited characteristic bands corresponding to individual chromophores. Electrochemical measurements on BTZ&#8208;BODIPY&#8208;ZnP exhibited redox behavior similar to that of the reference compounds.

&lt;sup&gt;.&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in the supramolecular tetrad. The evaluated rate of energy transfer, &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;EnT&lt;/sub&gt;, was found to be 3&#8211;5&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which was slightly faster than that observed in the case of BODIPY&#8208;ZnP and BTZ&#8208;BODIPY&#8208;ZnP, lacking the coordinated ImC&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;.

         <title>Identification of Isomeric N&#8208;Glycans by Conformer Distribution Fingerprinting using Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 6, Page 2149-2154, January 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Well&#8208;defined synthetic glycans were used to show that ATDs in IMS&#8208;MS resemble gas&#8208;phase conformational populations, which was also confirmed by molecular dynamics simulation. By applying a database with intrinsic gas&#8208;phase conformer distribution fingerprints, protein&#8208;released N&#8208;glycans, including isomeric structures, could be identified rapidly and unambiguously without the need for MS/MS experiments.







Abstract
Glycans possess unparalleled structural complexity arising from chemically similar monosaccharide building blocks, configurations of anomeric linkages and different branching patterns, potentially giving rise to many isomers. This level of complexity is one of the main reasons that identification of exact glycan structures in biological samples still lags behind that of other biomolecules. Here, we introduce a methodology to identify isomeric N&#8208;glycans by determining gas phase conformer distributions (CDs) by measuring arrival time distributions (ATDs) using drift&#8208;tube ion mobility spectrometry&#8208;mass spectrometry. Key to the approach is the use of a range of well&#8208;defined synthetic glycans that made it possible to investigate conformer distributions in the gas phase of isomeric glycans in a systematic manner. In addition, we have computed CD fingerprints by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, which compared well with experimentally determined CDs. It supports that ATDs resemble conformational populations in the gas phase and offer the prospect that such an approach can contribute to generating a library of CCS distributions (CCSDs) for structure identification.

         <title>Partnering a Three&#8208;Coordinate Gallium Cation with a Hydroborate Counter&#8208;Ion for the Catalytic Hydrosilylation of CO2</title>

Selective: Addition of one equivalent of B(C6F5)3 to (DippNacnac)Ga(Ad)H leads to the formation of a 3&#8208;coordinate cationic gallane, partnered with a hydroborate anion, [(DippNacnac)Ga(Ad)][HB(C6F5)3], which catalyses the selective reduction of CO2 to the formaldehyde oxidation level, yielding H2C(OSiEt3)2.







Abstract
A novel &#946;&#8208;diketiminate stabilized gallium hydride, (DippL)Ga(Ad)H (where (DippL)={HC(MeCDippN)2}, Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl and Ad=1&#8208;adamantyl), has been synthesized and shown to undergo insertion of carbon dioxide into the Ga&#8722;H bond under mild conditions. In this case, treatment of the resulting &#954;1&#8208;formate complex with triethylsilane does not lead to regeneration of the hydride precursor. However, when combined with B(C6F5)3, (DippL)Ga(Ad)H catalyses the reductive hydrosilylation of CO2. Under stoichiometric conditions, the addition of one equivalent of B(C6F5)3 to (DippL)Ga(Ad)H leads to the formation of a 3&#8208;coordinate cationic gallane complex, partnered with a hydroborate anion, [(DippL)Ga(Ad)][HB(C6F5)3]. This complex rapidly hydrometallates carbon dioxide and catalyses the selective reduction of CO2 to the formaldehyde oxidation level at 60&#8201;&#176;C in the presence of Et3SiH (yielding H2C(OSiEt3)2). When catalysis is undertaken in the presence of excess B(C6F5)3, appreciable enhancement of activity is observed, with a corresponding reduction in selectivity: the product distribution includes H2C(OSiEt3)2, CH4 and O(SiEt3)2. While this system represents proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept in CO2 hydrosilylation by a gallium hydride system, the TOF values obtained are relatively modest (max. 10&#8197;h&#8722;1). This is attributed to the strength of binding of the formatoborate anion to the gallium centre in the catalytic intermediate (DippL)Ga(Ad){OC(H)OB(C6F5)3}, and the correspondingly slow rate of the turnover&#8208;limiting hydrosilylation step. In turn, this strength of binding can be related to the relatively high Lewis acidity measured for the [(DippL)Ga(Ad)]+ cation (AN=69.8).

         <title>Understanding the Deactivation Pathways of Iridium(III) Pyridine&#8208;Carboxiamide Catalysts for Formic Acid Dehydrogenation</title>

         <dc:description>
The in situ hydrogenation of the carboxiamide functionality of the ancillary ligand has been identified as the main deactivation pathway of IrIII&#8208;picolinamide catalysts for formic acid dehydrogenation. This was proven by a combined experimental and computational approach, including spectroscopic and catalytic tests on the independently synthesized degradation product with &#954;2&#8208;N,N&#8208;pyridine&#8208;amine ligand.







Abstract
The degradation pathways of highly active [Cp*Ir(&#954;2&#8208;N,N&#8208;R&#8208;pica)Cl] catalysts (pica=picolinamidate; 1 R=H, 2 R=Me) for formic acid (FA) dehydrogenation were investigated by NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Under acidic conditions (1&#8197;equiv. of HNO3), 2 undergoes partial protonation of the amide moiety, inducing rapid &#954;2&#8208;N,N to &#954;2&#8208;N,O ligand isomerization. Consistently, DFT modeling on the simpler complex&#8197;1 showed that the &#954;2&#8208;N,N key intermediate of FA dehydrogenation (INH), bearing a N&#8208;protonated pica, can easily transform into the &#954;2&#8208;N,O analogue (INH2; &#916;G&#8800;&#8776;11&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, &#916;G &#8776;&#8722;5&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Intramolecular hydrogen liberation from INH2 is predicted to be rather prohibitive (&#916;G&#8800;&#8776;26&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, &#916;G&#8776;23&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1), indicating that FA dehydrogenation should involve mostly &#954;2&#8208;N,N intermediates, at least at relatively high pH. Under FA dehydrogenation conditions, 2 was progressively consumed, and the vast majority of the Ir centers (58&#8201;%) were eventually found in the form of Cp*&#8208;complexes with a pyridine&#8208;amine ligand. This likely derived from hydrogenation of the pyridine&#8208;carboxiamide via a hemiaminal intermediate, which could also be detected. Clear evidence for ligand hydrogenation being the main degradation pathway also for 1 was obtained, as further confirmed by spectroscopic and catalytic tests on the independently synthesized degradation product&#8197;1&#8201;c. DFT calculations confirmed that this side reaction is kinetically and thermodynamically accessible.

         <title>CO&#8208;Induced Dinitrogen Fixation and Cleavage Mediated by Boron</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 6, Page 2131-2137, January 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO&#8208;induced dinitrogen fixation and cleavage mediated by boron atoms is reported. The experimental and theoretical results show that the N&#8801;N activation processes proceed with the initial formation of an end&#8208;on bonded NNBCO complex, which rearranges to the NBNCO and B(NCO)2 isocyanate complexes via a side&#8208;on bonded (&#951;2&#8208;N2)BCO intermediate. The geometries, energies and vibrational spectra of the molecules are calculated with quantum chemical methods and the electronic structures are analyzed with charge&#8208; and energy&#8208;partitioning methods.







Abstract
The boron atoms react with carbon monoxide and dinitrogen forming the end&#8208;on bonded NNBCO complex in solid neon or in nitrogen matrices. The NNBCO complex rearranges to the (&#951;2&#8208;N2)BCO isomer with a more activated side&#8208;on bonded dinitrogen ligand upon visible light excitation. (&#951;2&#8208;N2)BCO and its weakly CO&#8208;coordinated complexes further isomerize to the NBNCO and B(NCO)2 molecules with N&#8722;N bond being completely cleaved under UV light irradiation. The geometries, energies and vibrational spectra of the molecules are calculated with quantum chemical methods and the electronic structures are analyzed with charge&#8208; and energy&#8208;partitioning methods.

         <title>Enzyme Multifunctionality by Control of Substrate Positioning Within the Catalytic Cycle&#8212;A QM/MM Study of Clavaminic Acid Synthase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 6, Page 2196-2211, January 26, 2021. </description>

Enzyme control. A QM/MM study of clavaminic acid synthase reveals that the enzyme&#8211;substrate interactions either constrain the position of the substrate during reaction, hindering processes other than OH rebound, or allow some change in the substrate's position/conformation, thus leading to desaturation. This differential effect originates from the different strengths of the interactions between two aspartate residues and the hydroxylation/desaturation substrates.







Abstract
Clavaminic acid synthase from Streptomyces&#8197;clavuligerus is an FeII/2&#8208;oxoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenase, crucial for the biosynthesis of the &#946;&#8208;lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. It catalyses three consecutive oxidative reactions, that is, hydroxylation, cyclisation and desaturation, in a single binding cavity. As follows from the results of this QM/MM study, CAS versatility and selectivity depends on the binding cavity, which interplays differently with the substrate for each reaction. The enzyme&#8211;substrate interactions affect the substrate's ability to re&#8208;position during the reaction, either constraining it in its primary position, which impedes processes other than oxygen rebound, or allowing change, which facilitates desaturation. This differential effect originates from two aspartate residues, which strongly interact with the guanidine group of the hydroxylation substrate and stabilise the orientation of the molecule. These residues interact less effectively with the smaller amine group of the desaturation substrate(s), aiding their re&#8208;positioning and the subsequent formation of a double bond.

         <title>Selective Modification for Red&#8208;Shifted Excitability: A Small Change in Structure, a Huge Change in Photochemistry</title>

What a difference one atom makes: Azetidine (az) and dimethylamino (DMA) donor moieties differ only by one carbon atom in their molecular formula, but in the present study we observed huge differences in their impact on the photochemistry of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A caging groups. Restriction of the degrees of movement freedom&#8212;due to the four&#8208;membered ring&#8212;leads to a photocage that can be used within the &#8220;green gap&#8221; for the release of biologically relevant leaving groups (e.g., glutamic acid).







Abstract
We developed three bathochromic, green&#8208;light activatable, photolabile protecting groups based on a nitrodibenzofuran (NDBF) core with D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A push&#8211;pull structures. Variation of donor substituents (D) at the favored ring position enabled us to observe their impact on the photolysis quantum yields. Comparing our new azetidinyl&#8208;NDBF (Az&#8208;NDBF) photolabile protecting group with our earlier published DMA&#8208;NDBF, we obtained insight into its excitation&#8208;specific photochemistry. While the &#8220;two&#8208;photon&#8208;only&#8221; cage DMA&#8208;NDBF was inert against one&#8208;photon excitation (1PE) in the visible spectral range, we were able to efficiently release glutamic acid from azetidinyl&#8208;NDBF with irradiation at 420 and 530&#8197;nm. Thus, a minimal change (a cyclization adding only one carbon atom) resulted in a drastically changed photochemical behavior, which enables photolysis in the green part of the spectrum.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly Approach Towards MoS2&#8208;Embedded Hierarchical Porous Carbons for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>

Reactive micelles: Due to its high stability and unique core&#8211;shell structure, unimicelle could be hypercrosslinked into ionic hypercrosslinked micellar frameworks, which were used as a soft template to prepare tunable hierarchical porous carbons with confined MoS2 growth for enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;based nanoparticle&#8208;embedded carbon materials have received increasing attention for constructing next&#8208;generation electrochemical catalysts for energy storage and conversion. However, designing hybrid carbon materials with controllable hierarchical micro/mesoporous structures, excellent dispersion of metal nanoparticles, and multiple heteroatom&#8208;doping remains challenging. Here, a novel pyridinium&#8208;containing ionic hypercrosslinked micellar frameworks (IHMFs) prepared from the core&#8211;shell unimicelle of s&#8208;poly(tert&#8208;butyl acrylate)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(4&#8208;bromomethyl) styrene (s&#8208;PtBA&#8208;b&#8208;PBMS) and linear poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine) were used as self&#8208;sacrificial templates for confined growth of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) inside cationic IHMFs through electrostatic interaction. After pyrolysis, MoS2&#8208;anchored nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbons possessing tunable hierarchical micro/mesoporous structures and favorable distributions of MoS2 nanoparticles exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction as well as small Tafel slope of 66.7&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, low onset potential, and excellent cycling stability under acidic condition. Crucially, hierarchical micro/mesoporous structure and high surface area could boost their catalytic hydrogen evolution performance. This approach provides a novel route for preparation of micro/mesoporous hybrid carbon materials with confined transition metal nanoparticles for electrochemical energy conversion.

Making industry greener: Many principles for the economic production of organic bulk chemicals, the syntheses of which have potentially the highest environmental impact, currently overlap with principles of green chemistry. However, there remain enough challenges in making industrial organic synthesis even greener while keeping them efficient, which requires research and innovative processes. How efficient industrial organic chemistry can go hand in hand with principles of green chemistry is reflected in this Science Voices article.

The thinnest possible films of the glass&#8208;forming materials silica and germania were so far investigatd by employing scanning probe microscopy and density functional theory calculations. A more general comprehension of the network structure of glass former materials allows to understand the crucial role of the metal support for the pathway from crystalline to amorphous ultrathin film growth. For more information, see the Review by M. Heyde et&#8197;al. on page 1870.

Advanced electrodes with good rate capability and cycling stability are key components in energy storage devices for future electric vehicles, portable electronics, and smart grids. As a new family of 2D materials, MXenes have attracted much attention for use as electrode materials due to their good electrical conductivity and excellent electrochemical properties. In their minireview on page 1921, B. Luo, L. Wang et&#8197;al. present an overview of recent progress on the interlayer space engineering of MXenes by different chemical strategies, such as intercalation, surface modification and heterostructures design. The interlayer space engineering provides extra room to further enhance their electrochemical properties, especially high redox activity and rate capability for energy storage.

         <dc:description>
The mechanistic study of one&#8208;step sulfoxide glycosylations enabled by the employment of 13C&#8208;labelled glycosyl&#8208;donors and low&#8208;temperature NMR revealed the internal dynamics between all reaction intermediates involved in this process, which are represented in the accompanying image as a molecular rollercoaster. The formation and stability of donor/acceptor sulfonium adducts, inherent to this particular experimental protocol, defines the scope of this synthetic methodology. More information can be found in the Full Paper by A.&#8197;G. Santana, J.&#8197;L. Asensio, et&#8197;al. on page 2030.

         <title>Cover Feature: Structure&#8208;Directing Roles of Organic Molecules in the Formation of Aluminosilicate and Aluminophosphate Molecular Sieves Revealed by 2D 1H DQ&#8208;SQ NMR Spectroscopy (Chem. Eur. J. 6/2021)</title>

Molecular sieves are generally prepared under hydrothermal conditions with reactions happening in &#8220;black box&#8221; autoclaves; the crystallization mechanism of molecular sieves is still a mystery, therefore, which is depicted by the UFO in the cover image. Further understanding of the crystallization mechanism of molecular sieves is driven by the broad range of usefulness and unique properties they possess. In this work, 2D 1H DQ&#8208;SQ NMR results clearly demonstrate that it is not only the electrostatic interactions between organic structure&#8208;directing agents (OSDAs) and the framework, but also the correlation among OSDAs playing the dominant structural directing roles during the crystallization process. More information can be found in the Communication by X. Liu et&#8197;al. on page 1955.

Metal chelates targeted to amyloid peptides are widely explored as diagnostic tools or therapeutic agents. Such amphiphilic chelates form pre&#8208;micelles and micelles in aqueous solution. This work shows that the aggregation state strongly affects their affinity for A&#946;1&#8208;40 or amylin amyloid fibrils, present in the brain and in the pancreas, and implicated in Alzheimer's disease or diabetes, respectively.

Ultrathin films: Comparison of silica and germania thin films to understand the crucial role of the metal support for the pathway from crystalline to amorphous structures.







Abstract
The present review reports on the preparation and atomic&#8208;scale characterization of the thinnest possible films of the glass&#8208;forming materials silica and germania. To this end state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art surface science techniques, in particular scanning probe microscopy, and density functional theory calculations have been employed. The investigated films range from monolayer to bilayer coverage where both, the crystalline and the amorphous films, contain characteristic XO4 (X=Si,Ge) building blocks. A side&#8208;by&#8208;side comparison of silica and germania monolayer, zigzag phase and bilayer films supported on Mo(112), Ru(0001), Pt(111), and Au(111) leads to a more general comprehension of the network structure of glass former materials. This allows us to understand the crucial role of the metal support for the pathway from crystalline to amorphous ultrathin film growth.

         <title>Main Group Multiple Bonds for Bond Activations and Catalysis</title>

The versatile reactivity of molecular main group multiple bonds is covered in this Minireview, from small molecule activation to catalysis and to their role as synthons in further functionalisation reactions.







Abstract
Since the discovery that the so&#8208;called &#8220;double&#8208;bond&#8221; rule could be broken, the field of molecular main group multiple bonds has expanded rapidly. With the majority of homodiatomic double and triple bonds realised within the p&#8208;block, along with many heterodiatomic combinations, this Minireview examines the reactivity of these compounds with a particular emphasis on small molecule activation. Furthermore, whilst their ability to act as transition metal mimics has been explored, their catalytic behaviour is somewhat limited. This Minireview aims to highlight the potential of these complexes towards catalytic application and their role as synthons in further functionalisations making them a versatile tool for the modern synthetic chemist.

         <title>Interlayer Space Engineering of MXenes for Electrochemical Energy Storage Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 6, Page 1921-1940, January 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>

Abstract
The increasing demand for high&#8208;performance rechargeable energy storage systems has stimulated the exploration of advanced electrode materials. MXenes are a class of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) inorganic transition metal carbides/nitrides, which are promising candidates in electrodes. The layered structure facilitates ion insertion/extraction, which offers promising electrochemical characteristics for electrochemical energy storage. However, the low capacity accompanied by sluggish electrochemical kinetics of electrodes as well as interlayer restacking and collapse significantly impede their practical applications. Recently, interlayer space engineering of MXenes by different chemical strategies have been widely investigated in designing functional materials for various applications. In this review, an overview of the most recent progress of 2D MXenes engineering by intercalation, surface modification as well as heterostructures design is provided.

         <title>Turning Photons into Drugs: Phthalocyanine&#8208;Based Photosensitizers as Efficient Photoantimicrobials</title>

A description of the phthalocyanine&#8208;based photosensitizers used in antimicrobial photodynamic therapy is provided in this Review. Special focus is put on structure&#8211;activity relationship.







Abstract
One of the most promising alternatives for treating bacterial infections is antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT), making the synthesis and application of new photoactive compounds called photosensitizers (PS) a dynamic research field. In this regard, phthalocyanine (Pc) derivatives offer great opportunities due to their extraordinary light&#8208;harvesting and tunable electronic properties, structural versatility, and stability. This Review, rather than focusing on synthetic strategies, intends to overview current progress in the structural design strategies for Pcs that could achieve effective photoinactivation of microorganisms. In addition, the Review provides a concise look into the recent developments and applications of nanocarrier&#8208;based Pc delivery systems.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Mediated Functionalization of White Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 6, Page 1886-1902, January 26, 2021. </description>

The activation of P4 by transition&#8208;metal complexes has become well established, due to a desire to find new and improved routes for its transformation into useful P&#8208;containing compounds. However, the next necessary step&#8212;functionalization of the resulting metal&#8208;bound Pn moieties&#8212;has proven extremely challenging and has only occasionally been achieved. Herein, a comprehensive review of these important transformations is provided.







Abstract
Recently there has been great interest in the reactivity of transition&#8208;metal (TM) centers towards white phosphorus (P4). This has ultimately been motivated by a desire to find TM&#8208;mediated alternatives to the current industrial routes used to transform P4 into myriad useful P&#8208;containing products, which are typically indirect, wasteful, and highly hazardous. Such a TM&#8208;mediated process can be divided into two steps: activation of P4 to generate a polyphosphorus complex TM&#8208;Pn, and subsequent functionalization of this complex to release the desired phosphorus&#8208;containing product. The former step has by now become well established, allowing the isolation of many different TM&#8208;Pn products. In contrast, productive functionalization of these complexes has proven extremely challenging and has been achieved only in a relative handful of cases. In this review we provide a comprehensive summary of successful TM&#8208;Pn functionalization reactions, where TM&#8208;Pn must be accessible by reaction of a TM precursor with P4. We hope that this will provide a useful resource for continuing efforts that are working towards this highly challenging goal of modern synthetic chemistry.

Germaborenes act as borylene transfer agents to azides in the synthesis of iminoboranes.







Abstract
Halide and phenyl substituted germaborenes were shown to react with azides at room temperature and transfer a borylene moiety to give iminoboranes. This iminoborane synthesis based on a borylene transfer route was investigated computationally in the case of the phenyl substituted germaborene.

         <title>Pyridinic Nanographenes by Novel Precursor Design</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 6, Page 1984-1989, January 26, 2021. </description>

An efficient Scholl oxidation to obtain pyridine HBCs is reported in this work. The concept is based on the pre&#8208;formation of bonds at the otherwise unreactive 3/3&#8217; positions of the pyridine. Post&#8208;functionalization at the nitrogen atom by alkylation, oxidation, and coordination is demonstrated together with photophysical and electrochemical characterization of the obtained products.







Abstract
In this work we present the solution&#8208;synthesis of pyridine analogues to hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC)&#8212;which might be called superpyridines&#8212;via a novel precursor design. The key step in our strategy was the pre&#8208;formation of the C&#8722;C bonds between the 3/3&#8217; positions of the pyridine and the adjacent phenyl rings&#8212;bonds that are otherwise unreactive and difficult to close under Scholl&#8208;conditions. Apart from the synthesis of the parent compound we show that classical pyridine chemistry, namely oxidation, N&#8208;alkylation and metal&#8208;coordination is applicable to the &#960;&#8208;extended analogue. Furthermore, we present basic physical chemical characterizations of the newly synthesized molecules. With this novel synthetic strategy, we hope to unlock the pyridine chemistry of nanographenes.

         <title>Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based [c2]Daisy Chain Rotaxane Insulating Two Diarylacetylene Cores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 6, Page 1966-1969, January 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A [c2]daisy chain rotaxane, in which two independent diarylacetylene cores are insulated by two permethylated &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrins (PM &#945;&#8208;CDs), is efficiently synthesized using the Janus [2]rotaxane strategy. The observation of both monomer and excimer emission in various solvents reveals that frequent shuttling of the rotaxane subunits occurs in solution.







Abstract
A [c2]daisy chain rotaxane with two diarylacetylene cores was efficiently synthesized in 53&#8201;% yield by capping a C2&#8208;symmetric pseudo[2]rotaxane composed of two diarylacetylene&#8208;substituted permethylated &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrins (PM &#945;&#8208;CDs) with aniline stoppers. The maximum absorption wavelength of the [c2]daisy chain rotaxane remained almost unchanged in various solvents, unlike that of the stoppered monomer, indicating that the two independent diarylacetylene cores were insulated from the external environment by the PM &#945;&#8208;CDs. Furthermore, the [c2]daisy chain rotaxane exhibited fluorescence emission derived from both diarylacetylene monomers and the excimer, which implies that the [c2]daisy chain structure can undergo contraction and extension. This is the first demonstration of a system in which excimer formation between two &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules within an isolated space can be controlled by the unique motion of a [c2]daisy chain rotaxane.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A [c2]daisy chain rotaxane&lt;/b&gt;, in which two independent diarylacetylene cores are insulated by two permethylated &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrins (PM &#945;&#8208;CDs), is efficiently synthesized using the Janus [2]rotaxane strategy. The observation of both monomer and excimer emission in various solvents reveals that frequent shuttling of the rotaxane subunits occurs in solution.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A [c2]daisy chain rotaxane with two diarylacetylene cores was efficiently synthesized in 53&#8201;% yield by capping a C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;symmetric pseudo[2]rotaxane composed of two diarylacetylene&#8208;substituted permethylated &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrins (PM &#945;&#8208;CDs) with aniline stoppers. The maximum absorption wavelength of the [c2]daisy chain rotaxane remained almost unchanged in various solvents, unlike that of the stoppered monomer, indicating that the two independent diarylacetylene cores were insulated from the external environment by the PM &#945;&#8208;CDs. Furthermore, the [c2]daisy chain rotaxane exhibited fluorescence emission derived from both diarylacetylene monomers and the excimer, which implies that the [c2]daisy chain structure can undergo contraction and extension. This is the first demonstration of a system in which excimer formation between two &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules within an isolated space can be controlled by the unique motion of a [c2]daisy chain rotaxane.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>The Photosensitizing Efficacy of Micelles Containing a Porphyrinic Photosensitizer and KI against Resistant Melanoma Cells</title>

To overcome the poor solubility of porphyrins in biological systems, this communication reports the simultaneous encapsulation of a porphyrinic photosensitizer and KI into a lipid&#8208;based drug delivery system. After being prepared and duly characterized, these micelles were used in the photodynamic treatment of melanoma cells. As expected, the photodynamic efficacy increases as the concentration of both porphyrin and KI encapsulated also increases.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising alternative to overcome the resistance of melanoma to conventional therapies. Currently applied photosensitizers (PS) are often based on tetrapyrrolic macrocycles like porphyrins. Unfortunately, in some cases the use of this type of derivative is limited due to their poor solubility in the biological environment. Feasible approaches to surpass this drawback are based on lipid formulations. Besides that, and inspired in the efficacy of potassium iodide (KI) for antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT), the combined effect of singlet oxygen (1O2) with KI was assessed in this work, as an alternative strategy to potentiate the effect of PDT against resistant melanoma cells.

         <title>Highly Regioselective 5&#8208;endo&#8208;tet Cyclization of 3,4&#8208;Epoxy Amines into 3&#8208;Hydroxypyrrolidines Catalyzed by La(OTf)3</title>

         <dc:description>
Highly regioselective intramolecular aminolysis of 3,4&#8208;epoxy amines has been achieved by chemoselective activation of epoxides by a La(OTf)3 catalyst to induce anti&#8208;Baldwin 5&#8208;endo&#8208;tet cyclization in high yields. DFT calculations revealed that the regioselectivity might be attributed to distortion energies of epoxy amines. The use of this reaction was demonstrated by the first enantioselective synthesis of an antispasmodic agent.







Abstract
Highly regioselective intramolecular aminolysis of 3,4&#8208;epoxy amines has been achieved. Key features of this reaction are (1)&#8197;chemoselective activation of epoxides in the presence of unprotected aliphatic amines in the same molecules by a La(OTf)3 catalyst and (2)&#8197;excellent regioselectivity for anti&#8208;Baldwin 5&#8208;endo&#8208;tet cyclization. This reaction affords 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;alkylpyrrolidines stereospecifically in high yields. DFT calculations revealed that the regioselectivity might be attributed to distortion energies of epoxy amine substrates. The use of this reaction was demonstrated by the first enantioselective synthesis of an antispasmodic agent prifinium bromide.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Directing Roles of Organic Molecules in the Formation of Aluminosilicate and Aluminophosphate Molecular Sieves Revealed by 2D 1H DQ&#8208;SQ NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 6, Page 1955-1960, January 26, 2021. </description>

In most cases, the zeolitic structure does not reflect the geometric and electronic structures of the OSDA molecule, which raised the question on the &#8220;structure&#8208;directing effect&#8221; of OSDA molecules&#8212;&#8220;how can one OSDA give rise to more than one zeolitic structure&#8221;? One good example is TMAda+, which can be used to prepare ITQ&#8208;1 (&#8810;150&#8201;&#176;C) and SSZ&#8208;13 (&gt;150&#8201;&#176;C).)







Abstract
Understanding of crystallization mechanisms of molecular sieves is driven by the broad range of usefulness and unique properties they possess. It is still difficult to obtain information related to the crystallization mechanism of molecular sieves, partly because the materials are generally prepared under hydrothermal conditions and the whole reaction happens in the &#8220;black box&#8221; autoclave. In this work, 2D 1H DQ&#8208;SQ NMR results clearly demonstrate that it is not only the electrostatic interactions between organic structure&#8208;directing agents (OSDAs) and the framework, but also the correlation among OSDAs playing the dominant structural directing roles during the crystallization process. Our fundamental understanding of the crystallization mechanism of molecular sieves could be of great value to design and synthesize new molecular sieves with desirable structural properties.

Oxidation of N,N&#8217;&#8208;diarylated dihydroazaacenes furnishes three stable dihydroazaacene radical cations characterized by means of UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy, single crystal analysis, and DFT calculations.







Abstract
Three stable N,N&#8217;&#8208;diarylated dihydroazaacene radical cations were prepared by oxidation of neutral N,N&#8217;&#8208;diarylated dihydroazaacenes synthesized via palladium&#8208;catalyzed Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig aminations of aryl iodides with N,N&#8217;&#8208;dihydroazaacenes. Both neutral as well as oxidized species were investigated via UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy, single crystal analysis, and DFT calculations. All the radical cations are surprisingly stable&#8212;their absorption spectra in dichloromethane remain unchanged in ambient conditions for at least 24&#8197;hours.

         <title>Highly Deformed o&#8208;Carborane Functionalised Non&#8208;linear Polycyclic Aromatics with Exceptionally Long C&#8722;C Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 6, Page 1970-1975, January 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
o&#8208;Carborane&#8208;functionalised phenanthrene and benzo(k)tetraphene are reported in this work; two highly sterically hindered structures, with the latter displaying the largest aromatic deformation parameters of any organo&#8208;substituted o&#8208;carborane compound, and amongst the longest carboranyl C&#8722;C bond. Functionalisation of these polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons induces stimuli&#8208;responsive luminescence properties, including aggregation&#8208;induced emission.

The effect of substituting o&#8208;carborane into the most sterically hindered positions of phenanthrene and benzo(k)tetraphene is reported. Synthesised via a Bull&#8211;Hutchings&#8211;Quayle benzannulation, the crystal structures of these non&#8208;linear acenes exhibited the highest aromatic deformation parameters observed for any reported carborane compound to date, and among the largest carboranyl C&#8722;C bond length of all organo&#8208;substituted o&#8208;carboranes. Photoluminescence studies of these compounds demonstrated efficient intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer, leading to aggregation induced emission properties. Additionally, an unusual low&#8208;energy excimer was observed for the phenanthryl compound. These are two new members of the family of carborane&#8208;functionalised non&#8208;linear acenes, notable for their peculiar structures and multi&#8208;luminescent properties.

&lt;b&gt;&#8208;Carborane&#8208;functionalised&lt;/b&gt; phenanthrene and benzo(k)tetraphene are reported in this work; two highly sterically hindered structures, with the latter displaying the largest aromatic deformation parameters of any organo&#8208;substituted &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;carborane compound, and amongst the longest carboranyl C&#8722;C bond.

&#8220;We show here that micellar aggregation of amphiphilic Gd3+ complexes drastically influences their binding affinity to &#946;&#8208;amyloid or amylin, implicated in Alzheimer's disease and in diabetes, respectively. The monomeric form is the strongest binder and can attain as high as nanomolar affinities.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;2009&#8197;ff. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202004000).

The image depicts that when an amphiphilic compound is intravenously injected, monomer, pre&#8208;micellar and micellar forms can co&#8208;exist in the blood and have different affinities for amyloid peptides.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The novel diacetylene bridged terphenylic macrocycle 1 is presented and discussed in the context of rotationally restricted &#8220;Gel&#228;nder&#8221; oligomers. The 1,4&#8208;bis(phenylbuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyn&#8208;1&#8208;yl) benzene bridge of diacetylene 1 is significantly longer than its terphenyl backbone, forcing the bridge to bend around the central pylon. The synthesis of molecule 1 is based to a large extent on acetylene scaffolding strategies, profiting from orthogonal alkyne protection groups to close both macrocyclic subunits by oxidative acetylene coupling sequentially. The spatial arrangement and the dynamic enantiomerization process of the bicyclic target structure 1 are analyzed. In&#8208;depth NMR investigations not only reveal an unexpected spatial arrangement with both oligomer strands bent alongside the backbone, but also display the limited stability of the model compound in the presence of molecular oxygen.</dc:description>

         <title>Altered Membrane Mechanics Provides a Receptor&#8208;Independent&#160; Pathway for Serotonin Action</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Serotonin, an important signaling molecule in humans, has an unexpectedly high lipid membrane affinity. The significance of this finding has evoked considerable speculation. Here we show that membrane binding by serotonin can directly modulate membrane pro&#173;perties and cellular function, providing an activity pathway completely independent of serotonin receptors. Atomic force microscopy shows that serotonin makes artificial lipid bilayers softer, and induces nucle&#173;ation of liquid disordered domains inside the raft&#8208;like liquid&#8208;ordered domains. Solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy corroborates this data at the atomic level, revealing a homogeneous decrease in the order para&#173;meter of the lipid chains in the presence of serotonin. In the RN46A immortalized serotonergic neuronal cell line, extracellular serotonin enhances transferrin receptor endocytosis, even in the presence of broad&#8208;spectrum serotonin receptor and transporter inhibitors. Simi&#173;larly, it increases the membrane binding and internalization of oligo&#173;meric peptides. Our results uncover a mode of serotonin&#8208;membrane interaction that can potentiate key cellular processes in a receptor&#8208;independent fashion.</dc:description>

         <title>Directed Design of a AuI Complex with a Reduced Mesoionic Carbene Radical&#8208;Ligand: Insights from 1,2,3&#8208;Triazolylidene Selenium Adducts and Extensive Electrochemical Investigations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbene&#8208;based radicals are important for both fundamental and applied chemical research. We herein report extensive electrochemical investigations of nine different 1,2,3&#8208;triazolylidene selenium adducts. We found that the half&#8208;wave potentials of the first reduction of the selones correlate with their calculated LUMO energies and LUMO energies of the corresponding triazolylidene based mesoionic carbenes (MICs). Furthermore, unexpected quasi&#8208;reversiblility of the reduction of two triazoline selones, exhibiting comparable reduction potentials, was discovered. Through UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR&#8208; and EPR&#8208; spectroelectrochemical investigations supported by DFT calculations, the radical anion was unambiguously assigned to be triazoline centered. This electrochemical behavior was transferred to a triazolylidene&#8208;type gold&#8208;MIC phenyl complex resulting in a MIC&#8208;radical coordinated AuI species. Apart from UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR&#8208; and EPR spectroelectrochemical investigations of the reduction, the reduced gold coordinated MIC&#8208;radical complex was also formed in situ in the bulk through chemical reduction. This is the first report of a monodentate triazolylidene&#8208;based MIC ligand that can be reduced to its anion radical in a metal complex. The results presented here provide design principles for stabilizing radicals based on MICs.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;oxidation controlled surface pattern with responsive wrinkle and fluorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Wrinkles and photo&#8208;oxidation reactions are widely found in soft materials, which are intimately associated with the failure of materials and structures. It is expected that the photo&#8208;oxidation process will have a positive effect on the material and its surface. Here, we report the photo&#8208;oxidation of 2&#8208;(4&#8208;Dietheylaminophenyl)&#8208;4,5&#8208;bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl) imidazole (DEA&#8208;TAI) into a bilayer wrinkling system to control surface wrinkle and fluorescent pattern, in which a supramolecular polymer network composed of carboxyl acid containing copolymer (PS&#8208;BA&#8208;AA) and DEA&#8208;TAI was used as the skin layer. Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation can induce photo&#8208;oxidation of the imidazole ring of DEA&#8208;TAI to weaken the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between PS&#8208;BA&#8208;AA and DEA&#8208;TAI, resulting in the release of stress in the bilayer system. The wrinkle morphology and fluorescence of the surface can be simultaneously regulated by photo&#8208;oxidation of DEA&#8208;TAI caused by UV light, and the resulting wrinkles are extremely sensitive to pH, which can be quickly and reversibly erased by NH 3 gas. Smart surfaces with specific hierarchical wrinkles and fluorescence can be achieved by selective irradiation with photomasks, which may find potential applications in smart displays and multi&#8208;code information storage.</dc:description>

The wrinkle morphology and fluorescence of the surface can be simultaneously regulated by photo&#8208;oxidation of DEA&#8208;TAI caused by UV light, and the resulting wrinkles are extremely sensitive to pH, which can be quickly and reversibly erased by NH 3 gas. Smart surfaces with specific hierarchical wrinkles and fluorescence can be achieved by selective irradiation with photomasks, which may find potential applications in smart displays and multi&#8208;code information storage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>5&#8208;Methylcytosine Substantially Enhances the Thermal Stability of DNA Minidumbbell</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Minidumbbell (MDB) is a recently identified non&#8208;B DNA structure which has been proposed to associate with genetic instabilities.&#160; It also serves as a functional structural motif in DNA nanotechnology.&#160; DNA molecular switches constructed using MDBs show instant and complete structural conversions with easy manipulations.&#160; The availability of stable MDBs can broaden their applications.&#160; In this work, we found that substitutions of cytosine with 5&#8208;methylcytosine could lead to a significant enhancement in the thermal stabilities of MDBs.&#160; Consecutive methylations of cytosine in MDBs brought about cumulative stabilization with a drastic increase in the melting temperature by 23 &#176;C.&#160; NMR solution structures of two MDBs containing 5&#8208;methylcytosine residues have been successfully determined and revealed that the enhanced stabilities resulted primarily from favorable hydrophobic contacts, more stable base pairs and enhanced base&#8208;base stackings involving the methyl groups of 5&#8208;methylcytosine.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective Synthesis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;Tetrasubstituted Arenes by Vicinal Functionalization of Arynes Derived from Aryl(Mes)iodonium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe the synthesis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetra&#8208;substituted benzenoid rings, motifs found in pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and natural products. In the past, the regioselective syntheses of such compounds have been a significant challenge. We now report a method using substituted arynes derived from aryl(Mes)iodonium salts to access a range of densely functionalized 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted benzenoid rings. Significantly, we show that halide substituents are compatible under these conditions, enabling post&#8208;synthetic elaboration via palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling. This concise strategy is predicated on two regioselective events: 1) ortho&#8208; deprotonation of aryl(Mes)iodonium salts to generate a substituted aryne intermediate, and 2) regioselective trapping of said arynes. We have improved upon our previous reaction conditions to generate arynes at room temperature and in shorter reaction times. Density functional theory (DFT) computations and linear free energy relationship (LFER) analysis suggest the regioselectivity of deprotonation is influenced by both proximal and distal functional groups on the aryne precursor. A competition experiment further reveals the role of arene substituents on relative reactivity of aryne precursors.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A series of 9&#8208;borafluorene derivatives, functionalised with electron&#8208;donating groups, was prepared. Some of these 9&#8208;borafluorene compounds exhibit strong yellowish emission in solution and in the solid state with relative high quantum yields (up to 73.6% for  FMesB&#8208;Cz  as a neat film). Highly twisted donor groups suppress the charge transfer but the intrinsic photophysical properties of 9&#8208;borafluorene systems remain and the new compounds possess enhanced stability to the atmosphere. All of these compounds exhibit excellent thermal stability, revealing their potential for applications in materials science. OLED devices were fabricated with two of the highly emissive compounds, and they exhibit strong yellow&#8208;greenish electro&#8208;luminescence with maximum luminance intensity &gt; 22000 cd&#183;m  &#8208;2  . This is the first example of 9&#8208;borafluorene derivatives being used as light&#8208;emitting materials in OLED devices, and helps us to achieve a balance between maintaining their intrinsic properties and improving their stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid and Mild Lactamization Using Highly Electrophilic Triphosgene in a Micro&#8208;Flow Reactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lactams are cyclic amides that are indispensable as drugs and as drug candidates. Conventional lactamization includes acid&#8208;mediated approaches and coupling agent&#8208;mediated approaches that suffer from a narrow substrate scope, much waste, and/or high cost. Inexpensive, less wasteful and highly electrophilic reagent&#8208;mediated approaches are attractive, but there is an imminent risk of side reactions. Herein, we describe methods using highly electrophilic triphosgene in a micro&#8208;flow reactor that accomplish lactamization that are rapid (0.5&#8208;10 sec), mild, inexpensive, and less wasteful. We developed two methods, referred to here as A and B, using NMM and NMI, respectively. Various lactams as well as a cyclic peptide containing acid&#8208; and/or heat&#8208;labile functional groups were synthesized in good to high yields without the need for tedious purifications. Undesired reactions were successfully suppressed and the risk in handling triphosgene was minimized by the use of micro&#8208;flow technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Cationic Bismuth Aminotroponiminates: Charge Controls Redox Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Central control: A series of bismuth aminotroponiminate cations are discussed and differences between neutral and cationic compounds in terms of coordination chemistry, Lewis acidity, and redox behavior are pinpointed. Specifically, cationization allows switching from ligand&#8208;centered redox events to metal&#8208;centered redox events, facilitating rare examples of quasi&#8208;reversible electron transfer at bismuth.







Abstract
The behavior of the redox&#8208;active aminotroponiminate (ATI) ligand in the coordination sphere of bismuth has been investigated in neutral and cationic compounds, [Bi(ATI)3] and [Bi(ATI)2Ln][A] (L=neutral ligand; n=0, 1; A=counteranion). Their coordination chemistry in solution and in the solid state has been analyzed through (variable&#8208;temperature) NMR spectroscopy, line&#8208;shape analysis, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses, and their Lewis acidity has been evaluated by using the Gutmann&#8211;Beckett method (and modifications thereof). Cyclic voltammetry, in combination with DFT calculations, indicates that switching between ligand&#8208; and metal&#8208;centered redox events is possible by altering the charge of the compounds from 0 in neutral species to +1 in cationic compounds. This adds important facets to the rich redox chemistry of ATIs and to the redox chemistry of bismuth compounds, which is, so far, largely unexplored.

         <title>Regiospecific Synthesis of Calcium&#8208;Independent Daptomycin Antibiotics using a Chemoenzymatic Method</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ca not required: Daptomycin relies on calcium as an essential element for its strong antibiotic activity. Herein, a chemoenzymatic approach is used to synthesize regiospecific daptomycin derivatives that are independent of calcium and are more active than the parent drug against daptomycin&#8208;susceptible and daptomycin&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive bacteria.







Abstract
Daptomycin (DAP) is a calcium (Ca2+)&#8208;dependent FDA&#8208;approved antibiotic drug for the treatment of Gram&#8208;positive infections. It possesses a complex pharmacophore hampering derivatization and/or synthesis of analogues. To mimic the Ca2+&#8208;binding effect, we used a chemoenzymatic approach to modify the tryptophan (Trp) residue of DAP and synthesize kinetically characterized and structurally elucidated regiospecific Trp&#8208;modified DAP analogues. We demonstrated that the modified DAPs are several times more active than the parent molecule against antibiotic&#8208;susceptible and antibiotic&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. Strikingly, and in contrast to the parent molecule, the DAP derivatives do not rely on calcium or any additional elements for activity.

We demonstrated that the modified DAPs are several times more active than the parent molecule against antibiotic&#8208;susceptible and antibiotic&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. Strikingly, and in contrast to the parent molecule, the DAP derivatives do not rely on calcium or any additional elements for activity.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Structural and Electronic Control of the Bidentate 1&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)benzotriazole Ligand in Copper Chemistry with Application to Catalysis in the A3 Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precatalyst control: [CuII(OTf)2(pyb)2]2&#8201;CH3CN (1), in which pyb is 1&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)benzotriazole, enables the synthesis of a wide range of propargylamines by the A3 coupling reaction at room temperature in the absence of additives. The hybrid N,N&#8242;&#8208;bidentate pyb ligand imposes exclusive trans coordination at Cu, can rotate and modulate charge distribution and flux, thus orchestrating structural and electronic precatalyst control permitting activation of the C&#8722;H bond.







Abstract
The hybrid bidentate 1&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)benzotriazole (pyb) ligand was introduced into 3d transition metal catalysis. Specifically, [CuII(OTf)2(pyb)2]&#8901;2&#8201;CH3CN (1) enables the synthesis of a wide range of propargylamines by the A3 coupling reaction at room temperature in the absence of additives. Experimental and high&#8208;level theoretical calculations suggest that the bridging N atom of the ligand imposes exclusive trans coordination at Cu and allows ligand rotation, while the N atom of the pyridine group modulates charge distribution and flux, and thus orchestrates structural and electronic precatalyst control permitting alkyne binding with simultaneous activation of the C&#8722;H bond via a transient CuI species.

         <title>Lewis Acidic Boranes, Lewis Bases, and Equilibrium Constants: A Reliable Scaffold for a Quantitative Lewis Acidity/Basicity Scale</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Loose or Lewis? A comprehensive set of experimental equilibrium constants reveals the strength of interactions between boron&#8208;centered Lewis acids and N&#8208;, O&#8208;, S&#8208;, and P&#8208;centered Lewis bases. Data analysis shows that two&#8208;parameter Equation&#8197;(1) enables Lewis adduct formation to be straightforwardly predicted for borane/Lewis base couples. Experimental data can be supplemented by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations for a rational design of borane&#8208;catalyzed reactions.







Abstract
A quantitative Lewis acidity/basicity scale toward boron&#8208;centered Lewis acids has been developed based on a set of 90 experimental equilibrium constants for the reactions of triarylboranes with various O&#8208;, N&#8208;, S&#8208;, and P&#8208;centered Lewis bases in dichloromethane at 20&#8201;&#176;C. Analysis with the linear free energy relationship log&#8201;KB=LAB+LBB allows equilibrium constants, KB, to be calculated for any type of borane/Lewis base combination through the sum of two descriptors, one for Lewis acidity (LAB) and one for Lewis basicity (LBB). The resulting Lewis acidity/basicity scale is independent of fixed reference acids/bases and valid for various types of trivalent boron&#8208;centered Lewis acids. It is demonstrated that the newly developed Lewis acidity/basicity scale is easily extendable through linear relationships with quantum&#8208;chemically calculated or common physical&#8211;organic descriptors and known thermodynamic data (&#916;H
). Furthermore, this experimental platform can be utilized for the rational development of borane&#8208;catalyzed reactions.

         <title>Cyclo&#8208;Ketal Xanthene Dyes: A New Class of Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorophores for Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging of Live Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the emission of xanthene dye is pushed to the NIR region by replacing the 10&#8208;position O of rhodamines with a cyclo&#8208;ketal. The newly developed KRhs display intense fluorescence peaks at 700&#8197;nm (&#934;F 0.64) and, more importantly, exhibit stochastic fluorescence off&#8211;on switches to support super&#8208;resolution imaging. These KRh derivatives display great potential for fluorescence labeling and super&#8208;resolution imaging in the NIR region.







Abstract
Newly emerging super&#8208;resolution imaging techniques provide opportunities for precise observations on cellular microstructures. However, they also impose severe demands on fluorophores. Here, we develop a new series of NIR xanthene dyes, named as KRhs, by replacing the 10&#8208;position O of rhodamines with a cyclo&#8208;ketal. KRhs display an intense NIR emission peak at 700&#8197;nm with fluorescence quantum yields up to 0.64. More importantly, they, without the aid of enhancing buffer, exhibit stochastic fluorescence off&#8211;on switches to support time&#8208;resolved localization of single fluorophore. KRhs are functionalized into KRh&#8208;MitoFix, KRh&#8208;Mem and KRh&#8208;Halo that demonstrate mitochondria, plasma membrane and fusion protein targeting ability, respectively. Consequently, these KRh probes demonstrate straightforward usage for super&#8208;resolution imaging of these targets in live cells. Therefore, KRhs merit future development for fluorescence labeling and super&#8208;resolution imaging in the NIR region.

         <title>Noncovalent Helicene Structure between Nucleic Acids and Cyanuric Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel noncovalent helicene structure between nucleic acids and cyanuric acid is revealed by molecular dynamics simulations. The previously proposed hexameric rosette structure is disfavored during the simulation.







Abstract
Cyanuric acid (CA), a triazine heterocycle, is extensively utilized for noncovalent self&#8208;assembly. The association between poly(adenine) and CA into micron&#8208;length fibers was a remarkable observation made by Sleiman and co&#8208;workers, who proposed that adenine and CA adopt a hexameric rosette configuration in analogy with previously reported structures for CA assemblies. However, recent experimental observations from the Krishnamurthy group led to a reevaluation of the hexameric rosette model, wherein they have proposed a hydrogen&#8208;bonded helicene model as an alternative. Our molecular dynamics simulations show that the hexad model is indeed unlikely and that this novel noncovalent helicene geometry, where the adenine and CA bases form an extended helical hydrogen&#8208;bond network across the system, is a more probable structural motif. The existence of noncovalent helicene compounds may have wide&#8208;ranging applications in DNA nanotechnology and helicene chemistry.

         <title>Tris(pentafluoroethyl)difluorophosphorane: A Versatile Fluoride Acceptor for Transition Metal Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of titanium, nickel, and copper complexes stabilized by the weakly coordinating anion (WCA) [(C2F5)3PF3]&#8722; (FAP anion) was obtained on reaction of the parent fluoride complexes with the strong Lewis acid (C2F5)3PF2. The reaction products depend on the solvent used or additional Lewis bases present during the fluoride transfer from the metal complexes to the phosphorane.







Abstract
Fluoride abstraction from different types of transition metal fluoride complexes [LnMF] (M=Ti, Ni, Cu) by the Lewis acid tris(pentafluoroethyl)difluorophosphorane (C2F5)3PF2 to yield cationic transition metal complexes with the tris(pentafluoroethyl)trifluorophosphate counterion (FAP anion, [(C2F5)3PF3]&#8722;) is reported. (C2F5)3PF2 reacted with trans&#8208;[Ni(iPr2Im)2(ArF)F] (iPr2Im=1,3&#8208;diisopropylimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene; ArF=C6F5, 1&#8201;a; 4&#8208;CF3&#8208;C6F4, 1&#8201;b; 4&#8208;C6F5&#8208;C6F4, 1&#8201;c) through fluoride transfer to form the complex salts trans&#8208;[Ni(iPr2Im)2(solv)(ArF)]FAP (2&#8201;a&#8208;c[solv]; solv=Et2O, CH2Cl2, THF) depending on the reaction medium. In the presence of stronger Lewis bases such as carbenes or PPh3, solvent coordination was suppressed and the complexes trans&#8208;[Ni(iPr2Im)2(PPh3)(C6F5)]FAP (trans&#8208;2&#8201;a[PPh3]) and cis&#8208;[Ni(iPr2Im)2(Dipp2Im)(C6F5)]FAP (cis&#8208;2&#8201;a[Dipp2Im]) (Dipp2Im=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) were isolated. Fluoride abstraction from [(Dipp2Im)CuF] (3) in CH2Cl2 or 1,2&#8208;difluorobenzene led to the isolation of [{(Dipp2Im)Cu}2]2+2&#8201;FAP&#8722; (4). Subsequent reaction of 4 with PPh3 and different carbenes resulted in the complexes [(Dipp2Im)Cu(LB)]FAP (5&#8201;a&#8211;e, LB=Lewis base). In the presence of C6Me6, fluoride transfer afforded [(Dipp2Im)Cu(C6Me6)]FAP (5&#8201;f), which serves as a source of [(Dipp2Im)Cu)]+. Fluoride abstraction of [Cp2TiF2] (7) resulted in the formation of dinuclear [FCp2Ti(&#956;&#8208;F)TiCp2F]FAP (8) (Cp=&#951;5&#8208;C5H5) with one terminal fluoride ligand at each titanium atom and an additional bridging fluoride ligand.

Doubly inverted: Silver&#8208;promoted fluorination of &#945;&#8208;bromoamides proceeds under mild conditions via an aziridinone intermediate with double inversion of configuration. This approach can provide a variety of fluorinated products with high yield, chemoselectivity, and stereospecificity.







Abstract
Silver&#8208;promoted C&#8722;F bond formation in &#945;&#8208;bromoamides by using AgF under mild conditions is reported. This simple method enables access to tertiary, secondary, and primary alkyl fluorides involving biomolecular scaffolds. This transformation is applicable to primary and secondary amides and shows broad functional&#8208;group tolerance. Kinetics experiments revealed that the reaction rate increased in the order of 3&#176;&gt;2&#176;&gt;1&#176; &#945;&#8208;carbon atom. In addition, it was found that the acidic amide proton plays an important role in accelerating the reaction. Mechanistic studies suggested generation of an aziridinone intermediate that undergoes subsequent nucleophilic addition to form the C&#8722;F bond with stereospecificity (i.e., retention of configuration). The synthesis of sterically hindered alcohols and ethers by using AgI is also demonstrated. Examples of reactions of &#945;&#8208;bromoamides with O nucleophiles are presented.

         <title>Aerobic Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Salicylaldehydic Cformyl&#8722;H Arylations with Arylboronic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A challenging copper&#8208;catalyzed Cformyl&#8722;H arylation of salicylaldehydes with arylboronic acids has been developed. It involves unique salicylaldehydic copper species that differ from reported salicylaldehydic rhodacycles and palladacycles, as well as high chemoselectivity for Cformyl&#8722;H bond compared to the phenolic O&#8722;H bond based on copper catalysis.







Abstract
We report a challenging copper&#8208;catalyzed Cformyl&#8722;H arylation of salicylaldehydes with arylboronic acids that involves unique salicylaldehydic copper species that differ from reported salicylaldehydic rhodacycles and palladacycles. This protocol has high chemoselectivity for the Cformyl&#8722;H bond compared to the phenolic O&#8722;H bond involving copper catalysis under high reaction temperatures. This approach is compatible with a wide range of salicylaldehyde and arylboronic acid substrates, including estrone and carbazole derivatives, which leads to the corresponding arylation products. Mechanistic studies show that the 2&#8208;hydroxy group of the salicylaldehyde substrate triggers the formation of salicylaldehydic copper complexes through a CuI/CuII/CuIII catalytic cycle.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Higher Nuclearity Polyazanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chain gang: Polyazanes of up to five &#963;&#8208;bonded nitrogen atoms were prepared by sequential addition to diazo reagents. Structural analyses showed that the polynitrogen chains adopt a helical conformation maintained by the carboxyl substituents. The conformations persist in solution. Polyazanes are increasingly less reducing the more N atoms are in the chain.







Abstract
Polyazanes (i.e., higher nuclearity homologues of hydrazines) with increasing numbers of bound nitrogen atoms (from 3 to 5), including the first pentazane ever described, were prepared by the addition of lower&#8208;order polyazanes to diazo reagents. A structure was obtained. It was shown that the polynitrogen chains adopt a helical conformation. DFT modeling shows that the arrangement persists in solution. Although the polyazanes are all reducing agents, they become less so as the number of nitrogens increases.

         <title>Novel Arylindigoids by Late&#8208;Stage Derivatization of Biocatalytically Synthesized Dibromoindigo</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Indigoids represent natural product&#8208;based compounds applicable as organic semiconductors and photoresponsive materials. Yet modified indigo derivatives are difficult to access by chemical synthesis. Thus a biocatalytic approach applying several consecutive selective C&#8211;H functionalizations was developed that selectively provides access to various indigoids: Enzymatic halogenation of l&#8208;tryptophan followed by indole generation with tryptophanase yields 5&#8208;, 6&#8208; and 7&#8208;bromoindoles. Subsequent hydroxylation using a flavin monooxygenase furnishes dibromoindigo that is derivatized by acylation. This four&#8208;step one&#8208;pot cascade gives Boc&#8208;protected dibromoindigo in good isolated yields. The halogen substituent allows for late&#8208;stage diversification by cross&#8208;coupling directly performed in the crude mixture, thus enabling synthesis of 5,5&#8217;&#8208; and 6,6&#8217;&#8208;diarylindigo derivatives. This chemoenzymatic approach provides a modular platform towards novel indigoids with attractive spectral properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and ambiphilic reactivity of metalated diorgano&#8208;phosphonite boranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unprecedented metalated phosphonite boranes were prepared from PH&#8208;substituted precursors and silyl amides. While potassium derivatives were thermally stable and could even be isolated and structurally characterised, lithiated analogues proved unstable towards self&#8208;condensation under cleavage of LiOR at ambient temperature. Reaction studies revealed that the metalated phosphonite boranes exhibit ambiphilic character. Their synthetic potential as nucleophilic building blocks was demonstrated in the synthesis of the first stannylated phosphonite representing a new structural motif in phosphine chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>How the physicochemical properties of the bulk material affect the ablation crater profile, mass balance and bubble dynamics during single&#8208;pulse, nanosecond laser ablation in water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the key steps that drive the laser&#8208;based synthesis of colloids is a prerequisite for learning how to optimize the ablation process in terms of the nanoparticle output and functional design of the nanomaterials. Even though many studies focus on cavitation bubble formation using single&#8208;pulse ablation conditions, the ablation efficiency and nanoparticle properties are typically investigated under prolonged ablation conditions with repetition rate lasers. Linking single&#8208;pulse and multiple&#8208;pulse ablation is difficult due to limitations induced by gas formation cross&#8208;effects, which occur on longer timescales and depend on the target materials' oxidation&#8208;sensitivity. Therefore, this study investigates the ablation and cavitation bubble dynamics under nanosecond, single laser pulse conditions for six different bulk materials (Au, Ag, Cu, Fe, Ti, and Al). Also, the effective threshold fluences, ablation volumes and penetration depths are quantified for the these materials. The thermal and chemical properties of the corresponding bulk materials not only favor the formation of larger spot sizes but also lead to the highest molar ablation efficiencies for low melting materials such as Al. Furthermore, the concept of the cavitation bubble growth linked with the oxidation sensitivity of the ablated material is discussed. With this, evidence is provided that intensive chemical reactions occurring during the very early timescale of ablation are significantly enhanced by the bubble collapse.</dc:description>

         <title>Characterization of the Simplest Thiolimine &#8211; The Higher Energy Tautomer of Thioformamide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As sulfur containing organic molecules thioamides and their isomers are conceivable intermediates in prebiotic chemistry,  e. g.  , in the formation of amino acids and thiazoles and resemble viable candidates for detection in interstellar media. Here we report the characterization of parent thioformamide in the solid state  via  single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and its photochemical interconversion to its hitherto unreported higher energy tautomer thiolimine in inert argon and dinitrogen matrices. Upon photogeneration, four conformers of thiolimine form, whose ratio depends on the employed wavelength. One of these conformers interconverts due to quantum mechanical tunneling with a half&#8208;life of 30&#8211;45 min in both matrix materials at 3 and 20 K. A spontaneous reverse reaction from thiolimine to thioformamide is not observed. To support our experimental findings, we explored the potential energy surface of the system at the AE&#8208;CCSD(T)/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pCVTZ level of theory and computed tunneling half&#8208;lives with the CVT/SCT approach applying DFT methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrothermal&#8208;induced formation of well&#8208;defined hollow carbons with curvature&#8208;activated N&#8208;C sites for Zn&#8208;air batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;free carbons have been regarded as one of the promising materials alternative to precious metal catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), due to their high activity and stability. In this paper, well&#8208;defined N&#8208;doped hollow carbons (NHCs) are firstly achieved by an ammonia hydrothermal synthesis that are environmentally friendly and suitable for mass production in industry, using a commercial solid&#8208;type black carbon as raw material. Moreover, the shell thickness of the NHCs can be easily tuned by this hydrothermal strategy. Zn&#8208;air battery test results reveal the shell thickness&#8208;dependent activity and durability for ORR over the NHCs, which exceed that obtained by commercial Pt/C (20 wt.%, JM). The enhanced battery performance can be attributed to the curvature&#8208;activated N&#8208;C moieties on the hollow carbon surface, served as the main active sites for ORR as evidenced by DFT calculations. The proposed approach may open a way for designing curved hollow carbons with high graphitization degree and dopant nitrogen level for metal&#8208;air batteries or fuel cells.</dc:description>

         <title>The Prospect of Dimensionality in Porous Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the advent of silicon&#8208;based semiconductors, a plethora of previously unknown technologies became possible. The development of lightweight low&#8208;dimensional organic semiconductors followed soon after. However, the efficient charge/electron transfers enabled by the non&#8208;porous 3D structure of silicon is rather challenging to be realized by their (metal&#8208;)organic counterparts. Nevertheless, the demand for lighter, more efficient semiconductors is steadily increasing resulting in a growing interest in (metal&#8208;) organic semiconductors. These novel materials are faced with a variety of challenges originating from their chemical design, their packing and crystallinity. Although the effect of molecular design is quite well understood, the influence of dimensionality and the associated change in properties i.e., porosity, packing, conjugation is still an uncharted area in (metal&#8208;) organic semiconductors, yet highly important for their practical utilization. In this minireview, an overview on the design and synthesis of porous semiconductors, with a particular emphasis on organic semiconductors, is presented and the influence of dimensionality is discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational molecular design of multifunctional blue material based on phenanthroimidazole derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue emitters with EQEs over 5% are still scarce in OLEDs. In this work, by introducing the [1,2,4] triazolo [1,5&#8208;a] pyridine (TP) unit to the N1 position of phenanthroimidazole, two luminescent materials, PTPTPA and PTPBTPA were obtained. Based on systematic photophysical analysis, we found that the TP block is suitable for constructing HLCT emitters. Its moderate electron withdrawing ability and rigid planar structure can enhance the CT component while ensuring the color purity. In addition, compared with PTPTPA, the increased phenyl ring of PTPBPTA not only increases the oscillator strength, but also shortens the stokes shift. TDDFT calculations point to facile RISC processes in PTPBTPA from high&#8208;lying triplet states to the singlet excited state. PTPBTPA presents impressive performances when serving as non&#8208;doped device (EQE  max  = 7.11%, CIE: (0.15, 0.09)), as well as a high&#8208;performance host for yellow and red PhOLEDs. By doping yellow (PPYBA) and red (BTPG) phosphorescent dye into PTPBTPA, a white OLED with a high EQE of 23.85% was achieved. The successful design of PTPBTPA not only provides an optimization choice for OLED emitters, but also demonstrates the empirical rules for the design of multifunctional deep&#8208;blue emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>High temperature proton conduction in LaSbO4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lanthanum orthoantimonate was synthesized using a solid&#8208;state synthesis method. To enhance the possible protonic conductivity, samples with the addition of 1 mol% Ca in La&#8208;site, were also prepared. The structure was studied by the means of X&#8208;ray diffraction, which showed that both specimens were single phase. The materials crystallized in the space group P2  1  /n. Dilatometry revealed that material expands non&#8208;linearly with the temperature. The nature of this deviation is unknown, however, the calculated linear fraction thermal expansion coefficient was 9.56&#215;10  &#8208;6  1/K. Electrical properties studies showed that the material is a proton conductor in oxidizing conditions, which was confirmed both by temperature studies in wet in dry air, but also by the H/D isotope exchange experiment. The conductivity was rather modest, peaking at order 10  &#8208;6  S/cm at 800&#176;C, but this can be further improved by microstructure and doping optimization. This is the first time when protonic conductivity in lanthanum orthoantimonates is reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Twisting versus Delocalization in CAAC&#8208; and NHC&#8208;Stabilized Boron&#8208;Based Biradicals: The Roles of Sterics and Electronics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twist or not: A thorough computational investigation of the origin of the distinct electrostructural properties of twisted boron&#8208;based biradicals featuring unsaturated C2R2 (R=Et, Me) bridges is presented. Steric effects are mostly responsible for the preference of twisted over planar structures, while the ground state multiplicity of the twisted structure is modulated by the &#963; framework of the bridge, with different R groups leading to distinct multiplicities.







Abstract
Twisted boron&#8208;based biradicals featuring unsaturated C2R2 (R=Et, Me) bridges and stabilization by cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (CAACs) were recently prepared. These species show remarkable geometrical and electronic differences with respect to their unbridged counterparts. Herein, a thorough computational investigation on the origin of their distinct electrostructural properties is performed. It is shown that steric effects are mostly responsible for the preference for twisted over planar structures. The ground&#8208;state multiplicity of the twisted structure is modulated by the &#963; framework of the bridge, and different R groups lead to distinct multiplicities. In line with the experimental data, a planar structure driven by delocalization effects is observed as global minimum for R=H. The synthetic elusiveness of C2R2&#8208;bridged systems featuring N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) was also investigated. These results could contribute to the engineering of novel main group biradicals.

         <title>Structure&#8211;Property Relationships in Bithiophenes with Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Substituents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Side&#8208;chain engineering through hydrogen bonding: Hydrogen&#8208;bonding terminal substituents can be used as structure&#8208;directing motifs to tailor the optoelectronic properties of &#960;&#8208;conjugated materials in the solid&#8208;state. This approach has significant potential for the design of organic and polymer semiconductors.







Abstract
The use of crystal engineering to control the supramolecular arrangement of &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules in the solid&#8208;state is of considerable interest for the development of novel organic electronic materials. In this study, we investigated the effect of combining of two types of supramolecular interaction with different geometric requirements, amide hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;interactions, on the &#960;&#8208;overlap between calamitic &#960;&#8208;conjugated cores. To this end, we prepared two series of bithiophene diesters and diamides with methylene, ethylene, or propylene spacers between the bithiophene core and the functional groups in their terminal substituents. The hydrogen&#8208;bonded bithiophene diamides showed significantly denser packing of the bithiophene cores than the diesters and other known &#945;,&#969;&#8208;disubstituted bithiophenes. The bithiophene packing density reach a maximum in the bithiophene diamide with an ethylene spacer, which had the smallest longitudinal bithiophene displacement and infinite 1D arrays of electronically conjugated, parallel, and almost linear N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O=C hydrogen bonds. The synergistic hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;interactions were attributed to the favorable conformation mechanics of the ethylene spacer and resulted in H&#8208;type spectroscopic aggregates in solid&#8208;state absorption spectroscopy. These results demonstrate that the optoelectronic properties of &#960;&#8208;conjugated materials in the solid&#8208;state may be tailored systematically by side&#8208;chain engineering, and hence that this approach has significant potential for the design of organic and polymer semiconductors.

Capacitors in the cold: Although graphene fiber&#8208;based supercapacitors are promising for wearable electronic devices, their performance is limited in cold environments. Herein, porous nitrogen/sulfur dual&#8208;doped graphene fibers (NS&#8208;GFs) are synthesized by hydrothermal self&#8208;assembly followed by thermal annealing, exhibiting an excellent capacitive performance of 401&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;3 at 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;3. The all&#8208;solid&#8208;state supercapacitor assembled with NS&#8208;GF and graphene oxide exhibits a solar&#8211;thermal energy conversion of the electrolyte, extending the operating temperature range of the supercapacitor to 0&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Although graphene fiber&#8208;based supercapacitors are promising for wearable electronic devices, the low energy density of electrodes and poor cold resistance of aqueous electrolytes limit their wide application in cold environments. Herein, porous nitrogen/sulfur dual&#8208;doped graphene fibers (NS&#8208;GFs) are synthesized by hydrothermal self&#8208;assembly followed by thermal annealing, exhibiting an excellent capacitive performance of 401&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;3 at 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;3 because of the synergistic effect of heteroatom dual&#8208;doping. The assembled symmetric all&#8208;solid&#8208;state supercapacitor with polyvinyl alcohol/H2SO4/graphene oxide gel electrolyte exhibits a high capacitance of 221&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;3 and a high energy density of 7.7&#8197;mWh&#8201;cm&#8722;3 at 80&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;3. Interestingly, solar&#8211;thermal energy conversion of the electrolyte with 0.1&#8197;wt&#8201;% graphene oxide extends the operating temperature range of the supercapacitor to 0&#8201;&#176;C. Furthermore, the photocatalysis effect of the dual&#8208;doped heteroatoms increases the capacitance of NS&#8208;GFs. At an ambient temperature of 0&#8201;&#176;C, the capacitance increases from 0 to 182&#8197;F cm&#8722;3 under 1&#8197;sun irradiation because of the excellent solar light absorption and efficient solar&#8211;thermal energy conversion of graphene oxide, preventing the aqueous electrolyte from freezing. The flexible supercapacitor exhibits a long cycle life, good bending resistance, reliable scalability, and ability to power visual electronics, showing great potential for outdoor electronics in cold environments.

         <title>How to Build Prussian Blue Based Water Oxidation Catalytic Assemblies: Common Trends and Strategies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Blue is the color: Cobalt&#8208;based Prussian blue analogues (CoFe PBAs) have been established as one of the well&#8208;known non&#8208;oxide bulk water oxidation catalysts, which can operate even under harsh acidic conditions. This review presents the common synthetic strategies to enhance their catalytic activities and general trends in Prussian blue based photocatalytic, photoelectrocatalytic, and dye&#8208;sensitized photoelectrochemical assemblies.







Abstract
Prussian blue (PB) and its analogues (PBAs) have at least a three&#8208;century&#8208;long history in coordination chemistry. Recently, cobalt&#8208;based PBAs have been acknowledged as efficient and robust water oxidation catalysts. Given the flexibility in their synthesis, the structure and morphology of cobalt&#8208;based PBAs have been modified for enhanced catalytic activity under electrochemical (EC), photocatalytic (PC), and photoelectrochemical (PEC) conditions. Here, in this review, the work on cobalt&#8208;based PBAs is presented in four sections: i)&#8197;electrocatalytic water oxidation with bare PBAs, ii)&#8197;photocatalytic processes in the presence of a photosensitizer (PS), iii)&#8197;photoelectrochemical water oxidation by coupling PBAs to proper semiconductors (SCs), and iv)&#8197;the utilization of PBA&#8208;PS assemblies coated on SCs for the dye&#8208;sensitized photoelectrochemical water oxidation. This review will guide readers through the structure and catalytic activity relationship in cobalt&#8208;based PBAs by describing the role of each structural component. Furthermore, this review aims to provide insight into common strategies to enhance the catalytic activity of PBAs.

Design and use of perylene monoimide dyes: Novel perylene monoimide dyes have been synthesized, and their properties characterized by XRD, spectroscopic and electrochemical methods. A custom&#8208;made photoreactor was used to exhibit light&#8208;driven hydrogen&#8208;evolution catalysis in the presence of (NH4)2[Mo3S13] catalyst and poly(dehydroalanine)&#8208;graft&#8208;poly(ethylene glycol) solubilizing template for the organic photosensitizers.







Abstract
In this work, we present a new synthetic strategy for fourfold&#8208;substituted perylene monoimides via tetrabrominated perylene monoanhydrides. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis unveiled the intramolecular stacking orientation between the substituents and semicircular packing behavior. We observed the remarkable influence of the substituent on the longevity and nature of the excited state upon visible light excitation. In the presence of poly(dehydroalanine)&#8208;graft&#8208;poly(ethylene glycol) graft copolymers as solubilizing template, the chromophores are capable of sensitizing [Mo3S13]2&#8722; clusters in aqueous solution for stable visible light driven hydrogen evolution over three days.

Bending DNA: The structure of the non&#8208;canonical DNA duplex containing 2&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8208;BNA/LNA in the presence of AgI ions was obtained using X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Novel AgI&#8208;mediated base pairs at N1 positions of adenine, A&#8208;AgI&#8208;A, were obtained in the duplex. A highly bent duplex structure was formed at the center of AgI&#8208;mediated base pairs. This is useful for inducing large conformational change in the duplex by adding AgI ions.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;mediated base pairs have widespread applications, such as in DNA&#8208;metal nanodevices and sensors. Here, we focused on their sugar conformation in duplexes and observed the crystallographic structure of the non&#8208;canonical DNA/DNA duplex containing 2&#8242;&#8208;O,4&#8242;&#8208;C&#8208;methylene bridged nucleic acid in the presence of AgI ions. The X&#8208;ray crystallographic structure was successfully obtained at a resolution of 1.5&#8197;&#197;. A novel type of AgI&#8208;mediated base pair between the N1 positions of anti&#8208;conformation of adenines in the duplex was observed. In the central non&#8208;canonical region, a hexad nucleobase structure containing AgI&#8208;mediated base pairs between the N7 positions of guanines was formed. A highly bent non&#8208;canonical structure was formed at the origin of AgI&#8208;mediated base pairs in the central region. The bent duplex structure induced by the addition of AgI ions might become a powerful tool for dynamic structural changes in DNA nanotechnology applications.

         <dc:description>
Improved optical limiting performances: Benzothiadiazole moieties act as powerful electron&#8208;withdrawing auxiliaries enforcing the accepting character of aza&#8208;BODIPY dyes and resulting in a significant redshift of both absorption and emission and a remarkable enhancement of the nonlinear optical properties (two&#8208;photon absorption and optical limiting) compared with traditional aryl substituents.







Abstract
Aza&#8208;boron dipyrromethenes (aza&#8208;BODIPYs) presenting a benzothiadiazole substitution on upper positions are described. The strong electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of the benzothiadiazole moiety permits enhancement of the accepting strength and improves the delocalization of the aza&#8208;BODIPY core to attain a significant degree of electronic communication between the lower donating groups and the upper accepting groups. The nature of the intramolecular charge transfer is studied both experimentally and theoretically. Linear spectroscopy highlighted the strongly redshifted absorption and emission of the synthesized molecules with recorded fluorescence spectra over 1000&#8197;nm. Nonlinear optical properties were also investigated. Strong enhancement of the two&#8208;photon absorption of the substituted dyes compared with the unsubstituted one (up to 4520&#8197;GM at 1300&#8197;nm) results in an approximately 15&#8211;20&#8201;% improvement of the optical power limiting performances. These dyes are therefore a good starting point for further improvement of optical power limiting in the short&#8208;wave IR range.

         <title>Coordination Behavior of a P4&#8208;Butterfly Complex towards Transition Metal Lewis Acids: Preservation versus Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly flexible: By coordination to Lewis acids the P4 butterfly complex can preserve the initial P4 butterfly scaffold and act as a 4&#963; e&#8722; donor. However, in the presence of weakly ligated d6 metals, the P4 unit tends to rearrange. This leads to a rare octaphospha&#8208;cobalt&#8208;sandwich complex in which the P4 units have isomerized into aromatic cyclo&#8208;P4[Fe]2 units ([Fe]=Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Fe(CO)2). Additionally, also a dimerization to an all&#8208;phosphorus derivative of bicylo[3.3.0]octane is observed.







Abstract
The reactivity of the P4 butterfly complex [{Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Fe(CO)2}2(&#956;,&#951;1:1&#8208;P4)] (1, Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;=&#951;5&#8208;C5H2tBu3) towards divalent Co, Ni and Zn salts is investigated. The reaction with the bromide salts leads to [{Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Fe(CO)2}2(&#956;3,&#951;2:1:1&#8208;P4){MBr2}] (M=Co (2Co), Ni (2Ni), Zn (2Zn)) in which the P4 butterfly scaffold is preserved. The use of the weakly ligated Co complex [Co(NCCH3)6][SbF6]2, results in the formation of [{(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Fe(CO)2)2(&#956;3,&#951;4:1:1&#8208;P4)}2Co][SbF6]3 (3), which represents the second example of a homoleptic&#8208;like octaphospha&#8208;metalla&#8208;sandwich complex. The formation of the threefold positively charged complex&#8197;3 occurs via redox processes, which among others also enables the formation of [{Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Fe(CO)2}4(&#956;5,&#951;4:1:1:1:1&#8208;P8){Co(CO)2}][SbF6] (4), bearing a rare octaphosphabicyclo[3.3.0]octane unit as a ligand. On the other hand, the reaction with [Zn(NCCH3)4][PF6]2 yields the spiro complex [{(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Fe(CO)2)2(&#956;3,&#951;2:1:1&#8208;P4)}2Zn][PF6]2 (5) under preservation of the initial structural motif.

         <title>Dirhodium Complexes as Panchromatic Sensitizers, Electrocatalysts, and Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Paddlewheel dirhodium complexes have been shown to act as single&#8208;chromophore photocatalysts for H2 evolution with red/near&#8208;IR light and as electrocatalysts for the selective reduction of CO2 to HCOOH. Modification of the coordination sphere of Rh2(II,II) complexes renders them versatile candidates as homogeneous panchromatic photosensitizers, photocatalysts, and electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Dinuclear rhodium complexes are attractive candidates as homogeneous panchromatic photosensitizers and photocatalysts. Modification of the coordination sphere of the Rh2(II,II) compounds results in photophysical and redox properties that are highly desirable for electro&#8208; and photocatalysis. Specifically, Rh2(II,II) complexes have shown promising catalytic activity towards proton reduction to generate H2, a clean fuel, and for the selective reduction of CO2 to HCOOH. In addition, paddlewheel Rh2(II,II) complexes provide robust platforms for the design of efficient and stable single&#8208;component photocatalysts. Optimization of the Rh2(II,II) catalysts is crucial to realize their future application in devices or systems designed for the production of fuels from sunlight.

         <title>Ferrous to Ferric Transition in Fe&#8208;Phthalocyanine Driven by NO2 Exposure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By exploiting the FePc/Cu(100) interface, the possibility to control, via nitrogen dioxide (NO2) dissociation at the interface, the magnetic properties of the chelated ion the FePc array is demonstrated. Three different spin configurations have been stabilized within the same metalorganic/metal interface.







Abstract
Due to its unique magnetic properties offered by the open&#8208;shell electronic structure of the central metal ion, and for being an effective catalyst in a wide variety of reactions, iron phthalocyanine has drawn significant interest from the scientific community. Nevertheless, upon surface deposition, the magnetic properties of the molecular layer can be significantly affected by the coupling occurring at the interface, and the more reactive the surface, the stronger is the impact on the spin state. Here, we show that on Cu(100), indeed, the strong hybridization between the Fe d&#8208;states of FePc and the sp&#8208;band of the copper substrate modifies the charge distribution in the molecule, significantly influencing the magnetic properties of the iron ion. The FeII ion is stabilized in the low singlet spin state (S=0), leading to the complete quenching of the molecule magnetic moment. By exploiting the FePc/Cu(100) interface, we demonstrate that NO2 dissociation can be used to gradually change the magnetic properties of the iron ion, by trimming the gas dosage. For lower doses, the FePc film is decoupled from the copper substrate, restoring the gas phase triplet spin state (S=1). A higher dose induces the transition from ferrous to ferric phthalocyanine, in its intermediate spin state, with enhanced magnetic moment due to the interaction with the atomic ligands. Remarkably, in this way, three different spin configurations have been observed within the same metalorganic/metal interface by exposing it to different doses of NO2 at room temperature.

         <title>Sb6O7(SO4)2: A Promising Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Material with an Enhanced Second&#8208;Harmonic&#8208;Generation Response Activated by SbIII Lone&#8208;Pair Stereoactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Seesaw structures: An anhydrous sulfate, Sb6O7(SO4)2, featuring considerable environmental stability, is prepared through a solvent&#8208;free method. It exhibits an enhanced phase&#8208;matching second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation (SHG) response and an appropriate birefringence. Functional SbIII, with a stereochemically active lone pair, makes a predominant contribution to the enhanced SHG effect.







Abstract
The stereochemical activity of lone pairs (SCALP) in a cation favors the formation of acentric materials and can enhance the second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation (SHG) response and/or the birefringence. By introducing functional SbIII into sulfates, an anhydrous sulfate of Sb6O7(SO4)2 (1) is explored. Sb3+ cations are in seesaw configurations and in&#8208;phase aligned in a 3D asymmetric dense structure. Compound 1 exhibits an enhanced phase&#8208;matching SHG response, a moderate birefringence, a wide transparency window, and considerable environmental stabilities, which result in it being a promising UV nonlinear optical (NLO) material. Theoretical studies reveal that the stereoactive lone pairs on Sb3+ cations make the predominant contribution to the SHG effect. This work will attract more interest from scientists for research into SCALP&#8208;cation&#8208;based NLO materials.

         <title>Electro&#8208;Oxidative Selective Esterification of Methylarenes and Benzaldehydes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
P beats N: A mild and green electro&#8208;oxidative protocol to construct aromatic esters from methylarenes and alcohols is reported. Importantly, the reaction has a broad functional group tolerance and is free of metals, chemical oxidants, bases, acids, while operating at room temperature. The design of the electrolyte was found critical for the oxidation state and structure of the coupling products.







Abstract
A mild and green electro&#8208;oxidative protocol to construct aromatic esters from methylarenes and alcohols is herein reported. Importantly, the reaction is free of metals, chemical oxidants, bases, acids, and operates at room temperature. Moreover, the design of the electrolyte was found critical for the oxidation state and structure of the coupling products, a rarely documented effect. This electro&#8208;oxidative coupling process also displays exceptional tolerance of many fragile easily oxidized functional groups such as hydroxy, aldehyde, olefin, alkyne, as well as neighboring benzylic positions. The enantiomeric enrichment of some chiral alcohols is moreover preserved during this electro&#8208;oxidative coupling reaction, making it overall a promising synthetic tool.

         <title>Ni2P Interlayer and Mn Doping Synergistically Expedite the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Kinetics of Co2P</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalyst consisting of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) coral&#8208;like Mn&#8208;doped Co2P@an intermediate layer of Ni2P generated in situ by phosphorization on Ni foam (MnCoP/NiP/NF) is prepared. Note that there is an electron channel between NiP and MnCoP, electrons in Ni transfer to Co and P, which effectively weakens the strong adsorption capacity of H* and expedites the HER kinetics of Co2P.







Abstract
Transition metal phosphide is regarded as one of the most promising candidates to replace noble&#8208;metal hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts. Nevertheless, the controllable design and synthesis of transition metal phosphide electrocatalysts with efficient and stable electrochemical performance are still very challenging. Herein, a novel hierarchical HER electrocatalyst consisting of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) coral&#8208;like Mn&#8208;doped Co2P@an intermediate layer of Ni2P generated in situ by phosphorization on Ni foam (MnCoP/NiP/NF) is reported. Notably, both the incorporation of Mn and introduction of the Ni2P interlayer promote Co atoms to carry more electrons, which is beneficial to reduce the force of the Co&#8722;H bond and optimize the adsorption energy of hydrogen intermediate (|&#916;GH*|), thereby making MnCoP/NiP/NF exhibit outstanding HER performance with onset overpotential and Tafel slope as low as 31.2&#8197;mV and 61&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, respectively, in 1&#8201;m KOH electrolyte.

         <title>Iron catalyzed double bond isomerization: evidence for an Fe(I)/Fe(III) catalytic cycle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iron&#8208;catalyzed isomerization of alkenes is reported using an iron(II) &#946;&#8208;diketiminate pre&#8208;catalyst. The reaction proceeds with a catalytic amount of a hydride source, such as pinacol borane (HBpin) or ammonia borane (H 3 N&#183;BH 3 ). Reactivity with both allyl arenes and aliphatic alkenes has been studied. The catalytic mechanism was investigated by a variety of means, including deuteration studies, Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The data obtained support a pre&#8208;catalyst activation step that gives access to an &#951; 2 &#8208;coordinated alkene Fe(I) complex, followed by oxidative addition of the alkene to give an Fe(III) intermediate, which then undergoes reductive elimination to allow release of the isomerization product.</dc:description>

         <title>Helically and Linearly Fused Rylenediimide&#8208;Hexabenzocoronenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perylene&#8208; as well as naphthalenediimides were fused to hexabenzocoronenes (HBCs) at their imide position to realize highly &#960;&#8208;extended D&#8208;A&#8208;hybrids. Successful isomer separation in the first step was decisive to guarantee a straightforward synthetic sequence. Hexaphenylbenzenes (HPBs) as precursors were accessed  via  Diels&#8208;Alder reactions and reacted in a Scholl oxidation to yield the respective HBC derivatives. The fully conjugated benzimidazole linker, which separates the electron donating HBC from the electron accepting rylenediimide enables the formation of either a linear or a helical configuration. Largely different chemical, physical, and optoelectrical characteristics are noted for the two configurations. What stands out is their aggregation and their excited state deactivation depending on the solvent polarity. Results from global analysis of the femtosecond transient absorption data corroborate the formation of a charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state that is stabilized in the helically fused configuration relative to the linear analogue. But, a comparison with spectroelectrochemical experiments failed to disclose evidence for a charge&#8208;separated (CS) state.</dc:description>

         <title>Tenfold Metalation of Ferrocene: Synthesis, Structures and Metallophilic Interactions in FeC10(HgX)10</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The permercuration of ferrocene is achieved by reacting ferrocene with 10 equivalents of mercury(II) butyrate Hg(O2CC3H7)2  in a facile one&#8208;pot reaction in multi&#8208;gram scale and high yields. The butyrate groups in FeC10(HgX)10  (X = O2CC3H7) can be exchanged by treatment with trifluoro&#8208; or trichloroacetic acid (X = O2CCF3, O2CCCl3). Substitution of the trifluoroacetate groups by halides (X = Cl, F) proceeds easily in aqueous THF. The completeness of metalation was confirmed by NMR and vibrational spectroscopy, mass spectrometry as well as elemental analysis. Additionally, we present the first crystal structures of permetallated metallocenes: FeC10(HgX)10  (X = Cl, O2CCF3, O2CCCl3).</dc:description>

         <title>Dominant Pseudocapacitance Filling Charge&#8208;Discharge Voltage Gap of Flexible Hybrid Zinc&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high charge&#8208;discharge voltage gap is one of the main bottlenecks of zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) because of kinetically sluggish rate of oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) on the oxygen electrode side, and thus an efficient bifunctional catalyst for ORR and OER is highly pursued. Here, a honeycomb&#8208;like MnCo2O4.5 spheres, as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst, has been demonstrated that both ORR and OER catalytic activity are promoted by the Mn (IV) induced oxygen vacancy defects and multi&#8208;active sites. Importantly, the rich multivalent ion and defect structure endow stable pseudocapacitance within the inactive&#8208;region of ORR and OER, thus affording a low charge&#8208;discharge voltage gap (0.43 V at 10 mA cm&#8208;2) when it is employed in the flexible hybrid Zn&#8208;base battery. This mechanism provides unprecedented and valuable insights in the development of next&#8208;generation metal&#8208;air batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Photohomolysis and Photoheterolysis in Aryl Sulfonates and Aryl Phosphates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photochemistry of aryl sulfonates and phosphates (ArOX) has a role in different respects including the application in eco&#8208;sustainable arylations, in the design of innovative photoacid generators and in biological applications. However, the fate of the photoreaction depends on several factors namely the nature of the sulfonate/phosphate group, the substituents present on the aromatic ring and the polarity of the medium. Aim of this work is the photophysical investigation of selected aryl sulfonates and phosphates by laser flash photolysis experiments, to have insights on their photoreactive pathways for their possible applications. The judicious choice of the leaving group and on the nature of the substituents on the aromatic ring may lead either to a photohomolysis of the ArO&#8208;X bond or a photoheterolysis of the Ar&#8208;OX bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel ferrocene&#8208;appended &#946;&#8208;ketoimines and related BF2 derivatives with significant aggregation&#8208;induced emission and second&#8208;order nonlinear optical properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of new &#946;&#8208;ketoimines containing a ferrocene moiety and related BF&#8322; derivatives were synthesized and structurally characterized. The solvatochromism of the &#946;&#8208;ketoimines was studied, putting in evidence a red shift by increasing the solvent polarity. This positive solvatochromism can be attributed to the more polarized excited state, with respect to the ground state, due to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transitions. &#946;&#8208;ketoimines exhibit a weak emission, attributable to the excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) phenomenon. This ESIPT effect is suppressed upon restriction of the keto&#8208;enamine tautomerism by addition of BF&#8323;&#183;OEt&#8322; which affords the related BF&#8322; complexes, characterized by an enhancement of the fluorescence through the ICT effect. Both b&#8208;ketoimines and BF&#8322; complexes, examined in mixtures of CH&#8323;CN/H&#8322;O, exhibit a significant aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behavior, due to restriction of intramolecular rotation (RIR) in the aggregated state. The frontier molecular orbital levels, ground and excited state dipole moments (&#956;g and &#956;e), and the origin of electronic absorption spectra were studied by using time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations. The second&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) properties were determined by the EFISH technique. The &#956;&#946;1907 value of all &#946;&#8208;ketoimines increases upon the formation of the related BF&#8322; complex, mainly due to an enhancement of the ground state dipole moment. Some of these novel compounds are excellent multifunctional candidates for NLO and luminescence applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Combined Dynamic Kinetic Resolution and C&#8208;H Functionalization for Facile Synthesis of Non&#8208;Biaryl&#8208;Atropisomer&#8208;type Axially Chiral Organosilanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite asymmetric C&#8208;H functionalization has been available for the synthesis structurally diverse molecules, catalytic dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) approaches to change racemic stereogenic axes remain synthetically challenges in this field. Here we present a concise palladium&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution combined with C&#8208;H functionalization involving olefination and alkynylation for the highly efficient synthesis of non&#8208;biaryl&#8208;atropisomer&#8208;type (NBA) axially chiral oragnosilanes. The chemistry proceeds through two different and distinct dynamic kinetic resolutions: first, an atroposelective C&#8208;H olefination or alkynylation produced axially chiral vinylsilanes or alkynylsilanes as a new family of non&#8208;biaryl atropisomers (NBA), and second, the extension of this DKR strategy to twofold o,o'&#8208;C&#8208;H functionalization led to the multifunctional axially chiral organosilicon compounds with up to &gt;99% ee.</dc:description>

Inspired by Greek mythology, Orion is shown in the cover image as a lion&#8208;hearted hunter; he hits acyclic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated imides and N,N&#8242;&#8208;dialkylanilines with the club to give 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines (1,2,3,4&#8208;THQs; the lion fur in the cover image). There are three stars in Orion&#8242;s Belt; i.e., &#1013; Ori, &#950; Ori, and &#948; Ori, which enhance his toughness. The trio applied to the novel iridium(III) complex photo&#8208;sensitizer, the thiourea, and the azo compound, works cooperatively and powerfully to achieve the photochemical synthesis of structurally diverse 1,2,3,4&#8208;THQs with excellent diastereoselectivity. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K. Itoh, H. Fujii, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202004186).

There are three stars in Orion&#8242;s Belt; i.e., &lt;i&gt;&#1013;&lt;/i&gt; Ori, &lt;i&gt;&#950;&lt;/i&gt; Ori, and &lt;i&gt;&#948;&lt;/i&gt; Ori, which enhance his toughness. The trio applied to the novel iridium(III) complex photo&#8208;sensitizer, the thiourea, and the azo compound, works cooperatively and powerfully to achieve the photochemical synthesis of structurally diverse 1,2,3,4&#8208;THQs with excellent diastereoselectivity.

Caged: A self&#8208;assembled hybrid hydrogen&#8208;bonded/metal&#8208;coordinated cage, where both hydrogen&#8208;bonding and metal&#8208;coordination form the crucial part of the topology. The hybrid cage is prepared combining hydrogen&#8208;bonded rosette motif and palladium(II)/platinum(II) coordination to a pyridine ligand.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly of a unique molecular container is reported: a hybrid hydrogen&#8208;bonded/metal&#8208;coordinated cage where both hydrogen&#8208;bonding and metal&#8208;coordination form the crucial part of the topology. The hybrid cage was prepared combining hydrogen&#8208;bonded rosette motif and palladium(II)/platinum(II) coordination to a pyridine ligand. It was also shown that the hybrid cage could be prepared by integrative self&#8208;sorting from simple components. For the first time the genuine dual character of the hybrid cage was manifested as both self&#8208;assembling parts responded selectively to different stimuli (such as phosphine and cyanurate), which resulted in the disassembly of the cage.

         <title>Forty Years after the Discovery of Its Nucleolytic Activity: [Cu(phen)2]2+ Shows Unattended DNA Cleavage Activity upon Fluorination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activation by fluorination: By introducing fluorine&#8208;containing substituents in the 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline ligands of a [Cu(phen)2]2+ complex, nucleolytic activity in the absence of classical, bioabundant external reducing agents is observed. Such an activity is unknown for the unsubstituted [Cu(phen)2]2+, the first and otherwise one of the most efficient artificial nucleases. Also, the cytotoxicity profiles of the new complexes were different&#8212;though less toxic, cancer cells were more harmed than healthy cells.







Abstract
[Cu(phen)2]2+ (phen=1,10&#8208;phenanthroline) is the first and still one of the most efficient artificial nucleases. In general, when the phen ligand is modified, the nucleolytic activity of its CuII complex is significantly reduced. This is most likely due to higher steric bulk of such ligands and thus lower affinity to DNA. CuII complexes with phen ligands having fluorinated substituents (F, CF3, SF5, SCF3) surprisingly showed excellent DNA cleavage activity&#8212;in contrast to the unsubstituted [Cu(phen)2]2+&#8212;in the absence of the otherwise required classical, bioabundant external reducing agents like thiols or ascorbate. This nucleolytic activity correlates well with the half&#8208;wave potentials E1/2 of the complexes. Cancer cell studies show cytotoxic effects of all complexes with fluorinated ligands in the low &#956;m range, whereas they were less toxic towards healthy cells (fibroblasts).

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Chemodivergent Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Allylic Alkylation of Indoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C3 or N1? Chemodivergent regio&#8208; and enantioselective allylic alkylation of indoles was developed by using a rhodium/bisoxazolinephosphane catalyst. C3 or N1 selectivity could be selectively achieved by changing the counteranion of Rh, the allylic carbonate, the reaction temperature, and the ligand.







Abstract
The control of C3/N1 chemoselectivity in indole alkylation with the same electrophiles is still challenging. An Rh/bisoxazolinephosphane&#8208;catalyzed chemodivergent regio&#8208; and enantioselective allylic alkylation of indoles was developed. Chiral C3&#8208; and N1&#8208;allylindoles can be selectively obtained with high branched/linear ratio and up to 99&#8201;% ee by changing the counteranion of Rh, the allylic carbonate, the reaction temperature, and the ligand.

         <title>Zinc Oxide Defect Microstructure and Surface Chemistry Derived from Oxidation of Metallic Zinc: Thin&#8208;Film Transistor and Sensor Behavior of ZnO Films and Rods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thin&#8208;film transistors: Zinc oxide layers can be obtained conveniently through the oxidation of sputter&#8208;deposited thin films of zinc metal at temperatures between 250 and 450&#8201;&#176;C. Positron annihilation studies hint at vacancy clusters rather than isolated point defects as the dominating feature in the defect chemistry of these films. This allows the description of the influence of annealing temperature on the resulting electronic performance of the semiconducting layers in thin&#8208;film transistors.







Abstract
Zinc oxide thin films are fabricated by controlled oxidation of sputtered zinc metal films on a hotplate in air at temperatures between 250 and 450&#8201;&#176;C. The nanocrystalline films possess high relative densities and show preferential growth in (100) orientation. Integration in thin&#8208;film transistors reveals moderate charge carrier mobilities as high as 0.2&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1s&#8722;1. The semiconducting properties depend on the calcination temperature, whereby the best performance is achieved at 450&#8201;&#176;C. The defect structure of the thin ZnO film can be tracked by Doppler&#8208;broadening positron annihilation spectroscopy as well as positron lifetime studies. Comparably long positron lifetimes suggest interaction of zinc vacancies (VZn) with one or more oxygen vacancies (VO) in larger structural entities. Such VO&#8208;VZn defect clusters act as shallow acceptors, and thus, reduce the overall electron conductivity of the film. The concentration of these defect clusters decreases at higher calcination temperatures as indicated by changes in the S and W parameters. Such zinc oxide films obtained by conversion of metallic zinc can also be used as seed layers for solution deposition of zinc oxide nanowires employing a mild microwave&#8208;assisted process. The functionality of the obtained nanowire arrays is tested in a UV sensor device. The best results with respect to sensor sensitivity are achieved with thinner seed layers for device construction.

         <title>Twisting Versus Delocalization in CAAC&#8208; and NHC&#8208;Stabilized Boron&#8208;Based Biradicals: The Roles of Sterics and Electronics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boron chemistry offers many systems in which slight variations lead to drastic geometrical and electronic perturbations. This article explains the reasons for variations observed in a system consisting of two boron centers stabilized by CAAC or NHC donors and connected by C2R2 (R=Et, Me, H) bridges. For CAAC and R=Me, Et the bridge is twisted, and the molecule is a biradical. For CAAC and R=H the bridge is not twisted, leading to a closed&#8208;shell structure. For NHC&#8208;stabilized systems we predict closed&#8208;shell molecules with partially twisted bridges. This is attributed to a delicate interplay of steric and electronic effects.

     alt="Twisting Versus Delocalization in CAAC&#8208; and NHC&#8208;Stabilized Boron&#8208;Based Biradicals: The Roles of Sterics and Electronics"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Boron chemistry offers many systems&lt;/b&gt; in which slight variations lead to drastic geometrical and electronic perturbations. This article explains the reasons for variations observed in a system consisting of two boron centers stabilized by CAAC or NHC donors and connected by C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (R=Et, Me, H) bridges. For CAAC and R=Me, Et the bridge is twisted, and the molecule is a biradical. For CAAC and R=H the bridge is not twisted, leading to a closed&#8208;shell structure. For NHC&#8208;stabilized systems we predict closed&#8208;shell molecules with partially twisted bridges. This is attributed to a delicate interplay of steric and electronic effects.

         <title>Construction of Helical Structures with Multiple Fused Anthracenes: Structures and Properties of Long Expanded Helicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical structures are constructed by successive fusion of anthracene units in a helicene&#8208;like manner like a dragon rising in a spiral. In the derivatives with four or more anthracene units, interlayer &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions play an important role in the structures and properties of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The helical inversion occurred via multistep mechanisms at relatively high barriers. This molecular design is valuable as a new helical motif based on the expanded and conjugated &#960; systems. More information can be found in the Communication by S. Toyota et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202004720).

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered Nitric Oxide Release by a Photosensitizer to Combat Bacterial Biofilm Infections</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon light irradiation, a novel dual&#8208;functional ruthenium compound releases nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). NO induces Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm dispersal and liberates bacteria. The free&#8208;floating bacteria are subsequently sterilized by ROS. Therefore, the compound can readily eradicate mature biofilms at low concentration, which reduces cytotoxicity to mammalian cells. More information can be found in the Full Paper by Z.&#8208;W. Mao, W. Xia, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202004698).

         <title>Synthetic Processes toward Nitriles without the Use of Cyanide: A Biocatalytic Concept Based on Dehydration of Aldoximes in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrile synthesis with enzymes: An overview of a biocatalytic process technology suitable for the efficient and cyanide&#8208;free synthesis of nitriles by means of dehydration of aldoximes in water is given. A broad range of nitriles are obtained in such biotransformations. Chiral nitriles can be obtained in high enantiomeric excess. The aldoxime substrates are readily available by condensation of aldehydes with NH2OH.







Abstract
While belonging to the most fundamental functional groups, nitriles represent a class of compound that still raises challenges in terms of an efficient, cost&#8208;effective, general and, at the same time, sustainable way for their synthesis. Complementing existing chemical routes, recently a cyanide&#8208;free enzymatic process technology based on the use of an aldoxime dehydratase (Oxd) as a biocatalyst component has been developed and successfully applied for the synthesis of a range of nitrile products. In these biotransformations, the Oxd enzymes catalyze the dehydration of aldoximes as readily available substrates to the nitrile products. Herein, these developments with such enzymes are summarized, with a strong focus on synthetic applications. It is demonstrated that this biocatalytic technology has the potential to &#8220;cross the bridge&#8221; between the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals, on one hand, and bulk and commodity chemicals, on the other.

         <title>Dimesitylborylethynylated Arenes: Unique Electronic and Photophysical Properties Caused by Ethynediyl (C&#8801;C) Spacers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic hydrocarbons containing one or two dimesitylborylethynyl peripherals possess rich photophysical and electrochemical properties. The inserted ethynediyl (C&#8801;C) spacer canceled steric hindrance between the bulky dimesitylboryl groups and the aromatic rings, leading to effective &#960;&#8208;conjugation over the B&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;Ar linkages. Despite the small structural differences, the benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene derivatives showed characteristic photophysical behaviors. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K. Mishiba, Y. Tanaka, and M. Akita. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202004744).

         <title>In situ X&#8208;ray Diffraction Investigation of the Crystallisation of Perfluorinated Ce(IV)&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with UiO&#8208;66 and MIL&#8208;140 architectures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on the results of an  in situ  synchrotron powder X&#8208;ray diffraction study of the crystallisation in aqueous medium of two recently discovered perfluorinated Ce(IV)&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), analogues of the already well investigated Zr(IV)&#8208;based UiO&#8208;66 and MIL&#8208;140A, namely, F4_UiO&#8208;66(Ce) and F4_MIL&#8208;140A(Ce). The two MOFs were originally obtained in pure form in similar conditions, using ammonium cerium nitrate and tetrafluoroterephthalic acid as reagents, and small variations of the reaction parameters were found to yield mixed phases. Here, we investigate the crystallisation of these compounds, varying parameters such as temperature, amount of the protonation modulator nitric acid (HNO  3  ) and amount of the coordination modulator acetic acid (AcOH). When only HNO  3  is present in the reaction environment, only F4_MIL&#8208;140A(Ce) is obtained. Heating preferentially accelerates nucleation, which becomes rate determining below 57 &#176;C. Upon addition of AcOH to the system, alongside HNO  3  , mixed&#8208;phased products are obtained. F4_UiO&#8208;66(Ce) is always formed faster and no interconversion between the two phases occurs. In the case of F4_UiO&#8208;66(Ce), crystal growth is always the rate determining step. A higher amount of HNO  3  favours the formation of F4_MIL&#8208;140A(Ce), whereas increasing the amount of AcOH favours the formation of F4_UiO&#8208;66(Ce). Based on the  in situ  results, a new optimised route to achieving a pure, high quality F4_MIL&#8208;140A(Ce) phase in mild conditions (60 &#176;C, 1 h) is also identified.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We report on the results of an  in situ  synchrotron powder X&#8208;ray diffraction study of the crystallisation in aqueous medium of two recently discovered perfluorinated Ce(IV)&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), analogues of the already well investigated Zr(IV)&#8208;based UiO&#8208;66 and MIL&#8208;140A, namely, F4_UiO&#8208;66(Ce) and F4_MIL&#8208;140A(Ce). The two MOFs were originally obtained in pure form in similar conditions, using ammonium cerium nitrate and tetrafluoroterephthalic acid as reagents, and small variations of the reaction parameters were found to yield mixed phases. Here, we investigate the crystallisation of these compounds, varying parameters such as temperature, amount of the protonation modulator nitric acid (HNO  3  ) and amount of the coordination modulator acetic acid (AcOH). When only HNO  3  is present in the reaction environment, only F4_MIL&#8208;140A(Ce) is obtained. Heating preferentially accelerates nucleation, which becomes rate determining below 57 &#176;C. Upon addition of AcOH to the system, alongside HNO  3  , mixed&#8208;phased products are obtained. F4_UiO&#8208;66(Ce) is always formed faster and no interconversion between the two phases occurs. In the case of F4_UiO&#8208;66(Ce), crystal growth is always the rate determining step. A higher amount of HNO  3  favours the formation of F4_MIL&#8208;140A(Ce), whereas increasing the amount of AcOH favours the formation of F4_UiO&#8208;66(Ce). Based on the  in situ  results, a new optimised route to achieving a pure, high quality F4_MIL&#8208;140A(Ce) phase in mild conditions (60 &#176;C, 1 h) is also identified.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Natural and Synthetic Oligoarylamides &#8211; priviledged structures for medical applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:  The term "privileged structure" refers to a single molecular substructure or scaffold that can serve as a starting point for high&#8208;affinity ligands for more than one receptor type. In this report we are adressing a hithertho overlooked group of privileged substructures, namely aromatic oligoamides, for which there are natural models in the form of cystobactamides, albicidin, distamycin A, netropsin and others.
&#160;
The aromatic and heteroaromatic core, together with a flexible selection of substituents, form conformationally well&#8208;defined scaffolds capable of specifically binding to conformationally well&#8208;defined regions of biomacromolecules such as helices in proteins or DNA often by acting as helices mimicks themselves. As such, these aromatic oligoamides have already been employed to inhibit protein&#8208;protein and nucleic acid&#8208;protein interactions. This article is the first to bring together the scattered knowledge about aromatic oligoamides in connection with biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free N&#8208;Arylation of Amino Acid Esters with Diaryliodonium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A transition metal&#8208;free approach for the N&#8208;arylation of amino acid derivatives has been developed. Key to this method is the use of unsymmetric diaryliodonium salts with anisyl ligands, which proved important to obtain high chemoselectivity and yields. The scope includes the transfer of both electron deficient, electron rich and sterically hindered aryl groups with a variety of different functional groups. Furthermore, a cyclic diaryliodonium salt was successfully employed in the arylation. The N&#8208;arylated products were obtained with retained enantiomeric excess.</dc:description>

         <title>Calix[4]pyrrolato Aluminates: The Effect of Ligand Modification on the Reactivity of Square&#8208;Planar Aluminum Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Structural constraint represents an attractive tool to modify  p  &#8208;block element properties without the need for unusual oxidation or valence states. The recently reported methyl&#8208;calix[4]pyrrolato aluminate established the effect of forcing a tetrahedral aluminum anion into a square&#8208;planar coordination mode. However, the generality of this structural motif and any consequence of ligand modification remained open. Herein, we launch a systematic ligand screening and broaden the class of square&#8208;planar aluminum anions by two derivatives that differ in the  meso  &#8208;substitution at the calix[4]pyrrolato ligand. Strikingly, this modification provokes opposing trends in the preference for a Lewis acidic binding mode with &#963;&#8208;donors  versus  the aluminum&#8208;ligand cooperative binding mode with carbonyls. Insights into the origin of these counterintuitive experimental observations are provided by computation and bond analysis. Importantly, this rationale might allow to exploit mode&#8208;selective binding for catalytic rate control.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In this work, the electrocatalytic reduction of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2  ) into hydrocarbons involving a main group element&#8208;based molecular triazole&#8208;porphyrin electrocatalyst  H2PorT8  is reported. This catalyst converted CH2Cl2  in acetonitrile to various hydrocarbons (methane, ethane, and ethylene) with a Faradaic efficiency of 70% and current density of &#8211;13 mA/cm2  at a potential of &#8211;2.2 V vs. Fc/Fc  +  using water as a proton source. The findings of this study and its mechanistic interpretations demonstrated that  H2PorT8  was an efficient and stable catalyst for the hydrodechlorination of CH2Cl2  and that main group catalysts could be potentially used for exploring new catalytic reaction mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescent PMMA Films and PMMA@SiO2 Nanoparticles with Embedded Ln3+ Complexes for Highly Sensitive Optical Thermometers in the Physiological Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Luminescent materials doped with Ln  3+  ions have attracted in recent years a large amount of attention for their applications as optical thermometers based both on down shifting and upconversion processes. This study presents research done on development of highly sensitive optical thermometers in the physiological temperature range based on PMMA (poly(methyl methacrylate)) films doped with two series of visible Ln  3+  complexes (Ln  3+  = Tb  3+  , Eu  3+  and Sm  3+  ) and silica (SiO  2  ) nanoparticles (NPs) coated with these PMMA films. The best performing PMMA films doped with Tb  3+  and Eu  3+  complexes, was the  PMMA[TbEuL  1  tppo]1  film (L  1  = 4,4,4&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadionate and tppo = triphenylphosphine oxide), which showed good temperature sensing S  r  = 4.21% K  &#8208;1  at 313 K, while for the PMMA films doped with Tb  3+  and Sm  3+  complexes, was the  PMMA[TbSmL  2  tppo]3  film (L  2  = 4,4,4&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;1&#8208;(4&#8208;chlorophenyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadionate) showed S  r  = 3.64% K  &#8208;1  at 313 K. Additionally, SiO  2  nanoparticles coated with the best preforming films from each of the series of PMMA films (Tb&#8208;Eu and Tb&#8208;Sm) and their temperature sensing properties were studied in water showing excellent performance in the physiological temperature range (  PMMA[TbEuL  1  tppo]1@SiO  2  S  r  = 3.84% &#176;C at 20 &#176;C and  PMMA[TbSmL  2  tpp]3@SiO  2  S  r  = 3.27% &#176;C at 20 &#176;C) and the toxicity of these nanoparticles on human cells was studied showing that they are not toxic.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactions of Late First&#8208;Row Transition Metal (Fe&#8211;Zn) Dichlorides with a PGeP Pincer Germylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactivity of the PGeP germylene 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bis(di&#8208;isopropylphosphanylmethyl)&#8208;5,5&#8217;&#8208;dimethyldipyrromethane&#8208;1,1&#8217;&#8208;diylgermanium(II), Ge(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2  , with late first raw transition metal (Fe&#8211;Zn) dichlorides has been investigated. All reactions led to PGeP pincer chloridogermyl complexes. The reactions with FeCl2  and CoCl2  afforded paramagnetic square planar complexes of formula [MCl{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeCl(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}] (M = Fe, Co). While the iron complex maintains an intermediate spin state (S1; &#956;eff=3.0 &#956;B) over the temperature range 50&#8211;380 K, the cobalt complex presents a gradual spin crossover behavior (the magnetic moment varies linearly with temperature from 1.9 &#956;B  at 10 K to 3.6 &#956;B  at 380 K, the effective magnetic moment of the cobalt complex varies linearly with temperature from 1.9 &#956;B  at 10 K to 3.6 &#956;B  at 380 K, indicating a spin crossover behavior that involves  S1/2  (predominant at  T&lt;180 K) and  S3/2  (predominant at&#160;  T  &gt; 200 K). Both cobalt(II) species have been detected by EPR at  T&lt;20 K). The reaction of Ge(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2  with [NiCl2(dme)] (dme = dimethoxyethane) gave a square planar nickel(II) complex, [NiCl{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeCl(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}], whereas the reaction with CuCl2  involved a redox process that rendered a mixture of the germanium(IV) compound GeCl2(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2  and a binuclear copper(I) complex, [Cu2{&#956;&#8208;&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeCl(pyrmPi  Pr2)2CMe2}2  ], whose metal atoms are in tetrahedral environments. The reaction of the germylene with ZnCl  2  led to the tetrahedral derivative [ZnCl{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeCl(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2  }].</dc:description>

         <title>Single point mutant inverts stereoselectivity of a carbonyl reductase toward &#946;&#8208;ketoesters with enhanced activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzyme stereoselectivity control is still a major challenge. To gain insight into the molecular basis of enzyme stereo&#8208;recognition and expand the source of anti&#8208;Prelog carbonyl reductase toward  &#946;  &#8208;ketoesters, the rational design aiming at stereoselectivity inversion was performed. The designed variant Q139G switched the enzyme stereoselectivity toward  &#946;  &#8208;ketoesters from Prelog to anti&#8208;Prelog, providing corresponding alcohols in high enantiomeric purity (89.1%&#8208;99.1% ee). More importantly, the well&#8208;known trade&#8208;off between stereoselectivity and activity was not found. Q139G exhibited higher catalytic activity than the wildtype enzyme, the enhancement of the catalytic efficiency (  k  cat  /  K  m  ) varied from 1.1&#8208; to 27.1&#8208;fold. Interestingly, the mutant Q139G did not lead to reversed stereoselectivity toward aromatic ketones. Analysis of enzyme&#8208;substrate complexes showed that the structural flexibility of  &#946;  &#8208;ketoesters and a newly formed cave together facilitated the formation of the anti&#8208;Prelog&#8208;preferred conformation. In contrast, the relatively large and rigid structure of the aromatic ketones prevents them from forming the anti&#8208;Prelog&#8208;preferred conformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Properties of a Novel Indolo[3,2&#8208;b]carbazole Diradical</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work describes the synthesis and properties of a dicyanomethylene&#8208;susbtituted indolo[3,2&#8208;b]carbazole diradical  ICz&#8208;CN.This quinoidal system dimerises almost completely to (ICz&#8208;CN)2  containing two long C(sp3 )&#8208;C(sp  3) &#963;&#8208;bonds between the dicyanomethylene units . The minor open&#8208;shell ICz&#8208;CN component in the solid state mixture was identify with EPR spectroscopy. The cyclic voltammetric and UV&#8208;vis spectroelectrochemical data, and comparison with reference monomer  ICz&#8208;Br  reveal that the nature of the one&#8208;electron oxidation of (ICz&#8208;CN)2  at ambient temperature and  ICz&#8208;CN  at elevated temperature is very similar in all these compounds due to the prevailing localization of their HOMO on the  ICz  backbone. The involvement of the dicyanomethylene groups stabilizes the close&#8208;lying LUMO and LUMO+1 of (ICz&#8208;CN)  2  and especially  ICz&#8208;CN  compared to  ICz&#8208;Br  , resulting in the distinctive cathodic behaviour at low overpotentials. Differently from neutral  ICz&#8208;CN  , its radical anion and dianion are remarkably stable at ambient conditions. The UV&#8208;Vis(&#8208;NIR) electronic transitions in parent (  ICz&#8208;CN  )  2  and  ICz&#8208;CN  and their different redox forms have been assigned with the aid of TD&#8208;DFT calculations. The s&#8208;bond cleavage in neutral (  ICz&#8208;CN  )  2  is achieved in solution and in the solid&#8208;state upon soft external stimuli (time, temperature, pressure), showing a strong chromism from light yellow to blue&#8210;green. Notably, in solid state, the predominant formation of the monomeric diradical species is achieved under high hydrostatic pressure conditions (&gt;1 GPa).</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorides of silver under large compression</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The silver&#8208;fluorine phase diagram has been scrutinized as a function of external pressure using theoretical methods. Our results indicate that two novel stoichiometries containing Ag  +  and Ag  2+  cations (Ag  3  F  4  and Ag  2  F  3  ) are thermodynamically stable at ambient and low pressure. Both are computed to be magnetic semiconductors at ambient pressure conditions. For Ag  2  F  5  , containing both Ag  2+  and Ag  3+  , we find that strong 1D antiferromagnetic coupling is retained throughout the pressure&#8208;induced phase transition sequence up to 65 GPa. Our calculations show that throughout the entire pressure range of their stability the mixed valence fluorides preserve a finite band gap at the Fermi level. We also confirm the possibility of synthesizing AgF  4  as a paramagnetic compound at high pressure. Our results indicate that this compound is metallic in its thermodynamic stability region. Finally, we present general considerations on the thermodynamic stability of mixed valence compounds of silver at high pressure.</dc:description>

         <title>Separation of xylene isomers in the anion&#8208;pillared square grid material SIFSIX&#8208;1&#8209;Cu</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Xylene isomer separation is considered one of the seven separation challenges that changed the world. In addition, the high&#8208;energy demand of xylene separation highlights the need for efficient novel adsorbents. Herein, the liquid&#8208;phase separation potential of the anion&#8208;pillared hybrid material SIFSIX&#8208;1&#8208;Cu was studied for preferential adsorption of o&#8208;xylene and m&#8208;xylene over p&#8208;xylene, which was inspired by a previous complexation crystallization method for separating m&#8208;xylene. We report detailed experimental liquid&#8208;phase adsorption experiments, yielding selectivities of 3.0 for o&#8208;xylene versus p&#8208;xylene and 2.6 for m&#8208;xylene versus p&#8208;xylene. Our theoretical calculations thus provide a reasonable explanation that the xylene adsorption selectivity is attributed to the C&#8208;H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;F interaction, and the host&#8208;guest interaction order agrees with the adsorption priority: o&#8208;xylene &gt; m&#8208;xylene &gt; p&#8208;xylene.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Difunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;Diene with Amine and Disilane under a Mild Re&#8208;oxidation System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly regioselective and stereoselective difunctionalization reaction of 1,3&#8208;diene with amine and disilane to form C&#8208;N and C&#8208;Si bonds via a one&#8208;step Pd/Cu/O2 system is disclosed. The difunctionalization reaction affords allylic silanes, including the allylic amine moiety, in up to 92% yield in the absence of any acid, base, or external ligand. The developed synthetic methodology can be scaled to 100 g in high yield with high Z&#8208;selectivity, which demonstrates the feasibility of the reaction for industrial applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Nanoscale composites for high&#8208;performance electrodes employed in flexible, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state supercapacitors are being developed. A series of binder&#8208;free composites, each consisting of a transition bimetal oxide, a metal oxide, and a metal nitride grown on N&#8208;doped reduced graphene oxide (rGO)&#8208;wrapped nickel foam are obtained using a universal strategy. Three different transition metals, Co, Mo and Fe, are separately compounded with nickel ions that originate from the nickel foam to form three composites, NiCoO2@Co3O4@Co2N, NiMoO4@MoO3@Mo2N and NiFe2O4@Fe3O4@Fe2N, respectively. These as&#8208;prepared active materials have similar regular variation patterns in their properties, including better conductivity and battery&#8208;mimicking pseudocapacitance, which result in their high whole&#8208;electrode capacitance performance [2598.3 F g&#8208;1 (39.85 F cm&#8208;2), 3472.6 F g&#8208;1 (41.43 F cm&#8208;2) and 1907.5 F g&#8208;1 (3.41 F cm&#8208;2) for the composites incorporating Co, Mo and Fe, respectively].

         <title>Experimental and Computational Studies on Quadruply Bonded Dimolybdenum Complexes with Terminal and Bridging Hydride Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This contribution focuses on complex [Mo2(H)2(&#956;&#8208;AdDipp2)2] (1) and tetrahydrofuran and pyridine adducts [Mo2(H)2(&#956;&#8208;AdDipp2)2(L)2] (1&#183;thf and 1&#183;py), that contain a trans&#8208;(H)Mo&#8803;Mo(H) core (AdDipp2 = HC(NDipp2)2; Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3). Computational studies provide insights into the coordination and electronic characteristics of the central trans&#8208;Mo2H2 unit of 1, with four&#8208;coordinate, fourteen&#8208;electron Mo atoms and &#949;&#8208;agostic interactions with Dipp methyl groups. Small size C&#8208; and N&#8208;donors give rise to related complexes 1&#183;L but only one molecule of P&#8208;donors, e.g. PMe3, can bind to 1, causing one of the hydrides to form a 3c&#8208;2e Mo&#8211;HMo bond (2&#183;PMe3). A DFT analysis of the terminal and bridging hydride coordination to the Mo&#8803;Mo bond is also reported, along with reactivity studies of the Mo&#8211;H bonds of these complexes. Reactions investigated include oxidation of 1&#183;thf by silver triflimidate, AgNTf2, to afford a monohydride [Mo2(&#956;&#8208;H)(&#956;&#8208;NTf2)(&#956;&#8208;AdDipp2)2] (4), with an O,O&#8217;&#8208;bridging triflimidate ligand.</dc:description>

         <title>Metalloradical Cations and Dications Based on Divinyldiphosphene and Divinyldiarsene Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metalloradicals are key species in synthesis, catalysis, and bioinorganic chemistry. Herein, two iron radical cation complexes (  3&#8208;E  )GaCl  4  [(  3&#8208;E  )  &#8226;+  = [{(IPr)C(Ph)E}  2  Fe(CO)  3  ]  &#8226;+  , E = P or As; IPr = C{(NDipp)CH}  2  , Dipp = 2,6&#8208;  i  Pr  2  C  6  H  3  ] are reported as crystalline solids. Treatment of the divinyldipnictenes {(IPr)C(Ph)E}  2  (  1&#8208;E  ) with Fe  2  (CO)  9  affords [({(IPr)C(Ph)E}  2  )Fe(CO)  3  ] (  2&#8208;E  ), in which  1&#8208;E  binds to the Fe atom in an allylic (&#951;  3  &#8208;EEC  vinyl  ) fashion and functions as a 4e&#8208;donor ligand.  2&#8208;E  undergo 1e&#8208;oxidation with GaCl  3  to yield (  3&#8208;E  )GaCl  4  . Spin&#8208;density analysis reveals that the unpaired electron in (  3&#8208;E  )  &#8226;+  is mainly located on the Fe (52&#8208;64%) and vinylic C (30&#8208;36%) atoms. Further 1e&#8208;oxidation of (  3&#8208;E  )GaCl  4  leads to an unprecedented &#951;  3  &#8208;EEC  vinyl  to &#951;  3  &#8208;EC  vinyl  C  Ph  coordination shuttling to form the dications (  4&#8208;E  )(GaCl  4  )  2  .</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and biological activity of ferrocenyl and ruthenocenyl analogues of etoposide &#8211; discovery of a novel dual inhibitor of topoisomerase II activity and tubulin polymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two series of the ferrocenyl and ruthenocenyl analogues of etoposide bearing 1,2,3&#8208;triazolyl or aminoalkyl linker were synthesized and evaluated for their cytotoxic properties, influence on the cell cycle, ability to induce tubulin polymerization and inhibition of topoisomerase II activity. We found that the replacement of etoposide carbohydrate moiety by metallocenyl group lead to organometallic conjugates exhibiting differentiated antiproliferative activity. Biological studies demonstrated that two ferrocenylalkylamino conjugates were notably more active than etoposide with submicromolar or low&#8208;micromolar IC50  &#160;values towards SW620, etoposide&#8208;resistant SW620E and methotrexate&#8208;resistant SW620M cancer cell lines. Moreover, the simplest ferrocenylmethylamino conjugate exerted dual inhibitory action against tubulin polymerization and topoisomerase II activity while other studied compounds affected only topoisomerase II activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Directing the polymorphism in the helical nanofilament phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on the polymorphism in helical nanofilament (HNF, B  4  ) liquid crystal (LC) phase depending on the fabrication methods, here UV light&#8208;driven formation and templated assisted self&#8208;assembly in the nanoconfined geometries. As a result, uniaxially oriented HNFs with different helical structures are obtained, in which the polymorphs, twisted ribbon, and cylindrical ribbon are generated to show even molecular lattice has a different orientation. The detailed structures are directly observed using scanning electron microscopy and grazing incidence X&#8208;ray diffraction with synchrotron radiation. Our resultant polymorph would be used in the chiro&#8208;optical applications due to the capability of fine control of the helical structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Approaches to the Synthesis of Perfluoroalkyl&#8208;Modified Carbohydrates and Derivatives: thiosugars, iminosugars, and tetrahydro(thio)pyrans</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted carbohydrates play relevant roles in diverse areas such as supramolecular chemistry, glycoconjugation, liquid crystals and surfactants, with direct applications as wetting, antifreeze, and coating agents. In the light of these promising properties, new methodologies for the late&#8208;stage incorporation of fluoroalkyl R  F  groups into carbohydrates and derivatives are herein presented as they became relevant to the synthetic carbohydrate community. Previously reviewed protocols for the installation of R  F  groups onto carbohydrates and derivatives will be succinctly summarized in the light of the new achievements. Fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted iminosugars, on the other hand, are also interesting glycomimetic derivatives with prominent roles as glycosidases and glycosyltransferases inhibitors, as has recently been demonstrated. Also, they positively contribute to the study of sugar&#8208;protein interactions and enzyme mechanisms. New advances in the syntheses of fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted iminosugars will also be presented here.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure High&#8208;Temperature Synthesis of Mixed Nitridosilicatephosphates and Luminescence of AESiP3N7:Eu2+ (AE = Sr, Ba)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrahedra based nitrides with network structures have emerged as versatile materials with a broad spectrum of properties and applications. Both nitridosilicates and nitridophosphates are well&#8208;known examples of such nitrides which upon doping with Eu  2+  exhibit intriguing luminescence properties that make them attractive for applications. Nitridosilicates and nitridophosphates show manifold structural variability, however, no mixed nitridosilicatephosphates except SiPN  3  and SiP  2  N  4  NH have been described so far. The compounds  AE  SiP  3  N  7  (  AE  = Sr, Ba) were synthesized by a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature approach using the multianvil technique (8 GPa, 1400 &#8211; 1700 &#176;C) starting from the respective alkaline earth azides and the binary nitrides P  3  N  5  and Si  3  N  4  . The latter were activated by NH  4  F, probably acting as a mineralizing agent. SrSiP  3  N  7  and BaSiP  3  N  7  were obtained as single crystals. They crystallize in the barylite&#8208;1  O  (  M  = Sr) and barylite&#8208;2  O  structure types (  M  = Ba), respectively, with P and Si being occupationally disordered. Cation disorder is further supported by solid&#8208;state NMR and EDX mapping of BaSiP  3  N  7  with atomic resolution. Upon doping with Eu  2+  , both compounds show blue emission under UV excitation.</dc:description>

         <title>MODs vs NPs: vying for the future of printed electronics.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This Minireview compares two distinct ink types, namely metal&#8208;organic decomposition (MOD) or nanoparticle (NP) formulations, for use in the printing of some of the most conductive elements: silver, copper and aluminium. Printing of highly conductive features has found purpose across a broad array of electronics and as processing times and temperatures reduce, the avenues of application expand to low&#8208;cost flexible substrates, materials for wearable devices and beyond. Printing techniques such as screen, aerosol jet and inkjet printing are scalable, solution&#8208;based processes that historically have employed NP formulations to achieve low resistivity coatings printed at high resolution. Since the turn of the century, the rise in MOD inks has vastly extended the range of potentially applicable compounds that can be printed, whilst simultaneously addressing shelf life and sintering issues. A brief introduction to the field and requirements of an ink will be presented followed by a detailed discussion of a wide array of synthetic routes to both MOD and NP inks. Unindustrialized materials will be discussed, with the challenges and outlook considered for the market leaders: silver and copper, in comparison with the emerging field of aluminium inks.</dc:description>

         <title>Specific Ion&#8208;Protein Interactions Influence Bacterial Ice Nucleation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ice nucleation&#8208;active bacteria are the most efficient ice nucleators known, enabling the crystallization of water at temperatures close to 0 &#730;C, and thereby overcoming the kinetically hindered phase transition process at these conditions. Using highly&#8208;specialized ice&#8208;nucleating proteins (INPs), they can cause frost damage to plants and influence the formation of clouds and precipitation in the atmosphere. In nature, the bacteria are usually found in aqueous environments containing ions. The impact of ions on bacterial ice nucleation efficiency, however, has remained elusive. Here we demonstrate that ions can profoundly influence the efficiency of bacterial ice nucleators in a manner that follows the Hofmeister series. Weakly hydrated ions inhibit bacterial ice nucleation, whereas strongly hydrated ions apparently facilitate ice nucleation. Surface&#8208;specific sum&#8208;frequency generation spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the different effects are due to specific interactions of the ions with the INPs on the surface of the bacteria. Our results demonstrate that heterogeneous ice nucleation facilitated by bacteria is strongly dependent upon the nature of the ions, and specific ion&#8208;protein interactions are essential for the complete description of heterogeneous ice nucleation by bacteria.</dc:description>
