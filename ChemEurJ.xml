         <title>Structural Characteristics of a Partially Planarized Triarylmethyl Cation with Unsymmetrical Push&#8211;Pull Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We achieved for the first time the synthesis and isolation of the push&#8211;pull&#8208;type &#960;&#8208;cation salts with sufficient stability. The unique feature is not limited to the structure. We found that the &#960;&#8208;cation salt with planar anion exhibits panchromatic absorption in the solid state accompanying a near&#8208;infrared absorption with a &#955;onset value of 1030&#8197;nm.







Abstract
We report the physical properties of a new class of triarylmethyl&#8208;based carbocations containing both an electron&#8208;donating diphenyl ether moiety and an electron&#8208;accepting carbonyl group with a helical plane framework. Their unique packing patterns were clarified by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, which depend on the counter anions to influence their photophysical properties in the solid states. Notably, the interactions between &#960;&#8208;cation species and planar anion species lead to a unique panchromatic property, accompanying a near&#8208;infrared absorption with a &#955;onset value of 1030&#8197;nm, which can be assigned to intermolecular charge transfer transition. We found that the &#960;&#8208;cation species with planar anion formed cation dimers, being stacked in opposite directions. The two cation molecules are flanked by two anions on both the top and bottom side. Pair interaction energy decomposition analysis (PIEDA) calculations imply that the origins of the unique packing patterns of the &#960;&#8208;cations originate from the electrostatic forces of four neighbouring &#960;&#8208;anion species.

         <title>Exploring the Catalytic Potential of Bioinspired Taurine&#8208;Functionalized Carbon Quantum Dots as Bifunctional Catalysts for Diverse Sustainable Organic Transformations in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis and exploration of the catalytic potential of taurine&#8208;functionalized carbon quantum dots (Tau&#8208;CQDs) under metal&#8208;, acid&#8208;, and base&#8208;free sustainable conditions, using water as a solvent for various organic transformations, including Knoevenagel condensation, the Biginelli reaction, and the Knoevenagel&#8211;Michael cascade.







Abstract
Taurine&#8208;functionalized Carbon Quantum Dots (Tau&#8208;CQDs) were synthesized and evaluated for their catalytic potential under metal&#8208;, acid&#8208;, and base&#8208;free sustainable conditions, using water as a solvent for various organic transformations, including Knoevenagel condensation, the Biginelli reaction, and the Knoevenagel&#8211;Michael cascade. These bioinspired N, S&#8208;doped CQDs exhibit bifunctionality, acting as hydrogen bond donors and acceptors for C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, and C&#8722;O bond formation. Comprehensive characterization of the catalyst was performed using HRTEM, PXRD, XPS, FTIR, AFM, Zeta potential, UV&#8211;Vis, and photoluminescence spectrometry. The Tau&#8208;CQDs demonstrated excellent reusability, maintaining catalytic performance over 10&#8197;cycles. Green chemistry metrics, including a low E&#8208;factor, high atom economy, and favorable PMI, CE, and RME values, highlight this approach's environmental and economic advantages. Key properties, such as high reaction yields, short reaction times, water solubility, enhanced surface functionality, non&#8208;toxicity, and mild operating conditions, underscore the broader significance of Tau&#8208;CQDs as an efficient, sustainable catalytic platform. Additionally, the simple recovery of the catalyst via filtration, without the need for further purification, enhances its practical applicability.

         <title>Dehydrocoupling of Phosphine&#8208;Borane Adducts Under Ambient Conditions Using Aminoboranes as Hydrogen Acceptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aminoboranes (R2N=BH2; R = Me, Et) accept hydrogen from phosphine borane adducts (PhR&#8242;PH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH3; R&#8242; = H, Ph). This transfer is proposed to occur via a 6&#8208;membered transition state. Further, the reaction is driven forward by the reactivity of the product phosphinoborane, which undergoes subsequent addition polymerization or dimerization.







Abstract
We report on the reactivity of aminoboranes (R2N=BH2; R = iPr, Et, Me) with phosphine&#8208;borane adducts (PhR&#8242;PH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH3; R&#8242; = H, Ph): Sufficiently sterically unencumbered aminoboranes can accept hydrogen from phosphine&#8208;borane adducts. The hydrogen transfer results in the formation of amine&#8208;borane adducts (R2NH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH3) and transient phosphinoboranes (PhR&#8242;P&#8722;BH2) in&#8197;situ. These phosphinoboranes undergo subsequent reactivity to yield either polyphosphinoborane, [PhPH&#8722;BH2]n, or the linear dimer, Ph2PH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2&#8722;Ph2P&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH3. Unlike metal catalyzed phosphine&#8208;borane dehydrocoupling, which occurs at elevated temperatures (2&#8197;M, toluene, &#8805;100&#8201;&#176;C, &#8805;24&#8197;h), these dehydrocoupling reactions occur under ambient conditions (2&#8197;M, Et2O or C6D6, 20&#8201;&#176;C, &#8804;24&#8197;h). We performed a computational mechanistic study in which we identified that this transformation potentially occurs via a P&#8208;to&#8208;N and B&#8208;to&#8208;B hydrogen transfer through a 6&#8208;membered transition state.

         <title>High Performance of Cs2AgBiBr6 Perovskite&#8208;based Photodetectors by Adding DEAC</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lead&#8208;free double perovskites show promise in optoelectronics due to their optical and electrical properties. This study incorporates N&#8208;acetylethylenediamine (DEAC) into Cs2AgBiBr6 precursors, achieving photodetectors with detectivity up to 4.4&#215;1012 and excellent stability. Flexible devices also demonstrate 3.2&#215;1012 detectivity and durability. This work presents an effective approach for high&#8208;quality lead&#8208;free double perovskite films, extendable to other halide perovskites.







Abstract
Perovskite&#8208;based photodetectors (PDs) are broadly utilized in optical communication, non&#8208;destructive testing, and smart wearable devices due to their ability to convert light into electrical signals. However, toxicity and instability hold back their mass production and commercialization. The lead&#8208;free Cs2AgBiBr6 double perovskite film, promised to be an alternative, is fabricated by electrophoretic deposition (EPD), which compromises film quality. Herein, we improved the quality of the Cs2AgBiBr6 films and the performance of PDs by adding N&#8208;acetylethylenediamine (DEAC) to Cs2AgBiBr6 perovskite precursor for EPD, in which the ligand DEAC provides a pair of lone electrons to Bi3+, forming coordinate covalent bonds. The optimized PDs have high detectivity, up to 4.4&#215;1012&#8197;Jones, and high stability in the air. The high&#8208;performance, flexible Cs2AgBiBr6 perovskite PDs were fabricated on this basis, it also achieved the detectivity up to 3.2&#215;1012&#8197;Jones with excellent bending cycle stability. These results propose a feasible approach to improving the crystallization of double perovskite thin films by introducing ligands during the EPD process. Furthermore, they demonstrate enhanced optoelectronic performance, indicating that this method is also applicable to halide perovskites, offering an effective strategy to improve their film quality.

         <title>MOF Derived Cobalt Ferrite Cubic Rod&#8208;Like Materials for Highly Efficient Electrochemical Simultaneous Detection of Multiple Heavy Metal Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The MOF&#8208;derived CoFe2O4&#8208;1 material prepared by solvothermal method shows mainly a uniform cubic rod&#8208;like structure with a small amount of hexagonal structure at a Co/Fe molar ratio of 1&#8201;:&#8201;2. CoFe2O4&#8208;1/GCE exhibits excellent electrochemical detection performance in the simultaneous detection of multiple heavy metal ions (HMIs). An interaction mechanism is found to exist between HMIs when simultaneous detection.







Abstract
A series of CoFe2O4 materials derived from metal&#8208;organic framework were successfully constructed by the solvent&#8208;thermal method. The morphology of a typical sample CoFe2O4&#8208;1 was mostly in the form of a cubic rod&#8208;like structure with a size distribution of 3.2&#177;0.2&#8197;&#956;m, while a small amount of the structure presented hexagonal shape with uniform size dispersion. The XPS characterization results confirmed that the CoFe2O4&#8208;1 material contained Co3+ (Co2+/Co3+=0.98), and the redox reaction between Co2+ and Fe3+ produced more Fe2+ (Fe2+/Fe3+=1.63), leading to the production of more OV on the surface of the CoFe2O4&#8208;1 material (OV%=0.34), thereby facilitating the efficient adsorption of the efficient adsorption of heavy metal ions (HMIs). CoFe2O4&#8208;1/GCE as a typical electrode presented excellent performance for the detection of multiple HMIs. The results should be attributed to the good electrical conductivity and large electrochemically active surface area of CoFe2O4&#8208;1/GCE, accelerating the transport of ions and charges in the system. Interestingly, there are interaction mechanisms between the HMIs when performing simultaneous detection, suggesting the detection of target ions can be facilitated by adding additional ions. This study provides new research insights for the development of highly sensitive electrochemical sensors for real&#8208;time environmental monitoring.

         <title>Photoinduced Deprotection of 2&#8208;Nitrophenylneopentyl Glycol Boronates Enables Light&#8208;Triggered Polycondensation of Siloxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel photolabile protecting groups for boronic and borinic acids were developed based on the 2&#8208;nitrobenzyl motif. The 1&#8208;(2&#8208;nitrophenyl)neopentyl glycol (npnp) diol, easily synthesized on a gram scale, enables the formation of stable boronates. Efficient deprotection of RB(npnp) was achieved by irradiation at 365&#8197;nm, which was applied in light&#8208;triggered siloxane crosslinking.







Abstract
Various protecting groups have been developed for boronic acids, mostly based on diols. Alternatives include trifluoroborates and amine complexes, which offer easier synthesis and release under milder conditions. We present here a new strategy involving photocleavable protecting groups for boronic and borinic acids, based on the 2&#8208;nitrobenzyl motif. A screening of several 1,2&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;diols bearing a 2&#8208;nitrobenzyl group led us to identify 1&#8208;(2&#8208;nitrophenyl)neopentyl glycol (npnp) for the protection of boronic acid derivatives. This diol is easily prepared in a single step on gram scale, and the corresponding npnp boronates are stable in wet acetonitrile at 90&#8201;&#176;C for several days, and under under acidic conditions. Irradiation at 365&#8197;nm in acetonitrile allows for the controlled liberation of boronic acids in good to excellent yields, a method also applied to a dimesitylborinic ester bearing a 2&#8208;nitrobenzylalcohol moiety. 1&#8208;(2&#8208;Nitrophenyl)neopentyl glycol boronates ArB(npnp) demonstrated their utility in light&#8208;triggered siloxane crosslinking. We showed that catalysts incorporated into a polymer matrix, irradiated, and then incubated at 50&#8201;&#176;C for 7&#8197;days resulted in efficient polymerization, forming solid materials in some cases.

         <title>Water Microdroplets Promote Spontaneous Oxidation of Amino Acid&#8208; and Peptide&#8208;related Thiols to Disulfide Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The TOC text: Disulfide bonds play a significant role in multiple fields. This study shows thiol groups in amino acids or peptides spontaneously form disulfide bonds in water microdroplets without catalysts or oxygen. Hydroxyl radicals, originating from water microdroplets, facilitate this process, illustrating microdroplet chemistry&#8216;s potential for efficient disulfide bond formation.







Abstract
Disulfide bonds (S&#8722;S) play a critical role in modern biochemistry, organic synthesis and prebiotic chemistry. Traditional methods for synthesizing disulfide bonds often rely on oxygen, alkali, and metal catalysts. Herein, thiol groups involved in amino acids and peptides were spontaneously converted into symmetrical and unsymmetrical disulfide bonds within water microdroplets, without the need for catalysts or oxygen, and under room temperature. Water microdroplets displayed improved selectivity for disulfide bond formation, with minimal production of other oxidative species. Mechanistic investigations revealed that hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) present on the water microdroplet surface facilitated the oxidation process. Thiols were firstly oxidized to thiyl radicals (RS&#8901;), which subsequently coupled to form disulfide bonds. This study highlights the potential of microdroplet chemistry as an efficient and mild approach for constructing disulfide bonds.

         <title>Biomimetic Pseudopeptides to Decipher the Interplay between Cu and Methionine&#8208;Rich Domains in Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methionine&#8208;rich domains, unity makes strength! Tripodal pseudopeptides mimicking individual binding sites in Met&#8208;rich domains show that the trismethionine environment is highly favorable to stabilize the Cu(I) state. The moderate affinity of a single site is however amplified by efficient statistical and dynamic binding by the many methionine residues.







Abstract
Maintaining tightly copper homeostasis is crucial for the survival of all living organisms, in particular microorganisms like bacteria. They have evolved a number of proteins to capture, transport and deliver Cu(I), while avoiding Fenton&#8208;like reactions. Some Cu proteins exhibit methionine&#8208;rich (Met&#8208;rich) domains, whose role remains elusive. In this work, we designed biomimetic compounds recapitulating the possible Cu(I) binding sites in these domains, in order to examine the parameters important for Cu(I) binding. Five different biomimetic pseudopeptides were synthesized, exhibiting either three methionines or two methionines and a third amino acid likely to be present in the Met&#8208;rich domain. The affinities for Cu(I) of these model binding sites were determined, as well as their redox properties and behavior in the presence of Cu(II). Our results highlight the importance of Met residues, and their abundance in Met&#8208;rich domains, to efficiently bind Cu(I) in the periplasmic space.

     alt="Biomimetic Pseudopeptides to Decipher the Interplay between Cu and Methionine-Rich Domains in Proteins"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methionine-rich domains, unity makes strength! Tripodal pseudopeptides mimicking individual binding sites in Met-rich domains show that the trismethionine environment is highly favorable to stabilize the Cu(I) state. The moderate affinity of a single site is however amplified by efficient statistical and dynamic binding by the many methionine residues.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintaining tightly copper homeostasis is crucial for the survival of all living organisms, in particular microorganisms like bacteria. They have evolved a number of proteins to capture, transport and deliver Cu(I), while avoiding Fenton-like reactions. Some Cu proteins exhibit methionine-rich (Met-rich) domains, whose role remains elusive. In this work, we designed biomimetic compounds recapitulating the possible Cu(I) binding sites in these domains, in order to examine the parameters important for Cu(I) binding. Five different biomimetic pseudopeptides were synthesized, exhibiting either three methionines or two methionines and a third amino acid likely to be present in the Met-rich domain. The affinities for Cu(I) of these model binding sites were determined, as well as their redox properties and behavior in the presence of Cu(II). Our results highlight the importance of Met residues, and their abundance in Met-rich domains, to efficiently bind Cu(I) in the periplasmic space.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Addition and Oxidation Reactivity of a Pentacoordinate Nickelacyclobutane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of a pentacoordinate nickelacyclobutane following addition and one&#8208;electron oxidation pathways is described. Ring&#8208;opening products are observed with substrates containing a stabilizing counteranion. Pathways leading to an oxidized nickelacyclobutane yield [2+2] cycloreversion&#8208;type products, suggesting that this pathway is accessible to oxidized nickelacyclobutanes.







Abstract
Nickelacyclobutanes are reactive intermediates in catalytic cycles including cyclopropanation and insertion reactions. The stoichiometric study of these intermediates has shown that their reactivity is highly influenced by the coordination environment of the nickel center. A pentacoordinated nickelacyclobutane embedded in a diphosphine pincer ligand has been shown to selectively undergo various reactions with exogenous ligands, including [2+2] cycloreversion and carbene transfer to an isocyanide. Herein, we investigate the reactivity of the pentacoordinated nickelacyclobutane towards addition and oxidation reactions. Addition reactions lead to ring&#8208;opening to form stable square planar Ni(II) compounds, while metal oxidation enhances [2+2] cycloreversion. DFT calculations are used to shed light on the different mechanisms.

         <title>Chemically Robust Cationic Porous Organic Polymer (POP) for Selective Detection and Removal of ReO4&#8722; as a Surrogate of Radioactive 99TcO4&#8722;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient removal of highly radioactive 99TcO4&#8722; from alkaline nuclear waste remains essential for optimizing nuclear waste management and ensuring environmental protection. This study presents a urea&#8208;rich cationic porous organic polymer that exhibits ultrafast kinetics, high adsorption capacity, exceptional selectivity, and strong potential as a sensor, highlighting its effectiveness in detecting and removing 99TcO4&#8722; from nuclear wastewater.







Abstract
The efficient removal of 99TcO4&#8722; from alkaline nuclear waste is vital for optimizing nuclear waste management and safeguarding the environment. However, current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art sorbent materials are constrained by their inability to simultaneously achieve high alkali resistance, rapid adsorption kinetics, large adsorption capacity, and selectivity. In this study, we synthesized a urea&#8208;rich cationic porous organic polymer, IPM&#8208;403, which demonstrates exceptional chemical stability, ultrafast kinetics (~92&#8201;% removal within 30 seconds), high adsorption capacity (664&#8197;mg/g), excellent selectivity, along with multiple&#8208;cycle recyclability (up to 7&#8197;cycles), making it highly promising for the removal of ReO4&#8722; (surrogate of 99TcO4&#8722;) from nuclear wastewater. Notably, after exposure to 1&#8197;M NaOH solution for 24&#8197;hours, IPM&#8208;403 maintained a high adsorption capacity of 421.3&#8197;mg/g for ReO4&#8722;. Furthermore, IPM&#8208;403 acts as an efficient sensor for ReO4&#8722;, exhibiting a turn&#8208;on response and a detection limit as low as 78.8&#8197;ppb.

         <title>Advances in Chiral Macrocycles: Molecular Design and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent progress in the design and synthesis of chiral macrocycles, with a focus on their central, axial, helical, and planar chirality. These distinct chiral types impart unique structural and chiroptical properties, enabling a wide range of applications in fields such as enantioselective recognition, asymmetric catalysis, and circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
Chiral macrocycles have recently emerged as promising materials for enantioselective recognition, asymmetric catalysis, and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) due to their terminal&#8208;free structure, preorganized chiral cavities, and unique host&#8208;guest and self&#8208;assembly properties. This review summarizes recent advances in the design and synthesis of chiral macrocycles with central, axial, helical, and planar chirality, each imparting distinct structural and chiroptical characteristics. We highlight key strategies for constructing these macrocycles and their applications in optoelectronic and catalytic systems. Emphasis is placed on the balance between rigidity and flexibility in macrocycle design, essential for effective molecular recognition, adaptable catalysis, and CPL. We conclude with perspectives on future opportunities, anticipating ongoing developments in chiral macrocycle research.

         <title>Experimental Spin State Determination of Iron(II) Complexes by Hirshfeld Atom Refinement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beyond structure correlation, the spin investigation in metal complexes is an ambiguous task. We herein present a proof of concept for the experimental determination of spin states from crystal structures by using Hirshfeld atom refinement. Relying on classical crystallographic quality indicators and residual density analysis, a novel way for the differentiation between high&#8208; and low&#8208;spin is demonstrated this way.







Abstract
In this study, we present the first experimental determination of the spin state of transition metal complexes by using Hirshfeld Atom Refinement. For the demonstration, the two iron(II) complexes, (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2 &#8901; 6 H2O and lFe(pic)3jCl2 &#8901; EtOH were investigated. The method involves the refinement using wavefunctions of different spin multiplicity and comparison against experimental diffraction data by means of refinement indicators and residual electron density. Our results show a clear distinction between high&#8208;spin and low&#8208;spin configurations, even for compounds with spin&#8208;crossover behavior. The presented work demonstrates the potential of Hirshfeld Atom Refinement for the experimental determination of spin states in transition metal complexes.

         <title>Methane to Methanol Transformation on Cu2+/H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolite. Characterization of Copper State and Mechanism of the Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cu&#8208;modified zeolites provide methane conversion to methanol with high selectivity under mild conditions. The activity of different possible Cu&#8208;sites for methane transformation is still under discussion. Herein, ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite has been loaded with Cu2+ cations (1.4 wt% Cu) as characterized by UV&#8211;vis DRS, EPR, EXAFS, and 1H MAS NMR. It is inferred that Cu2+ cations, attached to the cation&#8208;exchange Al&#8211;O&#8211;&#8211;Si sites of the zeolite framework, can exist in the form of either isolated or paired Cu2+ sites. The transformation of methane to methanol on these sites has been verified by the observation of the methoxy species formation using 13C MAS NMR and FTIR spectroscopy. The related mechanisms have been analyzed by DFT calculations. It is obtained that Cu2+ sites enable heterolytic C&#8211;H bond dissociation via the &#8220;alkyl&#8221; pathway resulting in methylcopper species which however are not detected experimentally due to further rapid transformation to surface methoxy species. For the paired Cu2+ sites, such reaction occurs through methyl radical formation and recombination with Si&#8211;O&#8211;&#8211;Al site. Based on the obtained data, it has been concluded that methane transformation to methanol on Cu2+ sites, having no extra&#8208;framework oxygen ligand, is possible in Cu&#8208;modified zeolites.</dc:description>

It is inferred that Cu2+ cations, attached to the cation-exchange Al&#8211;O&#8211;&#8211;Si sites of the zeolite framework, can exist in the form of either isolated or paired Cu2+ sites. The transformation of methane to methanol on these sites has been verified by the observation of the methoxy species formation using 13C MAS NMR and FTIR spectroscopy. The related mechanisms have been analyzed by DFT calculations. It is obtained that Cu2+ sites enable heterolytic C&#8211;H bond dissociation via the &#8220;alkyl&#8221; pathway resulting in methylcopper species which however are not detected experimentally due to further rapid transformation to surface methoxy species. For the paired Cu2+ sites, such reaction occurs through methyl radical formation and recombination with Si&#8211;O&#8211;&#8211;Al site. Based on the obtained data, it has been concluded that methane transformation to methanol on Cu2+ sites, having no extra-framework oxygen ligand, is possible in Cu-modified zeolites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intermolecular 1,2&#8208;Difunctionalization of Nitriles via Redox Gold Catalysis: Synthesis of Benzoxazoles and Benzimidazoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unprecedent gold&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of nitriles with aryl iodides via Au(I)/Au(III) redox catalysis has been developed, providing an expedient route to the synthesis of benzoxazoles and benzimidazoles with broad substrate scope and high functional compatibility. Mechanistic investigation reveals that the Au(III)&#8208;Ar species generated via oxidative addition of o&#8208;iodophenol to MeDalphosAu+, serves as a key intermediate. Particularly and this annulation is initiated by oxidative addition, rather than the nucleophilic attack of the phenol moiety in o&#8208;iodophenol towards the nitrile. The method was also applied to the synthesis of poly aza&#8208;heterocycles via a cascade Au(I)/Au(III) and Au(I) catalysis relay.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we have reduced CO2 with HBpin to afford borylated methanol product selectively in ~99% yield using Ce[N(SiMe3)2]3(THF)3 as a catalyst. This led to multigram scale isolation of methanol obtained from CO2 reduction via the hydrolysis of borylated methanol, this establishes the potential of Ce[N(SiMe3)2]3(THF)3 as an efficient homogeneous catalyst for the bulk scale methanol synthesis. A practical application of this catalytic system was also shown by reducing CO2&#8208;containing motorbike exhaust efficiently and selectively. Further, C&#8210;O bond activation of esters and epoxides using HBpin and 1&#8208;2 mol% of Ce[N(SiMe3)2]3(THF)3 at 60 &#176;C afforded the borylated alcohols in good to excellent yields, which can easily be hydrolysed to the eco&#8208;friendly corresponding alcohol. The stoichiometric experiments were performed to prove the formation of in&#8208;situ generated cerium hydride [Ce]&#8208;H as an active catalyst.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An N,N,N&#8208;type Cu(&#8545;) complex&#8208;catalyzed desaturation method for converting alcohols, ketones, lactones, and lactams to their &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds is reported. The dehydrogenation reaction can be conducted with a green terminal oxidant O2 without requiring strong acid/base or stoichiometric oxidants. The Cu(&#8545;) complex/TEMPO/O2 system uses a non&#8208;noble catalyst, and a green terminal oxidant as well as demonstrates high activity and functional group tolerance. Notably, H2O is the byproduct produced and overoxidation is not observed during the reaction process.

Glassy organic dots (g&#8208;Odots) are an emerging class of bright, photostable nanoparticles owing to their rigid interior matrix. They have tunable photophysical properties, as nearly any hydrophobic dye can be used in their preparation. Pictured here is a cartoon representation of a g&#8208;Odot as well as a photo of orange&#8208;emissive g&#8208;Odots in water.

Abstract
Glassy organic dots (g&#8208;Odots) are an emerging class of luminescent nanoparticles that offer enhanced photostability, superior brightness, and modular tunability compared to other commonly employed nanoparticles. In the last several years, they have been used as bioimaging probes for single&#8208; and multi&#8208;photon cellular imaging, exhibiting low cytotoxicity even after several days. While they are emerging as promising materials for use in biological applications, g&#8208;Odots face several key challenges before their use can become widespread. In this concept, we outline the state of the literature on g&#8208;Odots and highlight a few ways in which their design and use can be improved upon.

         <title>Target Fisher: A Consensus Structure&#8208;Based Target Prediction Tool, and its Application in the Discovery of Selective MAO&#8208;B Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Target Fisher, a novel structure&#8208;based target prediction tool is introduced. It offers activity predictions for 37 targets using a consensus docking/machine learning approach. We demonstrate its application by screening a natural products library against targets relevant for neurodegenerative diseases, resulting in the discovery of three new monoamine oxidase B inhibitors. Target Fisher is available both as a stand&#8208;alone software and also via a webserver.







Abstract
In this work we introduce Target Fisher, a consensus structure&#8208;based target prediction tool that integrates molecular docking and machine learning with the aim to aid in the identification of potential biological targets and the optimization of the use of bioassays. Target Fisher uses per&#8208;residue energy decomposition profiles extracted from docking poses as fingerprints to train target&#8208;specific machine learning models. It provides predictions for a curated set of 37 protein targets, covering a diverse range of biological entities, and offers a user&#8208;friendly interface accessible via a web server (https://gqc.quimica.unlp.edu.ar/targetfisher/). In this sense, Target Fisher is a valuable tool to aid organic and medicinal chemistry groups in target identification, drug discovery and drug repurposing. As a case study, we demonstrate the efficacy of Target Fisher by screening a small library of assorted natural products for targets relevant to neurodegenerative diseases, which resulted in the identification and experimental validation of selective inhibitors of monoamine oxidase B (MAO&#8722;B).

Methods for the determination of partial orders of reaction have been surveyed and expanded. A free online application named IPLOT&#8208;VKA, after Integral&#8208;method Powell&#8208;pLOT&#8208;enhanced&#8208;Visual Kinetic Analysis, has been developed to speed up the determination of partial orders of reaction in chemical kinetics. Applications to classical teaching experiments and current literature in catalysis are reported.







Abstract
Determination of partial orders of reactions in kinetics is a general entry step for any mechanistic investigation; recently, considerable attention has been given to the benefits of using visual methods to help in this task, such as easy utilization and data&#8208;efficiency. In this respect, we here revisit and improve the classic method by Powell and Margerison for kinetic analysis. For the first time, analytical equations for a bimolecular reaction have been worked out for all values of partial orders of reactions, and the solutions have been implemented in a free, open&#8208;access and easy&#8208;to&#8208;use Web&#8208;application, named IPLOT&#8208;VKA, which also allows estimation of the errors on the kinetic constant, and residual standard error on concentrations. Several examples, taken from reference teaching experiences and from recent literature in catalysis show the efficacy and accuracy of our approach, which also has the advantage of requiring less experimental runs than other visual methods currently available.

         <title>Synthesis of &#960;&#8208;Extended [1.1]Paracyclophanes, [1.1][n]PCP (n=2, 3, and 4), and Their Through&#8208;Space Conjugation</title>

[1.1][n]Paracyclophanes ([1.1][n]PCPs) (3) with n=2, 3, and 4, which consist of two [n]paraphenylene units connected by methylene bridges, were synthesized using short synthetic pathways with good overall yields. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses reveal that the paraphenylene unit in 3 is bent, resulting in an elliptic core structure of 3. The facing bridgehead carbons of the paraphenylene units are separated by a distance much shorter than the sum of the van der Waals radii of sp2&#8208;carbon atoms. UV&#8208;vis absorption spectra, fluorescence spectra, electrochemical measurements, and theoretical calculations were used to demonstrate the presence of through&#8208;space (TS) conjugation in 3. Furthermore, host&#8208;guest complex formation between 3D (n=3) and tetracyanoquinodimethane in the solid state was revealed.

         <title>Focus on Physico&#8208;Chemical Properties of Sulfoximines: Acidity, Basicity and Lipophilicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although sulfoximines are emerging entities in chemistry, no physico&#8208;chemical are present in the literature. We disclose here a comprehensive study on the measurement of their acidity, basicity and the determination of their Hansch parameters.







Abstract
Despite the numerous published syntheses and applications of sulfoximines, very few studies describe their physico&#8208;chemical properties and in particular their acidic, basic and lipophilic or hydrophilic characters. We report for the first time the acidity values (pKa) of fluorinated sulfoximines in water and in acetonitrile, as well as the basicity (pKaH) measurements of fluorinated and non&#8208;fluorinated sulfoximines in acetonitrile. The same sulfoximine library was also studied in terms of lipophilicity with measurement of the Hansch parameters of the sulfoximine moieties. Finally, these new data allowed us to optimize the N&#8208;alkylation reaction of fluorinated sulfoximines.

         <title>Manganese(II) Porphyrin and Cumyl Hydroperoxide: An Efficient Catalyst for Aryl&#8208;Pentazole C&#8722;N Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient catalytic system composed of manganese(II) tetraphenylporphyrin and cumyl hydroperoxide was developed to afford the cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722; anion from aryl&#8208;pentazole in a 35.4&#8201;% yield over 4&#8197;hours. Mechanistic investigations revealed that Mn(IV)&#8208;oxo porphyrins and &#8901;CH3 radicals initiated C&#8722;N bond cleavage in aryl&#8208;pentazole selectively. Our findings provide a new perspective on radical&#8208;induced C&#8722;N activation for the preparation of other N&#8208;containing heterocycles.







Abstract
The selective cleavage of C&#8722;N bonds in N&#8208;containing compounds holds significant research value in organic synthesis, particularly for the synthesis of promising polynitrogen species. For instance, the discovery of the cyclo&#8208;pentazolate (cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722;) anion in 2017 as a result of cleavage of the C&#8722;N bond has sparked interest within the field of high energy density materials. However, previous methods using ferrous glycinate and m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid generated the cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722; anion in a low yield of 19.5&#8201;% after 24&#8197;hours, and the mechanism remained unclear. In this study, we developed an efficient catalytic system comprising Mn (II) tetraphenylporphyrin and cumyl hydroperoxide. This system enables the cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722; anion to be produced from 3,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxyphenylpentazole in 35.4&#8201;% yield in 4&#8197;hours. Characterization of Mn(IV)&#8208;oxo porphyrins, &#8901;CH3, and &#8901;C8H8ON5 radicals provides evidence for the mechanism whereby the cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722; anion forms. Our study underscores the competitive potential of radical&#8208;initiated selective C&#8722;N bonds cleavage in N&#8208;arylazoles and opens avenues for further exploration in this field.

Construct metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) strategy to provide three&#8208;dimensional coordination bonds network to protect the organic ligands intrinsic Hydrogen bond network. The MOF&#8208;based phosphor exhibits the suppression of the nonradiative decay of singlet and triplet excitons, from and promote the inter&#8208;system scampering and the rate of radiative decay, and achieve the long&#8208;lived room&#8208;temperature dark&#8208;blue phosphorescence.







Abstract
It is a great challenge to manufacture room&#8208;temperature blue long afterglow phosphorescent materials adapted to environmental conditions. Herein, an Na&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) was constructed using Na+ and 1H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole&#8208;3,5&#8208;dicarboxylic acid, which exhibits long&#8208;lived of 378.9&#8197;ms, deep blue and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence, meanwhile possesses the visible blue afterglow for 3~6&#8197;seconds after removing excitation light source. The three&#8208;dimensional coordination bonds network provided by Na&#8208;based MOF protects the organic ligands intrinsic hydrogen bond network, resulting in the phosphor lifetime and residual color remaining unchanged in different gas atmospheres. Furthermore, first&#8208;principles time&#8208;dependent density functional theory reveals that the rigid Na&#8208;based MOF structure can limit the rotation and vibration of the room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent organic ligands. This limitation results in the suppression of non&#8208;radiative decay for both singlet and triplet excitons, promotes intersystem crossing, and increases the rate of radiative decay, ultimately achieving long&#8208;lived room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence.

         <title>Chain&#8208;Like Pentanuclear Complexes: Syntheses, Crystal Structures and Long&#8208;Range Electronic Interactions of Cyanido&#8208;Bridged M2Ru3 (M=Fe, Ru)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
For both the pentanuclear complexes with the skeleton of [M&#8722;CN&#8722;Ru&#8722;NC&#8722;Ru&#8722;CN&#8722;Ru&#8722;NC&#8722;M] (M=Fe, 1; M=Ru, 2) reported in this work, a very strong electronic coupling exists between the two side Ru across the central NC&#8722;Ru&#8722;CN. Moreover, 1 exhibits no electronic coupling between the two terminal Fe. Upon substitution of Fe by Ru, however, 2 exhibits a long&#8208;range (20&#8197;&#197;) electronic coupling between the two terminal metal ions across the linear trinuclear cyanidometal CN&#8722;Ru&#8722;NC&#8722;Ru&#8722;CN&#8722;Ru&#8722;NC bridge.







Abstract
In this work, we report the design and synthesis of two chain&#8208;like pentanuclear cyanido&#8208;bridged complexes trans&#8208;[Ru(bpy)2(&#956;&#8208;CN)2][cis&#8208;Ru(bpy)2(&#956;&#8208;NC)M(dppe)Cp*]2[PF6]4 (M=Fe, 14+; M=Ru, 24+) and the electronic communication properties of their oxidized products 1m+ (m=6, 7, 8) and 2n+ (n=5, 6, 7, 8). The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of 1m+ (m=4, 6, 7) and 24+ show that 14+ and 24+ possess a Z&#8208;type array structure, 17+ is a U&#8208;type one, and 16+ exhibits both the types. The investigations indicate that both 1 and 2 show an extraordinarily strong electronic interaction between the two side Ru across the central NC&#8722;Ru&#8722;CN, leading to the formation of a fully delocalized cyanidometal Ru&#8722;Ru&#8722;Ru bridge for both three&#8208;electron oxidized states 17+ and 27+. Moreover, it should be noted that in 1 there exists no electronic interaction between the two terminal Fe ions. Upon substitution of Fe by Ru, however, 2 exhibits an electronic interaction between the two terminal metal ions across the trinuclear cyanidometal CN&#8722;Ru&#8722;NC&#8722;Ru&#8722;CN&#8722;Ru&#8722;NC bridge which is up to 20&#8197;&#197;.

         <title>Effect of Oriented External Electric Field in Altering Magnetic Exchange and Magnetic Anisotropy in Lanthanide&#8208;Radical Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of Oriented&#8208;External Electric Fields (OEEF) induces structural modifications capable of toggling the exchange coupling from anti&#8208;ferromagnetic to ferromagnetic in Gd&#8208;radical complex and improve the SMM performance in Dy&#8208;radical complexes.







Abstract
Magnetic exchange coupling (J) is one of the important spin Hamiltonian parameters that control the magnetic characteristics of single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs). While numerous chemical methodologies have been proposed to modify ligands and control the J value, and magneto&#8208;structural correlations have been developed accordingly, altering this parameter through non&#8208;chemical means remains a challenging task. This study explores the impact of an Oriented&#8208;External Electric Field (OEEF) on over twenty lanthanide&#8208;radical complexes using Density Functional Theory (DFT) and ab initio Complete Active Space Self&#8208;Consistent Field (CASSCF) methods. Five complexes &#8211; [{(Me3Si)2N]2Gd(THF)}2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;N2)] (1), [Gd(Hbpz3)2(dtbsq)] (2), [Gd(hfac)3(IM&#8208;2py)] (3), [Gd(hfac)3(NITBzImH)] (4), and [Gd(hfac)3{2Py&#8208;NO}(H2O)] (5) &#8211; were selected for detailed analysis, revealing significant OEEF effects on magnetic exchange interactions and structural parameters. Various parameters such as bond distances, bond angles, and torsional angles were examined as a function of OEEF to establish guiding principles for molecule selection. In complexes 1, 2, and 3, OEEF influenced torsional angles and altered exchange interactions. Complex 4 demonstrated enhanced ferromagnetic coupling under OEEF, reaching a maximum J value of +5.3&#8197;cm&#8722;1. Complex 5 reveals switching the sign of JGd&#8208;rad exchange interaction from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic under OEEF, highlighting the potential of electric fields in designing materials with tuneable magnetic properties. These findings offer valuable insights for future research and applications in advanced materials and molecular electronics.

         <title>Revisiting Butafulvene Formation by Thermal Dimerization of Fluorene&#8208;Based Dialkynes &#8208; Effects of Aromatic Substituents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dimerization of fluorene based dialkynes into planarized butafulvenes is rediscovered and its scope expanded. The stabilities of the isobenzenes involved in the formation are explored and the often proposed antiaromaticity is investigated for these near planar derivatives.







Abstract
Butafulvenes, together with pentafulvenes and [3]radialenes, form a series of constitutional benzene isomers in which aromaticity changes significantly and can be strongly substituent dependent. Butafulvene, as a member of this series, is frequently proposed to be antiaromatic. Based on butafulvenes Hopf, Zimmerman and coworkers first time described, derivatives thereof were synthesized and the effects of substituents on both the stability of the intermediate isobenzenes and on their optoelectronic and (anti)aromatic properties are discussed.

         <title>Comparative Analysis of Tetravalent Actinide Schiff Base Complexes: Influence of Donor and Ligand Backbone on Molecular Geometry and Metal Binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel tetravalent actinide (AnIV) compounds with the Schiff base ligand pyrophen, including the transuranium elements Np and Pu, are characterized in solid state and solution, as well as by quantum chemical calculations. Especially, the combination of NMR and high&#8208;level quantum chemistry for the evaluation of structure and bond properties in the actinide complexes has proven a powerful tool.







Abstract
A series of isostructural early actinide AnIV complexes was synthesized in order to investigate the influence of a conjugated framework in the ligand backbone on An bonding. Therefore, the AnIV complexes [An(pyrophen)2] (An = Th, U, Np, and Pu) with the pure N&#8211;donor ligand bis(2&#8208;pyrrolecarbonylaldehyde)&#8208;o&#8208;phenylenediamine referred to as pyrophen, were synthesized and characterized. Solid state analysis via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD) reveals two sets of ligands binding in an almost orthogonal arrangement to the actinide center. For the larger actinides Th and U, the coordination sphere allows for additional coordination by a solvent molecule. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) studies show the presence of highly symmetrical complexes in solution in good agreement with the solvent&#8208;free solid structures. While SC&#8208;XRD suggests mainly ionic binding, an analysis of paramagnetic NMR contributions and quantum chemical bond analysis hint towards significant covalency in the U, Np, and Pu compounds. This series of An complexes allowed for a thorough structural and theoretical comparison of a conjugated system to a closely related N&#8208;donor ligand (pyren),[1] as well as to the mixed N,O Schiff base ligands salophen (conjugated) and salen (non&#8208;conjugated).

         <title>Syn vs. Anti? What Controls Addition Stereochemistry in Chlorolactonization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Syn vs. anti chlorolactonization of an alkenoic acid was investigated using a deuterated analog. Product ratios (syn vs. anti) were dependent on a number of factors, although concentrations were most determinant. Kinetic analysis (Variable Time Normalized Analysis, VTNA) complemented with computational studies led to two proposed transition states that lead to the syn and anti products.







Abstract
The stereochemistry of the uncatalyzed chlorolactonization of 4&#8208;phenylpent&#8208;4&#8208;enoic acid at room temperature was examined to probe the reaction's intrinsic diastereoselectivities as a function of chlorenium ion donor, solvent polarity, and reactant concentration ranges. Kinetic studies using Variable Time Normalization Analysis (VTNA) revealed differing reaction orders for the syn and anti alkene addition processes. Aided and illustrated by quantum chemical modeling, this detailed mechanistic analysis of the substrate's intrinsic chlorolactonization reactions points to concerted AdE3&#8208;type paths for both syn and anti additions. By illuminating the factors selecting for syn&#8208; vs anti&#8208;addition paths, the results provide key reference points for future studies of stereocontrol in halofunctionalization reactions.

         <title>CoFe2O4 with the In&#8208;Situ Formed Oxygen Vacancies and Co Particles as an Efficient Bifunctional Catalyst for Rechargeable Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient bifunctional catalyst rGO&#8208;CoFe2O4/Co is synthesized by a simple hydrothermal reaction and one&#8208;step annealing process using cobalt nitrate and ferric nitrate as raw materials. The in&#8208;situ formed cobalt particles and oxygen vacancies optimize the adsorption energy of the catalyst for H2O and O2 molecules and contribute to the enhanced catalytic activity.







Abstract
Rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries (RZABs) are considered as one of the most promising clean energy device due to their abundant resources, low cost and environmental friendliness. However, their energy efficiency and cycle life are far from satisfactory due to the poor activity and stability of bi&#8208;functional electrocatalyst in air cathode. In this work, an efficient bi&#8208;functional catalyst (rGO&#8208;CoFe2O4/Co) was derived from its precursor (rGO&#8208;CoFe2O4) through a simple annealing process. Electrochemical measurements prove that rGO&#8208;CoFe2O4/Co with the in&#8208;situ formed Co nano particles and rich oxygen vacancies appears excellent oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction catalytic activity compared to its counterpart. Its half&#8208;wave potential is 0.81&#8197;V (vs RHE) and the OER overpotential is only 310&#8197;mV (vs RHE). In addition, rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries assembled with rGO&#8208;CoFe2O4/Co show the highest peak power density (128.9&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and cycling stability compared to rGO&#8208;CoFe2O4 and commercial Pt/C&#8208;RuO2 catalysts. This work provides a simple strategy for the design of advanced bifunctional catalysts.

         <title>PnictogenIII Dications Supported by BZIMPY Ligands</title>

Two homologous series of dicationic Lewis acids featuring PnIII&#8208;X (Pn = P, As, Sb, Bi; X = Cl, Ph) fragments supported by 2,6&#8208;bis(benzimidazole&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyridine (BZIMPY) ligands are described. These compounds are moderate Lewis acids and they behave as versatile PnIII transfer reagents in reactions with other Lewis bases. The salts can also be chemically and electrochemically reduced to PnI compounds.







Abstract
Two homologous series of pnictogen(III) dications, stabilized by 2,6&#8208;bis(benzimidazole&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyridine ligands have been prepared. Both series contain PnIII&#8208;X moieties (Pn = P, As, Sb, Bi; X = Cl or Ph) and have been fully characterized using spectroscopic methods including X&#8208;ray crystallography. The Lewis acidity of these compounds has also been probed by computational methods; the results suggest that the dictations are strong Lewis acids, with the PnCl2+ compounds being more acidic than the PnPh2+ compounds, and with Lewis acidity increasing from P to Bi, in both series. The PhP2+&#8208;containing compound was also found to be a versatile PIII transfer reagent, leading to new synthetic routes for various PhP&#8208;containing compounds. The redox chemistry of all compounds has also been probed using cyclic voltammetry and chemical reductions. In some cases the resulting PnI moieties could be trapped using diazabutadienes.

         <title>Influence of Pnictogen and Ligand Framework on the Lewis Acidity and Steric Environment in Pnictogen Pincer Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic structure and steric profiles of pnictogen pincer complexes from 16 ligand classes are studied computationally. The results yield insights into stereoelectronic variations both as a function of ligand and pnictogen choice, which, together with previous work on geometric variations (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202402851), provide a comprehensive understanding of this class of molecules.







Abstract
Pnictogen pincer complexes are a fascinating class of compounds due to their dynamic molecular and electronic structures, and valuable stoichiometric or catalytic reactivity. As recognition of their unique chemistry has grown, so too has the library of pincer ligands employed and pnictogen centres engaged to prepare them. Here we computationally study how the choice of pincer ligand framework and pnictogen influence the electronic and steric outcomes within the complexes obtained. The most relevant electronic parameter is the pnictogen&#8208;centred electrophilicity, which has been quantified by fluoride ion affinities and LUMO energies, while the most relevant steric parameter is the crowding around the central pnictogen, which has been quantified by the %Vbur values and visualized using steric maps. The resulting trends are analyzed with reference to binding pocket size, acceptor orbital type, electronic delocalization, &#960;&#8208;donor strengths, and heteroatom incorporation. Thus, considering 16 ligand frameworks and 4 heavy pnictogen centres, this study provides a broad&#8208;spectrum view of stereo&#8208;electronic variation in pnictogen pincer complexes, which, together with a recent study on geometric variation in the same family, provides a substantial dataset to guide future molecular design and reactivity studies.

&lt;p&gt;The electronic structure and steric profiles of pnictogen pincer complexes from 16 ligand classes are studied computationally. The results yield insights into stereoelectronic variations both as a function of ligand and pnictogen choice, which, together with previous work on geometric variations (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202402851"&gt;10.1002/chem.202402851&lt;/a&gt;), provide a comprehensive understanding of this class of molecules.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pnictogen pincer complexes are a fascinating class of compounds due to their dynamic molecular and electronic structures, and valuable stoichiometric or catalytic reactivity. As recognition of their unique chemistry has grown, so too has the library of pincer ligands employed and pnictogen centres engaged to prepare them. Here we computationally study how the choice of pincer ligand framework and pnictogen influence the electronic and steric outcomes within the complexes obtained. The most relevant electronic parameter is the pnictogen-centred electrophilicity, which has been quantified by fluoride ion affinities and LUMO energies, while the most relevant steric parameter is the crowding around the central pnictogen, which has been quantified by the %V&lt;sub&gt;bur&lt;/sub&gt; values and visualized using steric maps. The resulting trends are analyzed with reference to binding pocket size, acceptor orbital type, electronic delocalization, &#960;-donor strengths, and heteroatom incorporation. Thus, considering 16 ligand frameworks and 4 heavy pnictogen centres, this study provides a broad-spectrum view of stereo-electronic variation in pnictogen pincer complexes, which, together with a recent study on geometric variation in the same family, provides a substantial dataset to guide future molecular design and reactivity studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regio&#8208;, Site&#8208; and Stereo&#8208;Selective Aziridination of Conjugated Dienes Enabled by Palladium/Copper/Iodide/Oxygen Cooperation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed aerobic 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of conjugated dienes has been developed to achieve regio&#8208;, site&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selective aziridination under the synergistic effects of PdII, CuI, I&#8722;, and O2. A series of vinylaziridines were synthesised using tosyl&#8208;protected amine as the nitrogen source and oxygen as the terminal oxidant. Mechanistic studies reveal that a &#960;&#8208;allyl&#8208;palladium species undergoes an unusual iodination to form an allyl iodide, followed by an intramolecular SN2&#8242; substitution to yield the vinylaziridine product.







Abstract
Vinylaziridines are important building blocks in organic chemistry, especially in the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles. The direct and efficient transfer of an appropriate nitrogen source to readily accessible conjugated dienes is a notable methodology. The Pd&#8208;catalyzed oxidative 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of conjugated dienes through a &#960;&#8208;allyl&#8208;palladium species should be an ideal method for the selective synthesis of vinylaziridines. However, this method faces the challenge of regioselectivity, often resulting in 1,4&#8208;difunctionalization instead. In this study, we developed a Pd&#8208;catalyzed aerobic 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of conjugated dienes via a &#960;&#8208;allyl&#8208;palladium species to achieve regio&#8208;, site&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selective aziridination under the synergistic effects of PdII, CuI, I&#8722;, and O2. The &#960;&#8208;allyl palladium species formed in the system undergoes an unusual iodination process, leading to the formation of an allyl iodide intermediate. Subsequently, the vinylaziridine is obtained through intramolecular SN2&#8242; substitution of the allyl iodide.

         <title>A Combined Experimental and Computational Exploration of Heteroleptic cis&#8208;Pd2L2L&#8217;2 Coordination Cages through Geometric Complementarity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calculations based on ligand geometries and computed energies of coordination assemblies were compared against experimental results working towards rationalising the self&#8208;assembly of heteroleptic Pd2L2L&#8217;2&#8208;type coordination cages. Valuable insights into the use and limitations of the approaches examined were gained in the continued development of high&#8208;throughput methods to aid molecular design.







Abstract
Heteroleptic (mixed&#8208;ligand) coordination cages are of interest as host systems with more structurally and functionally complex cavities than homoleptic architectures. The design of heteroleptic cages, however, is far from trivial. In this work, we experimentally probed the self&#8208;assembly of Pd(II) ions with binary ligand combinations in a combinatorial fashion to search for new cis&#8208;Pd2L2L&#8217;2 heteroleptic cages. A hierarchy of computational analyses was then applied to these systems with the aim of elucidating key factors for rationalising self&#8208;assembly outcomes. Simple and inexpensive geometric analyses were shown to be effective in identifying complementary ligand pairs. Preliminary results demonstrated the viability of relatively rapid semi&#8208;empirical calculations for predicting the topology of thermodynamically favoured assemblies with rigid ligands, whilst more flexible systems proved challenging. Stemming from this, key challenges were identified for future work developing effective computational forecasting tools for self&#8208;assembled metallo&#8208;supramolecular systems.

         <title>Construction of a Fluorinated&#8208;Anion Pillared Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Exhibiting Dual&#8208;Pore Architecture for Simultaneous Enhancement of C2H2 Adsorption Capacity and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel fluorinated&#8208;anion pillared metal&#8208;organic framework (APMOF) featuring a dual&#8208;pore architecture has been successfully constructed. This framework demonstrates exceptional C2H2 adsorption capacity and C2H2/CO2 separation selectivity, effectively balancing the trade&#8208;off between adsorption capacity and selectivity.







Abstract
Physisorption&#8208;based separation processes represents a promising alternative to the conventional thermally driven methods, such as cryogenic separation. However, a significant challenge lies in balancing the trade&#8208;off between adsorption capacity and selectivity of adsorbents. In this study, we introduce a novel fluorinated&#8208;anion pillared metal&#8208;organic frameworks (APMOFs) featuring a dual&#8208;pore architecture, constructed using a pyridine&#8208;oxazole bifunctional ligand. The inherent low symmetry of the ligand leads to significant distortion of the fluorinated&#8208;anion pillars, resulting in a distinctive type of APMOFs characterized by dual&#8208;pore architecture. On pore structure with constrict pore width is enriched with a high density of anion fluorinated pillars, offering numerous active sites advantageous for enhancing separation selectivity. Concurrently, the other pore structure exhibits larger dimensions, facilitating increased gas molecule accommodation and thereby augmenting adsorption capacity. Gas sorption studies reveal a substantial C2H2 adsorption capacity and a high C2H2/CO2 separation selectivity. Breakthrough experiments confirm its exceptional separation performance, while theoretical investigations elucidate a sequential adsorption process within these APMOFs, underscoring the efficacy of this strategy in overcoming trade&#8208;off limits in adsorbents.

         <title>Pure Shift NMR in Continuous Flow</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pure shift NMR provides highly resolved spectra that are very useful for the analysis of mixtures. Standard pure shift NMR methods are, however, not compatible with sample motion, and thus with the broad range of applications that involve a flowing sample. We show that high quality pure shift NMR spectra can be obtained for a continuously flowing sample, and illustrate the approach with the online monitoring of a tosylation reaction.







Abstract
Flow NMR is an expanding analytical approach with applications that include in&#8208;line analysis for process control and optimisation, and real&#8208;time reaction monitoring. The samples monitored by flow NMR are typically mixtures that yield complex 1D 1H spectra. &#8220;Pure shift&#8221; NMR is a powerful approach to simplifying 1H NMR spectra, but its standard implementation is not compatible with continuous flow because of interference between sample motion and the position&#8208;dependent spin manipulations that are required in pure shift NMR. Here we show that pure shift NMR spectra can be successfully collected for continuously flowing samples, thanks to an adapted acquisition scheme, robust solvent suppression, and a velocity&#8208;compensation strategy. The resulting method is used to collect ultrahigh resolution reaction monitoring data. Pure shift NMR spectra are expected to benefit many applications of flow NMR.

The samples monitored by flow NMR are typically mixtures that yield complex 1D &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H spectra. &#8220;Pure shift&#8221; NMR is a powerful approach to simplifying &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR spectra, but its standard implementation is not compatible with continuous flow because of interference between sample motion and the position-dependent spin manipulations that are required in pure shift NMR. Here we show that pure shift NMR spectra can be successfully collected for continuously flowing samples, thanks to an adapted acquisition scheme, robust solvent suppression, and a velocity-compensation strategy. The resulting method is used to collect ultrahigh resolution reaction monitoring data. Pure shift NMR spectra are expected to benefit many applications of flow NMR.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Skeletal Isomerization of Ergosterol&#8208;5,8&#8208;Peroxide Leading to the Discovery of Unprecedented Ergostanes and Collective Syntheses of 5,6&#8208;Epoxysterols and (+)&#8208;Sarocladione</title>

         <dc:description>
Oxidative metabolic pathways of ergosterol via a 5,8&#8208;peroxy intermediate were explored through chemical synthesis. This research not only facilitated access to rare sterols found in mushrooms but also led to the discovery of an unusual tricyclic ergostane and elucidation of a biosynthetic pathway for a structurally complex natural product. Additionally, some of the sterols were found to inhibit the aggregation and deposition of amyloid &#946;.







Abstract
Skeletal isomerization of ergosterol peroxide, a primary oxidation product of ergosterol, was investigated under thermal and iron(II)&#8208;mediated conditions. Thermal isomerization resulted in not only the isolation of the predicted 7&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;5,6&#8208;epoxides but also the discovery of the unprecedented 7/9/5&#8208;ring&#8208;fused ergostane for the first time. The iron(II)&#8208;mediated isomerization proceeded at ambient temperature, resulting in the formation of the expected 5,6&#8208;epoxysterols and a ring&#8208;opened bicyclic diketone. The diketone was further converted into novel ergostane under thermal conditions and into (+)&#8208;sarocladione under acidic conditions. All transformations from ergosterol to sarocladione, including the isolation of the unstable diketone intermediate, were achieved at ambient temperature, confirming the biosynthetic pathway of sarocladione. Several mushroom ingredients with a 5,6&#8208;epoxy group were synthesized stereoselectively from the isomerization products, leading to the confirmation or revision of the structures of natural products. The &#946;&#8208;amyloid aggregation inhibitory activity of synthetic sterols was evaluated for the first time to gain insights into the potential for dementia prevention. This study is valuable both for supplying rare sterols found in mushrooms for biological studies and for shedding light on the oxidative metabolic pathways of ergosterol.

         <title>An Ultrahigh Affinity DNA Aptamer for Quinine and Its Intrinsic Fluorescence Based Label&#8208;Free Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrahigh affinity DNA aptamer for quinine was obtained using capture&#8208;SELEX, and it did not bind to cocaine. In comparison to the prior MN4 aptamer, the new aptamer has 70&#8208;fold better affinity with a different way of binding to quinine.







Abstract
Measuring quinine is critical for the detection of its overdose, understanding its pharmacological and toxicological effects, and monitoring its pollution. While a previously reported aptamer named MN4 can bind quinine, it was not selected for it, leading to compromised binding affinity and specificity. In this work, a new quinine aptamer was isolated using the library immobilization capture&#8208;SELEX technique. The Q1 aptamer has a Kd value of 10&#8197;nM determined by an isothermal titration calorimetry experiment and 45&#8197;nM in a fluorescence binding assay. A 3.5&#8197;nM quinine limit of detection was obtained based on the aptamer binding&#8208;induced quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence of quinine. A large blue shift in fluorescence was observed for quinine upon binding to Q1, whereas binding to MN4 led to a very small red shift, indicating different ways of quinine binding by these two aptamers. Q1 did not bind cocaine based on NMR spectroscopy and fluorescence assays also indicated excellent selectivity against other tested molecules. This work has supplied a high affinity aptamer for quinine that can be useful for its detection and fundamental aptamer binding studies. It also highlights the advantages of using capture&#8208;SELEX to isolate aptamers for small molecules.

A ZAB with Co&#8211;N&#8211;C&#8211;PBMCRO cathodic catalyst achieves a remarkable cycling stability for 788&#8197;h. The perovskite Pr0.5Ba0.5Mn0.8Co0.1Ru0.1O2.5+&#948; (PBMCRO) composite was constructed by in situ exsolved CoRu nanoparticles and Co&#8211;N&#8211;C with more exposing active sites. A conductive pathway for oxygen ions and electrons was built, thereby enhancing the electrochemical bifunctional properties. This rational design strategy shows great potential for facilitating synthesis of perovskite based catalysts for energy conversion and storage applications.







Abstract
Bifunctional catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are essential components of rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries. In this study, we synthesized a Pr0.5Ba0.5Mn0.8Co0.1Ru0.1O2.5+&#948; (PBMCRO) perovskite composite with in&#8197;situ exsolved CoRu nanoparticles and Co&#8211;N&#8211;C, functioning as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for zinc&#8208;air batteries. The in&#8197;situ exsolution of CoRu nanoparticles from the perovskite oxide was facilitated by the reducing action of 2&#8208;methylimidazole (2&#8208;MIM). Concurrently, Co&#8211;N&#8211;C was used to decorate PBMCRO, forming a novel bifunctional composite electrode of Co&#8211;N&#8211;C&#8211;PBMCRO. The incorporation of CoRu nanoparticles introduces a significant number of electrochemically active oxygen vacancies in the perovskite matrix, enhancing ORR and OER performance. Additionally, the Co&#8211;N&#8211;C synergistically improves electrochemical activity while preserving the structural stability of the perovskite oxide. The prepared Co&#8211;N&#8211;C&#8211;PBMCRO catalyst demonstrates significantly enhanced bifunctional performance compared to the undecorated pristine perovskite Pr0.5Ba0.5MnO3&#8722;&#948; (PBMO). The zinc&#8208;air battery with Co&#8211;N&#8211;C&#8211;PBMCRO catalyst achieve a peak power density of approximately 90&#8197;mW/cm2 and exhibit remarkable cycling stability for 788&#8197;h. This study presents a novel and effective strategy to enhance the catalytic performance of perovskite&#8208;based air electrodes for rechargeable metal&#8208;air batteries.

Gluconolactone, readily derived from glucose, is transformed into a versatile hydroxymethyl furanoic ester in two steps. The reactions are catalyzed by either acid or base. The key intermediate from the base&#8208;catalyzed elimination has been studied in detail and found to serve as a versatile platform for the synthesis of highly functionalized molecules.







Abstract
Gluconolactone serves as a readily available and inexpensive starting material for synthesizing the potential platform chemical (Z)&#8208;3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;1,2&#8201;:&#8201;5,6&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;isopropylidene&#8208;D&#8208;erythro&#8208;hex&#8208;3&#8208;enolactone in two steps. In this work, the selective elimination of triacetone gluconolactone was optimized. The resulting product is a versatile molecule, capable of being transformed into various compound classes in one or a few steps, i.&#8201;e. potentially a new biomass&#8208;based platform chemical. This study demonstrates how it can be transformed into furanics, rare sugars, &#946;&#8208;ketoamides, and amino furanones.

&lt;p&gt;Gluconolactone serves as a readily available and inexpensive starting material for synthesizing the potential platform chemical (Z)-3-deoxy-1,2&#8201;:&#8201;5,6-di-O-isopropylidene-D-erythro-hex-3-enolactone in two steps. In this work, the selective elimination of triacetone gluconolactone was optimized. The resulting product is a versatile molecule, capable of being transformed into various compound classes in one or a few steps, i.&#8201;e. potentially a new biomass-based platform chemical. This study demonstrates how it can be transformed into furanics, rare sugars, &#946;-ketoamides, and amino furanones.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Contorted Polycyclic Aromatic Compounds via Alkyne Benzannulation on Zigzag&#8208;Edged Dibenzochrysene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report the use of alkyne benzannulation on zigzag&#8208;edged dibenzochrysene derivatives to extend the conjugation and reduce their bandgap. Unexpectedly, the ring closure reaction takes place at the most sterically hindered positions (peri to the substituent) to yield contorted polycyclic compounds. Moreover, both TIPS&#8208;acetylene&#8208;functionalized dibenzochrysene derivatives underwent a tandem dearomative spirocyclization to form bent polycyclic compounds.







Abstract
Organic dyes are interesting building blocks for the preparation of organic semiconductors as they possess synthetic handles that can be used to functionalize them and, consequently, change their electronic properties. However, reactions to extend their &#960;&#8208;conjugated framework through ring annulation have only been scarcely tested. Herein, we report the use of alkyne benzannulation on 2,8&#8208;dibromo&#8208;dibenzo[def,mno]chrysene (vat orange 3) and 2,9&#8208;dibromo&#8208;dibenzo[b,def]chrysene (vat orange 1) to extend the conjugation and reduce their bandgap. Unexpectedly, the ring closure reaction takes place at the most sterically hindered positions (peri to the substituent) to yield contorted polycyclic compounds. More surprisingly, both TIPS&#8208;acetylene&#8208;functionalized derivatives underwent a tandem dearomative spirocyclization to form bent polycyclic compounds. Absorption spectroscopy reveals that ring annulation on both 2,9&#8208;dibromo&#8208;dibenzo[b,def]chrysene and 2,8&#8208;dibromo&#8208;dibenzo[def,mno]chrysene resulted in a decrease of 0.38 and 0.12&#8197;eV in bandgap values, respectively, despite inducing a contorted conformation.

         <title>C(sp2)&#8208;Arylsulfones Directly from Arylsulfonyl Chlorides with Boronic Acids by Photoactivation of Boosted EDA Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
With a reinforced EDA complex platform, the visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated synthesis of C(sp2)&#8208;arylsulfones directly from commercially available arylsulfonyl chlorides and boronic acids at room temperature under photocatalyst&#8208;free conditions was demonstrated, featuring broad substrate scopes, simple operation, accessibility of raw materials and ease of scale&#8208;up.







Abstract
Directly with arylsulfonyl chlorides, a green and efficient deborylativesulfonylation of aryl(alkenyl)boronic acids has been developed to access both diarylsulfones and vinylarylsulfones in moderate to excellent yields at room temperature under visible&#8208;light irradiation. This protocol features broad C(sp2)&#8208;arylsulfone applicability, simple operation, accessibility of raw materials and ease of scale&#8208;up. The key to the success of this photoredox transformation is introducing catalytic amounts of additives, naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ols, thus boosting the formed electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes, which can dramatically improve not only the reaction efficiency but also the selectivity. This strategy was inspired and derived from specific substrates, representing a rare paradigm of how to exploit a more general reaction system. Moreover, extensive control experiments provide insights into the proposed mechanism.

         <title>O&#8208;p&#8208;Methoxyphenyl &#945;&#8208;Hydroxycarboxylic Acids as Versatile Hydroxyalkylation Agents for Photocatalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
Heteroatom&#8208;stabilized radicals are useful building blocks for photocatalysis. Despite the intensive research on &#945;&#8208;amino radicals, &#945;&#8208;hydroxy radicals have never received comparable attention. Herein we present O&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenyl (PMP) &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylic acids as easy to prepare, bench&#8208;stable and synthetically highly flexible radical precursors. Next to their synthesis, we describe their application in five different photocatalytic reactions.







Abstract
Reliable radical precursors are crucial for photocatalytic processes. In particular, heteroatom&#8208;stabilized radicals have attracted considerable research interest in photocatalysis. Among them, &#945;&#8208;amino radicals have received the most attention, while the research on &#945;&#8208;hydroxy radicals is much less developed. Herein, we present O&#8208;PMP &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylic acids as novel precursors for the formation of oxygen&#8208;stabilized radicals. These radicals have been successfully used as building blocks in Pd&#8208;catalyzed allylation reactions, Ni&#8208;catalyzed arylation and alkenylation reactions, and Giese reactions. A subsequent deprotection step liberates the corresponding hydroxyalkylation products.

Photo&#8208;triggered ROS&#8208;responsive supramolecular nanoprodrugs (BNN6@GBTC NPs) were constructed through the self&#8208;assembly of the amphiphilic prodrug molecule (GBTC) and NO donor (BNN6) in water for targeted and synergistic chemo/photodynamic/gas therapy.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;triggered ROS&#8208;responsive supramolecular nanoprodrugs (BNN6@GBTC NPs) are constructed via supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic prodrug molecule (GBTC) and NO donor (BNN6). BNN6@GBTC NPs possess good stability, ROS responsiveness, and selective HepG2 cells targetability via overexpressed galactose receptors on the cell membrane. When BNN6@GBTC NPs are taken up by HepG2 cells, they can generate ROS upon light irradiation, which can not only be used for photodynamic therapy, but also cleave the thioketal linkage to release camptothecin for chemotherapy. Meanwhile, BNN6 triggering release NO for gas therapy. BNN6@GBTC NPs enable targeted and synergistic chemo/photodynamic/gas therapy, which results in reduced damage to normal cells and enhanced anti&#8208;cancer efficacy in&#8197;vitro. This work provides a novel approach for the design of nanoprodrugs based on supramolecular self&#8208;assembly to achieve the multimodal synergistic anti&#8208;cancer therapy.

Two new non&#8208;centrosymmetric chalcogenides, ACuGa6S10 (A = Rb, Cs) have been successfully synthesized by an &#8220;iterative substitution&#8221; strategy based on chalcopyrite CuFeS2 structural template. ACuGa6S10 (A = Rb, Cs) exhibit wide suitable band gap of 2.48 and 2.40&#8197;eV, respectively, and a large second harmonic generation response (1.5 and 1.8&#215;AgGaS2).

Benefiting from the substitution of Fe3+ cations by Ga3+ cations, ACuGa6S10 (A = Rb, Cs) exhibit wide suitable band gap of 2.48 and 2.40&#8197;eV, respectively, which is about five times higher than their structure template CuFeS2, and a large second harmonic generation response (1.5 and 1.8&#215;AgGaS2). Combining theoretical calculation and structural analysis confirms that the [GaS4] tetrahedra make the main contribution on their good liner and nonlinear optical (NLO) performances. The &#8220;iterative substitution&#8221; strategy expands the design idea of materials and can lead to the discovery of a large number of IR NLO compounds.

         <title>In Situ Self&#8208;Assembly of Antibody&#8208;Rhamnose Complex as a Pre&#8208;Targeting Strategy for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel pre&#8208;targeting strategy that combines host&#8208;guest chemistry with an antibody&#8208;recruiting concept was developed to enhance cancer immunotherapy. After binding to the target site, rituximab&#8208;adamantane conjugates self&#8208;assemble with rhamnose&#8208;modified &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin to form rituximab&#8208;rhamnose complexes. These complexes significantly amplify Fc effector function by recruiting endogenous anti&#8208;rhamnose antibodies.







Abstract
Enhancing the Fc effector functions of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is a proven strategy for improving cancer immunotherapy. In this study, we present a novel pre&#8208;targeting approach that integrates host&#8208;guest chemistry with an antibody&#8208;recruiting concept to create mAbs with superior effector functions. Using rituximab (RTX), a clinically approved anti&#8208;CD20 mAb, as our model, we modified RTX by conjugating it with adamantane (Ada) derivatives and various polyethylene glycol (PEG) linkers to produce RTX&#8208;Ada conjugates. These conjugates effectively formed RTX&#8208;rhamnose (Rha) complexes in&#8197;situ through self&#8208;assembly, driven by host&#8208;guest interactions with Rha&#8208;modified &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin. This mechanism successfully redirected endogenous anti&#8208;Rha antibodies to target cells, enhancing the availability of Fc domains for improved effector functions, including complement&#8208;dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). A structure&#8208;activity relationship study indicated that the potency of these in&#8197;situ complexes was significantly influenced by the length of the PEG linker used; shorter PEG linkers correlated with higher CDC activity. Given the variability in endogenous antibody levels among individuals, this strategy presents a flexible and promising platform for enhancing the efficacy of mAb&#8208;based cancer immunotherapy.

Four shades of pastel: The synthesis, reactivity and in&#8208;depth characterisation of cationic group 15 carbene analogues is reported.







Abstract
The synthesis, characterization and reactivity of the diferrocenylphosphenium ion [Fc2P]+ was extended to the heavier diferrocenylpnictogenium ions, [Fc2E]+ (E=As, Sb, Bi). The lighter diferrocenylnitrenium ion, [Fc2N]+, was detected by mass spectrometry, but could not be isolated. The molecular structures of [Fc2E]+ (E=P, As, Sb, Bi) reveal intramolecular coordination of the iron atoms, which counterbalance the electron deficiency of the pnictogens without affecting the strong Lewis acidities, which were determined according to the method of Gutmann and Beckett. The (electro&#8722;)chemical oxidation and reduction afforded the dications [Fc2E]2+ (E=P (unstable), As) and the neutral dipnictogens Fc2EEFc2 (E=P, As).

         <title>Elevating Nonlinear Optical Response Through D&#8208;Electron Modulation in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a nonlinear optical (NLO) modulation strategy through regulating electronic structure within metal&#8208;organic frameworks, and the minor variations in the coordination transition metal ions played a vital role in regulating of NLO performance. This approach provides a promising platform for investigating the intrinsic mechanisms of NLO activity modulation through both theoretical and experimental perspectives.







Abstract
Electronic structure and excited state behavior is of pronounced influence on regulation of nonlinear optical (NLO) response. Herein, a serials of transition metal ions bearing different d&#8208;electron numbers were in&#8197;situ coordinated within porphyrinic metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), creating NLO&#8208;responsive M&#8208;metal (metal=Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) frameworks. It demonstrated that the NLO properties can be optimized with the increased occupancy of the d&#8208;shell, which enhances the degree of delocalization. Specifically, the full&#8208;filled (d10) electron configuration of Zn2+ stabilizes the electronic structure, combination with &#960;&#8211;&#960;* local excitation character of M&#8722;Zn, promoting charge transfer process and resulting in outstanding NLO properties. Moreover, parameters related to the nonlinear process (&#946;, n2, Im&#967;(3), Re&#967;(3) and &#967;(3)) of M&#8722;Zn are calculated to be higher than those of other materials, consistent with theoretical calculations. This work paves the way for NLO modulation based on electronic analysis and provides a promising approach for constructing high&#8208;performance NLO materials.

The subtle interplay between space filling and interhelix interaction of a new type of soft bent&#8208;core polycatenar molecules induces the spontaneous supramolecular chirality generation and removal upon alkyl chain volume expansion by the reformation of meso&#8208;structure Ia3d with tighter lattice.







Abstract
Bicontinuous cubic liquid crystalline (LC) phases are of particular interest due their possible applications in electronic devices and special supramolecular chirality. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of first examples of achiral bent&#8208;shaped polycatenar dimers, capable of displaying mirror symmetry breaking in their cubic and isotropic liquid phases. The molecules have a taper&#8208;shaped 3,4,5&#8208;trialkoxybenzoate segment connected to rod&#8208;like building unit terminated with one terminal flexible chain. The two segments were connected using an aliphatic spacer with seven methylene units to induce bending of the whole structure. Investigated by the small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS), a double network achiral cubic phase Cub/Ia

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bicontinuous cubic liquid crystalline (LC) phases are of particular interest due their possible applications in electronic devices and special supramolecular chirality. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of first examples of achiral bent-shaped polycatenar dimers, capable of displaying mirror symmetry breaking in their cubic and isotropic liquid phases. The molecules have a taper-shaped 3,4,5-trialkoxybenzoate segment connected to rod-like building unit terminated with one terminal flexible chain. The two segments were connected using an aliphatic spacer with seven methylene units to induce bending of the whole structure. Investigated by the small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), a double network achiral cubic phase Cub/&lt;i&gt;Ia&lt;/i&gt;

 ${\bar{3}}$

&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;, which is a &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-structure, and a chiral triple network cubic phase Cub/&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;23&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;/sup&gt;*&lt;sup&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; are formed. The molecules self-assemble into molecular helices and progress along the networks. Interestingly, different linking groups such as ester or azo linkages and core fluorination lead to distinct local helicity, resulting in an alkyl chain volume dependent phase transition sequence &lt;i&gt;Ia&lt;/i&gt;
3&#8254;

 ${\bar{3}}$

&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;(L) - &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;23* - &lt;i&gt;Ia&lt;/i&gt;
3&#8254;

 ${\bar{3}}$

&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;(S). The re-entry of &lt;i&gt;Ia&lt;/i&gt;
3&#8254;

 ${\bar{3}}$

&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; phase and loss of supramolecular chirality is attributed to the delicate influence of steric effect at the mono-substitute end and interhelix interaction. Besides, aromatic core fluorination was proved to be a successful tool stabilizing the cubic phases in these dimers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Heterometallic [2]Catenane&#8208;Crosslinked Supramolecular Networks with Improved Antibacterial Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterometallic [2]catenane&#8208;crosslinked supramolecular networks are prepared based on the crosslinking of polyethylene glycol (PEG) using a [2]catenane unit. By adjusting the molecular weight of PEG, the solubility of the networks can be tuned and gels are formed. The introduction of [2]catenane offers good antibacterial properties owing to the synergistic antimicrobial activity of Pt(II) and Cu(I) ions in the [2]catenane.







Abstract
The construction of supramolecular networks with novel crosslinks is of great significance in expanding their chemical structures and exploring their advanced functions. Herein, we prepare a type of [2]catenane&#8208;cored supramolecular networks based on the crosslinking of polyethylene glycol (PEG) using a heterometallic [2]catenane unit. By adjusting the molecular weight of PEG, the solubility of the networks can be tuned and gels are formed using low molecular weight PEG. The introduction of heterometallic [2]catenane offers the networks good antibacterial properties owing to the synergistic antimicrobial activity of Pt(II) and Cu(I) ions in the [2]catenane. This study provides a simple and efficient strategy for constructing supramolecular networks with topological crosslinks as antibacterial materials, which will promote the structural design and biological applications of supramolecular networks.

         <title>Widening the Stimuli&#8208;Responsiveness of Aqueous Biphasic Systems by Changing the Ionic Liquid Cation Basicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we demonstrate the formation of novel stimuli&#8208;responsive aqueous biphasic systems (ABS), able to respond simultaneously to temperature and pH, or just to one stimulus. This was achieved with ABS formed by mono or dicationic protic ionic liquids as phase&#8208;forming components, being defined by the ionic liquid cation chemical structure or its basicity, presenting high impact in the design of more sustainable separation processes.







Abstract
Herein we demonstrate the formation of new stimuli&#8208;responsive aqueous biphasic systems (ABS), able to respond simultaneously to temperature and pH, or just to one stimulus, therefore allowing the design of more sustainable separation processes. This dual behavior is achieved with ABS formed by mono&#8208; or dicationic protic ionic liquids as phase&#8208;forming components, being defined by the ionic liquid cation chemical structure or its basicity. While ABS comprising monocationic ionic liquids only respond to the effect of temperature, systems comprising dicationic ionic liquids are simultaneously affected by both temperature and pH variations. Dicationic ionic liquids are here identified as the key to unlock a double response to stimuli, which is due to the presence of two pKa values afforded by the cation. The reported findings contribute to increase the customizability of double stimuli&#8208;responsive ABS based on ionic liquids, whose development was up to date limited to ionic liquids bearing pH&#8208;responsive anions, opening the door towards the development of more sustainable separation processes.

         <title>Regulatory Mechanisms and Synergistic Enhancement of the Diiron YtfE Protein in Nitric Oxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study investigates the YtfE protein in Escherichia coli, essential for mitigating nitrosative stress by converting nitric oxide to nitrous oxide. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis reveals Tunnel 1 as the main substrate pathway regulated by N&#8208;terminal domain shifts, with Tunnel 2 acting as a backup route. Enhancing Tunnel 2 activity triples YtfE's efficiency, offering strategies to boost bacterial stress responses.







Abstract
The diiron&#8208;containing YtfE protein in Escherichia coli is pivotal in counteracting nitrosative stress, a critical barrier to bacterial viability. This study delves into the biochemical complexity governing YtfE's conversion of nitric oxide (NO) to nitrous oxide, a key process for alleviating nitrosative stress. Through site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, we explored YtfE's molecular structure, with a particular focus on two internal transport tunnels important for its activity. Our findings illuminate Tunnel 1 as the primary conduit for substrate transport, regulated by conformational shifts within the N&#8208;terminal domain that enable substrate access to the diiron core in the C&#8208;terminal domain. Tunnel 2 emerges as a secondary, supportive route, activated when Tunnel 1 is compromised. This result challenges a previous model of distinct tunnels for substrate entry and product exit, suggesting both tunnels are capable of transporting substrates and products. Our engineering efforts enhanced the role of Tunnel 2, enabling a synergistic operation with Tunnel 1 and tripling YtfE's enzymatic activity compared to its wild&#8208;type form. This research not only deepens our understanding of YtfE's regulatory mechanism for NO reduction but also introduces a strategy to amplify its enzymatic efficiency. The outcomes offer new ravenues for modulating bacterial stress responses.

         <title>Hollow Superhelices Based on Chiral Europium Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The morphology of Eu(NO3)3/R/S&#8208;pempH2 assemblies can be controlled by pH and concentration of reactants, forming block crystals R/S&#8208;1&#8201;b, hollow superhelices R/S&#8208;2&#8201;hh, rod crystals R/S&#8208;3&#8201;r, and solid superhelices R/S&#8208;4&#8201;sh. Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) studies show that the hollow superhelix of R/S&#8208;2&#8201;hh has a larger dissymmetry factor than the corresponding solid superhelix R/S&#8208;4&#8201;sh.







Abstract
The construction of helical nanotubes based on chiral coordination polymers (CPs) is an intriguing but challenging task, which is important for the development of functional materials that combine macroscopic chirality with tube&#8208;related properties. Here, we selected a chiral europium phosphonate system, e.&#8201;g., Eu(NO3)3/R&#8208;,S&#8208;pempH2, and carried out a systematic work. By controlling the hydrothermal reaction conditions such as the pH value of the reaction mixture, the molar ratio and concentration of the reactants, we obtained block&#8208;like crystals of R/S&#8208;1&#8201;b, rod&#8208;like crystals of R/S&#8208;3&#8201;r, hollow superhelices of R/S&#8208;2&#8201;hh, and solid superhelices of R/S&#8208;4&#8201;sh. In the latter two cases, the chirality has been successfully transferred and amplificated from the molecular level to the macroscopic level. Interestingly, compounds R/S&#8208;2&#8201;hh and R/S&#8208;4&#8201;sh have the same chemical composition of Eu(R/S&#8208;pempH)3&#8901;2H2O and show identical PXRD patterns, thus can be considered as the same material except for different morphologies. We further investigated their circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties and found that the hollow superhelix of R/S&#8208;2&#8201;hh had a larger dissymmetry factor than the solid superhelix of R/S&#8208;4&#8201;sh. This study not only provides the first example of hollow superhelices of chiral CPs, but also offers the possibility of modulating the chiroptical properties of CPs through morphological control.

&lt;b&gt;-1&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;, rod-like crystals of &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;R/S&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-3&#8201;r&lt;/b&gt;, hollow superhelices of &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;R/S&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-2&#8201;hh&lt;/b&gt;, and solid superhelices of &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;R/S&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-4&#8201;sh&lt;/b&gt;. In the latter two cases, the chirality has been successfully transferred and amplificated from the molecular level to the macroscopic level. Interestingly, compounds &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;R/S&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-2&#8201;hh&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;R/S&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-4&#8201;sh&lt;/b&gt; have the same chemical composition of Eu(&lt;i&gt;R/S&lt;/i&gt;-pempH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and show identical PXRD patterns, thus can be considered as the same material except for different morphologies. We further investigated their circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties and found that the hollow superhelix of &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;R/S&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-2&#8201;hh&lt;/b&gt; had a larger dissymmetry factor than the solid superhelix of &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;R/S&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-4&#8201;sh&lt;/b&gt;. This study not only provides the first example of hollow superhelices of chiral CPs, but also offers the possibility of modulating the chiroptical properties of CPs through morphological control.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Experimental and Computational Studies of Steric Factors in the Isomerization of Internal Alkynes within the Coordination Environment of Half&#8208;Sandwich Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal&#8208;supported vinylidene rearrangement of internal alkynes bearing sterically demanding anthracene, durene, and ferrocene substituents was examined. The various steps in the reaction pathway include metal&#8208;fragment activation via chloride abstraction, substrate coordination, and transition&#8208;state analyses were identified and analyzed via DFT level calculations. When coordination of the alkyne is overly restricted by the substrate substituents, the reaction pathway switches to form &#951;6&#8208;coordinated sandwich compounds.







Abstract
The isomerization of internal alkynes Ar1C&#8801;CAr2 within the coordination environment of low&#8208;valent half&#8208;sandwich [Ru(dppe)Cp]+ complexes via a 1,2&#8208;migration process affords vinylidene species [Ru{=C=C(Ar1)Ar2}(dppe)Cp]+. The rearrangement reactions of symmetrically and asymmetrically substituted substrates featuring different electron&#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing groups and of varying steric bulk were modelled using density functional theory (DFT), and the conclusions supported by experimental observations. Examination of the reaction pathway and associated activation barriers reveal a high solvent dependency for the generation of the key intermediate species [Ru(dppe)Cp]+ from [RuCl(dppe)Cp] by halide dissociation in the presence of Na+ salts of weakly coordinating anions, with the lattice enthalpy of the NaCl by&#8208;product playing a critical role in the overall thermochemical balance of the reaction. The activation barriers associated with the reaction of [Ru(dppe)Cp]+ with Ar1C&#8801;CAr2, and the relative energies of the alkyne complexes [Ru(&#951;2&#8208;Ar1C&#8801;CAr2)(dppe)Cp]+, are sensitive to the electron density of the alkyne and conformational changes associated with the &#8216;bend&#8208;back&#8217; of the substrate. The latter differs by up to 66.1&#8197;kJ/mol, which in turn impacts the barrier height of the subsequent 1,2&#8208;migration step involved in the rearrangement process and ultimately the overall thermochemical nature of the complete reaction. The relative importance of these factors is evinced by the successful rearrangement of the very sterically congested 1(9&#8208;anthryl)&#8208;2(9&#8208;phenanthryl) acetylene into the fully characterized diaryl vinylidene complex, which was isolated in 89&#8201;% yield.

         <title>Total Synthesis and Structural Reassignment of the Antitubercular Natural Product Evybactin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We here report the first total synthesis of the antitubercular natural product evybactin, together with the structural reassignment of the previously proposed structure. The optimized synthetic method developed provides access to evybactin on the multi&#8208;hundred&#8208;milligram scale and provides the opportunity for future structure&#8208;activity relationship studies.







Abstract
The escalating threat posed by antibiotic resistance is a global concern and underscores the need for new antibiotics. In this context, the recent discovery of evybactin, a nonribosomal depsipeptide antibiotic that selectively and potently inhibits the growth of M. tuberculosis, is particularly noteworthy. Here, we present the first total synthesis of this natural product, along with a revision of its assigned structure. Our studies revealed a disparity between the structure originally proposed for evybactin and its actual configuration. Specifically, the 3&#8208;methylhistidine residue present in the evybactin core macrocycle was found to be of the d&#8208;configuration rather than the previously assigned l&#8208;His(Me). Having addressed this, we further optimized our solid&#8208;phase synthetic route to provide access to evybactin on a multi&#8208;hundred&#8208;milligram scale. Access to such quantities will allow for more comprehensive studies with this promising antibiotic.

         <title>Synthesis of an Unsymmetrical Dialumane and Kinetic Analysis of its Alkene Insertion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unsymmetrical dialumane was synthesized by the reaction of a nucleophilic alumanyl anion with a bromoalumane and structurally characterized to show the existence of the Et2O&#8208;coordination to the Al atom. Its reactivity toward ethylene and styrene into the Al&#8722;Al bond was examined, and the resulting insertion products underwent subsequent reactions. The reaction of the dialumane with styrene was decelerated by the presence of additional Et2O, suggesting that an Et2O dissociation occurred before the alkene insertion, which can be distinguished from an associative mechanism involving a five&#8208;coordinated Al intermediate.

         <title>Front Cover: Cyclization by Intramolecular Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling&#8211;A Review (Chem. Eur. J. 1/2025)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intramolecular Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross coupling is a powerful tool for the construction of rings of almost all sizes in natural products, natural product analogs, and drug candidates. In the picture, the cyclization reaction is compared to the formation of bubbles that are formed by blowing soapy water through a bubble wand. In analogy, cycles are formed in the intramolecular Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling when the linear precursors pass through an imaginary wand with a Pd catalyst in its ring. More information can be found in the Review by C. Caso and K.&#8208;H. Altmann (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202402664). We thank Andrea Sanapo for help with the preparation of the cover picture.

         <title>Cover Feature: Heavier Diferrocenylpnictogenium Ions (Chem. Eur. J. 1/2025)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular structures of diferrocenylpnictogenium ions show similar intramolecular interactions to those in the lighter [Fc2P]+ congener that contribute to the stabilisation of the positive charge, but do not attenuate the Lewis acidity of the cations. Reduction of the [Fc2P]+ and [Fc2As]+ analogues leads to the formation of the corresponding diphosphine and diarsine, whereas oxidation of these neutral dipnictogens results in element&#8211;element bond cleavage. This (electro)chemical oxidation is represented by a lightning strike, and the formation of the initial phosphenium and arsenium ions. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Mebs, E. Hupf, J. Beckmann and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202403555).

         <title>Cover Feature: Responsive Chirality: Tailoring Supramolecular Assemblies with External Stimuli as Future Platforms for Electronic/Spintronic Materials (Chem. Eur. J. 1/2025)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
External stimuli, such as solvents, chemical additives, temperature, and light, significantly impact chiral self&#8208;assembly, enabling precise control over molecular interactions and chirality. Such dynamic modulation is essential for designing responsive materials, with promising applications in optoelectronics, sensing, and advanced technologies. In the Review by M. Kataria and S. Seki (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202403460) emphasis is placed on the role of these stimuli in modifying supramolecular chirality, suggesting their potential in next&#8208;generation devices.

         <title>From Double&#8208;Stranded Helicates to Abiotic Double Helical Supramolecular Assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Foldamers are synthetic oligomers that can spontaneously adopt compact, ordered, and stable folded conformations, due to the establishment of intramolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions. These secondary structures can also aggregate into complex supramolecular assemblies. These review focuses on the self&#8208;assembly of double helical structures based on intermolecular interactions between both complementary strands.







Abstract
The folding of oligomeric strands is the method that nature has selected to generate ordered assemblies presenting spectacular functions. In the purpose to mimic these biomacromolecules and extend their properties and functions, chemists make important efforts to prepare artificial secondary, tertiary, and even quarternary structures based on folded abiotic backbones. A large variety of oligomers and polymers, encoded with chemical informations, were designed, synthesized and characterized, and the establishment of non&#8208;covalent interactions lead to complex and functional supramolecular architectures resulting from a spontaneous self&#8208;assembly process. The association of complementary molecular strands into double helical structures is a common structural pattern of nucleic acids and proteins, so the synthesis of bio&#8208;inspired double helices has emerged as an important subject. In recent years, a number of synthetic oligomers have been reported to form stable double helices and it was shown that the equilibrium between single and double helices can be controlled via different stimuli like the modification of the solvent or the temperature. This kind of structure presents highly interesting functions, such as molecular recognition within the cavity of double helices, and some other potential applications will emerge in the future.

         <title>Cyclization by Intramolecular Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling&#8211;A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling as the ring&#8208;forming step in the synthesis of natural products/natural product analogs and synthetic bioactive molecules is reviewed. The reaction has been successfully employed for ring construction across a wide range of ring sizes (from 4 to &#8811;12) in a stereoselective fashion.







Abstract
Ring systems of all sizes are frequent core or substructures in natural products and they are important elements of many drug molecules, as they often confer high binding affinity to and selectivity for disease&#8208;relevant biological targets. A uniform key transformation in the synthesis of such structures is the cyclization step. Among the various approaches that have been developed for ring closure, the intramolecular Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction has emerged as a powerful option for the construction of normal&#8208; and medium&#8208;sized rings as well as macrocycles, due to its stereospecificity, the mild reaction conditions, and the non&#8208;toxic nature of the boron by&#8208;products. In this review, we summarize the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of the application of intramolecular Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions in the construction of (macro)cyclic frameworks of natural products and bioactive molecules of synthetic origin, covering (mostly) examples that have been reported since 2015. Target molecules prepared via intramolecular Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling as a key step range from natural products/natural product analogs to synthetic drug candidates, featuring ring sizes from 4 to &#8811;12. We highlight the utility, scope, and limitations of the reaction for different ring sizes and arrays of functional groups. Where possible, comparisons with other methods of cyclization are provided.

&lt;p&gt;Ring systems of all sizes are frequent core or substructures in natural products and they are important elements of many drug molecules, as they often confer high binding affinity to and selectivity for disease-relevant biological targets. A uniform key transformation in the synthesis of such structures is the cyclization step. Among the various approaches that have been developed for ring closure, the intramolecular Suzuki-Miyaura reaction has emerged as a powerful option for the construction of normal- and medium-sized rings as well as macrocycles, due to its stereospecificity, the mild reaction conditions, and the non-toxic nature of the boron by-products. In this review, we summarize the state-of-the-art of the application of intramolecular Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions in the construction of (macro)cyclic frameworks of natural products and bioactive molecules of synthetic origin, covering (mostly) examples that have been reported since 2015. Target molecules prepared &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; intramolecular Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling as a key step range from natural products/natural product analogs to synthetic drug candidates, featuring ring sizes from 4 to &#8811;12. We highlight the utility, scope, and limitations of the reaction for different ring sizes and arrays of functional groups. Where possible, comparisons with other methods of cyclization are provided.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview aims to highlight recent advancement in analytical approaches that can effectively enrich single nucleotide variants for improved clinical diagnostics. Based on when the enrichment step takes place, we categorize all enrichment strategies into pre&#8208;PCR, post&#8208;PCR, and during&#8208;PCR methods.







Abstract
Over the past three decades, significant advancements have been made in mutation enrichment methods, driven by the increasing need for precise and efficient identification of rare genetic variants associated with diseases. Mutation&#8208;enrichment methods have emerged to boost sensitivity and enable easy detection of low&#8208;frequency mutations. These methods are crucial in genomics research and clinical diagnostics, allowing for the detection of low&#8208;frequency mutations within large genomic datasets. This review presents a summary of technological developments in rare mutation enrichment and emphasizes their mechanisms and applications in liquid biopsies.

         <title>Responsive Chirality: Tailoring Supramolecular Assemblies with External Stimuli as Future Platforms for Electronic/Spintronic Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
External stimuli via solvents, additives, temperature, and light profoundly switch chirality in self&#8208;assembly systems, allowing precise control over molecular interactions and assembly pathways. Such modulation offers promising opportunities for designing dynamic responsive materials for use in photonics, electronics, and spintronics. This review highlights how stimuli&#8208;driven chiral modulation could shape future&#8208;generation functional supramolecular materials.







Abstract
Supramolecular chirality is the major branch of supramolecular chemistry, which not only plays important roles in biological processes but also in synthetically designed aggregated systems. To understand the complex processing of biological systems, the only way is to design supramolecular chiral ensembles that mimic natural biomolecules such as Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), Ribonucleic acid (RNA), amino acids, etc. In addition, chiral systems and self&#8208;assemblies as molecular motifs with breaking spatial inversion symmetry have been regarded as key substances in electronics and spintronics as well as in fundamental chemistry and physics. Here, in this review, our major concern is understanding modulation in spatial arrangements and packing modes under the impact of any external stimuli, which results in tailoring the handedness of resulted supramolecular chiral superstructures. We, in this review, highlighted the role of external stimuli such as solvent, chemical additives, photo exposure, etc. in altering the supramolecular chirality for their future utility as &#8220;active switches&#8221; in optoelectronic and spintronic devices and applications.

Solid&#8208;state radical reactions enhance green chemistry metrics and often exhibit unique intermediates and reactivity modes. This minireview explores their role in small molecule synthesis, highlighting their increasing significance in sustainable chemistry.







Abstract
Organic synthesis has historically relied on solution&#8208;phase, polar transformations to forge new bonds. However, this paradigm is evolving, propelled by the rapid evolution of radical chemistry. Additionally, organic synthesis is witnessing a simultaneous resurgence in mechanochemistry, the formation of new bonds in the solid&#8208;state, further contributing to this shift in the status quo. The aforementioned advances in radical chemistry have predominantly occurred in the solution phase, while the majority of mechanochemical synthesis advances feature polar transformations. Herein, we discuss a rapidly advancing area of organic synthesis: mechanochemical radical reactions. Solid&#8208;state radical reactions offer improved green chemistry metrics, better reaction outcomes, and access to intermediates and products that are difficult or impossible to reach in solution. This review explores these reactions in the context of small molecule synthesis, from early findings to the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, underscoring the pivotal role solid&#8208;state radical reactions are likely to play in advancing sustainable chemical synthesis.

Buckybowls possess unique physicochemical and supramolecular assembly features associated with their concave and convex surfaces. The buckybowl&#8208;based molecular receptors show advantages in shape complementarity and electrostatic interaction for hosting fullerenes. Herein, a brief survey for the buckybowl&#8208;based fullerene receptors in the last decade is presented.







Abstract
Buckybowls, bowl&#8208;shaped polyaromatic hydrocarbons, have received intensive interest owing to their multifaceted potentials in supramolecular chemistry and materials science. Buckybowls possess unique chemical and physical properties associated with their concave and convex faces. In view of the shape complementarity, which is one of the key factors for host&#8208;guest assembly, buckybowls are ideal receptors for fullerenes. In fact, the host&#8208;guest assembly between buckybowls and fullerenes is one of the most active topics in buckybowls chemistry, and the resulting supramolecular materials show promising applications in optoelectronics, biomaterials, and so forth. In this tutorial review, we present an overview for the progress on fullerene receptors based on buckybowls over the last decade.

         <title>Enantioselective Cascade Reactions of Aminocatalytic Dienamines and Trienamines Initiated by a Cycloaddition Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review outlines and showcases how aminocatalytic dienamines and trienamines can be used in stereoselective cascade reactions, that are initiated by a cycloaddition reaction to rapidly access complex chiral molecules. We aspire that the chemical community can use this review to design new cascade reaction or use current methodologies in complex molecule synthesis.







Abstract
Cycloadditions are widely accepted as a group of reactions that rapidly generate molecular complexity. Being highly atom economic and often predictable, these reactions can generate up to four stereogenic centers and two C&#8722;C (or C&#8722;X) bonds in one reaction step. During the last two decades, asymmetric aminocatalysis has shown to be a successful strategy for controlling stereoselectivity and enabling reactivity of cycloaddition reactions. By increasing the conjugation of the carbonyl species employed, dienamines and trienamines can be catalytically formed. Not only can these facilitate the cycloaddition, often accompanied by high levels of stereocontrol, but they also leave a residual enamine or carbonyl (by hydrolysis) in the cycloadduct. This residual functionality can engage in further intramolecular reactions generating complex cyclic systems in a one&#8208;pot cascade manner. In this regard, asymmetric aminocatalysis can add another layer of complexity to the already complex nature of cycloadditions. In this review, we will present the general concept of such reactivity patterns of dienamines and trienamines, and hereafter showcase examples in the literature. We aspire that the chemical community can use these concepts to design new enantioselective aminocatalytic cascade reactions to access enantioenriched, complex compounds, and perhaps use these in complex molecule synthesis.

         <title>A Non&#8208;Volatile Pro&#8208;Dicamba Herbicide Inspired by Meclofenoxate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dicamba is a popular herbicide with rising use but is also notorious for volatility drift. Inspired by meclofenoxate, which we show to be highly herbicidal, we developed a derivative of dicamba with an ester&#8208;bond to 2&#8208;dimethylaminoethanol. It remained herbicidal but is non&#8208;volatile, entering plants intact and hydrolyzing inside leaves to dicamba and 2&#8208;dimethylaminoethanol. This pro&#8208;dicamba is compatible with the relatively novel dicamba monooxygenase tolerance technology, suggesting pro&#8208;dicamba might be a suitable, non&#8208;volatile replacement for dicamba.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of MOF&#8208;derived Vanadium Nitride Decorated Micro/mesoporous Carbon Nanofibers for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Design and manufacture of cathode materials, with suitable pore structure and high electrical conductivity to matching zinc anode, solving the problem of dissolution and structural degradation of cathode materials for zinc ion batteries (ZIBs), is great significance to the development of ZIBs. Herein, Vanadium Nitride (VN) uniformly decorated N&#8208;doped micro/mesoporous carbon nanofibers (VN/N&#8208;MCNF) with appropriate porous and reactive sites for Zn2+ is prepared by using V&#8208;MOF, as important precursor via electrostatic spinning and pyrolysis technique. As a cathode electrode for ZIBs, the VN/N&#8208;MCNF is suitable for diffusion and adsorption of large&#8208;sized solvated structured [Zn(H2O)6]2+, for its abundant micro/mesoporous structure and good electrical conductivity. The VN/N&#8208;MCNF electrode has high specific capacity of 242 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 A g&#8208;1 and rate performance. Moreover, the VN/N&#8208;MCNF&#8208;based ZIBs can reach 92.5% capacity retention after 200 cycles at a low current density of 0.3 A g&#8208;1, and can reach 86.1% capacity retention after 5000 cycles at a high current density of 5 A g&#8208;1. These findings highlight the importance of a rational design of cathode materials for high&#8208;performance metal batteries, which can also be extended to the design of other materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Substrate Specificity of Adenine&#8208;Cu&#8208;PO 4 &#160;Nanozyme: Ascorbic Acid Oxidation and Selective Cytotoxicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Though nanozymes are becoming promising alternatives to natural enzymes due to their superior properties, constructing nanozyme with high specificity is still a great challenge. Herein, with Cu2+ as an active site and adenine as a ligand, Adenine&#8208;Cu&#8208;PO4 is synthesized in phosphate&#8208;buffered saline. As an oxidase mimic, Adenine&#8208;Cu&#8208;PO4 could selectively catalyze oxidation of ascorbic acid (AA) to dehydroascorbic acid, but not universal substrates (3,3&#8217;,5,5&#8217;&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), 2,2&#8217;&#8208;azino&#8208;bis (3&#8208;ethylbenzthiazoline&#8208;6&#8208;sulfonic acid) (ABTS) and 2,4&#8208;dichlorophenol (2,4&#8208;DP)), small biomolecules (dopamine, glutathione, glucose, galactose), other vitamins (vitamin A acid, vitamin B1, vitamin K1) and even dithiothreitol (a common interference of AA). Such the specific AA catalytic oxidation is revealed that Adenine&#8208;Cu&#8208;PO4 selectively binds with AA through hydrogen bonds, accompanied with catalyzing AA oxidation, and concurrently O2 transferring to H2O2 via O2&#8226;&#8208;, further to H2O via &#8226;OH. Based on the produced reactive oxygen species, with AA as a pro&#8208;oxidant, Adenine&#8208;Cu&#8208;PO4 nanozyme efficiently triggers severe intratumor oxidative stress to induce tumor cell death. This work opens a new avenue to design intrinsic nanozymes with high specificity, and also presents a promising application in the field of AA oxidation induced cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of UCST&#8208;Responsive Claw&#8208;Like Polysulfobetaines for Efficient Capture of Cellulase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high cost of enzymatic glycolysis has seriously restricted the industrialization of lignocellulose&#8208;based sugar platform technology. Recovering and recycling cellulase can reduce the cost. Here, a thermo&#8208;responsive claw&#8208;type polysulfobetaine (PSPA) was constructed for hydrophobic grasping and efficient recycling of cellulase. Compared with the linear sulfobetaine homopolymer (PSPE), PSPA had more sensitive temperature response and strong cellulase recovery ability. PSPE&#8208;3 (Mw=355.1 kDa) was added to the hydrolysis system of corncob residue (CCR) (50 &#176;C), at 0.4 mass ratio of PSPE&#8208;3 to cellulase, and after enzymatic hydrolysis, 50% of the cellulase was saved when cooling to 25 &#176;C. But only 0.05 times PSPA&#8208;1 (Mw=30.0 kDa) was added to the CCR system, and 70% of the cellulase was saved when cooling to 25 &#176;C. This work presents a claw shaped protein&#8208;capture agent, polysulfobetaine for capturing cellulase, which is of great significance to reduce the lignocellulosic hydrolysis cost, and efficiently separate enzyme proteins.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The high cost of enzymatic glycolysis has seriously restricted the industrialization of lignocellulose-based sugar platform technology. Recovering and recycling cellulase can reduce the cost. Here, a thermo-responsive claw-type polysulfobetaine (PSPA) was constructed for hydrophobic grasping and efficient recycling of cellulase. Compared with the linear sulfobetaine homopolymer (PSPE), PSPA had more sensitive temperature response and strong cellulase recovery ability. PSPE-3 (Mw=355.1 kDa) was added to the hydrolysis system of corncob residue (CCR) (50 &#176;C), at 0.4 mass ratio of PSPE-3 to cellulase, and after enzymatic hydrolysis, 50% of the cellulase was saved when cooling to 25 &#176;C. But only 0.05 times PSPA-1 (Mw=30.0 kDa) was added to the CCR system, and 70% of the cellulase was saved when cooling to 25 &#176;C. This work presents a claw shaped protein-capture agent, polysulfobetaine for capturing cellulase, which is of great significance to reduce the lignocellulosic hydrolysis cost, and efficiently separate enzyme proteins.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;organic Framework with Polar Pore Surface Designed for Purification of Both Natural Gas and Ethylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The advancement of high&#8208;value CH4 purification technology within the natural gas industry is paramount for industrial processes. Herein, we constructed ZJNU&#8208;402, a new porous material characterized by permanent porosity, as an effective adsorbent for separating C3H8/CH4 and C2H6/CH4 mixtures. The findings reveal an outstanding C3H8 adsorption capacity of 68 cm3 g&#8211;1 and a moderate C2H6 adsorption rate of 42 cm3 g&#8211;1, with a notably lower CH4 adsorption rate of 11 cm3 g&#8211;1. Noteworthy is the exceptional selectivity of ZJNU&#8208;402 for C3H8/CH4 and C2H6/CH4, standing at 375 and 31, respectively, surpassing many previously documented high&#8208;performance adsorbents and breaking the traditional trade&#8208;off between adsorption capacity and separation selectivity. Adsorption heat calculations show that compared with CH4 molecules, C3H8 and C2H6 molecules form stronger bonds with the skeleton, resulting in excellent separation performance. In addition, the breakthrough experiment of ZJNU&#8208;402 can also completely separate the ternary component C3H8/C2H6/CH4 mixture to obtain 99.95% high&#8208;purity methane. At the same time, ZJNU&#8208;402 also has excellent structural stability, excellent recyclability, and low isosteric adsorption heat. Consequently, ZJNU&#8208;402 exhibits substantial potential for augmenting the efficacy of natural gas enrichment processes.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA Origami Adsorption and Lattice Formation on Different SiOx Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembled DNA origami lattices on silicon oxide surfaces have great potential to serve as masks in molecular lithography. However, silicon oxide surfaces come in many different forms and the type and history of the silicon oxide has a large effect on its physicochemical surface properties. Therefore, we here investigate DNA origami lattice formation on differently fabricated SiOx films on silicon wafers after wet&#8208;chemical oxidation by RCA1. Despite having similar oxide compositions and hydroxylation states, of all surfaces tested, only thermally grown SiOx performs similarly well as native oxide. For the other SiOx films deposited by plasma&#8208;enhanced chemical vapor deposition and magnetron sputtering, DNA origami adsorption is strongly suppressed. This is attributed to an increased surface roughness and a lower oxide density, respectively. Our results demonstrate that the employed SiOx surface may decide over the outcome of an experiment and should be considered as an additional parameter that may require optimization and fine&#8208;tuning before high&#8208;quality lattices can be assembled. In particular, our observations suggest that efficient DNA origami lattice assembly on SiOx surfaces requires a low surface roughness and a high oxide density.</dc:description>

         <title>AIE&#8208;active Circularly Polarized Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters for Stable Solution&#8208;Processed Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence</title>

         <dc:description>Circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) have significant promise for naked&#8208;eye 3D displays. However, most devices are fabricated using vacuum deposition technology, and development of efficient solution&#8208;processed CP&#8208;OLEDs, particularly those exhibiting low efficiency roll&#8208;off, remains a formidable challenge. This research successfully designed and synthesized two pairs of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) enantiomers through isomer engineering, namely (R/S)&#8208;N&#8208;5&#8208;TPA and (R/S)&#8208;N&#8208;4&#8208;TPA, which features fifth and fourth substitution sites of phthalimide (acceptor) by tri&#8208;phenylamine (donor), respectively. Both molecules displayed aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties. Notably, the CP&#8208;OLED devices, fabricated by solution&#8208;process, exhibited vivid blue&#8208;green and green emission with the maximum current efficiency of 7.4 and 29.6 cd A&#8208;1, the external quantum efficiency of 2.7% and 10.2%, and the low efficiency roll&#8208;off of 3.7% and 16.7%. Moreover, these devices demonstrated CP&#8208;EL signals with gEL values of +6.61 &#215; 10&#8208;4 /&#8208;6.84 &#215; 10&#8208;4 and +1.13 &#215; 10&#8208;3/&#8208;1.25 &#215; 10&#8208;3, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Scaffolded Detergents for Membrane Protein Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Detergents are essential for preserving the structural integrity and functionality of membrane proteins (MPs) outside the biological membrane or in aqueous solution, and thus ensuring accurate biochemical and structural analyses. Here, we introduce peptide&#8208;scaffolded detergents, a novel class of hybrid molecules formed by preassembling detergent monomers with peptides of varying lengths, mediated via Click chemistry. These detergents are characterized by scalable, straightforward synthesis and enhanced solubility. Among the variants, A4B2 emerged as the optimal detergent, demonstrating superior thermal stabilization across a range of G protein&#8208;coupled receptors, including A2AAR, SMO and GLP&#8208;1R. Additionally, A4B2 exhibits a low critical micelle concentration and small micelle size, together making it particularly effective for electron microscopy studies of A2AAR. This innovative design leverages the benefits of peptide&#8208;based and traditional detergents, offering new insights for the development of advanced detergents in MP research.</dc:description>

         <title>Property Tuning in N&#8208;Methylpyrrole Azo&#8208;Photoswitches via Modification of the Peripheral Substituents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of pyrrole&#8208;azo&#8211;benzene molecular photoswitches was designed and prepared to comprehensively address the substitution effect on the photoswitching performance. By selecting proper substituents, the switching ranging from seconds to hours can be achieved along with a large tuning of thermal, (non)linear optical, and electrochemical properties.







Abstract
Differently substituted pyrrole&#8208;azo&#8211;benzene molecular photoswitches were prepared in a straightforward synthetic way. Their fundamental properties were investigated by XRD analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, cyclic voltammetry, UV&#8211;Vis absorption spectroscopy, Hyper&#8208;Rayleigh Scattering, and NMR spectroscopy; the experimental results were further corroborated by DFT calculations. Thermal robustness, the HOMO/LUMO levels, and the absorption properties were altered mostly by substituting the N&#8211;methylpyrrole moiety and further fine&#8208;tuned by modifying the benzene substituents. The pyrrole substituent also proved crucial for the second&#8208;order non&#8211;linear optical (NLO) response as well as the photoswitching performance. Both fast and slow molecular switches can be designed with the half&#8211;life of the (Z) &#8211;isomer ranging from 48&#8197;seconds to 23.28&#8197;hours and the E/Z molar ratio up to 12/88. This comprehensive study allowed elucidation of the fundamental structure&#8208;property relationships and subsequently addresses the key aspects of the property tuning via substitution in molecular azo&#8208;photoswitches.

         <dc:description>
The creation of multicomponent materials with desired properties and functions is a challenge of modern materials chemistry. Chiral nematic mesoporous organosilicas have iridescent properties that make them attractive for decoration and sensing. In this paper, we demonstrate the chemical functionalization of chiral nematic mesoporous organosilica films with cyclodextrin &#8211; a new class of hybrid inclusion materials.







Abstract
The creation of multicomponent materials with desired properties and functions is a challenge of modern materials chemistry. Chiral nematic mesoporous organosilicas have iridescent properties that make them attractive for decoration and sensing. In this paper, we demonstrate the chemical functionalization of chiral nematic mesoporous organosilica films with cyclodextrin. In this way, we have been able to create chiral nematic mesoporous films with macrocyclic molecules on the surface to obtain a new class of hybrid inclusion materials.

         <title>C(sp2)&#8722;H Acylation of Benzo[h]quinolines at Room Temperature via Aldehyde Autoxidation and Palladium Catalysis Cooperation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aerobic radical C(sp2)&#8722;H acylation is developed, utilizing the simultaneous cooperation of aldehyde autoxidation with Pd&#8208;catalysis. A key aspect of the process is the selective amalgamation of acyl radical generated by aldehyde autoxidation with Pd&#8208;catalysis via substrate&#8208;guided radical sorting. The desired acylated products are obtained in generally good yields (up to 82&#8201;%). Based on the results obtained in a series of control studies and DFT calculations, a proposed PdII/PdIII&#8208;catalytic cycle has been implicated.







Abstract
Herein, we report Pd&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H acylation using aldehyde as acyl source and O2 as the green oxidant at room temperature. A selective association of acyl radical formed in&#8208;situ during aldehyde autoxidation with Pd&#8208;catalysis is the key to the process. The reaction afforded products in good yields (up to 82&#8201;%) and it is scalable. The proposed PdII/PdIII&#8208;catalytic cycle is supported by a series of control studies and DFT calculations.

         <title>Achieving Precise Control Over the Molecular Periphery of Dibenzoixenes Through Modular Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report rationally designed modular syntheses of isomeric dibenzoixenes with diverse molecular peripheries, including cove, zigzag, bay, fjord, and gulf structures. The edge structures of these molecules were not only thoroughly analyzed by spectroscopic techniques, but also evaluated by their applications in Li&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Nanographenes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, both finite forms of graphene, are promising organic semiconducting materials because their optoelectronic and magnetic properties can be modulated through precise control of their molecular peripheries. Several atomically precise edge structures have been prepared by bottom&#8208;up synthesis; however, no systematic elucidation of these edge topologies at the molecular level has been reported. Herein, we describe rationally designed modular syntheses of isomeric dibenzoixenes with diverse molecular peripheries, including cove, zigzag, bay, fjord, and gulf structured. The single&#8208;crystal structures of dibenzo[a,p]ixene and dibenzo[j,y]ixene reveal enantiomeric pairs with helically twisted cove edges and packing structures. The molecular edge structures are identified from the C&#8722;H bonds of the dibenzoixenes using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy with different vibrational modes, which were further explained using density functional theory calculations. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy indicates that the zigzag&#8208;edged molecular periphery significantly affects the magnetic properties of the material. Furthermore, the electrochemical characteristics, examined using dibenzoixenes as anode materials in Li&#8208;ion batteries, reveal that the dibenzo[a,p]ixene exhibits promising Li intercalation behaviors with a specific capacity of ~120&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. The findings of this study could facilitate the synthesis of larger

         <title>Electrocatalytic HER Performance of [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenase Mimics Bearing M&#8208;salen Moieties (M=Zn, Ni, Fe, Mn)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of novel complexes (5&#8208;8) combining [(&#956;&#8208;adt)Fe2(CO)6] fragments and M&#8208;salen (M=Zn, Ni, Fe, Mn) complexes has been achieved. Computational studies confirm distinct geometries for the Zn, Ni, Fe, and Mn complexes. Electrochemical and electrocatalytic experiments reveal cooperative proton reduction and notable reductions in overpotential, especially for the Ni, Fe, and Mn complexes, highlighting their catalytic potential.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of novel compounds (5&#8208;8) as mimetics of [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase, combining two distinct systems capable of participating in hydrogen evolution reactions (HER): the [(&#956;&#8208;adt)Fe2(CO)6] fragment and M&#8208;salen complexes (salen=N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(salicylidene)ethylenediamine) (M=Zn, Ni, Fe, Mn), is reported. These complexes were synthesized in high yields via a three&#8208;step procedure from N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(4&#8208;R&#8208;salicylidene)ethanediamine) 4 [R=Fe2(CO)6(&#956;&#8208;SCH2)2NCOCH2O]. Structural analysis through spectroscopic, spectrometric, and computational (DFT) methods confirmed distorted tetrahedral and square&#8208;planar geometries for Zn&#8208;salen and Ni&#8208;salen complexes (5 and 6) respectively, while complexes Fe&#8208;salen 7 and Mn&#8208;salen 8 exhibit square&#8208;based pyramidal structures typical of Fe(III) and Mn(III) high&#8208;spin salen&#8208;complexes. Electrochemical studies revealed different reduction events for [(&#956;&#8208;adt)Fe2(CO)6] and M&#8208;salen moieties, but the electrocatalytic experiments in TFA demonstrated a clear cooperative effect between these components, especially at higher acid concentrations. Notably, the Ni&#8208;salen (6), Fe&#8208;salen (7), and Mn&#8208;salen (8) complexes exhibit significant reductions in overpotential, highlighting their potential for enhanced catalytic performance.

         <title>Reductive Zincke Reaction: Opening of Pyridinium Rings to &#948;&#8208;Amino Ketones via Transfer Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new pyridine ring&#8208;opening reaction, reductive Zincke reaction, is described, which allows various pyridinium compounds to be ring&#8208;opened to afford saturated &#948;&#8208;amino ketones, with a simple rhodium catalyst under mild transfer hydrogenation conditions. The versatility of the reaction is further demonstrated in the synthesis of drug analogues and late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceutical compounds.







Abstract
The Zincke reaction and Birch reduction have been one of the few reactions that allow for ring opening of pyridines ever since the discovery of pyridine more than a century ago. This paper presents a new addition to the list of pyridine ring&#8208;opening reactions, reductive Zincke reaction, which affords saturated &#948;&#8208;amino ketones. Under the catalysis of a simple rhodium complex, pyridinium salts with diverse substituents are reduced with formic acid, ring&#8208;opened with water, transaminated with a secondary amine and further reduced to afford a wide range of &#948;&#8208;amino ketones, including those in which the alkane chain of the ketones is selectively deuterated or fluorinated. The applicability of the reaction is exemplified by the synthesis of drug analogues and late&#8208;stage modification of drug molecules.

         <title>Tuning the Duplex Stability of DNA Oligonucleotides Containing Metal&#8208;Mediated Base Pairs of Imidazole&#8208;Derived Nucleobases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of metal&#8208;mediated base pairs comprised of HQIm (3H&#8208;imidazo[4,5&#8208;f]quinolin&#8208;5&#8208;ol) and/or CaIm (imidazole&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylate) induces a significant thermal stabilization of DNA with the 3d metal ions CoII, NiII and ZnII, as well as the lanthanoid ions EuIII and SmIII. The thermal stability is dependent on the identity of the artificial base pair and added metal ion, as well as the pH value.







Abstract
Two artificial imidazole&#8208;derived nucleobases, HQIm (3H&#8208;imidazo[4,5&#8208;f]quinolin&#8208;5&#8208;ol) and CaIm (imidazole&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylate), were introduced into short DNA duplexes to systematically investigate their thermal stability upon metal ion coordination. Metal&#8208;mediated base pairs are formed with the 3d metal ions CoII, NiII and ZnII, as well as with the lanthanoid ions EuIII and SmIII, which induce a thermal stabilization of up to 8&#8201;&#176;C upon binding. The latter are the first lanthanoid&#8208;mediated base pairs involving only four donor atoms that result in a significant duplex stabilization. For the 3d metal ions, the increase in DNA melting temperature is in agreement with the trend in complex stability according to the Irving&#8208;Williams series. The duplex stabilization upon metal&#8208;mediated base pair formation depends on the identity of the artificial base pair, enabling discrimination between metal ions by systematic design of the duplex. Further, the influence of pH on the stability of selected duplexes was studied, revealing a linear relation between pH and the formation of HQIm&#8211;NiII&#8211;HQIm base pairs and allowing to induce a distinct stabilization between 1&#8201;&#176;C and 28&#8201;&#176;C. Regarding EuIII&#8208;mediated base pairs, an acidic pH can be utilized to disturb their formation, presumably by promoting the coordination of EuIII to the DNA backbone.

         <title>Interfacial Synergism in NiMoO4/FeOOH Heterostructure for Enhanced Alkaline Oxygen Evolution and Urea Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;dimensional core&#8208;shell NiMoO4/FeOOH heterojunction with high OER activity and stability was developed. In which, a thin FeOOH layer would provide greater electrochemical activity with less charge transfer resistance, and the entire FeOOH layer is close to the interface with NiMoO4 would provide electron an electron highway for electron transfer to further improve the electric conductivity of FeOOH.







Abstract
FeOOH with excellent catalytic properties for oxygen evolution and also considered to be a true active site has attracted great interest in recent years. However, the intrinsic low conductivity limits its catalytic performance. Herein, a one&#8208;dimensional core&#8208;shell NiMoO4/FeOOH heterojunction with high OER activity and stability was developed. At current densities of 10 and 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, low overpotentials of 194 and 266&#8197;mV are need to drive oxygen evolution, meanwhile, the electrode exhibits high catalytic kinetics with small Tafel slopes of 53.4&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 and excellent stability over 100&#8197;hours. Further analysis showed that the ultrathin FeOOH layer (~5&#8197;nm) uniformly covered the surface of NiMoO4 nanorods, acting as an active species and facilitating the surface change transfer to the interior. The internal NiMoO4 cores, on the other hand, provides reliable electron transmission as a highly conductive medium, and can effectively overcome the low conductivity of FeOOH. DFT calculations further manifest the strong electronic interactions between NiMoO4 and FeOOH species. The NiMoO4 core serves as mass transport of active materials is beneficial to tune the adsorption energy of OH&#8722; on the surface of electrocatalysts.

         <title>Data Analysis Methods in Time&#8208;Resolved Fluorescence Spectroscopy: A Tutorial Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modern approach to analyse complex fluorescence decays should include more than fitting to a multi&#8208;exponential decay. This review provides an accessible and comprehensive overview of the techniques available to analyse luminescence decays. Each method is explained thoroughly, highlighting its strengths and limitations. A practical example is provided on which a workflow combining several methods is applied.







Abstract
Fluorescence spectroscopy and related techniques benefit from exceptional sensitivity and have become engrained in a variety of fields from biosciences to materials sciences. Measuring time&#8208;domain fluorescence decays is nowadays a routine task in many laboratories across these different fields. Perhaps surprisingly, a correct data analysis of these fluorescence decay curves presents a formidable challenge and requires extensive insight in the problems associated with fitting this type of data. As a result, the reported analysis of these decays is usually limited to a non&#8208;linear least squares fit of a sum of a few exponential terms to the data. This review aims to expose the intricate field of data analysis in time&#8208;resolved fluorescence spectroscopy to a broader audience, from researchers interested in understanding the photophysics of their system to readers and reviewers trying to understand the merits of specific methods. Challenges associated with this type of kinetic experimental data are outlined and the clever analysis strategies devised by researchers across different disciplines are introduced and discussed in detail. A section on freely available scripts and software facilitating the analysis is included towards the end. We encourage the reader to try their hand at the worked examples.

         <title>Photocatalytic Multiple Deuteration of Polyethylene Glycol Derivatives Using Deuterium Oxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supporting information for this article is given via a link at the end of the document.We successfully established a multiple deuteration for PEG derivatives via photocatalytic &#945;&#8208;oxy C(sp3)&#8722;H activation in the presence of TBADT using D2O as an inexpensive deuterium source. The mechanistic study using DFT calculation etc. revealed deuteration reactivity. This first accomplishment of multiple deuterium incorporation to PEG skeleton will contribute to develop the future deuterium science and medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
Deuterated molecules are of growing interest because of the specific characteristics of deuterium, such as stronger C&#8722;D bonds being stronger than C&#8722;H bonds. Polyethylene glycols (PEGs) are widely utilized in scientific fields (e.&#8201;g., drug discovery and material sciences) as linkers and for the improvement of various properties (solubility in water, stability, etc.) of mother compounds. Therefore, deuterated PEGs can be used as novel tools for drug discovery. Although the H/D exchange reaction (deuteration) is a powerful and straightforward method to produce deuterated compounds, the deuteration of PEGs bearing many unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds has not been developed. Herein, we report the photocatalytic deuteration of multiple sites of PEGs using tetra&#8208;n&#8208;butylammonium decatungstate (TBADT) and D2O as an inexpensive deuterium source. This deuteration can be adapted to PEG derivatives bearing various substituents ((hetero)aryl, benzoyl, alkyl, etc.). The deuteration efficiencies of the &#945;&#8208;oxy C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds at the terminal positions of the PEGs were strongly influenced by the substituents. These reactivities were elucidated by density functional theory calculations of the reaction barriers towards the formation of radical intermediates, induced by the excited state of TBADT and the PEG substrate. In addition, the applicability of deuterated PEGs to internal standard experiments and Raman spectroscopy was demonstrated.

         <title>Defluorinative Diazolation&#8208;Cyclization Relay for Synthesis of Furan&#8208;Bridged Triheterocycles and Colorimetric Sensor Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategic connection of two azacycles via a furan bridge through a defluorinative diazolation&#8208;cyclization reaction of trifluoromethyl enones and N&#8208;heterocycles was developed. A range of modular 2,4&#8208;furan&#8208;bridged triheterocycles (FBTHs), featuring a C3&#8208;trifluoromethyl group, was synthesized in moderate to good yields with broad substrate scope and good regioselectivity under transition metal&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
Polyaromatics, as the assembly of diverse cyclic &#960;&#8208;systems, exhibit unique physicochemical properties when compared to their individual constituents. In this study, we developed a strategic connection of two azacycles via a furan bridge through a defluorinative diazolation&#8208;cyclization reaction of trifluoromethyl enones and N&#8208;heterocycles. A range of modular 2,4&#8208;furan&#8208;bridged triheterocycles (FBTHs), featuring a C3&#8208;trifluoromethyl group, was synthesized with broad substrate scope and good regioselectivity under transition metal&#8208;free conditions. This three&#8208;component protocol was achieved through successive C(sp3)&#8208;F bond functionalization of one trifluoromethyl group, which is recognized for its stability and durability. Moreover, the synthetically useful functionalities such as bromide and formyl group could be easily installed on the resulting products, and the imidazole&#8208;containing FBTH could serve as a valuable ligand in the preparation of an advanced colorimetric sensor, thereby underscoring their potential applications.

         <title>Block Architectures in 2D Polymer Networks Fabricated via Sequential Copolymerization in a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) polymer network monolayers with novel block architectures were synthesized using a metal&#8208;organic framework template. Sequential RAFT copolymerization of methyl methacrylate and styrene produced &#8216;patchy&#8217; domains, with AFM revealing nanoscopic phase segregation in the individual 2D nanosheets. This approach offers a novel route to flexible, anisotropic 2D polymeric nanomaterials.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) polymer network monolayers with novel block architectures were fabricated via sequential copolymerization within a pillared&#8208;layer metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) that served as the reaction template. The MOF provides a confined 2D nanospace, restricting the crosslinking copolymerization of vinyl monomers to two dimensions. Sequential crosslinking copolymerization of methyl methacrylate and styrene, regulated by the reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) process, resulted in the formation of 2D block architectures with &#8216;patchy&#8217; domains consisting of crosslinked poly(methyl methacrylate) and polystyrene segments. Atomic force microscopy revealed that the resulting block monolayers exhibited varied morphologies on substrates, attributed to their intrinsic flexibility in 2D conformation, which facilitated microphase separation of the 2D segments within monolayers, leading to the unique aggregation morphologies. The unprecedented block topology in 2D polymeric monolayers presented in this study introduces a novel strategy for designing 2D polymeric nanomaterials with flexible yet anisotropic properties.

         <title>Photoexcited Hantzsch Ester Anions Enabled C&#8722;F Bond Activation and Hydro&#8208;Difluoroalkylation of Arylethylenes Through Dual&#8208;SET Process</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hantzsch ester (HE) is a classic reductant used for single electron transfer (SET) and/or hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). However, there have been only a few examples involving the highly reducing properties of the photoexcited HE anion. One guiding idea, the installation of electron donor groups (EDGs) on the HE moiety to prepare super&#8208;reductants, has not yet been explored. In this study, we report the C&#8722;F bond activation and hydro&#8208;difluoroalkylation of arylethylenes via a dual&#8208;SET process enabled by Hantzsch ester anions under blue light irradiation. This method demonstrates excellent compatibility with both electron&#8208;deficient and electron&#8208;rich aryl&#8208;CF3, enabling synthesis of a broad range of gem&#8208;difluoroalkanes, including the bioisostere. Mechanistic studies indicate that, in addition to the established SET process of Hantzsch ester anions, a key secondary SET process from the Hantzsch ester radical generated in the first SET also occurs.







Abstract
In this study, we reported a new approach to activate the C&#8722;F bond of trifluoromethylarenes to achieve the hydro&#8208;difluoroalkylation of arylethylenes using photoexcited Hantzsch esters (HEs) anions. A wide range of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroalkanes was synthesized. Late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug molecules and synthesis of bioactive molecule bioisostere were also presented. Mechanistic studies revealed that the dual&#8208;single electron transfer (SET) process of HEs anion was the key to this reaction.

         <title>Inter&#8208; and Intra&#8208;Molecular Charge Redistributions in H&#8208;Bonded Cyanuric Acid*Melamine (CA*M) Networks: Insight From Core Level Spectroscopy and Natural Bond Orbital Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The heteromolecular H&#8208;bonding interaction between Cyanuric Acid (CA) and Melamine (M) involves two types of H&#8208;bonds, where the two molecules alternatively act as H&#8208;donors and H&#8208;acceptors. However, the strengths of these interaction are unequal resulting in a net charge transfer from M to CA. Additionally, the intermolecular charge transfer is accompanied by enhanced electron delocalization within both molecules.







Abstract
In this work, we elucidate the electronic charge redistributions that occur within the cyanuric acid (CA) and melamine (M) molecules upon formation of the triple H&#8208;bond between the imide group of CA and the diaminopyridine group of M. To achieve this, we investigated 2D H&#8208;bonded assemblies of M, CA and CA*M grown on the Au(111) surface, using X&#8208;ray photoemission (XPS) and near edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopies. Compared to the homomolecular networks, the spectra of the mixed sample reveal core level shifts in opposite directions for CA and M, indicating a nearly complementary charge accumulation on the CA molecule and a charge depletion on the M molecule. These findings were further confirmed by theoretical simulation of the ionization potentials (IPs), which were computed using unsupported models of the H&#8208;bonded networks. A natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis performed on the three systems helped to rationalize the net charge transfer form M to CA. Finally, we observed that intramolecular interactions (electron delocalization effects) contribute progressively to the charge redistributions inside the two molecules when going from the homomolecular to the heteromolecular networks.

         <title>Exploring Benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b]benzothiophene S&#8208;Oxides for Organic Electronics, Fluorescence&#8208;Based Applications, and Asymmetric Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The paper investigates the effect of sulfur atom oxidation on the structural, thermal, optical, and electronic properties of benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b]benzothiophene (BTBT). It also explores the potential applications of the synthesized BTBT S&#8208;oxides in various fields, including asymmetric synthesis, fluorescent imaging, and organic electronics, highlighting their significance in advancing these areas.







Abstract
A series of benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b]benzothiophene S&#8208;oxides has been efficiently synthesized via one&#8208; or two&#8208;step selective oxidation of benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b]benzothiophene (BTBT). These BTBT S&#8208;oxides form highly ordered structures that display optical anisotropy, are thermally stable up to temperatures above 210&#8201;&#176;C, and do not show phase transitions. They exhibit long excited state lifetimes (0.181&#8211;0.869&#8197;ms) and are more resistant to oxidative degradation than their parent unoxidized BTBT. Some of these compounds demonstrate high quantum yields, exceeding 98&#8201;% in solution and 71&#8201;% in the solid state. As evidenced by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, BTBT&#8208;based sulfoxides have sufficiently high pyramidal inversion energy barriers that prevent their stereomutation at room temperature. Additionally, fully S&#8208;oxidized BTBT meets the energy&#8208;splitting criterion required for the singlet fission process, with the T1 energy level that makes it suitable for device application.

         <title>Kinetic Modelling and Machine Learning Approaches on the Conductance Transients of Zn0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 Sensors for Addressing Cross&#8208;sensitivity towards Ethanol and Acetone Vapors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic approach addresses ethanol and acetone vapor discrimination using wet chemically prepared Zn0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 nanoparticles. The study explores synthesis, characterization, and sensing performance under varying conditions. Kinetic modelling and machine learning algorithms provide insights, enhancing selectivity precision and response prediction. This robust strategy advances volatile organic compound detection with improved discrimination of sensing signals.







Abstract
The accurate discrimination among various volatile organic compounds, especially ethanol and acetone possess a serious concern for metal oxide based chemiresistive sensors. The work presents a systematic approach to address the issue by utilizing superior sensing potentiality of Zn0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 coupled with efficient machine learning (ML) techniques. The work provides a thorough understanding on the synthesis, characterization of Zn0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 nanoparticles and evaluates their sensing performance towards ethanol and acetone vapors. The optimized sensor performance recorded under varying concentrations (100&#8211;1000&#8197;ppm) of analytes across the range of temperature (225&#8211;300&#8201;&#176;C) provides lesser selectivity between acetone and ethanol. The Langmuir&#8208;Hinshelwood reaction mechanism was invoked further to address the selectivity issue by modelling the response transients of the sensor to get an insight into sensing interaction at a microscopic level. The estimated activation energy values of ethanol (0.26&#8197;eV) have been found to be smaller compared to that of acetone (0.34&#8197;eV), explaining little higher response of the sensor towards ethanol. Moreover, some efficient ML algorithms were employed to predictively analyze the acquired sensing data for achieving more precise discriminations between these two analytes.

         <title>Microwave&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of Platinum&#8208;free High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Catalysts on Reduced Graphene Oxide Sheets for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction and Evolution Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Innovations in catalysis are crucial, particularly through a straightforward and facile method. Nano&#8208;sized Pt&#8208;free high entropy alloys were synthesized via a pulsed microwave technique at low temperature, which serve as efficient electrochemical catalysts for the ORR and OER. The synthesized catalysts are promising candidate for the green energy technology.







Abstract
Nano&#8208;sized high&#8208;entropy materials (HEMs) recently received more attention to researchers due to their superior electrochemical catalytic properties. HEMs comprise at least five elements with or without metals and are synthesized through solid&#8208;state reactions and solution&#8208;mediated techniques. The presence of many elements in these HEMs result in a high mixing entropy and facilitates the formation of stable solid solutions in fundamental crystal structures. Herein, Pt&#8208;free high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) were synthesized through facile and straightforward pulse microwave (PM) synthesis technique, which serve as efficient electrochemical catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The PM synthesis method was conducted at an extremely low temperature (100&#8201;&#176;C) without any external catalytic reagents. Using this PM technique, Cr18.2Zr13.5Ti5.3Co17.8Ni8.4Cu8.5Fe28.3 and Al15.3Mn18.2Ti3.7Co23.2Ni5.9Cu5.9Fe27.8 HEAs catalysts were synthesized with superior catalytic activity towards OER and ORR and compare its activities with pure Pt catalysts. The as&#8208;prepared HEAs also display an anti&#8208;CO poisoning effect and long&#8208;term durability, as compared to pure Pt catalysts. The low&#8208;temperature PM approach not only confirms the feasibility of synthesis of noble metal&#8208;free HEAs but also validates their superior catalytic activity towards OER and ORR, which is beneficial for the development of proton exchange membrane fuel cells and proton exchange membrane water electrolysis.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Multicentric DIL@PDIL Catalyst for Mild CO2 Conversion to Cyclic Carbonates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicentric DIL@PDIL catalyst was efficiently synthesized from five readily available starting materials in one&#8208;pot. The multicentric catalyst possessed high ion density and demonstrated satisfactory catalytic performance under mild conditions. The [TMGH]+, Br&#8722;, &#8208;COO&#8722;, and imidazole cation of the gemini DIL were found to synergistically facilitate the CO2 cycloaddition reaction.







Abstract
Among the various studies on CO2 utilization, the sustainable and cost&#8208;effective fixation of CO2 into cyclic carbonates remains one of the most intriguing subjects. To this end, a novel type of composite dicationic ionic liquid material, DIL@PDIL, was developed. This composite consists of a dicationic ionic liquid (DIL), DMAP[TMGH]Br, supported on a polymeric dicationic ionic liquid (PDIL), P&#8208;DVB/Im[TMGH]Br. The multicentric high&#8208;ion&#8208;density material was prepared with exceptional efficiency from five readily available starting materials in one pot through simultaneous quaternization, neutralization and polymerization. The structure was characterized using FT&#8208;IR, XPS, SEM, TGA, ICP&#8208;MS and BET, as well as through stepwise synthesis verification. Evaluation of the catalytic performance revealed the ionic liquid composite delivered chloropropylene carbonate (CPC) in excellent yield and selectivity from either pure CO2 or simulated flue gas at 60 &#176;C and relatively lower pressure. Additionally, the DIL@PDIL catalyst exhibited good recyclability and were applicable to a range of epoxide substrates. The high activity of the the catalyst could be attributed to the abundant [TMGH]+ hydrogen bonding donors and Br&#8722; anions, which synergistically catalyze the epoxide ring&#8208;opening, as well as the abundant &#8208;COO&#8722; groups and imidazole cations, which facilitate the adsorption and activation of CO2.

         <title>A Shape&#8208;Memory and Durable Transparent Polyacrylate Film Integrated by Soft&#8208;Rigid Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a rational design strategy of flexible polyacrylate (PA) films with high transparency, shape memory, excellent abrasion resistance and foldability, for making the fabrication of transparent flexible displays or other flexible devices. The films are prepared by free&#8208;radical polymerisation of vinyl&#8208;terminated PU prepolymer as cross&#8208;linking agent and various acrylate monomers with the soft rigid chains under UV light.







Abstract
Flexible film in display requires multi&#8208;functional integration, such as stretchability, flexibility, abrasion resistance, transparency, and shape memory. In this paper, a reasonable design strategy of flexible polyacrylate (PA) film with high transparency, shape memory, excellent abrasion resistance and foldability is presented. The PA films are prepared by free radical polymerization of vinyl&#8208;terminated polyurethane (PU) prepolymer as a cross&#8208;linking agent and acrylate monomers in ultraviolet (UV) light. The various acrylate monomers in PA films with different functional groups (e.&#8201;g. epoxy groups, benzene rings) provide soft&#8208;rigid chains and hydrogen bonds, which improve overall mechanical and optical properties. The experimental results also effectively demonstrate that after folding performance (500 cycles) or abrasion resistance (1000 cycles), the transparency of PA film remained above 91&#8201;%. In addition, the PA films with different folded shapes also prove excellent shape memory, which can fix the folded shape at low temperature and then return to the original shape at room temperature. Notably, the PA film is successfully applied to the curved touch screen through drawing, pattern decoding and image magnification in the simulation practical demonstration, fully revealing its great significance as a flexible substrate in the development of future flexible displays.

Grafting of polyglycerol (PG) onto graphene oxide (GO) is initiated by: 1) a spontaneous reaction of epoxide with carboxyl groups at the edge of GO and those oxidized from aldehydes, and 2) a GO catalyzed reaction of the epoxides with the hydroxyl groups. GO also catalyzes the subsequent polymerization of glycidol on growing PG to afford a ramified PG macromolecule with a random branch&#8208;on&#8208;branch topology.







Abstract
Grafting carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials (CNMs) with polyglycerol (PG) improves their application potentials in biomedicine and electronics. Although &#8220;grafting from&#8221; method offers advantages over &#8220;grafting to&#8221; one in terms of operability and versatility, little is known about the reaction process of glycidol with the surface groups onto CNMs. By using graphene oxide (GO) as a multi&#8208;functional model material, we examined the reactivity of the surface groups on GO toward glycidol molecules via a set of model reactions. We reveal that carboxyl groups spontaneously react with the epoxide ring with no need of catalyst, while GO catalyzes the reactions of hydroxyl groups with the epoxide of glycidol. In addition, the hydroxyl group of glycidol can open the epoxide in the basal plane of GO. The subsequent polymerization of PG is supposed to propagate at the primary and/or the secondary hydroxyl groups, generating a ramified PG macromolecule with random branch&#8208;on&#8208;branch topology. In addition, ketones, benzyl esters and aromatic ethers are found not to react with glycidol even in the presence of GO, while the aldehydes are easily oxidized into carboxyl groups under ambient condition, behaving then as the carboxyl groups. Our findings pose the foundation for understanding the polymerization mechanism of PG on CNMs.

         <title>Selective Decarboxylative Fluorination of &#946;&#8208;Keto Acids in Aqueous Media: 19F&#8208;NMR&#8208;Assisted Batch Optimization and Transfer to Continuous Flow</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of API relevant &#945;&#8208;fluoro ketone phenacyl fluoride is finally described as a catalyst&#8208;free continuous flow process. This selective decarboxylative monofluorination is optimized in batch mode for aqueous and biocompatible conditions varying temperature, additives, and pH. Furthermore, benchtop NMR PAT was used for fundamental studies to a better understanding of the mechanism of the decarboxylative fluorination as well as the reaction pathways to &#945;&#8208;difluorinated ketone derivatives.







Abstract
The selective decarboxylative fluorination of 3&#8208;oxo&#8208;3&#8208;phenylpropionic acid is used as a benchmark reaction to optimize it under biocompatible conditions in batch and to transfer it to continuous flow mode. The reaction conditions are varied with respect to temperature, fluorinating reagents, inorganic base additives, and pH, as these parameters have been identified as having a significant impact on the process. The formation of the products and any by&#8208;products is analyzed using gas chromatography (GC) and 19F nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). Once optimal conditions have been determined, the reaction is carried out using an automated continuous laboratory synthesis system that features a mesostructured capillary reactor and an integrated 19F&#8208;NMR spectrometer for real&#8208;time monitoring of the reaction. The work presented here represents the initial phase of a multi&#8208;step continuous flow process that will include additional biocatalyzed downstream reactions in future applications.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An unprecedented formal [1+5] cyclization of indoline&#8208;derived azadienes with 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes has been realized, providing a facile access to biologically important indoline&#8208;spiro&#8208;hexahydropyrimidines with good to excellent yields (up to 99% yield). Different from previous reports, this is the first study that indoline&#8208;derived azadienes could participate in cyclizations as one&#8208;atom synthons. This methodology is also distinguished by not involving any additive or catalyst, readily available starting materials, wide range of substrate applicability, operational simplicity and simultaneously reassembling two C&#8208;N&#160;and two C&#8208;C bonds in one&#8208;step reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Oxidation of Methane to Methanol on a Zeolitic Octahedral Metal Oxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct oxidation of methane to methanol utilizing molecular oxygen under mild conditions is an important yet challenging process due to the difficulty in activation of methane under such conditions. In this research, we report zeolitic octahedral metal oxides based on cobalt vanadotungstates, which act as the catalysts for oxidation of methane using molecular oxygen as the oxidant without co&#8208;reductants at a low temperature of 90 oC even as low as 60 oC. This catalytic process results in the high&#8208;yield production of methanol as the major product. Micropores of the catalyst is critical for achieving high activity in the reaction, in which molecular oxygen is activated. The active species of the reaction is found to be hydroxyl&#8208;based species. VO5 with reduced V4+ and Co2+ are both crucial for generating the active species for the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Piezochromic Luminescence of Pyrene Derivatives&#160;Polymorphism around Excimer Forming Processs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyrene aggregates, as classic luminescent materials, are of great interest from a scientific viewpoint owing to the development of optoelectronic materials. In this study, we designed a compound&#160;1,4,5&#8208;triphenyl&#8208;2&#8208;(pyren&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole&#160;(IM&#8208;PY) which was achieved with two crystalline polymorphs (IMPY&#8208;G and IMPY&#8208;B). They exhibit the green emission and the blue emission, respectively, both with pyrene serving as the luminescent core. At&#160;ambient conditions, both phases exhibit &#960;&#8208;&#960;&#160;pyrene dimer stacking, but IMPY&#8208;B has the obviously smaller overlapping area and slightly shorter distance of pyrene planes than IMPY&#8208;G. During compression, the experiment results of photoluminescence, in situ UV&#8208;vis absorption, time&#8208;resolved emission, and synchrotron angular dispersive X&#8208;ray diffraction, combined with theoretical calculations indicate that IMPY&#8208;B shows a more pronounced red&#8208;shifted photoluminescence spectra and forms excimers at higher pressure than IMPY&#8208;G. This fully reflects the influence of different stacking structures on the piezochromic phenomenon of aggregates, which is beneficial for expanding the application of pyrene aggregated state.</dc:description>

         <title>Nucleophilic Functionalization of a Cationic Pentaphosphole Complex &#8211; A Systematic Study of Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The systematic nucleophilic functionalization of the cationic pentaphosphole ligand complex [Cp*Fe(&#951;4&#8208;P5Me)][OTf] (A) with group 16/17 nucleophiles is reported. This method represents a highly reliable and versatile strategy for the design of novel transition&#8208;metal complexes featuring twofold substituted end&#8208;deck cyclo&#8208;P5 ligands, bearing unprecedented hetero&#8208;element substituents. By the reaction of A with classical group 16 nucleophiles, complexes of the type [Cp*Fe(&#951;4&#8208;P5MeE)] (E = OEt (1), OtBu (2), SPh (3), SePh (4)) are obtained. By transferring this protocol to group 17 nucleophiles, the highly sensitive complexes [Cp*FeP5(&#951;4&#8208;P5MeX)] (X = F (5), Cl (6), Br (7), I (8)) could be isolated. All products show exclusively 1,1&#180;&#8208;substitution at the cyclo&#8208;P5 ring. Interestingly, further studies on the reactivity of the halogenated species revealed their ability to undergo ring&#8208;opening reactions with cyclic ethers such as THF and ethylene oxide yielding [Cp*FeP5(&#951;4&#8208;P5MeOC4H8X)] (X = Br (9), I (10)) or [Cp*FeP5(&#951;4&#8208;P5MeOC2H4X)] (X = Br (11), I (12)), respectively. Furthermore, the use of acyclic ethers such as dimethoxyethane led to the formation of [Cp*FeP5(&#951;4&#8208;P5MeOC2H4OCH3)] (13) mediated by C&#8208;O bond cleavage, followed by subsequent P&#8208;O bond formation, as further enlightened by DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Geometric Effects on C&#8208;C Coupling of Aryl&#8208;Carbenes under 2D Confinement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is well established that the confinement of reactants to two dimensions influences their reactivity. However, such confinement is often dominated by charge transfer effects between the reactants and the confining walls, in particular if the walls are conductive. Also, the reactivity of carbenes on metal surfaces is significantly affected by the charge transfer between the carbene and the metal, rendering the carbene more nucleophilic or electrophilic. Here, we investigate the geometrical effects of 2D confinement without an influence of the supporting metal for a photoinduced reaction of an aryl carbene on an ionic decoupling layer. We demonstrate the decoupling concept for the C&#8211;C coupling of 3&#8208;methoxy&#8208;9&#8208;fluorenylidene (C14H10O) on a NaBr(100) bilayer on Ag(111). We combine scanning tunneling microscopy with infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy to follow the photoinduced C&#8211;C coupling of the carbene from its diazo&#8208;protected precursor in two dimensions. Our study demonstrates that the NaBr decoupling bilayer efficiently suppresses the effects of the metal surface, facilitating carbene chemistry under geometrical confinement.</dc:description>

         <title>Under&#8208;strain Synergistic Oscillatory Twisting Manipulates the Bifunction&#160;in Rubrene Crystal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photophysical properties of condensed systems generally originate from collective contributions of all components in their stochastically fluctuated structures and are strongly influenced under strain of chromophores. To precisely identify how the stochastically fluctuated monomers synergistically manipulate the properties, we propose a statistic strategy over sufficient ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) samplings and for the first time uncover that synergistic oscillatory twisting (SOT) of neighboring under&#8208;strain monomers manipulates the bifunction of rubrene crystal.&#160; The under&#8208;strain trunk SOT can regulate both singlet fission (SF) and  triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA), enabling their coexistence and dominance switching by dynamically modulating the matching of excitation energies.&#160; A general rule is that small amplitude of SOT maintains the crystal TTA, while the large one boosts SF and the SF function occurs only when two neighboring monomers simultaneously have the twisting angles larger than the critical one.&#160; Temperature can govern the twisting amplitudes, thus manipulating the bifunction. These findings rationalize the experimentally observed temperature&#8208;modulated bifunction of rubrene crystal from statistical insights and proposes a combined strain&#8208;fluctuation strategy for engineering the bifunctionality of materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetrabutylammonium Chlorite as an Efficient Oxidant for Controlled Oxidation of Sulfides to Sulfoxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Considering the demand for organosulfur materials and the challenges associated with currently used oxidation processes, in this study, we evaluated the counter&#8208;cation of sodium chlorite (Na+ClO2&#8211;) with tetrabutylammonium chloride (Bu4N+Cl&#8211;) to synthesise tetrabutylammonium chlorite (Bu4N+ClO2&#8211;). Bu4N+ClO2&#8211;&#160;exhibited good solubility in organic solvents like chloroform (1.6 g mL&#8211;1) and ethyl acetate (0.86 g mL&#8211;1). The oxygenation reaction of organosulfides with Bu4N+ClO2&#8211;&#160;was examined in an HCl&#8208;acidic ethyl acetate solution under ambient conditions, selectively forming the corresponding sulfoxides as mono&#8208;oxygenated products. The reaction was initiated by the formation of chlorine dioxide (ClO2&#8226;) as an oxidant and an active species generated from Bu4N+ClO2&#8211;&#160;with HCl. This oxygenation method also enables the surface oxidation of sulfide polymers like polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) resins to increase their surface hydrophilicity. Therefore, the use of Bu4N+ClO2&#8211;&#160;for applications in organic solvents is an environment&#8208;friendly, efficient, and highly selective approach for selective oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Overcoming the Tradeoff Between Reaction Rate and Overpotential in Dinuclear Cobalt Complex Catalyzed Electrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study focuses on enhancing the water oxidation reaction (WOR) efficacy of dinuclear cobalt complex catalysts from both kinetic (turnover frequency, TOF) and thermodynamic (overpotential, &#951;) perspectives. For this purpose, we synthesized six dinuclear cobalt complexes 1&#8211;6 comprising non&#8208;innocent ligands with different electronically active substituents (&#8208;OMe (1), &#8208;Me (2), &#8208;H (3), &#8208;F (4), &#8208;Cl (5), and &#8208;CN (6)). The electronic effects on the electrochemical WOR under neutral, acidic, and alkaline conditions were investigated experimentally and computationally. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed that the valence state of the cobalt complexes was affected by electronic effects, affording different catalytic potentials, as evidenced by electrochemical measurements. Kinetic and spectroscopic studies confirmed that the synergistic effect of catalyst identity and reaction media changes the reaction mechanism of each catalyst. The WOR performance of 1&#8211;6 was tunable through ligand electronics and solvent effects, with the log(TOF)&#8208;&#951; analysis highlighting an operational &#951; as low as 40 mV. This study provides valuable insights into optimizing WOR catalysis through molecular design and environmental tuning.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bonding situation in [Fp&#8211;P4][Al(ORF)4] (1) (Fp = (CO)2CpFe, RF = C(CF3)3) gives rise to an Umpolung of the P4 fragment, which should make it accessible for nucleophiles. To investigate this projected reactivity, the complex was combined with a series of hydroxy&#8208;nucleophiles &#8211; that all do not react with free P4 &#8211; leading to a variety of P1 building blocks. With excess of R&#8208;OH (R&#160;= Me, Et, Ph), the thermodynamically more stable complex salts [Fp&#8211;P(H)x(OR)3&#8211;x)][Al(ORF)4] (x&#160;=&#160;2,1,0) (2b&#8209;2d) are formed and show that the phosphonium type pathway is accessible. Quantum chemical calculations display a variety of reaction pathways that all lead very rapidly to the P1 building blocks. With stoichiometric amounts of R&#8208;OH, [Fp&#8211;PH3][Al(ORF)4] (2a) as well as [HP(OR)3][Al(ORF)4] (2f) were observed as products. Hence, activation of the P4&#8208;cage in complex 1 was confirmed.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we present a simple gold&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot reaction of easily available diarylbutadiynes, with trimethoxybenzene as solvent and reactant to synthesize 4,6,8&#8208;trimethoxyazulenes. The methoxy substituents, which render the azulene very electron&#8208;rich, enable a change of azulenes typical regioselectivity for electrophilic substitutions, which enables facile electrophilic 2&#8208;substitution with iodine, bromine, chlorine, selenium or sulfur. Especially the 2&#8208;haloazulenes which can usually only be obtained through lengthy multistep syntheses are valuable building blocks for the synthesis of 2&#8208;substituted azulene derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Conversion of Carbon Dioxide to Long Chain Esters via Formate Hydroesterification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CO2&#8208;based hydroesterification is an attractive route to produce value added ester compounds, which could replace&#160;CO&#8208;based hydroesterification processes if sufficient catalytic technologies are developed. One path to CO2&#8208;based hydroesterification is through an organoformate intermediate, which is then used in olefin hydroesterification to generate the desirable esters.&#160; This route creates&#160;a net CO2&#8208;based hydroesterification process using tandem catalytic systems for CO2 hydrogenation to organoformate paired with formate&#8208;olefin hydroesterification. The tandem use of tripodal phosphine ruthenium(II) and 1,2&#8208;bis(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphinomethyl)benzene palladium catalysts were found to successfully produce methyl nonanoate from CO2, H2, methanol and 1&#8208;octene in a single&#8208;stage batch process. The CO2&#8208;based hydroesterification catalysis efficiency was found to be largely limited by the productivity of organoformate generation and competitive 1&#8208;octene reduction.&#160; Catalytic yields of methyl nonanoate can be enhanced by adjustments in reaction procedures, including the use of a two&#8208;stage batch reaction process or delayed introduction of 1&#8208;octene, achieving a yield of up to 32%. Under select conditions, control experiments indicate yields of methyl nonanoate can be improved to ca 75%. Preliminary studies indicate significant interplay between the two ligands employed in the molecular tandem catalytic systems and establish the first catalytic protocol for the selective CO2&#8208;based hydroesterification of olefins via organoformates.</dc:description>

A multifunctional Ru&#8722;Re complex ability to generate singlet oxygen and carbon monoxide for plaque degradation and neuroprotection. This visual metaphor emphasizes the innovative therapeutic potential of metal complexes in neurodegenerative research.







Abstract
The development of multifunctional therapeutic agents is crucial for addressing complex diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Herein, we report a ruthenium&#8208;rhenium (Ru&#8722;Re) complex that combines photodynamic therapy (PDT) and carbon monoxide (CO) generation capabilities. The Ru&#8722;Re complex shows promising photophysical property and significant therapeutic potential. Our studies reveal the complex's ability to generate singlet oxygen (1O2), CO, inhibit tau aggregation, and enhance mitochondrial respiration. These multifunctional properties position the Ru&#8722;Re complex as a versatile tool for therapeutic applications in Alzheimer's disease.

         <title>Porous Organic Polymers for CO2 Capture and Catalytic Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the preparation of four types of porous organic polymers is briefly summarized, followed by a discussion of the effects of physical and chemical adsorption on carbon dioxide capture by porous materials. Finally, the effects of the type of adsorption on the chemical and photocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide are discussed, and the prospects of chemical adsorption for carbon dioxide capture and conversion at low concentrations are presented.







Abstract
Overuse of fossil fuels and anthropogenic activities have led to excessive emissions of carbon dioxide, leading to global warming, and measures to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are needed to overcome this global challenge. Therefore, exploring an environmentally friendly strategy for capturing airborne CO2 and converting it into high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals offers a promising pathway toward &#8220;carbon neutrality&#8221;. In recent years, porous organic polymers have attracted much attention for carbon capture and the catalytic conversion of carbon dioxide because of their high specific surface area, high chemical stability, nanoscale porosity, and structural versatility, which make them easy to functionalize. In this review, we introduce the preparation methods for various POPs, the types of POPs adsorbed during carbon dioxide capture, and the progress in the use of POPs for the photocatalytic and chemicatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide, with a special discussion on the influence of adsorption type on the efficiency of catalytic conversion. Finally, we propose a prospective direction for the subsequent development of this field.

         <title>Highly Selective Cytokine Induction of Nitrated Lipid&#8208;Modified &#945;&#8208;GalCer Derivatives Demonstrating High Binding Affinity to the Lipid Antigen Presenting Molecule CD1d</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel &#945;&#8208;GalCer containing natural nitro&#8208;modified fatty acyl groups were synthesized and discovered to have highly selective Th2 and Th17 cytokine induction ability. The nitroalkene group of glycolipids at the CD1d binding site is inferred to interact with polar and aromatic amino acids, leading to a significant effect on the immunomodulatory functions.







Abstract
Glycolipid antigens are presented by CD1d on antigen&#8208;presenting cells to T cell receptors (TCRs) of natural killer T (NKT) cells, leading to immune responses via cytokine induction. Although various lipid antigens have been found, there are only a limited number of glycolipid antigens having selective cytokine induction. In this study, we identified the glycolipids (&#945;&#8208;GalCer nitro&#8208;type) that exhibit highly selective induction of Th2 and Th17 type cytokines, with very high binding affinity to CD1d, by introducing nature&#8208;inspired nitro&#8208;modified fatty acyl groups. The natural nitroalkene moiety of fatty acyl groups in the glycolipids effectively enhances the affinity to CD1d through presumed hydrogen&#8208;bonding and NO2&#8211;&#960; interactions, leading to the distinctive function in cytokine induction and selectivity.

         <title>Unveiling the Potential of Thiophene&#8208;Functionalized Porous Organic Polymers for Bromine Adsorption and Selective Separation from Iodine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bromine causes significant environmental pollution, contributes to ozone layer depletion, and coexists with iodine as IBr. In this study, we have developed an electron&#8208;rich porous organic polymer (POF&#8208;2) containing heteroatoms that effectively adsorbs bromine and shows selectivity over iodine. The efficient adsorption of bromine is facilitated by non&#8208;covalent charge transfer interaction, specifically physisorption with the POF&#8208;2 network.







Abstract
Bromine is a significant environmental threat due to its corrosive nature and contribution to ozone layer depletion. It often coexists with iodine and forms interhalogen complexes (IBr), which require an effective and selective bromine adsorption strategy. Leveraging the electrophilic nature of bromine, we designed an electron&#8208;rich thiophene&#8208;based porous organic polymer (POF&#8208;2). This material exhibits exceptional efficiency for bromine adsorption (2.86&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1) and rapid uptake kinetic from aqueous solutions, driven by noncovalent charge transfer interactions. POF&#8208;2 also demonstrates selective capture of bromine from a bromine&#8208;iodine mixture in cyclohexane. The material's electron&#8208;rich sites exhibit a stronger orbital interaction with the &#963;* orbital of bromine compared to iodine, leading to the observed selectivity in cyclohexane.

         <title>The Impact of Single Amino Acid Insertion on the Supramolecular Assembly Pathway of Aromatic Peptide Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elucidating supramolecular polymerization mechanisms is crucial for designing customizable supramolecular biomaterials. Here we investigate supramolecular assembly of Fmoc&#8208;L2QG with unusual concentration&#8208;dependent assembly, forming fibrous assemblies at low concentrations and metastable supramolecular droplets via liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation at higher concentrations. Inserting just one leucine unit in Fmoc&#8208;L3QG leads to competing assembly pathways, but formation of fibrous morphologies regardless of concentration.







Abstract
Understanding the mechanism of self&#8208;assembly driven by non&#8208;covalent interactions is crucial for designing supramolecular materials with desired properties. Here we investigate the self&#8208;assembly of aromatic peptide amphiphiles, Fmoc&#8208;L2QG and Fmoc&#8208;L3QG using a combination of spectroscopic, transmission electron and superresolution optical microscopy techniques. Our results show that Fmoc&#8208;L2QG leads to concentration&#8208;dependent assembly, forming fibrous assemblies at low concentrations and supramolecular droplets via liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) at higher concentrations. Mechanical activation using for example ultrasonication triggered the transition from metastable droplets to fibre morphologies of Fmoc&#8208;L2QG. In contrast, Fmoc&#8208;L3QG followed both on&#8208;pathway and off&#8208;pathway routes, resulting in the formation of fibrous morphologies regardless of concentration. Seeding experiments revealed that homo&#8208;seeds of the same peptide sequence accelerated the on&#8208;pathway process, while hetero&#8208;seeds of a mismatched peptide sequences accelerated the off&#8208;pathway process, highlighting the competing nature of the complex assembly profile. These findings demonstrate the significant impact of single amino acid insertion on the supramolecular assembly process of oligopeptide monomers, and highlight the potential for controlling the structure and dynamics of peptide materials. Pathway engineering of oligopeptide building blocks and multidomain supramolecular monomers will open new avenues in tailor&#8208;made and customizable supramolecular biomaterials.

         <title>Mechanism&#8208;Guided Development of Bifunctional Cyclooctenes as Active, Practical, and Light&#8208;Gated Bromination Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanistic studies guided the development of bifunctional trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) catalysts bearing a functionalized benzyl group. TCO with a para&#8208;hydroxybenzyl group is particularly active, and the functionalization allowed more practical cis&#8208;cyclooctenes (CCOs) to be used as active catalysts. By using a photochemically labile masking group on the para&#8208;hydroxybenzyl substituent, the first light&#8208;gated bromination catalyst was developed, enabling spatiotemporal control of the transformation.







Abstract
Most molecular catalysts have been developed employing polar functional groups as catalytic sites. However, the use of non&#8208;polar functional groups for catalysis has received less attention due to their modest molecular interactions while the bioorthogonal reactivity of non&#8208;polar alkenes as substrates is frequently used in click chemistry. In this study, we conducted mechanistic studies on the catalysis of trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) derivatives with the strained olefin as the catalytic site using kinetic and computational analyses to aid the design of more active olefin catalysts. The analysis reveals the significant role of the benzyl substituents in accelerating the generation of bromonium species through dispersion interaction in the rate&#8208;determining step. Guided by the mechanistic insights, we developed bifunctional TCO catalysts bearing a functionalized benzyl group, taking advantage of the remarkable substituent effects. Experimental studies confirmed the theoretical model and revealed that TCO with a para&#8208;hydroxybenzyl group provided excellent catalytic activity. Furthermore, inclusion of the functionalized benzyl groups allowed more readily available and robust cis&#8208;cyclooctenes to be used as active catalysts, expanding the practical utility of the olefin catalysts. By using a photochemically labile masking group on the para&#8208;hydroxybenzyl substituent, the first light&#8208;gated bromination catalyst was developed, enabling spatiotemporal control of the transformation.

         <title>Quinizarin Gold(I) N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Complexes with Synergistic Activity Against Anthracycline&#8208;Resistant Leukaemia Cells: Synthesis and Biological Activity Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents new quinizarin&#8208;Au(I)&#8208;NHC complexes with high cytotoxicity against cancer cells and resistance breaking properties. Importantly, the intracellular localisation of the complex proved more important than overall cytotoxicity alone towards overcoming acquire drug resistance in two leukaemia cell models.







Abstract
New, asymmetric quinizarin&#8208;Au(I)&#8208;NHC complexes were designed, isolated, and fully characterised including by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. Cytotoxicity studies showed effective growth inhibition in HeLa cervical cancer cells with IC50 values ranging from 2.4&#8197;&#956;M to 5.3&#8197;&#956;M. The successful cellular uptake was evidenced by X&#8208;ray fluorescence imaging on cryo&#8208;preserved whole HeLa cells and the sub&#8208;cellular localisation was monitored by live&#8208;cell fluorescence microscopy. Notably, complex 2&#8201;b showed circumvention of acquired anthracycline resistance in K562 leukaemia cells as well as synergistic activity with doxorubicin against both wild&#8208;type and anthracycline&#8208;resistant Nalm&#8208;6 leukaemia cells. Interestingly, sub&#8208;cellular localisation towards mitochondria proved to be more important than the compounds&#8217; overall cytotoxicity for potent antiproliferative activity and to achieve effective resistance circumvention.

         <dc:description>
Selenium&#8208;annulated perylene bisimide bearing swallow tail at imide position stabilizes room temperature columnar hexagonal phase with exceptionally low clearing temperature. This compound exhibits ambipolar charge carrier mobility and distinguishes itself to an exclusive class of solution&#8208;processable, self&#8208;assembled liquid crystalline organic semiconductors.







Abstract
This study presents a selenium&#8208;annulated perylene bisimide (PBI&#8208;SeST) stabilizing room temperature columnar hexagonal phase with exceptionally low clearing temperature. The synthesis of this Se&#8208;annulated PBI (PBI&#8208;SeST) was accomplished using the reductive Cadogan cyclization method, with the introduction of swallow tails to reduce the clearing temperature and improve solubility. In addition, the charge carrier mobility of the Se&#8208;bay annulated PBI is assessed by space charge limited current (SCLC) technique and juxtaposed with PBI as well as nitrogen and sulphur&#8208;bay&#8208;annulated PBIs. It is noteworthy that all these PBIs exhibited ambipolar charge carrier mobility, a characteristic that diverges from the prevailing literature where predominantly electron transport behavior was observed for PBIs. This distinguishes them as an exclusive category of solution&#8208;processable, self&#8208;assembling organic semiconductors.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Functional Sulfur&#8208;Rich Copolymers for Stable Anchoring and Enhanced Conversion of Polysulfide in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Fe1&#8208;xS/C dispersed and Se&#8208;containing sulfur&#8208;rich polymer was synthesized for Li&#8722;S batteries by one&#8208;pot reaction of ferrocene, trithiocyanuric acid with SexSy, which delivered a remarkable capacity of 734.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;C under high sulfur loading (4.08&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and low E/S ratio (6&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1).







Abstract
Sulfur&#8208;rich copolymers have gained a great deal of attention as promising cathode materials in Li&#8722;S batteries due to their low cost and naturally uniform sulfur dispersion. However, the poor electrical conductivity and shuttle effect cause rapid capacity decay and low sulfur utilization especially under high sulfur loading and low electrolyte/sulfur ratio. Herein, the Fe1&#8208;xS/C dispersed and Se&#8208;containing sulfur&#8208;rich copolymer (FSP) was synthesized by one&#8208;pot reaction of ferrocene, trithiocyanuric acid with SexSy. In such process, the trithiocyanuric acid reacts with SexSy to form Se&#8208;containing sulfur&#8208;rich copolymers. Simultaneously, ferrocene reacts with sulfur to form highly dispersed Fe1&#8208;xS/C within sulfur&#8208;rich copolymers. The covalent chemical binding of sulfur in the FSP effectively suppress the shuttle effect of polysulfides by chemical binding. Meanwhile, the Se improves the conductivity of FSP, which enhances the reaction kinetics.

&lt;p&gt;A Fe&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;S/C dispersed and Se-containing sulfur-rich polymer was synthesized for Li&#8722;S batteries by one-pot reaction of ferrocene, trithiocyanuric acid with Se&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, which delivered a remarkable capacity of 734.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.2&#8197;C under high sulfur loading (4.08&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and low E/S ratio (6&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sulfur-rich copolymers have gained a great deal of attention as promising cathode materials in Li&#8722;S batteries due to their low cost and naturally uniform sulfur dispersion. However, the poor electrical conductivity and shuttle effect cause rapid capacity decay and low sulfur utilization especially under high sulfur loading and low electrolyte/sulfur ratio. Herein, the Fe&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;1-x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;S/C dispersed and Se-containing sulfur-rich copolymer (FSP) was synthesized by one-pot reaction of ferrocene, trithiocyanuric acid with Se&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;. In such process, the trithiocyanuric acid reacts with Se&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; to form Se-containing sulfur-rich copolymers. Simultaneously, ferrocene reacts with sulfur to form highly dispersed Fe&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;1-x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;S/C within sulfur-rich copolymers. The covalent chemical binding of sulfur in the FSP effectively suppress the shuttle effect of polysulfides by chemical binding. Meanwhile, the Se improves the conductivity of FSP, which enhances the reaction kinetics. Moreover, the highly dispersed Fe&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;1-x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;S/C in the FSP is able to effectively catalyze polysulfide conversion and inhibit the shuttle effect. As a result, the optimized FSP electrode exhibits a high capacity of 1330&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.2&#8197;C. Even under high sulfur loading (4.08&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and low E/S ratio (6&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), the FSP cathode demonstrates a remarkable capacity of 734.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.2&#8197;C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Dehydrogenation using Reusable Ni&#8208;immobilized MOF catalyst: Herein, we have demonstrated synthesis of a novel Ni&#8208;immobilized MOF as heterogeneous catalyst for the dehydrogenation of N&#8208;heterocycles. A series of five and six&#8208;membered N&#8208;heteroarenes were synthesized in up to 98&#8201;% yield (&gt;33 examples). Synthesis of pharmaceuticals were obtained under milder reactions conditions. Detailed characterization of the fresh catalyst and reused catalyst were performed using SEM, TEM, BET, PXRD, and EDX elemental mappings. The catalyst could be recycled up to four&#8208;times, mechanistic studies were performed including detection of H2 and H2O2 and suggested the involvement of enamine&#8208;imine intermediate species for sequential dehydrogenation.







Abstract
Herein, we have demonstrated the design and synthesis of a novel Ni&#8208;immobilized MOF as heterogeneous catalyst for the dehydrogenation of N&#8208;heterocycles. A series of five and six&#8208;membered N&#8208;heteroarenes bearing one or more heteroatoms were synthesized in up to 98&#8201;% yield (&gt;33 examples). Late stage functionalization to the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;glucuronides inhibitor, antimalarial drug quinine, and the nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug (NSAID) indomethacin were obtained under milder reactions conditions. A series of mechanistic studies revealed the detection of H2 and H2O2 during the progress of the reactions and suggested the involvement of enamine&#8208;imine intermediate species for sequential dehydrogenation. Detailed characterization of the fresh catalyst and reused catalyst were performed using SEM, TEM, BET, PXRD, and EDX elemental mappings. The catalyst could be recycled up to four&#8208;times without much loss in catalytic activities. In&#8208;situ formed defects, pore size enlargement and additional Lewis acid sites within catalyst nanocrystals assisted in attaining high activity and selectivity to N&#8208;heteroarenes.

         <title>Synthesis of Lewis Acid&#8208;Base Adducts Between Potassium Dihydrogenpnictogenides and Group 13 Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work we investigated the Lewis acid&#8208;base properties of potassium dihydrogenpnictogenides and potassium bis(trimethylsilyl)pnictogenides towards different trialkyl trieles (Triel=B&#8722;In) and BH3. The presented compounds were investigated by X&#8208;ray structure analysis, NMR spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy and elemental analysis.







Abstract
Lewis acid&#8208;base adducts between potassium dihydrogenpnictogenides [K(18c6)PnH2] (Pn=P, As) and Trialkylgallanes (GaMe3, GaEt3, GatBu3) as well as BH3 were synthesized. In the course of these investigations, we were able to fully characterize a row of compounds of the type [K(18c6)(thf)0&#8208;2][PnH2(ER3)2] (E=B: R=H; E=Ga: R=Me, Et, tBu). Based on the successful syntheses of these species, we also synthesized several compounds of the composition [K(18c6)(thf)0&#8208;2][Pn(SiMe3)2(ER3)n] (n=1, 2) starting from [KPn(SiMe3)2] (Pn=P and As) and ER3 (E=B, Al, In: R=Me; E=Ga: R=Me, Et, tBu). All isolated compounds, were examined by NMR spectroscopy, infra&#8208;red spectroscopy and elemental analysis. A selection of the compounds presented were also examined by means of X&#8208;ray structure analysis on the single crystal. The obtained adducts of negatively charged [PnH2]&#8722; and [Pn(SiMe3)2]&#8722; fragments with Lewis acids are a class of compounds that has scarcely been investigated to date.

The quinoline/quinazoline hybridized pseudo trimeric macrocycle, DiQuinoline(Q)&#8208;MonoQuinazolines(Qz), Q2Qz1, was readily synthesized from the key macrocyclic amide precursor in a modular fashion. Its central cavity strongly captures a proton, and the thus&#8208;formed positively charged, highly planar architecture exhibits supramolecular complexation through &#960;&#8208;interactions. Q2Qz1, with its unique properties, was applied as a scavenger for toxic polyaromatic hydrocarbons and as a G&#8208;quartet ligand for potential therapeutic agent for cancer chemotherapy.

         <title>Improved H2O2 Photogeneration on KBr Doped&#8208;Polymeric Carbon Nitride Via Optimize the Oxygen Reduction Path</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, K and Br doped carbon nitride&#8208;based photocatalysts were synthesized by one&#8208;pot method, which is conducive to the transmission of space charge and oxygen activation, promotes the efficient production of H2O2 by 2e&#8722;ORR.







Abstract
The photosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from oxygen (O2) represents a promising catalytic pathway, the limited efficiency of the oxygen reduction constitutes a primary barrier to enhancing production. In this content, alkali metal potassium (K+) and Br&#8208;doped g&#8208;C3N4 photocatalysts (K&#8208;CN) were successfully constructed by one&#8208;pot method. The introduction of K+ is not only beneficial to the transmission of space charge and the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers, but also promotes the efficient production of H2O2 by 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction. The introduction of Br&#8722; promotes O2 converted to triplet state and triggers energy transfer process to increase 1O2 production, O2 adsorption was facilitated through regulating the oxygen evolution (O2&#8594;1O2), which is beneficial to the subsequent oxygen reduction process.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) from oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) represents a promising catalytic pathway, the limited efficiency of the oxygen reduction constitutes a primary barrier to enhancing production. In this content, alkali metal potassium (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and Br-doped g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; photocatalysts (K-CN) were successfully constructed by one-pot method. The introduction of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is not only beneficial to the transmission of space charge and the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers, but also promotes the efficient production of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; oxygen reduction reaction. The introduction of Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; promotes O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; converted to triplet state and triggers energy transfer process to increase &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption was facilitated through regulating the oxygen evolution (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which is beneficial to the subsequent oxygen reduction process. The results showed that the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yield of 0.05&#8197;K-CN catalyst reached 26.0&#8197;mmol&#8197;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which was more than 5 times that of pure g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Achieving Ultrabright NIR&#8208;II Nanofluorophore for In Vivo Imaging by Inhibiting H&#8208;Aggregates Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrabright NIR&#8208;II nanofluorophore, derived from a small molecule featuring a terminal unit&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;terminal unit structure, is achieved, benefiting from the small molecule possessing an ability to prevent H&#8208;aggregates formation during self&#8208;assembly. The exceptional NIR&#8208;II brightness enables the nanofluorophore in long&#8208;term and real&#8208;time NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging at low injection doses.







Abstract
Small molecules with an acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor (A&#8722;D&#8722;A) structure, featuring a fused&#8208;ring core as the donor and two electron&#8208;withdrawing end groups as acceptor units, represent a potential option for NIR&#8208;II fluorophores, benefiting from their narrow bandgaps, superior light&#8208;harvesting capabilities, and exceptional photostabilities. However, their planar conformations predispose them to forming H&#8208;aggregates during self&#8208;assembly, leading to significantly reduced fluorescence quantum yield (QY) of the resulting nanofluorophores. Herein, we report a small molecule, PF8CN, with a terminal unit&#8208;A&#8722;D&#8722;A&#8208;terminal unit structure. The terminal units of 3,5&#8208;bis(octyloxy)phenyl group result in a twisted conformation for PF8CN, preventing face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacking and thereby inhibiting the formation of H&#8208;aggregates. Consequently, the NIR&#8208;II fluorescence QY of PF8CN NPs is 3.8 times that of the model nanofluorophore (F8CN NPs), which contains a substantial amount of H&#8208;aggregates. The NIR&#8208;II brightness of PF8CN NPs is 5.3&#8208; and 14.9&#8208;times that of F8CN NPs and ICG/FBS, respectively, at an equal molar concentration. Such ultrahigh NIR&#8208;II brightness of PF8CN NPs allows us to perform long&#8208;term and real&#8208;time NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging of cerebral and hindlimb vessels, as well as the thrombolytic process. This work provides an effective method for producing nanofluorophores with ultrahigh NIR&#8208;II brightness, positioning PF8CN NPs as a strong contender in the field of NIR&#8208;II nanofluorophores.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Access to Pyrrolo&#8208; and (Aryl)Indolo&#8208;Fused Phenazines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;Extended phenazines with four to seven annulated rings were synthesized via gold&#8208;catalysis and Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig cross&#8208;coupling reactions. These N&#8208;heteropolycycles were studied using UV/Vis, fluorescence and X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, along with theoretical calculations, revealing interesting structural properties and optical band gaps as low as 2.12&#8197;eV.







Abstract
Novel fused phenazines were synthesized through a combination of gold&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination and cascade cyclization reactions towards azaacenes. In total, 30 new compounds were synthesized and investigated with respect to their structural and optoelectronic properties. In solution, these targets exhibit strong green to red emission, with quantum yields of up to 60&#8201;%. The emission wavelength can be finely adjusted by the choice of solvent due to their solvatochromic behavior, as demonstrated with a representative example.

         <dc:description>
In this study, the fundamental theories of solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries are systematically reviewed. Then, focusing on solid electrolytes, key challenges faced by solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries are systematically discussed, and the interface modification strategies of solid electrolytes are reviewed in detail. Finally, the future industrial development of sodium&#8208;ion solid&#8208;state batteries is prospected.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries have abundant sources of raw materials, uniform geographical distribution, and low cost, and it is considered an important substitute for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Thereinto, solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries have the advantages of low raw material cost, high safety, and high energy density, and it has shown great potential for application in the fields of mobile power, electric vehicles, and large&#8208;scale energy storage systems. However, the commercial development and large&#8208;scale application of solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries urgently need to address issues such as the low room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of solid electrolytes, high interfacial charge transfer impedance, and poor compatibility and contact between the solid electrolytes and the electrodes. Herein, this paper systematically discusses the basic theories of solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries, including working principles and characteristics, electrode materials and components, and solid electrolytes. Then, focusing on solid electrolytes, the key scientific challenges faced by solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries were systematically discussed, and the application of interface modification in enhancing solid&#8208;state electrolytes was reviewed. Finally, the future industrial development of solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries was prospected. This review helps to deepen the understanding of the interface scientific issues of solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries and provides theoretical guidance for its development and application. Furthermore, this review also provides the necessary engineering theoretical guidance to accelerate the large&#8208;scale commercial application of solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries, which has significant scientific value and profound social significance.

         <title>Electrochemically mediated synthesis of cyanated heterocycles from &#945;&#8208;amino esters, pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehydes and NH4SCN as cyano group source</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemically mediated cyanation/annulation process with in situ cyanide ion generation from NH4SCN and multi&#8208;step oxidative construction of CN&#8208;functionalized heterocycles from easily available &#945;&#8208;amino esters and pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehydes has been discovered. Depending on the nature of the &#945;&#8208;amino ester, 1&#8208;cyano&#8208;imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylates, 3&#8208;alkyl&#8208; and 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines&#8208;1&#8208;carbonitriles, and the first reported 4&#8208;oxo&#8208;4H&#8208;pyrido[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazine&#8208;1&#8208;carbonitriles were obtained. The electrosynthesis is carried out in an undivided electrochemical cell under constant current conditions. The success of the discovered electrochemical synthesis is based on the combination of two anodic processes: oxidation of SCN anion to CN anion and oxidation of C&#8208;N bonds to C=N bonds during heterocycle construction. Mechanistic studies based on CV measurements, and control experiments confirm the generation of [CN] species from NH4SCN with subsequent addition to an imine formed from &#945;&#8208;amino esters and pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehyde. Computational analysis suggests that for reactive intermediates from glycine esters, the subsequent 5&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization leading to 1&#8208;cyano&#8208;imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylates is more favourable and the 6&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization leading to 4&#8208;oxo&#8208;4H&#8208;pyrido[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazine&#8208;1&#8208;carbonitriles is less favourable.

         <title>Oxidative Neutralisation of Sulfur&#8208;based Chemical Warfare Agents Mediated by a Lipase: from Batch to Flow Reactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sulfur&#8208;containing chemical warfare agents sulfur mustard HD and nerve agent VX are highly toxic and persistent in the environment. Therefore, their neutralisation requires harsh oxidation conditions, but also precise selectivity. Here we report the safe and effective detoxification of surrogates CEES and PhX by selective oxidation of the sulfur atom by generating peracetic acid from AcOEt and aq. H2O2 assisted by the supported lipase CALB. Morever, it is possible to perform these neutralisations with safe &#8216;on demand&#8217; generation of AcOOH in a flow system by using a packed bed reactor containing the supported biocatalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed 1,4&#8208;Dichloromethyldimerization of Alkenes with Chloroform: Access to Polychlorinated Vicinal Diaryl Alkanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated strategy is reported for the direct synthesis of polychlorinated vicinal diaryl alkanes from aryl alkenes and chloroform. In this approach, two haloalkyl radicals generated from chloroform via halogen atom transfer (XAT) and direct single electron transfer (SET) within the same photoredox catalysis cycle enable the 1,4&#8208;dichloromethyldimerization of alkenes. Besides chloroform, this strategy is applicable to carbon tetrachloride, bromotrichloromethane, and &#945;&#8208;bromo carboxylic esters, yielding corresponding 1,4&#8208;disubstituted vicinal diaryl alkanes. Diverse polychlorinated structures containing highly congested vicinal quaternary carbon centers are effectively synthesized by this method. The potential of this reaction in late&#8208;stage drug modification is highlighted by the successful transformation of olefins with pharmaceutical structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Structures of Gas&#8208;Phase Hydrated Phosphotyrosine Revealed by Soft X&#8208;ray Action Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gas&#8208;phase near&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption mass spectrometry (NEXAMS) was employed at the carbon and oxygen K&#8208;edges to probe the influence of a single water molecule on
the protonated phosphotyrosine molecule. The results of the photodissociation experiments revealed that the water molecule forms two bonds, with the phosphate group and
another chemical group. By comparing the NEXAMS spectra at the carbon and oxygen K&#8208;edges with density functional theory calculations, we attributed the electronic transitions
responsible for the observed resonances, especially the transitions due to the presence of the water molecule. We showed that the water molecule leads to a specific spectral
feature in the partial ion yield of hydrated fragments at 536.4 eV. Moreover, comparing the NEXAMS spectra with the calculated structures allowed us to identify three
possible structures for singly hydrated phosphotyrosine that agree with the observed fragmentation and resonances.</dc:description>

         <title>A Fluorescent Probe Differentiates Apoptosis from Cysteine&#8208;Deprivation Ferroptosis through Imaging of Viscosity and Lipid Droplets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since death is an inevitable phenomenon, exploring cell deaths holds importance. During this process, the cellular microenvironment within cells such as pH, polarity, viscosity etc alter. One such microenvironment, viscosity elevates during different cell deaths. However, demarcating cell death processes solely based on viscosity sensing is challenging. Herein, we develop a unique fluorescent probe PS&#8208;NAP after careful investigation among three analogues for efficient viscosity imaging in HeLa cells. Cationic PS&#8208;NAP, a MMP independent molecular probe, can potentially target mitochondria and map elevated mitochondrial viscosity during apoptosis, starvation and drug induced ferroptosis processes. Notably, during ferroptosis induced by cysteine deprivation, PS&#8208;NAP exclusively colocalizes in newly generated lipid droplets (LDs) instead of mitochondria. Thus, the probe has a potential for demarcating cysteine deprivation&#8208;induced ferroptosis from other cellular stresses such as apoptosis.</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of Structural Subtleties on Chirality Induction and Amplification in Trizinc(II)porphyrin Trimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the precise control of molecular to supramolecular chirality induction at the single&#8208;molecule level just upon subtle modification in an achiral &#8216;nano&#8208;size&#8217; trizinc(II) porphyrin trimer. A slight variation in the projection of the substituent at the periphery of the central porphyrin unit in a porphyrin trimer (host) resulted in pronounced changes in the interchromophoric arrangement, leading to distinct &#8216;open&#8217; and &#8216;closed&#8217; conformations. While &#8216;open&#8217; form generates &#8216;monomeric&#8217; complex with low CD amplitude, &#8216;closed&#8217; form produces exclusive &#8216;polymer&#8217; with large, amplified CD signal with opposite sign due to stronger intermolecular excitonic coupling. Also, the sign of the CD couplets is just opposite between R and S substrates for both polymer and monomer which suggest that the chirality is predominantly governed by the stereogenic projection of the chiral center. X&#8208;ray structures of the host and polymer have been reported here. Crystallographic characterization offers a detailed perspective on the structural and geometrical transformations in the polymer, enabling a systematic understanding of its optical properties. DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations strongly corroborate with the experimental findings.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Deracemization: A Sustainable Approach to Enantiopurity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We introduce mechanochemical deracemization (MCDR) as a novel strategy for obtaining enantiopure compounds. This study demonstrates the successful transposition of six archetypical deracemization reactions from a solvent&#8208;based to a solvent&#8208;minimized ball milling environment. The scope includes a ketone, isoindolinones, imines, an ester, and an inorganic compound, all of which deracemized successfully. Key parameters such as milling material, ball number and size, the use of a bulk material and liquid&#8208;assisted grinding (LAG) were systematically investigated, revealing their crucial role. Quantitative enantiomeric excesses (e.e.) were achieved, while reaction times were reduced by up to 97% and solvent consumption by as much as 100%. This work establishes MCDR as a versatile, sustainable pathway to enantiopure compounds. By highlighting the generalizability of this approach and its huge potential for minimizing waste, this study provides the foundation for future advancements in mechanochemical deracemization.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoresponsive Helical Foldamers: Conformational Control through Double Helix Formation and Light&#8208;Induced Protonation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Helical foldamers constitute particularly relevant targets in the field of host&#8208;guest chemistry, be that as hosts or substrates. In this context, the strategies reported so far to control the dimensions and shape of foldamers mainly involve modifications of the skeleton through covalent synthesis. Herein, we prepared an oligopyridine dicarboxamide foldamer substituted by photo&#8208;active tetraphenylethylenes (TPE). We demonstrate that it is possible to toggle the length of a helical foldamer by two means. First, the elongation of foldamers can be tuned by adjusting the concentration, as demonstrated by DOSY NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses on both the single and the double helix structures. Secondly, and in a more original manner, a photo&#8208;induced protonation process triggered by TPE units promotes a novel pathway to unfold helical foldamers, leading to dramatic conformational and spectroscopic changes.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereospecific Radical Bromination of &#223;&#8208;Aryl Alcohols with Thiourea Additives Through A Serendipitous Discovery of A 1,2&#8208;Aryl Migration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of new protocols for stereospecific and stereoselective halogenation transformations by mild reaction conditions is a highly desirable research target for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. Following the straightforward methodology for directly transforming a wide scope of alcohols to alkyl bromides and chlorides using substoichiometric amounts of thioureas and N&#8208;halo succinimides (NXS) as a halogen source in a single step, we noticed that in apolar solvents bromination of chiral secondary alcohols did not produce the expected racemates. In this study, the stereochemical aspects of the bromination reaction were examined. Surprisingly, bromination of (&#177;)&#8208;threo&#8208; or (&#177;)&#8208;erythro&#8208;3&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;butanols revealed a single diastereomeric brominated product with retention of configuration. The scope of these reactions was expanded on several &#223;&#8208;aryl alcohols. During these studies, an unexpected stereospecific 1,2&#8208;migration of the phenyl group was shown to take place. The proposed mechanism of the 1,2&#8208;phenyl migration involves the formation of a spiro[2,5]octadienyl radical, which is then attacked by a bromide radical at any of the two cyclopropyl positions. Both 1,2&#8208;phenyl migration and bromination occur with double inversion of configuration, leading to products that retain the stereoisomeric configuration of the starting material.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversed Allylation of 3&#8208;Alkenyl Indoles Using Allyl Boronic Acids: Access to Tryptamine Based Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;carbon quaternary and tertiary stereocenters connected at the C2&#8208;position of functionalizable C3&#8208;alkylated indole nucleus are commonly occurring frameworks found in many indole alkaloids of medicinal importance. Their direct access is scarcely reported, a long&#8208;standing problem, and developing a unique yet simple method can pave the pathway to an entirely different retrosynthetic route for the total synthesis of these alkaloids. Herein, this problem is addressed by developing an unprecedented branch&#8208;selective allylation strategy employing a broad range of structurally and electronically different 3&#8208;alkenyl&#8208;indoles and allylboronic acids. The use of readily accessible starting precursors renders this method attractive for the total synthesis of indole alkaloids. The present strategy shows excellent functional group tolerance, atom economic, redox&#8208;neutral, scalable and easy to operate. The DFT calculation on the possible transition states indicated that allylboronic acid acts as a nucleophile rather than a more reactive boroxine. Mechanistically, this strategy is designed by exploiting the loss as well as regaining the indole&#8217;s aromaticity. The utility of this method is demonstrated in the total syntheses of seven prenylated tryptamine alkaloids and the first total syntheses of dimeric indole alkaloids, fluevirines E and mucronatin B.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Applications of Pillararene&#8208;Inspired Water&#8208;Soluble Hosts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pillararenes and their derivatives have emerged in supramolecular chemistry as unique macrocycles for applications in host&#8211;guest chemistry, materials science and biomimetics. Many variations have been conceived and synthesized in recent years and in this review, we relate progress in water&#8208;soluble versions: leaning towerarenes, extended&#8208;pillararenes, biphenarenes, helicarenes and octopusarenes. These are applied in targeted drug delivery, selective uptake and release of aromatic guests, fabrication of gold/silver and mesoporous silica nanoparticles, cell imaging, pollutant separation, biomedicine (e.g. biofilm disruptors, taste masking containers, neuromuscular blockers, antidote for macromolecular biotoxin) and enantioselective recognition. It is intended that this review will be helpful for research in synthetic macrocyclic chemistry and supramolecular functional systems, leading to practical applications in various research areas.</dc:description>

         <title>Optoelectronic Properties and Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Application of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Dyads Derived From 2,6&#8208;DicarboxyBODIPY</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Donor&#8208;acceptor BODIPY dyads, functionalized at the 2 and 6 positions with benzyl ester (BDP&#8208;DE) or carboxylic acid (BDP&#8208;DA) groups, were synthesized and characterized for their optoelectronic properties. The introduction of carbonyl groups increased the reduction potential of the BODIPY core by 0.15&#8208;0.4 eV compared to alkyl&#8208;substituted analogs. These dyads exhibited efficient intramolecular charge separation and triplet state formation through spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC), achieving singlet oxygen quantum yields of up to 92%, modulated by solvent polarity. The fluorescence and singlet oxygen generation of BDP&#8208;DAs depended on the ionization state of the carboxylic groups. Complexation of BDP&#8208;DAs with bovine serum albumin (BSA) significantly extended their excited state lifetimes, as shown by time&#8208;resolved fluorescence measurements. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) studies in human colorectal carcinoma (HCT116) cells and pig small intestinal organoids (enteroids) revealed subcellular localization patterns. Specifically, the diacid with a dimethoxyphenyl group (DA1) displayed longer lifetimes in lipid&#8208;droplet&#8208;like structures, while the diacid containing a meso&#8208;anthracenyl group (DA2) formed distinct 'islands' in cell monolayers, exhibiting a lifetime gradient. These results underscore the potential of donor&#8208;acceptor BODIPYs as fluorescent probes for distinguishing cellular environments.</dc:description>

         <title>The Doping of Al3+ at the Tetrahedral Site of Spinel Mn3O4 for Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spinel oxides have attracted much attention in electrocatalytic water oxidation. Specially, the Mn&#8208;based spinel structures merits fundamental investigation, as Mn is involved in water oxidation in natural photosynthesis.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spinel oxides have attracted much attention in electrocatalytic water oxidation. Specially, the Mn-based spinel structures merits fundamental investigation, as Mn is involved in water oxidation in natural photosynthesis.

         <title>pH&#8208; and Saccharide&#8208;Responsive&#160;Cyclometalated Iridium(III) Complexes with Boronic Acid Moieties Displaying a Wide Range of Phosphorescence Colors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single compounds displaying a wide range of luminescent colors are attractive optical materials for sensor applications. In this study, we present the beneficial combination of a cyclometalated iridium(III) complex scaffold and boronic acid units for designing stimuli&#8208;responsive luminescent materials with various emission colors. Five iridium(III) complexes bearing a diboronic acid ligand (bpyB2) were synthesized: Ir(C^N)bpyB2 (C^N = 2&#8208;phenylpyridine (1), 2&#8208;(2,4&#8208;difluorophenyl)pyridine (2), 2&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)pyridine (3), benzo[h]quinoline (4), 1&#8208;phenylisoquinoline (5)). The luminescence color of Complexes 1&#8211;4 changed in response to the solution pH or saccharide concentration. Complex 1 exhibited a color change from orange to green&#8208;blue due to structural alteration of the boronic acid moiety from trigonal to tetrahedral. Furthermore, the luminescence color of Complex 1 changed reversibly due to repetitive changes in the solution pH between 5 and 10, enabling tuning of the luminescence color and pH tracking. Furthermore, the color range was tuned by selecting an appropriate C^N ligand. Time&#8208;dependent density functional theory investigations revealed that the dramatic and reversible color changes could be ascribed to a switch in the electronic distribution in the lowest excited state from bpyB2 to C^N. The stimulus&#8208;responsive iridium(III) complexes provide a prospective scaffold for future applications in color&#8208;tunable optical devices and chemosensing systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering the Role of Crown&#8208;ether Receptor Orientation in C&#8208;H Oxidation Catalyzed by Supramolecular Nonheme FeIV(O) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The outstanding efficiency and selectivity of enzymatic reactions, such as C&#8208;H oxidation by nonheme iron oxygenases, stems from a precise control of substrate positioning inside the active site. The resulting proximity between a specific moiety (a certain C&#8208;H bond) to the reactant (a FeIV(O) active species) translates into higher rates and selectivity, that can be in part replicated also with artificial supramolecular catalysts. However, structural modification of the position and orientation of the binding site both in enzymes and in artificial catalysts often leads to significant variations in reactivity that can be difficult to rationalize due to the system's complexity. Herein, we quantitatively analyzed the impact of such a structural modification (namely receptor orientation) on the C&#8208;H oxidation reactivity (kinetics, Effective Molarity) and selectivity by comparing simple supramolecular FeIV(O) models. Overall, we did not observe significant differences in reaction rates, but we noticed slight changes in the selectivity profile. These results indicate that, when a crown&#8208;ether is employed as a recognition site, the key ingredient for enhanced reactivity is the presence of the supramolecular receptor itself rather than its exact orientation, providing a guide for the rational design of supramolecular catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile and Regioselective Deuteration of C2&#8208;Alkylated Imidazolium Salts in the Presence of Cesium Carbonate</title>

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are considered advanced class materials due to their exotic structural and optical properties. The abundance of starting monomers with variable linkage motifs may give rise to multiple conformations in either 2D or 3D fashion. Tailoring of the abovementioned properties has facilitated the application of COFs in a wide range of applications, which are strongly correlated with energy conversion schemes. Having a crystalline porous character and a large set of donor&#8208;acceptor combinations, COFs are expected to make huge impact in photocatalytic processes. In this Review, we present the recent advances in the development of semiconducting COF&#8208;based systems towards the photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide evolution. An overview is given about the effect of various parameters on the photocatalytic performance, such as charge transfer tuning, wettability by chemical functionalization, topology, porosity and crystallinity. Various challenges are discussed, and constructive insights are given for the development of highly functional COF&#8208;based photocatalysts for H2O2 evolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular Inhibition by Imidazole in Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrolysis of Protected Carbohydrates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The present study reveals an unexpected anomaly observed in the acid&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis of the 5,6&#8208;O&#8208;isopropylidene group in 3&#8208;O&#8208;protected D&#8208;gluco&#8208; and D&#8208;allofuranose derivatives. Although the removal of the 5,6&#8208;O&#8208;isopropylidene protecting group is typically rapid and quantitative under acidic conditions, an unexpected inhibition of this reaction is observed for the two C3&#8208;epimers, 3&#8208;O&#8208;imidazole sulfonyl moiety. X&#8208;ray data show a two&#8208;faced imidazole ring orientation in the crystal, while solution state NOE data reveal a critical interaction type between the isopropylidene and the imidazole rings. Advanced conformational searches coupled with ab initio molecular modeling illuminate and explain the NMR and kinetic data, and lay the groundwork for the most plausible mechanism of this unprecedented inhibition. These results provide valuable insights into the cross&#8208;coupling of carbohydrate O&#8208;protecting groups and shed light on how specific ring orientations and steric effects can trigger the inhibition of an otherwise easily feasible reaction, such as an acid&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Biotin Conjugated Fe(III)&#8208;Triscatecholate Complex as Tumour Targeting T1 MRI Contrast Agent via Second Sphere Water Relaxation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biotin&#8208;conjugated Fe(III)&#8208;complex is reported as a potential T1&#8208;MRI contrast agent (CA), which functions via second&#8208;sphere water relaxation. It shows a comparable formation constant to the known siderophore Fe(III) model complexes. The biotin group is attached as a carrier to improve the specificity of CA and to increase the &#8216;payload&#8217; in the tumour cells.







Abstract
The biotin&#8208;conjugated Fe(III) catecholate complex [Fe(BioL)3]3&#8722;, Fe(BioL)3 (BioLH2=N&#8208;(3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenethyl)&#8208;5&#8208;((3aS,4S,6aR)&#8208;2&#8208;oxohexahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;thieno[3,4&#8208;d]imidazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl)pentanamide) is reported as targeted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents (CAs) to increase the payload for early&#8208;stage imaging of tumours. The high spin state and octahedral coordination of the Fe(III) complex are confirmed by EPR spectra and DFT optimized structure, respectively. The overall formation constant (log K) of Fe(BioL)3 is determined as 45, which is higher than the known, more stable complex [Fe(EDTA)]. The complex Fe(BioL)3 exhibited r1 relaxivity of 3.09&#177;0.10 and 1.95&#177;0.09&#8197;mM&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C and 37&#8201;&#176;C, respectively, at 1.41&#8197;T and pH&#8197;7.35 via second&#8208;sphere water interactions as due to the absence of inner water coordination. The interaction of Fe(BioL)3 with bovine serum albumin (BSA) and human serum albumin (HSA) displayed enhanced relaxivity of 5.16&#177;0.15 and 10.0&#177;0.19&#8197;mM&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, respectively, at 25&#8201;&#176;C and pH&#8197;7.3 possibly via lengthening of rotational correlational time. The complex Fe(BioL)3 uptake studies with the avidin, a biotin&#8208;binding protein pocket, showed 46 and 37&#8201;% enhancements of r1 and r2 relaxivities. Complex Fe(BioL)3 showed 80&#8201;% cell viability of the human gastric adenocarcinoma (AGS) cells, and 89&#8201;% of iron has been uptaken into cells.

&lt;p&gt;The biotin-conjugated Fe(III)-complex is reported as a potential T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-MRI contrast agent (CA), which functions via second-sphere water relaxation. It shows a comparable formation constant to the known siderophore Fe(III) model complexes. The biotin group is attached as a carrier to improve the specificity of CA and to increase the &#8216;payload&#8217; in the tumour cells.

         <title>The Chemical Recovery of PMMA into Monomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we provide a review about the researches of chemical recovery of PMMA into monomer. Firstly, the pyrolysis of general PMMA at high temperature is illustrated by some typical research works. Subsequently, the depolymerization of end&#8208;functionalized PMMA under mild conditions is highlighted and discussed in detail, as this approach has emerged and achieved significant progresses in the past several years.







Abstract
Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), commonly known as plexiglass, is widely used in the areas of aircraft, automobile, construction and transplants, due to its high mechanical strength, good corrosion resistance, and excellent compatibility with human tissue. With the increase in production and usage of PMMA, the vast accumulation of PMMA waste has posed a challenge to the recycling of PMMA waste. However, at present, only less than 10&#8201;% of PMMA is recycled each year. The cost&#8208;effective chemical recovery of PMMA into monomer with high efficiency has attracted wide attention and has become one of the hot research subjects. The chemical recovery of PMMA into monomer are realized mainly via two approaches, including the pyrolysis of common PMMA at high temperature and the depolymerization of end&#8208;functionalized PMMA under mild conditions. The second approach has emerged and achieved significant progresses in the past several years. Herein, we provide a review about the researches of chemical recovery of PMMA into monomer.

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tune the Structural Components of Porous Frameworks for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic hydrogen production is an effective and sustainable method to address the depletion and pollution of fossil fuels. This review fine tunes the structural composition by constructing monomers, functional groups, and metal hybridization for photocatalytic hydrogen production. A detailed correlation analysis and summary were conducted on the structural characteristics of porous frameworks and their photocatalytic ability.







Abstract
With the depletion of fossil fuels and increasing pollution problems, green and sustainable energy supply attracts worldwide attention. Hydrogen is a green and high&#8208;density energy substance, and photocatalytic hydrogen generation is an effective and sustainable method. Therefore, developing high&#8208;performance photocatalysts plays a crucial role in practical application. Porous frameworks with large surface areas and diversified structures are considered promising candidates for photocatalysts. This review summarizes the recent progress on porous frameworks and their derivatives through fine&#8208;tuning structural components in terms of building monomers, functional groups, and metal hybridization for photocatalytic production of hydrogen. A detailed correlation is conducted between the structural features of porous frameworks and photocatalysis capability. In addition, we summarized the advantages of porous materials for photocatalytic hydrogen production and future development.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Incorporation of Fluorinated Prolines into Proteins and Their Impact on Neighbouring Residues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elena&#8208;Real et al. present a new approach for the site&#8208;specific incorporation of fluoroprolines in proteins. Using NMR, they show that the trans/cis ratio depends on the fluoroproline type and the sequence context, and that the spectroscopic perturbations on neighbouring atoms correlate with their distance to fluorine. These results validate this site&#8208;specific incorporation as an excellent strategy to monitor protein structure.







Abstract
The incorporation of fluorinated amino acids into proteins provides new opportunities to study biomolecular structure&#8208;function relationships in an elegant manner. The available strategies to incorporate the majority of fluorinated amino acids are not site&#8208;specific or imply important structural modifications. Here, we present a chemical biology approach for the site&#8208;specific incorporation of three commercially available C&#947;&#8208;modified fluoroprolines that has been validated using a non&#8208;pathogenic version of huntingtin exon&#8208;1 (HttExon&#8208;1). 19F, 1H and 15N NMR chemical shifts measured for multiple variants of HttExon&#8208;1 indicated that the trans/cis ratio was strongly dependent on the fluoroproline variant and the sequence context. By isotopically labelling the rest of the protein, we have shown that the extent of spectroscopic perturbations to the neighbouring residues depends on the number of fluorine atoms and the stereochemistry at C&#947;, as well as the isomeric form of the fluoroproline. We have rationalized these observations by means of extensive molecular dynamics simulations, indicating that the observed atomic chemical shift perturbations correlate with the distance to fluorine atoms and that the effect remains very local. These results validate the site&#8208;specific incorporation of fluoroprolines as an excellent strategy to monitor intra&#8208; and intermolecular interactions in disordered proline&#8208;rich proteins.

         <title>Luminescent Mechanochromism of a Platinum Complex with Four Monodentate Ligands Governed by Intramolecular Interactions Between Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luminescence mechanochromism of a platinum complex bearing four monodentate ligands is investigated. This platinum complex has two distinctly emissive polymorphs: a blue&#8208;emissive polymorph with low intensity and a brightly green&#8208;emissive polymorph. Upon mechanical stimulation, the blue&#8208;emitting phase is converted to green&#8208;emitting powder through a crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal phase transition. Structural analyses indicate that intramolecular interactions between ligands control the phase&#8208;transition behavior.

         <title>Structures, Chiroptical Properties, and Unexpectedly Facile Helical Inversion of Highly Elongated Anthracene&#8208;Fused Expanded Helicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coiling up fused anthracenes with more than two helical turns enabled us to resolve the enantiomers, which showed high CD and CPL activities. Even though the helical structures were considerably elongated, enantiomerization via helical inversion occurred more readily than that expected from a rigid molecular model.







Abstract
Helical fused anthracenes were elongated by fusing additional aromatic units at both ends to yield novel expanded helicenes. Compounds [5]HA2N and [7]HA consisting of 19 and 21 benzene rings, respectively, were synthesized by fourfold cycloisomerization of the corresponding terminal alkyne precursors. The helical structures were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, where the aromatic frameworks stacked effectively with the helical turn numbers exceeding two. The enantiomers of the two compounds were resolved by chiral HPLC. Whereas [5]HA2N readily underwent enantiomerization at room temperature at the barrier to enantiomerization of 91&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, the barrier was enhanced to 99&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for the long analog [7]HA. The enantiomers of [7]HA exhibited strong responses in the circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectra, as scaled by dissymmetry factors |gabs|=0.034 and |glum|=0.012. Theoretical calculations by the r2SCAN&#8208;3c method suggested stepwise mechanisms for the enantiomerization via helical inversion with acceptable barrier heights. The unexpectedly flexible nature of the aromatic frameworks of [5]HA2N and [7]HA was discussed on the basis of the proposed mechanism.

         <title>Reductive Aromatization of 5,7,12,14&#8208;Pentacenetetrone: Approach Towards Substituted Pentacenes?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
5,7,12,14&#8208;Pentacenetetrone was functionalized via reductive aromatization strategy. The products were characterized by UV/Vis, CV, XRD, and discussed in relation to DFT methods. This method tends to yield partially reduced or over&#8208;reduced pentacene derivatives.







Abstract
Herein we report a convenient access to asymmetrically substituted, well soluble pentacene derivatives synthesized from commercially available 5,7,12,14&#8208;pentacenetetrone via reductive one step functionalization. Zinc or potassium are used as reducing agents and the reduced intermediates are trapped with electrophiles such as acetyl, triisopropylsilyl or cationic methyl synthons. The reduction allows for an unsymmetric functionalization whilst one dione moiety is maintained due to partial reduction. The resulting dyes are characterized by UV/Vis and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Their redox potentials are studied by cyclic voltammetry. The experimentally determined molecular frontier orbital energies are rationalized by density functional theory. The spatial molecular packing motive in the solid state is studied as a function of the substituent size by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Attempts of reducing the second quinone moiety towards a functionalized pentacene led to an over&#8208;reduced 6,13&#8208;dihydropentacene derivative, which by means of an XRD structural analysis surprisingly displays a planar molecular conformation and unique optoelectronic properties.

         <title>Dehydrocoupling of Ammonia/Amine Boranes and Related Transformations Catalysed by Group 4 Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarises developments in the field of dehydrocoupling and dehydropolymerisation of amine boranes, as well as transfer hydrogenation using amine&#8208;boranes as reagents, catalysed by complexes of group 4 metals. We highlight reactivity trends and reaction mechanisms using representative examples and discuss potential further research directions in the field.







Abstract
Ammonia borane and amine boranes are main group analogues of alkanes, which are characterised by their large gravimetric hydrogen content. This hydrogen can be released in dehydrocoupling and dehydropolymerisation reactions to obtain B&#8722;N oligomers and polymers that are of importance as precursors for functional B&#8722;N materials. Furthermore, amine boranes are potent reagents for application in transfer hydrogenation reactions, representing a versatile, easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle alternative to the use of gaseous hydrogen for the reduction of organic compounds. Compared to late transition metals, complexes of readily available and comparatively inexpensive electropositive group 4 metals have been used to a much lesser extent. This review summarises the developments in the field of dehydrocoupling of amine boranes and transfer hydrogenation with these reagents, catalysed by complexes of group 4 metals. We analyse the background for these developments using examples and reaction mechanisms and provide an outlook for future developments in this field of research.

         <title>Directly Fused Porphyrin&#8208;Tetracyanopentacenequinone Conjugates: Role of the Cross&#8208;Conjugated, Powerful Electron Acceptor in Promoting Highly Efficient Charge Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast charge separation in new cross&#8208;conjugated donor&#8208;acceptor conjugates derived from tetracyanopentacene&#8208;quinone and porphyrin is reported. Facile reduction and fusion promoted charge transfer in the ground and excited states, while TD&#8208;DFT studies pinpointed the different excited states that promote charge transfer.







Abstract
Tetracyanopentacenequinone, a powerful electron acceptor, is fused directly to the porphyrin &#960;&#8208;system to create a new class of donor&#8208;acceptor conjugates. Owing to the direct fusion and electron&#8208;deficient property of tetracyanopentacenequinone, strong intramolecular charge transfer both in the ground and excited states was witnessed. As a control, porphyrin fused with pentacenequinone was also investigated. Upon complete spectral and electrochemical characterization, the excited state properties were initially probed by time&#8208;dependent DFT studies, and the occurrence of electron transfer from different excited states was established. Free&#8208;energy calculations revealed higher exothermic electron transfer (&gt;600&#8197;mV) than the control pentacenequinone&#8208;porphyrin systems. Pump&#8208;probe studies covering broad spatial and temporal regions revealed efficient excited state charge separation. This was unlike the control pentacenequinone&#8208;porphyrin system, where slow charge separation was witnessed only in the case of the zinc derivatives but not the free&#8208;base ones, followed by the populating of the triplet excited state. The lifetimes of the charge&#8208;separated states ranged between 30&#8211;500&#8197;ps depending on the solvent and metal ion in the porphyrin cavity. Nanosecond transient absorption studies established the charge recombination path to populate the triplet state of porphyrin or directly to the ground state as a function of solvent polarity and the nature of the conjugate. The significance of cross&#8208;conjugated tetracyanopentacenequinone fused directly to the porphyrin &#960; system in promoting highly exothermic and efficient charge separation, irrespective of its cross conjugation, is borne out from this study.

         <title>Unravelling the Relaxation Pathway and Excited State Dynamics of Ruthenium(II) Polypyridyl Complexes Incorporating Phosphorus&#8208;Based Monodentate Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, the photophysical, photochemical properties and photogenerated excited state dynamics of two new Ru(II) complexes, viz. [Ru(p&#8208;ttp)(bpy)(PTA)]2+ [1]2+, [Ru(p&#8208;ttp)(phen)(PTA)]2+ [2]2+ having a phosphorus&#8208;based ligand PTA [p&#8208;ttp = p&#8208;tolyl terpyridine; bpy = 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridyl; phen = 1,10&#8208;phenthroline and PTA = 1,3,5&#8208;triaza&#8208;7&#8208;phosphaadamantane] are reported. Upon excitation with 470 nm LED, [1]2+ and [2]2+ neither undergo ligand release nor exhibit room temperature luminescence/1O2 generation. However, when excited around their respective MLCT bands at 77 K, luminescence bands ~600 nm were observed. N&#8208;methylation of the coordinated PTA in complex [1]2+ resulted in [Ru(p&#8208;ttp)(bpy)(MePTA]3+ {[1&#8208;Me]3+} (MePTA = N&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triaza&#8208;7&#8208;phosphaadamantane). The difference in photophysical and electrochemical properties of [1]2+ and [1&#8208;Me]3+ was rationalized by DFT calculations. Transient absorption spectroscopic analysis to unravel the relaxation pathway of&#160;complexes suggested the involvement of the 3MC state in the relaxation process. The effect of electronic modulation resulted from the N&#8208;methylation of PTA on the excited state dynamics of the complexes was observed. MTT assays in various cancer cells revealed their non&#8208;cytotoxic nature in the dark or upon irradiation with 470 nm blue LED. The non&#8208;toxicity of the complexes, despite being internalized in cancer cells as established by ICP&#8208;MS, is attributed to their dark and photostability and the inability to generate 1O2.</dc:description>

The non-toxicity of the complexes, despite being internalized in cancer cells as established by ICP-MS, is attributed to their dark and photostability and the inability to generate 1O2.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anodic Activation of Prussian Blue Analog Leads to Highly Active Cobalt&#8208;doped Nickel (Oxy)hydroxide for Organic Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water&#8208;assisted electrocatalytic oxidation of alcohols into valuable chemicals is a promising strategy to circumvent the sluggish kinetics of water oxidation, while also reducing cell voltage and improving energy efficiency. Recently, transition metal (TM)&#8208;based catalysts have been investigated for anodic alcohol oxidation, but success has been limited due to competition from the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) within the working regime. In this study, NiCo&#8208;based Prussian blue analog (PBA) was electrochemically activated at the anodic potential to produce a Co&#8208;Ni(O)OH active catalyst with a nanosheet&#8208;like architecture. This catalyst was further employed for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol (PhCH2OH) to benzoic acid (PhCOOH), achieving a 97% Faradaic efficiency (FE). The electrochemical activity of Co&#8208;Ni(O)OH was also compared with hydrothermally prepared CoNi&#8208;LDH, demonstrating that the PBA&#8208;derived Co&#8208;Ni(O)OH was more effective.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8208;Type Cyclobisbiphenylenecarbonyls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The scalable synthesis of figure&#8208;eight &#960;&#8208;systems is challenging for the conventional bottom&#8208;up approach. We have recently reported that the oxidative inner&#8208;bond cleavage of commercially available dibenzo[g,p]chrysene efficiently furnishes a figure&#8208;eight &#960;&#8208;acceptor, cyclobisbiphenylenecarbonyl (CBBC), in large quantity. Furthermore, its donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type derivative with four N&#8208;carbazolyl substituents at the meta&#8208;positions of the carbonyl groups exhibited thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with a high |gCPL| value of 1.0 &#215; 10&#8211;2. Herein, we synthesized nine donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type CBBC derivatives by changing the donor substituents and their positions. Compared to previously reported carbazole&#8208;substituted CBBC, tetramethylcarbazole&#8208; and 9,10&#8208;dihydro&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethylacridine&#8208;substituted derivatives exhibited enhanced emission quantum yields and accelerated reverse intersystem crossing. The functionalization of the para&#8208;positions of the carbonyl groups resulted in better tunability of emission colors rather than meta&#8208;functionalization, whose color variation ranges from light blue to red. The incorporation of bulky substituents at the meta&#8208;positions of the carbonyl groups induced the conformational change to a distorted ring structure. Investigation of the substituent effect on the chiroptical properties revealed that the introduction of less bulky donor units such as carbazole at the meta&#8208;positions of the carbonyl groups is effective in achieving high |gCPL| values.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantum&#8208;Classical Simulations Reveal the Photoisomerization Mechanism of a Prototypical First&#8208;Generation Molecular Motor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We show that in a prototypical alkene&#8208;based first&#8208;generation molecular motor efficient forward photoisomerization is achieved through a slow picosecond&#8208;timescale excited&#8208;state decay, which only takes place from a largely twisted dark minimum, far from any conical&#8208;intersection point. After relaxation to the ground state, it is the topography of the potential energy surface, controlled by the conformation of the central cyclopentene rings, which mainly determines the high yields of forward photoisomerization in our investigated motor.







Abstract
Light&#8208;driven molecular rotary motors convert the energy of absorbed light into unidirectional rotational motion and are key components in the design of molecular machines. The archetypal class of light&#8208;driven rotary motors is chiral overcrowded alkenes, where the rotational movement is achieved through consecutive cis&#8208;trans photoisomerization reactions and thermal helix inversion steps. While the thermal steps have been rather well understood by now, our understanding of the photoisomerization reactions of overcrowded alkene&#8208;based motors still misses key points that would explain the striking differences in operation efficiency of the known systems. Here, we employ quantum&#8208;chemical calculations and nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the excited&#8208;state decay and photoisomerization mechanism in a prototypical alkene&#8208;based first&#8208;generation rotary motor. We show that the initially excited bright state undergoes an ultrafast relaxation to multiple excited&#8208;state minima separated by low energy barriers and reveal a slow picosecond&#8208;timescale decay to the ground state, which only occurs from a largely twisted dark excited&#8208;state minimum, far from any conical&#8208;intersection point. Additionally, we attribute the origin of the high yields of forward photoisomerization in our investigated motor to the favorable topography of the ground&#8208;state potential energy surface, which is controlled by the conformation of the central cyclopentene rings.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, a supramolecular fluorescent material was constructed by using double&#8208;cavity twisted cucurbit[14]uril (tQ[14]) and positively charged Astrazon Pink FG (APFG) based on the non&#8208;covalent host&#8208;guest interaction for the first time. The thermodynamic parameters of the APFG@tQ[14] in aqueous solution were determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), the results indicated that the spontaneous assembly of APFG@tQ[14] is mainly driven by enthalpy. The intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect induced the APFG@tQ[14] probe to emit a strong orange&#8208;red fluorescence. Due to its good optical properties and low toxicity, APFG@tQ[14] was successfully applied to multi&#8208;channel imaging of HK2 cells. This demonstrates the great potential of APFG@tQ[14] in labeling and tracking living cells.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Investigating the correlation between metal coordination and molecular conductivity in single&#8208;molecule systems is essential for advancing our knowledge of molecular electronics, particularly in the realm of spintronics. In the present study, we developed two complex wires utilizing the bipyridine ligand and two transition metal ions, Co2+ and Zn2+, aiming to study the impact of different spin characters on single&#8208;molecule charge transport properties. Single&#8208;molecule conductance was investigated using scanning tunnelling microscope breaking junctions (STM&#8208;BJ) technique and the underlying mechanism was analysed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We demonstrated that the conductance predominantly increases after inserting Zn2+, indicating a conducting channel has been constructed. In contrast, the conductance of the analogue coordinated with Co2+ does not change significantly, this can be explained by distinct disparities between spin&#8208;up and spin&#8208;down channels, in which destructive quantum interference in spin&#8208;down state counteracts the enhancement of molecular conductance. Our study establishes the groundwork for a systematic approach to the design, fabrication, and implementation of single&#8208;complex conductance explorations.</dc:description>

         <title>Convergent Total Synthesis of Ixabepilone and Its Analogues Enabled by Highly Efficient Asymmetric Hydrogenations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The convergent total synthesis of ixabepilone and its analogues in a 13&#8208;step longest linear sequence is reported. The crucial chiral centers at challenging C3&#8208;O, C8&#8208;C and C15&#8208;N positions on the scaffold of the ixabepilone were installed via highly efficient asymmetric hydrogenations (up to 95% yield and up to 99% e.e.) and all three fragments could be prepared on gram scale. The key aldol reaction bridges the aldehyde and keto fragments with high yield and exquisite diastereo control (8:1 d.r.). Finally, a novel RCM reaction conformationally controlled by a bulky silyl group was reported, which allows the facile synthesis of ixabepilone and its analogues.</dc:description>

         <title>A Prebiotic Route to Lactate from Acetaldehyde, Cyanide and Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) has fluctuated throughout Earth's history. However, the role of CO2 in prebiotic chemistry has predominantly been limitedly postulated as a C1 precursor, which can be reduced to carbon monoxide or methane mimicking the Wood&#8208;Ljungdahl pathway. Herein we present neglected roles of CO2 as an active promoter in accessing biologically important C3&#8208;builidng blocks such as lactate, via redox&#8208;economic reaction cycles from cyanide (C1) and acetaldehyde (C2). We verified that Lewis acidic CO2 facilitates the formation of cyanohydrin of acetaldehyde under ambient conditions. Furthermore, selective protection of cyanohydrin to carbonates by atmospheric CO2 led to anchimeric assisted hydrolysis of the nitrile group to generate lactate. This work supports both warm pond and hydrothermal vent hypotheses, postulating that a CO2&#8208;rich primordial atmosphere and the acidic aqueous solution could have fostered the emergence of biologically relevant molecules and life itself.</dc:description>

         <title>Zinc Sensing with Pyridine&#8208;Based Lanthanide Contrast Agent: Structural Analysis in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc is an important physiological cation, and its misregulation is implicated in various diseases. It is therefore important to be able to image zinc by non&#8208;invasive methods such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). In this work, we have successfully synthesized a novel Gd3+&#8208;based complex specifically for Zn2+ sensing by MRI. Using a combination of NMR, luminescence, potentiometric, and relaxivity experiments, completed with DFT calculations, we demonstrate that incorporating a short linker between the Zn2+ sensing unit and the Gd3+ complex leads to unique behavior of the system in the absence of Zn2+. A significant increase in efficacy of the system is observed upon Zn2+ binding, and importantly, the complex is highly selective for Zn2+ relative to other physiological cations. A comprehensive structural study reliably determines the microscopic parameters at the origin of the Zn2+ response, primarily an increase in the number of water molecules directly coordinated to Gd3+ upon Zn2+ binding. Crucially, the system maintains a strong response to Zn2+ binding in the presence of Human Serum Albumin, highlighting its potential for biological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Progress in Atomically Precise Cu&#8208;M Alloy Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal nanoclusters (NCs) with dimensions of approximately 3 nm serve as a crucial link between metal&#8208;organic complexes and metal nanoparticles, garnering significant interest due to their distinctive molecule&#8208;like characteristics. These include well&#8208;defined molecular structures, clear HOMO&#8211;LUMO transitions, quantized charge, and robust luminescence emission. Atomically precise alloy NCs, in contrast to homometallic NCs, exhibit a wealth of structures and intriguing properties, with their novel attributes often intricately tied to the positions of alloyed elements within the structure, facilitating the exploration of structure&#8208;property relationships. A notable subgroup within this category comprises Cu&#8211;M (where M represents metals such as Au, Ag, Rh, Ir, Pd, Pt, Zn, Al etc.) alloy NCs. In this review, we initially outline recent advancements in the development of efficient synthetic techniques for Cu&#8208;M alloy NCs, emphasizing the underlying physical and chemical properties that enable precise control over their sizes and surface characteristics. Subsequently, we delve into recent progress in structural elucidation techniques for Cu&#8208;M alloy NCs. This structural insight is instrumental in comprehensively understanding the structure&#8208;property correlations at the molecular level. Finally, we showcase various examples of Cu&#8208;M alloy NCs to illustrate their photoluminescent and catalytic properties, shedding light on their diverse functionalities and potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Buffering Mechanism Enhances Stability and Water Oxidation Efficiency of CeO2@NiFe&#8208;LDH</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nickel&#8208;iron layered double hydroxide shows significant promise as an electrocatalyst in facilitating oxygen evolution reactions. But its development is hindered by low conductivity and insufficient cycling stability. Herein, the synthesis of a hierarchically structured heterostructure catalyst, CeO2@NiFe LDH, is reported through a straightforward two&#8208;step process involving hydrothermal treatment. The catalyst realizes a significant breakthrough in OER catalytic performance and stability. At a current density of 100 mA cm&#8208;2, the overpotentials amount to 255 mV in 1 M KOH, 263 mV in simulated seawater with alkaline conditions, and 346 mV in actual alkaline seawater. After 200 hours of continuous operation under high current density in simulated alkaline seawater, the morphology with no significant alterations observed, highlighting its high stability in complex seawater environments. Introducing CeO2 optimizes the binding energy of the OH intermediate, which facilitates the formation and dissociation of the OOH intermediate. In situ Raman analysis demonstrates the positive impact of CeO2 on the generation of active species. This research emphasizes the efficacy of CeO2 in improving the performance and durability of NiFe LDH for oxygen evolution reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>De Novo Design of Lipopeptide&#8208;Based &#946;&#8208;Sheet&#8208;Like Self&#8208;Assemblies: A Strategy to Develop Fusion Inhibitors as Broad&#8208;Spectrum Antivirals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recent surge in emerging viral infections warrants the design of broad&#8208;spectrum antivirals. We aim to develop a lead molecule that targets a common biochemical feature of many enveloped viruses, membrane fusion. To achieve the broad&#8208;spectrum ability, instead of targeting the fusion machinery, we plan to modulate the physicochemical properties of the host and viral membranes to block fusion. The approach is based on the Coronin&#8208;1 protein of Mycobacterium, which presumably inhibits the phagosome&#8208;lysosome fusion, and a unique Trp&#8208;Asp (WD) sequence is placed at the distorted &#946;&#8208;meander motif. We designed a WD&#8208;based branched lipopeptide (Myr&#8208;D(WD)2) that supported the intermolecular interactions to create a &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;like supramolecular assembly at the membrane surface. TEM and confocal fluorescence experiments also suggest that the lipopeptide self&#8208;assembled at the bilayer interface and modulated the interfacial order and the water penetration. We demonstrated that the supramolecular organization of Myr&#8208;D(WD)2 could block artificial membrane fusion completely and restrict pH&#8208;dependent H1N1, H9N2, and pH&#8208;independent mouse hepatitis virus, human coronavirus (HCoV&#8208;OC43) infections. The present study provided an evidence&#8208;based broad&#8208;spectrum antiviral potential of a designed self&#8208;assembled lipopeptide.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemiluminescence immunoassay of cTnI with ruthenium&#8208;based metal covalent organic framework and dual DNAzymes cascade amplification strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Currently, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with tunability and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high stability are promising nanomaterials for electrochemiluminescence (ECL), while Ru&#8208;based metal covalent organic frameworks (Ru&#8208;MCOFs) have rarely been reported. Herein, an ECL immunosensor based on a strong ECL&#8208;emitting Ru&#8208;MCOF was proposed for the sensitive detection of the cardiac troponin&#8208;I (cTnI). Imine&#8208;linked Ru&#8208;MCOF was prepared as an ECL emitter via solvothermal method using tris(4,4' &#8208;diamino&#8208;2,2' &#8208;bipyridine)ruthenium(II) (Ru(dbpy)32+) as a precursor. Compared with monomers, the imine&#8208;linked Ru&#8208;MCOF achieved structural extension through covalent bonds, which not only effectively facilitated the electrochemical activation of the luminophores but also shortened the transmission distance between electrons and co&#8208;reactants, generating dense ECL emission. In addition, the porous framework of Ru&#8208;MCOF provided a microreactor with nanoconfinement effect, which could accelerate the diffusion of co&#8208;reactants into the framework and promote the excitation of internal and external ECL emitters, significantly enhancing the ECL intensity. Considering the excellent ECL performance of Ru&#8208;MCOF, combined with dual DNAzymes&#8208;driven catalytic hairpin cycle amplification, the ECL immunosensor achieved sensitive detection of cTnI with a detection limit as low as 0.42 fg/mL. The proposed highly stable Ru&#8208;MCOF raises a new approach for exploring MCOF&#8208;based luminophores, highlighting the potential of MCOFs in advancing ECL emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Adaptive Molecular Crystals Activated by [2+2] and [4+4] Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photomechanical crystals act as light&#8208;driven material&#8208;machines that can convert the energy carried by photons into kinetic energy via shape deformation or displacement, and this capability holds a paramount significance for the development of photoactuated devices. This transformation is usually attributed to anisotropic expansion or contraction of the unit cell engendered by light&#8208;induced structural modifications that lead to accumulation and release of stress that generates a momentum, resulting in readily observable mechanical effects. Among the available photochemical processes, the photoinduced [2+2] and [4+4] are known for their robustness, predictability, amenability for control with molecular and supramolecular engineering approaches, and efficiency that has already been elevated to a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept smart devices based on organic crystals. This article presents a summary of the recent research progress on photomechanical properties of organic and metal&#8208;organic crystals where the mechanical effects are based on [2+2] and [4+4] cycloaddition reactions. It consolidates the current understating of the chemical strategies and structure&#8211;property correlations, and highlights the advantages and drawbacks of this class of adaptive crystals within the broader field of crystal adaptronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Sheets Copper&#8208;Cobalt Graphitic Carbon Nitride Dual Single&#8208;Atom&#160;Catalysts for the Epoxidation of Styrene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dual&#160;single&#8208;atom catalysts have attracted considerable research interest due to their higher metal atom loading and more flexible active sites compared to single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs).&#160;We pioneered the one&#8208;step synthesis of sheets copper&#8208;cobalt graphitic carbon nitride dual single&#8208;atom (S&#8208;Cu/Co&#8208;g&#8208;C3N4) using folding fan&#8208;shaped aluminum foil as a template, and used them as catalysts in the epoxidation of styrene respectively. Through XAFS&#65288;X&#8208;ray Absorption Fine Structure&#65289; and&#160;other characterizations, it is found that Cu and Co&#160;single atoms are stabilized separately on g&#8208;C3N4&#160;via coordination with nitrogen (N), hindered the ordered growth of sheets, and formed more pore structures, which not only increased more catalytically active sites, but also effectively prevented the flakes re&#8208;aggregate during the catalytic process. And the synergistic effect between Cu and Co changes the energy band structure of the material and facilitates electron transfer during catalysis, hence an excellent catalytic effect of 89% styrene conversion and 85% styrene oxide selectivity was achieved when S&#8208;Cu/Co&#8208;g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;1:1 was applied in the epoxidation of styrene. Furthermore, the mechanisms&#160;of the epoxidation of styrene with S&#8208;Cu/Co&#8208;g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;1:1&#160;was&#160;probed by the density functional theory (DFT) based on the&#160;slab model.</dc:description>

         <title>PDA/PMMA blend membrane utilized for the selective adsorption and separation of heavy metal ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The detrimental effects of heavy metal aqueous pollution are attracting people's attention increasingly. Membrane separation technology plays a pivotal role in the treatment of aqueous pollution due to its low energy consumption and excellent separation effect. Inspired by the strong adhesion of heavy metal ions by the dopamine in mussel protein, we have fabricated the 5%, 10%, 20% and 30% proportion of polydopamine (PDA)/Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) blend membranes with dopamine structure by solvent&#8208;induced phase conversion. I&#8208;V current, UV titration and transmission tests examined the membrane's selective adsorption and retention capabilities for Fe3+, Cu2+ and Cr3+. These experiments indicated the different selectivity for Fe3+ of four blend membranes with varying PDA/PMMA fractions. Based on Langmuir's adsorption theory, the 10% blend membranes exhibited the most outstanding selective adsorption for Fe3+ with an LOD of 4.724&#215;10&#8208;9 M. Moreover, the ability to retain Fe3+ is still close to 100% after 48 h of transmission. This study manifested that the PDA/PMMA blend membrane is capable of adsorbing trace amounts of Fe3+ from water, thereby contributing to aqueous purification.</dc:description>
