         <title>Foldable Detergents for Membrane Protein Study: Importance of Detergent Core Flexibility in Protein Stabilization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 21, April 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tandem triazine&#8208;based maltoside with the ethylene diamine linker (i.&#8201;e., TZM&#8722;E9) conferred markedly enhanced stability to the tested membrane proteins compared to the hydrazine linker analog and the conventional dodecyl maltoside (DDM): prokaryotic leucine transporter (LeuT), human &#946;2 adrenergic receptor (&#946;2AR), and mouse &#956;&#8208;opioid receptor (MOR). The favorable behaviors of this detergent for membrane protein stability are mainly due to its foldable nature, originating from the flexible ethylene diamine linker present between the two triazine units.







Abstract
Membrane proteins are of biological and pharmaceutical significance. However, their structural study is extremely challenging mainly due to the fact that only a small number of chemical tools are suitable for stabilizing membrane proteins in solution. Detergents are widely used in membrane protein study, but conventional detergents are generally poor at stabilizing challenging membrane proteins such as G protein&#8208;coupled receptors and protein complexes. In the current study, we prepared tandem triazine&#8208;based maltosides (TZMs) with two amphiphilic triazine units connected by different diamine linkers, hydrazine (TZM&#8722;Hs) and 1,2&#8208;ethylenediamine (TZM&#8722;Es). These TZMs were consistently superior to a gold standard detergent (DDM) in terms of stabilizing a few membrane proteins. In addition, the TZM&#8722;Es containing a long linker showed more general protein stabilization efficacy with multiple membrane proteins than the TZM&#8722;Hs containing a short linker. This result indicates that introduction of the flexible1,2&#8208;ethylenediamine linker between two rigid triazine rings enables the TZM&#8722;Es to fold into favourable conformations in order to promote membrane protein stability. The novel concept of detergent foldability introduced in the current study has potential in rational detergent design and membrane protein applications.

         <title>Structure Engineering of BiSbSx Nanocrystals Embedded within Sulfurized Polyacrylonitrile Fibers for High Performance of Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 21, April 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The BiSbSx@sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (BiSbSx@SPAN) composite is fabricated through electrospinning followed by sulfuration treatment. When employed as an anode of PIBs, it maintains a large reversible capacity of 790&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 50&#8197;cycles at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and superior rate performance (472&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 2000&#8197;cycles). It's one of the best performances for metal dichalcogenides anodes for PIBs to date.







Abstract
Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are regarded as promising candidates in next&#8208;generation energy storage technology; however, the electrode materials in PIBs are usually restricted by the shortcomings of large volume expansion and poor cycling stability stemming from a high resistance towards diffusion and insertion of large&#8208;sized K ions. In this study, BiSbSx nanocrystals are rationally integrated with sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) fibres through electrospinning technology with an annealing process. Such a unique structure, in which BiSbSx nanocrystals are embedded inside the SPAN fibre, affords multiple binding sites and a short diffusion length for K+ to realize fast kinetics. In addition, the molecular structure of SPAN features robust chemical interactions for stationary diffluent discharge products. Thus, the electrode demonstrates a superior potassium storage performance with an excellent reversible capacity of 790&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 50&#8197;cycles) and 472&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 2000&#8197;cycles). It's one of the best performances for metal dichalcogenides anodes for PIBs to date. The unusual performance of the BiSbSx@SPAN composite is attributed to the synergistic effects of the judicious nanostructure engineering of BiSbSx nanocrystals as well as the chemical interaction and confinement of SPAN fibers.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative C&#8722;O and C&#8722;N Coupling Reactions Using Air as Sole Oxidant**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 21, April 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron&#8208;catalyzed oxidative carbon&#8722;heteroatom bond formations using air as sole oxidant provide a variety of oxygenated and aminated arylamines as well as aminated phenols. The appropriate additive (Br&#248;nsted acid, Lewis acid, or base) is crucial for these couplings. The mild oxidative reaction proceeds at room temperature and represents a powerful alternative to traditional carbon&#8722;heteroatom couplings.







Abstract
We describe the oxygenation of tertiary arylamines, and the amination of tertiary arylamines and phenols. The key step of these coupling reactions is an iron&#8208;catalyzed oxidative C&#8722;O or C&#8722;N bond formation which generally provides the corresponding products in high yields and with excellent regioselectivity. The transformations are accomplished using hexadecafluorophthalocyanine&#8722;iron(II) (FePcF16) as catalyst in the presence of an acid or a base additive and require only ambient air as sole oxidant.

Abstract
A versatile asymmetric synthesis of bicyclic pyrazolidinones through alkaloid&#8208;catalyzed formal [3+2]&#8208; and [3+2+2]&#8208;cycloadditions of ketenes with azomethine imines is described. The methodology was found to be tolerant of ketene and a variety of monosubstituted ketenes (R=alkyl, OAc). The products were formed in good to excellent yields (71&#8211;99&#8201;% for 24 examples, 39 examples in all), with good to excellent diastereoselectivity in many cases (dr 3&#8201;:&#8201;1 to 27&#8201;:&#8201;1 for 22 examples), and with excellent enantioselectivity for most examples (&#8805;93&#8201;% ee for 34 products). In the case of most disubstituted ketenes, the reaction proceeded through a [3+2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition to form structurally interesting bicyclic pyrazolo&#8208;oxadiazepinediones with moderate diastereoselectivity (dr up to 3.7&#8201;:&#8201;1) and as racemic mixtures (3 examples). The method represents the first unambiguous example of an enantioselective reaction between ketenes and a 1,3&#8208;dipole.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A versatile asymmetric synthesis of bicyclic pyrazolidinones through alkaloid-catalyzed formal [3+2]- and [3+2+2]-cycloadditions of ketenes with azomethine imines is described. The methodology was found to be tolerant of ketene and a variety of monosubstituted ketenes (R=alkyl, OAc). The products were formed in good to excellent yields (71&#8211;99&#8201;% for 24 examples, 39 examples in all), with good to excellent diastereoselectivity in many cases (dr 3&#8201;:&#8201;1 to 27&#8201;:&#8201;1 for 22 examples), and with excellent enantioselectivity for most examples (&#8805;93&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt; for 34 products). In the case of most disubstituted ketenes, the reaction proceeded through a [3+2+2]-cycloaddition to form structurally interesting bicyclic pyrazolo-oxadiazepinediones with moderate diastereoselectivity (dr up to 3.7&#8201;:&#8201;1) and as racemic mixtures (3 examples). The method represents the first unambiguous example of an enantioselective reaction between ketenes and a 1,3-dipole.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Insights into the Electronic Structure of a U(IV) Amido and U(V) Imido Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 21, April 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the compound [U(V)(TMSI)Cl5], uranium could be stabilized in the rare +V oxidation state proven by HERFD XANES measurements. In the complex, an inverse trans influence (ITI) was uncovered. Quantum chemical calculations show this effect to be dependent on the electronic situation on the metal centre, thus increasing with higher oxidation state.







Abstract
Reaction of the N&#8208;heterocylic carbene ligand iPrIm (L1) and lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (TMSA) as a base with UCl4 resulted in U(IV) and U(V) complexes. Uranium's +V oxidation state in (HL1)2[U(V)(TMSI)Cl5] (TMSI=trimethylsilylimido) (2) was confirmed by HERFD&#8208;XANES measurements. Solid state characterization by SC&#8208;XRD and geometry optimisation of [U(IV)(L1)2(TMSA)Cl3] (1) indicated a silylamido ligand mediated inverse trans influence (ITI). The ITI was examined regarding different metal oxidation states and was compared to transition metal analogues by theoretical calculations.

Molecular fishing: Quantum chemical calculations show the potential of several carbene&#8208;stabilized borylenes in capturing dinitrogen either as a borylene mono&#8208;adduct or as a bridging entity by two borylene moieties







Abstract
Computational investigations were carried out to probe the potential of several dicoordinate, singly base&#8208;stabilized borylenes of the form [L&#8594;BR] (L=neutral Lewis base) in dinitrogen binding. The calculated reaction free energies and activation barriers associated with the formation of mono&#8208; and diborylene&#8208;N2 adducts suggest the presence of thermally surmountable kinetic barriers towards their possible isolation. Our results show that the exergonicity of dinitrogen activation and fixation is linearly dependent on the natural charge at the boron center, which can be tuned to design novel boron&#8208;based compounds with potential applications to small&#8208;molecule activation. EDA&#8208;NOCV analysis reveals strong binding of dinitrogen to these base&#8208;stabilized borylenes.

         <title>Expanded Mercaptocalixarenes: A New Kind of Macrocyclic Ligands for Stabilization of Polynuclear Thiolate Clusters</title>

The synthesis of expanded mercaptocalix[4]arenes, in which four 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;thiophenolato units are joined by &#8722;CH2NRCH2&#8722; and &#8722;CH2NR(CH2)3NRCH2&#8722; linkers, has been achieved. The new macrocycles do not show the conformational isomerism typical of the parent mercaptocalix[4]arenes. The potential of these macrocycles to form mixed&#8208;ligand complexes with first row&#8208;transition metal ions is demonstrated.







Abstract
The syntheses and properties of expanded 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;mercaptocalix[4]arenes, in which the methylene linkers are replaced by &#8722;CH2NRCH2&#8722; or &#8722;CH2NRCH2&#8722; and &#8722;CH2NRCH2CH2CH2NRCH2&#8722; units, are described. The new macrocycles were obtained in a step&#8208;wise manner, utilizing fully protected, i.&#8201;e. S&#8208;alkylated, derivatives of the oxidation&#8208;sensitive thiophenols in the cyclisation steps. Reductive cleavage of the macrobicyclic or macrotricyclic intermediates (6, 7, 11) afforded the free thiophenols (H48, H49, and H412) in preparative yields as their hydrochloride salts. The protected proligands can exist in two conformations, resembling the &#8220;cone&#8221; and &#8220;1,3&#8208;alternate&#8221; conformations found for the parent calix[4]arenes. The free macrocycles do not show conformational isomerism, but are readily oxidized forming intramolecular disulfide linkages. Preliminary complexation experiments show that these expanded mercaptocalixarenes can serve as supporting ligands for tetranuclear thiolato clusters.

         <title>Unfolding the Role of Building Units of MOFs with Mechanistic Insight Towards Selective Metal Ions Detection in Water**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 21, April 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective ferric ions detection has been carried out with systematic screening by varying number of Lewis basic (pyridyl&#8208;N atoms) sites in a series of isostructural, robust UiO&#8208;67 MOFs. Among them, al the three fluorescent MOFs are seen to present quenching response towards Fe3+ ions in water. However, UiO&#8208;67@N exhibits highly selective and sensitive response, whereas emission of both UiO&#8208;67 and UiO&#8208;67@NN is quenched by several metal ions.







Abstract
The potential emergence of fluorescence&#8208;based techniques has propelled research towards developing probes that can sense trace metal ions specifically. Although luminescent metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are well suited for this application, the role of building blocks towards detection is not fully understood. In this work, a systematic screening by varying number of Lewis basic (pyridyl&#8208;N atoms) sites is carried out in a series of isostructural, robust UiO&#8208;67 MOFs, and targeting a model metal ion&#8208;Fe3+. All the three fluorescent MOFs are seen to present quenching response towards Fe3+ ions in water. However, UiO&#8208;67@N exhibits highly selective and sensitive response, whereas emission of both UiO&#8208;67 and UiO&#8208;67@NN is quenched by several metal ions. Detailed experimental and theoretical mechanistic investigation is carried out in addition to demonstration of UiO&#8208;67@N being able to sense trace amount of Fe3+ ions in synthetic biological water sample. Further, UiO&#8208;67@N based mixed&#8208;matrix membrane (MMM) has been prepared and employed to mimic the real time Fe3+ ions detection in water.

Detailed experimental and theoretical mechanistic investigation is carried out in addition to demonstration of UiO-67@N being able to sense trace amount of Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions in synthetic biological water sample. Further, UiO-67@N based mixed-matrix membrane (MMM) has been prepared and employed to mimic the real time Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions detection in water.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Cycloaromatization Route to Cycloparaphenylenes that Exhibit Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 21, April 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a high&#8208;yielding new route to substituted cycloparaphenylenes via the cationic rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition of cyclophenylene&#8208;ethynylenes with monoynes. The thus obtained products, substituted [8]cycloparaphenylene&#8208;triphenylenes, exhibited definite aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), and are noteworthy as a novel AIE&#8208;active cycloarylene that does not have ordinally AIE luminogens, such as tetraphenyl&#8208;ethene and benzene skeletons.







Abstract
A high&#8208;yielding new route to substituted cycloparaphenylenes has been developed via reductive aromatization of a diyne bearing two cyclohexadiene units giving a cyclophenylene&#8208;ethynylene (CPE) followed by the cationic rhodium(I)/dppe complex&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition (cycloaromatization) of the CPE with monoynes. The thus&#8208;obtained products, substituted [8]cycloparaphenylene&#8208;triphenylenes ([8]CPPTs), exhibited definite aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE). This molecule is noteworthy as a novel AIE&#8208;active cycloarylene that does not have well&#8208;known AIE luminogens, such as tetraphenylethene and 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetraphenylbenzene skeletons. The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses of the AIE&#8208;active [8]CPPTs revealed their highly ordered packing structures in which the rotation of the triphenylene moieties is restricted.

A Cu(I)/chiral bisoxazoline&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Doyle&#8208;Kirmse reaction of polyfluoroaryl allenyl sulfides with &#945;&#8208;diazoesters, generating chiral tertiary homopropargylic sulfides in good enantioselectivities under mild conditions.







Abstract
Herein, a Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Doyle&#8208;Kirmse reaction of allenyl sulfides and &#945;&#8208;diazoesters is reported, which provides an efficient synthetic route to enantio&#8208;enriched chiral tertiary homopropargylic sulfides. This reaction features high enantioselectivities (up to 96&#8201;%&#8201;ee) and good functional group tolerance. The alkyl substituted &#945;&#8208;diazoester has also been demonstrated as the efficient substrates in the asymmetric Doyle&#8208;Kirmse reaction. Mechanistic studies, including kinetic experiments, were conducted to gain insights into the details of the reaction pathway. The potential synthetic utility of this protocol has also been demonstrated.

         <title>Oxidation of BINOLs by Hypervalent Iodine Reagents: Facile Synthesis of Xanthenes and Lactones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 21, April 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidation of BINOLs promoted by hypervalent iodine reagents is leading to binaphthyl&#8208;based xanthenes and to nine&#8208;membered lactones in high yields. In the presence of alcohols this method provides a new strategy for the synthesis of alkoxylated xanthene derivatives.







Abstract
Xanthene derivatives have broad applications in medicines, fluorescent probes, dyes, food additives, etc. Therefore, much attention was focused on developing the synthetic methods to prepare these compounds. Binaphthyl&#8208;based xanthene derivatives were prepared through the oxidation of BINOLs promoted by the hypervalent iodine reagent iodosylbenzene (PhIO). Nine&#8208;membered lactones were obtained through a similar oxidative reaction when iodoxybenzene (PhIO2) was used. Additionally, one&#8208;pot reactions of BINOLs, PhIO and nucleophiles such as alcohols and amines were also investigated to provide alkoxylated products and amides in good to excellent yields.

         <title>Thiourea&#8208; and Amino&#8208;Substituted Benzoxadiazole Dyes with Large Stokes Shifts as Red&#8208;Emitting Probe Monomers for Imprinted Polymer Layers Targeting Carboxylate&#8208;Containing Antibiotics</title>

Signalling in the red, when antibiotics are bound to novel dual functional donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;substituted benzoxadiazole probes with unprecedented large Stokes shifts, containing a benzoylthiourea receptor for carboxylate binding and a tertiary amine&#8208;appended methacrylate linker for covalent matrix incorporation. The selective binding of a model antibiotic enoxacin is achieved by the integration of the polymerizable probes into molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) shells on submicron silica particles, the dyes retaining their red&#8208;shifted emission based on two concerted intramolecular charge transfer processes.







Abstract
Bifunctional fluorescent molecular oxoanion probes based on the benzoxadiazole (BD) chromophore are described which integrate a thiourea binding motif and a polymerizable 2&#8208;aminoethyl methacrylate unit in the 4,7&#8208;positions of the BD core. Concerted charge transfer in this electron donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor architecture endows the dyes with strongly Stokes shifted (up to &gt;250&#8197;nm) absorption and fluorescence. Binding of electron&#8208;rich carboxylate guests at the thiourea receptor leads to further analyte&#8208;induced red&#8208;shifts of the emission, shifting the fluorescence maximum of the complexes to &#8805;700&#8197;nm. Association constants for acetate are ranging from 1&#8211;5&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1 in acetonitrile. Integration of one of the fluorescent probes through its polymerizable moiety into molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) grafted from the surface of submicron silica cores yielded fluorescent MIP&#8208;coated particle probes for the selective detection of antibiotics containing aliphatic carboxylate groups such as enoxacin (ENOX) at micromolar concentrations in highly polar solvents like acetonitrile.

         <title>Front Cover: Probing the Potential of Hitherto Unexplored Base&#8208;Stabilized Borylenes in Dinitrogen Binding (Chem. Eur. J. 21/2022)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 21, April 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite decades of intense research, metal&#8208;free binding of N2 is still a tantalizing goal. We have computationally explored di&#8208;coordinate, singly base&#8208;stabilized borylenes as candidates for N2 capture. Besides identifying key borylene&#8211;N2 adducts with low activation barriers, we reveal that the reaction exergonicity is linearly dependent on the natural charge at boron. These findings pave the way for the design of boron&#8208;based compounds with potential applications in small&#8208;molecule activation. More information can be found in the Research Article by F. Fantuzzi, H. Braunschweig, A.&#8197;K. Phukan et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104123). Cover designed by F.F.

         <title>Cover Feature: Unfolding the Role of Building Units of MOFs with Mechanistic Insight Towards Selective Metal Ions Detection in Water (Chem. Eur. J. 21/2022)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 21, April 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of the organic building units of MOFs towards selective detection of a targeted metal cation (Fe3+) has been demonstrated by systematic screening by varying the number of Lewis basic (pyridyl&#8208;N atoms) sites in a series of isostructural metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). All three fluorescent MOFs are seen to present a quenching response towards Fe3+ ions in water; however, only UiO&#8208;67@N exhibits highly selective and sensitive response, whereas the emission of both UiO&#8208;67 and UiO&#8208;67@NN is quenched by several metal ions. More information can be found in the Research Article by S.&#8197;K. Ghosh et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104175).

         <title>Frontispiece: Designable Guest&#8208;Molecule Encapsulation in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Proton Conductivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 21, April 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By encapsulating various designable molecules in metal organic frameworks (MOFs), the proton conductivity of composites can be improved. Here we classify these designable molecules into four types, and discuss the effect of their introduction on the improvement of the proton conductivity of MOFs. We hope to provide some feasible guidance for the design and development of future composite proton&#8208;conducting materials for MOFs encapsulating guest molecules. For more details, see the Review by C.&#8208;X. Zhang, Q.&#8208;L. Wang, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103732).

Ene&#8208;reductases (ERs) are valuable biocatalyst that engages in stereospecific reduction of activated C=C bonds and exhibit increased prominence in the production of pharmaceutical ingredients, agrochemical synthons, and fine chemicals. In addition to traditional biocatalysis, ERs evolved in multi&#8208;enzyme cascades, chemoenzymatic, photoenzymatic, photoelectrochemical, single&#8208;reduction chemistry, and radical&#8208;mediated transformation which unravels its versatility and multifaceted nature in organic transformations.

How to welcome guests: In this review, we summarize the current strategies for introducing guest molecules into MOFs to improve their proton conductivity, and divide the guest molecules into four types. We also present the challenges and prospects of applying this strategy for these solid proton conducting materials.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), as a porous frame material, exhibit considerable electrical conductivity. In recent decades, research on the proton conductivity of MOFs has made gratifying progress. In this review, the designable guest molecules encapsulated into MOFs are summarized and generalized into four types in terms of promoting proton conductive performance, and then recent progress in the promotion of proton conductivity by MOFs encapsulating guest molecules is discussed. The existing challenges and prospects for the development of this strategy for promoting MOFs&#8217; proton conductivity are also listed.

         <dc:description>
Ene&#8208;reductases (ERs) are a promising biocatalyst that reduces unsaturated double bonds cooperatively with transition metals, besides they are amiable with other emergent techniques like photoenzymatic, chemoenzymatic, multi&#8208;enzymatic, photoelectrochemical, single reduction chemistry, and radical&#8208;mediated transformations. These techniques will influence the enzymologist and synthetic chemist to explore and expand the intriguing chemistries displayed by ERs for academic and industrial purposes.







Abstract
Biocatalysis integrate microbiologists, enzymologists, and organic chemists to access the repertoire of pharmaceutical and agrochemicals with high chemoselectivity, regioselectivity, and enantioselectivity.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ene-reductases (ERs)&lt;/b&gt; are a promising biocatalyst that reduces unsaturated double bonds cooperatively with transition metals, besides they are amiable with other emergent techniques like photoenzymatic, chemoenzymatic, multi-enzymatic, photoelectrochemical, single reduction chemistry, and radical-mediated transformations. These techniques will influence the enzymologist and synthetic chemist to explore and expand the intriguing chemistries displayed by ERs for academic and industrial purposes.

         <title>Large Enhancement of the Single&#8208;Molecular Conductance of a Molecular Wire through a Radical Substituent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radical solution: Single&#8208;molecular conductances were compared between methyl&#8208; and iminonitroxide&#8208;substituted 4&#8208;(biphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;yl)pyridine wires bound on porphyrin template by STM apparent height measurement. Statistical analysis of the STM images revealed that the radical&#8208;substituted wire has 3.2&#177;1.7&#8208;fold larger conductance than the methyl&#8208;substituted reference, despite the fact that only 17&#8201;% of the SOMO is calculated to be distributed on the wire moiety.







Abstract
The single&#8208;molecular conductance between two &#960;&#8208;conjugated wires with and without a radical substituent has been compared. Specifically, methyl&#8208; and iminonitroxide&#8208;substituted 4&#8208;(biphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;yl)pyridine wires bound onto a porphyrin template were subjected to scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) apparent&#8208;height measurement at the interface between highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) and octan&#8208;1&#8208;oic acid. Statistical analysis of the STM images revealed that the radical&#8208;substituted wire has 3.2&#177;1.7&#8208;fold higher conductance than the methyl&#8208;substituted reference. Although density functional theory (DFT) calculation suggests that only 17&#8201;% of the SOMO is distributed on the wire moiety, the effect was significant. This study presents the potential of radical substituents to achieve high conductivity in molecular wires.

         <title>Design of Stimuli&#8208;responsive Phenthiazine Derivatives with Triplet&#8208;related Dual Emission and High&#8208;contrast Mechanochromism Guided by Polymorph Prediction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of high&#8208;contrast stimulus&#8208;responsive materials with excited triplet emission is of great significance for anti&#8208;counterfeiting, sensor and memory applications, but remains a challenge. Here, we report a strategy for rational design of stimulus&#8208;responsive phenothiazine derivatives with triplet&#8208;related dual emissions and high&#8208;contrast mechanochromism guided by Polymorph Prediction. The designed phenothiazine derivatives have the characters of simple structures, facile synthetic procedure and good crystalline nature. We found that the crystals of those derivatives with potential to form both quasi&#8208;axial (ax) and quasi&#8208;equatorial (eq) conformations could undergo conformation transition and show significant emission difference (&#916;&#955;em&gt; 100 nm) under mechanical force. Meanwhile, all these phenothiazine derivatives exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced emission character and emit room temperature phosphorescence or thermally activated delayed fluorescence. The significant luminescent change of these materials under different stimuli endows them promising applications in encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting fields.</dc:description>

         <title>GNPS**&#8208;guided discovery of madurastatins A1, A2, E1, F, and G1, siderophores from the termite&#8208;associated Actinomadura sp. RB99</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we analyzed if  Actinomadura  sp. RB99 produces siderophores that that could be responsible for the antimicrobial activity observed in co&#8208;cultivation studies. Dereplication of high&#8208;resolution tandem mass spectrometry (HRMS/MS) and global natural product social molecular networking platform (GNPS) analysis of fungus&#8208;bacterium co&#8208;cultures resulted in the identification of five madurastatin derivatives (A1, A2, E1, F, and G1), of which were four new derivatives. Chemical structures were unambiguously confirmed by HR&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS, 1D and 2D NMR experiments, as well as MS/MS data and their absolute structures were elucidated based on Marfey&#8217;s analysis, DP4+ probability calculation and total synthesis. Structure analysis revealed that madurastatin E1 (  2  ) contained a rare 4&#8208;imidazolidinone cyclic moiety and madurastatin A1 (  5  ) was characterized as a Ga  3+  &#8208;complex. The function of madurastatins as siderophores was evaluated using the fungal pathogen  Cryptococcus neoformans  as model organism. Based on homology models, we identified the putative NRPS&#8208;based gene cluster region of the siderophores in  Actinomadura  sp. RB99.</dc:description>

         <title>Size Effects of the Anions in the Ionothermal Synthesis of Carbon Nitride Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&lt;p class="Abstract"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN&#8208;US"&gt;Semiconducting carbon nitride polymers are used in metal&#8208;free photocatalysts and in opto&#8208;electronic devices. Conventionally, they are obtained using thermal and ionothermal syntheses in inscrutable, closed systems and therefore, their condensation behavior is poorly understood. Here, we compare the synthetic protocols and properties of two types of carbon nitride materials &amp;ndash; 2D layered poly(triazine imide) (PTI) and hydrogen&#8208;bonded melem hydrate &amp;ndash; obtained from three low&#8208;melting salt eutectics taken from the systematic series of the alkali metal halides: LiCl/KCl, LiBr/KBr, and LiI/KI. The size of the anion plays a significant role in the formation process of the condensed carbon nitride polymers, and it suggests a strong templating effect. The smaller anions (chloride and bromide) become incorporated into triazine (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&#8208;based PTI frameworks.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;p class="Abstract"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span lang="EN-US"&amp;gt;Semiconducting carbon nitride polymers are used in metal-free photocatalysts and in opto-electronic devices. Conventionally, they are obtained using thermal and ionothermal syntheses in inscrutable, closed systems and therefore, their condensation behavior is poorly understood. Here, we compare the synthetic protocols and properties of two types of carbon nitride materials &amp;ndash; 2D layered poly(triazine imide) (PTI) and hydrogen-bonded melem hydrate &amp;ndash; obtained from three low-melting salt eutectics taken from the systematic series of the alkali metal halides: LiCl/KCl, LiBr/KBr, and LiI/KI. The size of the anion plays a significant role in the formation process of the condensed carbon nitride polymers, and it suggests a strong templating effect. The smaller anions (chloride and bromide) become incorporated into triazine (C&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;N&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;)-based PTI frameworks. The larger iodide does not stabilize the formation of a triazine-based polymer, but instead it leads to the formation of the heptazine (C&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;6&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;N&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;7&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;)-based hydrogen-bonded melem hydrate as the main crystalline phase.

         <title>Multienzyme Biocatalytic Cascade Systems in Porous Organic Frameworks for Biosensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multienzyme biocatalytic cascade systems (MBCS) have attracted widespread research in the field of biosensing due to selective substrate transformations and signal amplification function. However, the poor stability of enzymes significantly restricts their effectiveness in practical applications. The spatial organization of MBCS within porous organic frameworks (POFs), such as metal&#8208;organic frameworks, covalent organic frameworks, and hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks, is regarded as a promising strategy to overcome these challenges. This advanced biotechnology sets up a POFs microenvironment for enzymes immobilization, and thus enable to shield of the enzyme from the external stimulus by POFs&#8208;guided structural confinement. Simultaneously, the tailorable porous structure of POFs shell allows the selectivity transport of substrates into interior enzymes, thereby accelerating the sensing process. Herein, we present the concept of this POFs&#8208;confined MBCS, wherein enzymes were completed encapsulated into, rather than adsorption onto, the POFs. We highlight the new strategies for MBCS spatial organization through rational POFs support, and describe how this new bio&#8208;nanosystem that integrates framework and enzymes functions can be designed as a versatile biosensing platform. In addition, the challenges and outlooks are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular engineering of star&#8208;shaped indoline hole transport materials: The influence of planarity on the hole extraction and transport processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As the key properties of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the hole extraction and transport capabilities of the hole transport material (HTM) affect the photovoltaic performance of PSCs to considerable extent, while both capabilities can be adjusted by molecular planarity. Therefore, in this work, the molecular planarity of the HTM is systematically optimized to regulate the hole extraction and transport capabilities. Along with the improvement in planarity, the HTM's HOMO level is increased, leading to the enhancement of hole extraction capability. Meanwhile, the hole transport capability can also be improved due to the intensification of molecular stacking during the film formation. As a result, the planar HTM achieves a relatively high efficiency of 18.48%, which is higher than that of spiro  &#8208;OMeTAD. Accordingly, the molecular planarity presents an important impact on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, providing us a promising strategy for the further optimization of efficient HTMs.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Isolation of A Labile Silylated Hydrazinium&#8208;yl Radical Cation, [(Me3Si)2N&#8208;N(H)SiMe3]&#8226;+</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxidation of silylated hydrazine, (Me3Si)2N&#8208;N(H)SiMe3, with silver salts led to the formation of a highly labile hydrazinium&#8208;yl radical cation, [(Me3Si)2N&#8208;N(H)SiMe3]&#8226;+, at very low temperatures (decomposition &gt; &#8211;40 &#176;C). EPR, NMR, DFT and Raman studies revealed the formation of a nitrogen&#8208;centered radical cation along the N&#8208;N unit of the hydrazine. In the presence of the weakly coordinating anion [Al{OCH(CF3)2}4]&#8211;, crystallization and structural characterization in the solid state were achieved. The hydrazinium&#8208;yl radical cation has a significantly shortened N&#8208;N bond and a nearly planar N2Si3 frame&#173;work in contrast to the starting material. According to DFT calculations, the shortened N&#8208;N bond has a total bond order of 1.5 with a &#960; bond order of 0.5. The &#960; bond can be regarded as a 3&#8208;&#960;&#8208;electron 2&#8208;center bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial charge modulation via in&#8208;situ fabrication of 3D conductive platform with MOF nanoparticles for photocatalytic reduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly&#8208;efficient photocatalytic conversion of CO  2  into valuable carbon&#8208;contained chemicals possesses a tremendous potential in solving the energy crisis and global warming problem. However, the inadequate separation of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs and the unsatisfied capture of CO  2  stay the chief roadblocks. Herein, we designed a novel photocatalyst for CO  2  reduction by assembling three&#8208;dimensional graphene (3D GR) with a typical metal&#8208;organic framework material UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  , aiming to construct a built&#8208;in electric field for charge separation as well as taking advantage of the typical 3D structure of GR for maximizing the exposed absorption site on the surface. The performance evaluation demonstrated that the photocatalytic activity has been promoted for the composite materials than that of the pure UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  . Further mechanism investigations proved the enhanced photocatalytic performance is attributed to the synergy of enhanced CO  2  absorption and inhibited photogenerated charge recombination, which could be owing to the better distribution and exposure of absorption and reaction sites on composites, and the redistribution of photogenerated carriers between 3D GR and UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  , respectively. This study may furnish a promising pathway to probe nanocomposites based on MOFs in environmental improvement and other relevant fields.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An efficient strategy for the synthesis of large libraries of conformationally defined peptides is reported, using dynamic

combinatorial chemistry as a tool to graft amino acid side chains on a well&#8208;ordered 3D peptide backbone. Combining rationally designed scaffolds with combinatorial side chains selection represents an alternative method to access peptide libraries for structures that are not genetically encodable.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Conjugated Copper Phthalocyanine Nanoparticles as Highly Sensitive Sensor for Colorimetric Detection of Biomarkers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Though numerous nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like activities have been utilized as probes and sensors to detect biological molecules, it is still challenging to construct polymeric materials as highly sensitive detectors for biomarkers. Benefiting from the &#960;&#8208;d delocalization e&#64256;ect of electrons, excellent metal&#8208;chelating property, high electron transferability, and good chemical stability of &#960;&#8208;conjugated phthalocyanine, here, we report to design the copper phthalocyanine&#8208;based conjugated polymer nanoparticles (Cu&#8208;PcCP NPs) as a colorimetric sensor for a variety of biomarkers. The Cu&#8208;PcCP NPs are synthesized through a simple microwave&#8208;assisted polymerization, and their chemical structures are thoroughly characterized. The colorimetric results of Cu&#8208;PcCP NPs demonstrate excellent peroxidase&#8208;like detecting activity and also great substrate selectivity than most of the reported Cu&#8208;based nanomaterials. The Cu&#8208;PcCP NPs can achieve a detection limit of 4.88 &#956;M for the H  2  O  2  , 4.27 &#956;M for the L&#8208;cysteine, and 21.10 &#956;M for the glucose via a cascade catalytic system, which shows comparable detecting sensitivity as that of many earlier reported enzyme&#8208;like nanomaterials. Moreover, Cu&#8208;PcCP NPs present remarkable resistance to harsh conditions, including high temperature, low pH, excessive salts, etc. This highly specific &#960;&#8208;conjugated copper&#8208;phthalocyanine nanoparticle not only overcomes the current limitation of polymeric material&#8208;based sensors but also provides a new direction for designing next&#8208;generation enzyme&#8208;like nanomaterial&#8208;based colorimetric biosensors.</dc:description>

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Dual Phosphorescence from (o&#8208;Bromophenyl)&#8208;Bis(2,6&#8208;Dimethylphenyl)Borane at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bromo&#8208;triarylborane o&#8208;BrTAB exhibits dual phosphorescence at room temperature; a short&#8208;lived higher energy emission originates from single molecules (T1M) whereas the long&#8208;lived component at lower energy results from an aggregate (T1A). Under 365&#8197;nm UV light irradiation, crystalline o&#8208;BrTAB emits bright pale blue light (fluorescence). After turning off the light, a persistent yellow afterglow remains for 2&#8197;s.







Abstract
Designing highly efficient purely organic phosphors at room temperature remains a challenge because of fast non&#8208;radiative processes and slow intersystem crossing (ISC) rates. The majority of them emit only single component phosphorescence. Herein, we have prepared 3 isomers (o, m, p&#8208;bromophenyl)&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;dimethylphenyl)boranes. Among the 3 isomers (o&#8208;, m&#8208; and p&#8208;BrTAB) synthesized, the ortho&#8208;one is the only one which shows dual phosphorescence, with a short lifetime of 0.8&#8197;ms and a long lifetime of 234&#8197;ms in the crystalline state at room temperature. Based on theoretical calculations and crystal structure analysis of o&#8208;BrTAB, the short lifetime component is ascribed to the T1M state of the monomer which emits the higher energy phosphorescence. The long&#8208;lived, lower energy phosphorescence emission is attributed to the T1A state of an aggregate, with multiple intermolecular interactions existing in crystalline o&#8208;BrTAB inhibiting nonradiative decay and stabilizing the triplet states efficiently.

         <title>Anomeric Stereoauxiliary Cleavage of the C&#8722;N Bond of d&#8208;Glucosamine for the Preparation of Imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An &#945;&#8208;anomeric stereoauxiliary strategy for the targeted cleavage of C&#8722;N bonds in d&#8208;glucosamine was achieved through a seven&#8208;membered ring transition&#8208;state intermediate and the simultaneous incorporation of amine moieties in imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines. This method provides a novel strategy for the C&#8722;N bond cleavage and unlocks efficient access to diverse imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines blocks bearing versatile functional groups.







Abstract
The targeted cleavage of the C&#8722;N bonds of alkyl primary amines in sustainable compounds of biomass according to a metal&#8208;free pathway and the conjunction of nitrogen in the synthesis of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines are still highly challenging. Despite tremendous progress in the synthesis of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines over the past decade, many of them can still not be efficiently prepared. Herein, we report an anomeric stereoauxiliary approach for the synthesis of a wide range of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines after cleaving the C&#8722;N bond of d&#8208;glucosamine (&#945;&#8208;2&#176; amine) from biobased resources. This new approach expands the scope of readily accessible imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines relative to existing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods. A key strategic advantage of this approach is that the &#945;&#8208;anomer of d&#8208;glucosamine enables C&#8722;N bond cleavage via a seven&#8208;membered ring transition state. By using this novel method, a series of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine derivatives (&gt;80 examples) was synthesized from pyridine ketones (including para&#8208;dipyridine ketone) and aldehydes (including para&#8208;dialdehyde). Imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine derivatives containing diverse important deuterated C(sp2)&#8722;H and C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds were also efficiently achieved.

         <title>Superassembled Hierarchical Asymmetric Magnetic Mesoporous Nanorobots Driven by Smart Confined Catalytic Degradation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Set in motion: A hierarchical, asymmetric, magnetic, mesoporous, hollow nanorobot was constructed according to a sequential, interfacial superassembly strategy. This nanorobot integrated magnetic responsiveness, confined catalytic degradation, durable motion, recyclability into a single system; this not only sets a platform for manipulating its motion, but also provides a promising tool for various future applications.







Abstract
Micro/nanoscale robotics has received great attention in many important fields. However, it is still a great challenge to construct nanorobots simultaneously possessing multifunctionality, well&#8208;controlled directionality, and fast and durable motion as well as fully compatible and biodegradable components. Here, a hierarchical, asymmetric, hollow, catalytic, magnetic, and mesoporous nanorobot has been fabricated through a multistep interfacial superassembly strategy. The multilayer composites consist of hollow silica nanoflasks sequentially coated with a highly magnetic responsive Fe3O4 layer, a mesoporous silica layer with homogeneous vertical channels, and a layer of catalytic gold nanoparticles on both the inner and outer surfaces. Furthermore, para&#8208;nitrophenol was used as a model pollutant to trigger self&#8208;motility of the nanoflasks by confined catalytic degradation (CCD). We found that the bottleneck morphology and mesoporous surface both improved the catalytic nanoparticle loading capability and CCD effect, thus enabling efficient self&#8208;motility and a durable movement capacity of &#8764;100&#8197;h. In addition, the catalytic performance was improved by 180&#8201;% compared with that of solid spherical nanoparticles.

         <title>Zwitterionic Block Copolymers for the Synthesis and Stabilization of Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel synthesis of cesium lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) is enabled by replacing conventional small molecule ligands with zwitterion&#8208;containing block copolymers (BCPs) that are soluble in liquid phases useful for hot injection PNC syntheses. PNCs prepared in this manner are obtained in high yields with bright photoluminescence, with the zwitterionic BCPs facilitating efficient PNC isolation, long&#8208;term stability, and direct conversion to nanocomposite films.







Abstract
Traditional hot injection methods for the preparation of cesium lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (CsPbX3 PNCs, where X=Cl, Br, or I) rely on small molecule surfactants to produce PNCs with cube, plate, or rod&#8208;like morphologies. Here, we describe a new method whereby zwitterionic block copolymers are employed as macromolecular ligands in PNC synthesis, affording PNCs with excellent colloidal stability, high photoluminescence quantum yield, and in some cases distinctly non&#8208;cubic shapes. The block copolymers used in this study &#8211; composed of a poly(n&#8208;butyl methacrylate) hydrophobic block and zwitterionic methacrylate hydrophilic blocks &#8211; dissolve in useful solvents for PNC growth despite containing large mole percentages of zwitterionic groups. PNCs prepared with block copolymer ligands were found to disperse and retain their fluorescence in a range of polar organic solvents and were amenable to direct integration into optically transparent nanocomposite thin films with high PNC content.

         <title>Formation of an Azaruthenacyclopentadiene Skeleton via Ammonia Activation by an Electron&#8208;Deficient Ru3 Cluster</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

A &#956;&#8208;amido complex was obtained by the reaction of a dicationic triruthenium complex containing a &#956;3&#8208;&#951;3&#8208;C3 ring with NH3. Subsequent treatment with base caused C&#8722;N bond formation, yielding a &#956;3&#8208;azaruthenacyclopentadienyl complex. The azaruthenacyclopentadiene skeleton was alternatively synthesized by the photolysis of a mono&#8208;cationic analogue in an NH3 atmosphere, in which the C3 ring skeleton was broken via the electron transfer to the &#960;*(C&#8722;C) orbital in the C3 ring

A dicationic triruthenium complex containing a &#956;3&#8208;&#951;3&#8208;C3 ring, [(Cp*Ru)3(&#956;3&#8208;&#951;3&#8208;C3MeH2&#8722;)(&#956;3&#8208;CH)(&#956;&#8208;H)]2+ (1&#8201;a, Cp*=&#951;5&#8208;C5Me5), reacted with ammonia to yield a &#956;&#8208;amido complex, [(Cp*Ru)3(&#956;3&#8208;&#951;3&#8208;CHCMeCH) (&#956;3&#8208;CH)(&#956;&#8208;NH2)]2+ (5), via N&#8722;H bond scission. Subsequent treatment with base resulted in C&#8722;N bond formation to yield a &#956;3&#8208;&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;1&#8208;azabutadien&#8208;4&#8208;yl complex, [(Cp*Ru)3(&#956;3&#8208;CH)(&#956;3&#8208;&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;NH=CH&#8722;CMe=CH&#8722;)]+ (6&#8201;a). The azaruthenacyclopentadiene skeleton was alternatively synthesized by the photolysis of mono&#8208;cationic complex [(Cp*Ru)3(&#956;3&#8208;&#951;3&#8208;C3RH2&#8722;)(&#956;3&#8208;CH)]+ (2&#8201;a; R=Me, 2&#8201;b; R=H) in the presence of ammonia. The C3 ring skeleton was broken via the electron transfer to the &#960;*(C&#8722;C) orbital in the C3 ring, and a transiently generated unsaturated &#956;3&#8208;allylic species can take up ammonia, resulting in N&#8722;H bond scission followed by C&#8722;N bond formation.

         <title>Optimization of an Asymmetric Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Held in place: Aromatic oligoamide sequences can regulate the stereochemistry of an asymmetric reaction in helical cavities. The modular construction design of the sequences confers the ease of sequential modification, whereby the diastereoselectivity of the asymmetric reaction significantly increases with diastereomeric excess from 9 to 90&#8201;% after a few progressive optimizations.







Abstract
An asymmetric reaction can be implemented and refined in the helical cavity of aromatic oligoamide sequences. These sequences, which bear a chiral inducer, can fold into helical structures with absolute control of the helical sense, whereby a ketone substrate covalently linked in the cavity can be asymmetrically reduced to diastereomers. The diastereoselectivity of the reduction is highly dependent on the shielding efficiency of the helical cavity. Iterative modifications of the sequence, such as addition and replacement of monomers, can fine&#8208;tune the cavity to realize the asymmetric reaction, thereby progressively increasing the diastereomeric excess up to 90&#8201;%.

         <title>The Influence of UiO&#8208;66 Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Structural Defects on Adsorption and Separation of Hexane Isomers</title>

The presence of structural defects in the crystal lattice of the microporous UiO&#8208;66 metal&#8211;organic framework affects the adsorption and separation of constitutional isomers of hexane. Experimental adsorption isobars were recreated using Monte Carlo molecular modelling in order to fully understand the observed phenomena at the molecular level.







Abstract
In this work, adsorption properties of the UiO&#8208;66 metal&#8211;organic framework were investigated, with particular emphasis on the influence of structural defects. A series of UiO&#8208;66 samples were synthesized and characterized using a wide range of experimental techniques. Type I adsorption isotherms for low&#8208;temperature adsorption of N2 and Ar showed that micropore volume and specific surface area significantly increase with the number of defects. Adsorption of hexane isomers in UiO&#8208;66 was studied by means of quasi&#8208;equilibrated temperature&#8208;programmed desorption and adsorption (QE&#8208;TPDA) experimental and Monte Carlo simulation techniques. QE&#8208;TPDA profiles revealed that only defect&#8208;free UiO&#8208;66 exhibits distinct two adsorption states. This technique also yielded high&#8208;quality adsorption isobars that were successfully recreated using Grand&#8208;Canonical Monte Carlo molecular simulations, which, however, required refinement of the existing force fields. The calculations demonstrated the detailed mechanism of adsorption and separation of hexane isomers in the UiO&#8208;66 structure. The preferred tetrahedral cages provide suitable voids for bulky molecules, which is the reason for unusual &#8220;reverse&#8221; selectivity of UiO&#8208;66 towards di&#8208;branched alkanes. Interconnection of the tetrahedral cavities due to missing organic linkers greatly reduces the selectivity of the defected material.

Crystal chameleons: Sterically frustrated aromatic enes (FAEs) composed of a 10&#8208;methyleneanthrone and two bulky aromatic rings contain a twisted C=C bond as well as a folded anthrone unit. Their solid&#8208;state energy landscapes show the presence of metastable intermediate crystals corresponding to conformations with different folds, twists and dihedral angles. Moreover, these FAE crystals have different absorption and emission colors from yellow to dark red that change in response to external stimuli, such as grinding, pressure, and heating.







Abstract
Overcrowded ethylenes composed of 10&#8208;methyleneanthrone and two bulky aromatic rings contain a twisted carbon&#8211;carbon double (C=C) bond as well as a folded anthrone unit. As such, they are unique frustrated aromatic enes (FAEs). Various colored crystals of these FAEs, obtained in different solvents, correspond to multiple metastable conformations of the FAEs with various twist and fold angles of the C=C bond, as well as various dihedral angles of attached aryl units with respect to the C=C bond. The relationships between color and these parameters associated with conformational features around the C=C bond were elucidated in experimental and computational studies. Owing to the fact that they are separated by small energy barriers, the variously colored conformations in the FAE crystal change in response to various external stimuli, such as mechanical grinding, hydrostatic pressure and thermal heating.

The corresponding enantiomers  2  S  &#8208;  4  S  have been obtained from  1  S  containing (  S,S  )&#8208;Skewphos. Reaction of  2  R  and  2  S  with (  S  )&#8208;cysteine and NaPF  6  at pH = 9 gives the diastereoisomers [Ru((  S  )&#8208;Cys)(CO)(PP)(phen)]PF  6  (PP = (  R,R  )&#8208;Skewphos  2  R  &#8208;Cys; (  S,S  )&#8208;Skewphos  2  S  &#8208;Cys). The DFT energetic profile for  2  R  with (  S  )&#8208;cysteine in H  2  O indicates that aquo and hydroxo species are involved in formation of  2  R  &#8208;Cys. The stability of the ruthenium complexes in 0.9% w/v NaCl solution, PBS and complete DMEM medium, as well as their  n  &#8208;octanol/water partition coefficient (logP), have been evaluated. The chiral complexes show high cytotoxic activity against SW1736, 8505C, HCT&#8208;116 and A549 cell lines with EC  50  values of 2.8&#8208;0.04  &#181;  M. The (  R  ,  R  )&#8208;Skewphos derivatives show higher cytotoxicity compared to their enantiomers,  4  R  (EC  50  = 0.04  &#181;  M) being 14 times more cytotoxic than  4  S  against the anaplastic thyroid cancer 8505C cell line.</dc:description>

         <title>A composite of two dimensional GeSe2/nitrogen&#8208;doped reduced graphene oxide for enhanced capacitive lithium&#8208;ion storage</title>

         <dc:description>A composite of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) GeSe  2  nanosheets dispersed on N&#8208;doped reduced graphene oxide (GeSe  2  /N&#8208;rGO) is fabricated via a simple hydrothermal method combined with post&#8208;selenization process. The high electronic conductivity and the substantial void spaces of the wrinkled N&#8208;rGO can improve the electrical conductivity of the active material and accommodate the volume evolution of GeSe  2  nanosheets during the (de)lithiation processes, while GeSe  2  nanosheets can reduce ion diffusion length effectively. Meanwhile, the unique layered structure is beneficial to the contact of the active material and electrolyte, and the reversibility of conversion reaction has also been improved. Furthermore, kinetics analysis reveals a pseudocapacitance&#8208;dominated Li  +  &#8208;storage mechanism at high rates.  In&#8208;situ  X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis discloses that the conversion reaction has played a certain part in Li  +  &#8208;storage. Thus, the GeSe  2  /N&#8208;rGO composite delivers excellent rate capability and good long&#8208;term stability with a high reversible capacity of 711.0 mA h g  &#8722;1  after 2000 cycles at 1 A g  &#8722;1  .</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure Reaction Profiles and Activation Volumes of 1,3&#8208;Cyclohexadiene Dimerizations Computed by the Extreme Pressure&#8208;Polarizable Continuum Model (XP&#8208;PCM)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
XP&#8208;PCM calculations on the thermal dimerizations of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene show that, going from the stepwise to the concerted [4+2] cycloaddition and finally to the concerted [6+4]&#8208;ene mechanisms, as the facial overlap between the rings increases in the transition state structure, the volume of the transition state decreases, leading to a more negative activation volume and increasing reaction acceleration under pressure.







Abstract
Quantum chemical calculations are reported for the thermal dimerizations of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene at 1&#8197;atm and high pressures up to the GPa range. Computed activation enthalpies of plausible dimerization pathways at 1&#8197;atm agree well with the experiment activation energies and the values from previous calculations. High&#8208;pressure reaction profiles, computed by the recently developed extreme pressure&#8208;polarizable continuum model (XP&#8208;PCM), show that the reduction of reaction barrier is more profound in concerted reactions than in stepwise reactions, which is rationalized on the basis of the volume profiles of different mechanisms. A clear shift of the transition state towards the reactant under pressure is revealed for the [6+4]&#8208;ene reaction by the calculations. The computed activation volumes by XP&#8208;PCM agree excellently with the experimental values, confirming the existence of competing mechanisms in the thermal dimerization of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene.

         <title>One&#8208;pot Approach for Bio&#8208;based Arylamines via a Combined Photooxidative Dearomatization&#8208;Rearomatization Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of arylamines from renewable resources under mild reaction conditions is highly desired for the sustainability of the chemical industry, where the production of hazardous waste is a prime concern. However, to date, there are very few tools in chemists&#8217; toolboxes that are able to produce arylamines in a sustainable manner. Herein, a robust one&#8208;pot approach for constructing bio&#8208;based arylamines via a combined photooxidative dearomatization&#8208;rearomatization strategy is presented. The developed methodology enables the synthesis of structurally complex amines in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good isolated yields using biomass&#8208;derived phenols, natural &#945;&#8208;amino acids, and naphthols under remarkably mild reaction conditions. For the photooxygenation of phenols, a novel chrysazine&#8208;based catalyst system was introduced, demonstrating its efficiency for the synthesis of natural products &#8211; hallerone and rengyolone and the pharmaceutically relevant prodrug DHED.</dc:description>

         <title>Isomorphic Fluorescent Nucleosides Facilitate a Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of RNA Depurination by Ribosome Inactivating Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ribosome&#8208;inactivating proteins, a family of highly cytotoxic proteins  , interfere with protein synthesis by depurinating a specific adenosine residue within the conserved  &#945;&#8208;sarcin/ricin loop  of eukaryotic ribosomal RNA. Besides being biological warfare agents, certain RIPs have been promoted as potential therapeutic tools.&#160; Monitoring their deglycosylation activity and its inhibition in real time has remained, however, elusive. Herein, we describe the enzymatic preparation and utility of consensus RIP hairpin substrates in which specific G residues, neighboring the depurination site, are surgically replaced with  tz  G and  th  G, fluorescent G analogs. By strategically modifying key positions with responsive fluorescent surrogate nucleotides, RIP&#8208;mediated depurination can be monitored in real&#8208;time by steady state fluorescence spectroscopy. Subtle differences observed in preferential depurination sites provide insight into the RNA folding as well as RIPs&#8217; substrate recognition features.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing the Influence of Diverse Secondary Metal Cations on Redox&#8208;Active Palladium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Incorporation of redox&#8208;inactive metals into redox&#8208;active complexes and catalysts attracts attention for engendering new reactivity modes, but this strategy has not been extensively investigated beyond the first&#8208;row of the transition metals. Here, the isolation and characterization of the first series of heterobimetallic complexes of palladium with mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and tri&#8208;valent redox&#8208;inactive metal ions are reported. A Reinhoudt&#8208;type heteroditopic ligand with a salen&#8208;derived [  N  2  ,  O  2  ] binding site for Pd and a crown&#8208;ether&#8208;derived [  O  6  ] site has been used to prepare isolable adducts of the Lewis acidic redox&#8208;inactive metal ions (  M  n+  ). Comprehensive data from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis reveal distinctive trends in the structural properties of the heterobimetallic species, including an uncommon dependence of the Pd&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;  M  distance on Lewis acidity. The reorganization energy associated with reduction of the heterobimetallic species is strongly modulated by Lewis acidity, with the slowest heterogeneous electron transfer kinetics associated with the strongest incorporated Lewis acids. This hitherto unexplored reorganization energy penalty for electron transfer contrasts with prior thermodynamic studies, revealing that kinetic parameters should be considered in studies of reactivity involving heterobimetallic species.</dc:description>

         <title>Peroxynitrite&#8208;Promoted Persulfide Prodrugs with Protective Potential against Paracetamol Poisoning</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The newly emerging persulfide prodrugs provide additional options for the profound study of persulfide, a fascinating molecule expected to intervene in biological functions and even diseases. Peroxynitrite is often the culprit in pathological processes characterized by oxidative stress, while the persulfide prodrug responsive to it is still pending. To enrich the family of redox&#8208;activated prodrugs, we designed prodrugs with a 2&#8208;oxo&#8208;2&#8208;phenylacetamide trigger, which achieved the release of persulfide via 1, 6&#8208;  N  ,  S  &#8208;relay. The degradation of prodrugs and the formation of persulfides were confirmed to be peroxynitrite&#8208;responsible by the qualitative and quantitative studies based on LC&#8208;MS/MS methods and a spectrophotometry&#8208;based tag&#8208;switch strategy. Furthermore, these prodrugs showed potent peroxynitrite scavenging activity, cellular therapeutic potential against paracetamol poisoning in HepG2 and oxidative stress in H9c2, as well as desirable  in vitro  metabolic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction: from Discrete Molecular Catalysts to Their Integrated Catalytic Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses the recent developments in design principles, structural tuning and integration strategies of molecular catalysts for electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 and provides a perspective on their future challenges and opportunities.







Abstract
Molecular catalysts (metal complexes), with molecularly defined uniform active sites and atomically precise structural tailorability allowing for regulating catalytic performance through metal&#8208; and ligand&#8208;centered engineering and elucidating reaction mechanisms via routine photoelectrochemical characterizations, have been increasingly explored for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (ECR). However, their poor stability and low catalytic current density are undesirable for practical applications. Heterogenizing discrete molecular catalysts can potentially surmount these issues, and the resulting integrated catalysts largely share catalytical properties with their discrete molecular counterparts, which bridge the gap between heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis and combine their advantages. This minireview surveys advances in design and regulation of molecular catalysts such as porphyrin, phthalocyanine, and bipyridine&#8208;based metal complexes and their integrated catalytic materials for selective ECR.

         <title>Homogeneous&#8208;to&#8208;Heterogeneous&#8208;Strategy Enables Multifunctional Phase&#8208;Change Materials for Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homogenous&#8208;to&#8208;heterogenous&#8208;strategy was raised as a concept to enable the fabrication of multifunctional phase change materials (PCMs). The as&#8208;prepared PCM was endowed with enhanced thermal performance, shape flexibility, and organic pollutant removing function. This novel strategy is expected to be one of universal PCMs encapsulation method.







Abstract
Functional phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs) are conspicuously absent in various organic or inorganic solids with diversified applications in which the attributes of these molecular materials have been highly realized. Leakage problem during the phase transition process is the main obstacle on the way of widely use of solid&#8208;liquid PCMs who has been recognized to be promisingly practical candidates for energy storage owing to the high energy storage density and small volume change in the phase transition process. Herein, a novel homogeneous&#8208;to&#8208;heterogeneous&#8208;strategy, in which all the starting materials involved display a homogeneous state and the encapsulation framework formed in&#8197;situ in the encapsulation process, enabled by an aerogel reaction of silica was realized under the catalysis of an organic base. Besides the comprehensive study upon energy storage performance, light&#8208;to&#8208;thermal conversion and recyclability performance study of the obtained materials reveal the clear superiority over pristine paraffin wax (PW) thanks to the versatility and robustness of this fabrication method. More importantly, the homogeneous&#8208;to&#8208;heterogeneous&#8208;strategy endows a unique adsorption ability with respect to organic pollutant due to the PCMs inside and therefore bearing a great potential to be used in environment protection fields.

Design of efficient catalysts is crucial for achieving highly efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction. In this review, the recent advances in design and preparation of the catalysts by electrodeposition and their applications in electrochemical CO2 reduction are highlighted.

Abstract
With the increasing emission of carbon dioxide (CO2), the conversion and utilization of CO2 have become a topic of increasing concern. Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is an attractive and sustainable approach for solving energy and environmental problems. Design of efficient catalysts is crucial for achieving highly efficient CO2RR. Different methods to prepare catalysts have been reported and used. Among them, electrodeposition is one of the common approaches, which has some obvious advantages, such as requiring simple equipment, environmentally benign. Especially, it can direct deposit catalysts on different substrates to prepare electrodes for CO2RR. In this review, we discuss recent advances in design and preparation of the catalysts by electrodeposition and their applications in CO2RR. Furthermore, the perspective of this promising area is also discussed.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the increasing emission of carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), the conversion and utilization of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; have become a topic of increasing concern. Electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) is an attractive and sustainable approach for solving energy and environmental problems. Design of efficient catalysts is crucial for achieving highly efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR. Different methods to prepare catalysts have been reported and used. Among them, electrodeposition is one of the common approaches, which has some obvious advantages, such as requiring simple equipment, environmentally benign. Especially, it can direct deposit catalysts on different substrates to prepare electrodes for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR. In this review, we discuss recent advances in design and preparation of the catalysts by electrodeposition and their applications in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR. Furthermore, the perspective of this promising area is also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Deep&#8208;Blue Luminescent Twisted Diphenylamino Terphenyl Emitters by Bromine&#8208;Lithium Exchange Borylation&#8208;Suzuki Sequence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shining in deep blue: Four highly luminescent emitters can be obtained by a bromine&#8208;lithium exchange borylation&#8208;Suzuki (BLEBS) sequence in a one&#8208;pot fashion. Photophysical properties, such as deep&#8208;blue emission with high quantum yields in different surroundings, make this class of functional chromophores attractive for applications.







Abstract
Four novel intensively blue luminescent chromophores were readily synthesized by bromine&#8208;lithium exchange borylation&#8208;Suzuki (BLEBS) sequence in moderate to good yields. Their electronic properties were studied by absorption and emission spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations revealing deep&#8208;blue emission in solution as well as in the solid state and upon embedding into a PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate) matrix with small FWHM (full width at half maximum) values and CIE y values smaller than 0.1. Moreover, high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY), partially close to unity, are found.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Csp2&#8722;OMe Functionalization for Chemoselective Aromatic Homologation En Route to Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni(0)&#8208;catalyzed methodology efficiently achieves Csp2&#8722;OMe functionalization in the presence of internal alkynes, forming chemoselectively either aromatic homologation or intramolecular monoannulation products. Furthermore, aromatic homologation products are proven as valid precursors for further diversification towards nanographene&#8208;like synthesis.







Abstract
A Ni&#8208;catalyzed Csp2&#8722;OMe ortho&#8208;functionalization methodology to form chemoselectively alkyne monoannulation or aromatic homologation products is reported as a novel protocol towards the valorisation of substrates containing Csp2&#8722;OMe units. Double activation of Csp2&#8722;OMe and Csp2&#8722;F bonds is also demonstrated. Further use of aromatic homologation products towards the synthesis of nanographene&#8208;like compounds is described.

         <title>Diarylcuprates for Selective Syntheses of Multifunctionalized Ketones from Thioesters under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of ketone as a synthetic intermediate of canagliflozin from a gluconolactone&#8208;derived thioester and a Grignard reagent with the aid of copper is likened to making Taiyaki, a Japanese fish&#8208;shaped waffle with sweet red bean inside. The thioester (sweet red beans) and the Grignard reagent (waffle batter) are baked on a copper waffle iron to get the desired ketone as Taiyaki. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Tsurugi, M. Seki, K. Mashima, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200474).

         <title>Catalytic Reduction of Dinitrogen into Ammonia and Hydrazine by Using Chromium Complexes Bearing PCP&#8208;Type Pincer Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of chromium complexes bearing a carbene&#8208; and phosphine&#8208;based PCP&#8208;type pincer ligand has been newly prepared, and some of them are found to work as effective catalysts to reduce dinitrogen into ammonia and hydrazine under atmospheric pressure. This reaction can be expressed as nitrogen molecules (raindrops) being converted into ammonia and hydrazine on the chromium complex (umbrella). More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Yoshizawa, Y. Nishibayashi et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200557).

         <title>Boron&#8208;Locked Starazine &#8211; A Soluble and Fluorescent Analogue of Starphene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first counterpart of starphene, namely starazine, that contains a nonaaza&#8208;core structure and three peripheral isoquinoline units locked by three tetracoordinate borons to form a quasi&#8208;planar backbone is described. This starazine possesses a non&#8208;aromatic and electron&#8208;deficient core due to the introduction of the heteroatoms replacing the corresponding carbon atoms in starphene. The transition to its lowest excited state is allowed, sharply contrasting to the starphenes, endowing fluorescent properties to this novel starlike dye molecule.







Abstract
A starlike heterocyclic molecule containing an electron&#8208;deficient nonaaza&#8208;core structure and three peripheral isoquinolines locked by three tetracoordinate borons, namely isoquinoline&#8208;nona&#8208;starazine (QNSA), is synthesized by using readily available reactants through a rather straightforward approach. This new heteroatom&#8208;rich QNSA possesses a quasi&#8208;planar &#960;&#8208;backbone structure, and bears phenyl substituents on borons which protrude on both sides of the &#960;&#8208;backbones endowing it with good solubility in common organic solvents. Contrasting to its starphene analogue, QNSA shows intense fluorescence with a quantum yield (PLQY) of up to 62&#8201;% in dilute solution.

         <title>Renaissance of Topotactic Ion&#8208;Exchange for Functional Solids with Close Packed Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, many new, complex, functional oxides have been discovered with the surprising use of topotactic ion&#8208;exchange reactions on close&#8208;packed structures, such as found for wurtzite, rutile, perovskite, and other structure types.&#160; Despite a lack of apparent cation&#8208;diffusion pathways in these structure types, synthetic low&#8208;temperature transformations are possible with the interdiffusion and exchange of functional cations possessing n  s  2  stereoactive lone pairs (e.g., Sn(II)) or unpaired n  d  x  electrons (e.g., Co(II)), targeting new and favorable modulations of their electronic, magnetic, or catalytic properties.&#160; This enables a synergistic blending of new functionality to an underlying three&#8208;dimensional connectivity, i.e., [&#8208;M&#8208;O&#8208;M&#8208;O&#8208;]  n  , that is maintained during the transformation.&#160; In many cases, this tactic represents the only known pathway to prepare thermodynamically unstable solids that otherwise would commonly decompose by phase segregation, such as recently been applied to the discovery of many new small bandgap semiconductors.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Hydrosilylation of gem&#8208;Difluorocyclopropenes Leading to a Stereochemical Study of the Silylated gem&#8208;Difluorocyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optically active cyclopropanes have been widely investigated especially from the views of pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries, and substituting one of the methylenes with the gem&#8208; difluoromethylene unit should be promising for developing novel biologically relevant compounds and functional materials. In this paper, we disclose copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrosilylation of gem &#8208;difluorocyclopropenes providing the corresponding chiral gem &#8208;difluorocyclopropanes. Use of copper(I) chloride, chiral ligands including bidentate BINAPs and monodentate phosphoramidites, and silylborane Me 2 PhSi&#8208;Bpin accompanying sodium t &#8208;butoxide in methanol was appropriate for the enantioselective hydrosilylation of the strained C=C double bond, and the resultant chiral difluorinated three&#8208;membered ring was unambiguously characterized. Subsequent activation of the silyl groups in enantio&#8208;enriched gem &#8208;difluorocyclopropanes showed substantial reduction of the enantiopurity, indicating cleavage of the distal C&#8208;C bond leading to the transient acyclic intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Difluoromethylations of Aryl Boronic Acids, Halides, and Pseudo Halides with Ex Situ Generated ICF2H</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An expedient ex situ generation of difluoroiodomethane (DFIM) and its immediate use in a Pd&#8208;catalyzed difluoromethylation of aryl boronic acids and ester derivatives applying a two&#8208;chamber reac&#173;tor is reported. Heating a solution of bromodifluoroacetic acid with sodium iodide in sulfolane proved to be effective for generation of near stoichiometric amounts of DFIM for the ensuing catalytic coupling step. A two&#8208;step difluoromethylation of aryl (pseudo)halides employing tetrahydroxydiboron as a low&#8208;cost reducing agent, and both promoted by Pd&#8208;catalysis, proved effective for installment of this fluorine&#8208;containing C  1  &#8208;group to several pharmaceutically relevant molecules. Finally, the method proved adaptable to deuterium incorporation by simply adding D  2  O to the DFIM generating chamber.</dc:description>

         <title>A Mesoionic Diselenolene Anion and the Corresponding Radical Dianion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dichalcogenolenes are archetypal redox non&#8208;innocent ligands with numerous applications. Herein, we describe a diselenolene ligand with fundamentally different electronic properties. By selenation of a C2&#8208;protected imidazolium salt, we have prepared a mesoionic diselenolene. This ligand is diamagnetic, which is in contrast to the paramagnetic nature of standard dichalcogenolene monoanions. The new ligand is also redox&#8208;active, as demonstrated by isolation of a stable diselenolene radical dianion. The unique electronic properties of the new ligand give rise to unusual coordination chemistry. Thus, we were able to prepare a hexa&#8208;coordinate aluminum tris(diselenolene) complex, and a Lewis acidic aluminate complex with two ligand&#8208;centered unpaired electrons.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivity of Diphenylberyllium as a Br&#248;nsted Base and its Synthetic Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diphenylberyllium [Be3Ph6] is here shown to react cleanly as a Br&#248;nsted base, with a vast variety of protic compounds. Through the addition of the simple molecules tBuOH, HNPh2, HPPh2, and the more complex 1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolinium chloride, protonation of one or two phenyl groups in diphenylberyllium was achieved. Resultantly, the long&#8208;postulated structures of [Be3(OtBu)6] and [Be(&#181;&#8208;NPh2)Ph]2 are finally verified and shown to be static in solution. Only the second beryllium&#8208;phosphanide structure is also prepared, with stark differences to analogous amine behaviour also examined. The first crystalline example of a beryllium Grignard reagent with a non&#8208;bulky aryl group has also been prepared, which is stabilized with an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene.</dc:description>

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Modification of Aminoglycoside Antibiotics Overcomes Bacterial Resistance Mediated by APH(3&#8217;) Kinases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The continuous emergence of antimicrobial resistance is causing a threat to patients infected by multidrug&#8208;resistant pathogens. In particular, the clinical use of aminoglycoside antibiotics, broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterials of last resort, is limited due to rising bacterial resistance. One of the major resistance mechanisms in Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria is phosphorylation of these amino sugars at the 3&#8217;&#8208;position by  O  &#8208;phosphotransferases [APH(3&#8217;)s]. Structural alteration of these antibiotics at the 3&#8217;&#8208;position would be an obvious strategy to tackle this resistance mechanism. However, the access to such derivatives requires cumbersome multi&#8208;step synthesis, which is not appealing for pharma industry in this low&#8208;return&#8208;on&#8208;investment market. To overcome this obstacle and combat bacterial resistance mediated by APH(3&#8217;)s, we introduce a novel regioselective modification of aminoglycosides in the 3&#8217;&#8208;position  via  palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidation. To underline the effectiveness of our method for structural modification of aminoglycosides, we have developed two novel antibiotic candidates overcoming APH(3&#8217;)s&#8208;mediated resistance employing only four synthetic steps.</dc:description>

To underline the effectiveness of our method for structural modification of aminoglycosides, we have developed two novel antibiotic candidates overcoming APH(3&#8217;)s-mediated resistance employing only four synthetic steps.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Promoted Rh(I)&#8208;Catalyzed C2&#8208;Selective C&#8210;H Alkenylation and Polyenylation of Imidazoles with Alkenyl Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first Rh(I)&#8208;catalyzed directed decarbonylative C2&#8210;H alkenylation of imidazoles with readily available alkenyl carboxylic acids is reported. The reaction proceeds in a highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective manner, providing efficient access to C2&#8208;alkenylated imidazoles that are generally inaccessible by known C&#8210;H alkenylation methods. This transformation accommodates a wide range of alkenyl carboxylic acids, including challenging conjugated polyene carboxylic acids, and diversely decorated imidazoles with high functional group compatibility. The presence of a removable pyrimidine directing group, and the use of a bidentate phosphine ligand are pivotal to the success of the catalytic reaction. In addition to imidazoles, this process is also suitable for benzimidazoles. Importantly, the scalability as well as diversification of the products highlight the potential of this protocol in practical applications. Detailed experimental and computational studies provide important insights into the underlying reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Photochemical Olefin Isomerization of Unsaturated Ketones via 1,5&#8208;Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bring on the Light: An efficient photochemical metal/catalyst&#8208;free system has been uncovered for the selective one&#8208;bond olefin migration of unsaturated ketones. Diverse substrate scope, functional group tolerance and its application for dehomologation and one&#8208;carbon selective olefin migration processes in linear alkenes highlights the usefulness of this method.







Abstract
The photochemical isomerization of &#945;,&#946;&#8208; to &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones through a 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer mechanism under mild conditions with high efficiency and selectivity is reported. The reaction is carried out in the absence of metal catalysts or other additives, and its stereoselectivity can be tuned by selecting appropriate solvent mixtures. The reaction&#8216;s scope and tolerance towards functional groups, including light&#8208;sensitive halogens, free acids and alcohols, were studied, providing reliable access to a wide variety of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. This methodology details the deconjugation of a wide range of unsaturated ketones and, when combined with olefin metathesis, provides an efficient process for either dehomologation or one&#8208;carbon double&#8208;bond migration of terminal alkenes.

         <title>A Terphenyl Supported Dioxophosphorane Dimer: the Light Congener of Lawesson's and Woollins&#8217; Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridines have been shown to mediate the release of ethene from a terphenyl supported 1,3&#8208;dioxo&#8208;2&#8208;phospholane. This generates a dioxophosphorane dimer which is an oxygen analogue of Lawesson's and Woollins&#8217; reagents. This compound was structurally characterised and its solution behaviour interrogated. Insight into the ethene release reaction is provided by the isolation of a DMAP&#8208;coordinated dioxophosphorane







Abstract
Thermolysis of a 1,3&#8208;dioxa&#8208;2&#8208;phospholane supported by the terphenyl ligand AriPr4 (AriPr4=[C6H3&#8208;2,6&#8208;(C6H3&#8208;2,6&#8208;iPr2)]) at 150&#8201;&#176;C gives [AriPr4PO2]2 via loss of ethene. [AriPr4PO2]2 was characterised by X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy; it contains a 4&#8208;membered P&#8722;O&#8722;P&#8722;O ring and is the isostructural oxygen analogue of Lawesson's and Woollins&#8217; reagents. The dimeric structure of [AriPr4PO2]2 was found to persist in solution through VT&#8197;NMR spectroscopy and DOSY, supported by DFT calculations. The addition of DMAP to the 1,3&#8208;dioxa&#8208;2&#8208;phospholane facilitates the loss of ethene to give AriPr4(DMAP)PO2 after days at room temperature, with this product also characterised by X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. Replacement of the DMAP with pyridine induces ethene loss from the 1,3&#8208;dioxa&#8208;2&#8208;phospholane to provide gram&#8208;scale samples of [AriPr4PO2]2 in 75&#8201;% yield in 2&#8197;days at only 100&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature Quantum Tunneling and Hydrogen Bonding Rearrangements Characterize the Solid&#8208;Solid Phase Transitions in a Phosphonium&#8208;Based Protic Ionic Liquid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tunneling driven dynamics for the PD3 group of the octyl phosphonium cation in an ionic liquid has been observed by means of solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. Deuteron line&#8208;shape analysis and relaxation time measurements provide information about the structure, mobility and rearrangements of the cations in the solid, supercooled and liquid states. Hydrogen bonds of different strengths allow the change in molecular ordering upon phase transformation to be mapped. More information can be found in the Research Article by D.&#8197;I. Kolokolov, R. Ludwig et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200257). The illustrations of the tunnel are used with the kind support of NOCH GmbH &amp; Co. KG, who owns the copyright.

         <title>Isopropenyl esters (iPEs) in green organic synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The need for greener compounds able to replace conventional ones with similar reactivity is crucial for the development of sustainable chemistry. Isopropenyl esters (iPEs) represent one eco&#8208;friendly alternative to acyl halides and anhydrides. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the preparation methodologies and reported synthetic applications of iPEs and, in particular, of isopropenyl acetate (iPAc). Intriguingly, the presence of a C=C double bond adjacent to the ester functionality makes iPEs appealing in different chemoselective organic synthesis transformations. For instance, the acyl moiety is suitable for transesterification reactions in presence of different heteroatom&#8208;based nucleophiles (  C  &#8208;,  O  &#8208;,  N  &#8208;,  S  &#8208;,  Se  &#8208;); these reactions are irreversible thanks to the formation of acetone, obtained upon keto&#8208;enol tautomerization of the prop&#8208;1&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;ol (isopropenyl) leaving group. Similarly, the unsaturation contained in the isopropenyl synthon could be selectively exploited in organic synthesis for electrophilic and/or radical additions as well as in metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. To conclude, iPEs recently found major interest in the direct modification of biomass (  i.e.  lignin or cellulose) and in the implementation of tandem reactions of esterification&#8208;acetalization by exploiting the co&#8208;formation of acetone during the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced cycling performance of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;S battery enabled by PVP&#8208;blended PEO&#8208;based double&#8208;layer electrolyte</title>

         <dc:description>Despite the high specific capacity of Li&#8208;S battery, shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and safety issue pose a great challenge to realize its commercial application. Replacing liquid electrolyte with poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) &#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolyte is considered as a promising method to boost the safety, but the shuttle effect of LiPSs cannot be completely eliminated. In this work, a new kind of double&#8208;layer PEO&#8208;based polymer electrolyte is designed to restrict the LiPSs. The layer next to cathode consists of PEO and poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP). The other layer consists of PEO. PVP with abundant of amide groups are electron&#8208;rich groups that have been proved to have strong affinity to LiPSs. The strong interaction between LiPSs and carbonyl groups in amide is verified by Attenuated Total Reflection&#8208;Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy tests. As a result, the assembled Li&#8208;S battery exhibits a specific capacity of 1100 mAh g  &#8208;1  &#160;and capacity retention of 347 mAh g  &#8208;1  &#160;after 200 cycles at 60&#176;C&#160;and 0.05&#160;C, while the capacity retention of the battery without PVP&#8208;blended PEO electrolyte remains only 27% at the same conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Deposition of vertically aligned Ag/Ag2S nanoflakes on EGaIn particles for humidity sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liquid metals, which possess both good electrical conductivity and liquid&#8208;like processability, have drawn much attention recently. They are also capable of acting as synthesis templates to guide the deposition of other functional materials. Herein, through an in&#8208;situ galvanic replacement reaction assisted by ultrasonication, core&#8208;shell EGaIn/Ag particles composed of EGaIn cores and vertically aligned Ag nanoflakes as shells were prepared, which were further sulfurized to yield ternary EGaIn/Ag/Ag  2  S core&#8208;shell composite particles. The humidity sensor based on EGaIn/Ag/Ag  2  S particles showed much higher sensing response as compared to EGaIn and EGaIn/Ag. Such superior performance could be attributed to the n&#8208;type semiconducting character of Ag  2  S to receive electrons from water molecules at low humidity, and its highly hydrophilic surface to absorb more water molecules at higher humidity to enable the formation of ion&#8208;conductive paths.</dc:description>

         <title>Unexpected Acid&#8208;Triggered Formation of Reversibly Photoswitchable Stenhouse Salts from Donor&#8208;Acceptor Stenhouse Adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In acidic conditions, the end&#8208;groups of water&#8208;soluble donor&#8208;acceptor Stenhouse adducts exhibit an unexpected fast scrambling, which generates attractive reversibly photoswitchable Stenhouse salts.







Abstract
Donor&#8208;acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASAs) are reversibly photoswitchable dyes, which are able to interconvert between a red/NIR absorbing triene&#8208;like state and a colorless cyclic state. Although optically attractive for multiple applications, their low solubility and lack of photoswitching in water impede their use in aqueous environments. We developed water&#8208;soluble DASAs based on indoline as donor and methyl, or trifluoromethyl, pyrazolone&#8208;based acceptors. In acetonitrile, photophysical analysis and photochemical studies, accounted with a three&#8208;state kinetic model, confirmed the reversible photoswitching mechanism previously proposed. In water, the colorless cyclic state is a thermodynamic sink at neutral pH values. In contrast, in acidic conditions, we observed a fast scrambling of DASAs&#8217; end&#8208;group resulting in the in&#8197;situ formation of Stenhouse salts (StS), which are in turn capable of reversible photoswitching. We believe that this unexpected result is of interest not only for the future design of DASAs with improved stability, but also for further development and applications of StS as photoswitchable probes.

         <title>Sulfonyl Nitrene and Amidyl Radical: Structure and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemical activation of sulfonyl azides leads to generation of reactive radicals that activate aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds. This study compares intrinsic reactivities of triplet sulfonyl nitrene, sulfonyl amidyl radicals and sulfonyl nitrene radical anions in the gas phase towards a series of hydrocarbons and correlates it to their structures investigated by ion spectroscopy. The most reactive triplet nitrene abstracts a hydrogen atom from ethane.







Abstract
Photocatalytic generation of nitrenes and radicals can be used to tune or even control their reactivity. Photocatalytic activation of sulfonyl azides leads to the elimination of N2 and the resulting reactive species initiate C&#8722;H activations and amide formation reactions. Here, we present reactive radicals that are generated from sulfonyl azides: sulfonyl nitrene radical anion, sulfonyl nitrene and sulfonyl amidyl radical, and test their gas phase reactivity in C&#8722;H activation reactions. The sulfonyl nitrene radical anion is the least reactive and its reactivity is governed by the proton coupled electron transfer mechanism. In contrast, sulfonyl nitrene and sulfonyl amidyl radicals react via hydrogen atom transfer pathways. These reactivities and detailed characterization of the radicals with vibrational spectroscopy and with DFT calculations provide information necessary for taking control over the reactivity of these intermediates.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Metathesis of an Ionic Liquid on Ag(111)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Schematic illustration of the surface preparation: 0.5&#8197;ML [dema][TfO] and 1.0&#8197;ML [C8C1Im][PF6] were sequentially deposited on Ag(111) at 90&#8197;K. Subsequently, the sample was heated to 500&#8197;K, which leads to the selective desorption of [dema][PF6] and [C8C1Im][PF6] at &#8764;235 and &#8764;380&#8197;K, respectively. Hereby, the new IL [C8C1Im][TfO] is formed by on&#8208;surface metathesis at the IL/metal interface, which then completely desorbs at &#8764;480&#8197;K.







Abstract
We investigated the adsorption, surface enrichment, ion exchange, and on&#8208;surface metathesis of ultrathin mixed IL films on Ag(111). We stepwise deposited 0.5&#8197;ML of the protic IL diethylmethylammonium trifluoromethanesulfonate ([dema][TfO]) and 1.0&#8197;ML of the aprotic IL 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;octylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([C8C1Im][PF6]) at around 90&#8197;K. Thereafter, the resulting layered frozen film was heated to 550&#8197;K, and the thermally induced phenomena were monitored in&#8197;situ by angle&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Between 135 and 200&#8197;K, [TfO]&#8722; anions at the Ag(111) surface are exchanged by [PF6]&#8722; anions and enriched together with [C8C1Im]+ cations at the IL/vacuum interface. Upon further heating, [dema][PF6] and [OMIm][PF6] desorb selectively at &#8764;235 and &#8764;380&#8197;K, respectively. Hereby, a wetting layer of pure [C8C1Im][TfO] is formed by on&#8208;surface metathesis at the IL/metal interface, which completely desorbs at &#8764;480&#8197;K. For comparison, ion enrichment at the vacuum/IL interface was also studied in macroscopic IL mixtures, where no influence of the solid support is expected.

         <title>Taming of the DIBAL Promoted Debenzylation of &#945;&#8208;Cyclodextrin. Kinetics, Substituent Effects and Efficient Synthesis of Lings Tetrol**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the kinetics of a reaction is important if one wish to control it. It was realized that diisobutylaluminium hydride (DIBAL) promoted debenzylation of the secondary alcohols in 2A&#8211;F,3A&#8211;F,6B,C,E,F&#8208;hexadecabenzyl &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (4) was zero order in DIBAL and most likely following an intramolecular mechanism. Using this information, 2A&#8211;F,3B,C,E,F,6B,C,E,F&#8208;tetradecabenzyl &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (Lings tetrol), an extremely useful building block, could be formed as sole product and in good yield by conducting the reaction at low DIBAL concentration.







Abstract
The kinetics of the reaction of perbenzyl &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin was studied varying the concentration of DIBAL and substrate, and the temperature. The initial debenzylation was found to be 1st order in substrate and follow the relationship 0.0675+0.179[DIBAL]2 with respect to the concentration of DIBAL. The second and the third debenzylation which led to the 3A,6A,6D&#8208;triol (Lings triol) were both found to be 1st order in substrate concentration and zero order in DIBAL concentration. Longer reaction times with DIBAL in high concentration gave further debenzylation to comparatively complex mixtures containing the 2B,3A,6A,6D&#8208;tetrol and the 3A,6A,6C,6D&#8208;tetrol. In contrast reaction at 0.1&#8197;M DIBAL gave the symmetrical 3A,6A,3D,6D&#8208;tetrol (Lings tetrol) in 60&#8201;% yield. The effect of chlorine or methyl substitution of the phenyl groups of perbenzyl &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin was also investigated. Per 4&#8208;chlorobenzyl slowed down the reaction with DIBAL, while 4&#8208;methylbenzyl increased the reaction rate, but still gave the corresponding 6&#8197;A&#8208;monool or 6A,6D&#8208;diol products. A Hammett reaction constant of &#8722;4.9 was found for the first debenzylation showing a high degree of positive charge in the transition state. The per(2,4&#8208;dichlorobenzyl)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;derivative was completely resistant to DIBAL, however upon addition of trimethyl aluminium this derivative also reacted to give the 6A,6D&#8208;diol product.

         <title>A Tale of Two Complexes: Electro&#8208;Assisted Oxidation of Thioanisole by an &#8220;O2 Activator/Oxidizing Species&#8221; Tandem System of Non&#8208;Heme Iron Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electro&#8208;assisted oxidation of thioanisole by O2 was achieved using a tandem couple &#8220;O2 activator/oxidation system&#8221; of non&#8208;heme complexes: at an electrode, L2FeIII(OTf) is reduced to FeII, which activates O2 to superoxide and transfers it to (TPEN)FeII(PF6). The latter generates a reactive species capable of substrate oxygenation.







Abstract
We report two new FeIII complexes [L1FeIII(H2O)](OTf)2 and [L2FeIII(OTf)], obtained by replacing pyridines by phenolates in a known non&#8208;heme aminopyridine iron complex. While the original, starting aminopyridine [(L52)FeII(MeCN)](PF6) complex is stable in air, the potentials of the new FeIII/II couples decrease to the point that [L2FeII] spontaneously reduces O2 to superoxide. We used it as an O2 activator in an electrochemical setup, as its presence allows to generate superoxide at a much more accessible potential (&gt;500&#8197;mV gain). Our aim was to achieve substrate oxidation via the reductive activation of O2. While L2FeIII(OTf) proved to be a good O2 activator but a poor oxidation system, its association with another complex (TPEN)FeII(PF6)2 generates a complementary tandem couple for electro&#8208;assisted oxidation of substrates, working at a very accessible potential: upon reduction, L2FeIII(OTf) activates O2 to superoxide and transfers it to (TPEN)FeII(PF6)2 leading in fine to the oxidation of thioanisole.

         <title>Hydroxy Groups Enhance [2]Rotaxane Anion Binding Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new rotaxanes were synthesized containing phenolic O&#8208;H groups on the axle component. These O&#8208;H groups hydrogen bond to the macrocycle component, rigidifying the binding pocket and resulting in significantly enhanced selectivity for chloride anions over more basic oxoanions.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of two [2]rotaxanes containing an interlocked three dimensional binding cavity formed from a pyridinium bis(amide) axle component containing two phenol donors, and an isophthalamide based macrocycle. In the competitive solvent mixture 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 CDCl3&#8201;:&#8201;CD3OD, one of the receptors exhibits a much higher selectivity preference for chloride than an analogous rotaxane without the hydroxy groups. X&#8208;ray crystal structures reveal the chloride anion guest encapsulated within the interlocked binding cavity, though not all of the hydrogen bond donors are utilised. Computational semi&#8208;empirical simulations indicate that secondary intermolecular interactions occur between the axle hydroxy hydrogen bond donors and the [2]rotaxane macrocycle components, contributing to a more preorganised binding pocket, which may be responsible for the observed enhanced selectivity.

         <title>Photoswitching Affinity and Mechanism of Multivalent Lectin Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An arylazopyrazole&#8208;containing divalent ligand was tailored to control multivalent binding to the model lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) by light irradiation. The ligand was designed in such a way that only the E isomer is able to bridge adjacent binding sites of WGA. The two photoisomers show an unprecedentedly high change in binding affinity, as determined by isothermal titration calorimetry and different binding modes (chelating binding for the E isomer and crosslinking binding for the Z isomer).







Abstract
Multivalent receptor&#8211;ligand binding is a key principle in a plethora of biological recognition processes. Immense binding affinities can be achieved with the correct spatial orientation of the ligands. Accordingly, the incorporation of photoswitches, which can be used to reversibly change the spatial orientation of molecules, into multivalent ligands is a means to alter the binding affinity and possibly also the binding mode of such ligands. We report a divalent ligand for the model lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) containing an arylazopyrazole photoswitch. This switch, which has recently been introduced as an alternative to the more commonly used azobenzene moiety, is characterized by almost quantitative E/Z photoswitching in both directions, high quantum yields, and high thermal stability of the Z isomer. The ligand was designed in a way that only one of the isomers is able to bridge adjacent binding sites of WGA leading to a chelating binding mode. Photoswitching induces an unprecedentedly high change in lectin binding affinity as determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Furthermore, additional dynamic light scattering (DLS) data suggest that the binding mode of the ligand changes from chelating binding of the E isomer to crosslinking binding of the Z isomer.

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution over Ce&#8208;Co9S8 Core&#8208;shell Nanoneedle Arrays via Electronic and Architectural Dual Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electronic and architecture dual engineering strategy is a considerable way to rationally design earth&#8208;abundant and highly&#8208;efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts for sustainable hydrogen&#8208;based energy devices. Herein, a carbon cloth supported Ce&#8208;doped Co9S8 core&#8208;shell nanoneedle array (Ce&#8208;Co9S8@CC) is designed and developed for accelerating the sluggish kinetics of OER. Profited by valance alternative Ce doping, well&#8208;fined core&#8208;shell structure and vertically aligned nanoneedle arrayed architecture, the resultant Ce&#8208;Co9S8@CC integrates modulated electronic structure, highly&#8208;exposed active sites and multidimensional mass diffusion channels, which collaboratively afford for the favorable OER catalytic process. The resultant Ce&#8208;Co9S8@CC exhibits remarkable OER performance in an alkaline medium, where the overpotential requires only 242 mV to deliver the current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2 for the OER, which is 70 mV superior to that of Ce&#8208;free Co9S8 catalyst and other counterparts. The robust stability and impressive selectivity (nearly 100 % Faradic efficiency) are also demonstrated. When integrating in a two&#8208;electrode OER//HER electrolyzer, the as&#8208;prepared Ce&#8208;Co9S8@CC displays a low operation potential of 1.54 V at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 and distinguished long&#8208;term stability, demonstrating great potential for economical water electrolysis.</dc:description>

         <title>pH switchable water dispersed photocatalytic nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photogeneration of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) finds applications in fields as different as nanomedicine, art preservation, air and water depollution and surface decontamination. Here we present photocatalytic nanoparticles (NP) that are active only at acidic pH while they do not show relevant ROS photo&#8208;generation at neutral pH. This dual responsivity (to light and pH) is achieved by stabilizing the surface of TiO  2  NP with a specific organic shell during the synthesis and it is peculiar of the achieved core shell&#8208;structure, as demonstrated by comparison with commercial photocatalytic TiO  2  NP. For the investigation of the photocatalytic activity we developed two methods that allow real time detection of the process preventing any kind of artifact arising from post&#8208;treatments and delayed analysis. The reversibility of the pH response was also demonstrated as well as the selective photo&#8208;killing of cancer cells at acidic pH.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescent Surface&#8208;Tethered Polymer Brush Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new key: The incorporation of luminescence into surface&#8208;tethered polymer brushes is discussed in this review. It unlocks new characterization techniques and has been used for a wide range of applications including sensors, cellular labelling, optoelectronics and stenography. These materials can demonstrate enhanced stability compared to physisorbed polymer films or luminescent dyes, and offer improved control over both the composition of thin films and their spatial arrangement.







Abstract
Surface&#8208;tethered polymers are unique molecular architectures that have been recently used in advanced sensors, electronics and biomedical applications. However, techniques for characterizing these materials in their surface&#8208;tethered form remain limited. The incorporation of luminescent functionality into these materials has enabled new characterization methods, while also unlocking new applications in optoelectronics, stenography and sensing. Micron&#8208;scale photolithography techniques have recently enabled the preparation of high&#8208;resolution patterns, as well as architectures with unique photophysical properties. Herein, we provide an overview of the techniques used to prepare luminescent polymer brush materials and their applications in stimuli&#8208;responsive sensors, cell adhesion materials, and optoelectronics. We also provide our perspective on the promising future uses of surface&#8208;tethered polymers, as well as the short&#8208;term challenges and opportunities in the field.

         <title>Deciphering the Spectral Tuning Mechanism in Proteorhodopsin: The Dominant Role of Electrostatics Instead of Chromophore Geometry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
There are two phenotypes of proteorhodopsin exhibiting an environmental adaption to the ocean's depth. These are blue&#8208;absorbing proteorhodopsin (BPR) and green&#8208;absorbing proteorhodopsin (GPR). The key to the blue/green shift between these variants originates from position 105, where BPR contains a glutamine (Q) and GPR a leucine (L). In this work it was found that Q105 is responsible for generating a positive electrostatic potential near the retinal chromophore leading to the observed blue&#8208;shift in BPR.







Abstract
Proteorhodopsin (PR) is a photoactive proton pump found in marine bacteria. There are two phenotypes of PR exhibiting an environmental adaptation to the ocean's depth which tunes their maximum absorption: blue&#8208;absorbing proteorhodopsin (BPR) and green&#8208;absorbing proteorhodopsin (GPR). This blue/green color&#8208;shift is controlled by a glutamine to leucine substitution at position 105 which accounts for a 20&#8197;nm shift. Typically, spectral tuning in rhodopsins is rationalized by the external point charge model but the Q105L mutation is charge neutral. To study this tuning mechanism, we employed the hybrid QM/MM method with sampling from molecular dynamics. Our results reveal that the positive partial charge of glutamine near the C14&#8722;C15 bond of retinal shortens the effective conjugation length of the chromophore compared to the leucine residue. The derived mechanism can be applied to explain the color regulation in other retinal proteins and can serve as a guideline for rational design of spectral shifts.

There are two phenotypes of PR exhibiting an environmental adaptation to the ocean's depth which tunes their maximum absorption: blue-absorbing proteorhodopsin (BPR) and green-absorbing proteorhodopsin (GPR). This blue/green color-shift is controlled by a glutamine to leucine substitution at position 105 which accounts for a 20&#8197;nm shift. Typically, spectral tuning in rhodopsins is rationalized by the external point charge model but the Q105L mutation is charge neutral. To study this tuning mechanism, we employed the hybrid QM/MM method with sampling from molecular dynamics. Our results reveal that the positive partial charge of glutamine near the C&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt; bond of retinal shortens the effective conjugation length of the chromophore compared to the leucine residue. The derived mechanism can be applied to explain the color regulation in other retinal proteins and can serve as a guideline for rational design of spectral shifts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A cage&#8208;based MOF (Ni&#8208;NKU&#8208;101) was synthesized with biphenyl&#8208;3,3&#8217;,5,5&#8217;&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid. Ni&#8208;NKU&#8208;101 contains two types of cages based on nickel&#8208;clusters to form a 3D framework. A series of isostructural bimetallic MxNi1&#8208;x&#8208;NKU&#8208;101 were synthesized and studied for the electrochemical HER. Among them, the bimetallic CuxNi1&#8208;x&#8208;NKU&#8208;101 family exhibit improved electrocatalytic HER performance in 0.5&#8197;M sulfuric acid electrolyte, owing to the synergistic effect of the Cu/Ni bimetallic centers.







Abstract
A cage&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Ni&#8208;NKU&#8208;101) with biphenyl&#8208;3,3&#8217;,5,5&#8217;&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid was synthesized via solvothermal method. Ni&#8208;NKU&#8208;101 contains two types of cages based on trinuclear and octa&#8208;nuclear nickel&#8208;clusters that are connected with each other by the 4&#8208;connected ligands, to form a 3D framework with a new topology. A mixed&#8208;metal strategy was used to synthesize isostructural bimetallic MOFs of MxNi1&#8208;x&#8208;NKU&#8208;101 (M=Mn, Co, Cu, Zn). The electrocatalytic studies showed that the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of CuxNi1&#8208;x&#8208;NKU&#8208;101 is much higher than that of other MxNi1&#8208;x&#8208;NKU&#8208;101 catalysts in acidic aqueous solution, owing to the synergistic effect of the bimetallic centers. The optimized Cu0.19Ni0.81&#8208;NKU&#8208;101 has an overpotential of 324&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 131&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1. The mechanism of HER activity over these bimetallic MOF&#8208;based electrocatalysts are discussed in detail.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Red Emissive Squaraine&#8208;AIEgen in Elastomer Enabling High Contrast and Fast Thermoresponse for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting and Temperature Sensing**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new red&#8208;emissive squaraine&#8208;based AIEgen is designed for high performance thermoresponsive materials. Molecularly dispersing the AIEgen into an elastomer&#8208;like poly(styrene&#8208;co&#8208;butadiene) (SBR) is shown to significantly improve both the contrast ratio and response time of the resulting thermoresponsive film, making it quite suitable for anti&#8208;counterfeiting and temperature sensing.







Abstract
Two challenges remain for organic thermoresponsive materials; one is to develop high&#8208;performance red&#8208;emissive thermoresponsive materials, while another is to simultaneously achieve high contrast ratio (CR), fast and reversible thermoresponse in a single element. Herein, we not only develop a new deep&#8208;red emissive squaraine&#8208;based AIEgen (TPE&#8208;SQ12) based on a pyrylium end group, which is suitable for fabricating high&#8208;performance thermoresponsive materials, but also show an effective approach to improve both CR (&#8764;ten times increase) and response time (less than 3 seconds), that is, molecularly dispersing AIEgen into an elastomer, attributed to the significantly expanded free volume of elastomer upon increasing the temperature that can activate the AIEgen intramolecular movements more pronouncedly. Double encryption and temperature mapping systems have been separately established by using our designed elastomer/TPE&#8208;SQ12 film, showing the great potential for anti&#8208;counterfeiting and temperature sensing. Finally, white emission is further achieved by co&#8208;doping TPE&#8208;SQ12 with cyan dye into elastomer, which enables fluorescent thermochromism for improving the temperature mapping ability.

         <title>A Photoresponsive Receptor with a 105 Magnitude of Reversible Anion&#8208;Binding Switching</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient anion receptor with photoswitchable functionality based on a new photoresponsive chromophore is introduced. Upon photoirradiation with UV light, (E,E)&#8208;2&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;diiminoguanidinium displays a switched&#8208;off change in binding strength towards sulfate of more than five orders of magnitude. In DMSO, the open E,E form binds sulfate with extraordinary strength through chelating guanidinium hydrogen bonds. Upon photoisomerization to the Z,Z isomer, the anion&#8208;binding site is shut off by intramolecular hydrogen bonds to the 2&#8208;pyridyl substituents, thereby releasing the bound sulfate.







Abstract
In a leap toward anion separation that uses only energy input for binding and release cycles, we report herein a new class of photoswitchable anion receptors featuring a diiminoguanidinium functionality that displays a change of more than five orders of magnitude in switched&#8208;off binding strength towards sulfate, a representative oxyanion, upon photoirradiation with UV light. The (E,E)&#8208;2&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;diiminoguanidinium cation, synthesized as the triflate salt, binds sulfate with extraordinary strength in [D6]DMSO owing to its bidentate guanidinium hydrogen bonding, which can chelate the O&#8722;S&#8722;O edge of sulfate. Upon photoisomerization to the Z,Z isomer, the anion&#8208;binding site is essentially shut off by intramolecular hydrogen bonds to the 2&#8208;pyridyl substituents, as shown by anion&#8208;binding titrations, theoretical calculations, and X&#8208;ray structural analysis. This approach will allow the development of advanced anion&#8208;separation cycles that use only energy input and generate no chemical waste, and thus address challenging chemical separation problems in a more sustainable way.

         <title>Ultrafast Electrochemical Capacitors with Carbon Related Materials as Electrodes for AC Line Filtering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;related electrode materials have been widely demonstrated to significantly increase the performance of electrochemical capacitors because of their light weight, high strength and high processability. The preparation method and structure design of carbon&#8208;related electrode materials are very important to the performance of capacitors.







Abstract
High&#8208;frequency responsive electrochemical capacitors (ECs), which can directly convert alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC), are getting more essential for the rapid development of electronic devices. In order to satisfy the requirements of ECs with fast rate capability and appreciable capacitance density, numerous efforts have been made towards the preparation and design of the electrode material, which is a decisive factor in the performance of ECs. Carbon&#8208;related electrode materials have been widely shown to significantly increase the performance of ECs because of their light weight, high strength, and high processability. In this concept, the latest advances in the rational design and controllable fabrication of carbon&#8208;related electrode materials, including planar 2D materials, random 3D, and vertical carbon materials are summarized. Moreover, the state of the art of carbon&#8208;based ECs is discussed from the viewpoint of the structure of the electrode and performance of ECs. Finally, this concept presents integrated perspectives on the further design and preparation of carbon related ECs.

         <title>Transition Metal Doping Induces Ti3+ to Promote the Performance of SrTiO3@TiO2 Visible Light Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to Prepare C1 Product.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe, Co, Ni, Cu&#8208;doped SrTiO3@TiO2 (strontium titanate&#8208;rich titanate) was prepared by a simple and environmentally friendly hydrothermal method. The photoresponse range of SrTiO3@TiO2 material is broadened to the visible region. The Ti3+ induced by the charge compensation effect greatly promotes the photoelectron&#8208;hole separation, which in turn promotes the ability of the catalyst to reduce CO2 to produce C1 products in water.







Abstract
Transition metal Fe, Co, Ni and Cu doped strontium titanate&#8208;rich SrTiO3@TiO2 (STO@T) materials were prepared by hydrothermal method. The prepared doped materials exhibit better photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CH4 ability under visible light conditions. Among them, Fe&#8208;doped and undoped SrTiO3@TiO2 under visible light conditions CO2 reduction products only CO, while M&#8208;STO@T (M=Co, Ni, Cu) samples converted CO2 to CH4. The average methane yield of Ni&#8208;doped STO@T samples are as high as 73.85&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. The production of methane is mainly due to the increase in the response of the doped samples to visible light. And the increase in the separation rate of photogenerated electrons and holes and the efficiency of electron transport caused by the generation of impurity levels. The impurity level caused by Ti3+ plays an important role in the production of methane by CO2 visible light reduction. Ni doping effectively improves the photocatalytic performance of STO@T and CO2 reduction mechanism were explained.

         <title>Photochemical Deracemization of a Medicinally&#8208;Relevant Benzopyran using an Oscillatory Flow Reactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;transformation: Unlike classical enantiomeric resolution methods, crystallization&#8208;induced diastereomer transformations (CIDTs) allow full conversion to the desired enantiomer. Using photochemical racemization for a CIDT has not before been published in the scientific literature. We report the use of an oscillatory flow reactor for efficient irradiation, allowing high yield and &gt;95&#8201;% ee to be achieved in a reaction time of just a few hours.







Abstract
Dynamic deracemization processes, such as crystallization&#8208;induced diastereomer transformations (CIDTs), offer the opportunity to combine racemization and resolution processes, to provide high yields of enantiomerically pure compounds. To date, few of these processes have incorporated photochemical racemization. By combining batch crystallization with a flow photoreactor for efficient irradiation, it is possible to perform such deracemization in an effective, scalable and high yielding manner. After applying design of experiment (DoE) principles and mathematical modelling, the most efficient parameter set could be identified, leading to excellent results in just 4&#8197;h reaction time: isolated yield of 82&#8201;% and assay ee of 96&#8201;%. Such photochemical racemization methods can serve to open new avenues for preparation of enantiomerically pure functional molecules on both small and industrially&#8208;relevant scales.

         <title>Characterization of Asx Turn Types and Their Connate Relationship with &#946;&#8208;Turns</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bridging the gap between crystallized proteins and gas&#8208;phase models sheds light on the structure and the function of Asx turns. A comparison of the isolated Asx turns, based on an asparagine residue, observed in model peptides by using laser spectroscopic and quantum chemistry diagnostics, with the structures of crystallized proteins supports the premise that Asx turns foster or stabilize classical &#946;&#8208;turn structures, and even promote &#946;&#8208;bulges when Asn is followed by a Gly residue.

         <title>Eco&#8208;conception of Highly Salt&#8208;Tolerant Alkyl Ether Carboxylate Hydrotropes with a Glyceryl Spacer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eco&#8208;compatible access to new alkyl ether carboxylates with a glyceryl spacer is described and their physicochemical properties are evaluated. The targeted application is a hydrotrope that can be use in numerous domains such as extraction, detergency and solubilisation. The interesting properties of these bio&#8208;based hydrotropes make them serious sustainable candidates for applications where high salinity is required.







Abstract
New alkyl ether carboxylates with a glyceryl spacer instead of ethylene glycol units have been synthesised using environmentally friendly methodology. A cascade synthesis of acetalisation and hydrogenolysis was developed to obtain products containing an alkyl chain linked to a glycerol unit bearing a polar carboxylate head. These products were methylated by using trimethyl phosphate to observe the influence of a free or methoxylated alcohol on the physicochemical properties. Finally, saponification gave the carboxylate anionic group of the new hydrotropes. Studying the amphiphilicity, the tolerance to sodium and calcium ions, and the solubilising power of these bio&#8208;based ionic/nonionic hydrotropes has shown that they exhibit significantly improved application properties compared to similar petro&#8208;based hydrotropes.

         <dc:description>
The cover feature picture shows the successive expansion of a quinoid imidazolylidene&#8208;substituted central sulfur&#8208;containing heterocyclic core, which is accompanied by a continuous decrease in the HOMO/LUMO gap. This ultimately results in bench&#8208;stable, open&#8208;shell diradicals, as evidenced by the small singlet&#8208;triplet gap. More information can be found in the Research Article by J.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Formed Stable PbI2/NiOx Interface with Increased Ni3+ Centers for Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultraviolet ozone flushing (UVO) has been used to oxidize the NiOx hole&#8208;transport layer (yellow). The lattice bottom left shows the activation of Ni3+ (red balls) at the top of the NiOx film, which can enhance the electrical properties and hole extraction ability of NiOx. Then, by adopting sequential deposition of perovskites, residual PbI2 is automatically formed at the bottom interface (brown layer); this prevents the NiOx film from coming into direct contact with the perovskite layer, thus avoiding NiOx&#8208;related chemical reactions. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Yang, Y. Hou, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200202).

         <title>Elaborated Reaction Pathway of Photothermal Catalytic CO2 Conversion with H2O on Gallium Oxide&#8208;Decorated and &#8208;Defective Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The elaborate thermodynamic reaction pathways on Ga2O3&#8208;decorated and &#8208;defective surfaces during photothermal catalytic CO2 conversion with H2O have been established. The basic site generated by Ga2O3 decoration on an anatase TiO2 (101) surface enhances the selective adsorption of CO2, and also balances VO formation and CO2 reduction activity. Surface&#8208;defect VO promotes the reaction thermodynamics but tends to be consumed; Ga2O3 helps to keep VO active. Ga2O3 and VO together further decrease the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step, thereby promoting C1 production. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y.&#8208;W. Zhang et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104490).

         <dc:description>
Reviews are more important today than ever. With the glut of new publications, it has become increasing difficult to read all original papers in detail. So, scientists usually first get an overview from reviews. In the review on &#8220;Cyanine Dyes Containing Quinoline Moieties: History, Synthesis, Optical Properties and Applications&#8221; (Chem Eur. J. 2021, 27, 2430), some aspects were incorrectly described and discussed. This correspondence tries to clarify some basics that have been presented insufficiently in the review.

         <title>Formation and Photoinduced Electron Transfer in Porphyrin&#8208; and Phthalocyanine&#8208;Bearing N&#8208;Doped Graphene Hybrids Synthesized by Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heteroatom&#8208;doped graphene is emerging as an outstanding material for tailoring the properties of graphene by chemical functionalization. With the use of classical click chemistry, N&#8208;doped graphene has been functionalized to carry well&#8208;known photosensitizer electron donors, viz., zinc porphyrin and zinc phthalocyanine. Efficient singlet quenching of photosensitizers was witnessed in these hybrids, and the ultrafast pump&#8211;probe technique provided evidence of excited&#8208;state charge separation in these hybrids, thus making them useful candidates for applications in harvesting light energy. More information can be found in the Research Article by &#193;. Sastre&#8208;Santos, F. D'Souza, F. Langa et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200254).

         <title>A single bioinspired hexameric nickel catechol&#8208;alloxazine catalyst combines metal and radical mechanisms for alkene hydrosilylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanisms combining organic radicals and metallic intermediates hold strong potential in homogeneous catalysis. Such activation modes require careful optimization of two interconnected processes: one for the generation of radicals and one for their productive integration towards the final product. We report that a bioinspired polymetallic nickel complex can combine ligand&#8208; and metal&#8208;centered reactivities to perform fast hydrosilylation of alkenes under mild conditions through an unusual dual radical&#8208; and metalbased mechanism. This earth&#8208;abundant polymetallic complex incorporating a catechol&#8208;alloxazine motif as redox&#8208;active ligand operates at low catalyst loading (0.25 mol%) and generates silyl radicals and a nickel&#8208;hydride intermediate through a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) step. Evidence of an isomerization sequence enabling terminal hydrosilylation of internal alkenes points towards the involvement of the nickel&#8208;hydride species in chain walking. This single catalyst promotes a hybrid pathway by combining synergistically ligand and metal participation in both inner&#8208; and outer&#8208; sphere processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Reliable Functionalization of 5,6&#8208;Fused Bicyclic N&#8208;Heterocycles Pyrazolopyrimidines and Imidazopyridazines via Zinc and Magnesium Organometallics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DFT&#8208;calculations allow prediction of the reactivity of uncommon  N  &#8208;heterocyclic scaffolds of pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;  a  ]pyrimidines and imidazo[1,2&#8208;  b  ]pyridazines and considerably facilitate their functionalization. The derivatization of these  N  &#8208;heterocycles was realized using Grignard reagents for nucleophilic additions to 5&#8208;chloropyrazolo[1,5&#8208;  a  ]pyrimidines and TMP  2  Zn&#183;2MgCl  2  &#183;2LiCl allowed regioselective zincations. In the case of 6&#8208;chloroimidazo[1,2&#8208;  b  ]pyridazine, bases such as TMP  2  Zn&#183;MgCl  2  &#183;2LiCl, in the presence or absence of BF  3  &#183;OEt  2  , led to regioselective metalations at positions 3 or 8. Subsequent functionalizations were achieved with TMPMgCl&#183;LiCl, producing various polysubstituted derivatives (up to penta&#8208;substitution). X&#8208;ray analysis confirmed the regioselectivity for key functional heterocycles.</dc:description>

Subsequent functionalizations were achieved with TMPMgCl&#183;LiCl, producing various polysubstituted derivatives (up to penta-substitution). X-ray analysis confirmed the regioselectivity for key functional heterocycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Formation of a tetrameric heteropolyoxometalate ring of bismuth&#8208;containing lacunary phosphomolybdate clusters.







Abstract
A new hetero&#8208;bimetallic polyoxometalate (POM) nano&#8208;ring was synthesized in a one&#8208;pot procedure. The structure consists of tetrameric units containing four bismuth&#8208;substituted monolacunary Keggin anions including distorted [BiO8] cubes. The nano&#8208;ring is formed via self&#8208;assembly from metal precursors in aqueous acidic medium. The compound (NH4)16[(BiPMo11O39)4]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;22&#8201;H2O; (P4Bi4Mo44) was characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS), Raman spectroscopy, matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionisation&#8208;time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI&#8208;TOF), and thermogravimetry/differential scanning calorimetry mass spectrometry (TG&#8208;DSC&#8208;MS). The formation of the nano&#8208;ring in solution was studied by time&#8208;resolved in&#8197;situ small&#8208; and wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS) and in&#8197;situ EXAFS measurements at the Mo&#8722;K and the Bi&#8722;L3 edge indicating a two&#8208;step process consisting of condensation of Mo&#8208;anions and formation of Bi&#8722;Mo&#8208;units followed by a rapid self&#8208;assembly to yield the final tetrameric ring structure.

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding with Diaryl Ditellurides: Evidence from Solid State and Solution Studies.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diaryl ditelluride derivatives bearing different functional groups were prepared with the aim to study their ability to interact through chalcogen bonding (ChB). Rectangular Te4 and triangular Te3 motifs were observed in the solid&#8208;state as a result of intermolecular Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te ChB. In solution, the use of the very sensitive 125Te, 17O NMR analyses as well as 19F&#8722;1H HOESY allowed unambiguous detection of a Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O chalcogen bond between the diaryl ditellurides and phosphine oxides.







Abstract
The chalcogen bonding (ChB) ability of Te is studied in symmetrical diaryl ditellurides ArTeTeAr. Among the two Te &#963;&#8208;holes, the one along the less polarized Te&#8722;Te bond was calculated as the more electropositive. This counter&#8208;intuitive situation is due to the hyperconjugation contribution from Te lone pair to the &#963;* of the adjacent Te which coincides with &#963;&#8208;hole along the more polarized Te&#8722;Ar bond. ArTeTeAr showed notable structural features in the solid state as a result of intermolecular Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te ChB, such as a Te4 rectangle through dimer aggregation or a triangular Te3 motif, where one Te interacts with both Te atoms of a neighboring molecule through both its &#963;&#8208;hole and lone pair, in a slightly frustrated geometry. Lewis acidity of ArTeTeAr was also evaluated by NMR with R3PO as &#963;&#8208;hole acceptors in different solvents. Thus, 125Te NMR allowed monitoring Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interaction and delivering association constants (Ka) for 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 adducts. The highest value of Ka=90&#8197;M&#8722;1 was measured for the adduct between ArTeTeAr bearing CF3 groups and Et3PO in cyclohexane. Notably, by using nBu3PO, Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interaction was revealed by 19F&#8208;1H HOESY showing spatial proximity between CF3 and CH3 of nBu3PO.

         <title>Azide&#8211;Alkyne Interactions: A Crucial Attractive Force for Their Preorganization for Topochemical Cycloaddition Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A complete crystallographic, experimental and quantum&#8208;chemical investigation for novel azide&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;alkyne supramolecular contacts in molecular crystals has established the directing role of such favorable interactions in topochemical cycloaddition reactions. The origin, geometry, and energetics of azide&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;alkyne contacts have been extensively probed through topological analysis, a reduced density gradient method, electrostatic potential maps, and solid&#8208;state and gas&#8208;phase energy decomposition analysis. This new attractive interaction may be used in designing functional crystalline materials.







Abstract
A new class of attractive intermolecular interaction between azide and ethynyl structural entities in a wide range of molecular crystals is reported. This interaction was systematically evaluated by using 11 geometrically different structural motifs that are preorganized to direct a solid&#8208;state topochemical azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) reaction. The supramolecular features of the azide&#8211;alkyne interaction were mapped by various crystallographic and quantum chemical approaches. Topological analysis shows the noticeable participation of electron density in the azide&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;alkyne interactions. Interestingly, reorientation of the atomic polarizabilities in vicinal azide and alkyne groups upon interaction in crystals favors soft orbital&#8208;guided TAAC reactions. Moreover, various solid&#8208;state and gas&#8208;phase energy decomposition methods of individual azide&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;alkyne interactions summarize that the strength (varies from &#8722;5.7 to &#8722;30.1&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) is primarily guided by the dispersion forces with a influencing contribution from the electrostatics.

         <title>The Non&#8208;Ancillary Nature of Trimethylsilylamide Substituents in Boranes and Borinium Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of borinium cations were generated from boranes by fluoride extraction. The authors investigated the reaction mechanism using observational and density functional calculations and discuss how silyl&#8208;amide substituents in boranes and borinium cations are shown not to be ancillary substituents, but rather act as sources of protons, SiMe3 and methyl groups.







Abstract
The known boranes (R(Me3Si)N)2BF (R=Me3Si 1, tBu 2, C6F5 3, o&#8208;tol 4, Mes 5, Dipp 6) and borinium salts (R(Me3Si)N)2B][B(C6F5)4] (R=Me3Si 7, tBu 8) are prepared and fully characterized. Compound 7 is shown to react with phosphines to generate [R3PSiMe3]+ and [R3PH]+ (R=Me, tBu). Efforts to generate related borinium cations via fluoride abstraction from (R(Me3Si)N)2BF (R=C6F5 3, o&#8208;tol 4, Mes 5) gave complex mixtures suggesting multiple reaction pathways. However for R=Dipp 6, the species [(&#956;&#8208;F)(SiMe2N(Dipp))2BMe][B(C6F5)4] was isolated as the major product, indicating methyl abstraction from silicon and F/Me exchange on boron. These observations together with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art DFT mechanistic studies reveal that the trimethylsilyl&#8208;substituents do not behave as ancillary subsitutents but rather act as sources of proton, SiMe3 and methyl groups.

&lt;p&gt;The known boranes (R(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si)N)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BF (R=Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-tol &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;, Mes &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;, Dipp &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;) and borinium salts (R(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si)N)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B][B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] (R=Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu &lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt;) are prepared and fully characterized. Compound &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt; is shown to react with phosphines to generate [R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PSiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and [R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PH]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (R=Me, &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu). Efforts to generate related borinium cations via fluoride abstraction from (R(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si)N)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BF (R=C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;, o-tol &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;, Mes &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;) gave complex mixtures suggesting multiple reaction pathways. However for R=Dipp &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;, the species [(&#956;-F)(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N(Dipp))&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BMe][B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] was isolated as the major product, indicating methyl abstraction from silicon and F/Me exchange on boron. These observations together with state-of-the-art DFT mechanistic studies reveal that the trimethylsilyl-substituents do not behave as ancillary subsitutents but rather act as sources of proton, SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and methyl groups.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Allyl Uranium(IV) Sandwich Complex: Are &#981; Bonding Interactions Possible?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complexes of actinide species that employ the unique orbital structure of the f orbitals is still quite rare. We have used theory&#8208;directed synthesis to create a unique uranium&#8208;allyl species with an orbital configuration designed to optimize the potential for ligand&#8208;f orbital bonding. The resulting U&#8208;allyl sandwich complex displays unexpected 3c&#8211;2e bonding between the uranium center and two ligand&#8208;based carbons with a large degree of covalency.







Abstract
A method to explore head&#8208;to&#8208;head &#981; back&#8208;bonding from uranium f&#8208;orbitals into allyl &#960;* orbitals has been pursued. Anionic allyl groups were coordinated to uranium with tethered anilide ligands, then the products were investigated by using NMR spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal XRD, and theoretical methods. The (allyl)silylanilide ligand, N&#8208;((dimethyl)prop&#8208;2&#8208;enylsilyl)&#8208;2,6&#8208;diisopropylaniline (LH), was used as either the fully protonated, singly deprotonated, or doubly deprotonated form, thereby highlighting the stability and versatility of the silylanilide motif. A free, neutral allyl group was observed in UI2(L1)2 (1), which was synthesized by using the mono&#8208;deprotonated ligand [K][N&#8208;((dimethyl)prop&#8208;2&#8208;enyl)silyl)&#8208;2,6&#8208;diisopropylanilide] (L1). The desired homoleptic sandwich complex U[L2]2 (2) was prepared from all three ligand precursors, but the most consistent results came from using the dipotassium salt of the doubly deprotonated ligand [K]2[N&#8208;((dimethyl)propenidesilyl)&#8208;2,6&#8208;diisopropylanilide] (L2). This allyl&#8208;based sandwich complex was studied by using theoretical techniques with supporting experimental spectroscopy to investigate the potential for phi (&#981;) back&#8208;bonding. The bonding between UIV and the allyl fragments is best described as ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal electron donation from a two carbon fragment&#8208;localized electron density into empty f&#8208;orbitals.

         <title>Perovskite Photovoltaics for Artificial Light Harvesting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite photovoltaics are being intensely explored as artificial light cells for harvesting and recycling indoor light energy, which would realize self&#8208;powered internet of things. This Review presents the scope of works in perovskite artificial light cells that have been attained with both material and device engineering, and proposes possible solutions and direction for future research.







Abstract
Perovskites have encountered a growing interest as light&#8208;absorbing materials for harvesting and recycling ambient light. This interest comes from the distinct and impressive intrinsic properties of these materials and is necessitated by the need for reliable and sustainable power supplies for wearable and portable internet of things (IoT) applications. Perovskite artificial light cells (PALCs; i.&#8201;e., indoor perovskite photovoltaics) have been intensively explored, and thus their device performance has been rapidly augmented. In this review, we summarize and consolidate the research outputs of PALCs by focusing on the tuning of photo&#8208;absorber and interlayer materials for efficient harvest and collection of artificial light sources. We also emphasize various challenges and possible future research directions that should be addressed for realizing a large market uptake of PALCs.

         <dc:description>
The importance of O/N&#8208;glycosides as biologically active compounds cannot be overstated. This study is focused on the functionalization of glycals and ribals at the C2 position with alkyl, vinyl, aryl, heteroaryl and strained ring substituents. The functionalized glycals and ribals were transformed into 2&#8208;C&#8208;deoxyglycosides and 2&#8217;&#8208;C&#8208;deoxynucleosides. The application to the synthesis of an analogue of cladribine and clofarabine is described.







Abstract
The synthesis of 2&#8208;C&#8208;glycals and 2&#8208;C&#8208;ribals was achieved in good yields using a nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling between 2&#8208;iodoglycals and 2&#8208;iodoribal respectively and Grignard reagents. The prepared 2&#8208;C&#8208;glycals and ribals were then transformed into 2&#8208;C&#8208;2&#8208;deoxyglycosides, 2&#8208;C&#8208;diglycosides and 2&#8217;&#8208;C&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxynucleosides. The developed method was applied to the synthesis of a 2&#8208;chloroadenine
2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside &#8211; a structural analogue of cladribine (Mavenclad&#174;, Leustatin&#174;) and clofarabine (Clolar&#174;, Evoltra&#174;), two compounds used in the treatment of relapsing&#8208;remitting multiple sclerosis and hairy cell leukemia.

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions in Molecular Systems: Thermodynamic Evaluation of the Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Strength in Amino&#8208;Ethers and Amino&#8208;Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strength of NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O bond in three series of amino&#8208;alcohols characterized by branching, mono&#8208;alkylation of the amino group, or increased chain length between the functional groups, was evaluated by a combination of quantum chemistry and a method based on experimental vaporization enthalpies. It was observed that moderate tertiary branching at the H&#8208;acceptor or at the H&#8208;donor side has only a marginal effect on the NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bond strength so that it remains in the range of &#8722;4&#8197;kJ&#8901;mol&#8722;1 to &#8722;6&#8197;kJ&#8901;mol&#8722;1.







Abstract
The intramolecular hydrogen bond (intra&#8208;HB) is one of the best&#8208;known examples of non&#8208;covalent interactions in molecules. Among the different types of intramolecular hydrogen bonding, the NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bond in amino&#8208;alcohols and amino&#8208;ethers is one of the weakest. In contrast to the strong OH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N intramolecular hydrogen bond, the strength of the NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O bond can hardly be measured with conventional spectroscopic methods, even for simple amino&#8208;alcohols, since the band belonging to the NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O conformer merges with the free OH band. In this work, we developed a combination of G4 calculations, and a method based on experimental vaporization enthalpies to determine the NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bonding strength. The archetypal compounds for this study are 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;ethanol and 3&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;propanol as well as their respective methoxy analogs. Based on these molecules, different series were studied to investigate various factors influencing NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O intra&#8208;HB strength. In the first series, the influence of alkylation near the hydroxy or methoxy group and the amino group in sterically hindered aminoalcohols was examined. In the second series, the influence of alkylation of the amino&#8208;group was investigated. In the third series, the effect of extending the alkyl chain between functional groups was studied.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The strength of NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O bond&lt;/b&gt; in three series of amino-alcohols characterized by branching, mono-alkylation of the amino group, or increased chain length between the functional groups, was evaluated by a combination of quantum chemistry and a method based on experimental vaporization enthalpies. It was observed that moderate tertiary branching at the H-acceptor or at the H-donor side has only a marginal effect on the NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bond strength so that it remains in the range of &#8722;4&#8197;kJ&#8901;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; to &#8722;6&#8197;kJ&#8901;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intramolecular hydrogen bond (intra-HB) is one of the best-known examples of non-covalent interactions in molecules. Among the different types of intramolecular hydrogen bonding, the NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bond in amino-alcohols and amino-ethers is one of the weakest. In contrast to the strong OH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N intramolecular hydrogen bond, the strength of the NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O bond can hardly be measured with conventional spectroscopic methods, even for simple amino-alcohols, since the band belonging to the NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O conformer merges with the free OH band. In this work, we developed a combination of G4 calculations, and a method based on experimental vaporization enthalpies to determine the NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bonding strength. The archetypal compounds for this study are 2-amino-1-ethanol and 3-amino-1-propanol as well as their respective methoxy analogs. Based on these molecules, different series were studied to investigate various factors influencing NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O intra-HB strength. In the first series, the influence of alkylation near the hydroxy or methoxy group and the amino group in sterically hindered aminoalcohols was examined. In the second series, the influence of alkylation of the amino-group was investigated. In the third series, the effect of extending the alkyl chain between functional groups was studied.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Dehydroxyazidation of Alcohols Promoted by Trifunctional Hypervalent Azido&#8208;Iodine(III) Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a mild, metal&#8208;free practical method for late&#8208;stage dehydroxyazidation of structurally complex alcohols promoted by trifunctional hypervalent azido&#8208;iodine(III) reagents ABZ. The reactions proceeded via an SN2 pathway and showed excellent chemoselectivity and stereospecificity and gave the corresponding azides in high yields. The reaction mechanism was investigated by means of experiments and DFT calculations.







Abstract
The development of convenient new methods for the synthesis of organic azides is highly desirable. Herein, we report a practical method for dehydroxyazidation of alcohols via an SN2 pathway involving PPh3 and trifunctional benziodazolone&#8208;based hypervalent azido&#8208;iodine(III) reagents, which function as an electrophilic center, an azido source, and a base. This mild, chemoselective method was used for late&#8208;stage azidation of structurally complex alcohols, as well as for a new synthetic route to the antiepileptic drug rufinamide. The reaction mechanism was also investigated both experimentally and computationally.

         <title>Quantum Chemistry&#8208;based Molecular Dynamics Simulations as a Tool for the Assignment of ESI&#8208;MS/MS Spectra of Drug Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The previously unknown fragmentation pathways of the two drug molecules Nateglinide (45 atoms) and Zopiclone (51 atoms) are completely elucidated using a combination of generic formalisms and calculations conducted with the Quantum Chemical Mass Spectrometry (QCxMS) program. The computations of the de novo fragment spectra were conducted with the semi&#8208;empirical GFNn&#8208;xTB (n=1, 2) methods and compared against Orbitrap measured electrospray ionization (ESI) spectra in positive ion mode.







Abstract
In organic mass spectrometry, fragment ions provide important information on the analyte as a central part of its structure elucidation. With increasing molecular size and possible protonation sites, the potential energy surface (PES) of the analyte can become very complex, which results in a large number of possible fragmentation patterns. Quantum chemical (QC) calculations can help here, enabling the fast calculation of the PES and thus enhancing the mass spectrometry&#8208;based structure elucidation processes. In this work, the previously unknown fragmentation pathways of the two drug molecules Nateglinide (45 atoms) and Zopiclone (51 atoms) were investigated using a combination of generic formalisms and calculations conducted with the Quantum Chemical Mass Spectrometry (QCxMS) program. The computations of the de novo fragment spectra were conducted with the semi&#8208;empirical GFNn&#8208;xTB (n=1, 2) methods and compared against Orbitrap measured electrospray ionization (ESI) spectra in positive ion mode. It was found that the unbiased QC calculations are particularly suitable to predict non&#8208;evident fragment ion structures, sometimes contrasting the accepted generic formulation of fragment ion structures from electron migration rules, where the &#8220;true&#8221; ion fragment structures are approximated. For the first time, all fragment and intermediate structures of these large&#8208;sized molecules could be elucidated completely and routinely using this merger of methods, finding new undocumented mechanisms, that are not considered in common rules published so far. Given the importance of ESI for medicinal chemistry, pharmacokinetics, and metabolomics, this approach can significantly enhance the mass spectrometry&#8208;based structure elucidation processes and contribute to the understanding of previously unknown fragmentation pathways.

         <title>Cocrystal Formation Precedes the Mechanochemically Acetate&#8208;Assisted C&#8722;H Activation with [Cp*RhCl2]2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanistic insights into the mechanochemically acetate&#8208;assisted C&#8722;H activation of nitrogen containing substrates with [Cp*RhCl2]2 are reported in this work. Ex&#8208;situ analysis revealed the formation of unexpected crystalline phases prior to the C&#8722;H activation step, making the mechanochemical pathway different from the mechanism in solution. Moreover, the mechanochemical protocol enabled the synthesis of Cp*Rh(2&#8208;benzilpyridine)Cl, a the six&#8208;membered rhodacycle previously reported as impossible to access in solution.







Abstract
This work reports the experimentally studied mechanochemical formation of rhodacycles by ball milling pyridine&#8208; and quinoline&#8208;derived substrates and [Cp*RhCl2]2 in the presence of NaOAc. Ex&#8208;situ analysis of the mechanochemical reactions using powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), solid&#8208;state UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy and ATR&#8208;FTIR spectroscopy revealed the formation of unexpected cocrystals between the substrates and the rhodium dimer prior to the C&#8722;H activation step. This sequence of events differs from the generally accepted steps in solution in which cleavage of [Cp*RhCl2]2 is initiated by acetate ions. Additionally, the mechanochemical approach enabled the synthesis of the six&#8208;membered rhodacycle [Cp*Rh(2&#8208;benzilpyridine)Cl], a metal complex repeatedly reported as inaccessible in solution. Altogether, the results of this investigation clarify some of the fundamental aspects of mechanochemical cyclometallations.

Coupling organically: The first metal&#8208;catalyzed mono&#8208;&#945;&#8208;arylation of carbonyl compounds employing soluble organic base is reported, with transformations spanning a range of (hetero)aryl electrophiles in combination with feedstock small molecule substrates acetone, dimethylacetamide, and for the first time, ethyl acetate.

We report on our successful development of the first metal&#8208;catalyzed mono&#8208;&#945;&#8208;arylation of carbonyl compounds employing a soluble organic base.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Chromans Through Bifunctional Enamine&#8208;Metal Lewis Acid Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise method for the asymmetric synthesis of tricyclic chromans from salicylaldehydes and cyclic ketones was developed through bifunctional enamine&#8208;metal Lewis acid catalysis. Mechanism of the chroman formation reaction was proposed and investigated with deuterium experiments and DFT calculations. Tricyclic chromans containing three consecutive stereogenic centers were prepared in good yields (up to 87&#8201;%) and stereoselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee and 11&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr).







Abstract
Cooperative enamine&#8208;metal Lewis acid catalysis has emerged as a powerful tool to construct carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond forming reactions. A concise synthetic method for asymmetric synthesis of chromans from cyclohexanones and salicylaldehydes has been developed to afford tricyclic chromans containing three consecutive stereogenic centers in good yields (up to 87&#8201;%) and stereoselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee and 11&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). This difficult organic transformation was achieved through bifunctional enamine&#8208;metal Lewis acid catalysis. It is believed that the strong activation of the salicylaldehydes through chelating to the metal Lewis acid and the bifunctional nature of the catalyst accounts for the high yields and enantioselectivity of the reaction. The absolute configurations of the chroman products were established through X&#8208;ray crystallography. DFT calculations were conducted to understand the mechanism and stereoselectivity of this reaction.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Site&#8208; and Enantioselective Carbene Insertion into Carbon&#8208;Silicon Bonds of Benzosilacyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ligand&#8208;controlled carbene insertion into C(sp3)&#8722;Si and C(sp2)&#8722;Si bonds of benzosilacyclobutanes has been achieved. With sterically bulky BINOL&#8208;based chiral phosphoramidite ligand L1, carbene insertion into the C(sp3)&#8722;Si bond occurred to afford product A in excellent site&#8208; and enantioselectivity. By employing less sterically hindered chiral spiro&#8208;phosphoramidite ligand L2, carbene C(sp2)&#8722;Si bond insertion occurred to give product B with high site&#8208;selectivity. DFT calculation reveals the reaction mechanism and the factors governing the selectivity.







Abstract
We report herein a highly efficient palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbene insertion into strained Si&#8722;C bonds of benzosilacyclobutanes, which provides an efficient method to access &#945;&#8208;chiral silanes. With a sterically hindered ligand, carbene insertion into the C(sp3)&#8722;Si bond of benzosilacyclobutanes occurred in excellent site&#8208; and enantioselectivity, while C(sp2)&#8722;Si bond insertion occurred selectively with less sterically hindered ligands. Reaction mechanism, in particular the roles of the chiral ligands in controlling the site&#8208;selectivity of the insertion reactions, are elucidated by using hybrid density functional theory.

         <title>Reactions of a Four&#8208;Membered Borete with Carbon, Silicon, and Gallium Donor Ligands: Fused and Spiro&#8208;Type Boracycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes or cyclobutanes are dipolar reagents, which are widely used in the synthesis of complex organic (hetero)cycles in ring expansion reactions. Applying this concept to boron containing heterocycles, the four&#8208;membered borete  cyclo  &#8208;  i  Pr  2  N&#8722;BC  10  H  6  reacted with the carbon donor ligands 2,6&#8208;xylylisonitrile and the carbene IMes :C(NMesCH)  2  with ring expansion and ring fusion, respectively. In particular, the tetracyclic structure formed with&#160;IMes displays zwitterionic character and absorption in the visible region. In contrast to the carbene IMes, the heavier carbenoids :Si(NDippCH)  2  and :Ga(AmIm) with a two&#8208;coordinate donor atom afford  spiro  &#8208;type bicyclic compounds, which display four&#8208;coordinate geometry at silicon or gallium. (TD&#8208;)DFT calculations provide deeper insight into the mechanism of formation and the absorption properties of these new compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of a Fully Continuous&#8208;Flow Approach Towards Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Tetrahydroprotoberberine Natural Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Continuous flow synthetic technologies have found tremendous applications and thus immensely promoted total synthesis in the past few decades. However, fully continuous flow synthesis are still extremely limited in multi&#8208;step synthesis of complex natural pharmaceutical molecules. Thus, the development of fully continuous flow total synthesis of natural products is in demand but challenging. Herein, we demonstrated the first fully continuous flow approach towards asymmetric total synthesis of natural tetrahydroprotoberberine alkaloids, (&#8211;)&#8208;isocanadine, (&#8211;)&#8208;tetrahydropseudocoptisine, (&#8211;)&#8208;stylopine and (&#8211;)&#8208;nandinine. This method features a concise linear sequence involving four chemical transformations and three on&#8208;line work&#8208;up processing in an integrated flow platform, without any intermediate purification. The overall yield and enantioselectivity of this four&#8208;step continuous flow chemistry were up to 50% and 92% ee , respectively, in a total residence time of 32.5 min, corresponding to a throughput of 145 mg/h.</dc:description>

Herein, we demonstrated the first fully continuous flow approach towards asymmetric total synthesis of natural tetrahydroprotoberberine alkaloids, (&#8211;)-isocanadine, (&#8211;)-tetrahydropseudocoptisine, (&#8211;)-stylopine and (&#8211;)-nandinine. This method features a concise linear sequence involving four chemical transformations and three on-line work-up processing in an integrated flow platform, without any intermediate purification. The overall yield and enantioselectivity of this four-step continuous flow chemistry were up to 50% and 92% ee , respectively, in a total residence time of 32.5 min, corresponding to a throughput of 145 mg/h.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Eu  2+  , Mn  2+  and Eu  2+  &#8208;Mn  2+  doped CaMgSi  2  O  6  phosphors are prepared by a high temperature solid&#8208;state reaction procedure. It is found that Mn  2+  ions occupy two distinct sites in CaMgSi  2  O  6  by the systematical investigations on concentration&#8208; and temperature&#8208; dependent luminescence of Mn  2+  . The electron&#8208;vibrational interaction (EVI) analyses of Mn  2+  ions reveal the Huang&#8208;Rhys factors of 4.73 and 2.82 as well as the effective phonon energies of 313 and 383 cm  &#8208;1  for two sites. Further, the Eu  2+  &#8208;Mn  2+  energy transfer is discussed and its efficiency is estimated by lifetime and luminescence spectra, respectively. The different thermal quenching behaviours of Eu  2+  and Mn  2+  , the distinct emission colours of Eu  2+  (blue, band peak at ~451 nm) and Mn  2+  (yellow&#8208;red range, band peaks at ~583 and 693 nm) endow the co&#8208;doped samples potential applications in luminescence thermometry and temperature/excitation wavelength responsive dual anti&#8208;counterfeiting.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting from a Discrete Hybrid Bismuth Bromide Ferroelectric Templated by Phosphonium Cation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bismuth containing hybrid molecular ferroelectrics are receiving tremendous attention in recent years owing to their stable and non&#8208;toxic composition. However, these perovskite&#8208;like structures are primarily limited to ammonium cations. Herein, we report a new phosphonium based discrete perovskite&#8208;like hybrid ferroelectric with a formula [Me(Ph)  3  P]  3  [Bi  2  Br  9  ] (  MTPBB  ) and its mechanical energy harvesting capability. The Polarization&#8208;Electric field (  P&#8208;E  ) measurements resulted in a well&#8208;defined ferroelectric hysteresis loop with a remnant polarization value of 2.1  &#181;  C cm  &#8208;2  . Piezoresponse force microscopy experiments enabled visualization of the ferroelectric domain structure and evaluation of the piezoelectric strain coefficient (  d  33  ) for an&#160; MTPBB  single crystal and thin film sample. Furthermore, flexible devices incorporating  MTPBB  in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix at various concentrations were fabricated and explored for their mechanical energy harvesting properties. The champion device with 20 wt. % of  MTPBB  in PDMS rendered a maximum peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak open&#8208;circuit voltage of 22.9 V and a maximum power density of 7  &#181;  W cm  &#8208;2  at an optimal load of 4 M&#937;. Moreover, the potential of  MTPBB  &#8208;based devices in low power electronics was demonstrated by storing the harvested energy in various electrolytic capacitors.</dc:description>

         <title>First&#8208;principles design of Na&#8208;ion superionic conductors: Interstitial&#8208;based Na diffusion in NaCuZrS3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SS&#8208;SIBs) have drawn significant attention due to their potential to be safer and lower cost than lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the lack of sodium solid&#8208;state electrolytes with high ionic conductivity has become one of the major challenges. Here, with first&#8208;principles computation we took NaCuZrS3 , consisting of earth&#8208;abundant and environmentally benign elements only, as an example to study Na&#8208;ion transport in the post&#8208;perovskite&#8208;like structure and used computation&#8208;guided design to improve its potential as a solid&#8208;state electrolyte. With ab initio molecular dynamics simulation and nudged elastic band calculation, we studied possible diffusion mechanisms in this material and found that Na ion interstitials have a favorable migration barrier of 0.22 eV, which is among the smallest in the literature reported values. Considering the large formation energy of Frenkel defects, we proposed doping strategy to introduce extra Na interstitials in the material. Our study suggests that the post&#8208;perovskite&#8208;like sulfides are worth of exploration for applications in SS&#8208;SIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Glucosylated 5&#8208;hydroxymethylpyrimidines as epigenetic DNA bases regulating transcription and restriction cleavage</title>

The presence of any glucosylated pyrimidines fully protected DNA from cleavage by type II restriction endonucleases. On the other hand, while the presence of glucosylated 5hmU completely inhibited transcription by bacterial ( Escherichia coli ) RNA polymerase, the DNA containing the corresponding glucosylated 5hmC allowed a similar level of transcription as natural DNA. This suggests different roles of these hypermodified bases in epigenetic regulation of transcription in bacteriophages or kinetoplastid parasites. Consequently, enzymatic glucosylation of 5hmC&#8208;containing DNA can be used for tuning of transcription activity.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes Carrying Weakly Coordinating Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this concept article we provide a brief overview of the design and preparation of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes carrying weakly coordinating anions (WCA&#8208;NHCs). The anionic charge in these ligand systems is located on an exocyclic group,  e.g  ., B(C6F5)3  , tethered to the backbone of the imidazole ring, thus resembling a weakly coordinating moiety. With the general guiding principle behind the application of WCA&#8208;NHCs being the conversion of otherwise cationic NHC complexes into their overall neutral congeners, numerous transition metal as well as main group element complexes were isolated during the last decade, which are summarized herein.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of the carbene&#8208;stabilized boryl phosphinidenes (  1  &#8208;  3  ). The compounds (  1  &#8208;  3  ) are obtained by reaction of Me&#8208;cAAC=PK (Me  2  &#8208;cAAC = dimethyl cyclic (alkyl) (amino) carbene) and dihaloarylborane in toluene. All three compounds are characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Quantum mechanical studies indicate that these compounds have two lone pairs on the P&#8208;center viz., &#963;&#8208;type&#8208;lone pair, and a 'hidden' p&#8208;type&#8208;lone pair. Hence, these compounds can act as double Lewis bases, and the basicity of the p&#8208;type lone pair is higher than the &#963;&#8208;type&#8208;lone pair.</dc:description>

Quantum mechanical studies indicate that these compounds have two lone pairs on the P-center viz., &#963;-type-lone pair, and a 'hidden' p-type-lone pair. Hence, these compounds can act as double Lewis bases, and the basicity of the p-type lone pair is higher than the &#963;-type-lone pair.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quantum Spin 1/2 Dimers in a Low Dimensional Tetrabromocuprate Magnet</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work describes a homometallic spin &#189; tetrabromocuprate adopting a bilayer structure. Magnetic susceptibility measurements show a broad maximum centered near 70 K, with fits to this data using a Heisenberg model consistent with strong antiferromagnetic coupling between neighboring Cu in different layers of the bilayer. There are further weak intralayer ferromagnetic interactions between Cu cations in neighboring dimers. First principles calculations are consistent with this but suggest there is only significant magnetic coupling within one direction of a layer; this would suggest the presence of a spin&#8208;ladder within the bilayer with antiferromagnetic rung and weaker ferromagnetic rail couplings.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;phase precursors for the preparation of spinel ferrites via oxalate route: the study of cobalt ferrite synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work explores the benefits of single&#8208;phase oxalate precursors for the preparation of spinel ferrites by thermal decomposition. A direct comparison between the genuine oxalate solid solution and the physical mixture of simple oxalates is presented using the case study of cobalt ferrite preparation. The mixing of metal cations within a single oxalate structure could be verified prior to its thermal decomposition by several non&#8208;destructive experimental techniques, namely M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray powder diffraction (XRD) and energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy. In&#8208;situ XRD experiments were conducted to compare the decomposition processes of the solid solution and the physical mixture. Additionally, the decomposition products of the FeCo oxalate solid solution were studied ex&#8208;situ by means of N  2  adsorption, M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and XRD. The results obtained for different reaction temperatures demonstrate the possibilities to easily control the physical properties of the prepared oxides.</dc:description>

         <title>Orthogonalization of polyaryl linkers as a route to more porous phosphonate metal&#8208;organic frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphonate metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) offer more robust structures than the majority of MOFs. However, the coordinative pliancy of the phosphonate functional group means that metal&#8208;phosphonate materials have easier routes to well&#8208;packed structures with minimal porosity as efficient inter&#8208;ligand packing is enabled. Here, we apply a ligand orthogonalization strategy to form more porous phosphonate MOFs. We report a multistep synthesis of an orthogonalized aryl&#8208;phosphonate linker, 1,3,5&#8208;tris(4&#8217;&#8208;phosphonophenyl)&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzene (H6L2). To illustrate the general structure directing role of the linker, we report a series of six crystalline metal&#8208;phosphonate frameworks (CALF 35&#8208;39) by coordinating divalent metals (Ba, Sr, Ca, Mg, Zn). When coordinated to metals, H6L2 is unable to pack efficiently and, as a consequence, yields several distinct microporous structures. The resulting structures are discussed in detail, with a focus on solid&#8208;state packing of the sterically rigidified linker. Combined with larger cations (Sr, and Ba), H6L2 packs in a parallel&#8208;offset manner, yielding isomorphous and microporous metal&#8208;organic frameworks (CALF&#8208;35 (Sr), and (Ba)). When coordinated to smaller metals (Ca, Mg, Zn), H6L2 forms four new structures. Two Ca MOFs of different stoichiometry, (CALF&#8208;36 and 37) and a Mg MOF CALF&#8211;38 show narrow pores and have high selectivities for CO2 over N2 and CH4. Finally, in CALF&#8208;39 (Zn), H6L2 linkers pack in a herringbone fashion, resulting in a material with 10.9 x 10.1 &#197;2 square channels. Stability testing of all structures was carried out and the most porous structure, CALF&#8208;39 (Zn) retained its structure and gas adsorption after immersion in water over pH 3&#8208;11.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Pressure&#8208;induced phase transitions of M  I  Ag  II  F  3  perovskites (M = K, Rb, Cs) have been predicted theoretically for the first time for pressures up to 100 GPa. The sequence of phase transitions for M = K and Rb consists of an orthorhombic to monoclinic and back to orthorhombic transition, associated with progressive bending of infinite chains of corner&#8208;sharing [AgF  6  ]  4&#8211;  octahedra and their mutual approaching via secondary Ag&#183;&#183;&#183;F contacts. In stark contrast, only a single phase transition (tetragonal &#8594; triclinic) is predicted for CsAgF  3  , associated with substantial deformation of the Jahn Teller&#8208;distorted first coordination sphere of Ag(II) and association of the infinite [AgF  6  ]  4&#8211;  chains into a polymeric sublattice.

         <title>pH&#8208;triggered removal of nitrogenous organic micropollutants from water by metal&#8208;organic polyhedra</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water pollution threatens human and environmental health worldwide. Thus, there is a pressing need for new approaches to water purification. Herein we report a novel supramolecular strategy based on the use of a metal organic polyhedron (MOP) as a capture agent to remove nitrogenous organic micropollutants from water, even at very low concentrations (ppm), based exclusively on coordination chemistry at the external surface of the MOP. Specifically, we exploit the exohedral coordination positions of Rh(II)&#8208;MOP to coordinatively sequester pollutants bearing N&#8208;donor atoms in aqueous solution, and then harness their exposed surface carboxyl groups to control their aqueous solubility via acid/base reactions. We validated this approach for removal of benzotriazole, benzothiazole, isoquinoline, and 1&#8208;napthylamine from water.</dc:description>

         <title>1,2&#8208;Carboboration of Arylallenes by In Situ Generated Alkenylboranes for the Synthesis of 1,4&#8208;Dienes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein report a novel method for the coupling of unactivated alkynes and arylallenes, which relies on an unprecedented and regioselective 1,2&#8208;carboboration of the allene by an alkenylborane. The alkenylborane is conveniently prepared  in situ  by hydroboration of an alkyne with Piers' borane,  i. e.  HB(C  6  F  5  )  2  . The boryl&#8208;substituted 1,4&#8208;dienes that are formed by this carboboration are well&#8208;suited for a subsequent Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling with aryl iodides. This allowed us to develop a three&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot protocol for the synthesis of aryl&#8208;substituted 1,4&#8208;dienes. The generality of the reaction was demonstrated by the synthesis of twenty dienes with modular variations of all three reaction partners. The mechanism of the new 1,2&#8208;carboboration was investigated using dispersion corrected double&#8208;hybrid DFT computations that allowed us to rationalize the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity of this key step.</dc:description>

The mechanism of the new 1,2-carboboration was investigated using dispersion corrected double-hybrid DFT computations that allowed us to rationalize the chemo- and regioselectivity of this key step.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>The oxidation of [(Cp*Mo)2(&#181;,&#627;6:&#627;6&#8208;P6)] ( 1 ) with halogens or halogen sources was investigated.

         <title>Effects of Cis/Trans&#8208;configuration and Ligand Substitution of the Cyanidometal Bridge on Metal to Metal Charge Transfer Properties in Mixed Valence Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To investigate the effects of cis/trans&#8208;configuration of the cyanidometal bridge and the electron donating ability of the auxiliary ligand on the cyanidometal bridge on metal to metal charge transfer (MMCT) in cyanidometal&#8208;bridged mixed valence compounds, two groups of trinuclear cyanidometal&#8208;bridged compounds cis/trans&#8208;[Cp(dppe)Fe(&#956;&#8208;NC)Ru(4,4'&#8208;dmbpy)2(&#956;&#8208;CN)Fe(dppe)Cp][PF6]n  (n = 2 (cis/trans&#8208;1[PF6]2), 3 (cis/trans&#8208;1[PF6]3  ), 4 (cis/trans&#8208;1[PF6]4)) and cis/trans&#8208;[Cp(dppe)Fe(&#956;&#8208;NC)Ru(bpy)2(&#956;&#8208;CN)Fe(dppe)Cp][PF6]3  (cis/trans&#8208;2[PF6]3)&#160;were synthesized and fully characterized. The experimental results indicate that for these one&#8208; and two&#8208;electron oxidation mixed valence compounds, the trans&#8208;configuration compounds are more beneficial for MMCT than the cis&#8208;configuration compounds, and increasing the electron donating ability of the auxiliary ligand on the cyanidometal bridge is also conductive to MMCT. Moreover, compounds  cis/trans&#8208;1[PF6]n  (n = 3, 4) and  cis/trans&#8208;2[PF6]3  belong to localized compounds by analyzing the experimental characterization results, supported by the TDDFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;free thermal synthesis of extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore aluminophosphate zeotype via self&#8208;assembly of double&#8208;four&#8208;ring unit</title>

         <dc:description>The use of Ge as framework atom to direct the formation of double&#8208;four&#8208;ring (d4r) unit is an effective way to prepare zeolite with extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore, which however also brings about serious problems with regard to production cost and structure stability for their practical application. A new solvent&#8208;free thermal synthesis strategy is presented here for facile preparation and molecular&#8208;level mechanism study of extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore aluminophosphate zeotype DNL&#8208;1 with &#8208;CLO structure. For the first time, the formation of intermediate d4r in the induction period was successfully confirmed, and was correlated with the synthesis condition of low water content and quaternary ammonium template with suitable alkyl chain length. The self&#8208;assembly pathway via d4r to form lta, afterwards clo and super cages was further revealed. This work shed light on the rational synthesis of Ge&#8208;free extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore zeotypes based on d4r route.</dc:description>

         <title>On the mediated electron transfer of immobilized galactose oxidase for biotechnological applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of enzymes as catalysts in chemical synthesis offers advantages in terms of clean and highly selective transfor&#173;mations. Galactose oxidase (GalOx) is a remarkable enzyme with several applications in industrial conversions as it catalyzes the oxidation of primary alcohols. We investigate the wiring of GalOx with a redox polymer, enabling mediated electron transfer with the electrode surface. As a result of the electrochemical regeneration with minimal influence from O2, the formation of harmful H2O2 is prevented during enzymatic catalysis. The possibility for catalytic conversion with the introduced bioelectrode is shown with a parti&#173;cular emphasis on glycerol as model substrate. We also show that the enzyme can perform the over&#8208;oxidation of the substrate, lea&#173;ding not only to the corresponding aldehyde but also to the carboxylic acid by further conversion of the former.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic control of microbial movement by photoswitchable ATP antagonists</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the energy source for various biochemical processes and biomolecular motors in living things. Development of ATP antagonists and their stimuli&#8208;controlled actions offer a novel approach to regulate biological processes. Herein, we developed azobenzene&#8208;based photoswitchable ATP antagonists for controlling the activity of motor proteins; cytoplasmic and axonemal dyneins. The new ATP antagonsits showed reversible photoswitching of cytoplasmic dynein activity in an  in vitro  dynein&#8208;microtubule system due to the  trans  and  cis  photoisomerization of their azobenzene segment. Importantly, our ATP antagonists reversibly regulated the axonemal dynein motor activity for the force generation in a demembranated model of  Chlamydomonas reinhardtii  . We found that the  trans  and  cis  isomers of ATP antagonists significantly differ in their affinity to the ATP binding site.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Atomic Fe and N Co&#8208;doped Hollow Carbon Nanospheres with A Polymer Encapsulation Strategy for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries with Accelerated Polysulfide Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As competitive next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries, lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs) could suffer from the shuttle effect and the sluggish kinetics of intermediate polysulfides during charge and discharge processes, adversely affecting their electrochemical performances and actual applications. Herein, we demonstrate a polymer encapsulation strategy to synthesize atomic Fe and N co&#8208;doped hollow carbon nanospheres (Fe&#8208;NHC) with Fe&#8208;N  x  sites for modifying commercial PP separator of LSBs to suppress the shuttle effect and promote the sluggish kinetics of intermediate polysulfides. Benefiting from the excellent structural design, the doped&#8208;N with positive charges could effectively adsorb negatively charged soluble polysulfides, help attract the soluble polysulfides to the Fe atoms and boost the catalytic transformation of the soluble polysulfides. Additionally, such a thin carbon shell could provide a short mass diffusion pathway and hence promote the adsorption and the catalytic conversion. Therefore, the battery with the Fe&#8208;NHC/PP separator delivers outstanding cycling and rate performances. At the large current density of 1C, the specific capacity is 1079 mA h g  &#8208;1  and maintains a low loss of 0.076% per cycle within 500 cycles. Even at a harsh current density of 4C, a high capacity of 824 mA h g  &#8208;1  is still achieved, indicating the superiority of the Fe&#8208;NHC/PP separator in LSBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Generalizing the aromatic &#948;&#8208;amino acid foldamer helix</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of aromatic oligoamide foldamer sequences containing different proportions of three &#948;&#8208;amino acids derived from quinoline, pyridine, and benzene and possessing varying flexibility,  e.g.  due to methylene bridges, were synthesized. Crystallographic structures of two key sequences and  1  H NMR data in water concur to show that a canonical aromatic helix fold prevails in almost all cases and that helix stability critically depends on the ratio between rigid and flexible units. Notwithstanding subtle variations of curvature,  i.e.  the numbers of units per turn, the aromatic &#948;&#8208;peptide helix is therefore shown to be general and tolerant of a great number of sp  3  centers. We also demonstrate canonical helical folding upon alternating two monomers that do not promote folding when taken separately: folding occurs with two methylenes between every other unit, not with one methylene between every unit. These findings highlight that a fine&#8208;tuning of helix handedness inversion kinetics, curvature, and side chain positioning in aromatic &#948;&#8208;peptidic foldamers can be realized by systematically combining different yet compatible &#948;&#8208;amino acids.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable Triarylmethyl Radicals and Cobalt(II) Ions Based 1D/2D Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of organic radicals into coordination polymers was considered as a promising strategy to promote metal&#8208;ligand exchange interaction, but there are only very limited number of stable organic radical&#8208;based ligands that can serve well such purpose. Herein, we report two new tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM) radical&#8208;based ligands  L1  and  L2  with two and three imidazole substituents, respectively. The imidazole unit serves as a coordination site and it can also stabilize the TTM radical by intramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor interaction. Coordination of  L1  and  L2  with cobalt(II) ions gave the corresponding one&#8208;dimensional (  CoCP&#8208;1  ) and two&#8208;dimensional (  CoCP&#8208;2  ) coordination polymers, the structures of which were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Magnetic measurements and theoretical calculations suggest antiferromagnetic coupling between the paramagnetic  cobalt(II) ions  and the radical ligands. Our study provides a rational design for stable organic radical&#8208;based ligands and further demonstrated the feasibility of metal&#8208;radical approach toward magnetic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Designer Gold&#8208;Framed Palladium Nanocubes for Plasmon&#8208;Enhanced Electrocatalytic Oxidation of Ethanol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface plasmon of coinage metal nanostructures has been employed as a powerful route in boosting the performances in heterogenous catalysis. Development of efficient plasmonic nanocatalysts with high catalytic performance and efficient light harvesting properties is of vital importance. Herein, we rationally designed and synthesized a plasmonic nanocatalyst composed of Au&#8208;framed Pd nanocubes by an Ag(I)&#8208;assisted seed&#8208;mediated growth method. In the synthesis, the incorporation of Ag(I) suppresses the reduction of Au on the {100} surface of cubic Pd seeds and leads to the formation of Au nanoframes on the Pd nanocubes. The unique Au&#8208;framed Pd nanocubes can integrate the superior electrocatalytic of Pd and the outstanding plasmonic properties of Au. Thus, these nanostructures were employed as plasmonic nanocatalysts for plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrocatalytic oxidation of ethanol with improved stability.</dc:description>

         <title>2&#8208;Aminoalkylgold complexes: the putative intermediate in Au&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of alkenes does not protodemetalate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Au&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination proceeds well for alkynes but not alkenes. We report gas&#8208;phase binding energies of alkenes and alkynes to a cationic Au center which indicate that differences in binding are not the origin of the disparate chemical behavior. We further report the synthesis and characterization of 2&#8208;aminoalkylgold complexes which would be the intermediates in a hypothetical Au&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of styrene. The reactivity of the well&#8208;characterized and isolable complexes reveals that protonation or alkylation of the 2&#8208;aminoalkylgold complexes results in amine elimination in solution, and in the gas phase, indicating that the failure of Au&#8208;catalyzed alkene hydroamination derives from a non&#8208;competitive protodeauration step. We analyze possible transition states for the protodeauration, and identify an insufficiently strong Au&#8208;proton interaction as the reason that the transition states lie too high in energy to compete.</dc:description>

         <title>How the Chalcogen Atom Size Dictates the Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Donor Capability of Carboxamides, Thioamides, and Selenoamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The amino groups of thio&#8208; and selenoamides can act as stronger hydrogen&#8208;bond donors than of carboxamides, despite the lower electronegativity of S and Se. This phenomenon has been experimentally explored, particularly in organocatalysis, but a sound electronic explanation is lacking. Our quantum chemical investigations show that the NH 2 groups in thio&#8208; and selenoamides are more positively charged than in carboxamides. This originates from the larger electronic density flow from the nitrogen lone pair of the NH 2 group towards the lower&#8208;lying &#960;* C=S and &#960;* C=Se orbitals, than to the high&#8208;lying &#960;* C=O . The relative energies of the &#960;* orbitals result from the overlap between the chalcogen n p and carbon 2p atomic orbitals, which is set by the carbon&#8211;chalcogen equilibrium distance, a consequence of the Pauli repulsion between the two bonded atoms. Thus, not the electronegativity nor the often&#8208;suggested polarizability but the steric size of the chalcogen atom determines the amide&#8217;s hydrogen&#8208;bond donor capability.</dc:description>

         <title>Functional Groups Assisted Tunable Dielectric Permittivity of Guest&#8208;Free Zn&#8208;Based Coordination Polymers for Gate Dielectrics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dielectric properties of coordination polymers has been a topic of recent interest, but the role of different functional groups on the dielectric properties of these polymers has not yet been fully addressed. Herein, the effects of electron&#8208;donating (R = NH  2  ) and electron&#8208;withdrawing (R = NO  2  ) groups on the dielectric behavior of such materials were investigated for two thermally stable and guest&#8208;free Zn&#8208;based coordination polymers, [Zn(L  1  )(L  2  )]  n  (  1  ) and [Zn(L  1  )(L  3  )]  n  (  2  ) [L  1  = 2&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)benzimidazole, L  2  = Pbim 5&#8208;aminoisophthalate (Aip), and L  3  = 5&#8208;nitroisophthalate (Nip)]. The results of dielectric studies of  1  revealed that it possesses a high dielectric constant (&#954; = 65.5 at 1 kHz), while compound  2  displayed an even higher dielectric constant (&#954; = 110.3 at 1 kHz). The electron donating and withdrawing effects of the NH  2  and NO  2  substituents induce changes in the polarity of the polymers, which is due to the inductive effect from the aryl ring for both NO  2  and NH  2  but the effect is more pronounced. Theoretical results from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which also support the experimental findings, show that both compounds have a distinct electronic behavior with diverse wide bandgaps. The significance of the current work is to provide information about the structure&#8208;dielectric property relationships. So, this study promises to pave the way for further research on the effects of different functional groups on coordination polymers on their dielectric properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Acenaphthenoannulation Induced by Dual Lewis Acidity of Alumina</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have discovered dual (i.e., soft and hard) Lewis acidity of alumina that enables rapid one&#8208;pot &#960;&#8208;extension through activation of terminal alkynes followed by C&#8208;F activation. The tandem reaction introduces acenaphthene fragment &#8211; an essential moiety of geodesic polyarenes. This reaction provides quick access to elusive non&#8208;alternant polyarenes such as &#960;&#8208;extended buckybowls and helicenes via three&#8208;point annulation of naphthalene&#8217;s moiety. The versatility of the developed method is demonstrated by the synthesis of unprecedented structural fragments of elusive geodesic graphene nanoribbons.</dc:description>

         <title>Glutathione&#8208;Responsive Heterogeneous Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Hybrids for Photodynamic&#8208;Gene Synergetic Cell Apoptosis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intracellular excessive glutathione (GSH) consumes the cytotoxic  1  O  2  significantly, restricting the development and efficacy of  1  O  2  &#8208;mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT). To face with this challenge, herein a heterogeneous metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) nanohybrid was sequentially fabricated with porous coordination network&#8208;typed MOF as the core and photosensitizer, and Cu  II  &#8208;centered zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;67 as shell encapsulating cyanine 3&#8208;labelled siRNA. Upon internalized by cells and activated by GSH, the outer shell dissociated and released dye&#8208;labelled siRNA for GSH imaging and subsequent gene silencing in a controllable way. Meanwhile, the photosensitizing core was synchronously unlocked for the GSH&#8208;depleted intensified PDT along with the dissociation. The heterogeneous nanosystem achieved efficiently imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic&#8208;gene theranostics with the cell apoptosis of 81.3%, which was 2.2 folded than that without PDT. Overall, the core&#8208;shell heterogeneous MOF hybrids exerted effective photodynamic&#8208;gene synergetic therapeutic efficacy by surmounting GSH&#8208;associated resistance, and paved a new way for designing intracellular stimulus&#8208;activated theranostic strategies.</dc:description>
