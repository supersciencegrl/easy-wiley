         <title>N2 Reduction versus H2 Evolution in a Molybdenum&#8208; or Tungsten&#8208;Based Small&#8208;Molecule Model System of Nitrogenase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selectivity between the reduction of dinitrogen (N2RR) and the evolution of hydrogen (HER) is investigated experimentally and by DFT calculations based on Mo&#8208; and W&#8208;based model systems. Moreover, possible reaction mechanisms for N2RR, as well as for HER, are determined and discussed in detail.







Abstract
Molybdenum dinitrogen complexes have played a major role as catalytic model systems of nitrogenase. In comparison, analogous tungsten complexes have in most cases found to be catalytically inactive. Herein, a tungsten complex was shown to be supported by a pentadentate tetrapodal (pentaPod) phosphine ligand, under conditions of N2 fixation, primarily catalyzes the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), in contrast to its Mo analogue, which catalytically mediates the nitrogen&#8208;reduction reaction (N2RR). DFT calculations were employed to evaluate possible mechanisms and identify the most likely pathways of N2RR and HER activities exhibited by Mo&#8208; and W&#8208;pentaPod complexes. Two mechanisms for N2RR by PCET are considered, starting from neutral (M(0) cycle) and cationic (M(I) cycle) dinitrogen complexes (M=Mo, W). The latter was found to be energetically more favorable. For HER three scenarios are treated; that is, through bimolecular reactions of early M&#8208;NxHy intermediates, pure hydride intermediates or mixed M(H)(NxHy) species.

         <title>Stable Organic Radicals Participation in Charge Transfer: A New Strategy toward Molecular Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable organic radicals can serve as ideal building blocks for the construction of molecular functional materials due to their unique open&#8208;shell structures. In this Concept, both recent experimental progress and design strategies of stable organic radicals participating in charge transfer as open&#8208;shell donors, acceptors, and dimers to construct functional materials are discussed.







Abstract
Charge&#8208;transfer (CT) engineering with inter&#8208;/intramolecular CT interactions by simple compositions has emerged as a universal and efficient way to construct organic functional materials. Stable organic radicals with unique physicochemical properties that cannot be realized in closed&#8208;shell molecules, have been widely demonstrated to be ideal building blocks to construct versatile organic CT materials. This concept article provides a brief overview of the advances in the design, structure and property of stable organic radicals&#8208;based CT molecular functional materials, and the strategy for the generation of these materials is also highlighted. First, radicals are introduced as open&#8208;shell donors or acceptors, with a focus on their importance and uniqueness in improving electrical, magnetic and optical properties of CT functional materials. Additionally, CT interactions in stable radical dimers and trimers are further discussed systematically. Finally, the challenges are summarized and perspectives for future development of stable organic radicals&#8208;based CT functional materials are provided.

         <title>Divergent Construction of N&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons with Indole as the&#160;Nitrogen Source Building Block</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An Ag/Au catalyzed divergent cascade reaction of alkyne embedded diazoketones with indoles has been described. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction goes through a [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of an in situ formed isobenzopyrylium intermediate with indole, followed by a sequential retro&#8208;Michael addition/carbene N&#8208;H insertion process to give the benzo[i]phenanthridines products with gold catalysis; whereas a dearomatization/rearomatization sequence occurs favourably when the reaction is catalyzed by a silver catalyst, delivering benzo[b]carbazoles in generally high to excellent yields. Notably, this is a rare example of using indole as the dienophile for cycloaddition with the isobenzopyrylium species, providing a concise and practical approach for the selective construction of N&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with structural diversity and broad functional group compatibility.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Responsive Hydrocarbons Designed by &#960;&#8208;Extension of Indeno[1,2,3,4&#8208;pgra]perylene at the 1,2,12&#8208;Positions</title>

         <dc:description>The relationship between the overall electronic structure of &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules and the arrangement of their constituent elements is of fundamental importance. Establishing rational design guidelines for conjugated hydrocarbons with narrow HOMO&#8211;LUMO gaps is useful to develop near&#8208;infrared (NIR) responsive dyes and redox&#8208;active materials. Here, we describe the synthesis and properties of three conjugated hydrocarbons, i.e., an indenonaphthoperylene, an indenoterrylene, and a diindenoterrylene. These molecules exhibit NIR absorption despite the absence of significant antiaromaticity and diradical character. Notably, the indenonaphthoperylene exhibits red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR emission in the 620&#8211;850 nm region. The indenoterrylene and the diindenoterrylene exhibit NIR absorption tailing to 870 and 940 nm, respectively. Moreover, the effect of the &#960;&#8208;extension of indenoperylene is disclosed in order to propose guidelines for achieving a narrow HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap with negligible antiaromaticity and diradical character.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) have shown great potential in separation, sensing and host&#8208;guest chemistry, however, the pre&#8208;design of HOFs remains challenging due to the uncertainty of solvents' participation in framework formation. Herein, the polarity&#8208;evolution&#8208;controlled framework/luminescence regulation was firstly demonstrated based on multiple&#8208;site hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks. Several distinct HOFs were prepared by changing bonding modes of building units via the evolution of electrostatic forces induced by various solvent polarities. High&#8208;polar solvents with strong electrostatic attraction to surrounding units showed the tendency to form cage structures, while low&#8208;polar solvents with weak electrostatic attraction only occupy hydrogen&#8208;bond sites, conducive to the channel formation. Furthermore, the conformation of optical building unit can be adjusted by affecting the solvent polarity, generating different luminescence outputs. These results pave ways for the rational design of ideal HOFs with on&#8208;demand framework regulation and luminescence properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Bifunctional Ru&#8208;Cluster&#8208;Decorated Co3B&#8722;Co(OH)2 Hybrid Catalyst Synergistically Promotes NaBH4 Hydrolysis and Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic synergy: A well&#8208;dispersed Ru&#8208;nanocluster&#8208;decorated Co3B&#8722;Co(OH)2 hybrid catalyst is constructed by steps of electroless plating, calcination and chemical reduction methods. The resulting catalyst exhibits excellent NaBH4 hydrolysis and electrocatalytic HER activity, which is mainly attributed to the synergistic effect of Ru clusters with Co3B&#8722;Co(OH)2, and the large surface area exposed more active sites.







Abstract
Developing a highly efficient bifunctional catalyst for hydrolysis of metal hydrides and spontaneous hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is essential for substituting conventional fuels for H2 production. Herein, Ru&#8208;cluster&#8208;modified Co3B&#8722;Co(OH)2 supported on nickel foam (Ru/Co3B&#8722;Co(OH)2@NF) is constructed by electroless deposition, calcination and chemical reduction. The catalyst exhibits an excellent hydrogen generation rate (HGR) of 4989&#8197;mL&#8201;min&#8722;1 
 and good reusability, superior to most previously reported catalysts. Besides, Ru/Co3B&#8722;Co(OH)2@NF displays a prominent hydrogen evolution reaction catalytic capability with a low overpotential of 153.0&#8197;mV at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (50.5&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), a small Tafel slope of 40.0&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 and long&#8208;term stability (100&#8197;h@10&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in 1.0&#8197;M KOH. The excellent catalytic H2 generation capacity benefits from the rapid charge transfer promoted by metallic Co3B, the synergistic catalytic effect of Co3B&#8722;Co(OH)2 and Ru clusters, and the unique composite structure favorable for solute transport and gas emission.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Catalytic synergy&lt;/b&gt;: A well-dispersed Ru-nanocluster-decorated Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;B&#8722;Co(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hybrid catalyst is constructed by steps of electroless plating, calcination and chemical reduction methods. The resulting catalyst exhibits excellent NaBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; hydrolysis and electrocatalytic HER activity, which is mainly attributed to the synergistic effect of Ru clusters with Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;B&#8722;Co(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and the large surface area exposed more active sites.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing a highly efficient bifunctional catalyst for hydrolysis of metal hydrides and spontaneous hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is essential for substituting conventional fuels for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production. Herein, Ru-cluster-modified Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;B&#8722;Co(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; supported on nickel foam (Ru/Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;B&#8722;Co(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@NF) is constructed by electroless deposition, calcination and chemical reduction. The catalyst exhibits an excellent hydrogen generation rate (HGR) of 4989&#8197;mL&#8201;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; 
 and good reusability, superior to most previously reported catalysts. Besides, Ru/Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;B&#8722;Co(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@NF displays a prominent hydrogen evolution reaction catalytic capability with a low overpotential of 153.0&#8197;mV at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (50.5&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), a small Tafel slope of 40.0&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and long-term stability (100&#8197;h@10&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) in 1.0&#8197;M KOH. The excellent catalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation capacity benefits from the rapid charge transfer promoted by metallic Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;B, the synergistic catalytic effect of Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;B&#8722;Co(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Ru clusters, and the unique composite structure favorable for solute transport and gas emission.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Azatriseptanes: Strained Framework Analogs of [7,7,7]Circulenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strain on the properties: A [7,7,7]circulene analog, azatriseptane, has been synthesized, and its highly strained structure confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography and computational studies. The distortion of the typical propeller&#8208;like conformation that is observed for triarylamine significantly affects the &#960;&#8208;electronics as well as the inherent self&#8208;assembly properties of these bridged systems.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of heptagon&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic compounds are essential for understanding the effect of negative curvature on carbon allotropes such as fullerenes and graphenes that have applications in functional organic materials. However, owing to the synthetic difficulties in functionalizing and embedding seven&#8208;membered rings, these strain&#8208;challenged structures are relatively unexplored. We report here the synthesis, characterization, and properties of a triarylamine core bridged with ethano chains at the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;positions. In doing so, we provide access to the first heterocycle containing three fused heptagon rings with a nitrogen at its core (BATA&#8208;NHAc). X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and DFT calculations revealed a remarkably strained structure wherein two of the bridged aryl units approach coplanarity, while the third ring is twisted out of plane at 70&#176;. UV&#8208;vis and emission spectroscopies identify red&#8208;shifted absorption and concentration&#8208;dependent emission profiles, respectively, as a result of the unique conformation and self&#8208;assembly properties of BATA&#8208;NHAc. Furthermore, cyclic voltammetry shows a decrease in the oxidation potential for BATA&#8208;NHAc in comparison to the non&#8208;bridged analog. This study opens new avenues in understanding the structure&#8211;property relationships of curved &#960;&#8208;aromatics and the construction of &#960;&#8208;frameworks of increasing complexity.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Driven by renewable solar energy, photocatalytic CO hydrogenation offers a promising way to synthesize valuable hydrocarbon chemicals. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202891), M. Zhong and co&#8208;workers show that an efficient photochemical and photothermal synergy between the nearby catalytic and plasmonic centers can accelerate the reaction. By using Co&#8722;Fe5C2 on a TiC photocatalyst, a 59&#8201;% C2+ selectivity and a 30&#8201;% CO conversion were obtained at the high GHSV of 12&#8201;000&#8197;mL&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1.

         <title>Synthesis of Efficient and Stable Tetrabutylammonium Copper Halides with Dual Emissions for Warm White Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A warm welcome for a WLED: The synthesis of single&#8208;component phosphor, tetrabutylammonium copper halides, with dual broad&#8208;band emission (494 and 654&#8197;nm), high photoluminescent (PL) quantum yield (93.7&#8201;%) and large Stokes shift (150&#8197;nm) is reported. The resulting diodes emitted white light with a high color rendering index of 89 and correlated color temperature (CCT) of 4516&#8197;K.







Abstract
In order to achieve a high color&#8208;rendering index (CRI) and low correlated color temperature (CCT) indoor lighting, single&#8208;component phosphors with broad&#8208;band dual emission are in high demand for white&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLEDs). However, phosphors with such fluorescent properties are rare at present. Herein, we report a facile solid&#8208;state chemical method for the synthesis of single&#8208;component phosphor with broad&#8208;band emission and a large Stokes shift that can meet the requirements of future white&#8208;light sources. These new tetrabutylammonium copper halides phosphors have excellent warm white emission characteristics, and their luminescence peaks are located at 494 and 654&#8197;nm. The optimized photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield can reach 93.7&#8201;%. The typical CIE coordinate of the as&#8208;fabricated WLED is at (0.3620, 0.3731) with a CRI of 89 and low CCT of 4516&#8197;K.

Isocyanide&#8208;based Multicomponent Reactions in a new light! A review about challenges, potentialities, new trends, and future directions of exploiting isocyanide unique reactivity features under visible light irradiation.







Abstract
Isocyanide&#8208;based multicomponent reactions claim a one century&#8208;old history of flourishing developments. On the other hand, the enormous impact of recent progresses in visible light photocatalysis has boosted the identification of new straightforward and green approaches to both new and known chemical entities. In this context, the application of visible light photocatalytic conditions to multicomponent processes has been promoting key stimulating advancements. Spanning from radical&#8208;polar crossover pathways, to photoinduced and self&#8208;catalyzed transformations, to reactions involving the generation of imidoyl radical species, the present literature analysis would provide a general and critical overview about the potentialities and challenges of exploiting isocyanides in visible light photocatalytic multicomponent reactions.

Primary resource: Hypervalent iodine&#8208;based aminating reagents containing a transferable (diarylmethylene)amino group can be used for the &#945;&#8208;amination of simple carbonyl compounds such as esters, amides, and ketones in the presence of a lithium base. The (diarylmethylene)amino groups of the products can be readily modified, thus providing access to primary amines and diarylmethylamines.







Abstract
Hypervalent iodine&#8208;based aminating reagents containing a transferable (diarylmethylene)amino group can be used for the &#945;&#8208;amination of simple carbonyl compounds such as esters, amides, and ketones in the presence of a lithium base. The (diarylmethylene)amino groups of the products can be readily modified, thus providing access to primary amines and diarylmethylamines. The developed method features transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions and a simple one&#8208;pot procedure without the need to prepare enolate equivalents separately, thus offering a general and practical approach to the synthesis of a wide variety of &#945;&#8208;amino carbonyl compounds. Experimental mechanistic investigations indicate that this amination proceeds through a unique radical coupling of an &#945;&#8208;carbonyl radical with an iminyl radical; they are generated through a single&#8208;electron transfer between a lithium enolate and the hypervalent iodine reagent.

         <title>Yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C Nanocomposites as a Heterogeneous Fenton&#8208;like Catalyst for Organic Dye Removal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MB and PMS are absorbed by the Fe3O4/C shell and subsequently diffuse into the interior cavity of the yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites. PMS enter the catalyst and interact with active sites on the shell and in the core. Co2+ and Fe2+ in the catalyst can activate PMS to generate SO4&#8901;&#8722;. Meanwhile, OH&#8722;/H2O will be oxidized by SO4&#8901;&#8722; to &#8901;OH, generating H+ while consuming OH&#8722;. SO4&#8901;&#8722;, &#8901;OH and 
, resulting from a typical chain reaction, will interact with MB and breakdown it to intermediates CO2 and H2O.







Abstract
The yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites with Co3O4 as the core, Fe3O4/C as the shell, and a cavity structure were synthesized by the hard template method. The physical and chemical properties of the composites were characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD, TGA, XPS, BET, and VSM. The specific surface area of yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites is 175.9&#8197;m2&#8197;g&#8722;1, showing superparamagnetic properties. The yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites were used as heterogeneous Fenton catalysts to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to degrade MB, which showed high catalytic degradation performance. The degradation rate of MB reached 100&#8201;% within 30&#8197;min under the circumstances of the yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites dosage of 0.1&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1, the PMS dosage of 1.0&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1, the initial MB concentration of 100&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1, an initial pH of 5.5, and a temperature of 30&#177;2&#8201;&#176;C. The enhanced catalytic performance of the yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the two catalytically active materials and the middle cavity. The effects of different operating parameters and co&#8208;existing anion species on MB degradation were also investigated. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis and quenching experiments confirmed that the formation of SO4&#8901;&#8722; in the yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C/PMS system contributes to MB degradation. In addition, yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites can be easily separated from the pollutant solution under the action of an external magnetic field, and the degradation rate of MB can still reach 98&#8201;% after five cycles, indicating that it has good stability and reusability and has broad application prospects in the field of water purification.

         <title>Confinement of Assemblies of Peptides by Chemical Reactions in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Confinement of peptide assemblies by chemical reactions in a specific location of living cells is a big challenge. This article introduces the peptide self&#8208;assembly triggered by chemical factors inside cancer cells, which could be helpful in designing functional materials selectively for cancer therapy, drug delivery, and biological imaging.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly of peptides plays an important role in optics, catalysis, medicine, and disease treatment. In recent years, peptide&#8208;based materials have exhibited great potential for cancer therapy and disease imaging due to their excellent biocompatibility, structural tenability, and ease of functionality. Peptides could self&#8208;assemble into diverse nanostructures in&#8197;vivo triggered by endogenous stimuli, which initiated chemical reactions and self&#8208;assembled to achieve desired biological functions in the tumor microenvironment. This concept introduces the utilization of endogenous triggers to construct functional nanostructures in&#8197;vivo and their corresponding biological applications. After briefly discussing the representative example of chemical reactions induced self&#8208;assembly of peptides in the living system, we describe the several stimuli triggered self&#8208;assembly for constructing therapeutic assemblies and serving as an imaging probe. Finally, we give a brief outlook to discuss the future direction of this exciting new field.

         <title>Ability of Azathiacyclen Ligands To Stop Cu(A&#946;)&#8208;Induced Production of Reactive Oxygen Species: [3N1S] Is the Right Donor Set</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Speedy silencer: Five 12&#8208;membered macrocycles ranging from the [4N] to the [1N3S] binding set were challenged for their ability to stop and prevent the formation of reactive oxygen species induced by the Cu(A&#946;) complex, where A&#946; is the Alzheimer&#8208;related peptide. The most appropriate ligand was [3N1S], which combines redox silencing of the copper ion with the speed of Cu removal from A&#946;.







Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disease that leads to the progressive and irreversible loss of mental functions. The amyloid beta (A&#946;) peptide involved in the disease is responsible for the production of damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) when bound to Cu ions. A therapeutic approach that consists of removing Cu ions from A&#946; to alter this deleterious interaction is currently being developed. In this context, we report the ability of five different 12&#8208;membered thiaazacyclen ligands to capture Cu from A&#946; and to redox silence it. We propose that the presence of a sole sulfur atom in the ligand increases the rate of Cu capture and removal from A&#946;, while the kinetic aspect of the chelation was an issue encountered with the 4N parent ligand. The best ligand for removing Cu from A&#946; and inhibiting the associated ROS production is the 1&#8208;thia&#8208;4,7,10&#8208;triazacyclododecane [3N1S]. Indeed the replacement of more N by S atoms makes the corresponding Cu complexes easier to reduce and thus able to produce ROS on their own. In addition, the ligand with three sulfur atoms has a weaker affinity for CuII than A&#946;, and is thus unable to remove Cu from CuA&#946;.

Four &#960;&#8208;extended phosphindolizine derivatives have been newly synthesized and characterized. We express these compounds as four hayabusa (falcons) that are taking off from a nest (shown lower right), which indicates the dibenzo[b,e]phosphindolizines reported previously. We also describe the weak luminescence of one compound (shown upper left) as shining under the sun. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Tsurusaki, K. Kamikawa, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203321). Artwork by Norifumi Kosaka of YAP Inc.

         <title>Promoting Photocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Reduction by Tuning the Properties of Cocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CRR) is an effective strategy because it affords the conversion of CO2 into useful carbon feedstocks by using sunlight and water. The Review by Y. Negishi and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203387) summarizes recent research and development trends in the improvement of cocatalysts, which have a significant impact on the catalytic activity and selectivity of photocatalytic CRR. This review could serve as a general guideline to accelerate the development of highly efficient CRR photocatalysts.

         <title>Dispersibility of TiO2 Nanoparticles in Less Polar Solvents: Role of Ligand Tail Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cover feature shows a schematic impression of our study on the dispersibility of TiO2 nanoparticles in less polar solvents. For ligand tail structures, there is a huge gap between saturated stearyl groups (depicted as waxes) and unsaturated oleyl groups (depicted as olives), even though there is very little difference in their molecular structures. In this study, we have synthesized two different ligands to bridge shores that are close yet far apart. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Okada and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203608).

         <title>The Effect of Mesogenic Coronas on the Type and Anisotropy of Gold Nanoparticle Superlattices: When Can the Tail Wag the Dog?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold nanoparticles coated with forked rod&#8208;like bimesogen ligands formed two close&#8208;packed 3D lattices, HCP and FCC. The former had partially oriented nematic&#8208;like mesogens. Geometric analysis of these and other superlattice structures produced rules to help design nanoparticle coronas giving rise to desired isotropic and anisotropic plasmonic superlattices.







Abstract
The correlation between the size of nanoparticles, the structure and shape of mesogenic ligands and the ensuing assembly behaviour is not really understood. Closer inspection shows very surprising features. Here, 2&#8208; and 4&#8208;nm gold nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized, and grafted with a forked ligand containing two rod&#8208;like mesogens in its branches: one cholesterol, the other with azobenzene. The 4&#8208;nm NPs also contained n&#8208;hexylthiol as co&#8208;ligand. They were found to form a FCC cubic superlattice, whereas the 2&#8208;nm NPs form hexagonal HCP with weak birefringence, hence with partially oriented ligands. The structures were compared with those of related systems containing a range of different azobenzene&#8208;to&#8208;cholesterol ratios, all giving body&#8208;centred tetragonal superlattices with various degrees of anisotropy. Geometric analysis is presented in terms of the asphericity of the NPs&#8217; surroundings, requirement for space&#8208;filling and structural anisotropy. Some general rules are derived to help design the soft corona around the NPs in order to obtain superlattices with the desired structure and anisotropy.

         <title>Triple Thorpe&#8211;Ingold Effect in the Synthesis of 18&#8208;Membered C3 Symmetric Lactams Stacking as Endless Supramolecular Tubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon slow injection of the linear H&#8722;[NH&#8722;CHR&#8722;CH2&#8722;CH=CH&#8722;CO]3&#8722;OPfp TFA salt precursors to a solution of NMM at room temperature, the corresponding macrocycles are formed in moderate to excellent yields when the R groups are hydrogen or larger substituents respectively. The resulting symmetric macrolactams stack as endless parallel nanotubes in crystals even when the R groups are increasingly bulky.







Abstract
Three C3 symmetric macrolactams were very efficiently cyclized from their linear precursors. Adequately located substituents are responsible for the enhancement of reactivity that is not observed in the unsubstituted parent. DFT calculations show that the properly folded cyclization precursor, the reactive conformer, is more populated than other conformers, leading to a decrease of free energy of activation. The crystal structure of the ring substituted with three very bulky esters indicates that tubular stacking is preserved.

         <title>Controlled Hydrolysis of Phosphate Esters: A Route to Calixarene&#8208;Supported Rare&#8208;Earth Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ln&#8208;based controlled hydrolysis in a phosphorylated&#8208;calix[4]arene results in the cleavage of three out of the eight P&#8722;OEt bonds, forming a hydrolyzed phosphoryl&#8208;calix[4]arene ligand (H3LHPO). The chelating nature of H3LHPO traps the LnIII species in the form of [LnIII(LHPO)((EtO)2P(O)OH)]2 (Ln=La, Dy, Tb, Gd), with the Dy derivative showing slow relaxation of the magnetization.







Abstract
Phosphate ester bonds are widely present in nature (e.&#8201;g. DNA/RNA) and can be extremely stable against hydrolysis without the help of catalysts. Previously, we showed how the combination of phosphoryl and calix[4]arene moieties in the same organic framework (LPO) allows isolation of single lanthanide (Ln) metal ions as [LnIII(LPO)2](O3SCF3)3. Here we report how by controlling the reaction conditions a new hydrolyzed phosphoryl&#8208;calix[4]arene ligand (H3LHPO) is formed as a result of LnIII&#8208;mediated P&#8211;OEt bond cleavage in three out of the eight possible sites in LPO. The chelating nature of H3LHPO traps the LnIII species in the form of [LnIII(LHPO)((EtO)2P(O)OH)]2 dimers (Ln=La, Dy, Tb, Gd), where the Dy derivative shows slow magnetization relaxation. The strategy presented herein could be extended to access a broader library of hydrolyzed platforms (HxLHPO; x=1&#8211;8) that may represent mimics of nuclease enzymes.

         <title>AuNP&#8208;Modulated qPCR: An Optimized System for Detecting MIR Biophotons Released in DNA Replication</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ATP, the cell energy currency mostly produced by mitochondria, is conventionally regarded as releasing heat to drive biological reactions and processes. By employing dNTPs (i.&#8201;e., energy molecules that have an identical way of storing/releasing energy to ATP), we demonstrated that ATP hydrolysis can release photons with a specific mid&#8208;infrared frequency to efficiently drive DNA replication. More information can be found in the Research Article by L. Jiang, B. Song, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203513).

         <title>Dioxygen Binding is Controlled by the Protein Environment in Non&#8208;Heme Fe(II) and 2&#8208;Oxoglutarate Oxygenases &#8211; A Study on Histone Demethylase PHF8 and an Ethylene Forming Enzyme</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study investigates dioxygen binding and 2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG) coordination by two model non&#8208;heme Fe(II)/2OG enzymes: a class 7 histone demethylase (PHF8) that catalyzes the hydroxylation of its H3K9me2 histone substrate leading to demethylation reactivity and the ethylene&#8208;forming enzyme (EFE) that catalyzes two competing reactions of ethylene generation and substrate L&#8208;Arg hydroxylation. Although both enzymes initially bind 2OG using an off&#8208;line 2OG coordination mode, in PHF8, the substrate oxidation requires a transition to an in&#8208;line mode, whereas EFE is catalytically productive for ethylene production from 2OG via the off&#8208;line mode. We utilized classical molecular dynamics, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) MD and QM/MM metadynamics simulations to reveal that it is the dioxygen binding process and, ultimately, the protein environment that control the formation of the in&#8208;line Fe(III)&#8208;OO&#8208;. intermediate in PHF8 and the off&#8208;line Fe(III)&#8208;OO&#8208;. intermediate in EFE.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Hydrogen Bonds with Different Binding Modes: the Acceptor &#8220;Rules&#8221; but the Donor &#8220;Chooses&#8221;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This computational work studies the different hydrogen bond (HB) binding modes that can be established between neighbouring HB donors and acceptors in structures with relevance in catalysis and biology. To analyse the electronic effect on the s&#8208;hole, HB donors unsubstituted and with two different substituents, an electron withdrawing (EWG), and an electron donating (EDG) group, were studied. Upon complexation, three different binding modes were observed: bifurcated, parallel, and zigzag. It was found that, as a general trend, HBs within parallel pattern are the strongest followed by those within bifurcated and zigzag binding modes, leading to a &#8216;competition&#8217; between the last two. &#160;Similar patterns and trends have been found in experimental structures found in a search within the CSCD. In conclusion, even though the HB acceptors &#8220;rule&#8221; the pattern and strength of the HB interactions within the dimers, when there is an option for different binding modes within a particular dimer, the HB donors &#8220;choose&#8221; the type of binding established.</dc:description>

         <title>Preparation of ropivacaine encapsulated by zeolite imidazole framework microspheres as sustained&#8208;release system and efficacy evaluation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The management of persistent postoperative pain still remains a clinical challenge currently. Although ropivacaine (RVC) is widely used for postoperative analgesia as a local anesthetic, the short half&#8208;life makes it difficult to achieve the desired duration of analgesia.&#160;Herein, a novel RVC sustained&#8208;release microspheres encapsulated by zeolite imidazole framework&#8208;8 (RVC@ZIF&#8208;8) was synthesized for the first time, which prolonged the sustained&#8208;release of RVC and decreased the resulting drug toxicity.&#160;RVC can continuously release in vitro for at least 96 h with high drug loading of 30.6% and RVC@ZIF&#8208;8 had excellent biocompatibility and low cytotoxicity.&#160;In sciatic nerve block model, the sensory block time of RVC@ZIF&#8208;8 was significantly prolonged&#160;compared with RVC,&#160;achieving more than 72 h post injection and no inflammation or lesion were found. Based on high drug loading, ideal sustained&#8208;release and superior biological safety, RVC@ZIF&#8208;8 will be a novel delivery material for local anesthetic with potential application.</dc:description>

         <title>Evaluation by Experimentation and Simulation of a FRET Pair Comprising Fluorescent Nucleobase Analogs in Nucleosomes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is an attractive tool for understanding biomolecular dynamics. FRET&#8208;based analysis of nucleosomes has the potential to fill the knowledge gaps between static structures and dynamic cellular behaviors. Compared with typical FRET pair using bulky fluorophores introduced by flexible linkers, fluorescent nucleoside&#8208;based FRET pair has great potential since it can be fitted within the helical structures of nucleic acids. &#160;Herein we report on the construction of nucleosomes containing a nucleobase FRET pair and the investigation of experimental and theoretical FRET efficiencies through steady&#8208;state fluorescence spectroscopy and calculation based on molecular dynamics simulations, respectively. Distinguishable experimental FRET efficiencies were observed depending on the positions of FRET pairs in nucleosomal DNA. The tendency could be supported by theoretical study. This work suggests the possibility of our approach to analyze structural changes of nucleosomes by epigenetic modifications or internucleosomal interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Chelation of the Exotic Meitner&#8208;Auger Emitter Mercury&#8208;197m/g with Sulfur&#8208;rich Macrocyclic Ligands: Towards the Future of Theranostic Radiopharmaceuticals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mercury&#8208;197m/g are a promising pair of radioactive isomers for incorporation into a theranostic as they can be used as a diagnostic agent using SPECT imaging and a therapeutic via Meitner&#8208;Auger electron emissions. However, the current absence of ligands able to stably coordinate 197m/gHg to a tumour&#8208;targeting vector precludes their use in vivo. To address this, we report herein a series of sulfur&#8208;rich chelators capable of incorporating 197m/gHg into a radiopharmaceutical. 1,4,7,10&#8208;Tetrathia&#8208;13&#8208;azacyclopentadecane (NS4) and its derivatives, (2&#8208;(1,4,7,10&#8208;tetrathia&#8208;13&#8208;azacyclopentadecan&#8208;13&#8208;yl)acetic acid (NS4&#8208;CA) and N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;2&#8208;(1,4,7,10&#8208;tetrathia&#8208;13&#8208;azacyclopentadecan&#8208;13&#8208;yl)acetamide (NS4&#8208;BA), were designed, synthesized and analyzed for their ability to coordinate Hg2+ through a combination of theoretical (DFT) and experimental coordination chemistry studies (NMR and mass spectrometry) as well as 197m/gHg radiolabeling studies and in vitro stability assays. The development of stable ligands for 197m/gHg reported herein is extremely impactful as it would enable its use for in vivo imaging and therapy, leading to personalized treatments for cancer.</dc:description>

         <title>Conversion of Ketones into Blue&#8208;emitting Electron&#8208;deficient Benzofurans</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel heavy metal&#8208;free and safe synthetic methodology enabling one&#8208;step conversion of ketones into corresponding 4,5,6,7&#8208;tetrafluorobenzofurans (F4BFs) has been developed. The presented approach has numerous advantageous qualities, including utilization of readily available substrates, broad scope, scalability, and good reaction yields. Importantly, some of the benzofurans prepared by this method were heretofore inaccessible by any other known transformation. Importantly, furo[2,3&#8208;b]pyrazines and heretofore unexplored difuro[2,3&#8208;c:3',2'&#8208;e]pyridazine can be prepared using this strategy. Spectroscopic studies reveal that for simple systems, absorption and fluorescence maxima fall within the UV spectral range, while &#960;&#8208;electron system expansion red&#8208;shifts both spectra. Moreover, the good fluorescence quantum yields observed in solution, up to 96%, are also maintained in the solid state. Experimental results are supported by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The presented methodology, combined with the spectroscopic characteristics, suggest the possibility of using F4BFs in the optoelectronic industry (i.e. Organic Light Emitting Devices (OLED), Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors (OFET), Organic Photovoltaics (OPV)) as inexpensive and readily available emissive or semiconductor materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of zigzag&#8208;edged polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (Z1&#8208;Z3) were synthesized from 2,12&#8208;dibromo&#8208;7,14&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;benzo[m]tetraphene (9) as a versatile building block. Their structures were unambiguously confirmed by laser desorption/ionization time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometry, 1H NMR, Raman, and Fourier&#8208;transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopies as well as scanning tunneling microscopy. The fingerprint vibrational modes were elucidated with theoretical support. The edge&#8208; and size&#8208;dependent optical properties were characterized by UV&#8208;Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Moreover, ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy revealed distinct modulation of the photophysical properties upon &#960;&#8208;extension from Z1 to Z2, the latter having a gulf edge.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and characterization of a masked terminal nickel&#8208;oxide complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In exploring terminal nickel&#8208;oxo complexes, postulated to be the active oxidant in natural and non&#8208;natural oxidation reactions, we report the synthesis of the pseudo&#8208;trigonal bipyramidal NiII complexes (K)[NiII(LPh)(DMF)] (1[DMF]) and (NMe4)2[NiII(LPh)(OAc)] (1[OAc]) (LPh = 2,2',2''&#8208;nitrilo&#8208;tris&#8208;(N&#8208;phenylacetamide; DMF = N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide; &#8211;OAc = acetate)). Both complexes were characterized using NMR, FT&#8208;IR, ESI&#8208;MS, and X&#8208;ray crystallography, showing the LPh ligand to bind in a tetradentate fashion, together with an ancillary donor. The reaction of 1[OAc] with peroxyphenyl acetic acid (PPAA) resulted in the formation of [(LPh)NiIII&#8211;O&#8211;H&#183;&#183;&#183;OAc]2&#8211;, 2, that displays many of the characteristics of a terminal Ni=O species. 2 was characterized by UV&#8208;Vis, EPR, and XAS spectroscopies and ESI&#8208;MS. 2 decayed to yield a NiII&#8208;phenolate complex 3 (through aromatic electrophilic substitution) that was characterized by NMR, FT&#8208;IR, ESI&#8208;MS, and X&#8208;ray crystallography. 2 was capable of hydroxylation of hydrocarbons and epoxidation of olefins, as well as oxygen atom transfer oxidation of phosphines at exceptional rates. While the oxo&#8208;wall remains standing, this complex represents an excellent example of a masked metal&#8208;oxide that displays all of the properties expected of the ever elusive terminal M=O beyond the oxo&#8208;wall.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The first organocatalytic, non&#8208;destructive desymmetrisation of 3&#8208;substituted cyclobutanone followed by intramolecular cyclisation has been described. Owing to the slow activation of pro&#8208;nucleophile by the weak Br&#248;nsted base, the &#945;&#8208;functionalization of ketones with tertiary amine&#8208;derived Br&#248;nsted base catalysis has been chemically challenging in asymmetric transformations. Herein, we demonstrate the cinchona&#8208;derived squaramide catalyst works effectively for the intramolecular Michael addition of cyclobutanone to enones and affords the architecturally fascinating [6,5,4]&#8208;fused carbocyclic skeleton in good yields and excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;20:1 dr and 96% ee).

         <title>Progresses of in situ H2O2 generation and corresponding pollutant removal applications: a review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation from oxygen and water enables a sustainable environment to operate in an effective and green energy&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion way, which has attracted increasing interest in the fields of energy production and environment treatment.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;healable and stretchable elastomeric material is essential for the development of flexible electronics devices to ensure their stable performance. In this study, a strain sensor (PIH2T1&#8208;tri/CNT) composed of self&#8208;repairable crosslinked elastomer substrate (PIH2T1&#8208;tri, containing multiple reversible repairing sites such as disulfide, imine, and hydrogen bonds) and conductive layer (carbon nanotube, CNT) was prepared. The PIH2T1&#8208;tri elastomer had excellent self&#8208;healing ability (healing efficiency = 91%). It exhibited good mechanical integrity in terms of elongation at break (672%), tensile strength (1.41 MPa). The Young&#8217;s modulus (0.39 MPa) was close to that of human skin. The PIH2T1&#8208;tri/CNT sensor also demonstrated effective self&#8208;healing function for electrical conduction and sensing property. Meanwhile, it had high sensitivity (gauge factor (GF) = 24.1), short response time (120 ms), and long&#8208;term durability (4000 cycles). This study offers a novel self&#8208;healable elastomer platform with carbon based conductive components to develop flexible strain sensors towards high performance soft electronics.</dc:description>

With RGD peptidomimetics straight to the target: Improving the conjugation strategy of small molecular integrin ligands increases cancer targeting and cytotoxicity of small molecule drug conjugates addressing integrin &#945;V&#946;3 expressing melanoma cells.







Abstract
Small molecule&#8208;drug conjugates (SMDCs) mimicking the RGD sequence (&#8208;Arg&#8208;Gly&#8208;Asp&#8208;) with a non&#8208;peptide moiety require a pharmacophore&#8208;independent attachment site. A library of 36 sulfonamide&#8208;modified RGD mimetics with nM to pM affinity for integrin &#945;V&#946;3 was synthesized and analysed via DAD mapping. The best structure of the conjugable RGD mimetic was used and a linker was attached to an aromatic ring by Negishi cross&#8208;coupling. The product retained high affinity and selectivity for integrin &#945;V&#946;3. The conjugable RGD mimetic was then attached to an enzymatically cleavable GKGEVA linker equipped with a self&#8208;immolative PABC and the antimitotic drug monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). The resulting SMDC preferred binding to integrin &#945;V&#946;3 over &#945;5&#946;1 in a ratio of 1&#8201;:&#8201;4519 (ELISA) and showed selectivity for &#945;V&#946;3&#8208;positive WM115 cells over &#945;V&#946;3&#8208;negative M21&#8208;L cells in the in&#8197;vitro cell adhesion assay as well as in cell viability assays with a targeting index of 134 (M21&#8208;L/WM115).

         <title>New Fields, New Opportunities and New Challenges: Circularly Polarized Multiple Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy, namely CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF, is proposed to generate organic emitters with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity, thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), and narrowband emission, by merging the CPL optical property and multiple resonance (MR) induced TADF characteristic into one molecule. This approach is propitious to the direct realization of 3D and wide color gamut display applications in the future.







Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials that concurrently exhibit high efficiency and narrowband emission are extremely promising applications in 3D and wide color gamut display. By merging the CPL optical property and multiple resonance (MR) induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) characteristic into one molecule, a new strategy, namely CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF, is proposed to generate organic emitters with CPL activity, TADF and narrowband emission. High&#8208;performance red, green and blue CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF emitters have been developed following this strategy. Herein, the present status and progress of CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF materials in the field of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) is summarized. Finally, for this rapidly growing new research field, the future opportunities are forecasted and the present challenges are discussed.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Multifunctional Bioreducible Polymers for mRNA Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ring opening polymerization of active ester&#8208;containing lipoic acid monomers generated poly(active ester)disulfide polymers. Mild and controlled aminolysis of poly(active ester)disulfides yields multifunctional polymers bearing cationic, ionizable, and hydrophobic derivatives. Combining multifunctional polymers with mRNA yields distinct nanoparticles that are capable delivering EGFP and OVA mRNA to dendritic cells in&#8197;vitro.







Abstract
Bioreducible polymeric mRNA carriers are an emerging family of vectors for gene delivery and vaccine development. A few bioreducible systems have been generated through aqueous&#8208;phase ring&#8208;opening polymerization of lipoic acid derivatives, however this methodology limits hydrophobic group incorporation and functionality into resulting polymers. Herein, a poly(active ester)disulfide polymer is synthesized that can undergo facile aminolysis with amine&#8208;containing substrates under stoichiometric control and mild reaction conditions to yield a library of multifunctional polydisulfide polymers. Functionalized polydisulfide polymer species form stable mRNA&#8208;polymer nanoparticles for intracellular delivery of mRNAs in&#8197;vitro. Alkyl&#8208;functionalized polydisulfide&#8208;RNA nanoparticles demonstrate rapid cellular uptake and excellent biodegradability when delivering EGFP and OVA mRNAs to cells in&#8197;vitro. This streamlined polydisulfide synthesis provides a new facile methodology for accessing multifunctional bioreducible polymers as biomaterials for RNA delivery and other applications.

         <title>TEMPO&#8208;Modified Polymethacrylates as Mediators in Electrosynthesis: Influence of the Molecular Weight on Redox Properties and Electrocatalytic Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The polymeric electrosynthesis mediators: Polymediators are soluble redox&#8208;active polymers applicable as catalysts in electrosynthesis. Their difference in size relative to typical product molecules enables recovery by dialysis or membrane filtration. Using anodic alcohol oxidation as an example, the relationship between the molecular weight of TEMPO&#8208;modified polymethacrylates and their catalytic properties was elaborated using cyclic voltammetry and preparative&#8208;scale electrolysis.







Abstract
Homogeneous catalysts (&#8220;mediators&#8221;) are frequently employed in organic electrosynthesis to control selectivity. Despite their advantages, they can have a negative influence on the overall energy and mass balance if used only once or recycled inefficiently. Polymediators are soluble redox&#8208;active polymers applicable as electrocatalysts, enabling recovery by dialysis or membrane filtration. Using anodic alcohol oxidation as an example, we have demonstrated that TEMPO&#8208;modified polymethacrylates (TPMA) can act as efficient and recyclable catalysts. In the present work, the influence of the molecular size on the redox properties and the catalytic activity was carefully elaborated using a series of TPMAs with well&#8208;defined molecular weight distributions. Cyclic voltammetry studies show that the polymer chain length has a pronounced impact on the key&#8208;properties. Together with preparative&#8208;scale electrolysis experiments, an optimum size range was identified for polymediator&#8208;guided sustainable reaction control.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homogeneous catalysts (&#8220;mediators&#8221;) are frequently employed in organic electrosynthesis to control selectivity. Despite their advantages, they can have a negative influence on the overall energy and mass balance if used only once or recycled inefficiently. Polymediators are soluble redox-active polymers applicable as electrocatalysts, enabling recovery by dialysis or membrane filtration. Using anodic alcohol oxidation as an example, we have demonstrated that TEMPO-modified polymethacrylates (TPMA) can act as efficient and recyclable catalysts. In the present work, the influence of the molecular size on the redox properties and the catalytic activity was carefully elaborated using a series of TPMAs with well-defined molecular weight distributions. Cyclic voltammetry studies show that the polymer chain length has a pronounced impact on the key-properties. Together with preparative-scale electrolysis experiments, an optimum size range was identified for polymediator-guided sustainable reaction control.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Crystal Structure of a New RTH&#8208;Type Precursor and Its Interlayer Expanded Zeolite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new RTH layer zeolite L was synthesized and converted into RTH topology upon calcination. The IEZ&#8208;RTH zeolite was formed by modification with the silylation agent diethoxydimethylsilane under acidic conditions. The new zeolites have a large specific surface area of 552&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 188&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively.







Abstract
Two dimensional zeolites have drawn a lot of attention due to their structural diversity and chemical composition, which can be used to obtain 3D zeolites, for which there is no direct synthesis. Here, a new layer silicate zeolite L was synthesized using the N, N&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;(2&#8208;methyl)&#8208;benzimidazolium as the organic structure&#8208;directing agent (OSDA) in the presence of fluoride. Structure determination by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals that the pure silica precursor with five&#8208;ring pores in the crystalline sheets is composed of the rth layer stacking along the (001) direction in an &#8230;AAAA&#8230; sequence with SDA+ cations and F&#8722; residing within the interlayer spaces. Variable temperature powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) results showed that the new layer could transform into a 3D RTH topology structure at 350&#8201;&#176;C via 2D&#8208;3D topotactic transformation. Furthermore, a new 3D zeolite material is obtained by treating the original layer with a diethoxydimethylsilane agent under hydrochloric acid condition (HCl&#8722;DEDMS). Based on the PXRD results and the original layer structure, the new 3D zeolite structure expanding the rth layer with another Si atom is constructed, which possesses a 10&#215;8&#215;6 channel system. It displays a high BET surface area of 188&#8197;cm3/g with an external surface area of 130&#8197;cm3/g. The structure and textural properties pave a way for potential catalytic applications. The research not only provides a new layered zeolite, broadening the 2D zeolite framework types, but also allows for the discovery of a new stable 3D zeolite expanding the RTH structure with Si atom, which hasn't been reported yet.

         <title>Diastereoselectivity Switch During Alkene Reductions: Diastereodivergent Syntheses of Molecular Fossils via MHAT or Homogeneous Catalytic Hydrogenation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sixteen geosteranes were synthesized in up to 57% overall yields in four steps harnessing the olefin cross&#8208;metathesis (OCM) and Metal hydride H atom transfer (MHAT) or homogeneous hydrogenation reactions as key steps. Drawing on this strategy, the diastereomeric ratio (d.r.) reached up to 24:1 for the thermodynamic isomer and 7:1 for the other isomer in the hydrogenation step. In a geological sample from northeast Brazil, we confirmed the putative structures previously assumed as methyl 2&#8208;(3&#945;&#8208;5&#945;H&#8208;cholestan)acetate (3Aa), methyl 2&#8208;(3&#946;&#8208;5&#945;H&#8208;cholestan)acetate (3Ba), and methyl 6&#8208;(3&#946;&#8208;5&#945;H&#8208;cholestan)hexanoate (3Bc), as well three new molecular fossils of approximately 120 million years old. We also proved the migration marking ability of those geosteranes during an oil migration event, which suggests their aptitudes as molecular odometers. Our approach demonstrated swiftness and effectiveness in preparing a molecular library of geological biomarkers would also be appropriate to generate stereochemical diversity in molecular libraries for medicinal chemistry and natural product anticipation.</dc:description>

         <title>C vs. O Protonation in Zincate Anions: A Simple Gas&#8208;Phase Model for the Surprising Kinetic Stability of Organometallics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For better understanding the intrinsic reactivity of organozinc reagents, we have examined the protolysis of the isolated zincate ions Et3Zn&#8722;, Et2Zn(OH)&#8722;, and Et2Zn(OH)2Li&#8722; by 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethanol in the gas phase. The protonation of the hydroxy groups and the release of water proceed much more efficiently than the protonation of the ethyl groups and the liberation of ethane. Quantum&#8208;chemical computations and statistical&#8208;rate theory calculations fully reproduce the experimental findings and attribute the lower reactivity of the more basic ethyl moiety to higher intrinsic barriers, which override the thermodynamic preference for its protonation. Thus, our minimalistic gas&#8208;phase model provides evidence for the intrinsically low reactivity of organozinc reagents toward proton donors and helps to explain their remarkable kinetic stability against moisture and even protic media.</dc:description>

         <title>Red Shift in Optical Excitations on Layered Copper Perovskites under Pressure: Role of the Orthorhombic Instability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 5, January 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By first principles calculations, the behaviour under pressure of the structure and optical transitions of (C2H5NH3)CdCl4:Cu2+ layered system versus two Jahn&#8208;Teller (JT) systems, CdCl2:Cu2+ and NaCl:Cu2+ is explored. The last two systems come from a parent phase where CuCl64&#8722; complexes have orbital degeneracy and thus suffer a JT instability. In contrast, there is no degeneracy in the parent phase of the layered system, which undergoes an orthorhombic instability connected with the red shift under pressure.







Abstract
The red shift under pressure in optical transitions of layered compounds with CuCl64&#8722; units is explored through first&#8208;principles calculations and the analysis of available experimental data. The results on Cu2+&#8208;doped (C2H5NH3)2CdCl4, that is taken as a guide, show the existence of a highly anisotropic response to pressure related to a structural instability, driven by a negative force constant, that leads to an orthorhombic geometry of CuCl64&#8722; units but with a hole displaying a dominant 3z2&#8208;r2 character (z being the direction perpendicular to the layer plane). As a result of such an instability, a pressure of only 3&#8197;GPa reduces by 0.21&#8197;&#197; the longest Cu2+&#8208;Cl&#8722; distance, lying in the layer plane, while leaving unmodified the two other metal&#8208;ligand distances. Owing to this fact, it is shown that the lowest d&#8208;d transition would experience a red shift of 0.34&#8197;eV while the first allowed charge transfer transition is also found to be red shifted but only by 0.11&#8197;eV that reasonably concurs with the experimental value. The parallel study on Jahn&#8208;Teller systems CdCl2:Cu2+ and NaCl:Cu2+ involving tetragonal elongated CuCl64&#8722; units shows that the reduction of the long axis by a pressure of 3&#8197;GPa is three times smaller than that for the layered (C2H5NH3)2CdCl4:Cu2+ compound. Accordingly, the optical transitions of such systems, which involve a positive force constant, are much less sensitive to pressure than in layered compounds. The origin of the red shift under pressure undergone by the lowest d&#8208;d and charge transfer transitions of (C2H5NH3)2CdCl4:Cu2+ is discussed in detail.

The results on Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-doped (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CdCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, that is taken as a guide, show the existence of a highly anisotropic response to pressure related to a structural instability, driven by a negative force constant, that leads to an orthorhombic geometry of CuCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; units but with a hole displaying a dominant 3z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; character (z being the direction perpendicular to the layer plane). As a result of such an instability, a pressure of only 3&#8197;GPa reduces by 0.21&#8197;&#197; the longest Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; distance, lying in the layer plane, while leaving unmodified the two other metal-ligand distances. Owing to this fact, it is shown that the lowest &lt;i&gt;d-d&lt;/i&gt; transition would experience a red shift of 0.34&#8197;eV while the first allowed charge transfer transition is also found to be red shifted but only by 0.11&#8197;eV that reasonably concurs with the experimental value. The parallel study on Jahn-Teller systems CdCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and NaCl:Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; involving tetragonal elongated CuCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; units shows that the reduction of the long axis by a pressure of 3&#8197;GPa is three times smaller than that for the layered (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CdCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;:Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; compound. Accordingly, the optical transitions of such systems, which involve a positive force constant, are much less sensitive to pressure than in layered compounds. The origin of the red shift under pressure undergone by the lowest &lt;i&gt;d-d&lt;/i&gt; and charge transfer transitions of (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CdCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;:Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is discussed in detail.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Challenges and Opportunities of Transition Metal Oxides as Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 5, January 24, 2023. </description>

Improving TMOs: The search for transition metal oxide (TMO) electrocatalysts is important but challenging. TMO electrocatalysts have the advantage of low cost, but also inherent disadvantages, such as poor electron conductivity. To meet industrial demands, better TMOs need to be identified by extensive searching, catalyst design, and structural engineering.







Abstract
As a sustainable energy technology, electrocatalytic energy conversion and storage has become increasingly prominent. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) are the key steps in the industrial applications of energy conversion and storage. Compared to the widely used precious metal catalysts, less&#8208;noble transition metal oxides (TMOs) and TMO&#8208;like materials have attracted broad attention as electrocatalysts in the above reactions. In this concept, we summarize the challenges and opportunities of some typical TMOs in electrocatalysis, and modification strategies of TMOs as electrocatalysts are discussed.

         <title>Rapid 18F&#8208; and 19F&#8208;Difluoromethylation through Desulfurative Fluorination of Transient N&#8208;, O&#8208;, and C&#8208;Linked Dithioles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 5, January 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
New opportunities for radiochemists: The AgF&#8208;promoted desulfurative fluorination of dithioles can lead to difluoromethylation. DMBDT&#8208;BF4 and DMBDT&#8208;OMe were identified as readily available and versatile reagents for the functionalization of alcohols and heterocycles during which DMBDT undergoes rapid desulfurative fluorination. Furthermore, Ag18F can be used to incorporate radioactive groups into structurally complex and pharmaceutically relevant molecules.







Abstract
The difluoromethyl group plays an important role in modern medicinal and agrochemistry. While several difluoromethylation reagents have been reported, these typically rely on difluoromethyl carbenes or anions, or target specific processes. Here, we describe a conceptually unique and general process for O&#8722;H, N&#8722;H and C&#8722;H difluoromethylation that involves the formation of a transient dithiole followed by facile desulfurative fluorination using silver(I) fluoride. We also introduce the 5,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;benzodithiole (DMBDT) function, which undergoes sufficiently rapid desulfurative fluorination to additionally support 18F&#8208;difluoromethylation. This new process is compatible with the wide range of functional groups typically encountered in medicinal chemistry campaigns, and the use of Ag18F is demonstrated in the production of 18F&#8208;labeled derivatives of testosterone, perphenazine, and melatonin, 58.0&#177;2.2, 20.4&#177;0.3 and 32.2&#177;3.6&#8197;MBq&#8201;&#956;mol&#8722;1, respectively. We expect that the DMBDT group and this 18F/19F&#8208;difluoromethylation process will inspire and support new efforts in medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry and radiotracer production.

         <title>Tuning the Mechanism of H/D Exchange for Isobutane on H&#8208;BEA by Loading Zn Species in Zeolite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 5, January 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Loading of zinc species in the form of either cations or oxide clusters into zeolite H&#8208;BEA provide the tuning effect on the H/D hydrogen exchange between deuterated isobutane&#8208;d10 and Br&#248;nsted acid sites of the zeolite resulting in the change of the indirect reaction mechanism via olefin intermediate to the mechanism of the direct exchange with the assistance of Zn species.







Abstract
Kinetics of H/D hydrogen exchange between deuterated isobutane&#8208;d10 and Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS) of three zeolite samples (H&#8208;BEA, ZnO/H&#8208;BEA, Zn2+/H&#8208;BEA) were monitored with 1H MAS NMR in&#8197;situ at 343&#8211;468&#8197;K. The regioselective H/D exchange in the methyl groups detected on H&#8208;BEA can be rationalized in terms of the mechanism of indirect exchange, which involves protonation of the intermediate olefin and further hydride abstraction from the other alkane molecule by the formed carbenium ion. Loading of Zn species in the zeolite results in a decrease of the rate and an increase of the activation energy of the exchange. The loaded Zn species provide the tuning effect on the reaction occurrence, changing the mechanism from the indirect one to the mechanism of the direct exchange.

The synthesis and structural characterization of the perhalogenated pyridinium cations [C5F5NH]+ and [C5F4ClNH]+ and the dimeric cations [(C5F5N)2H]+ and [(C5Cl5N)2H]+ as [Al(OTeF5)4]&#8722; salts are presented.

Abstract
The synthesis and the first structural characterization of the halogenated pyridinium salts [C5F5NH]+, [C5F4ClNH]+, [(C5F5N)2H]+, [(C5Cl5N)2H]+ of the weakly coordinating anion (WCA) [Al(OTeF5)4]&#8722;, showing noncovalent interactions in the solid state, are presented. The salts were characterized by the multinuclear NMR and IR spectroscopy as well as X&#8208;ray diffraction. Hirshfeld surface analysis and solid state structures reveal various intermolecular anion&#8208;&#960; and &#963;&#8208;hole interactions between the corresponding halogenated pyridinium cations and the anion [Al(OTeF5)4]&#8722;.

&lt;p&gt;The synthesis and the first structural characterization of the halogenated pyridinium salts [C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;NH]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;ClNH]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;N)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;N)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; of the weakly coordinating anion (WCA) [Al(OTeF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, showing noncovalent interactions in the solid state, are presented. The salts were characterized by the multinuclear NMR and IR spectroscopy as well as X-ray diffraction. Hirshfeld surface analysis and solid state structures reveal various intermolecular anion-&#960; and &#963;-hole interactions between the corresponding halogenated pyridinium cations and the anion [Al(OTeF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of an Antimicrobial Enterobactin&#8208;Muraymycin Conjugate for Improved Activity Against Gram&#8208;Negative Bacteria</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 5, January 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a thiol&#8208;containing muraymycin analogue and its use in an antimicrobial muraymycin&#8208;enterobactin conjugate with an intracellularly cleavable disulfide linker is reported. This conjugation approach was shown to increase antimicrobial activity against an efflux&#8208;deficient E. coli strain.







Abstract
Overcoming increasing antibiotic resistance requires the development of novel antibacterial agents that address new targets in bacterial cells. Naturally occurring nucleoside antibiotics (such as muraymycins) inhibit the bacterial membrane protein MraY, a clinically unexploited essential enzyme in peptidoglycan (cell wall) biosynthesis. Even though a range of synthetic muraymycin analogues has already been reported, they generally suffer from limited cellular uptake and a lack of activity against Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. We herein report an approach to overcome these hurdles: a synthetic muraymycin analogue has been conjugated to a siderophore, i.&#8201;e. the enterobactin derivative EntKL, to increase the cellular uptake into Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. The resultant conjugate showed significantly improved antibacterial activity against an efflux&#8208;deficient E. coli strain, thus providing a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of this novel approach and a starting point for the future optimisation of such conjugates towards potent agents against Gram&#8208;negative pathogens.

Coated flakes: Mn&#8208;coordinated N&#8208;aligned 3D graphene&#8208;like flakes&#8208;coated carbon rods are self&#8208;grown catalyzed by Mn. The obtained catalysts exhibit high oxygen&#8208;reduction reaction electrocatalytic performance in alkaline media.







Abstract
The in situ self&#8208;catalyzed growth of manganese&#8208;embedded 3D flakes&#8208;coated carbon rods (GFC) as an efficient oxygen&#8208;reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst of Zinc&#8208;air batteries is described for the first time. By optimizing the amount of Mn in the precursor, a series of 3D graphene&#8208;like flakes&#8208;coated carbon rods were synthesized. GFC with a doping amount of Mn of 10&#8201;% (GFC&#8208;10) exhibits excellent ORR performance with an onset potential of 0.94&#8197;V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode). The Zinc&#8208;air battery is constructed with GFC&#8208;10 as the cathode catalyst, and it exhibits a peak power density of 128.9&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a cycling stability of 75&#8197;h at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which are superior to the commercial 20&#8197;wt% Pt/C&#8208;based Zinc&#8208;air battery. Interestingly, the introduction of Mn facilitates the self&#8208;catalyzed growth of carbon rods, and the change of Mn amount can effectively regulate the morphology of materials. The improved ORR performance of the catalyst is ascribed to the synergistic effect of unique hierarchical porous structure, high&#8208;charge transport capacity, abundant carbon defects/edges and Mn&#8208;Nx sites. This research provides a new avenue to fabricating highly active Mn&#8208;based electrocatalysts for renewable energy systems.

         <title>NMR Investigation of Protein&#8208;Carbohydrate Interactions: The Recognition of Glycans by Galectins Engineered with Fluorotryptophan Residues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 5, January 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of single&#8208;19F&#8208;tryptophan residues into two glycan binding proteins, Galectin&#8208;3 and Galectin&#8208;8, was exploited to monitor their binding to carbohydrate ligands by using NMR spectroscopy. Although the affinity of the molecular recognition events was not substantially altered, 19F&#8197;NMR spectroscopy provided interesting added values with respect to other NMR binding strategies.







Abstract
Fluorine (19F) incorporation into glycan&#8208;binding proteins (lectins) has been achieved and exploited to monitor the binding to carbohydrate ligands by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Galectins are a family of lectins that bind carbohydrates, generally with weak affinities, through a combination of intermolecular interactions including a key CH&#8208;&#960; stacking involving a conserved tryptophan residue. Herein, Galectin&#8208;3 (Gal3) and Galectin&#8208;8 (Gal8) with one and two carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs), respectively, were selected. Gal3 contains one Trp, whereas Gal8 contains three, one at each binding site and a third one not involved in sugar binding; these were substituted by the corresponding F&#8208;Trp analogues. The presence of fluorine did not significantly modify the affinity for glycan binding, which was in slow exchange on the 19F NMR chemical&#8208;shift timescale, even for weak ligands, and allowed binding events taking place at two different binding sites within the same lectin to be individualized.

         <title>Synthesis, Post&#8208;Functionalization and Properties of Diphosphapentaarenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 5, January 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shortening the core. Diphosphapentaarenes, the shorter analogs of diphosphahexaarenes, are stable linearly fused systems containing two six&#8208;membered phosphorus heterocycles. They are fluorescent and their phosphorus atoms can be readily post&#8208;functionalized to modify their optoelectronic properties.







Abstract
Linearly&#8208;fused polyarenes are an important class of compounds with high relevance in materials science. While modifying the shape and size represents a common means to fine&#8208;tune their properties, the precise placement of heteroatoms is a strategy that is receiving an increasing deal of attention to overcome the intrinsic limitations of all&#8208;carbon structures. Thus, linearly&#8208;fused diphosphaarenes recently emerged as a novel family of molecules with striking optoelectronic properties and outstanding stability. However, the properties of diphosphaarenes are far from being benchmarked. Herein, we report the synthesis, phosphorus post&#8208;functionalization and properties of new diphosphapentaarene derivatives. We describe their synthetic limitations and unveil their potential for optoelectronic applications.

The synthesis and late&#8208;stage diversification of BN&#8208;embedded dibenzocorannulenes (B2N2&#8208;DBCs) based on one&#8208;shot halogenative borylation and successive cross&#8208;coupling reaction is reported. An organic light&#8208;emitting diode employing one of the derivatives as an emitter exhibited a high external quantum efficiency of 6.6&#8201;% and long operational lifetime of 907&#8197;h at an initial luminance of 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and late&#8208;stage diversification of a new class of hetero&#8208;buckybowl, BN&#8208;embedded dibenzocorannulenes (B2N2&#8208;DBCs). The synthesis is achieved via one&#8208;shot halogenative borylation, comprising the nitrogen&#8208;directed haloboration of alkyne and an intramolecular bora&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction, which provides BN&#8208;embedded dibenzocorannulene possessing two bromo substituents (B2N2&#8208;DBC&#8208;Br). B2N2&#8208;DBC&#8208;Br undergoes diversification via coupling reactions to provide a variety of arylated derivatives (B2N2&#8208;DBC&#8208;R), exhibiting strong blue fluorescence. An organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) employing one of the derivatives as an emitter exhibited a high external quantum efficiency of 6.6&#8201;% and long operational lifetime of 907&#8197;h at an initial luminance of 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, indicating the significant potential for the development of efficient and stable hetero&#8208;buckybowl&#8208;based OLED materials.

         <title>Maytansinol Functionalization: Towards Useful Probes for Studying Microtubule Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 5, January 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design and synthesis as well as biochemical and structural characterization of long&#8208;chain maytansinoids and maytansinoid conjugates is reported. The results show the prospects of maytansinoids as probes to study microtubule dynamics and lead towards the design of new maytansine&#8208;based derivatives.







Abstract
Maytansinoids are a successful class of natural and semisynthetic tubulin binders, known for their potent cytotoxic activity. Their wider application as cytotoxins and chemical probes to study tubulin dynamics has been held back by the complexity of natural product chemistry. Here we report the synthesis of long&#8208;chain derivatives and maytansinoid conjugates. We confirmed that bulky substituents do not impact their high activity or the scaffold's binding mode. These encouraging results open new avenues for the design of new maytansine&#8208;based probes.

         <title>Efficient Aerobic Oxidative Coupling of Methyl Heteroarenes with Indoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 5, January 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable and environmentally friendly aerobic oxidative coupling of &#945;&#8208;methyl substituted N&#8208;heteroarenes with indoles was first reported. A series of di&#8208;heteroaryl ketones (26 examples) were obtained in moderate yields (up to 72&#8201;% yield), providing a highly atom&#8208;economic approach for synthesizing complex pharmaceutical intermediates from small molecules. A plausible mechanism about cyclic catalysis was proposed and confirmed.







Abstract
Direct oxidative coupling of inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bond has been a great challenge. Herein, an environmentally friendly aerobic oxidative coupling of &#945;&#8208;methyl substituted N&#8208;heteroarenes with indoles is reported. A variety of diheteroaryl ketones were prepared in good yields (up to 72&#8201;%). This protocol features simple operation and broad substrates scope (26 examples). Significantly, a plausible mechanism about catalytic cycle was proposed, and two key intermediates were confirmed by high resolution mass spectrometry.

         <title>Resolving the Chemical Formula of Nesquehonite via NMR Crystallography, DFT Computation, and Complementary Neutron Diffraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 5, January 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
NMR crystallography and neutron diffraction can settle a longstanding debate regarding the chemical formula for the CO2 mineralization target species, nesquehonite, through examination of the effects of H on 13C tensors. It is a hydrated magnesium carbonate [MgCO3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O], and not a hydroxy&#8208; hydrated&#8208; magnesium bicarbonate.







Abstract
Nesquehonite is a magnesium carbonate mineral relevant to carbon sequestration envisioned for carbon capture and storage of CO2. Its chemical formula remains controversial today, assigned as either a hydrated magnesium carbonate [MgCO3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O], or a hydroxy&#8208; hydrated&#8208; magnesium bicarbonate [Mg(HCO3)OH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O]. The resolution of this controversy is central to understanding this material&#8216;s thermodynamic, phase, and chemical behavior. In an NMR crystallography study, using rotational&#8208;echo double&#8208;resonance 13C{1H} (REDOR), 13C&#8722;1H distances are determined with precision, and the combination of 13C static NMR lineshapes and density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to model different H atomic coordinates. [MgCO3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O] is found to be accurate, and evidence from neutron powder diffraction bolsters these assignments. Refined H positions can help understand how H&#8208;bonding stabilizes this structure against dehydration to MgCO3. More broadly, these results illustrate the power of NMR crystallography as a technique for resolving questions where X&#8208;ray diffraction is inconclusive.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Directed Atroposelective C&#8722;H Iodination to Synthesize Axial Chiral Biaryl N&#8208;Oxides via Enantioselective Desymmetrization Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 5, January 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd(II) coordinated by N&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;l&#8208;phenylalanine has been identified as a highly enantioselective catalyst for atroposelective C&#8722;H iodination at room temperature via desymmerization strategy providing nearly enantiopure samples of a diverse range axially chiral biaryl N&#8208;oxides. Mechanistic investigation disclosed the factors that lead to high reactivity and excellent enantiocontrol.







Abstract
The discovery of enantioselective desymmetrization reactions to provide practical synthesis of enantio&#8208;enriched atropisomeric biaryls is a challenging topic in the field of asymmetric catalysis. Herein, we report a highly enantioselective desymmetrization reaction for the synthesis of axially chiral biaryl N&#8208;oxides by atroposelective C&#8722;H iodination by using Pd(II) coordinated by N&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;l&#8208;phenylalanine as a chiral catalyst at room temperature. A broad range of products were obtained in high yields (up to 99&#8201;%) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;% ee). The products could be synthesized in gram scale, one of which was proved to be a powerful organocatalyst in asymmetric allylation reaction. Mechanistic evidence as well as DFT calculations point towards the factors that lead to high reactivity and excellent enantiocontrol in this reaction.

&lt;p&gt;Pd(II) coordinated by &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-benzoyl-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-phenylalanine has been identified as a highly enantioselective catalyst for atroposelective C&#8722;H iodination at room temperature via desymmerization strategy providing nearly enantiopure samples of a diverse range axially chiral biaryl &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-oxides. Mechanistic investigation disclosed the factors that lead to high reactivity and excellent enantiocontrol.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery of enantioselective desymmetrization reactions to provide practical synthesis of enantio-enriched atropisomeric biaryls is a challenging topic in the field of asymmetric catalysis. Herein, we report a highly enantioselective desymmetrization reaction for the synthesis of axially chiral biaryl &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-oxides by atroposelective C&#8722;H iodination by using Pd(II) coordinated by &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-benzoyl-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-phenylalanine as a chiral catalyst at room temperature. A broad range of products were obtained in high yields (up to 99&#8201;%) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;). The products could be synthesized in gram scale, one of which was proved to be a powerful organocatalyst in asymmetric allylation reaction. Mechanistic evidence as well as DFT calculations point towards the factors that lead to high reactivity and excellent enantiocontrol in this reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing Resistance to Chloride Corrosion by Controlling the Morphologies of PtNi Electrocatalysts for Alkaline Seawater Hydrogen Evolution</title>

Corrosion control: A PtNi alloy with a composite morphology comprised of nanobranches and nanoparticles is described. The unique morphology of the PtNi alloy facilitates electron accumulation on Pt, which enhances its resistance to chloride corrosion and performance in electrocatalytic hydrogen production in seawater.







Abstract
A solvothermal method to prepare PtNi alloys that have differing morphologies is described. By adjusting the feed ratio of Pt and Ni precursors in this process, PtNi alloys with different compositions (Pt&#8201;:&#8201;Ni atomic ratio from 1&#8201;:&#8201;3 to 3&#8201;:&#8201;1) and morphologies (evolution from nanobranches to nanoparticles) are generated. The prepared Pt48Ni52 alloy, which has a composite morphology comprised of nanobranches and nanoparticles, exhibits superior activity and durability towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in seawater compared to those of commercial Pt/C catalyst and other PtNi alloys that have different compositions and morphologies. The excellent seawater HER performance of Pt48Ni52 is ascribed to its nanobranch/nanoparticle morphology that optimally facilitates electron accumulation on Pt, which enhances resistance to chloride corrosion in seawater.

A rapid and divergent synthetic route that provides ready&#8208;to&#8208;click pH&#8208;insensitive rhodamine dyes exhibiting outstanding brightness was developed. In EdU cell proliferation assays, our 3,3&#8208;difluoroazetidine rhodamine azide outperformed the popular 5&#8208;TAMRA&#8208;azide. A set of bis&#8208;MPA dendrons carrying multiple fluorescein or our rhodamine revealed self&#8208;quenching effects, suggesting potential application as FRET quenchers.







Abstract
Biorthogonal labelling with fluorescent small molecules is an indispensable tool for diagnostic and biomedical applications. In dye&#8208;based 5&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridine (EdU) cell proliferation assays, augmentation of the fluorescent signal entails an overall enhancement in the sensitivity and quality of the method. To this end, a rapid, divergent synthetic procedure that provides ready&#8208;to&#8208;click pH&#8208;insensitive rhodamine dyes exhibiting outstanding brightness was established. Compared to the shortest available synthesis of related high quantum&#8208;yielding rhodamines, two fewer synthetic steps are required. In a head&#8208;to&#8208;head imaging comparison involving copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide alkyne cycloaddition reactions with in vitro administered EdU, our new 3,3&#8208;difluoroazetidine rhodamine azide outperformed the popular 5&#8208;TAMRA&#8208;azide, making it among the best available choices when it comes to fluorescent imaging of DNA. In a further exploration of the fluorescence properties of these dyes, a set of bis&#8208;MPA dendrons carrying multiple fluorescein or rhodamine units was prepared by branching click chemistry. Fluorescence self&#8208;quenching of fluorescein&#8208; and rhodamine&#8208;functionalized dendrons limited the suitability of the dyes as labels in EdU&#8208;based experiments but provided new insights into these effects.

Integration of Dy(III) hexaazamacrocycle, azido and chirality produces the first chiral all&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;coordinated Dy&#8208;SMMs.







Abstract
Two pairs of chiral end&#8208;on azido&#8208;bridged dinuclear hexaazamacrocycles, [Dy2(LN6R/S)2(N3)2Cl2](BPh4)2 (1R/1S) and [Dy2(LN6R/S)2(N3)4]Cl2 (2R/2S) (LN6R/S is hexaazamacrocyclic neutral Schiff base ligand derived from 2,6&#8208;diformylpyridine and (1R, 2R)/(1S, 2S)&#8208;diaminocyclohexane), were constructed by adjusting the molar ratio of sodium azide to Dy(III) macrocycle precursor. Structural analyses reveal that all Dy(III) centers in complexes 1R/1S and 2R/2S are nine&#8208;coordinate with hula&#8208;loop coordination geometry, and the differences between 1R/1S and 2R/2S are the terminal coordination anion and counter anion. Magnetic studies indicate that complex 2S displays typical SMM behaviors under a zero dc field, whereas 1S just shows slow relaxation of magnetization resulting from a relatively weak axial crystal field. Significantly, complex 2R/2S represents the first homochiral all&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;coordinated lanthanide single&#8208;molecule magnet.

         <title>Selective Metal&#8208;ion Complexation of a Biomimetic Calix[6]arene Funnel Cavity Functionalized with Phenol or Quinone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 5, January 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The calixarene core allows the introduction of functional groups at remote distance from the metal ion, but in the vicinity of its labile site. Introducing a phenol or quinone moiety in the calix core, in place of anisole, drastically changes not only thermodynamics but also kinetics of metal ion and guest&#8208;ligand binding, while the first coordination sphere is not affected.







Abstract
In the biomimetic context, many studies have evidenced the importance of the 1st and 2nd coordination sphere of a metal ion for controlling its properties. Here, we propose to evaluate a yet poorly explored aspect, which is the nature of the cavity that surrounds the metal labile site. Three calix[6]arene&#8208;based aza&#8208;ligands are compared, that differ only by the nature of cavity walls, anisole, phenol or quinone (LOMe, LOH and LQ). Monitoring ligand exchange of their ZnII complexes evidenced important differences in the metal ion relative affinities for nitriles, halides or carboxylates. It also showed a possible sharp kinetic control on both, metal ion binding and ligand exchange. Hence, this study supports the observations reported on biological systems, highlighting that the substitution of an amino&#8208;acid residue of the enzyme active site, at remote distance of the metal ion, can have strong impacts on metal ion lability, substrate/product exchange or selectivity.

&lt;/b&gt;). Monitoring ligand exchange of their Zn&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complexes evidenced important differences in the metal ion relative affinities for nitriles, halides or carboxylates. It also showed a possible sharp kinetic control on both, metal ion binding and ligand exchange. Hence, this study supports the observations reported on biological systems, highlighting that the substitution of an amino-acid residue of the enzyme active site, at remote distance of the metal ion, can have strong impacts on metal ion lability, substrate/product exchange or selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unveiling the Metal Incorporation Effect of Steady&#8208;Active FeP Hydrogen Evolution Nanocatalysts for Water Electrolyzer</title>

This work reports the homogeneous incorporation of Co into the FeP host to promote both activity and stability of HER for the PEMWE application and demonstrates the probable origin of the high performance by ex situ experiments.







Abstract
Metal phosphides are promising noble metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but they usually suffer from inferior stability and thus are far from the device applications. We reported a facile and controllable synthetic method to prepare metal&#8208;incorporated M&#8208;FeP nanoparticles (M=Cr, Mn, Co, Fe, Ni, Cu, and Mo) with the guide of the density functional theory (DFT). The evaluated HER activity sequence was consistent with the DFT predictions, and cobalt was revealed to be the appropriate dopant. With the optimization of the Co/Fe ratio, the Fe0.67Co0.33P/C only required overpotentials of 67&#8197;mV and 129&#8197;mV to obtain the cathodic current density of 10 and 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. It maintained the initial activity in the 10&#8197;h stability test, surpassing the other Co&#8208;FeP/C catalysts. Ex situ experiments demonstrated that the decreased element leaching and the increased surface phosphide content contributed to the high stability of the Fe0.67Co0.33P/C. A proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer was assembled using the Fe0.67Co0.33P/C as the cathodic catalyst. It showed a current density of 0.8&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at the applied voltage of 2.0&#8197;V and retained the initial activity in the 1000 cycles&#8217; stability test, suggesting the potential application of the catalysts.

         <title>Synthesis of 1&#8208;Aminoisoquinolines and Their Application in a Host&#8208;Guest Doped Strategy To Construct Ultralong Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Materials for Bioimaging</title>

A convenient, efficient and direct approach toward structurally diverse substituted 1&#8208;aminoisoquinoline derivatives has been developed. By simply doping the 1&#8208;aminoisoquinolines into benzophenone (BP), a series of RTP systems with tunable lifetime luminescence can be realized. 4&#8201;r/BP nanoparticles could be used for in&#8208;vivo imaging with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio.







Abstract
Organic ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have attracted great attention for their wide applications in optoelectronic devices and bioimaging. However, the development of these materials remains a challenging task, partially due to the lack of rational molecular design strategies and unclear luminescence mechanisms. Herein, we present a method for facile access to structurally diverse substituted 1&#8208;aminoisoquinoline derivatives through a copper&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component coupling reaction that provides a promising approach to rapidly assemble a library of 1&#8208;aminoisoquinolines for exploring the regularity of the host&#8208;guest doped system. A series of host&#8208;guest RTP materials with wide&#8208;ranging lifetimes from 4.4 to 299.3&#8197;ms were constructed by doping various substituted isoquinolines derivatives into benzophenone (BP). Furthermore, 4&#8201;r/BP nanoparticles could be used for in&#8208;vivo imaging with a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio value as high as 32, revealing the potential of the isoquinoline framework for the construction of high&#8208;performance RTP materials.

         <title>Boosting Ring Strain and Lewis Acidity of Borirane: Synthesis, Reactivity and Density Functional Theory Studies of an Uncoordinated Arylborirane Fused to o&#8208;Carborane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 5, January 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An uncoordinated o&#8208;carborane&#8208;fused arylborirane was synthesized, which not only allows the 1,2&#8208;insertion of C=O or C&#8801;N to proceed under milder conditions, but also enables the heretofore unknown dearomative 1,4&#8208;insertion of Ar&#8722;(C=O)&#8722; into a B&#8722;C bond. The detailed computational mechanism studies show the relevance of both ring strain and Lewis acidity to the unique reaction profiles.







Abstract
Among the parent borirane, benzoborirene and ortho&#8208;dicarbadodecaborane&#8208;fused borirane, the latter possesses the highest ring strain and the highest Lewis acidity according to our density functional theory (DFT) studies. The synthesis of this class of compounds is thus considerably challenging. The existing examples require either a strong &#960;&#8208;donating group or an extra ligand for B&#8208;coordination, which nevertheless suppresses or completely turns off the Lewis acidity. The title compound, which possesses both features, not only allows the 1,2&#8208;insertion of P=O, C=O or C&#8801;N to proceed under milder conditions, but also enables the heretofore unknown dearomative 1,4&#8208;insertion of Ar&#8722;(C=O)&#8722; into a B&#8722;C bond. The fusion of strained molecular systems to an o&#8208;carborane cage shows great promise for boosting both the ring strain and acidity.

         <title>Bright Organic Mechanoluminescence and Remarkable Mechanofluorochromism from Circularly Polarized TADF Enantiomers with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Properties
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 5, January 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of organic enantiomers with aggregation&#8208;induced emission and circularly polarized thermally activated delayed fluorescence properties have been developed successfully. Furthermore, it is found that their crystals can emit strong blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence and produce bright sky&#8208;blue mechanoluminescence and remarkable mechanofluorochromism under the stimuli of force.







Abstract
The development of circularly polarized thermally activated delayed fluorescence (CP&#8208;TADF) luminogens with stimuli&#8208;response characteristics remains challenging. Herein, a pair of organic enantiomers, S&#8208;CzTA and R&#8208;CzTA, with aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties, have been successfully developed by introducing chiral 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydronaphthalene and carbazole to phthalimide. They present CP&#8208;TADF properties in toluene solutions, giving dissymmetric factors of 0.84&#215;10&#8722;3 and &#8722;1.03&#215;10&#8722;3, respectively. In the crystalline state, both S&#8208;CzTA and R&#8208;CzTA can emit intense blue TADF and produce very bright sky&#8208;blue mechanoluminescence (ML) and remarkable mechanofluorochromism (MFC) under the stimuli of mechanical force. Single&#8208;crystal analysis and theoretical calculation results suggest that their ML activities are probably associated with their chiral and polar molecular structures and unique non&#8208;centrosymmetric molecular packing modes. Furthermore, the MFC properties of the enantiomers likely originate from the destruction of crystal structure, leading to the planarization of molecular conformation. This work may provide helpful guidance for developing new CP&#8208;TADF materials with force&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive properties.

         <title>Dioxygen Splitting by a Tantalum(V) Complex Ligated by a Rigid, Redox Non&#8208;Innocent Pincer Ligand
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 5, January 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a tantalum(V) dichloride complex ligated by a rigid and redox non&#8208;innocent pincer ligand is reported. Cyclic voltammetry and derivatization reactions show that up to two electrons can be transferred from the ligand to the metal. Exposing this complex to O2 leads to the formation of an oxygen bridged dinuclear complex resulting from the full reduction of O2 to O2&#8722;.







Abstract
The reaction of TaMe3Cl2 with the rigid acridane&#8208;derived trisamine H3NNN yields the tantalum(V) complex [TaCl2(NNNcat)]. Subsequent reaction with dioxygen results in the full four&#8208;electron reduction of O2 yielding the oxido&#8208;bridged bimetallic complex [{TaCl2(NNNsq)}2O]. This dinuclear complex features an open&#8208;shell ground state due to partial ligand oxidation and was comprehensively characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, LIFDI mass spectrometry, NMR, EPR, IR and UV/VIS/NIR spectroscopy. The mechanism of O2 activation was investigated by DFT calculations revealing initial binding of O2 to the tantalum(V) center followed by complete O2 scission to produce a terminal oxido&#8208;complex.

         <dc:description>
The molecular modification strategies for maintaining both high efficiency and narrow&#8208;band profiles are highlighted by a review of the progress in iterations of carbonyl&#8208;containing thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules from conventional TADF emitters with twisted donor&#8208;acceptor structures to multi&#8208;resonance TADF molecules with fused skeletons. For more details, see the Review by L.&#8208;S. Liao, Z.&#8208;Q. Jiang, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202628).

         <dc:description>
The interfacial chemistry at the aqueous&#8208;non&#8208;aqueous interface can be use to trigger chemical transformation of perovskite nanocrystals. In this review, evolution of several dimensional halide (X) perovskites from non&#8208;perovskite zero dimensional Cs4PbX6 phase has been revealed through water&#8208;assisted approach, which further may use to transform other non&#8208;perovskite phase (e.g., CsPb2X5), as well as doping in halide perovskites.

Work with the elements of nature: Our building block, maytansinol, represented as a constellation of stars, is the main protagonist of the story. A ray of light coming out from it demonstrates how different moieties can be attached to it, opening new horizons. As maytansinoids show a destabilising effect on microtubules, we represent the latter by trees. The tree trunk is a microtubule, from which the tubulins are disassembling into the leaves. The TubInTrain logo in the corner represents the H2020&#8208;MSCA&#8208;ITN&#8208;2019 network that made this interdisciplinary investigation possible.

         <title>Cover Feature: Resolving the Chemical Formula of Nesquehonite via NMR Crystallography, DFT Computation, and Complementary Neutron Diffraction (Chem. Eur. J. 5/2023)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 5, January 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mg&#8208;containing species can &#8220;chemically trap&#8221; CO2, and nesquehonite is one such metastable mineral. Its chemical formula has been debated for decades as Mg(HCO3)(OH)&#8901;2&#8201;H2O or MgCO3&#8901;3&#8201;H2O. The thermodynamics of the route to stable carbonates require knowledge of the captured CO2 as either a carbonate or bicarbonate. To determine the precise atomic coordinates of hydrogens present, we combined solid&#8208;state 13C NMR lineshapes and REDOR with density functional theory and confirmation by neutron diffraction. The perturbation of 13C NMR lineshapes by nearby hydrogens is a persuasive indicator. More information can be found in the Research Article by S.&#8197;E. Hayes and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203052).

The progress of ketone&#8208;based TADF emitters with narrow&#8208;band properties is summarized. The molecular design involved in maintaining excellent device efficiency and extraordinary color purity is highlighted.







Abstract
Carbonyl&#8208;containing derivatives show enduring vitality in the field of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials; they can realize high device efficiency by using both singlet and triplet excitons for electroluminescence. Recently, a system based on fused ketone/amine exhibited huge potential for constructing multi&#8208;resonance TADF (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters, which exhibit higher narrow&#8208;band emission than conventional TADF emitters with twisted donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) structure. Herein, we summarize current research progress in both traditional and MR&#8208;type ketone derivatives with TADF characteristics for introducing the molecular design strategy of maintaining high device efficiency while keeping narrow&#8208;band emission profile. We hope this review can inspire the emergence of more high&#8208;performance narrow&#8208;band materials.

         <title>Water&#8208;Triggered Chemical Transformation of Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 5, January 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;triggered interfacial chemistry shows promising advantage for morphology, shape and composition control towards formation of new bio&#8208;compatible perovskite nanocrystals. In this Review, the recent development of this unique approach at the water&#8211;hexane interface that may be extended to tailor not only CsPbX3 but also perovskite nanocrystals beyond this family is summarized.







Abstract
Recently emerged lead&#8208;halide perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) are promising optoelectronic material due to their easy solution processability, wide range of color tunability, as well as very high photoluminescence quantum yield. Despite their significant success in lab&#8208;scale optoelectronic applications, the long&#8208;term stability becomes the main issue, hindering them towards commercialization. The highly ionic nature of such lead&#8208;halide structure makes them extremely unstable in water and air. But a very few groups have taken the advantage of such nature of the crystal structure for water&#8208;triggered chemical transformation towards shape, composition, and morphology controlled stable and bright PNCs, which are otherwise difficult to obtain by typical direct approach. Furthermore, using polymer as an encapsulating layer for the PNCs, water&#8208;soluble stable PNCs have been prepared. In this review, the recent progress on the water&#8211;hexane interface chemistry towards chemical transformation to produce several PNCs is described. Such method not only ensure to yield several shape&#8208;controlled perovskites nanocrystals, but also formation of perovskites in aqueous phase that show promising application towards bio&#8208;imaging.

         <title>Ultrafast Electron Transfer Dynamics of Organic Polymer Nanoparticles with Graphene Oxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We prepared organic polymer poly&#8208;3&#8208;hexylthiophene (p3ht) nanoparticles (NPs) and graphene oxide (GO)/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) composites p3ht NPs&#8208;GO/RGO by using the reprecipitation method. We demonstrated that GO/RGO could improve the ordering and planarity of p3ht chains as well as the formation of p3ht NPs, and confirmed the effects of GO/RGO on the fluorescence and carrier transport dynamics of p3ht NPs by using femtosecond fluorescence upconversion and transient absorption (TA) techniques. Ultrafast electron transfer (~1ps) between GO/RGO and p3ht NPs quenched the fluorescence of p3ht NPs, indicating excellent properties of p3ht NPs&#8208;GO/RGO as the charge transfer complexes. Efficient electron transfer may promote the applications of p3ht NPs&#8208;GO/RGO composites in organic polymer solar cells and photocatalysis. Moreover, RGO had stronger interfacial interactions and more matched conduction band energy levels with p3ht NPs than GO did, which implied that p3ht NPs&#8208;RGO might have greater application values than p3ht NPs&#8208;GO.</dc:description>

         <title>Melt Castable Derivatives of Pentaerythritol Tetranitrate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the search for high&#8208;performance and environmentally friendly energetic materials, derivatization of known materials is an often&#8208;applied concept to fulfill modern day demands. It is surprising that the long know pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) has only been derivatized to a limited extent. PETN shows a brought application in energetic materials or in pharmaceutics. In this work the PETN backbone is modified by introducing nitramine, ionic nitramine, amine, ionic amine and tetrazole functionalities. The obtained and structural similar compounds allow good comparability and insights into functional group effects on sensitivity, thermal behavior and performance. The functionalization is resulting in melting points in the range of 64 to 126 &#176;C. Some compounds are therefore potential candidates to replace toxic TNT.</dc:description>

         <title>Photophysical Characterization of Isoguanine in a Prebiotic&#8208;Like Environment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is intriguing how a mixture of organic molecules survived the prebiotic UV fluxes and evolved into the actual genetic building blocks. Scientists are trying to shed light on this issue by synthesizing nucleic acid monomers and their analogues under prebiotic Era&#8208;like conditions and by exploring their excited state dynamics. To further add to this important body of knowledge, here we disclose new insights into the photophysical properties of protonated isoguanine, an isomorph of guanine, using steady&#8208;state and femtosecond broadband transient absorption spectroscopies, and quantum mechanical calculations. Protonated isoguanine decays in ultrafast time scales following 292 nm excitation, consistently with the barrierless paths connecting the bright S1 (&#960;&#960;*) state with different internal conversion funnels. Complementary calculations for neutral isoguanine predict similar photophysical properties. Our results demonstrate that protonated isoguanine can be considered photostable in contrast to protonated guanine, which exhibits 40&#8208;fold longer excited state lifetimes.</dc:description>

         <title>Induced CPL&#8208;active Materials based on Chiral Supramolecular Co&#8208;assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) has attracted much interest due to its potential applications on chiral photonic techniques and optoelectronic materials science. As known, dissymmetry factor (gem) of CPL is one essential factor for evaluating the features of CPL&#8208;active materials. Much attention has focused on how to increase the gem value, which is one of the most important issues for CPL practical applications. Recently, more and more works have demonstrated that chiral supramolecular could provide the significant strategy to improve the gem value through the orderly helical superstructure of chiral building blocks. Normally, this kind of chiral supramolecular assembly process can be accompanied by chirality transfer and induction mechanism, which can promote the amplification effect on the induced CPL of achiral dyes. In this review, we fully summarized recent advances on the induced CPL&#8208;active materials of chiral supramolecular co&#8208;assemblies, their applications in circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) and current challenges.</dc:description>

         <title>Structures and Supramolecular Properties of Inclusion Complexes of Anthracene&#8208;Triptycene Nanocages with Fullerene Guests and Their Dynamic Motion as Molecular Gyroscopes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three types of anthracene&#8208;triptycene nanocages having various peripheral substituents formed inclusion complexes with fullerene guests via multipoint CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis provided the first direct structural evidence of the inclusion complex formation and the unique dynamic behavior of the included C60 molecule in the cage cavity, and showed that the complex behaved as a supramolecular gyroscope.







Abstract
Three derivatives of macrocyclic cage compounds consisting of diarylanthracene and triptycene units were synthesized. These nanocages formed host&#8208;guest complexes with C60 and other fullerene guests as confirmed by 1H NMR and fluorescence spectroscopy. The association constant of the mesityl and 2,4,6&#8208;tributoxyphenyl derivatives with C60 was determined to be 2.2 &#215; 104&#8197;L&#8201;mol&#8722;1, which was larger than that of the pentafluorophenyl derivative. Direct experimental evidence of the complexation was obtained by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis: the guest C60 molecule was included in the cavity via multipoint CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions. Dynamic disorders of the included C60 molecule in variable&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray analysis indicated uniaxial motion, such as gyroscopic motion. The unique dynamic behavior of the spherical C60 rotor anchored by the cage stator via CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions in the crystal, as well as substituent effects on the association properties, are discussed with the aid of DFT calculations.

         <title>Development of Low&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Organogelators from Cyclic &#946;&#8208;Amino Acid: Effect of Stereochemistry and their Application on Visual Chiral Recognition of Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low molecular weight organogelators derived from chiral cyclic &#946;&#8208;amino acids were developed and the effect of their stereochemistry on gelation behavior was investigated. After characterization of the gelators and resultant xerogels, the prepared chiral gel was further applied to the visual chiral recognition of two enantiomers of amines.







Abstract
This study reports the formation of low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelators based on carboxylic acids derived from chiral cyclic&#946;&#8208;amino acids. The effect of their stereochemistry on the gelation of organic solvents was investigated, and their assemblies with the intermolecular interactions in the xerogels were proposed via infrared spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and crystallographic details of the related model compounds. The effect of the alkyl chain length on the gelators was studied, and they were applied to the chiral recognition of amines. Only one diastereomeric salt with amines afforded gels, whereas the others resulted in precipitates. Chiral recognition was also achieved in the gel state, and the appearance of the as&#8208;prepared gel changed upon the addition of each amine enantiomer, thus enabling the visual detection of their chirality.

         <title>MOF&#8208;derived NiCo&#8208;LDH Nanocages on CuO Nanorod Arrays for Robust and High Energy Density Asymmetric Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchical CuO@NiCo&#8208;LDH heterostructure has been constructed through a facile MOF&#8208;engaged strategy, and it exhibits significantly boosted electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Layered double hydroxide (LDH) is widely explored in supercapacitors on account of its high capacity, adjustable composition and easy synthesis process. Unfortunately, solitary LDH still has great limitations as an electrode material due to its shortcomings, such as poor conductivity and easy agglomeration. Herein, nanoflakes assembled NiCo&#8208;LDH hollow nanocages derived from a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) precursor are strung by CuO nanorods formed from etching and oxidation of copper foam (CF), forming hierarchical CuO@NiCo&#8208;LDH heterostructures. The as&#8208;synthesized CuO@NiCo&#8208;LDH/CF shows a large capacitance (5607&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), superior rate performance (88.3&#8201;% retention at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and impressive cycling durability (93.1&#8201;% capacitance is retained after 5000 cycles), which is significantly superior to control CuO/CF, CuO@ZIF&#8208;67/CF, NiCo&#8208;LDH/CF and Cu(OH)2@NiCo&#8208;LDH/CF electrodes. Besides, an asymmetrical supercapacitor consists of CuO@NiCo&#8208;LDH/CF and activated carbon displays a maximum energy density of 47.3&#8197;Wh kg&#8722;1, and its capacitance only declines by 6.8&#8201;% after 10000 cycles, demonstrating remarkable cycling durability. The advantages of highly conductive and robust CuO nanorods, MOF&#8208;derived hollow structure and the core&#8208;shell heterostructure contribute to the outstanding electrochemical performance. This synthesis strategy can be extended to design various core&#8208;shell heterostructures adopted in versatile electrochemical energy storage applications.

         <title>Long&#8208;Acting Insulin&#8208;Zwitterionic Polymer Conjugate Mitigates Hypoglycemia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although the discovery of insulin has radically improved the treatment and prognosis of diabetes, bringing it from an incurable disease to a manageable chronic disease, it faces problems of the short half&#8208;life and poor stability during its clinical use. Zwitterionic polymer shows unique properties of antifouling and low immunogenicity. By conjugation with zwitterionic polymer, stabilily and pharmacokinetics of insulin are both improved greatly. Most importantly, this insulin&#8208;zwitterionic polymer conjugate significantly decreases the incidence of hypoglycemia.







Abstract
Insulin, a main medication to control glycemia of type&#8197;1 and advanced type&#8197;2 diabetes, faces problems of a short half&#8208;life and poor stability during its clinical use. Zwitterionic polymer shows unique properties of antifouling and low immunogenicity. Here, we have synthesized a new insulin&#8208;zwitterionic polymer conjugate (INS&#8208;PMPC) through grafting&#8208;from strategy by controlled radical polymerization. Apart from showing excellent stability upon mechanical agitation, the resulting INS&#8208;PMPC conjugate provided over 20&#8197;h of glycemic control due to improved pharmacokinetics in diabetic mice with one single subcutaneous injection. Most importantly, this insulin&#8208;zwitterionic polymer conjugate significantly decreases the incidence of hypoglycemia.

         <dc:description>
A copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed interrupted domino reaction of 2&#8208;azido sulfoximines with 1&#8208;iodoalkynes affords fused triazolyl&#8208;containing benzothiadiazine&#8208;1&#8208;oxides in good to excellent yields. The substrate scope is broad and the functional group tolerance high. Mechanistic studies suggest a reaction pathway via copper &#960;&#8208;complexes and a consecutive oxidative coupling of a relevant iodinated triazole as intermediate.







Abstract
Copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed domino reactions of 2&#8208;azido sulfoximines with 1&#8208;iodoalkynes yield fused triazolyl&#8208;containing benzothiadiazine&#8208;1&#8208;oxides. The protocol features the synthesis of two fused heterocyclic rings in one step with good to excellent yields and a broad functional group tolerance. Detailed mechanistic investigations indicate that a copper &#960;&#8208;complex initiates a cycloaddition and oxidative C&#8722;N coupling reaction sequence. The results suggest an interrupted domino process involving an iodinated triazole as a key intermediate.

         <title>Full&#8208;Color Emissive D&#8208;D&#8208;A Carbazole Luminophores: Red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR Mechano&#8208;fluorochromism, Aggregation&#8208;Induced Near&#8208;Infrared Emission, and Application in Photodynamic Therapy</title>

A riot of color: We have developed eight D&#8208;D&#8208;A type carbazole derivatives capable of exhibiting full&#8208;color solid&#8208;state emission. Notably, this is the first time that a dicyano&#8208;functionalized triphenylamine&#8208;modified carbazole derivative has not only displayed noteworthy aggregation&#8208;induced near&#8208;infrared emission, but also achieved the rare red&#8208;to&#8208;near&#8208;infrared mechano&#8208;fluorochromism with high contrast beyond 100&#8197;nm. Furthermore, the red&#8208;emissive luminophore has potential applications in cell imaging and photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
The preparation of multifunctionalized luminophores with full&#8208;color emission based on an identical core skeleton is a significative but challenging research topic. In this work, eight donor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;D&#8208;A)&#8208;type luminogens based on a central carbazole core bearing a C6 hydrocarbon chain were designed by using different kinds of donor and acceptor units on the left and right, and synthesized in good yields. These D&#8208;D&#8208;A carbazole derivatives display deep&#8208;blue, sky&#8208;blue, cyan, green, yellow&#8208;green, yellow, orange and red fluorescence in the solid state, achieving full&#8208;color emission covering the whole visible light range under UV light illumination. Notably, the dicyano&#8208;functionalized triphenylamine&#8208;containing carbazole derivative exhibits rare aggregation&#8208;induced near&#8208;infrared emission and red&#8208;to&#8208;near&#8208;infrared mechano&#8208;fluorochromism with high contrast beyond 100&#8197;nm. Furthermore, the red&#8208;emissive luminogen can serve as a potential candidate for cell imaging and photodynamic therapy (PDT). This work not only provides reference for the construction of full&#8208;color emissive systems but also opens a new avenue to the preparation of multifunctionalized luminophores capable of simultaneous application in near&#8208;Infrared mechanical&#8208;force sensors and PDT fields.

         <title>N,N&#8208;Diphenyl Dihydrophenazines: Using &#960;&#8208;Extension to Access Dicationic Multifunctional Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of &#960;&#8208;extended dihydrophenazines represents a new promising pathway for the stabilization of the radical and dicationic states of these molecules. This could in turn open for brand new applications of this class of molecules in many different fields, from molecular actuators to electrochromic devices.







Abstract
Dihydrophenazines are receiving increasing attention due to applications in numerous fields of chemistry, from light emission to organo&#8208;photocatalysis. Despite this growing interest and numerous works involving the preparation of radical cations based on this scaffold, the isolation and study of the aromatic dications obtained by 2 electron oxidation of dihydrophenazines is still mostly unexplored. From this point of view, along with the substitution at the N atoms generally used to tune dihydrophenazine properties, the &#960;&#8208;extension of the phenazine core could play a crucial role in making dicationic states accessible. This could result in an extension of the knowledge on these elusive dications and in potentially highly interesting applications ranging from material science to molecular actuators.

         <title>Zinc Substituted Myoglobin&#8210;Albumin Fusion Protein: A&#160;Photosensitizer for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Myoglobin combined with human serum albumin (Mb&#8208;HSA) can be produced using yeast Pichia pastoris as a host strain, with secretion into the culture medium. This Mb&#8208;HSA fusion protein possesses identical O2 binding affinity to that of naked Mb. The Mb unit is reconstituted with a zinc(II) protoporphyrin IX, yielding (zinc substituted Mb)&#8208;HSA, ZnMb&#8208;HSA. The photophysical property and singlet O2 generation ability of ZnMb&#8208;HSA are equivalent to those of ZnMb.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Myoglobin combined with human serum albumin (Mb-HSA) can be produced using yeast Pichia pastoris as a host strain, with secretion into the culture medium. This Mb-HSA fusion protein possesses identical O2 binding affinity to that of naked Mb. The Mb unit is reconstituted with a zinc(II) protoporphyrin IX, yielding (zinc substituted Mb)-HSA, ZnMb-HSA. The photophysical property and singlet O2 generation ability of ZnMb-HSA are equivalent to those of ZnMb. In vitro cell experiments revealed that ZnMb-HSA acts as a superior photosensitizer for photodynamic cancer therapy. It is noteworthy that ZnMb-HSA shows long circulation lifetime in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Adding rigid aromatic dinitriles ortho/meta/para&#8208;(NC)2C6H4 in a one&#8208;pot reaction between [CpRFe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] and AgSbF6 leads to various coordination polymers (CPs) by a three&#8208;component self&#8208;assembly. The sterical demand of the differently substituted cyclopentadiene ligands as well as the rigid constitution of the isomeric dinitriles (NC)2C6H4 play a key role in the formation of the isolated CPs.

         <title>Expanding the horizon of bio&#8208;inspired catalyst design with tactical incorporation of drug molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of potent H2 production catalysts is a key aspect in our journey toward the establishment of a sustainable carbon&#8208;neutral power infrastructure. Hydrogenase enzymes provide the blueprint for designing efficient catalysts by the rational combination of central metal core and protein scaffold&#8208;based outer coordination sphere (OCS). Traditionally, a biomimetic catalyst is crafted by including natural amino acids as OCS features around a synthetic metal motif to functionally imitate the metalloenzyme activity. Here, we have pursued an unconventional approach and implanted two distinct drug molecules (isoniazid and nicotine hydrazide) at the axial position of a cobalt core to create a new genre of synthetic catalysts. The resultant cobalt complexes are active for both electrocatalytic and photocatalytic H2 production in near&#8208;neutral water, where they significantly enhance the catalytic performance of the unfunctionalized parent cobalt complex. The drug molecules showcased a dual effect as they influence the catalytic HER by improving the surrounding proton relay along and exerting subtle electronic effects. The isoniazid&#8208;ligated catalyst C1 outperformed the nicotine hydrazide&#8208;bound complex C2, as it produced H2 from water (pH 6.0) at a rate of 3960 s&#8208;1 while exhibiting Faradaic efficiency of about 90%. This strategy opens up newer avenues of bio&#8208;inspired catalyst design beyond amino acid&#8208;based OCS features.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>For decades there were many attempts to dispense with stoichiometric amounts of metal reagents for the synthesis of secondary alcohols. In 2021, the synthetic results of Newman and collaborators pioneered a synthesis still with metals, but not as reactants, but as catalytic engines. Here is a description by means of Density Functional Theory calculations of how this process can occur, and an attempt is made to shed light on the mechanism that facilitates the attainment of secondary alcohols, emphasizing the eternal cross&#8208;coupling debate of whether the catalytically active species is Ni(0) or they are really taking shortcuts following the course of Ni(II). Effective Orbital analyses give a clear picture. In addition, this paper gives insight into not only the nature of the ligands of the metal catalyst, but also the role of the base.</dc:description>

         <title>The Mechanochemical Fries Rearrangement: Manipulating Isomer Ratios in the Synthesis of p&#8208;Hydroxyacetophenone at Different Scales</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we present the first mechanochemical Fries rearrangement for the industrially important synthesis of para hydroxyacetophenone, inside a ball mill and a twin&#8208;screw extruder. Our approach leads to a yield of 62&#160;% in as little as 90 minutes while liquid&#8208;assisted grinding can shift the isomer ratio resulting in an excess of the desired para product. The multigram scale&#8208;up via extrusion leads to 61&#160;% yield in only three minutes while completely avoiding solvents. The extrusion temperature can even further be reduced by combining extrusion with a subsequent ageing step.</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling long&#8208;lived polymeric room temperature phosphorescence material in&#160;abominable&#160;solvent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Long&#8208;lived RTP&#160;materials have drawn more attention due to their convenient preparation process and equally efficient phosphorescence performance in recent years. As the polymer matrix is sensitive to air and humidity, some non&#8208;covalent interactions in the matrix are easily decomposed in water or air, which means that it is difficult for this material to be stored stably for a long time in the atmospheric environment or under harsh conditions. In this work, polymer powder mBPipQ contains aromatic and piperidine rings that are designed and synthesized successfully. Then the polymer is uniformly dispersed into epoxy resin matrix to form long&#8208;lived polymeric RTP material with efficient afterglow&#160;properties. The stiff backbone structure of mBPip and dense molecular arrangement of epoxy resin provide a rigid environment to stabilize triplet excitons, the RTP performance is greatly enhanced. The lifetime of mBPipQ in epoxy resin is 2 times higher than that of small molecule chromophore in that one. Interestingly, after soaking in strong acid or alkali solution for 10 days, the material can still emit stable and efficient long&#8208;lived phosphorescence. It is thanks to the hard matrix after full curing, which can provide a protective layer to prevent external quenchers from interfering with phosphorescence emission.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoactive organo&#8208;sulfur polymers for hydrogen generation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis of photoactive polymeric organo&#8208;sulfur (POS) materials. These polymers absorb light in the ultraviolet/visible and near&#8208;infrared region of the solar spectrum, and upon irradiation, they reduce water to hydrogen (H2). The decoration of POS materials with nitrile (&#8208;CN) groups is found to be the critical factor for enhanced interactions with the co&#8208;catalyst, Ni2P, leading to greater H2 evolution rates compared to the nitrile&#8208;free POS material.</dc:description>

         <title>The Biologically Inspired Abilities of Metallosupramolecular Architectures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural machinery such as proteins and enzymes can bind substrates and perform intricate functions on these molecules. This behavior is mediated by highly ordered but conformationally flexible structures dictated through favorable intra&#8208; and intermolecular interactions. Metallosupramolecular architectures (MSAs) function as synthetic machinery that are responsive to their environment, and display similar, but less impressive, abilities to their biological counterparts. Natural and synthetic systems share the properties of molecular recognition and catalysis facilitated through the often complex structures of these architectures. This review &#160;article outlines the efforts to use metallosupramolecular structures to mimic the properties of biological enzymes and machines using important recent examples from the field.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperative Friedel&#8208;Crafts Alkylation of Electron&#8208;Deficient Arenes via Catalyst Activation with Hexafluoroisopropanol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation of electron&#8208;deficient arenes with aldehydes through ''catalyst activation'' is presented. Through hydrogen bonding interactions, the solvent 1,1,1,3,3,3, &#8208;hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) interacted with the added Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst pTSA.H2O, increasing its acidity. This activated catalyst enabled the Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation of electron&#8208;neutral as well as electron&#8211;deficient arenes. Strongly electron withdrawing arenes including arenes with multiple halogen atoms, NO2, CHO, CO2R, and CN, groups acted as efficient nucleophiles in this reaction. DFT studies reveal multiple roles of solvent HFIP viz; increasing the Br&#248;nsted acidity of the catalyst pTSA&#8226;H2O, and stabilization of the transition states through a concerted pathway enabling the challenging reaction.</dc:description>

A highly efficient catalytic asymmetric Rubottom&#8208;type oxidation is described. Using meta&#8208;chloroperbenzoic acid (m&#8208;CPBA) as the oxidant and chiral calcium phosphate as the catalyst, the facile transformation enables direct hydroxylation of N&#8208;Boc oxindoles and &#946;&#8208;ketoesters in high yields (up to 99&#8201;%) and in a highly enantioenriched fashion (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee).

         <title>Photocatalytic Synthesis of Acetals and Ketals from Aldehydes and Silylenolethers without the Use of Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Use light instead of acids: Silylenolethers derived from aldehydes and ketones as well as aldehydes themselves react efficiently to give acetals in good to excellent yields. The substrate range with respect to both aldehydes and alcohols is broad, and acid&#8208; and hydrogen&#8208;labile protecting groups are tolerated.







Abstract
Acetals and ketals are among the most important protecting groups for carbonyl compounds. A new method for acetalization and ketalization by means of photoredox catalysis has been developed. A biscyanolated perylene bisimide is used as an electron&#8208;poor photocatalyst, together with green light (525&#8197;nm LED). Silylenolethers derived from aldehydes react efficiently to give acetals in good to excellent yields. A broad substrate range was shown with respect to both the aldehydes and the alcohols. The functional group tolerance is high; in particular, acid&#8208; and hydrogen&#8208;labile protecting groups are tolerated. Aldehydes can also be directly and selectively converted into the respective acetals. Only ketones must be converted to their silylenolethers before ketalization. This photocatalytic method works without any use of acids or photoacids, and does not need any additives or H&#8208;atom transfer reagents. Hence, it broadens the substrate scope and repertoire of photoredox catalysis with respect to carbonyl chemistry.

         <title>Visible Light Thiyl Radical&#8208;Mediated Desilylation of Arylsilanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Commercially available and cheap disulfides proved to be excellent thiyl&#8208;radical sources for the mild desilylation of arylsilanes under visible&#8208;light irradiation. This method relying in a radical chain mechanism shows a broad applicability and functional group tolerance, allowing for the effective reaction of simple arylsilanes, as well as complex structures and therapeutic derivatives.







Abstract
A straightforward, visible&#8208;light triggered desilylation of arylsilanes by thiyl radicals is presented. Silyl groups are often used to block a reactive position in multi&#8208;step organic synthesis, for which a mild cleavage at a late&#8208;stage will provide new possibilities and disconnection routes by CAr&#8722;Si cleavage/deprotection. In this work, commercially available and cheap disulfides are employed for the first time in this type of C(sp2)&#8208;Si bond cleavage reactions. Thus, upon irradiation with visible&#8208;light, homolytic cleavage of the disulfide give rise to the corresponding thiyl radical that allows for a radical chain mechanism. This methodology represents a mild, fast and simple approach suitable for a broad variety of simply substituted arylsilanes. Moreover, the procedure could be easily extended to natural products and therapeutic derivatives, showing its robustness and synthetic application potential.

&lt;p&gt;A straightforward, visible-light triggered desilylation of arylsilanes by thiyl radicals is presented. Silyl groups are often used to block a reactive position in multi-step organic synthesis, for which a mild cleavage at a late-stage will provide new possibilities and disconnection routes by C&lt;sub&gt;Ar&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;Si cleavage/deprotection. In this work, commercially available and cheap disulfides are employed for the first time in this type of C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)-Si bond cleavage reactions. Thus, upon irradiation with visible-light, homolytic cleavage of the disulfide give rise to the corresponding thiyl radical that allows for a radical chain mechanism. This methodology represents a mild, fast and simple approach suitable for a broad variety of simply substituted arylsilanes. Moreover, the procedure could be easily extended to natural products and therapeutic derivatives, showing its robustness and synthetic application potential.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Disentangling the Effect of Pressure and Mixing on a Mechanochemical Bromination Reaction by Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanochemical bromination of a heterocyclic sulfoximine is studied by ex&#8208; and in&#8197;situ solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. A selective and fast reaction is observed in a mixer mill, which can alternatively be induced either using the centrifugal pressure of magic&#8208;angle spinning or by solely magnetic stirring the solid entities.







Abstract
Mechanical forces, including compressive stresses, have a significant impact on chemical reactions. Besides the preparative opportunities, mechanochemical conditions benefit from the absence of any organic solvent, the possibility of a significant synthetic acceleration and unique reaction pathways. Together with an accurate characterization of ball&#8208;milling products, the development of a deeper mechanistic understanding of the occurring transformations at a molecular level is critical for fully grasping the potential of organic mechanosynthesis. We herein studied a bromination of a cyclic sulfoximine in a mixer mill and used solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy for structural characterization of the reaction products. Magic&#8208;angle spinning (MAS) was applied for elucidating the product mixtures taken from the milling jar without introducing any further post&#8208;processing on the sample. Ex situ 13C&#8208;detected NMR spectra of ball&#8208;milling products showed the formation of a crystalline solid phase with the regioselective bromination of the S&#8208;aryl group of the heterocycle in position 4. Completion is reached in less than 30&#8197;minutes as deduced from the NMR spectra. The bromination can also be achieved by magnetic stirring, but then, a longer reaction time is required. Mixing the solid educts in the NMR rotor allows to get in&#8197;situ insights into the reaction and enables the detection of a reaction intermediate. The pressure alone induced in the rotor by MAS is not sufficient to lead to full conversion and the reaction occurs on slower time scales than in the ball mill, which is crucial for analysing mixtures taken from the milling jar by solid&#8208;state NMR. Our data suggest that on top of centrifugal forces, an efficient mixing of the starting materials is required for reaching a complete reaction.

         <title>Construction of TiO2/SrTiO3 Heterojunction Derived from Monolayer Ti3C2 MXene for Efficient Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile hydrothermal method has been applied for the in situ fabrication of TiO2/SrTiO3 heterojunction, using the monolayer Ti3C2 MXene as the template and reactant. It demonstrates that the optimization of half&#8208;reaction and overall water splitting reaction is dependent on the hydrothermal reaction time respectively.







Abstract
Construction of heterojunction at the atomic scale to ensure efficient charge separation for improvement of photocatalytic water splitting is challenging. Herein, a facile hydrothermal method has been applied for the in&#8197;situ fabrication of TiO2/SrTiO3 heterojunction, using the monolayer Ti3C2 MXene as the template and reactant. It is found that the sample with the hydrothermal reaction time of 60&#8197;min exhibits the highest H2 evolution rate with the sacrificial reagent, due to the efficient charge separation of TiO2/SrTiO3 heterojunction as Ti3C2 derivative. In addition, the sample shows the best overall water splitting performance at a hydrothermal reaction time of 120&#8197;min, where TiO2 is nearly converted to SrTiO3, due to the fast kinetic process and low structural defects of SrTiO3. This work not only provides a simple strategy for the fabrication of heterojunction photocatalysts but also demonstrates the difference in optimization of half&#8208;reaction and overall water splitting reaction.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclizative Borylation of Allenyl Ketones through Carbene Boryl Migratory Insertion: Access to Densely Substituted Furyl Boronates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclizative borylation reaction of allenyl ketones has been developed. The transformation is based on carbene boryl migratory insertion using starting materials that are modularly assembled from raw building blocks. This borylation reaction is a reliable method to synthesize various borylated furans, from which previously hard&#8208;to&#8208;obtain tetra&#8208;substituted furans can be readily obtained.







Abstract
Herein the palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclizative borylation of allenyl ketones with diboron compounds is reported which involves the carbene boryl migratory insertion as the key step. This reaction features mild conditions, good functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope. Thus, it represents an efficient methodology for the assembly of diverse tri&#8208;substituted furyl boronates. In addition, a series of transformations of the resultant multi&#8208;substituted furyl boronates were conducted to provide various densely substituted furan derivatives in good yields, further illustrating the potential synthetic utility of this methodology.

Abstract
Towards unexplored intermolecular n&#8594;&#960;* interactions, presented herein are the synthesis, structure, self&#8208;assembly and function of a multicarbonyl&#8208;containing macrocycle calix[2]arene[2]barbiturate 1. X&#8208;ray single crystal diffraction reveals the presence of Cl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C=O interactions in CH2Cl2&#8834;1 host&#8208;guest complex and multiple intermolecular C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C=O interactions between molecules 1 in crystalline state. The intermolecular C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C=O interactions as attractive driving force led to unprecedented self&#8208;assembly of nanotube with diameter around 1.4&#8197;nm and inner surface engineered by aromatic rings. SEM and TEM images of the self&#8208;assembly of 1 demonstrated temperature&#8208;dependent morphologies which allows the observation of spheres at 25&#8201;&#176;C and rods at 0&#8201;&#176;C, respectively. XRD analysis indicated consistent hexagonal patterns in the self&#8208;assembly and single crystal lattice, indicating the nanotubes driven by C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C=O interactions constitute the basic structural architectures of both aggregates. The nanoscopic tubes (pores) formed in the rodlike single crystal engendering the separation of moving dyes were preliminarily investigated by a single&#8208;crystal chromatography and crystal&#8208;packed column chromatography.

         <title>Isomerically Pure Oxindole&#8208;Terminated Quinoids for n&#8208;Type Organic Thin&#8208;Film Transistors Enabled by the Chlorination of Quinoidal Core</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategy of incorporating Cl atoms in the quinoidal core has been developed to control the configuration of quinoidal compounds. Unlike the reported configurational locking approaches, this strategy can simultaneously maintain low&#8208;lying frontier molecular orbital energy levels and ensure favorable intermolecular packing. As a result, isomerically pure quinoids with high electron mobility can be obtained.







Abstract
Quinoidal compounds have great potential utility as high&#8208;performance organic semiconducting materials because of their rigid planar structures and extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation. However, the existence of E and Z isomers adversely affects the charge&#8208;transport properties of quinoidal compounds. In this study, three isomerically pure oxindole&#8208;terminated quinoids were developed by introducing chlorine atoms in the quinoidal core. The synthesized quinoids were confirmed to have a Z,Z configuration by means of 1H NMR spectroscopy, density functional theory calculations, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Importantly, the strategy of chlorination allowed to maintain low&#8208;lying frontier molecular orbital energy levels and ensure favorable intermolecular packing. Consequently, all three quinoidal compounds showed n&#8208;type transport characteristics in organic thin&#8208;film transistors, with electron mobilities up to 0.35&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, which is the highest value reported to date for oxindole&#8208;terminated quinoids. Our study can provide new guidelines for the design of isomerically pure quinoids with high electron mobilities.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The strategy of incorporating Cl atoms&lt;/b&gt; in the quinoidal core has been developed to control the configuration of quinoidal compounds. Unlike the reported configurational locking approaches, this strategy can simultaneously maintain low-lying frontier molecular orbital energy levels and ensure favorable intermolecular packing. As a result, isomerically pure quinoids with high electron mobility can be obtained.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quinoidal compounds have great potential utility as high-performance organic semiconducting materials because of their rigid planar structures and extended &#960;-conjugation. However, the existence of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; isomers adversely affects the charge-transport properties of quinoidal compounds. In this study, three isomerically pure oxindole-terminated quinoids were developed by introducing chlorine atoms in the quinoidal core. The synthesized quinoids were confirmed to have a &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; configuration by means of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR spectroscopy, density functional theory calculations, and single-crystal X-ray analysis. Importantly, the strategy of chlorination allowed to maintain low-lying frontier molecular orbital energy levels and ensure favorable intermolecular packing. Consequently, all three quinoidal compounds showed n-type transport characteristics in organic thin-film transistors, with electron mobilities up to 0.35&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is the highest value reported to date for oxindole-terminated quinoids. Our study can provide new guidelines for the design of isomerically pure quinoids with high electron mobilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Green&#8208;Emissive Copper Nanocluster with Aggregation&#8208;Enhanced Emission for Selective Detection of Al3+</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Green&#8208;emissive copper nanoclusters (Cu NCs) were synthesized at a relatively high reaction temperature (80&#8201;&#176;C) and an extended reaction time to 144&#8197;h. The photoluminescence of Cu NCs could be selectively enhanced by adding Al3+, attributed to their aggregation&#8208;enhanced emission features.







Abstract
Selective detection of Al3+ is of great significance both for the benefit of human health and environmental safety considerations. In this work, a sensitive and selective fluorescence assay for Al3+ was proposed based on the green&#8208;emissive Cu nanoclusters (Cu NCs). Different from the commonly reported works, the green emissive Cu NCs showed dual emission bands at 450 and 510&#8197;nm, attributed to the reaction product between polyvinyl pyrrolidone and ascorbic acid and the Cu core, respectively. Al3+ could induce the aggregation of Cu NCs by forming covalent bonds, which results in the enhancement of photoluminescence intensity. This enhancement phenomenon is rather selective to Al3+, which endows the detection in real samples. These results provide new insights for the fluorescence mechanisms of metal NCs, which also provided a functional luminescent material for various applications, such as chemical sensing, bioimaging and photoelectric devices.

         <title>Br&#248;nsted Acid/Base Site Isolated in a Pentanuclear Scaffold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
H+ that exists in its thermodynamically metastable state is reported. The key to success was to employ a metal&#8208;complex&#8208;based scaffold with a small cavity within its structure. By sterically isolating Br&#248;nsted acid/base sites, anomalous behaviors of H+ were observed. In addition, the unique physical and chemical properties of the isolated sites were clarified. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Masaoka and co&#8208;workers. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203253).

         <title>A Cu+/Thiourea Dendrimer Achieves Excellent Cytosolic Protein Delivery via Enhanced Cell Uptake and Endosome Escape</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intracellular protein delivery has attracted considerable attentions in the development of protein&#8208;based therapeutics, however, the design of highly efficient materials for robust delivery of native proteins remains challenging. Here, we proposed a Cu+ &#8208;based coordination polymer for cytosolic protein delivery with high efficacy and robustness. The phenylthiourea grafted dendrimer was coordinated with cuprous ions to prepare the polymeric carrier, which efficiently bind cargo proteins via a combination of coordination, ionic and hydrophobic interactions. The incorporation of Cu+ ions in the polymer greatly improves its cellular uptake and endosomal escape. The cuprous&#8208;based coordination polymer successfully delivered a variety of structurally diverse proteins into various cell lines with reserved bioactivities. This study provides a new type of coordination polymers for cytosolic delivery of biomacromolecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Widening the landscape of small molecule activation with gold&#8208;aluminyl complexes: a systematic study of E&#8208;H (E=O,N) bond, SO2 and N2O activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electronic features of gold&#8208;aluminyl complexes have been thoroughly explored. Their similarity with Group 14 dimetallenes and other metal&#8208;aluminyl complexes suggests that their reactivity with small molecules beyond carbon dioxide could be accessed. In this work, the reactivity of the [tBu3PAuAl(NON)] complex towards water, ammonia, sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxide is computationally explored. The reaction mechanisms computed for each substrate strongly suggest that all activation processes are in principle experimentally feasible. Electronic structure analysis highlights that, in all cases, the reactivity is driven by the presence of the poorly polarized electron&#8208;sharing gold&#8208;aluminyl bond, which induces a radical&#8208;like reactivity of the complex towards all the substrates. A flat topology of the potential energy surface (PES) has been found for the reaction with N2O, where two almost isoenergetic transition states can be located along the same reaction coordinate with different geometries, suggesting that the N2O binding mode may not be a good indicator of the nature of N2O activation in a cooperative bimetallic reactivity. In addition, the catalytic potentialities of these complexes have been explored in the framework of nitrous oxide reduction and oxygen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer catalysis. The study reveals that the [tBu3PAuAl(NON)] complex might be an efficient catalyst towards oxidation of phosphines (and boranes) via N2O reduction. These findings underline recurring trends in the novel chemistry of gold&#8208;aluminyl complexes and call for experimental feedbacks.

         <title>Morphology&#8208;Dependent Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission of Janus Emulsion Surfactants</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on a novel stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescent material platform that relies on an evocation of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) from tetraphenylethylene (TPE)&#8208;based surfactants localized at one hemisphere of biphasic micro&#8208;scale Janus emulsion droplets. Dynamic alterations in the available interfacial area were evoked via surfactant&#8208;induced dynamic changes of the internal droplet morphology that can be modulated as a function of the balance of interfacial tensions of the droplet constituent phases. Thus, by analogy to a Langmuir&#8208;Blodgett trough that enables selective concentration of surfactants at a liquid&#8208;gas interface, we demonstrate here a method for a controllable modulation of the available interfacial area of surfactant&#8208;functionalized liquid&#8208;liquid interfaces. We show that a morphology&#8208;dependent alteration of the interfacial area can be used to evoke an optical signal, by selectively assembling synthesized TPE&#8208;based surfactants to the respective droplet interfaces. A trigger&#8208;induced increase in the concentration of TPE&#8208;based surfactants at the liquid&#8208;liquid interfaces results in an evocation of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), inducing an up to 3.9&#8208;fold increase in the measured emission intensity of the droplets.</dc:description>

         <title>B(C6F5)3&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective Ring Opening of Cyclic Amines with Hydrosilanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strong boron Lewis acid B(C6F5)3 in combination with phenylsilane enables the regioselective cleavage of one out of two or three carbon&#8211;nitrogen bonds in cyclic secondary and tertiary amines, respectively. This amine deconstruction extends to large saturated nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, and the functional&#8208;group tolerance is good.







Abstract
Opening the ring of cyclic amines by regioselective fission of one of the carbon&#8211;nitrogen bonds greatly expands the repertoire of available nitrogen&#8208;containing skeletons. Unlike approaches starting from cyclic tertiary amines, methods that can directly open secondary amines are still scarce. The present work discloses an efficient reductive ring opening of either of these cyclic amines using PhSiH3 under B(C6F5)3 catalysis. By this, the direct transformation of unstrained cyclic amines into the corresponding acyclic amines is achieved in a simple one&#8208;pot operation. A stepwise mechanism proceeding through the intermediacy of silylammonium ions followed by reductive cleavage of a carbon&#8211;nitrogen bond was experimentally verified.

         <title>Photoredox Catalyzed Single C&#8722;F Bond Activation of Trifluoromethyl Ketones: A Solvent Controlled Divergent Access of gem&#8208;Difluoromethylene Containing Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single and selective C&#8722;F bond activation of trifluoromethyl ketones using visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis is achieved in a divergent fashion. Trapping of photo&#8208;catalytically generated difluoromethyl radical to various styrene derivatives benefitted with the formation of two essential classes of difluoromethyl&#8208;containing tetrahydrofuran&#8208;ring and linear ketones in a divergent fashion. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art dispersion&#8208;corrected DFT calculations strongly support the proposed mechanistic pathway for this novel transformation.







Abstract
Selective defluorinative functionalization of trifluoromethyl ketones is a long&#8208;standing challenge owing to the exhaustive mode of the process. To meet the demands for the installation of the gem&#8208;difluoromethylene unit for the construction of the molecular architectures of well&#8208;known pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, a distinct pathway is thereby highly desirable. Here, a protocol is introduced that allows the divergent synthesis of gem&#8208;difluoromethylene group containing tetrahydrofuran derivatives and linear ketones via single C&#8722;F bond activation of trifluoromethyl ketones using visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis in the presence of suitable olefins as trapping partner. The choice of appropriate solvent and catalyst plays a significant role in controlling the divergent behavior of this protocol. Highly reducing photo&#8208;excited catalysts are found to be responsible for the generation of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoromethyl ketone (DFMK) radicals as the key intermediate via a SET process. This protocol also results in a high diastereoselectivity towards the formation of partially fluorinated cyclic ketal derivatives with simultaneous construction of one C&#8722;C and two C&#8722;O bonds. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art DFT calculations are performed to address the origin of diastereoselectivity as well as the divergence of this protocol.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Holey Graphene Modified Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7)/C as a High&#8208;Performance Cathode for Rechargeable Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;dimensional holey graphene modified Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7)/C cathode has been successfully prepared by a simple and scalable solid&#8208;state ball milling and calcination processes with holey graphene (HG) as the conductive carrier and sodium phytate and ferrous oxalate as the precursors. The introduction of HG has greatly improved the electronic conductivity and Na+ diffusion kinetics of the electrode.







Abstract
Polyanion&#8208;type Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7) (NFPP) is a promising cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries due to its low cost and high safety. Herein, a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) holey graphene (HG) modified NFPP/C material (NFPPCHG) has been successfully prepared by a simple and scalable ball milling strategy with sodium phytate and ferrous oxalate as precursors. The introduction of HG can obviously improve the specific surface area, electronic conductivity, and ions transport performance of NFPPCHG and largely enhance its electrochemical properties. The prepared NFPPCHG delivers a high reversible capacity of 118&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;C and keeps a considerable capacity of 53&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even at an ultrahigh rate of 100&#8197;C. NFPPCHG also shows excellent performance at 55&#8201;&#176;C and &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. Moreover, in situ distribution of relaxation time analysis further demonstrates NFPPCHG has superior electrochemical kinetics. In addition, the HC//NFPPCHG full cell displays good performance, suggesting great potential of the prepared material for practical applications.

         <title>X&#8208;Ray Triggered Coordination&#8208;Bond Breakage in Dysprosium&#8208;Organic Framework and its Impact on Magnetic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The X&#8208;ray (&#955;=0.71073&#8197;&#197;) irradiation induces the breakage of Dy&#8722;OH2 coordination bond in a 3D framework Dy2(amp2H2)3(H2O)6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O (MDAF&#8208;5), forming the new phase Dy2(amp2H2)3(H2O)4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O (MDAF&#8208;5&#8208;X). The phase transition is accompanied with significant change in the magnetic properties due to the change in the coordination geometry of the DyIII ion from a distorted pentagonal bipyramid in MDAF&#8208;5 to a distorted octahedron in MDAF&#8208;5&#8208;X.







Abstract
Photosensitive lanthanide&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule magnets (Ln&#8722;SMM) are very attractive for their potential applications in information storage, switching, and sensors. However, the light&#8208;driven structural transformation in Ln&#8722;SMMs hardly changes the coordination number of the lanthanide ion. Herein, for the first time it is reported that X&#8208;ray (&#955;=0.71073&#8197;&#197;) irradiation can break the coordination bond of Dy&#8722;OH2 in the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) metal&#8208;organic framework Dy2(amp2H2)3(H2O)6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O (MDAF&#8208;5), in which the {Dy2(OPO)2} dimers are cross&#8208;linked by dianthracene&#8208;phosphonate ligands. The structural transformation proceeds in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SC&#8208;SC) fashion, forming the new phase Dy2(amp2H2)3(H2O)4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O (MDAF&#8208;5&#8208;X). The phase transition is accompanied by a significant change in magnetic properties due to the alteration in coordination geometry of the DyIII ion from a distorted pentagonal bipyramid in MDAF&#8208;5 to a distorted octahedron in MDAF&#8208;5&#8208;X.

However, the light-driven structural transformation in Ln&#8722;SMMs hardly changes the coordination number of the lanthanide ion. Herein, for the first time it is reported that X-ray (&lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;=0.71073&#8197;&#197;) irradiation can break the coordination bond of Dy&#8722;OH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the three-dimensional (3D) metal-organic framework Dy&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(amp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (&lt;b&gt;MDAF-5&lt;/b&gt;), in which the {Dy&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OPO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;} dimers are cross-linked by dianthracene-phosphonate ligands. The structural transformation proceeds in a single-crystal-to-single-crystal (SC-SC) fashion, forming the new phase Dy&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(amp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (&lt;b&gt;MDAF-5-X&lt;/b&gt;). The phase transition is accompanied by a significant change in magnetic properties due to the alteration in coordination geometry of the Dy&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; ion from a distorted pentagonal bipyramid in &lt;b&gt;MDAF-5&lt;/b&gt; to a distorted octahedron in &lt;b&gt;MDAF-5-X&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>ZnTe/rGO Composite as the Fully Zinced Conversion&#8208;Type Cathodes for Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid conversion between ZnTe and Te leads to an ultra&#8208;flat discharge plateau, and avoids &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221; of polytellurides in aqueous electrolyte. Besides, fully zinced ZnTe in graphene wrapping shrinkage when charged to Te, providing spare space to alleviate volume expansion of Te during discharge. As a result, ZnTe/rGO composite exhibits high capacity, stable output voltage and good cycle stability.







Abstract
Conversion&#8208;type cathodes for aqueous zinc ion batteries (ZIBs) can provide flat plateau slop and stable output potential, compared to general intercalation&#8208;type cathodes. The high volumetric capacity and stable output potential of Te make it a promising cathode for ZIBs, but sluggish kinetics and large volume change hinder its further application. To address these issues, we revisit fully zinced ZnTe and construct ZnTe/rGO composites as the new conversion&#8208;type cathode. The electrode undergoes a solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid conversion reaction and shows a stable output potential with ultra&#8208;flat discharge plateau slop of 0.09&#8197;V (Ah&#8201;g&#8722;1)&#8722;1. When ZnTe is de&#8208;zinced and transformed to Te during charge process, it has a volume shrinkage which generates empty space in graphene matrix for latter volume expansion of Te. The graphene matrix also improves conductivity and reaction kinetics of the cathode. Due to the combination of pre&#8208;zincation of ZnTe, graphene matrix and the elimination of &#8220;shuttle effects&#8221; process, ZnTe/rGO electrode exhibits a high and stable capacity of 186&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 300 cycling, with almost no decay after initial 10 cycles.

         <title>Distance&#8208;Triggered Distinct Aryl Migrations on Azidodiboranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two bis&#8208;haloboranes fused by biphenylene and xanthrene were employed to construct azidodiboranes but resulted in different products. The boron&#8208;boron separation distances were identified as the intrinsic factors for the pathway&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
Derived from structurally similar precursors, two different azidodiboranes went through distinct aryl migration reactions triggered by different boron&#8208;boron separation distances. Biphenylene based diborane with a shorter boron&#8208;boron distance underwent heterolateral aryl migration to form a seven&#8208;membered azadiborepin, while xanthrene based diborane with a longer boron&#8208;boron distance afforded a stable bis&#8208;azidoborane scaffold. The pyrolysis of such a bis&#8208;azidoborane led to eight&#8208;membered oxazadiborocine through homolateral aryl migration and subsequent [3+2] cycloaddition. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations unveiled that the boron&#8208;boron separation distances were the intrinsic factors for the distinct migrations.

         <title>Gas&#8208;Phase Characterization of Hypervalent Carbon Compounds Bearing 7&#8208;6&#8208;7&#8208;Ring Skeleton: Penta&#8208; versus Tetra&#8208;Coordinate Isomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hypervalent penta&#8208;coordinate carbon compounds were characterized by gas&#8208;phase techniques, including photodissociation spectroscopy and ion mobility&#8208;mass spectrometry. For a compound with moderate electron&#8208;donating ligands bearing p&#8208;methylthiophenyl substituents, coexistence of penta&#8208; and tetra&#8208;coordinate forms was revealed, highlighting the significant effects of the environments on the stability of hypervalent carbons.







Abstract
In this study, we afford explicit characterizations of the electronic and geometrical structures of recently reported hypervalent penta&#8208;coordinate carbon compounds by using gas&#8208;phase characterization techniques: photodissociation spectroscopy (PDS) and ion mobility&#8208;mass spectrometry (IM&#8211;MS). In particular for a compound with moderately electron&#8208;donating ligands, bearing p&#8208;methylthiophenyl substituents, the coexistence of tetra&#8208; and penta&#8208;coordinate isomers is confirmed, consistent with solution characterizations. It is in sharp contrast to the exclusive tetra&#8208;coordinate form (with normal valence of the central carbon atom) in the single crystal. This suggests that a non&#8208;polar environment makes the penta&#8208;coordinate structure thermodynamically most stable. This delicate difference between the tetra&#8208; and penta&#8208;coordinate structures, which depends on the environment, is a close reflection of the lower activation barrier of the SN2 reaction found in neutral solvent or gas&#8208;phase reactions.

         <title>Facile One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Polysubstituted Pyridinium Salts via Annulation of Enamines with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient and facile synthesis of highly substituted pyridinium salts through the annulation of enamines with alkynes is reported herein. A Ag2CO3/HNTf2 synergistically acting catalyst system was developed and used in a condensation reaction between carbonyl substrates and propargylamine to afford structurally diverse pyridinium salts. A mechanistic investigation shows that this one&#8208;pot transformation proceeded via selective 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization of the in situ generated propargylenamine and protonolysis of the resulting vinyl&#8211;silver intermediate. The reaction conditions are mild, and the substrate scope is broad. During the cyclization, an unusual inversion of the normal reactivity of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl systems was observed.</dc:description>

         <title>Large&#8208;Area Uniaxially Oriented Sub&#8208;5 nm Line Patterns of Hybrid Liquid Crystals Constructed by Perylene Diimide and Oligo(Dimethylsiloxane)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Construction of sub&#8208;5 nm long&#8208;range ordered structures through self&#8208;assembly has received increasing attention. Herein, a series of ODMS&#8208;based thermotropic liquid crystals (LCs) containing perylene diimide (PDI) were designed and synthesized. These LCs can form ordered nanostructures with periodic sizes around 5 nm including smectic J (SmJ), oblique columnar (Colob), and hexagonal columnar (Colh) phases with change in the volume fraction of ODMS, where the layer spacing of the SmJ phase is less than 5 nm. Thin films with parallel oriented nanolines with line width less than 5 nm can be obtained on PDMS&#8208;modified silicon substrates by spin&#8208;casting and simple thermal annealing processes. Moreover, owing to the strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction between PDI cores, these nanolines are long&#8208;range ordered with uniaxial orientation in relatively large areas (1.5&#215;1.5 &#956;m2) with over 300 continuous microdomains without pre&#8208;patterning. These nanostructures provide the possibility of preparing nanotemplates by oxygen plasma etching.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile synthesis of bis&#8208;pentafluoroarylated anthracene derivatives for n&#8208;type organic field&#8208;effect transistor applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diphenylanthracene (DPA) and its derivatives are promising semiconducting materials for p&#8208;type organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). In this study, to develop n&#8208;type semiconducting materials with an anthracene core, pentafluorobenzene was introduced into anthracene via C&#8211;H direct arylation, enabling the synthesis of various bis(pentafluorophenyl)anthracene (DPA&#8208;F) derivatives. The high reactivity of the pentafluorobenzene C&#8211;H bond allows direct arylation for synthesizing DPA&#8208;F derivatives in a single step. The introduction of strong electron&#8208;withdrawing pentafluorophenyl groups provides the anthracene derivatives with n&#8208;type semiconducting properties, in contrast to the p&#8208;type properties of the parent DPAs. Among the synthesized compounds, 2,6&#8208;bis(pentafluorophenyl)anthracene shows a high electron mobility of 0.12 &#177; 0.02 cm2/Vs and an on/off ratio &gt;106 in OFETs. The high crystallinity results in the smooth electron transport. This study provides a facile synthetic method for n&#8208;type semiconducting materials and insights into the molecular design of the positional effects of aromatic substituents on anthracene.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Bioorthogonal chemistry involves selective biocompatible reactions between functional groups that are not normally present in biology. It has been used to probe biomolecules in living systems, and has advanced biomedical strategies such as diagnostics and therapeutics. In this review, challenges and opportunities encountered when translating in vitro bioorthogonal approaches to in vivo settings are presented with a focus on methods to deliver the bioorthogonal reaction components.

         <title>Liquid Dynamics Determine Metal&#8208;N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Complex Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mechanism of metal&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complex formation from imidazolium
salts in the presence of weak bases was investigated through theoretical methods. Quantum
chemical calculations revealed that the two bases considered here, sodium acetate and
trimethylamine, exhibiting similar pK a values, both facilitate the complex formation.
However, in contrast to experiments, these calculations show a slightly lower barrier with the
amine. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that the ionic nature of the [AuCl2]&#8722; and
imidazolium ions, as well as the sodium acetate base keeps these species associated in
solution through ion pairing. This pre&#8208;association of the components produces those clusters
that are essential for the metal complex formation. The neutral amine, however, remains
mostly separated from the other reaction partners, making it a significantly less effective
base.</dc:description>

Abstract
The DNA&#8208;encoded library (DEL) technology represents a revolutionary drug&#8208;discovery tool with unprecedented screening power originating from the association of combinatorial chemistry and DNA barcoding.

,
&#8208;unsaturated ketones. The synthesis of on&#8208;DNA multi&#8208;peptidyl&#8208;ylides was performed by incorporating sequential amino acids onto a monomeric ylide. Di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetrameric peptidyl&#8208;ylides were validated for Wittig olefination and led to on&#8208;DNA 
,
&#8208;unsaturated&#8208;based peptidomimetics, an important class of intermediates. One on&#8208;DNA aryl Wittig ylide was also developed and applied to Wittig olefination for synthesis of on&#8208;DNA chalcone&#8208;based molecules. Furthermore, DOS was used successfully with electron&#8208;deficient peptidomimetics and led to the development of different heterocyclic cores containing on&#8208;DNA peptidomimetics.

         <title>Influence of Triptycene Annulation on the Photochromism of Diphenylnaphthopyrans: Entropic Control of Thermal Reversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Entropically&#8208;controlled photochromism: The proximal and distal annulation of naphthopyran with rigid triptycene leads to regioisomeric naphthopyrans, which display highly divergent photochromic behaviors. The proximate isomer is so strained that its photogenerated colored open form enjoys more freedom to resist back cyclization. This constitutes the first example of entropically&#8208;controlled photochromism for the celebrated class of naphthopyrans.







Abstract
Regioisomeric naphthopyrans annulated with triptycene, i.&#8201;e., Prox&#8208;NP and Dist&#8208;NP, display divergent photochromic behaviors. While steady&#8208;state photolysis of Dist&#8208;NP led to a very labile colored intermediate that is not observable at room temperature, Prox&#8208;NP yielded a remarkably stable species characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography as the TT isomer of o&#8208;quinonoid intermediate (Prox&#8208;NPQ) with t1/2 ca. 0.18&#8197;years at 298&#8197;K. The kinetic analysis of thermal reversion reveals that the bleaching of Prox&#8208;NPQ is entropically controlled; the steric effect due to the rigid triptycene scaffold renders Prox&#8208;NP a highly constrained system such that the photogenerated colored o&#8208;quinonoid form is more entropically relaxed. This constitutes the first instance of an entropically&#8208;controlled thermal reversion for the celebrated class of photochromic naphthopyrans. Based on the response of Prox&#8208;NP and its colored intermediate Prox&#8208;NPQ to different stimuli, namely, light, heat, and acid, the molecular system can be likened to a logic gate with the &#8216;INHIBIT&#8217; function.

         <title>The Effect of Hydrogenation on the Contest between Aromaticity and Antiaromaticity in Norcorrole</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Off&#8208;nucleus isotropic shielding isosurfaces computed using DFT show that a key feature of NiII norcorrole (NiNc), its antiaromatic &#8220;core&#8221;, a 14&#8208;membered cyclic conjugated subsystem with 16 &#960; electrons that is formally preserved in all hydrogenated norcorroles, unexpectedly becomes less and less antiaromatic in the series H2NiNc&#8722;H8NiNc, which is predicted to end in the completely nonaromatic H8NiNc.







Abstract
Magnetic shielding studies demonstrate that successive hydrogenation of NiII norcorrole (NiNc), a stable molecule combining aromatic and antiaromatic features, first weakens and then eliminates the central antiaromatic region, even though the NiNc antiaromatic &#8220;core&#8221;, a 14&#8208;membered conjugated cycle with 16 &#960; electrons, is formally preserved throughout the H2NiNc&#8722;H8NiNc series. The differences between aromatic and non&#8208;aromatic isotropic shielding distributions and nucleus&#8208;independent chemical shift (NICS) values in these hydrogenated porphyrin analogues are highlighted by comparing the results for the members of the H2NiNc&#8722;H8NiNc series to those for the aromatic NiII porphyrin complex. The results strongly support the unexpected and counterintuitive conclusion that H8NiNc will be nonaromatic, without even a trace of antiaromaticity. Based on these findings, H8NiNc is predicted to be the most stable member of the H2NiNc&#8722;H8NiNc series.

Pink and blue electrical cords represent bond formation that gives the endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;adducts, respectively, shown on the light bulbs. The electrical plugs highlight the alkyne carbons attacked by the palladium catalyst, which then undergoes transmetalation with the arylboronic acid. Typical combinations of the ligand and alkyne substituent to give endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;adducts are shown on the boxes at the end of the outlets. Methanol as solvent not only activates the carbonyl oxygen, but also promotes transmetalation with the arylboronic acid. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Tsukamoto and co&#8208;workers. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203068).

Schematic illustration of &#945;&#8208;HER2M IgG modification in a 2&#8208;step approach using a redox&#8208;activated chemical tagging and an azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition reaction.







Abstract
A highly effective 2&#8208;step system for site&#8208;specific antibody modification and conjugation of the monoclonal antibody Herceptin (commercially available under Trastuzumab) in a cysteine&#8208;independent manner was used to generate labelled antibodies for in vivo imaging. The first step contains redox&#8208;activated chemical tagging (ReACT) of thioethers via engineered methionine residues to introduce specific alkyne moieties, thereby offering a novel easy way to fundamentally change the process of antibody bioconjugation. The second step involves modification of the introduced alkyne via azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition &#8242;click&#8242; conjugation. The versatility of this 2&#8208;step approach is demonstrated here by the selective incorporation of a fluorescent dye but can also be applied to a wide variety of different conjugation partners depending on the desired application in a facile manner. Methionine&#8208;modified antibodies were characterised in vitro, and the diagnostic potential of the most promising variant was further analysed in an in vivo xenograft animal model using a fluorescence imaging modality. This study demonstrates how methionine&#8208;mediated antibody conjugation offers an orthogonal and versatile route to the generation of tailored antibody conjugates with in vivo applicability.

         <title>Light&#8208;triggered Modulation of Supramolecular Chirality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamically controlling the supramolecular chirality is of great significance in development of functional chiral materials, which is thus essential for the specific function implementation. As an external energy input, light is remote and accurate for modulating chiral assemblies. In non&#8208;polarized light control, some photochemically reactive units (e.g., azobenzene, &#593;&#8208;cyanostilbene, spiropyran, anthracene, molecular motor, etc.) were designed to drive chiral transfer or amplification. Besides, photoexcitation induced assembly based physical approach was also explored recently to regulate supramolecular chirality beyond photochemical reactions. In addition, circularly polarized light (CPL) was applied to induce asymmetric arrangement of organic molecules and asymmetric photochemical synthesis of inorganic metallic nanostructures, in which both wavelength and handedness of CPL have effects on the induced supramolecular chirality. Although light&#8208;triggered chiral assemblies have been widely applied in photoelectric materials, biomedical fields, soft actuator, chiral catalysis and chiral sensing, there is a lack of systematic review on this topic. In this review, we summarized the recent studies and perspectives in the constructions and applications of light&#8208;responsive chiral assembled systems, aiming to provide better knowledge for the development of multifunctional chiral nanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Broad&#8208;scope Syntheses of [11C/18F]Trifluoromethylarenes from Aryl(mesityl)iodonium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient methods for labeling aryl trifluoromethyl groups to provide novel radiotracers for use in biomedical research with positron emission tomography (PET) are keenly sought. We report a broad&#8208;scope method for labeling trifluoromethylarenes with either carbon&#8208;11 (t1/2 = 20.4 min) or fluorine&#8208;18 (t1/2 =109.8 min) from readily accessible aryl(mesityl)iodonium salts. In this method, the aryl(mesityl)iodonium salt is treated rapidly with no&#8208;carrier&#8208;added [11C]CuCF3 or [18F]CuCF3.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Efficient methods for labeling aryl trifluoromethyl groups to provide novel radiotracers for use in biomedical research with positron emission tomography (PET) are keenly sought. We report a broad-scope method for labeling trifluoromethylarenes with either carbon-11 (t1/2 = 20.4 min) or fluorine-18 (t1/2 =109.8 min) from readily accessible aryl(mesityl)iodonium salts. In this method, the aryl(mesityl)iodonium salt is treated rapidly with no-carrier-added [11C]CuCF3 or [18F]CuCF3. The mesityl group acts as a spectator allowing radiolabeled trifluoromethylarenes to be obtained with very high chemoselectivity. Radiochemical yields from aryl(mesityl)iodonium salts bearing either electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups at meta- or para- position are good to excellent (67&#8211;96%). Ortho-substituted and otherwise sterically hindered trifluoromethylarenes still give good yields (15&#8211;34%). Substituted heteroaryl(mesityl)iodonium salts are also viable substrates. The broad scope of this method was further exemplified by labeling a previously inaccessible target, [11C]p-trifluoromethylphenyl boronic acid, as a potentially helpful labeling synthon. In addition, fluoxetine, leflunomide, and 3-trifluoromethyl-4-aminopyridine, as examples of small drug-like molecules and candidate PET radioligands, were successfully labeled in high yields (69&#8211;81%).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Coupling of Chlorosilanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Concept article summarizes the progress of the reductive coupling of chlorosilanes by nickel catalysis. This method enables cheap, stable, and readily available carbon and silicon reagents to be coupled, offering a mild and high functional&#8208;group&#8208;tolerance route to synthesize organosilanes.







Abstract
Organosilanes play essential roles in many important research areas. The use of readily available chlorosilanes to catalytically access these compounds is synthetically appealing but remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling reaction has recently emerged as a promising protocol to arrive at this goal. This strategy allows the chlorosilanes to be coupled with various carbon electrophiles under mild conditions. These reactions afford organosilanes with improved molecular diversity, structural complexity, and functional group compatibility. This Concept article summarizes the recent advance on nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive C&#8722;Si couplings of chlorosilanes.

Ge&#8208;fused azobenzene compounds: Hypervalent compounds with a germanium(Ge)&#8208;fused azobenzene (GAz) scaffold exhibiting NIR emission despite the compact &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. The synergistic effect between a hypervalent bond and the extension of &#960;&#8208;conjugation is a novel and effective strategy for obtaining NIR emissive materials.







Abstract
A novel molecular design for showing near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission is still required for satisfying growing demands for NIR&#8208;light technology. In this research, hypervalent compounds with germanium (Ge)&#8208;fused azobenzene (GAz) scaffolds were discovered that can exhibit NIR emission (&#955;PL=690&#8764;721&#8197;nm, &#934;PL=0.03&#8764;0.04) despite compact &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. The unique optical properties are derived from the trigonal bipyramidal geometry of the hypervalent compounds constructed by combination of Ge and azobenzene&#8208;based tridentate ligands. Experimental and theoretical calculation results disclosed that the germanium&#8208;nitrogen (Ge&#8722;N) coordination at the equatorial position strongly reduces the energy level of the LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital), and the three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron (3&#8201;c&#8211;4&#8201;e) bond in the apical position effectively rises the energy level of the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital). It is emphasized that large narrowing of the HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap is achieved just by forming the hypervalent bond. In addition, the narrow&#8208;energy&#8208;gap property can be enhanced by extension of &#960;&#8208;conjugation. The obtained &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer shows efficient NIR emission both in solution (&#955;PL=770&#8197;nm and &#934;PL=0.10) and film (&#955;PL=807&#8197;nm and &#934;PL=0.04). These results suggest that collaboration of a hypervalent bond and a &#960;&#8208;conjugated system is a novel and effective strategy for tuning electronic properties even in the NIR region.

         <title>Crystal Plane&#8208;Related Oxygen&#8208;Evolution Activity of Single Hexagonal Co3O4 Spinel Particles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SECCM measurements together with SEM and AFM are used to determine the intrinsic activity of two different crystallographic planes available at a single hexagonal Co3O4 spinel particle.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline electrolyte of hexagonal spinel Co3O4 nanoparticles derived using scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) is correlated with scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy images of the droplet landing sites. A unique way to deconvolute the intrinsic catalytic activity of individual crystal facets of the hexagonal Co3O4 spinel particle is demonstrated in terms of the turnover frequency (TOF) of surface Co atoms. The top surface exposing 111 crystal planes displayed a thickness&#8208;dependent TOF with a TOF of about 100&#8197;s&#8722;1 at a potential of 1.8&#8197;V vs. RHE and a particle thickness of 100&#8197;nm. The edge of the particle exposing (110) planes, however, showed an average TOF of 270&#177;68&#8197;s&#8722;1 at 1.8&#8197;V vs. RHE and no correlation with particle thickness. The higher atomic density of Co atoms on the edge surface (2.5 times of the top) renders the overall catalytic activity of the edge planes significantly higher than that of the top planes. The use of a free&#8208;diffusing Os complex in the alkaline electrolyte revealed the low electrical conductivity through individual particles, which explains the thickness&#8208;dependent TOF of the top planes and could be a reason for the low activity of the top (111) planes.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SECCM measurements&lt;/b&gt; together with SEM and AFM are used to determine the intrinsic activity of two different crystallographic planes available at a single hexagonal Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; spinel particle.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline electrolyte of hexagonal spinel Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles derived using scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) is correlated with scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy images of the droplet landing sites. A unique way to deconvolute the intrinsic catalytic activity of individual crystal facets of the hexagonal Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; spinel particle is demonstrated in terms of the turnover frequency (TOF) of surface Co atoms. The top surface exposing 111 crystal planes displayed a thickness-dependent TOF with a TOF of about 100&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at a potential of 1.8&#8197;V vs. RHE and a particle thickness of 100&#8197;nm. The edge of the particle exposing (110) planes, however, showed an average TOF of 270&#177;68&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.8&#8197;V vs. RHE and no correlation with particle thickness. The higher atomic density of Co atoms on the edge surface (2.5 times of the top) renders the overall catalytic activity of the edge planes significantly higher than that of the top planes. The use of a free-diffusing Os complex in the alkaline electrolyte revealed the low electrical conductivity through individual particles, which explains the thickness-dependent TOF of the top planes and could be a reason for the low activity of the top (111) planes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Revisiting the Reaction of IPr with Tritylium: An Alternative Mechanistic Pathway
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the high ionization energy of imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene, the reactions of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) with oxidants have been postulated to occur via a transient NHC radical cation intermediate. Herein, we propose the alternative mechanism to explain the outcome of the tritylium reaction with IPr without the intermediacy of unstable [IPr]&#8901;+.







Abstract
Despite a recent proposal on the mechanism of a single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) process between tritylium and 2,6&#8208;bis(diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (IPr) based on evidence of transient IPr radical cation intermediate ([IPr]&#8901;+) formation, such oxidation is still contentious because of the high oxidation potential of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes. Our experimental analysis indicates that the appearance of deep purple color, previously considered to be from transient [IPr]&#8901;+, originates from a zwitterionic intermediate (3&#8201;a), not a radical cation. Here, we propose an alternative mechanism for the reaction involving tritylium and IPr. This mechanism is noteworthy for explaining how [NHC&#8722;H]+ can be generated without the formation of transient [NHC]&#8901;+, which has been frequently proposed as an intermediate for the reaction between NHC and oxidants. These results also show that a transient strong single&#8208;electron donor (3&#8201;a) could be generated by the alternative mechanism for oxidants using NHCs, which is a more feasible explanation for the reactivity of NHCs with oxidants.

         <title>One Carbon Ring Expansion of Bipyrrole to Bipyridine Enables Access to a &#960;&#8208;Extended, Non&#8208;innocent, Corrole&#8208;like Ligand</title>

         <dc:description>
Diazatriphenylene was synthesized by a double, one&#8208;carbon&#8208;insertion reaction. Following elaboration, this key precursor allowed access to an unprecedented NiII&#8208;bipyricorrole radical and a cationic square planar complex upon one&#8208;electron oxidation.







Abstract
A &#960;&#8208;extended, diaza&#8208;triphenylene embedded, mono&#8208;anionic corrole analogue and its NiII complex were synthesized from a diaza&#8208;triphenylene precursor, which was obtained from a double one&#8208;carbon insertion into a naphthobipyrrole diester. Following conversion to the corresponding activated diol and acid&#8208;catalyzed condensation with pyrrole, subsequent reaction with pentafluorobenzaldehyde afforded mono&#8208;anionic, &#960;&#8208;extended bipyricorrole&#8208;like macrocycle. Attempted NiII insertion with Ni(OAc)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O resulted an ESR active, NiII bipyricorrole radical complex, which was converted to a stable cationic NiII complex upon treatment with [(Et3O)+(SbCl6)&#8722;]. Both complexes were characterized by 1H and 13C&#8197;NMR, UV/Vis spectroscopy and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The NiII bipyricorrole radical complex is converted to a cationic NiII complex by single&#8208;electron reduction using cobaltocene. Both the cationic NiII complex and the radical NiII complex exhibited ligand&#8208;centered redox behavior, whereas the NiII remains in the +2 oxidation state.

         <title>Reduction of Nitrous Oxide by Light Alcohols Catalysed by a Low&#8208;Valent Ruthenium Diazadiene Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Decomposition of the environmentally harmful gas nitrous oxide (N2O) is usually performed thermally or catalytically. Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) is currently the most promising technology for N2O mitigation, a multicomponent heterogeneous catalytic system that employs reducing agents such as ammonia, hydrogen, hydrocarbons, or a combination thereof. We report herein the first homogenous catalyst that performs the reduction of nitrous oxide employing readily available and cheap light alcohols such as methanol, ethanol or ethylene glycol derivatives. During the reaction, these alcohols are transformed in a dehydrogenative coupling reaction to carboxylate derivatives, while N2O is converted to N2 and H2O, later entering the reaction as substrate. The reaction is catalysed by the low&#8208;valent dinuclear ruthenium complex [Ru2H(&#181;&#8208;H)(Me2dad)(dbcot)2] that carries a diazabutadiene, Me2dad, and two rigid dienes, dbcot, as ligands. The reduction of nitrous oxide proceeds with low catalyst loadings under relatively mild conditions (65&#8208;80&#160;&#176;C, 1.4&#160;bar N2O) achieving turnover numbers of up to 480 and turnover frequencies of up to 56&#160;h&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;line multidimensional NMR monitoring of photochemical flow reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work demonstrates the in&#8208;line monitoring of a flow photochemical reaction using 1D and ultrafast 2D NMR methods at high magnetic field. The reaction mixture exiting the flow reactor is flown trough the NMR spectrometer and directly analysed. In the case of simple substrates, suitable information can be obtained through 1D&#160;1H spectra, but for molecules of higher complexity the use of 2D experiments is key to address signal overlaps and assignment issues. Here we show the usefulness of ultrafast 2D COSY experiments acquired in 70 s or less, for the in&#8208;line monitoring of photochemical reactions, and the possibility to obtain reliable quantitative information. This is a powerful framework to, e.g., efficiently screen reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Three synthesis procedures of the covalent&#8208;organic framework (COF) TpPa&#8209;1 are studied with the purpose of setting the most promising one in a fast and green way, leading to a more environmentally&#8208;friendly and sustainable process. By conventional heating, good crystallinity and high BET specific surface area (SSA) up to 1007 m2g&#8208;1&#160;are achieved at oC for 3 days using water as the quintessential green solvent. However, the application of microwave radiation in the synthesis for this crystalline porous polymer allows reaction times to be shortened to 30 min while maintaining structural and textural properties (BET SSA of 928 m2g&#8208;1 obtaining yields close to 98% (versus 90% of the hydrothermal synthesis). The water&#8208;assisted mechanochemical synthesis is also an environmentally&#8208;friendly synthetic approach reaching, by heating at 170&#160;oC in a two&#8208;step process (10+10 min), high crystallinity, and the BET SSA and yield of 960 m2g&#8208;1 and 98%, respectively, for TpPa&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Dispersibility of TiO2 Nanoparticles in Less Polar Solvents: Role of Ligand Tail Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oleyl ligands are known as good dispersants for stabilizing nanoparticles in less&#8208;polar solvents; however, the structure&#8208;dispersibility relationships remain unclear. We synthesized five phosphonic acid ligands to investigate the relationship and reveal that not only regio&#8208; but also the stereochemistries of the C=C double bond in the ligand molecule, as well as the choice of solvent, are key factors to enhance dispersibility.







Abstract
Nanoparticles (NPs) are inherently prone to aggregation and loss of their size&#8208;derived properties, thus it is essential to enhance their dispersibility for applications. In less polar solvents, organic ligands containing oleyl groups are known as good dispersants due to their inefficient shell packing and inhibition of chain&#8211;chain crystallization as well as interdigitation between adjacent NPs. However, reagents with oleyl structures, such as oleic acid and oleylamine, can contain trans double bonds and saturated impurities, which might affect the chemical and/or physical properties of the NPs. Nevertheless, the effect of slight differences in surface ligand structure, including isomers, on the dispersibility of NPs has been little studied. We have synthesized five phosphonic acid ligands to investigate the structure&#8211;dispersibility relationship in detail. Dynamic light scattering and visible light transmittance revealed that not only regio&#8208; but also the stereochemistries of the C=C double bond in the ligand molecule, as well as the choice of solvent, are key factors in enhancing dispersibility.

         <title>Exciplex&#8208;forming Cohost Systems with 2,3&#8208;Dicyanopyrazinophenanthrene&#8208;based Acceptors to Achieve Efficient Near Infrared OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two new 2,3&#8208;dicyanopyrazinophenanthrene&#8208;based acceptors (A) p&#8208;QCN and m&#8208;QCN were synthesized to blend with a donor (D) CPTBF for the exciplex formation. The energy levels of p&#8208;QCN and m&#8208;QCN are modulated by the peripheral substituents 4&#8208; and 3&#8208;benzonitrile, respectively. Exciplex&#8208;forming blends were identified by the observation of the red&#8208;shifted emissions from various D:A blends with higher ratios of donor for suppressing the aggregation of acceptor. The two&#8208;component relaxation processes observed by time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence support the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) character of the exciplex&#8208;forming blends. The device employing CPTBF:p&#8208;QCN and (2:1) and CPTBF:m&#8208;QCN (2:1) blend as the emitting layer (EML) gave EQEmax of 1.76% and 5.12%, and electroluminescence (EL) &#955;max of 629 nm and 618 nm, respectively. The device efficiency can be further improved to 4.32% and 5.57% with CPTBF:p&#8208;QCN and (4:1) and CPTBF:m&#8208;QCN (4:1) as the EML, which is consistent with their improved photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs). A new fluorescent emitter BPBBT with photoluminescence (PL) lmax of 726 nm and a high PLQY of 67% was synthesized and utilized as the dopant of CPTBF:m&#8208;QCN (4:1) cohost system. The device employing CPTBF:m&#8208;QCN (4:1): 5 wt.% BPBBT as the EML gave an EQEmax of 5.02% and EL lmax centered at 735 nm, however, the weak residual exciplex emission remains. By reducing the donor ratio, the exciplex emission can be completely transferred to BPBBT and the corresponding device with CPTBF:m&#8208;QCN (2:1): 5 wt.% BPBBT as the EML can achieve EL &#955;max of 743 nm and EQEmax of 4.79%. This work manifests the high efficiency near infrared (NIR) OLED can be realized by triplet excitons harvesting of exciplex&#8208;forming cohost system, followed by the effective energy transfer to an NIR fluorescent dopant.</dc:description>

         <title>Red to Near&#8208;Infrared Emitting PyrrolylBODIPY Dyes: Synthesis, Photophysical Properties and Bioimaging Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorophores with characteristics such as deep tissue penetration, minimal damage to the biological samples, and low background interference, are highly sought&#8208;after materials for in vivo&#160;and deep&#8208;tissue fluorescence imaging. Herein, a series of 3&#8208;pyrrolylBODIPY derivatives and 3,5&#8208;dipyrrolylBODIPY derivatives&#160;have been prepared by a facile regioselective nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction (SNAr) on 3,5&#8208;halogenated BODIPY derivatives (3,5&#8208;dibromo or 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrachloroBODIPYs) with pyrroles.&#160;The installation of a pyrrolic unit onto the 3&#8208;position of the BODIPY chromophore leads to a dramatic red shift of both the absorption (upto 160 nm) and the emission (upto 260 nm) in these resultant 3&#8208;pyrrolylBODIPYs with respect to that of BODIPY chromophore. Their further 5&#8208;positional functionalization provides a facile way to fine tune their photophysical properties, and these resulting dipyrrolylBODIPYs 4&#160;and functionalized pyrrolylBODIPYs&#160;5&#160;show strong absorption in the deep red to NIR (near&#8208;infrared) regions (595 &#8208; 684 nm) and intense NIR fluorescence emission (650 &#8208; 715 nm) in dichloromethane. To demonstrate the applicability of these functionalized pyrrolylBODIPYs as NIR fluorescent probes for cell imaging, pyrrolylBODIPY&#160;6a&#160;containing mitochondrion&#8208;targeting butyltriphenylphosphonium cationic species was also prepared.&#160;It selectively localized in mitochondria of HeLa cells, with low cytotoxicity and intense deep red fluorescence emission.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Most organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emitters do not show their RTP in solution.

The thiophene inclusion increased the spin&#8208;orbit coupling associated with the radiative T1&#8594;S0 pathway allows RTP to be observed in solution for all compounds, likely assisted by protection of the emissive TTT&#8208;thiophene core from the environment by the bulky peripheral donors.</dc:description>

         <title>The Prominence of Facilitator &#960;&#8208;holes: The Classic N&#8592;N Pnictogen Bonding in Nitrobenzene&#8208;Ammonia Dimer with its Structural Elucidation and Experimental Characterization at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The nitrogen of nitro group is a paradigmatic pnictogen due the presence of a &#960;&#8208;hole and a number of studies have been performed recently on prototypical nitromethane (NM). Homodimers and heterodimers of NM are sustained by &#960;&#8208;hole driven pnictogen bonds hosted by nitrogen. To understand the effect of substitution on this &#960;&#8208;hole and thus the pnictogen bond, heterodimers of nitrobenzene (NB; phenyl substitution in place of methyl) with ammonia (AM) have been probed, as a test case, using matrix isolation infrared spectroscopy and ab initio computations. Of the four structures optimized in the potential energy surface the energetically dominant global minimum, stabilized by &#960;&#8208;hole driven O=N&#8592;N pnictogen bonding with co&#8208;operative N&#8208;H&#8592;O hydrogen bonding, was experimentally identified at low temperatures. A comparison of the pnictogen bonding of NB&#8208;AM dimers with NM counterpart (NM&#8208;AM dimers) divulged the dominance of electrostatic origin of pnictogen bonding in both the class of dimers. The reduced strength of pnictogen bonding in NB&#8208;AM dimers in comparison to NM&#8208;AM dimers was discerned, which has been established to be a consequence of the reduced electrostatic potential at the &#960;&#8208;hole of NB relative to that in NM. The strength of &#960;&#8208;hole driven pnictogen bond was directly correlated with the binding energy and the infrared shifts in the signature vibrational bands of the NB, NM and AM submolecules due to dimerization under matrix isolated conditions at low temperatures.</dc:description>

         <title>Multifunctional Intrinsically Disordered Regions in Transcription Factors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Eukaryotic transcription factors (TFs) are the final integrators of a complex molecular feedback mechanism that interfaces with the genome, consolidating information for transcriptional regulation. TFs consist of both structured DNA&#8208;binding domains and long intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) embedded with motifs linked to transcriptional control. It is now well established that the dynamic multifunctionality of IDRs is the basis for a wide spectrum of TF functions necessary to navigate and regulate the human genome. This review dissects the chemical features of TF IDRs that endow them with structural plasticity that is central to their functions in the nucleus. Sequence analysis of a set of over 1600 human TFs through AlphaFold was used to identify key features of their IDRs. Recent studies were then highlighted to illustrate IDR involvement in processes such as protein interactions, DNA binding and specificity, chromatin opening, and phase separation. To expand our understanding of TF functions, future directions are suggested for integrating experiments and simulations, from in vitro to living systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Thia&#8208;Michael Addition to&#160;alpha&#8208;Trifluoromethylacrylates for 3D Network Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thia&#8208;Michael additions (1,4&#8208;additions of a thiol to a Michael acceptor) are generally catalyzed by an external Br&#248;nsted or Lewis base. A spontaneous (uncatalyzed) Michael addition of thiols to&#160;a&#8208;trifluoromethyl acrylates is described in this article, as well as its application to the very efficient preparation of a thermoset. A thorough mechanistic investigation, based on an experimental kinetic study and on DFT calculations, is presented for the addition of arene&#8208; and alkanethiols to&#160;tert&#8208;butyl trifluoromethyl acrylate in polar aprotic solvents, unveiling a probable solvent&#8208;assisted proton transfer in the rate&#8208;determining step and a considerable lowering of the energy barrier induced by the CF3&#160;group.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Aldehyde Oxidation by a Tungsten Dependent Aldehyde Oxidoreductase from&#160;Aromatoleum Aromaticum</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In contrast to their molybdenum dependent relatives, tungsten enzymes, which operate at significantly lower redox potentials, have received little attention regarding their ability to participate in electrochemical catalysis. The bacterial tungsten enzyme aldehyde oxidoreductase from Aromatoleum aromaticum (AOR) has been immobilised on a glassy carbon working electrode to generate a functional system that can electrochemically oxidise a wide variety of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes in the presence of any of the electron transfer mediators benzyl viologen, methylene blue or dichlorophenol indophenol. Simulation of the cyclic voltammetry has enabled a thorough kinetic analysis of the system, which reveals that methylene blue acts as a two&#8208;electron acceptor. In contrast, the other two mediators act as single electron oxidants. The different electrochemical driving forces imparted by these mediators also lead to significantly different outer sphere electron transfer rates with AOR. This work shows that electrocatalytic aldehyde oxidation can be achieved at a low applied electrochemical potential leading to an extremely energy efficient process</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Four analogues of the fungal metabolites macrocidin A and Z, featuring [13]para&#8208; or [13]metacyclophanes, were synthesised from fully and orthogonally protected l&#8208;dopa instead of l&#8208;tyrosine. They were tested for antibiotic activities and for effects on the growth and persistence of microbial biofilms. Tentative structure&#8211;activity relationships and distinct differences when compared with the natural lead compounds were identified.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Derived Terephthalate Ligand Decorated TiO2 with Various Morphologies for Efficient Photocatalytic H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It has been rarely reported the morphological control of derivatives of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) in hydrothermal conditions for photocatalytic applications. We report here a family of highly efficient composite photocatalysts composed of terephthalic acid/terephthalate (TPA) and TiO2 with various morphologies (e.g., nanoparticles, nanosheets, and nanorods). The composites are synthesized by a simple one&#8208;step hydrothermal method in various solvents (i.e., H2O, HF, H2SO4, HCl, and HNO3) using Ti&#8208;based MOF (MIL&#8208;125(Ti)) as precursor. The formation mechanism of composite materials with different morphological features is discussed. Impressively, the composite of TiO2 nanoparticles/TPA synthesized using H2O as solvent under hydrothermal condition exhibits the highest photocatalytic H2 activity among the studied materials, with a photocatalytic H2 production rate of 6.38 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, which is approximately 7.5&#8208;fold higher than pure TiO2 (Degussa, P25) and prominent apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 65% at 365 nm. Furthermore, the mechanism of boosted photocatalytic H2 production is discussed.</dc:description>
