         <title>Transformation of Silyl&#8208;Protected Tetrafluorinated Thia[6]helicene S&#8208;Oxide into a Difluorinated Coronene via Induced Desilylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trimethylsilyl&#8208;protected tetrafluorinated thia[6]helicene S&#8208;oxide undergoes a more efficient transformation to difluorinated coronene than its unprotected S&#8208;oxide and S,S&#8208;dioxide counterparts. Si&#183;&#183;&#183;F interactions and in&#8208;situ&#8208;generated sulfur monoxide facilitate selective desilylation, offering mechanistic insight into this cascade transformation.








Abstract
Sulfur oxidation of thiophene rings is an effective strategy for constructing substituted and polycyclic arenes via Diels&#8211;Alder reactions, wherein each thiophene ring is converted into a benzene ring. In the context of converting helicenes into planar coronenes, tetrafluorinated thia[6]helicene S,S&#8208;dioxide undergoes a smooth intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reaction to afford the difluorinated coronene. However, the corresponding S&#8208;oxide counterpart is affected by competing side reactions that limit its utility. Herein, we demonstrate that introducing a trimethylsilyl (TMS) group onto the thiophene S&#8208;oxide ring suppresses self&#8208;condensation and enables more efficient coronene conversion than its S,S&#8208;dioxide counterpart. Unexpectedly, the TMS group is removed during the transformation, yielding both the TMS&#8208;protected and deprotected forms of the difluorinated coronene. Mechanistic investigations suggest that this desilylation arises from the combined effect of Si&#183;&#183;&#183;F interactions and in&#8208;situ&#8208;generated sulfur monoxide (SO). These findings provide insights into the reactivity control of thiophene S&#8208;oxides and demonstrate how silicon, fluorine, and SO can influence cascade transformations toward functionalized polycyclic aromatic systems.

         <title>Layered MnAl Complex Oxide Realizes the Efficient Aerobic Oxidative Transformations of 1,2&#8208;Diols and Alcohols Under Normal Pressure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and convenient catalyst based on MnAl layered double oxide (Mn2Al&#8208;LDO) has been developed for the aerobic oxidative transformations of 1,2&#8208;diols and alcohols under normal pressure without any additives. The excellent electron transfer ability and strong surface basic sites of the catalyst realize the oxidation primarily via two&#8208;electron transfer (TET), and minorly via single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) processes.








Abstract
An efficient and convenient MnAl layered double oxide (Mn2Al&#8208;LDO) catalyst has been developed. Characterization results indicated that Mn2Al&#8208;LDO exhibits an improved ability of electron transfer and increased surface strong basic sites on its surface compared to the layered double hydroxide (Mn2Al&#8208;LDH) precursor and conventionally prepared Mn2AlOx. These characters endow the Mn2Al&#8208;LDO with excellent catalytic performance in the aerobic oxidative cleavage of 1,2&#8208;diols under normal pressure without additives. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that both the two&#8208;electron transfer (TET) and single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) processes are included in the catalytic reaction, with the former being more prominent. The Mn2Al&#8208;LDO catalytic system can tolerate a broad substrate scope, including monosubstituted 1,2&#8208;diols, internal 1,2&#8208;diols, primary alcohols, secondary alcohols, and various &#945;&#8208;functionalized alcohols. Additionally, the Mn2Al&#8208;LDO catalytic system also exhibits excellent catalytic stability and shows great potential for application in cascade transformations.

         <title>Inherently Chiral Calix[4]Arene Derivatives: Concept and Enantioselective Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The past decade has seen a significant rise in the enantioselective synthesis of calix[4]arene derivatives with inherent chirality, which arises from the twisted macrocyclic structures of the linked aryl groups. This development is crucial for applications in chiral catalyst design and the creation of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials. Two main strategies have been extensively explored: the de novo synthesis of macrocycles and the desymmetrization of prochiral calix[4]arene derivatives. This review highlights the enantioselective synthetic approaches used to achieve inherently chiral calix[4]arene derivatives and offers a forward&#8208;looking perspective on future advancements in this field.








Abstract
Calix[4]arene derivatives possess chirality derived from macrocycles with twisted linked aryls and have numerous applications in chiral recognition, chiral sensors, circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials, and enantioselective catalysis. Due to their unique structural scaffolds, calix[4]arene derivatives have seen increased attention in enantioselective synthesis in recent decades. Although many achievements have been made in this area based on desymmetrization or de novo macrocycle synthesis strategies, new calix[4]arene derivatives structures and efficient enantioselective synthesis methodologies are highly desirable. This review highlights recent enantioselective synthesis strategies and provides perspectives for future developments.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of the Mirror&#8208;Image Fast&#8208;PETase by the Enzyme&#8208;Cleavable Solubilizing&#8208;Tag Strategy</title>

Abstract
Mirror&#8208;image poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) plastic&#8208;degrading enzymes have emerged as promising biocatalytic platforms due to their exceptional enzymatic stability and low immunogenicity. Currently, the sole reported mirror&#8208;image plastic&#8208;degrading enzyme, the D&#8208;form of 231&#8208;residue PET hydrolase ICCG (engineered leaf&#8208;branch compost cutinase variant), suffers from thermophilic activity requirements, which limits its practical applications. Here, the first total chemical synthesis of a mirror&#8208;image 271&#8208;residue D&#8208;Fast&#8208;PETase was presented by using an enzyme&#8208;cleavable solubilizing tag strategy. Comparative kinetic analysis revealed that D&#8208;Fast&#8208;PETase showed a remarkable increase (&#8764;20&#8208;fold within 24&#160;hours) in PET degradation efficiency compared to D&#8208;ICCG at temperatures of 37 &#176;C, making it a promising candidate for prolonged PET decomposition in open environments and holding potential in addressing microplastic&#8208;related health issues within the biomedical field. This work not only expands the chemical biology toolbox for mirror&#8208;image enzyme synthesis but also establishes D&#8208;Fast&#8208;PETase as a candidate in combating the dual crises of global plastic pollution and microplastic&#8208;associated health risks.

Currently, the sole reported mirror-image plastic-degrading enzyme, the D-form of 231-residue PET hydrolase ICCG (engineered leaf-branch compost cutinase variant), suffers from thermophilic activity requirements, which limits its practical applications. Here, the first total chemical synthesis of a mirror-image 271-residue D-Fast-PETase was presented by using an enzyme-cleavable solubilizing tag strategy.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydroperoxidation of propylene to propylene oxide (HOPO) using H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; offers several advantages over commercial methods such as the chlorohydrin process and the hydroperoxide process. This review presents a comprehensive exploration of the advancements in the HOPO, with a focus on catalyst development and reactor engineering. Various catalyst synthesis strategies, including the modulation of gold nanoparticle (AuNP) size, role, and types of support, and the potential of bimetallic nanoparticles are discussed. The catalytic properties of nickel and the reaction mechanism involved in the epoxidation are also presented. These strategies offer promising pathways to enhance catalyst stability, selectivity, and overall performance. Additionally, this article highlights the critical role of reactor engineering, showcasing the significance of different reactor configurations and feed concentrations enabling higher reactant concentrations that avert explosions. The review identifies key challenges and opportunities across different scales&#8211;nanoscale, mesoscale, and macroscale &#8211; with the aim to provide valuable insights and guidance for future advancements in the field of propylene epoxidation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The Front Cover illustrates quasiracemic binaphthyl compounds&#8212;mirror&#8208;image molecules differing in part of their structures&#8212;alternately arranged within the same crystal and emitting circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). The alternating packing of quasiracemic molecules arises from their complementary chirality, and unlike racemic crystals, the resulting structure retains chirality, which gives rise to CPL. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Ito, Y. Imai and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202501677).

Femto&#8211;nanosecond optical transient absorption and nanosecond X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopies resolve the intraligand singlet charge transfer and microsecond triplet excited states in a family of monomeric, dimeric and trimeric Zn&#8208;based photosensitizers, with the trimer showing the longest lifetime. The enhanced lifetime of the trimer is attributed to its stabilization by &#960;&#8211;&#960; and CH&#8211;&#960; noncovalent interactions of the phenanthroline ligands.

Tunable amine&#8208;functionalized silica catalysts with channel and wormhole like morphology utilized for CO2 fixation reaction into cyclic organic carbonates (COCs) from epoxides at atmospheric pressure.








Abstract
A silica catalyst with characteristic features of broad pore size distribution, large pore width and tunable basic sites was synthesized by a one&#8208;step green co&#8208;condensation synthesis method analogous to SBA&#8208;15 synthesis. The surface chemical features of the above catalyst were explored by XPS, N2 and CO2 adsorption and desorption experiments. The catalyst showed 90% conversion of styrene oxide (SO) with nearly complete selectivity toward styrene carbonate (SC) in 7&#160;hours under a solvent&#8208;free condition at a temperature of 120&#160;&#176;C with the aid of co&#8208;catalyst tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB). Moreover, the catalyst demonstrates versatility with various epoxide substrates, providing valuable insights into the cycloaddition reaction under ambient pressure conditions involving carbon dioxide. The mechanistic details of the catalytic conversion were investigated by the in&#8208;situ DRIFT studies and reported here.

         <title>Spacer Group Modified Naphthalimide with Acidichromism and Mechanochromism for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 47, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
P1 powder shows no fluorescence because of PET between tertiary amines and naphthalimide. P1&#8208;HCl powder exhibits bright blue emission because HCl can bind onto the lone&#8208;pair electrons of trimethylamine to prevent PET. The highly twisted conformation of P1&#8208;HCl has enough steric effect, contributing to obvious red&#8208;shifted mechanochromism.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescence materials are crucial in developing intelligent materials and have wide applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption. However, organic fluorescence dyes with strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; intermolecular interactions and dense molecular packing lead to inertia ability of stimuli&#8208;responsive. Here, we design and synthesize spacer group modified naphthalimide compounds (P1 and P2) with acidichromism and mechanochromism properties. Photoinduced electron transfer (PET) between naphthalimide and trimethylamine moieties quenches fluorescence of P1 and P2. Then, fluorescence is obtained when P1 and P2 interact with hydrochloric acid (named P1&#8208;HCl and P2&#8208;HCl). More importantly, the spacer group modified P1&#8208;HCl with a highly twisted conformation, preventing strong intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions and a compact packing structure, contributing to obvious mechanochromism, while P2&#8208;HCl does not. Our study provides a molecular strategy to investigate the relationship between molecular chemical structure and stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescence properties and realizes anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.

         <title>Novel Synthesis of the Antifungal Cyclic Lipopeptide Iturin A and Its Fluorinated Analog for Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 47, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iturin A is an antifungal lipopeptide with a wide range of applications. In this study, we present a novel synthesis of iturin A via enantiomeric synthesis of the &#946;&#8208;amino fatty acid and on&#8208;resin cyclization. We also obtained the (S)&#8208;epimer of iturin A, showing a dramatic loss of bioactivity, and a monofluorinated analog, which retained the bioactivity of the natural compound and can be a useful fluorine NMR probe for mechanistic studies.








Abstract
The rapid development of antifungal resistance poses a threat to the health and agricultural sectors. Iturin A, a cyclic lipopeptide with pronounced antifungal properties produced by Bacillus sp., holds promise against several pathogens. Here, a novel synthesis of iturin A is presented, which enables access to different analogs for the study of its mode of action. The route includes the enantioselective synthesis of the &#946;&#8208;amino fatty acid present in the lipopeptide structure, followed by solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis and on&#8208;resin cyclization. This robust synthesis was used to obtain natural iturin A. Furthermore, the synthesis of two analogs is described: an epimer with an inverted stereochemistry of the &#946;&#8208;amino fatty acid, which was designed to shed light on the role of this stereocenter on iturin A's bioactivity, and a monofluorinated analog to assess fluorination's impact on bioactivity and as a fluorine NMR probe for mechanistic studies. Antifungal assays against Candida albicans and Fusarium graminearum showed that the epimer of iturin A lost all bioactivity, while the monofluorinated analog retained the bioactivity of the natural compound, thus confirming its potential as an NMR probe.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rapid development of antifungal resistance poses a threat to the health and agricultural sectors. Iturin A, a cyclic lipopeptide with pronounced antifungal properties produced by &lt;i&gt;Bacillus sp&lt;/i&gt;., holds promise against several pathogens. Here, a novel synthesis of iturin A is presented, which enables access to different analogs for the study of its mode of action. The route includes the enantioselective synthesis of the &#946;-amino fatty acid present in the lipopeptide structure, followed by solid-phase peptide synthesis and on-resin cyclization. This robust synthesis was used to obtain natural iturin A. Furthermore, the synthesis of two analogs is described: an epimer with an inverted stereochemistry of the &#946;-amino fatty acid, which was designed to shed light on the role of this stereocenter on iturin A's bioactivity, and a monofluorinated analog to assess fluorination's impact on bioactivity and as a fluorine NMR probe for mechanistic studies. Antifungal assays against &lt;i&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Fusarium graminearum&lt;/i&gt; showed that the epimer of iturin A lost all bioactivity, while the monofluorinated analog retained the bioactivity of the natural compound, thus confirming its potential as an NMR probe.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ferrocene&#8208;Mediated Photochemical Reduction of Naphthol to Generate Hydrogen</title>

Excited&#8208;state quenching of 7&#8208;bromonaphthol by ferrocene leads to a reduced naphthol and H2 generation. This simple, and sustainable, system is operational at mild applied potentials under photoelectrochemical conditions.








Abstract
The storage of solar energy in chemical bonds can be achieved utilizing more sustainable first row transition metals and organic compounds. Here we show that the weak acid, 7&#8208;bromonaphthol, can generate H2 upon photoexcitation and subsequent electron transfer mediated by ferrocene under photochemical and photoelectrochemical conditions. Evidence is presented to show that near visible, UV&#8208;light absorption by 7&#8208;bromonapthol generates an excited&#8208;state molecule that is reductively quenched by ferrocene. UV&#8208;visible spectroscopy shows the buildup of ferrocenium, and gas chromatography shows the generation of H2 when an acetonitrile solution of 7&#8208;bromonaphthol and ferrocene are irradiated with 365&#160;nm light. This reactivity can be translated to photoelectrochemical conditions. In the presence of 7&#8208;bromonaphthol in acetonitrile, carbon electrodes modified with ferrocene exhibit higher current responses compared to unmodified carbon electrodes at an applied potential of just &#8722;0.3&#160;V versus the saturated calomel electrode (SCE). These results highlight the ability of ferrocene to mediate electron transfer to the naphthol molecule and the possibility to translate this reactivity into photoelectrochemical devices.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of NICOL, A Coligand Secreted Protein Mediating Mammalian Male Reproductive Tract Trans&#8208;luminal Signaling</title>

         <dc:description>
NICOL is a small protein engaged the sperm maturation in the epididymis. The recombinant expression of NICOL is low&#8208;yielding and highly heterogeneous, which retards the precise understanding of the function of NICOL. Therefore, we determined the SS pairings and succeeded in the chemical synthesis of highly pure NICOL, which is useful for the structural and functional analyses of NICOL.








Abstract
The NELL2&#8208;interacting cofactor for lumicrine signaling (NICOL) is a small protein which forms a complex with the neural epidermal growth factor&#8211;like like 2 (NELL2) and engaged in sperm maturation in the epididymis. At present, the recombinant expression of NICOL is not efficient, which limits the precise understanding of the structure and function of NICOL. In this study, we first succeeded in the chemical synthesis of NICOL with NELL2 binding affinity. The synthesized NICOL possesses correct SS bond pairing, and its secondary structure is indistinguishable from that of the recombinant protein, indicating that the synthetic NICOL will be useful for structural and functional analyses of lumicrine signaling.

         <title>Mass Spectrometric Studies of Reductive Elimination from Si(IV) Anions</title>

Reductive elimination of ArO&#9472;H (Ar = aromatic residue) bonds from pentacoordinate SiIV is characterized by mass spectrometric methods. A Hammet study of substituent effects combined with DFT calculations supports a stepwise mechanism involving a loosely bound aryloxide/hydrosilane ion&#8208;molecule complex as an intermediate.








Abstract
Reductive elimination (RE) is one of the most significant obstacles to developing main&#8208;group catalysts for bond coupling processes based on conventional oxidative addition/reductive elimination steps. Here, we report an electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) study demonstrating RE from SiIV hydrosilicates [(tmim)SiH(OArR)]&#8722; (tmimH3 = tris(3&#8208;methylindol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methane) generated in solution by oxidative addition of phenols (ArRO&#9472;H) to an anionic SiII centre (silanide) incorporated in a bicyclic cage structure ([(tmim)Si]&#8722;). The activation energy for the reductive elimination linearly decreased with the increasing electron&#8208;withdrawing character of the aryl substituents, suggesting that a negative charge develops in the para position in the rate&#8208;limiting step (RLS). In agreement with experiments, a DFT study supports an ionic mechanism in which the formation of an ion/molecule complex by transient weakening of the Si&#9472;O bond is the RLS, as would be intuitively expected from the developing negative charge in the para position. This is a rare example of direct observation of reductive elimination from SiIV to SiII and, to our knowledge, the first involving anionic species.

[FeIV(O)(TMC&#8208;NMe&#8208;im)]2+ (2) was characterized by spectroscopy and crystallography. It forms via PhIO or H2O2 under weak to strong basic conditions. Replacing N&#8208;methylimidazole with pyridine doubles the FeIV&#8208;oxo formation rate. Eyring analysis of forming [FeIV(O)(TMC&#8208;NMe&#8208;im)]2+ (2) and [FeIV(O)(TMC&#8208;py)]2+ (4) suggests a heterolytic O&#8211;O bond cleavage mechanism.








Abstract
FeIV&#8208;oxo species can be generated using hydrogen peroxide via peroxidases, where the iron heme active site has a trans&#8208;imidazole. Here, we report the synthesis of FeII(TMC) complexes bearing pendant N&#8208;methylimidazole or pyridine donors using a modified reductive amination method. The structural characterization of complex 1 using ESI&#8208;Ms spectrometry, 1H&#8208;NMR spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed a distorted square&#8208;pyramidal geometry (&#964;&#160;=&#160;0.45). The Fe&#8211;Nimidazole bond to N&#8208;methylimidazole was significantly shorter (2.066(6)&#160;&#197;) than that to pyridine (2.112&#160;&#197;), indicating stronger electron donation from N&#8208;methylimidazole. For complex 2, the corresponding FeIV&#8208;oxo species was successfully generated using iodosylbenzene (PhIO)/hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and characterized by UV&#8211;vis, 1H&#8208;NMR, FTIR spectroscopy, ESI&#8208;Ms spectrometry, and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The second&#8208;order rate constants (k2) of 2 with CHD and PPh3. are 0.14(0) and 0.50(1)&#160;M&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, respectively. In addition, the Kinetic analysis demonstrated a 1000&#8208;fold increase in the FeIV&#8208;oxo formation rate (kobs&#160;= 1.1(1)&#215;10&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 for 2; 2.7(2)&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 for 4) when 2,6&#8208;lutidine was replaced with triethylamine in the presence of H2O2. Eyring analysis revealed a heterolytic O&#8211;O bond cleavage mechanism for H2O2 (&#916;H&#8225;&#160;= 19(1)&#160;kJ&#160;mol&#8722;1, &#916;S&#8225;&#160;= &#8722;197(4)&#160;J/mol&#160;K for 2; &#916;H&#8225;&#160;= 18(0)&#160;kJ/mol, &#916;S&#8225;&#160;= &#8722;188(2)&#160;J&#160;mol&#8722;1K&#8722;1 for 4).

         <title>Zinc(II) Monomeric, Dimeric, and Trimeric Photosensitizers with Microsecond&#8208;Lived Intra&#8208;ligand Charge Transfer Excited States Investigated through Time&#8208;Resolved Optical and X&#8208;Ray Spectroscopy</title>

         <dc:description>
An array of spectroscopic methods including femto&#8208;nanosecond optical transient absorption and nanosecond X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopies resolve the singlet intraligand charge transfer (1ILCT) and triplet (3ILCT) states in a family of Monomeric, Dimeric, and Trimeric Zn&#8208;based photosensitizers with phenanthroline&#8208;derived ligands. These results are crucial toward suggesting designs of new Zn&#8208;based complexes that can be employed for energy transfer and photoredox catalytic reactions.








Abstract
ZnII photosensitizers relative to CuI complexes have received less attention due to their energetically higher metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer states. Three ZnII complexes, namely a Monomer, a bimetallic helicate, and a trimetallic helicate, bearing phenanthroline ligands are hereby studied through time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray absorption (tr&#8208;XAS) and femto&#8208;microsecond optical transient absorption spectroscopy (OTA). The formation of intraligand singlet charge transfer (IILCT) excited states is achieved within femtoseconds, followed by intersystem crossing (ISC) in nanoseconds to generate microsecond&#8208;lived triplet (3ILCT) states. Femtosecond OTA shows that the 1ILCT states in the Monomer, Dimer, and Trimer occur within 235 fs, 683 fs, and 730 fs, respectively, while nano&#8208;microsecond OTA and tr&#8208;XAS show their 3ILCT states to decay within 1.00 &#181;s, 1.48 &#181;s, and 1.51 &#181;s. The ISC from the 1ILCT to the 3ILCT state for the Trimer is 42.8&#160;ns compared to the Monomer and Dimer with ISC rates of less than 13&#160;ns. These differences arise due to the stabilization by &#960;&#8208;&#960; and CH&#8208;&#960; noncovalent interactions of the phenanthroline ligands. The dihedral and torsional angles indicate stronger ligand strains in the excited states of the Dimer and Trimer versus the Monomer. DFT calculations for the electrochemical oxidation potentials further highlight their capability in inducing photoredox processes.

         <title>Influence of Water, Vacuum, and Temperature on Surface Conditions of a Zeolite&#8208;based Molecular Sieve</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 47, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study addresses a research gap regarding commercially available zeolites. Positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) is applied to determine the size and concentration of water&#8208;free volumes at various hydration levels and to monitor minute&#8208;scale adsorption and desorption dynamics. The bead binder does not block water access to zeolite cages, and in air&#8208;dried samples, water molecules remain near Na&#8314; ions.








Abstract
Molecular sieves such as zeolite&#8208;based materials are ubiquitous in industrial separation processes. However, there is a significant gap in understanding the surface properties and adsorption mechanisms for commercial zeolites, as most research focuses on pure zeolite powders rather than industrially relevant forms. This work addresses this gap in understanding by employing advanced characterization techniques, including positron annihilation spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray fluorescence spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, liquid nitrogen sorption, and Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy, to investigate the adsorption and desorption behavior of water in commercial zeolite 13X. Our research reveals insights into the pore&#8208;filling mechanisms, the impact of material binders on adsorption properties, and the dynamics of hydration and drying processes for zeolites. Monitoring changes on a minute scale allowed the distinction between fast and slow processes leading to sample drying. The identification of positronium bound to Na+ ions indicated that water molecules remain in the vicinity of Na+ ions after air&#8208;drying zeolite 13X. These findings highlight the importance of various environmental conditions in restoring zeolite properties to baseline after hydration, with significant implications for optimizing industrial processes. This work sets the direction for further research aimed at developing more efficient and robust separation techniques.

Abstract
Two Ru(II) and Os(II) homoleptic complexes based on a phenanthroline&#8208;pyridylidene tridentate ligand have been designed to reach NIR emission by combining strong &#963;&#8208;donation, provided by the unconventional N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) pyridylidene moiety, with the low&#8208;lying &#960;&#8208;accepting phenanthroline scaffold. Detailed experimental and computational investigations of the photophysical properties of this novel family of cyclometallated complexes reveal emission squarely falling in the NIR domain peaking at &#955;em = 790&#160;nm for the Os(II) complex, while emission is hypsochromically shifted at &#955;em = 747&#160;nm for the Ru(II) homologue in deaerated CH3CN solution at room temperature. Despite the triplet metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MLCT) nature that characterizes the excited state in both complexes, density functional theory (DFT) calculations allow to ascribe the remarkable optical shift observed in the latter to the larger spin&#8208;orbital coupling (SOC) effects exerted by the heavier metal.

         <title>Engineering Alloxazines by Boron Coordination and Click Chemistry toward Small&#8208;molecule Fluorescent Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 47, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design of fluorescent molecules inspired by natural cofactors to monitor biological processes carries some intrinsic advantages. This is particularly relevant in the case of redox cofactors with innate fluorescence properties, such as flavins, and synthetic strategies toward their functionalized analogues are of high interest to modulate properties. This work reports easy access to bioinspired fluorescent alloxazines (flavin analogues) with a boron difluorocatecholate moiety and further chemical elaboration through a CuAAC (copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition) click chemistry strategy, which opens the way to easy derivatization and further addressing. This molecular approach provides a design concept that could lead to bimodal probes detectable by fluorescence and 19F NMR spectroscopy.








Abstract
Selective and strategic modification of redox cofactors offers significant advantages for the design of molecular probes, including high compatibility and affinity. This is particularly relevant in the case of redox cofactors with innate fluorescence properties, such as flavins, and synthetic strategies toward their functionalized analogues are of high interest to modulate properties.

&lt;p&gt;The design of fluorescent molecules inspired by natural cofactors to monitor biological processes carries some intrinsic advantages. This is particularly relevant in the case of redox cofactors with innate fluorescence properties, such as flavins, and synthetic strategies toward their functionalized analogues are of high interest to modulate properties. This work reports easy access to bioinspired fluorescent alloxazines (flavin analogues) with a boron difluorocatecholate moiety and further chemical elaboration through a CuAAC (copper-catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition) click chemistry strategy, which opens the way to easy derivatization and further addressing. This molecular approach provides a design concept that could lead to bimodal probes detectable by fluorescence and &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F NMR spectroscopy.

&lt;p&gt;Selective and strategic modification of redox cofactors offers significant advantages for the design of molecular probes, including high compatibility and affinity. This is particularly relevant in the case of redox cofactors with innate fluorescence properties, such as flavins, and synthetic strategies toward their functionalized analogues are of high interest to modulate properties. However, the synthetic elaboration of flavins and their alloxazine isomers still suffers from limitations.

         <title>Harnessing the Biosynthetic Diversity of Actinomycetes: Discovery of Unique Natural Products Through Comparative Genomic and Metabolic Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 47, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Comparative analysis of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (sBGCs) in Actinomycetes revealed that Pseudonocardiaceae strains possess abundant, diverse, and strain&#8208;specific sBGCs. Molecular networking&#8208;based strategy identified lentindoles A and B, novel peptides with rare 6/5/6 and 6/5/5 tricyclic scaffolds, as strain&#8208;specific metabolites from a Lentzea strain. This approach offers a promising strategy for discovering novel natural products.








Abstract
Actinomycetes, rich in biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), are important sources of natural products (NPs). However, the rate of discovering novel NPs from actinomycetes has declined, indicating the need for a new strategy to obtain NPs. Herein, we present a strategy for the efficient discovery of novel NPs. First, we performed a comprehensive analysis of BGCs in actinomycetes, evaluating the average number and types of BGCs per genus to identify prolific NP producers. Our analysis revealed that certain actinomycete strains, such as those in the family Pseudonocardiaceae, possess a greater number of BGCs than Streptomyces. In addition, these strains tend to possess strain&#8208;specific BGCs compared with others. To facilitate the identification of strain&#8208;specific compounds, we developed a comparative metabolic analysis method using molecular networking. Applying this method to eight Pseudonocardiaceae strains, we successfully discovered two novel peptides, lentindoles A (1) and B (2), featuring a 6/5/6 and 6/5/5 tricyclic ring system, respectively, along with their possible biosynthetic precursor, lentindole C (3). Our result demonstrates the effectiveness of our developed strategy, which is expected to accelerate the discovery of novel NPs.

A series of Pd(II)&#8208;NHC complexes incorporating &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;&#951;3&#8208;methylnaphthyl ligands were synthesized via a simple weak&#8208;base method. The catalytic effects of these ligands were evaluated in Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling, Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination, and Miyaura borylation reactions. The &#945;&#8208;&#951;3&#8208;methylnaphthyl variant showed superior performance, particularly in catalyst activation, compared to both the &#946; isomer and cinnamyl&#8208;based analogs.








Abstract
The development of efficient and easily accessible Pd(II)&#8208;NHC (NHC&#160;=&#160;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) pre&#8208;catalysts is presented. A series of well&#8208;defined [Pd(NHC)(&#945;/&#946;&#8208;&#951;3&#8208;MeNAP)Br] (MeNAP&#160;=&#160;methylnaphthyl) pre&#8208;catalysts has been synthesized by reacting [Pd(&#945;/&#946;&#8208;&#951;3&#8208;MeNAP)Br]2 and various NHC&#183;HCl precursors in the presence of K2CO3 in acetone. The synthesized Pd(II)&#8208;NHC derivatives displayed good to excellent catalytic activity, and rapid activation in classical Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura, Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig, and Miyaura borylation reactions. Additionally, the synthesis of [Pd(IPr)(&#945;&#8208;&#951;3&#8208;MeNAP)Br] (IPr&#160;=&#160;1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) was successfully achieved employing aqueous ammonia as the base.

         <title>Tuning the 2LMCT Deactivation of Cyclometalated Iron Carbene Complexes with Electronic Substituent Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 47, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bromo&#8208; or furanyl&#8208;substituents on a cyclometalated iron(III) N&#8208;heterocyclic complex stabilize the 2LMCT state to very different extent. With substantially different 2LMCT energies and lifetimes, the two cases illustrate the balance between non&#8208;radiative deactivation directly to the ground state or via metal&#8208;centered states.








Abstract
FeIII complexes based on the [FeIII(ImP)2]+ motif (ImP&#160;=&#160;bis(2,6&#8208;bis(3&#8208;methylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene&#8208;1&#8208;yl)phenylene)), where the ligand contains both carbene and cyclometalated moieties, are a promising class of photoactive materials made from this abundant metal. In this work, it is shown that bromo or furanyl substituents attached to the cyclometalating moiety of the ImP ligands stabilize the 2LMCT excited state to very different extent resulting in opposing effects on the 2LMCT lifetime. For [FeIII(ImPBr)2]+, the lifetime (255&#160;ps) of its moderately stabilized 2LMCT state (1.85&#160;eV) is slightly increased compared to the parent complex (1.90&#160;eV, 240&#160;ps) pointing to an increased barrier for deactivation via the 4MC state and enabling applications as photoredox catalyst. In contrast, the 2LMCT energy of [FeIII(ImPFur)2]+ is lowered substantially to a value of 1.63&#160;eV due to the extended &#960;&#8208;system of the ligands and the reduced energy gap favors internal conversion directly to the ground state resulting in a considerably reduced 2LMCT lifetime of 59&#160;ps. These findings have general implications for design of ligand modifications aiming at extended LMCT lifetimes and/or modified ground and excited state potentials.

In this work, it is shown that bromo or furanyl substituents attached to the cyclometalating moiety of the ImP ligands stabilize the &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;LMCT excited state to very different extent resulting in opposing effects on the &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;LMCT lifetime. For [Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(ImPBr)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, the lifetime (255&#160;ps) of its moderately stabilized &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;LMCT state (1.85&#160;eV) is slightly increased compared to the parent complex (1.90&#160;eV, 240&#160;ps) pointing to an increased barrier for deactivation via the &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;MC state and enabling applications as photoredox catalyst. In contrast, the &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;LMCT energy of [Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(ImPFur)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is lowered substantially to a value of 1.63&#160;eV due to the extended &#960;-system of the ligands and the reduced energy gap favors internal conversion directly to the ground state resulting in a considerably reduced &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;LMCT lifetime of 59&#160;ps. These findings have general implications for design of ligand modifications aiming at extended LMCT lifetimes and/or modified ground and excited state potentials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chirality&#8208;Controllable Self&#8208;Sorting in Macrocyclic Supramolecular Assemblies: Homochiral and Heterochiral 1D Architectures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 47, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral self&#8208;sorting, involving narcissistic and social pathways, generates homochiral and heterochiral supramolecular assemblies. Herein, guest moieties with different rigidity were introduced into macrocyclic pillar[5]arene hosts to regulate chiral sequences. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis shows that rigid guests induce homochiral sequences, while flexible ones favor heterochiral sequences, enabling controlled chiral sequences in macrocyclic supramolecular systems.








Abstract
Chiral self&#8208;sorting, including both narcissistic and social self&#8208;sorting, can generate homochiral and heterochiral supramolecular assemblies, respectively. However, achieving control over both pathways through molecular design remains challenging. Herein, we designed a series of macrocyclic pillar[5]arene derivatives with linear chains that thread into the cavities of adjacent molecules in the crystal, forming 1D superstructures. By varying the rigidity of these linear chains, we discovered that the rigidity dictated chiral preference: rigid chains induced homochiral arrangements, whereas flexible chains favored heterochiral arrangements. Mechanistically, the close packing of adjacent pillar[5]arenes through host&#8211;guest supramolecular system played a crucial role in controlling the chiral sequence.

         <title>Long Used but Hardly Known: Synthesis and Crystal Structure of Tritium Breeding Li2Be2O3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 47, August 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ternary oxide Li2Be2O3 was synthesized in a HT approach starting from Li2O and BeO using a radiofrequency furnace. Although, the compound has been known for almost 60 years, its crystal structure has only now been elucidated and a phase&#8208;pure synthesis makes the determination of directly assignable properties possible. Li2Be2O3 is discussed for its usage in fusion reactors, as it breeds essential tritium under neutron irradiation.








Abstract
A main challenge for the operation of a nuclear fusion reactor is the consumption of tritium during the fusion process and the limited availability of tritium in natural resources or its production in nuclear power plants. The most promising approach is breeding of new tritium within the operating fusion reactor. For this purpose, suitable breeding materials are needed. Lithium beryllium oxides are a promising class of compounds, as they unite both target and neutron multiplier in one material. While there have already been studies on sintered ceramics in the Li2O&#183;BeO system, the crystal structure of compounds of a defined composition has so far remained unsolved. Herein, we report on the synthesis of phase&#8208;pure Li2Be2O3 in a high&#8208;temperature (HT) approach and its structure determination by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (sc&#8208;XRD). In addition, the compound was characterized by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. The thermal stability, which is important for use as blanket material in a fusion reactor, was examined with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).

         <title>Pyrrole&#8208;Imine Macrocycle: Self&#8208;Organizing Cross&#8208;Reactive Anion Receptor and Sensor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An imine macrocycle comprising pyrroles as hydrogen&#8208;bond donors and an environmentally sensitive fluorophore displays a wide cross&#8208;reactive binding, which, in combination with an analyte&#8208;specific fluorescence response allows differentiation between ten analytes and their concentrations. Thus, one cross&#8208;reactive sensor performs the work of multiple, essentially acting as a &#8220;sensor array of one molecule&#8221;.








Abstract
Self&#8208;organizing macrocyclic receptor&#8208;sensors for phosphorus oxyanions, phosphates, and phosphonates comprising imine moieties were prepared by condensation of dipyrrolylmethane dicarbaldehyde with diethylene triamine. The incorporation of flexible ethylene moieties endows the macrocycle with unprecedented flexibility and ability to accommodate numerous phosphorus oxyanions from orthophosphate to large anions such as ATP or phosphonate glyphosate. The anion binding was elucidated by NMR titrations, low&#8208;temperature NMR, and NOESY NMR. The incorporation of dansyl fluorophore enables sensing of anions using the fluorescence signal, whereas the changes in fluorescence intensity, width of the fluorescence band, and position of the maxima are analyte&#8208;specific and useful in recognition and identification of eleven different P&#8208;oxyanions in water. The affinity (Kassoc) for Na+ salts was H2PO4&#8722; &#8776; Methylphosphonate&#160;&gt;&#160;H2P2O72&#8722; &gt; Phenylphosphonate&#8208;&#160;&gt;&#160;Glyphosate2&#8208;&#160;&gt;&#160;AMP2&#8208; &gt; ADP2&#8722; &gt; ATP2&#8722;. Interestingly, phosphonates, including methylphosphonate and glyphosate anions, were also found to display a strong affinity (Kassoc&#160;&#8764;106 M&#8722;1) while halides, nitrate, carbonates, or hydrogen sulfate did not show a significant affinity. The determined fluorescence spectral parameters were used to classify the 12 analytes (11 anions and water) using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Quantification was performed using LDA and Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the phosphonate concentrations in unknown samples were determined with an error of 3.5% or lower.

         <title>Beyond Neuroprostanes: Total Synthesis and Epilipidomic Studies of a Novel Cyclopentenone Metabolite of Docosahexaenoic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neuroprostanes are bioactive oxylipins from docosahexaenoic acid oxidation, serving as oxidative stress biomarkers. In this work, the enantioselective synthesis of 4&#8208;A4&#8208;NeuroP&#8208;1,4&#8208;lactone and 4&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#916;4,6&#8208;A4&#8208;NeuroP has been accomplished using Michael addition, olefin metatheses, and Wittig olefinations as key steps. Notably, 4&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#916;4,6&#8208;A4&#8208;NeuroP was detected for the first time in trout brains, underscoring its biological significance.








Abstract
Neuroprostanes (NeuroPs) are bioactive oxylipins formed in vivo from docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), the main polyunsaturated fatty acid of the human brain, by a nonenzymatic auto&#8208;oxidative process as mixtures of regio&#8208; and diastereoisomers. Thus, synthetic material is necessary to unlock their potential as oxidative stress biomarkers as well as to investigate the biological properties of individual NeuroP molecules. Despite recent advances in the field, cyclopentenone&#8208;type NeuroPs have received limited attention. Here, we present an enantioselective total synthesis of 4&#8208;A4&#8208;NeuroP&#8208;1,4&#8208;lactone and its dehydrated metabolite, 4&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#916;4,6&#8208;A4&#8208;NeuroP. The asymmetric synthesis of the chiral core relies on a robust organocatalyzed Michael addition. The assembly of the full carbon framework was accomplished via selective double olefin metathesis and Wittig olefination. The MS2 spectra of the 4&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#916;4,6&#8208;A4&#8208;NeuroP was carefully studied using molecular network and quantum chemistry software to elucidate its unique fragmentation pattern. Also, preliminary analytical studies showed for the first&#8208;time tangible amounts of 4&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#916;4,6&#8208;A4&#8208;NeuroP in trout brains.

Despite recent advances in the field, cyclopentenone-type NeuroPs have received limited attention. Here, we present an enantioselective total synthesis of 4-A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-NeuroP-1,4-lactone and its dehydrated metabolite, 4-deoxy-&#916;&lt;sup&gt;4,6&lt;/sup&gt;-A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-NeuroP. The asymmetric synthesis of the chiral core relies on a robust organocatalyzed Michael addition. The assembly of the full carbon framework was accomplished via selective double olefin metathesis and Wittig olefination. The MS2 spectra of the 4-deoxy-&#916;&lt;sup&gt;4,6&lt;/sup&gt;-A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-NeuroP was carefully studied using molecular network and quantum chemistry software to elucidate its unique fragmentation pattern. Also, preliminary analytical studies showed for the first-time tangible amounts of 4-deoxy-&#916;&lt;sup&gt;4,6&lt;/sup&gt;-A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-NeuroP in trout brains.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Evaluation of DNA Cross&#8208;linkers by Click Chemistry&#8208;Mediated Heterodimerization of Nor&#8208;Tomaymycins</title>

         <dc:description>
Click chemistry promises a simple method to produce pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;c][1,4]benzodiazepine (PBD)&#8208;based DNA binders. DNA binding and covalent crosslinking capabilities have been validated for &#8216;clicked&#8217; PBD heterodimers using thermal denaturation analysis, mass spectrometry and DNase I footprinting. One dimer induced strong DNA cross&#8208;linking and cellular cytotoxicity, indicating the future potential for dimerization in living cells.








Abstract
The covalent cross&#8208;linking of DNA duplex strands by small molecule drugs is a validated mechanism in anticancer therapy. The pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;c][1,4]benzodiazepines (PBDs) have been established as potent DNA binders that can achieve inter&#8208; and intrastrand DNA cross&#8208;links when dimerized, and have been used as cytotoxic payloads in multiple antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs). In this study, we explore the potential of click chemistry to obtain PBD heterodimers. The heterodimers D1&#8211;D4 were prepared by copper catalyzed or strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloadditions (SPAACs) from the corresponding monomers M1 &#8211; M4 and MbA. The interactions of monomers and dimers with DNA were evaluated by DNA thermal denaturation analysis, a newly developed mass spectrometry&#8208;based method for the detection of single stand and double strand modifications, and by DNase I footprinting. All methods demonstrated the DNA binding and cross&#8208;linking capabilities of D1. Testing for cytotoxicity in three cell lines revealed that the monomers M1 and M4 and the dimers D1 and D4 were the most potent. The click chemistry approach opens an easy access to larger libraries of PBD&#8208;based DNA binders, including the option for dimerization in live cells.

         <title>Alternating Orthogonal Switching in a Thiophenyl&#8208;Phenyl&#8208;Bis&#8208;Azobenzene Switch</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study employs computational calculations and ultrafast spectroscopy to design and probe alternate isomerization in a bis&#8208;azobenzene molecule. The phenyl&#8208; and thiophenylazobenzene moieties exhibit independent switching under different wavelengths, advancing multi&#8208;photoswitch applications.








Abstract
To design efficient molecular information storage systems with multi&#8208;photoswitchable entities, orthogonal isomerization of the different switchable moieties is essential. Various challenges, like unintentional energy transfer, spectral overlap, and other energy dissipation channels, have to be addressed by intelligent molecule design. In this context, we took advantage of calculations to design a bis&#8208;azobenzene switch, which consists of a phenyl&#8208; and a thiophenylazobenzene moiety in meta&#8208;connection to reduce &#960;&#8208;conjugation. Ultrafast spectroscopy and computational studies confirmed that this bis&#8208;photoswitch exhibits alternating orthogonal switching behavior when irradiated with light of different wavelengths. These results represent a significant advancement toward the development of efficient and adaptable organic multi&#8208;photoswitches for applications, such as information storage, molecular machines, or smart materials.

         <title>Circular Dichroism and Multiphoton Circularly Polarized Luminescence Switching Using a Bis&#8208;perylene Diimide Macrocycle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral and configurationally stable bis&#8208;perylene diimide macrocycle is reported, which exhibits switchable circular dichroism (CD) and multiphoton circularly polarized luminescence (MP&#8208;CPL). This behavior is realized due to the macrocycle's tuneable chiral conformation, which impacts the intrinsic and supramolecular helicity of the perylene diimide dimer.








Abstract
Chiroptical switches exhibit stimuli&#8208;induced changes in the sign or strength of their circular dichroism (CD) or circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and are materials with significant potential for chiroptical sensing and biological imaging. However, the chromophores used in chiroptical materials usually require excitation by ultraviolet or visible light, which results in higher cytotoxicity and lower penetration compared to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photoexcitation. This can be overcome by multiphoton excitation, yet multiphoton CPL (MP&#8208;CPL) has been challenging to measure in organic emitters. Core&#8208;twisted perylene diimides (PDIs) are excellent chromophores with which to develop MP&#8208;CPL emitters due to a chiral &#960;&#8208;system capable of two&#8208;photon absorption. Furthermore, the integration of these chiral PDIs into stimuli&#8208;responsive macrocycles affords configurational stability and the potential for chiroptical switching, due to the chromophore's tuneable chiral conformation. In this work we report a chiral bis&#8208;PDI macrocycle with stable, yet conformationally dynamic, enantiomers, and in doing so realize a novel chiroptical material that combines switchable CD and MP&#8208;CPL for the first time.

         <title>Zincophilic MOF Protective Layer for Stable Zinc Anodes in Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are under the spotlight due to their substantial potential, abundant natural resources, inherent safety, and high specific capacity. However, uncontrollable zinc dendrite growth and side reactions on the zinc surface hinder the application of ZIBs. In this article, a uniform copper&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) coating layer was fabricated on a zinc metal surface (CuZIF@Zn) to serve as a protective interface. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray techniques were employed to study the electrode structure before and after cycling. With its special structure, the MOF interfacial layer acts as an effective barrier layer to isolate the zinc anode from water molecules and electrolyte, thereby suppressing interfacial side reactions and passivation. Additionally, the abundance of zincophilic sites in the CuZIF layer ensures uniform deposition of Zn2+ while effectively inhibiting the growth of dendritic structures. Consequently, the CuZIF@Zn//CuZIF@Zn symmetric batteries exhibited cycling stability over 1000 cycles at 1.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, attributed to the protective layer. Furthermore, a full cell incorporating an MnO2 cathode maintained 189 mAh g&#8722;1 over 700 cycles, demonstrating remarkable long&#8208;term cycling performance.

         <title>Interfacial Co&#8208;Operativity Enables Ultrafast Charge Transfer Within the Co&#8208;Fe Prussian Blue Analogue|Zno Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This combined spectroscopic study shows that when the interfacial composition of PBA|ZnO heterostructure is engineered via a facile synthetic protocol the interfacial CT is promoted by a cooperative mechanism. In this mechanism, pre&#8208;existing oxidized PBA units at the interface facilitate structural rearrangements within the coordination network, thereby lowering the kinetic barrier of the process and improving its water oxidation efficiency.








Abstract
Heterostructures of Cobalt&#8208;Iron (Co&#8208;Fe) Prussian blue analogues (PBA) and inorganic semiconductors are attractive materials for photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical water oxidation. Their efficiency is rooted in the charge transfer (CT) at the PBA|semiconductor interface. The interfacial CT, however, often suffers from sluggish kinetics, optimization of which has been elusive. In this work, we investigate PBA|ZnO heterostructures spectroscopically and show that tuning the interfacial composition of the heterostructure presents a synthetic handle to significantly improve interfacial CT. We employ ultrafast transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy to probe the CT kinetics, while interface&#8208;sensitive vibrational spectroscopy, that is, time&#8208;resolved and in&#8208;situ vibrational sum&#8208;frequency generation (VSFG), sheds light on the molecular response to the CT across the interface. These measurements reveal that cooperative intermolecular interactions at the PBA|ZnO interface are key to achieving efficient CT. Furthermore, we relate the CT observed on ps&#8208;timescales to the functional properties of the PBA|ZnO heterostructure in terms of photocatalytic water oxidation, which increases by about 200% in absolute yield as compared to a heterostructure without interfacial co&#8208;operativity. Thus, this work presents for the first time a molecular picture of a PBA|ZnO interface and offers a novel perspective to optimize the CT dynamics in PBA|semiconductor heterostructures by tuning the interfacial chemical structure of PBA.

     alt="Interfacial Co-Operativity Enables Ultrafast Charge Transfer Within the Co-Fe Prussian Blue Analogue|Zno Heterostructure"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This combined spectroscopic study shows that when the interfacial composition of PBA|ZnO heterostructure is engineered via a facile synthetic protocol the interfacial CT is promoted by a cooperative mechanism. In this mechanism, pre-existing oxidized PBA units at the interface facilitate structural rearrangements within the coordination network, thereby lowering the kinetic barrier of the process and improving its water oxidation efficiency.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heterostructures of Cobalt-Iron (Co-Fe) Prussian blue analogues (PBA) and inorganic semiconductors are attractive materials for photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical water oxidation. Their efficiency is rooted in the charge transfer (CT) at the PBA|semiconductor interface. The interfacial CT, however, often suffers from sluggish kinetics, optimization of which has been elusive. In this work, we investigate PBA|ZnO heterostructures spectroscopically and show that tuning the interfacial composition of the heterostructure presents a synthetic handle to significantly improve interfacial CT. We employ ultrafast transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy to probe the CT kinetics, while interface-sensitive vibrational spectroscopy, that is, time-resolved and in-situ vibrational sum-frequency generation (VSFG), sheds light on the molecular response to the CT across the interface. These measurements reveal that cooperative intermolecular interactions at the PBA|ZnO interface are key to achieving efficient CT. Furthermore, we relate the CT observed on ps-timescales to the functional properties of the PBA|ZnO heterostructure in terms of photocatalytic water oxidation, which increases by about 200% in absolute yield as compared to a heterostructure without interfacial co-operativity. Thus, this work presents for the first time a molecular picture of a PBA|ZnO interface and offers a novel perspective to optimize the CT dynamics in PBA|semiconductor heterostructures by tuning the interfacial chemical structure of PBA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Steric and Geometric Tuning of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Antennae in Europium(III) Complexes for Selective ADP Recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present four new macrocyclic Eu(III) complexes and demonstrate how ligand structure and positional tuning of &#960;&#8208;conjugated antennae modulate steric demand and anion binding site geometry. This enables size and shape complementarity for selective ADP recognition in water over competing phosphoanions.









Abstract
The selective recognition of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) in water presents a significant challenge for synthetic supramolecular chemistry, driven by its biological importance in cellular energy transfer and enzymatic signaling pathways. Discriminating ADP from structurally similar anions such as ATP requires a high degree of host&#8211;guest complementarity. We recently developed [Eu.ADPGlow]&#8722;, a luminescent Eu(III) complex bearing two 6&#8208;substituted quinolyl&#8208;phenoxyacetate arms, which create a binding site at the central Eu(III) ion that accommodates ADP. Binding induces a tight interaction in water, involving both metal coordination and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, switching the emission on with a 33&#8208;fold enhancement. Here, we examine how systematic changes in ligand geometry influence anion selectivity, by synthesizing four new Eu(III) complexes with pendant arms at the 4&#8208; or 7&#8208;positions of the quinoline scaffold. The 4&#8208;substituted systems provide a more accessible binding site and bind ADP, ATP, and AMP with limited selectivity between them, while the 7&#8208;substituted analogues impose steric hindrance at the Eu(III) center, resulting in minimal response to all tested anions. Only the 6&#8208;substituted complex [Eu.ADPGlow]&#8722; achieves optimal geometrical complementarity for ADP binding. These findings reinforce the importance of steric and geometric control in the design of selective lanthanide probes for biological anions in water.

         <title>Direct Visualization of Plasmon&#8208; Induced Hole Injection in Electroactive Luminescent Monolayers on Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the ability of plasmons to switch on the fluorescence of molecular monolayers through a hole injection process, in combination with an electrochemical reduction triggered at the tip and transferred to the monolayer by a redox mediator.








Abstract
A dual and simultaneous modulation of fluorescence intensity and electrochemical current induced by plasmon activation is demonstrated using a combination of electrochemical (SECM) and fluorescence microscopies, employing fluorescent redox monolayers grafted onto gold nanoparticles. The observed electrochemical and optical responses are fully consistent with a direct hole injection from the plasmonically excited metallic nanoparticles into the grafted monolayer. In particular, an unprecedented fluorescence intensity enhancement occurs upon simultaneous electroreduction at the tip and plasmon activation, whereas each process taken separately leads to a fluorescence quenching. The electrochemical current enhancement is significantly larger for functionalized nanoparticles compared to bare ones under plasmon activation, opening the route toward new strategies in photoelectrocatalysis.

         <title>Intepirdine Derivatives Possessing Dual 5HT6 Antagonism / HDAC6 Inhibitory Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the context of developing therapies for dementias and cognitive decline, potent dual acting molecules targeting the GPCR 5HT6 and the enzyme HDAC6 with favorable BBB penetration profile were designed and synthesised.








Abstract
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) impacts significantly the quality of life of people aged over 65 years old, while millions more suffer from other types of dementia, yet no effective drugs exist. The few approved drugs in this area address mostly the associated symptoms, while several selective agents acting on promising targets have failed in clinical trials. The complexity of neurodegenerative diseases has prompted multitargeting ligands as the new paradigm, where more than one biological mechanism may be perturbed synergistically. In this context, we explored the design and synthesis of dual 5&#8208;&#919;&#932;6&#160;antagonists / HDAC6 inhibitors since these actions have been individually demonstrated to elicit cognitive&#8208;enhancing effects. Prototypes with this dual action on a GPCR and an enzyme were designed and synthesized by tethering an aryl&#8208;hydroxamic acid unit, an established pharmacophore for HDAC6 inhibition, to the piperazine of intepirdine, a potent 5&#8208;&#919;&#932;6&#160;antagonist.&#160;A new gram&#8208;scale synthesis of intepirdine was&#160;developed&#160;followed&#160;by&#160;attaching&#160;different types of arylhydroxamic acids.&#160;Derivative RG&#8208;283AG emerged to possess sub&#8208;micromolar potency toward HDAC6 inhibition (IC50&#160;0.54 &#956;&#956;), nanomolar affinity (Ki&#160;0.7&#160;nM) for 5&#8208;HT6&#160;receptor and favorable BBB penetration capacity, thus constituting the first example of a dual&#8208;acting 5&#8208;&#919;&#932;6&#160;/ HDAC6 ligand with potential cognitive&#8208;enhancing properties.

         <title>Ru(II)&#8208;Based Photo&#8208;Antibiotics: Light&#8208;Driven Eradication of Bacterial Biofilm and Rapid Healing of Infective Wounds in Wistar Rat</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the development of biocompatible&#160;Ru(II)&#8208;based photo&#8208;antibiotics that increase oxidative stress via ROS generation (both type I and type II pathways) and NADH oxidation, killing bacterial cells and eradicating bacterial biofilm with a novel mechanism. Moreover, the lead photo&#8208;antibiotics eradicated the gram&#8208;negative bacterial colony from the infected wounds in a rat model within 3 days and healed the wound completely within 9 days, bridging the gap between aPDT outcomes and clinical trials.








Abstract
Three novel Ru(II)&#8208;based photoantibiotics,&#160;viz., [Ru(phtpy)(N,N,N)2](PF6)2, where N,N,N&#160;=&#160;4&#8242;&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8243;&#8208;terpyridine (phtpy, Ru1), 4&#8208;([2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridin]&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;yl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethylaniline (NMe2tpy, Ru2), trifluoromethylphenyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine (CF3tpy, Ru3) were developed with excellent photostability for visible light&#8208;activated antibacterial activities and infective wound healing. Ru1&#8208;Ru3&#160;exhibited an absorption in the 400&#8211;600&#160;nm range, beneficial for antibacterial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) application. Upon visible light exposure (400&#8208;700&#160;nm),&#160;Ru1&#8208;Ru3&#160;inhibited bacterial growth of Escherichia coli (E. coli), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis), due to the effects of oxidative stress via ROS generation and photo&#8208;oxidation of NADH. Ru3 was identified as a lead antibiotic that further showed antibiofilm activities against E. coli under visible light exposure. Ru3 was found to be biocompatible against rat red blood cells and human embryonic kidney cells. Ru3&#160;+&#160;light promoted rapid healing of infected wounds within 9 days in an E. coli&#8208;induced rat model, highlighting its potential future use in healthcare.

         <title>Substrate Epoxidation Catalyzed by the Nonheme Iron Dioxygenase Dapdiamide Biosynthesis Enzyme C. Why Is the Substrate Tethered?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work a computational study shows the differences in binding and catalysis of a nonheme iron oxygenase with tethered versus nontethered substrate. The tethered substrate is positioned in an ideal orientation near the active site, while the nontethered substrate shows more dynamics and is not positioned well for double bond epoxidation.









Abstract
Enzymes usually react with a free substrate, although some examples have appeared in the literature of enzymes that utilize a substrate tethered to a protein carrier. However, it is not clear what advantage the tethering has, and therefore a computational study was performed. In particular, we report here the first computational study on the nonheme iron dioxygenase involved in the epoxidation reaction during the dapdiamide biosynthesis (DdaC) and investigate tethered and nontethered substrates. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations show that the protein carrier applies pressure onto the surface of the protein and influences the fold and active site description and leads to differences in substrate&#8208;oxidant interactions. Quantum chemical calculations give much lower epoxidation barriers for the activation of the tethered substrate by 7&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1 over the nontethered substrate and highlight the advantage of a tethered substrate in catalysis.

         <title>Nucleoside Reactions Shed Light on the Chemical Processes Underlying Interstrand Cross&#8208;Link Formation at Apurinic/Apyrimidinic Sites in Duplex DNA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites in DNA can give rise to interstrand cross&#8208;links via reactions of the ring&#8208;opened AP&#8208;aldehyde residue with the exocyclic amino groups of 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine, 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyguanosine, and 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxycytosine residues (dA, dG, and dC) on the opposing strand to give imine/N&#8208;glycosylamine linkages. Endogenous AP&#8208;derived cross&#8208;links in cellular DNA could contribute to cancer, aging, and neurodegeneration. The yields of AP&#8208;derived cross&#8208;links produced by the various nucleobases vary widely, and, until now, it remained unclear whether these differences might simply reflect differences in the inherent reactivities of the nucleobases. To shed light on this question, we examined reactions of a nucleosidic AP model compound, 3,5&#8208;bis&#8208;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;ribofuranose (1), with the canonical nucleosides (dA, dG, and dC) and the noncanonical nucleoside, 2&#8208;aminopurine&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyriboside (2AP). The trends observed for the equilibrium yields of the nucleoside cross&#8208;links did not mirror yields of the respective cross&#8208;links observed in the context of duplex DNA. The results provide evidence that the inherent reactivity of the nucleobases alone does not determine yields of AP&#8208;derived cross&#8208;links in duplex DNA. Rather, the differences in yields for the various AP&#8208;derived cross&#8208;links must reflect effects exerted by the 3D structure of double helical DNA on the cross&#8208;linking processes.

         <title>Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Multi&#8208;Carbon Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent progress in photocatalytic CO2 reduction toward multi&#8208;carbon products, emphasizing key advances in catalyst design. Strategies including atomic site dispersion, co&#8208;catalyst integration, defect engineering, and utilization of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) are discussed to promote C&#8211;C coupling, offering insights into selective solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion.








Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction represents a sustainable pathway for mitigating carbon emissions and producing renewable chemicals by utilizing solar energy. While extensive research has been dedicated to single&#8208;carbon (C1) products, the selective formation of multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) compounds, such as ethylene, ethane, ethanol and acetic acid, has garnered increasing attention due to their higher energy density and broader industrial relevance. However, achieving efficient C&#9472;C coupling under mild photocatalytic conditions remains a formidable challenge, hindered by complex reaction pathways, sluggish kinetics and competitive side reactions. In this review, recent advances in photocatalytic CO2 reduction to C2+ products was systematically summarized, focusing on fundamental reaction mechanisms, rational photocatalyst design strategies, including atomically dispersed active sites, cocatalyst loading, defect engineering, and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). By bridging mechanistic understanding with materials innovation, this review provides a comprehensive framework for guiding the development of next&#8208;generation photocatalytic systems for efficient and selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion, contributing to sustainable carbon utilization and circular chemical economy.

This study presents the synthesis, physical characterization, and transport as well as electrochemical properties of a novel class of ten ionic liquids (ILs). The ILs are created with two biomass derived anions such as furan&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate [FuA] and tetrahydrofuran&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate [HFuA] coupled to a range of nitrogen heterocyclic cations, for which the nature of cation controlled their transport and electrochemical properties. 








Abstract
Here we present the synthesis, physical characterization, and transport as well as electrochemical properties of a novel class of ten ionic liquids (ILs) derived from biomass. Two biomass derived anions such as furan&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate [FuA] and tetrahydrofuran&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate [HFuA] are coupled to a range of nitrogen heterocyclic cations to create the ILs, for which the nature of cation controlled their properties. For instance, the thermal decomposition temperature ranges from 183 to 259&#160;&#176;C, the glass transition temperature from&#160;&#8722;&#160;47 to&#160;&#8722;&#160;70&#160;&#176;C, and the ionic conductivity from 0.002 to 1.4 mS cm&#8722;1 at 20&#160;&#176;C. The supercapacitors prepared using [EPy][FuA] and [EMPip][FuA] exhibited specific capacitances of 99 F g&#8722;1 and 70 F g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1, respectively. The [EPy][FuA]&#8208;based supercapacitor achieved an energy density of 56&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 as well as a power density of 410&#160;W kg&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1, while the [EMPip][FuA]&#8208;based supercapacitor achieved an energy density of 36&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and a power density of 360&#160;W kg&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1. In addition, the supercapacitors retained 98% and 94% of their initial capacitances after 6000 cycles, for [EPy][FuA] and [EMPip][FuA] electrolytes, respectively.

         <title>Graphene Quantum Dots Drive Spontaneous Metal Reduction to Form Stable and Electroactive Core&#8208;Shell Nanocolloids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a spontaneous synthesis of metal (Au, Pt, and Ag) enveloped by crystalline graphene&#8208;quantum dots (GQDs). Aromatic and functional sp2 and sp3 hybridized carbons, within the GQDs shell, play a crucial role upon the synthesis, electronic distribution at the interface, and conductive sites for improving the electrocatalytic response. Au nanohybrids demonstrated two&#8208;fold increase in current density with respect to conventional citrate&#8208;coated Au nanoparticles. This was attributed to conductive sp2&#8208;carbons at the shell and the gain of charge electron density at the surface of Au as demonstrated by DFT calculations.








Abstract
This work demonstrates a spontaneous synthesis of &#8764;8.0, &#8764;7.0, and &#8764;3.0&#160;nm diameter Au, Ag, and Pt cores; respectively, wrapped by as&#8208;synthesized crystalline graphene&#8208;quantum dots (GQDs). Functional sp2&#8208; and sp3&#8208;hybridized carbons play a crucial role upon the synthesis, electronic distribution at the interface, and conductive sites for improving the electrocatalytic response. Au nanohybrids (NHs) demonstrated two&#8208;fold increase in current density with respect to conventional citrate&#8208;coated Au nanoparticles. This was attributed to conductive sp2&#8208; hybridized carbons and the gain of charge density at the surface of Au as demonstrated by DFT calculations. Due to the sp3&#8208;carbons at the shell, these NHs also behave like simple chemical compounds because they can be precipitated, stored for long periods of time, and redispersed without apparent changes in their properties. The resultant nanocolloids exhibit exceptional stability under harsh conditions. These attributes make them useful NHs with great potential for broad applications.

&lt;p&gt;This work demonstrates a spontaneous synthesis of metal (Au, Pt, and Ag) enveloped by crystalline graphene-quantum dots (GQDs). Aromatic and functional sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; hybridized carbons, within the GQDs shell, play a crucial role upon the synthesis, electronic distribution at the interface, and conductive sites for improving the electrocatalytic response.

This was attributed to conductive sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-carbons at the shell and the gain of charge electron density at the surface of Au as demonstrated by DFT calculations.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Conversion in Spin Crossover Metal&#8208;organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

The NIR&#8208;II photothermal conversion properties of SCO metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are investigated for the first time, offering novel insights into the development of intelligent multifunctional materials.








Abstract
The synthesis of multifunctional materials that exhibit two or more distinct physicochemical properties is critical for the development of advanced smart materials. To date, the research regarding the near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) photothermal properties of spin crossover (SCO) materials remains scarce. Here, we synthesized an inverse&#8208;Hofmann&#8208;type cationic framework, [Fe{Ag(CN)2}(TTF(py)4)]+ (1, TTF(py)4&#160;=&#160;tetra(4&#8208;pyridyl)tetrathiafulvalene), which exhibits hysteretic SCO behavior. By introducing p&#8208;aminoazobenzene (Azo&#8208;NH2) and pyrene (Pyr) into 1, two solvent&#8208;free derivatives, 1@Azo&#8208;NH2 and 1@Pyr, incorporating free radicals were generated. NIR&#8208;II photothermal experiments revealed the outstanding photothermal properties of 1@Azo&#8208;NH2 and 1@Pyr under 1064&#160;nm laser irradiation. Solar&#8208;driven water evaporation experiment demonstrated that 1@Pyr achieved a water evaporation rate of 0.9197&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 with an efficiency of 63.9%. This represents the first demonstration of outstanding NIR&#8208;II photothermal conversion performance in an inverse&#8208;Hofmann&#8208;type metal&#8208;organic framework incorporating free radicals generated through host&#8208;guest interactions. Our findings underscore the critical importance of incorporating NIR absorption units into SCO systems, providing new insights for the development of intelligent multifunctional materials.

The impact of purine, 7&#8208;deazapurine and 8&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deazapurine heterocyclic skeletons on the stability of the xanthine&#8208;2&#8208;aminoadenine base pair is reported. In view of stability and pH dependence, the 7&#8208;deazaxanthine &#8211; 2&#8208;amino&#8208;8&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine pair is superior to other combinations. Stable duplex formation is observed with tracts of xanthine residues opposite guanine or adenine, whereas duplex formation is hindered with cytosine and thymine.








Abstract
The impact of purine, 7&#8208;deazapurine and 8&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deazapurine heterocyclic skeletons on the stability of the xanthine&#8208;2&#8208;aminoadenine base pair is reported. Beyond that, base&#8208;pairing of xanthine nucleosides opposite canonical nucleobases is studied. To this end, a building block of 8&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deaza&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyxanthosine was prepared using 8&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deaza&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyguanosine as starting material. A simplified synthesis for large&#8208;scale production is presented for the phosphoramidite of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;7&#8208;bromo&#8208;7&#8208;deaza&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine (2&#8208;NH2Br7c7z8Ad). Hybridization of oligonucleotides gave duplexes containing single or multiple incorporations of xanthine&#8208;2&#8208;aminoadenine base pairs with different combinations of nucleobases. From melting curves and Tm values, it became apparent that the most stable duplexes contained base pairs of 2&#8208;NH2Br7c7z8Ad with xanthine nucleosides. Under these, the 7&#8208;deazaxanthine&#8208;2&#8208;NH2Br7c7z8Ad base pair reached the stability of dT&#8208;2&#8208;NH2Br7c7z8Ad and dG&#8208;dC pairs. 7&#8208;Deazaxanthine located opposite 2&#8208;aminoadenine residues resulted in higher duplex stability compared to xanthine or 8&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deazaxanthine. For 2&#8208;aminoadenine residues, the base pair stability followed the order 2&#8208;amino&#8208;8&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;bromo&#8208;7&#8208;deazaadenine&#160;&gt;&#160;2&#8208;aminoadenine&#160;&gt;&#160;7&#8208;deazaadenine. The impact of pK values became obvious from the increased stability of xanthine&#8208;2&#8208;aminoadenine pairs by decreasing the pH. Single incorporations of xanthine residues opposite canonical nucleobases displayed inhomogeneous pairing properties. Tracts of three xanthine residues in front of adenine and guanine furnished stable duplexes, whereas with cytosine and thymine, duplex formation was hindered.

         <title>Synthesis of Anthraquinone Mono&#8208; and Diboron Complexes with Near&#8208;Infrared Panchromatic Absorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anthraquinone boron complexes bearing &#946;&#8208;iminoenolate ligand(s) exhibit strongly substituent&#8208;dependent absorption properties. Unsubstituted monoboron and diboron complexes show sharp UV&#8211;Vis&#8211;NIR absorption spectra resulting from increased molecular rigidity induced by boron coordination. In contrast, dimethylamino&#8208;substituted complexes display near&#8208;infrared (NIR) panchromatic absorption, attributed to enhanced intramolecular charge transfer and multiple electronic transitions.








Abstract
Anthraquinone monoboron complexes 3 and 4, possessing a donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) structure, and diboron complexes 7 and 8, featuring a donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) structure, were readily synthesized in two steps from commercially available reagents. These boron complexes adopt a &#946;&#8208;iminoenolate structure and their absorption properties are markedly affected by the type of the substituent groups. The unsubstituted monoboron complex 3 (fwhm&#160;=&#160;3,950 cm&#8722;1) and diboron complex 7 (fwhm&#160;=&#160;2,510 cm&#8722;1) exhibited sharp UV&#8211;Vis&#8211;NIR absorption spectra, which can be attributed to increased molecular rigidity induced by boron coordination. In contrast, the dimethylamino&#8208;substituted monoboron complex 4 (fwhm&#160;=&#160;7,580 cm&#8722;1) and diboron complex 8 (fwhm&#160;=&#160;8,770 cm&#8722;1) showed broad absorption bands due to the enhanced intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) character. Dimethylamino&#8208;substituted monoboron complex 4 and diboron complex 8 exhibited panchromatic absorption ranging from 400&#160;nm to 1,000&#160;nm and 400&#160;nm to 1,250&#160;nm, respectively. The panchromatic absorption of the dimethylamino&#8208;substituted boron complexes 4 and 8 is attributed not only to the enhanced ICT character but also to the combination of multiple transitions.

         <dc:description>
Showcasing sono&#8208; and mechanochemistry: A sonochemistry&#8208; and mechanochemistry&#8208;assisted dual&#8208;synthetic approach for biologically and synthetically promising cyanomethyl carboxylates as a rapid, high&#8208;yielding, and robust alternative synthetic protocol under metal catalyst&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free conditions.








Abstract
We herein disclose a dual synthetic approach involving sonochemical and mechanochemical strategies for a diverse series of cyanomethyl esters of carboxylic acids. Both synthetic protocols offer a straightforward, efficient, and practical alternative to preparing this important class of biologically and synthetically promising organic compounds. Significant advantages of the newly developed methods include mild reaction conditions, avoidance of any metal catalysts and external oxidants, shorter reaction times (in minutes), good to excellent yields, broad substrate scope and tolerance of other various functional groups, gram&#8208;scale applicability, and reusability of the solid surface.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Induced Stabilization and Folding Pathways of &#945;&#8208;Helical Peptides: A Computational Investigation Using Steered Molecular Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study employed molecular simulations to investigate the stabilization of &#945;&#8208;helical structures in HFIP compared to aqueous environments. SMD simulations demonstrated the stretching polypeptide chains to effectively preserve &#945;&#8208;helical conformations and enhance structural stability through solvation effects.








Abstract
Fluorinated polar solvents, such as hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP), are known to denature proteins into &#945;&#8208;helix&#8208;rich structures, a phenomenon of interest in protein engineering and fiber science. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations offer a valuable approach to explore protein folding mechanisms. In the present study, steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations were conducted to stretch the polypeptide models along the &#945;&#8208;helix axis in different solvents. The potential of mean force (PMF) associated with nonequilibrium stretching of the polypeptide chain was higher in HFIP than in water and varied depending on amino acid composition and degree of polymerization. HFIP molecules preferentially concentrated in grooves of &#945;&#8208;helical polypeptides. Stretching the polypeptides in HFIP resulted in the formation of 310&#8208;helix structures, suggesting that local solvation enhances structural stability. Additional SMD simulations of Trp&#8208;cage, a mini&#8208;protein driven by hydrophobic collapse in protein folding, showed partial unfolding of the &#945;&#8208;helix region and global extension of both termini. The resulting PMF profiles indicate that &#945;&#8208;helices are formed in the early stages of Trp&#8208;cage folding. This study offers an analytical framework that can be extended to more complex amino acid sequences and proteins with diverse structural motifs. HFIP appears to play a central role in the &#945;&#8208;helical transformation of higher&#8208;order protein structures.

         <title>Phytic Acid Assisted Preparation of Cu3P/Cu@C Composites as High Performance Anodes for Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyaniline was polymerized and deposited on the surface of Cu nanowire@carbon (C) nanocore&#8208;shells, and utilizing phytic acid as phosphorus source, a unique Cu3P/Cu@C composite spherical structure with with N,P&#8208;codoped graphitic carbon nanotubes entwined has been fabricated through a simple high&#8208;temperature annealing. Such porous and doped Cu3P&#8208;carbon anodes show excellent rate capability with ultra&#8208;long service life at current density up to 2000 mA/g.








Abstract
Phosphorus&#8208;based anodes show new perspectives in high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries, but harsh synthesis and severe capacity attenuation seriously preclude their practical application. Here, Cu nanowire@carbon (C) nanocore&#8208;shells are designed to utilize as sacrificial templates for polyaniline loading, and with the assistance of phytic acid (PA), a novel Cu3P/Cu@C microsphere composite structure is successfully constructed via direct thermal annealing, in which heteroatom&#8208;doped graphitic carbon nanotubes are wounded with each other and firmly entangled on spheres. The polyaniline polymerization by (NH4)2S2O8 and the addition of PA are indispensable for the unique Cu3P sphere formation. Both the spherical Cu3P structure and its doped carbon encapsulating could largely alleviate volume expansion during lithium storage, while the intertwined carbon nanotubes provide fast transport channels for Li+. Therefore, as anode, it exhibits relatively stable cyclic performance, and after 10,000 cycles at an ultra&#8208;high rate of 2000 mA/g, it still maintain a capacity of 278.57 mAh/g with capacity retention of 73.12%. Through analysis, large specific surface area and multi&#8208;level pore distribution of the optimized Cu3P&#8208;carbon anode, and the extended interlayer spacing of doped carbon are conducive to the reversible intercalation and adsorption of Li+. Electrochemical mechanism analysis also confirms its dramatic surface pseudo&#8208;capacitance contribution and excellent reaction kinetics.

         <title>A 19F&#8208;ATCUN Peptide NMR Probe for Selective Cu2+ or Ni2+ Sensing in Complex Biological Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the design and synthesis of ratiometric 19F&#8208;ATCUN (Xxx&#8208;Zzz&#8208;His) peptide probes for the selective and reversible detection of Ni2&#8314; and Cu2&#8314; by 19F NMR spectroscopy. In contrast to fluorescence&#8208;based approaches, 19F NMR enables background&#8208;free detection in biological media, due to the absence of fluorine in native biomolecules. The probes remain stable and functional in complex cell media (DMEM), enabling the detection of Cu2&#8314; and Ni2&#8314; by 19F NMR with a limit of detection (LOD) of 4&#160;&#181;M and quantification (LOQ) of 10&#160;&#181;M, relevant for studying copper&#8208;related pathologies.

         <title>Mechanochemical Preferential Bromination at the &#945;&#8208;Position of Activated Naphthalenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study focuses on the mechanochemical pathway for &#945;&#8208;bromination of &#946;&#8208;functionalized naphthalenes. This uses N&#8208;bromosuccinimide as a mild brominating precursor and highlights the tolerance and limitations of functional groups used. This applies on gram scale synthesis and production of various useful intermediates.








Abstract
This study is the exploration of a solvent&#8208;free, mechanochemically enabled sustainable pathway for rapid and preferential selective &#945;&#8208;bromination of &#946;&#8208;functionalized naphthalenes using N&#8208;bromosuccinimide. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis and diverse post&#8208;functionalizations demonstrate the versatility of the &#945;&#8208;brominated &#946;&#8208;functionalized naphthalenes in organic synthesis, pharmaceuticals, materials, and catalysis. This green and environment&#8208;benign approach, having E&#8208;factor of 0.5, offers high yields up to 98% within 30 minutes and highlights broad functional electron&#8208;donating groups (EDGs) along with limitations of electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (EWGs).

&lt;p&gt;This study is the exploration of a solvent-free, mechanochemically enabled sustainable pathway for rapid and preferential selective &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-bromination of &#946;-functionalized naphthalenes using &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-bromosuccinimide. Gram-scale synthesis and diverse post-functionalizations demonstrate the versatility of the &#945;-brominated &#946;-functionalized naphthalenes in organic synthesis, pharmaceuticals, materials, and catalysis. This green and environment-benign approach, having E-factor of 0.5, offers high yields up to 98% within 30 minutes and highlights broad functional electron-donating groups (EDGs) along with limitations of electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoswitchable Merocyanine&#8208;Amphiphiles with Programmable Self&#8208;Assembly Times</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A merocyanine&#8208;based amphiphile self&#8208;assembles in water to form visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive ellipsoids that can be disassembled with visible light and reform abruptly &#8764;70&#160;minutes after the light is switched off. The kinetics of the light&#8208;induced assembly/disassembly process is controllable by incorporating different co&#8208;surfactants.








Abstract
A merocyanine&#8208;based amphiphile was self&#8208;assembled into ellipsoids that can be disassembled by irradiation with visible light and reassemble in the dark after a delay of &#8764;70&#160;minutes. Above a threshold concentration, the reassembly occurs when the ratio of protonated merocyanine to spiropyran reaches 7:3, suggesting both isomers are involved in the assembly. The thermal isomerization of the amphiphile when assembled (half&#8208;life &#8764;13&#160;minutes) is significantly slower than that in dilute solution (half&#8208;life &#8764;3.6&#160;minutes). The self&#8208;assembly behavior was confirmed by UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), small&#8208;angle neutron scattering (SANS) and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS). The delay between the isomerization and the assembly processes can be tuned between minutes and hours by adding differently charged co&#8208;surfactants.

         <title>Cyanostilbenes as Selective Chloride Carriers Relying on CH&#8208;anion Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This manuscript presents a series of eight small compounds based on the &#945;&#8208;cyanostilbene motif and with different substituents. Three of these compounds show good rates of chloride transport, as well as selectivity for chloride over hydroxide, bicarbonate, and fluoride anions.








Abstract
Achieving selectivity is one of the challenges in developing anion receptors for transmembrane transport. This can be achieved through larger molecular designs that encapsulate the anion efficiently or by using alternative binding motifs instead of the most commonly used NH&#8208;based hydrogen bond donors. In this study, we present a series of small chloride receptors based on &#945;&#8208;cyanostilbenes that use CH&#8208;based hydrogen bonds. By varying the substituents, we discovered that the compound containing four trifluoromethyl groups and a nitro group in addition to the two cyano groups exhibited the greatest affinity for chloride and the fastest chloride transport rates, surpassing the performance of reported triazole&#8208;based compound. Furthermore, this compound showed clear selectivity for transporting chloride over hydroxide, bicarbonate, and fluoride anions. The activity, selectivity, and deliverability of this compound make it a promising candidate for the treatment of chloride channelopathies.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aryl substituents navigate the course of Scholl&#8208;type oxidative coupling in tetraarylthiophenes, enabling selective mono&#8208; versus dual cyclizations via electronic step discrimination and control. Guided by Hammett &#963;p constants, this study deciphers reactivity trends, face selectivity, excellent control, and coupling pathways&#8212;offering a predictive blueprint for regioselective &#960;&#8208;architecture construction.








Abstract
Scholl&#8208;type oxidative aryl&#8208;aryl coupling is a powerful strategy for constructing extended &#960;&#8208;systems, yet achieving regioselectivity and stepwise control remains a formidable challenge. Here, we report a systematic study on tetraarylthiophene (TAT) frameworks, revealing how subtle electronic effects of aryl substituents govern C&#9472;C bond formation efficiency, selectivity, and pathways. Guided by electrochemical potentials and Hammett &#963;p constants, we establish a reactivity trend&#8212;OMe&#160;&gt;&#160;Me&#160;&gt;&#160;tBu&#160;&gt;&#160;H&#160;&gt;&#160;Ph&#160;&gt;&#160;F&#160;&gt;&#160;Cl&#160;&gt;&#160;CHO&#160;&gt;&#160;CF3&#8212;revealing that electron&#8208;rich aryls promote efficient coupling, while electron&#8208;deficient groups suppress reactivity. Crucially, face&#8208;selective mono&#8208;cyclization products (PTs) are achieved by electronic step discrimination, where strategically pairing electronically distinct aryls steers homo&#8208; versus cross&#8208;coupling outcomes, enabling precise control over sequential couplings. Our findings unveil a simple yet powerful electronic map to predict coupling outcomes, product evolution, and opens a rational path to design regioselective oxidative cyclizations in polyaryl architectures toward precise &#960;&#8208;frameworks.

Indeno[2.1&#8208;b]fluorenes and fluoreno[2,3&#8208;b]fluorenes having (trialkylsilyl)ethynyl groups dimerize spontaneously to yield the cyclodimers in the yields ranging from virtually zero to quantitative depending on the alkyl group. The regioselectivity of the bond formation (Head versus Tail) is also dependent on the alkyl group. These remarkable effects are attributed to the attractive London dispersion force between the &#960;&#8208; system and the alkyl groups.








Abstract
We present herein a systematic study on the cyclodimerization of (trialkylsilyl)ethynyl&#8208;substituted derivatives of indeno[2.1&#8208;b]fluorene and fluoreno[2,3&#8208;b]fluorene, which incorporate an open&#8208;shell meta&#8208;quinodimethane (m&#8208;QDM) unit. Our investigation focuses on the influence of different alkyl groups (methyl, isopropyl, or cyclohexyl) attached to the silyl moiety. Upon generation from the precursor diols via treatment with SnCl2, these m&#8208;QDM derivatives yielded cyclodimers with an anti&#8208;configuration. The reaction yields varied significantly, ranging from virtually zero to quantitative, depending on the steric bulk of the alkyl group. Furthermore, the regioselectivity of bond formation (Head versus Tail) with respect to the ethynyl&#8211;allenyl radical resonance forms was also notably affected by the choice of alkyl group. These remarkable observations are attributed to attractive London dispersion forces operating between the &#960;&#8208;system and the alkyl groups. Crucially, the degree of size matching between these components dictates both the dimerization efficiency and the regioselectivity of the bond&#8208;forming process.

         <title>Coacervate Vesicles as Adaptive Platforms for Synthetic Biology and Smart Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coacervate vesicles are emerging protocells that merge coacervates&#8217; functionality within membranised architectures. Their diverse formation mechanisms from coacervate droplets yield tunable, responsive systems with broad potential, from synthetic biology to smart materials, offering a powerful, programmable platform for next&#8208;generation bioinspired technologies.








Abstract
Coacervate vesicles represent a versatile and emerging class of protocells that combine the dynamic properties of coacervate microdroplets with the structural advantages of membrane&#8208;bound systems. Leveraging features such as selective molecular uptake, enhanced reactivity, and dynamicity, they offer a promising platform for both fundamental research and technological applications in synthetic biology.

&lt;p&gt;Coacervate vesicles are emerging protocells that merge coacervates&#8217; functionality within membranised architectures. Their diverse formation mechanisms from coacervate droplets yield tunable, responsive systems with broad potential, from synthetic biology to smart materials, offering a powerful, programmable platform for next-generation bioinspired technologies.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coacervate vesicles represent a versatile and emerging class of protocells that combine the dynamic properties of coacervate microdroplets with the structural advantages of membrane-bound systems. Leveraging features such as selective molecular uptake, enhanced reactivity, and dynamicity, they offer a promising platform for both fundamental research and technological applications in synthetic biology. In this concept, we introduce a classification of coacervate vesicles based on their formation mechanisms and energetic landscapes, highlighting how their formation routes give rise to protocells with distinct structural and dynamic properties. Furthermore, we explore how these features translate into potential applications, including artificial life-like systems, complex communication networks, adaptive soft materials, and smart drug-delivery platforms. While the field is still in its infancy, the simplicity, versatility, and programmability of coacervate vesicles position them as a powerful framework for engineering next-generation synthetic life-like systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis, Structure, and Reactivity of a 1&#8208;Stannavinylidene&#8208;NHC Complex: A Heavier Group&#8208;14 Analogue of Vinylidene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper describes the synthesis, structural characterization, and reactivity of the first stable 1&#8208;stannavinylidene&#8208;NHC complex, that is, a neutral monomeric compound with a C&#160;=&#160;Sn &#960;&#8208;bond, which is a heavier group&#8208;14 analogue of vinylidene. The vinylidene&#8208;type character of the molecule was confirmed by spectroscopic means, X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, theoretical calculations, and a reactivity study.








Abstract
The first stable 1&#8208;stannavinylidene&#8208;NHC complex with bulky silyl substituents has been obtained from the retro&#8208;dimerization of cyclic 1,3&#8208;bis(stannylene) with an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC). To accomplish the retro&#8208;dimerization of cyclic 1,3&#8208;bis(stannylene), a suitably sized NHC is required. Both in the solid state and in solution, 1&#8208;stannavinylidene&#8208;NHC complex is characterized by the presence of a C&#160;=&#160;Sn &#960; bond. When treated with SnCl2, 1&#8208;stannavinylidene&#8208;NHC complex undergoes an addition reaction to afford the corresponding stable gem&#8208;bis(chlorostannylene).

         <title>Aromatic Wall Extension of Glycoluril&#8208;Derived Molecular Clips Enhances Binding of Planar Aromatic Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of the length of the aromatic walls of methylene&#8208;bridged glycoluril&#8208;dimer&#8208;derived molecular clips on their binding affinity toward a panel of planar aromatic cations is reported. We find that anthracene&#8208;walled host H2 generally binds&#160;&#8776;&#160;10&#8208;fold stronger to a specific guest than naphthalene&#8208;walled H1.








Abstract
We report the synthesis and characterization of a new methylene&#8208;bridged glycoluril dimer featuring anthracene walls (H2). H2 displays good solubility in water (&#8805;7&#160;mM) but undergoes self&#8208;association at concentrations above 2&#160;mM. 1H NMR experiments establish that H2 binds cationic dyes inside its cavity with a &#960;&#8208;stacked geometry that places the cationic residues at the ureidyl carbonyl portals of H2. The binding constants of both naphthalene&#8208;walled clip H1 and anthracene&#8208;walled clip H2 toward a panel of dyes were measured by direct or competitive UV/Vis or fluorescence titrations in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Binding constants cover the range from 103 &#8211; 108 M&#8722;1. Dyes that feature cationic NMe2 groups bind more strongly than analogous dyes with cationic NH2 groups. We find that &#960;&#8208;extension of the aromatic walls from H1 to H2 generally results in an&#160;&#8776;&#160;10&#8208;fold increase in binding affinity. Host&#8226;guest complexes of H1 and H2 with planar cationic dyes benefit from substantial cation&#8208;&#960; interactions.

         <title>3&#8242;&#8208;C&#8208;Extended TNA: De Novo Synthesis, Enhanced Exonuclease Resistance, and Functional siRNA 3&#8242;&#8208;Overhang Modifications Without Compromising Gene Silencing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed and synthesized 3&#8242;&#8208;C&#8208;extended TNA analogs (ApioNA and BpioNA) through asymmetric aldol synthesis. These analogs, modified at the 3&#8242;&#8208;terminal of oligonucleotides, display significant exonuclease resistance, particularly BpioNA, which has a 60&#8208;fold increase in half&#8208;life compared to dT. Furthermore, both analogs maintain full gene&#8208;silencing efficacy when integrated into the 3&#8242;&#8208;overhang positions of siRNA, highlighting their potential in nucleic acid therapeutics.








Abstract
The 3&#8242;&#8208;overhang of siRNAs is crucial for RISC assembly and stability, yet it is susceptible to nuclease degradation, significantly limiting its therapeutic applications. To address this challenge, we developed 3&#8242;&#8208;C&#8208;extended threose nucleic acid (TNA) analogs (ApioNA and BpioNA) using an asymmetric aldol synthesis strategy. Our results demonstrate that the BpioNA modification provides exceptional nuclease resistance, exhibiting a 60&#8208;fold increase in half&#8208;life compared to dT, while maintaining full gene silencing activity. Structural modeling revealed that these novel analogs preserve critical interactions with the Ago2 PAZ domain through adaptive binding geometries. This work not only addresses the stability&#8208;activity trade&#8208;off in siRNA design but also provides fundamental insights into the structure&#8208;activity relationships (SARs) at the 3&#8242;&#8208;terminus, paving the way for the development of durable RNAi therapeutics.

         <title>In Situ Electrochemical Synthesis of Redox&#8208;Active o&#8208;Hydroquinone Metabolite of Flufenamic Acid on MWCNT Surface: Lifespan Extension in C. elegans via SOD Pathway</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an electrochemical strategy to generate the redox&#8208;active flufenamic acid&#8208;drug metabolite, FFA&#8208;Redox, which extends the lifespan of C. elegans worm&#8208;by up to 80% under pathogenic infection. The metabolite reduces intracellular ROS levels and enhances superoxide dismutase expression, suggesting a potent antioxidant&#8208;driven &#8220;de&#8208;aging&#8221; mechanism with promising biomedical potential.








Abstract
The search for drugs that extend lifespan in human&#8208;like biological models is a frontier area in biomedical research. In this study, we report a novel electrochemical approach using flufenamic acid (FFA), a widely known nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug (NSAID), to generate and detect its pharmacologically active metabolites. Electrochemical oxidation of FFA on multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes(MWCNT)&#8208;modified electrode yielded hydroxylated derivatives, primarily 4&#8208;hydroxy FFA (m/z 297.05&#160;g/mol) and a polyhydroxylated product termed FFA&#8208;Redox (m/z 243.05&#160;g/mol), as surface&#8208;confined species (MWCNT@FFA&#8208;Redox). To establish biological relevance, Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) were exposed to FFA, resulting in in vivo formation of metabolites identical to those generated electrochemically. This confirmed the physiological significance of the electrosynthesized compounds. Lifespan assays demonstrated that FFA&#8208;Redox prolonged the survival of C. elegans by up to 40% under Klebsiella pneumoniae infection and by up to 80% under Staphylococcus aureus infection. This protective effect was attributed to reduced levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mechanistic insights suggest that FFA&#8208;Redox induces a &#8220;de&#8208;aging&#8221; response by enhancing the expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD), a key antioxidant enzyme activated during oxidative stress.

         <title>5d Orbital Covalency Controls the High&#8208;Pressure Polymorphism of BaO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Barium oxide forms unique structures under pressure because of Ba&#8212;O bonding through the 5d orbitals. DFT bonding analysis shows that these bonds outweigh electrostatic interactions in BaO, but not CaO or SrO.








Abstract
The influence of metal d orbitals on the high&#8208;pressure structures of CaO, SrO, and BaO are investigated with DFT calculations and chemical bonding analysis. CaO and SrO undergo the B1&#8208;B2 transition, from the rock salt structure to the caesium chloride structure, while BaO undergoes a sequence of transitions from B1&#8208;B8, the NiAs structure, and then B8 &#8722; dB2, a distorted form of B2. DFT calculations of bond strengths show that the B8 and dB2 structures are stabilized relative to B1 and B2 by metal&#8211;oxygen covalency through the metal d orbitals. In BaO covalency outweighs electrostatics because of the large 5d orbitals of Ba, so the unique B8 and dB2 structures form. This marks an important expansion of the importance of d orbitals in group II&#160;chemistry.

         <title>Halogen Bond&#8208;Tuning of Responsive Supramolecular Amino Acid Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
XB strongly influences both solid&#8208;state packing and rheological properties of hydrogels of a tailored halogenated Fmoc&#8208;amino acid in biomimetic environments. Interestingly, the addition of effective XB&#8208;acceptors (Nu) to the gelation medium increased gel stiffness, preluding to the possible future development of XB&#8208;responsive amino acid hydrogels in anion sensing, or for the encapsulation of specific guest molecules.








Abstract
N&#8208;Fmoc&#8208;pentafluoro&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine (F5) forms stable supramolecular hydrogels, mainly through &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking of its aromatic groups. Hydrogen bonding&#8208;driven co&#8208;assembly of F5 with suitable partner molecules has been reported to affect the gel's properties, in accordance with what is observed in their corresponding co&#8208;crystal structures. Herein, we extended this hydrogel modulation strategy to halogen bonding (XB) interactions by introducing an XB&#8208;donating iodine atom in the para&#8208;position of the F5 phenyl ring. Under conditions mimicking biological environments, both crystal packing and hydrogelation of the resulting N&#8208;Fmoc&#8208;4&#8208;iodo&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;phenylalanine (IF4), were significantly affected by iodine&#8208;&#960; interactions. Slower fibril formation kinetics and reduced strength of IF4 hydrogels in phosphate buffer solution, compared to F5, mirrored iodine&#8208;induced changes in Fmoc stacking in the solid state. Notably, the addition of strong XB&#8208;acceptors &#8211; such as iodide anions or pyridine&#8208;containing substrates, like vitamin B3 &#8211; induced a significant increase in gel stiffness. These findings suggest the possibility of exploiting properly tailored Fmoc&#8208;amino acids as &#8220;XB&#8208;responsive&#8221; hydrogelators, useful for anion sensing applications or for trapping bioactive molecules.

         <title>Mild and Selective Trifluoromethylation of Peptides at Tryptophane Residues by a Water&#8208;Soluble Copper Complex with Redox&#8208;Active Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective functionalization of aminoacids is a key endeavor in chemical biology. Radical manifolds offer interesting possibilities but can suffer from limited control over radical processes, resulting in a lack of selectivity in product distribution. A water&#8208;soluble copper complex with redox&#8208;active ligands has been developed and performs trifluoromethylation of tryptophane residues with high selectivity. This method displays both inter&#8208; and intramolecular selectivity and its synthetic relevance is demonstrated by the selective conversion of a 13&#8208;residue peptidic sequence and an endomorphine analogue in good yields.








Abstract
Selective chemical modifications of biomolecules are in high demand for the development and implementation of chemical biology strategies. Methods involving radicals have emerged as powerful options yet potentially generate side reactivities when involving harsh reaction conditions. We report the development of a mild catalytic method for the selective functionalization of tryptophane residues in peptides with a trifluoromethyl group using a water&#8208;soluble copper complex with redox&#8208;active ligands. This method displays both inter&#8208; and intramolecular selectivity for tryptophane residues and its synthetic relevance is demonstrated by the selective conversion of a 13&#8208;residue peptidic sequence and an endomorphine analogue in good yields.

         <title>Copper&#8208;catalyzed Chemoselective Reduction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated Flavone Olefin and It's Glycosides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a chemoselective copper&#8208;catalyzed reduction of flavones to flavanones using ammonia borane as a hydrogen source. Copper (II) catalyst in combination with a bipyridine ligand enabled selective hydrogenation of the C&#9552;C bond in the enone system, whereas Cu(I) without a ligand facilitated dual reduction of both the olefinic and carbonyl groups, yielding flavanols under similar conditions. NMR studies revealed that the reaction proceeds through the in situ generation of CuH in the reaction medium as the active reducing agent.








Abstract
The chemoselective reduction of flavones to flavanones remains a significant synthetic challenge in the total synthesis of bioactive flavonoid glycosides. This chemoselective reduction of flavone olefin requires precise control over reactivity to reduce the conjugated &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl system without affecting the functional groups commonly present in the complex carbohydrate derivatives. We report a straightforward copper&#8208;catalyzed reduction method using ammonia borane (NH3&#8226;BH3) as a hydrogen source. The catalytic system, based on a Cu(II) combination with bipyridine ligand, exhibited highly chemoselective hydrogenation of the C&#9552;C bond in the enone moiety of flavones to flavanones, whereas the Cu(I) without ligand reduced both functional groups to furnish flavanols. Notably, this methodology demonstrated a broad substrate scope with a wide range of functional group tolerance, including various sugar&#8208;derived substituents. The synthetic utility and versatility of the protocol were further highlighted through the useful synthesis of a library of mono&#8208; and disaccharide&#8208;conjugated flavonoid glycosides. Interestingly, this catalytic system displayed distinct reactivity by efficiently reducing carbonyl compounds to alcohols while inhibiting over&#8208;reduction to alkanes. Additionally, we performed a series of control experiments to gain a deeper insight into the mechanism and revealed that the reaction proceeds through the in situ generation of CuH in the reaction.

         <title>Soluble Ring&#8208;Unsubstituted Phthalocyanine Zirconium(IV) and Niobium(V) cis&#8208;Alkoxides and Their Catalytic Activity Toward the Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of rac&#8208;Lactide</title>

         <dc:description>
Ring&#8208;unsubstituted phthalocyanine chloride complexes of Zr(IV) and Nb(V) are solubilized via conversion to a range of cis&#8208;axially ligated alkoxides, which show varying levels of activity as lactide polymerization catalysts depending on the alkoxide and the metal center.








Abstract
A series of soluble ring&#8208;unsubstituted early&#8208;transition metallophthalocyanine (PcM) alkoxides with zirconium(IV) and niobium(V) metal centers was prepared via salt metathesis with PcM chlorides and a range of lithium or sodium alkoxides (NaOMe, NaOEt, LiOiPr, and NaOtBu); several examples were structurally characterized. Given their large ionic size, the metal centers protrude out of the Pc cavity, engendering cis&#8208;axial ligation of the alkoxides and thereby generating substantially improved solubility relative to the starting PcM chlorides. Seven&#8208;coordinate PcM(OR)3&#8208;type coordination spheres were typically observed, with lithium&#8208; or sodium&#8208;balanced &#8220;ate&#8221; species PcZr(OiPr)3Li(THF) and PcZr(OtBu)3Na(THF) isolated for PcZr(IV), compared to the neutral PcNb(OiPr)3. With the highly steric R&#160;=&#160;tBu the neutral six&#8208;coordinate PcZr(OtBu)2 was also structurally characterized. The catalytic activity of the PcZr(IV) and PcNb(V) alkoxides was probed toward the ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of rac&#8208;lactide, with PcZr(OiPr)3Li(THF) being the most active, while the PcNb(V) systems were either inactive or yielded oligomers.

   &lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Pr, and NaO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Bu); several examples were structurally characterized. Given their large ionic size, the metal centers protrude out of the Pc cavity, engendering &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-axial ligation of the alkoxides and thereby generating substantially improved solubility relative to the starting PcM chlorides. Seven-coordinate PcM(OR)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-type coordination spheres were typically observed, with lithium- or sodium-balanced &#8220;&lt;i&gt;ate&lt;/i&gt;&#8221; species PcZr(O&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Pr)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Li(THF) and PcZr(O&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Bu)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Na(THF) isolated for PcZr(IV), compared to the neutral PcNb(O&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Pr)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. With the highly steric R&#160;=&#160;&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Bu the neutral six-coordinate PcZr(O&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Bu)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was also structurally characterized. The catalytic activity of the PcZr(IV) and PcNb(V) alkoxides was probed toward the ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of &lt;i&gt;rac&lt;/i&gt;-lactide, with PcZr(O&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Pr)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Li(THF) being the most active, while the PcNb(V) systems were either inactive or yielded oligomers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Ability of Enzymes to Preserve Reactive Conformations During Enzyme&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions can be an Important Factor for Efficient Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymes may not only generate catalytic competent conformations for enzyme&#8208;substrate complexes but also be able to preserve the reactive conformations to the stage when the reactions reach TS to allow catalytic residues to exert their effects. Such property could be lost for some mutants, leading to diminished TS stabilization and significant reduction of catalytic efficiency. Blue: enzyme; Yellow: substrate; Orange: the altered structure of substrate in TS.








Abstract
Determining strategies used by enzymes to achieve enormous rate enhancements has been a central goal in biochemical research. The abilities to form catalytic competent reactive conformations for enzyme&#8208;substrate complexes with well&#8208;positioned residues and to lower activation barriers through transition state (TS) stabilization are two accepted mechanisms. Enzymes might have evolved to possess other unrecognized strategies to achieve rate enhancements, and identification of such strategies is of fundamental importance. Here we perform a quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical study of carnosine N&#8208;methyltransferase 1 and its mutants, and results indicate that enzymes may possess the ability to preserve reactive conformations and prevent their premature distortions into less active forms during reactions. For wild&#8208;type, the reactive conformation can be formed in the enzyme&#8208;substrate complex and be preserved to the stage when the reaction reaches TS. For Tyr386Ala, Tyr396Asp, and Tyr398Ala, the wild&#8208;type&#8208;like reactive conformations can be formed in the mutant&#8208;substrate complexes but undergo distortions into less active conformations in the early stage of the reaction before TS. Such premature distortions of the wild&#8208;type&#8208;like reactive conformations in the mutant complexes prevent residues from fully exerting catalytic effects. Thus, the ability to preserve reactive conformations may be an important feature for some enzymes and can make important contributions to catalytic efficiency.

         <title>Rationalising Exciton Interactions in Aggregates Based on the Transition Density</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exciton coupling in organic chromophores is revisited through the lens of the transition density. The presented formalism gives insight into the strength and sign of the coupling based on the relative arrangement of the lobes of the transition density explaining oscillations between H&#8208; and J&#8208;aggregate behavior observed when two molecules are displaced relative to each other.








Abstract
Aggregation effects of molecular chromophores play a crucial role in determining the spectroscopic properties of solid&#8208;state organic materials. Within this work, we focus on excitonic coupling and particularly the question of whether aggregation leads to H&#8208; or J&#8208;type coupling, that is, whether the lowest energy excited state of the aggregate is optically bright or not. Employing a supermolecular picture to represent the different terms giving rise to exciton splitting, we develop an intuitive and generally applicable phenomenological model for estimating the sign and magnitude of the exciton coupling. This model, which is based on the shape of the monomer transition density is shown to be suitable across the whole range of relevant wave function types from purely Coulomb&#8208;coupled Frenkel excitons to strongly charge&#8208;transfer admixed excimer states. The implications are illustrated in the stacked anthracene and perylene&#8208;diimide dimer systems. The presented model does not only explain the long&#8208;range behavior but provides a clear explanation of atom&#8208;scale oscillations in the couplings seen for these systems. We hope that this work will give a boost to modern molecular materials science by providing new insight into interactions in the solid state as well as by highlighting the power of going beyond a simple frontier orbital picture in the design of molecular&#160;materials.

         <title>A Mechanistic Insight into the Emission Behavior of Boron Difluorohydrazones (BODIHYs): Suppression of Kasha's Rule</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anti&#8208;Kasha property of phenanthrene&#8208;based BODIHY compounds leads to excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent RGB emissions. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that both molecules emit from three different excited states, namely S1, S2, and S3. Importantly, the phenyl&#8208;substituted BODIHY exhibits thermal equilibrium between S1 and S2, while S3 does not.








Abstract
Single component&#8208;based molecules and materials exhibiting excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent emission are of significant interest in both academic and industrial contexts. Luminophores capable of emitting multiple colors in response to different excitation wavelengths often deviate from Kasha's rule. The boron difluorohydrazone (BODIHY) derivatives reported herein exhibit excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent emissions, illuminating red, green, and blue (RGB) colors. Experimental and theoretical studies indicate that this multi&#8208;color luminescence originates from three bright excited states, namely, S1, S2, and S3. Such anomalous fluorescence in small organic molecules that possess three bright excited states and emit RGB as a function of excitation wavelength is unique and unprecedented. Time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations indicate that the energy gap (&#916;E) between S2 and S3 exceeds 3000 cm&#8722;1 (0.37&#160;eV), facilitating radiative decay S3&#8594;S0 over the competitive nonradiative decay. For compound 1, the &#916;E(S1&#8211;S2) was found to be&#160;&lt;&#160;2000 cm&#8722;1 (0.25&#160;eV), leading to thermal equilibrium between the two states. In contrast, compound 2 possesses three distinct excited states that fluoresce independently due to large energy gaps between them. Furthermore, different excitation spectra, fluorescence lifetimes, and photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) for these emission bands indeed support the presence of three bright excited electronic states.

         <title>Quantum&#8208;Dots Light&#8208;Emitting Devices Based on Exciton Harvesting Layers</title>

         <dc:description>
This review introduces the concept and development of exciton harvesting layer (EHL) in quantum&#8208;dots light&#8208;emitting devices (QLEDs) as a targeted strategy to address carrier imbalance. We conclude its applicability from the QLEDs' working mechanisms, discuss the energy transfer mechanisms underlying EHL and its design principles, and highlights the significant performance improvements achieved in QLEDs.








Abstract
Quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) have emerged as a promising technology for display and lighting applications due to their high color purity, tunable emission wavelengths, and solution processability. However, carrier imbalance arising from differences in injection barriers and mobilities between electrons and holes remains a significant challenge, leading to charge accumulation or leakage and resulting in performance losses. To address these issues, exciton harvesting layers (EHLs) have recently gained attention as an effective and targeted strategy. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the EHL concept and its development in QLEDs. We begin by introducing the fundamental properties of quantum dots (QDs) and the working principles of QLEDs, followed by a discussion of the applicability of the EHL strategy. We then detail the mechanisms of energy transfer within EHL and between EHL and QDs, as well as its optimization approaches. Subsequently, we summarize the application of EHLs in QLEDs and the corresponding improvements in device performance. Finally, we highlight current challenges and future research directions of the EHL strategy.

         <title>Experimental Discovery and Electronic Structure of Free State Aminopentazole N5NH2 and its Cation</title>

N3&#8722;, N5+, cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722;, etc. are crucial all&#8208;nitrogen blocks for ANC. The free state N5NH2 and its cation N5NH3+ were synthesized via radical amination of cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722; and directional hydrolysis of imido&#8208;pentazoles N5N&#160;=&#160;CHN(Me)2.








Abstract
All&#8208;nitrogen compounds (ANC) that are environment&#8208;friendly and promising high&#8208;energy&#8208;density materials (HEDMs). N5NH2, an all&#8208;nitrogen building block with functional groups, can be converted into bridged&#8208;pentazole N10, azopentazole N12, etc. But N5NH2 synthesized by previous methods was bound in supramolecular frameworks and not isolated for further research. In this article, we synthesized free&#8208;state N5NH2 through radical amination of cyclo&#8208;N5&#8210; and its cation N5NH3+ by the directional hydrolysis of imido&#8208;pentazoles. The new structures were verified by MS, IR, NMR and powder diffraction, and their aromaticity, HOMO&#8208;LUMO, ESP, etc. were calculated by DFT. Experimental results show these compounds are only stable at low temperature. For instance, N5NH3+Cl&#8210; is stable below &#8210;20 &#176;C for 12&#160;hours. Harmonic oscillator model of aromaticity (HOMA), electron localization function (ELF), NICSZZ(1)&#960;, localized orbital locator (LOL), and anisotropy of the induced current density (ACID) show N5NH2 and N5NH3+ have aromaticity, and the order of aromaticity and stability is N5NH3+ &lt; N5NH2&#160;&lt;&#160;cyclo&#8208;N5&#8210;, consistent with experiments. The HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gaps of N5NH2 (&#916;E&#160;=&#160;10.05&#160;eV) and N5NH3+ (&#916;E&#160;=&#160;10.14&#160;eV) is lower than that of cyclo&#8208;N5&#8210; (&#916;E&#160;=&#160;11.46&#160;eV), indicating higher reaction activity. The synthesis of free&#8208;state N5NH2 is a crucial step in all&#8208;nitrogen construction and promotes the energetic materials field toward all&#8208;nitrogen.

         <title>Photoredox Mediated Synthesis of Substituted Imidazoles from Terminal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible light photoredox&#8208;induced approach for the synthesis of substituted imidazoles via alkynes, glycine methyl ester, and thiophenol is presented. The reaction is driven via photoinduced exploration of alkynes and their combination with thiol, producing vinylic radical and its subsequent nucleophilic addition to glycine methyl ester as N&#8208;source to produce imidazoles via concurrent two C&#9472;N bond formations.








Abstract
A visible light photoredox&#8208;induced approach for the synthesis of substituted imidazoles via alkynes, glycine methyl ester, and thiophenol is presented. The reaction is facilitated by the photoinduced activation of alkynes, coupled with thiol, which generates a vinylic radical. This radical subsequently undergoes a nucleophilic addition to glycine methyl ester, serving as a nitrogen source, thereby leading to the formation of imidazoles through the concurrent creation of two carbon&#8208;nitrogen bonds.

         <title>Friedel&#8208;Crafts Reaction with Polyolefins as Alkylation Reagents and Poly(vinyl chloride) as Initiator</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an upcycling strategy converting waste polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) into monoalkylbenzenes via AlCl3&#8208;mediated Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation. With poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) as a cost&#8208;effective initiator and polyolefins as alkylation reagents under mild conditions, this method achieves complete polyolefin conversion while selectively yielding toluene, ethylbenzene, cumene, and n&#8208;propylbenzene.








Abstract
Chemical upcycling of waste plastic has attracted substantial attention. While current upcycling methods are typically successful in converting single&#8208;component plastic waste, conversion of mixed plastics resembling real&#8208;world plastic waste with a single catalytic system remains a challenge. In this manuscript, we report an upcycling method suitable for a range of polyolefins (including mixtures of PP, LDPE, HDPE, and PVC, the four most produced plastics), which selectively produces toluene, ethylbenzene, cumene, and propylbenzene in the presence of benzene. The generation of ethylbenzene and cumene as major upcycling products, currently produced from ethylene or propylene and benzene, effectively circumvents the thermodynamically unfavorable depolymerization of polyolefins, allowing polyolefins to function as olefin surrogates in organic transformations. The utilization of inexpensive AlCl3 as a pre&#8208;catalyst, tolerance to additives, and mild reaction conditions render this method readily adapted by the current industry setup. Therefore, this upcycling method may have some significant impact on the mitigation of the waste plastic crisis.

         <title>What Makes a Branched Aromatic Compound a Crystallization Chaperone? Insights from a Comparison of Three Organic Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ability to accommodate guest molecules of many different shapes in crystal lattices has been tested for teraaryl derivatives of porphyrin, spirobifluorene, and adamantane. The latter appears to offer the most favorable properties, which may be at least partially due to low activation barriers for the interconversion of rotamers.








Abstract
Some tetraaryladamantane (TAA) octa&#8208; and tetraethers have the ability to crystallize into well&#8208;ordered lattices without full desolvation. In many cases, the solvates then yield high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray crystal structures of the encapsulated liquids. To shed light on this unusual effect of TAAs as crystallization chaperones, we have synthesized a series of spirobiflourene and porphyrin derivatives with four phenyl arms also found in TAA chaperones. Despite the structural similarity, neither of the non&#8208;TAA compounds showed promising crystallization properties. Six new X&#8208;ray crystal structures were obtained, but neither gave a high&#8208;resolution structure of an encapsulated guest. Quantum chemical computations suggest that conformational changes have low activation barriers for the TAAs, which may help to adapt to the structures of guest molecules in tightly packed arrangements. These findings on supramolecular chemistry in the crystalline state may help to design new chaperones with improved properties.

         <title>Microwave Radiation for Organolithium Chemistry: Mechanistic Studies on the Direct &#945;&#8208;Metalation of a Tertiary Amine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the use of microwave radiation to lithium chemistry, specifically in the kinetically hindered deprotonation of a tertiary amine at high temperatures without polar additives. The amine acts as substrate and deaggregation agent as shown by a solid&#8208;state structure. The lithium compounds remain stable at the harsh conditions and the deprotonated amine is storage&#8208;stable, facilitating diverse follow&#8208;up chemistry.








Abstract
Deprotonation reactions with lithium alkyls exhibit a high temperature dependency. However, the reactivity of lithium alkyls with conventionally used Lewis bases limits their deprotonation capability of more challenging substrates like tertiary amines. Therefore, we have focused on the use of high but exactly set reaction temperatures by usage of microwave radiation in the deprotonation reaction of a tertiary amine in the absence of polar additives. Our study proves the robustness of lithium alkyls, like t&#8208;butyllithium and &#945;&#8208;metalated tertiary amines under microwave conditions. A solid&#8208;state structure of the prelithiation aggregate and quantum chemical calculations offer an insight into the mechanism, revealing that the substrate amine performs as Lewis base for deaggregation itself. By our method, N&#8208;methylpiperidine was deprotonated without any intermediate or possibly toxic reaction steps, solvents, or additives, solely with t&#8208;butyllithium in the microwave with 56% yield. By using design of experiments we identified the most important factors for a successful deprotonation, revealing the closed reaction conditions under pressure and an excess of amine to be crucial. This investigation proves the high potential of microwave radiation in lithium chemistry, as it provides high but exact energy and introduces new possibilities for deprotonation reactions to overcome high kinetic reaction barriers.

The lithium compounds remain stable at the harsh conditions and the deprotonated amine is storage-stable, facilitating diverse follow-up chemistry.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deprotonation reactions with lithium alkyls exhibit a high temperature dependency. However, the reactivity of lithium alkyls with conventionally used Lewis bases limits their deprotonation capability of more challenging substrates like tertiary amines. Therefore, we have focused on the use of high but exactly set reaction temperatures by usage of microwave radiation in the deprotonation reaction of a tertiary amine in the absence of polar additives. Our study proves the robustness of lithium alkyls, like &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-butyllithium and &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-metalated tertiary amines under microwave conditions. A solid-state structure of the prelithiation aggregate and quantum chemical calculations offer an insight into the mechanism, revealing that the substrate amine performs as Lewis base for deaggregation itself. By our method, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methylpiperidine was deprotonated without any intermediate or possibly toxic reaction steps, solvents, or additives, solely with &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-butyllithium in the microwave with 56% yield. By using &lt;i&gt;design of experiments&lt;/i&gt; we identified the most important factors for a successful deprotonation, revealing the closed reaction conditions under pressure and an excess of amine to be crucial. This investigation proves the high potential of microwave radiation in lithium chemistry, as it provides high but exact energy and introduces new possibilities for deprotonation reactions to overcome high kinetic reaction barriers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biphasic Continuous Esterification of Choline Chloride&#8208;Based Deep Eutectic Solvents using ICHEM Technology: A Step toward New Hydrotropes with Potential Anticorrosive Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Impact in Continuous Flow Heated Mechanochemistry (ICHEM) technology was used for the first biphasic continuous flow esterification of choline chloride&#8208;based deep eutectic solvents (DESs) with nonmiscible acetic, hexanoic, and octanoic anhydrides, resulting in the synthesis of novel hydrotropic DESs. The reaction was first optimized in batch using acetic anhydride, and then scaled up to continuous flow in an 80&#160;mL WAB Research Lab ICHEM reactor, achieving 90&#8211;95% yields at lab scales of 50&#8211;100&#160;g. The physicochemical properties of the three new DESs were analyzed, revealing that esterification via the ICHEM process had minimal impact on these properties compared to the conventional batch method. Furthermore, the potential of these new hydrotropic DESs as anticorrosive agents was evaluated, demonstrating their effectiveness as corrosion inhibitors.

         <title>Naming Matters: Hydridic Hydrogen Atoms are Halogen, Chalcogen, and Pnictogen Bond Acceptors not &#8220;Hydridic Hydrogen Bond&#8221; Donors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydridic hydrogen atoms (e.g., in Me3Ge&#9472;H) form directional noncovalent interactions with electrophilic Br, Se, and As centers. Through electrostatic and orbital analyses, these interactions are identified as halogen, chalcogen, and PnBs, not as &#8220;hydridic hydrogen bonds.&#8221; The study promotes clarity in nomenclature consistent with IUPAC guidelines.








Abstract
The definition and classification of noncovalent interactions are essential for consistent communication in supramolecular chemistry. A recent paper introduced the term &#8220;hydridic hydrogen bond&#8221; to describe interactions where hydrogen atoms bound to electropositive elements (e.g., Si, Ge, Sn) act as electron donors. However, such terminology conflicts with IUPAC definition, which requires hydrogen to be bonded to more electronegative atoms for a hydrogen bond (HB). Herein, we combine electrostatic potential analysis, energy decomposition, ELF/QTAIM, and NBO calculations to show that interactions involving hydridic hydrogen atoms as donors and heavier main group elements (Br, Se, As) as acceptors are better classified as halogen, chalcogen, and pnictogen bonds (PnBs), respectively. Our results confirm the nucleophilic character of hydridic hydrogen atoms and the electrophilic role of the interacting elements via &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;hole interactions, consistent with established IUPAC definitions. Experimental evidence from NMR supports this classification. By clarifying these interactions&#8217; nature and directionality, we advocate for nomenclature that aligns with chemical intuition and community standards, thereby avoiding confusion caused by unnecessary redefinitions.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Heterochiral and Homochiral Peptides Conjugated to PNA Dimers and Their Integration in Peptide&#8208;Based Hydrogels</title>

Homochiral PNA&#8208;peptide conjugates mixed to homochiral peptides yield hydrogels supporting cell growth.








Abstract
Hybrid biomolecules composed of short peptides and nucleic acid analogues can self&#8208;assemble and are good candidates to produce new materials thanks to their biocompatibility and versatility. The assembly occurs by exploiting hydrogen bonds and stacking interactions between nucleobases and amino acids. The organization of the molecules at the supramolecular level is dictated by the structure of the assembling units. In this work we explored the effect of chirality on the self&#8208;assembly of PNA&#8208;peptide conjugates. We focused on homochiral and heterochiral peptides conjugated to PNA dimers and we characterized by spectroscopic techniques the assembled objects. Furthermore, we investigated the ability of the conjugates to form hydrogels in combination with the peptides. The architecture of the assembled molecules in the hydrogels was investigated, as well as the ability of hydrogels to support cell growth. Interestingly, hydrogels formed by homochiral and heterochiral mixtures show pores of different size. In the hydrogels cells grow along a specific direction, dictated by the fiber axis formed by the assembled compounds and their viability seems related to the gel pore size.

         <title>Unraveling Solvent&#8208;Dependent Chirality Inversion in the Self&#8208;Assembly of Glutamide Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide glutamide amphiphile (18NG) self&#8208;assembles into oppositely chiral supramolecular structures in MCH and DMSO, accompanied by a circular dichroism (CD) signal amplification due to the conformational transition of 18NG from folded to extended.








Abstract
This study investigates the solvent&#8208;modulated supramolecular chirality and assembly kinetics of two naphthalimide structural isomers, 18NG and 23NG, designed from glutamide derivatives linked to 1,8&#8208; and 2,3&#8208;naphthalic anhydrides, respectively. Time&#8208;dependent circular dichroism (CD) spectra reveal that 18NG exhibits chiroptical signal amplification with aging time and solvent&#8208;dependent chirality inversion: In methylcyclohexane (MCH), it forms chiral assemblies with a positive Cotton effect, whereas in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), it exhibits a negative Cotton effect. FT&#8208;IR and XRD analyses demonstrate stronger amide&#8211;amide hydrogen bonds in MCH and dominant hydrophobic interaction in DMSO, where DMSO acts as both a hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor (competing with intermolecular hydrogen bonds) and a high&#8208;polarity solvent promoting alkyl&#8208;chain aggregation. In contrast, 23NG assembles rapidly in both solvents without chirality inversion due to pre&#8208;exposed hydrogen&#8208;bonding motifs. These findings show how solvent dictates supramolecular chirality and packing by modulating noncovalent interactions, while structural isomerism governs assembly kinetics and solvent responsiveness. This work provides insights for designing adaptive chiral nanomaterials through molecular structure and solvent control.

         <title>Hierarchical MnO2 Nanoflowers and SnO2 Nanoparticles on Rhombohedral LaMnO3 for 2&#160;V Supercapacitor Electrodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A symmetric 2&#160;V aqueous symmetric supercapacitor using LaMnO3/MnO2 nanoflower hierarchical electrodes prepared using a simple direct chemical synthesis method exhibits superior performance over bare LaMnO3 and MnO2 electrodes. The enhanced performance is attributed to the effective Mn3+/Mn4+ redox transitions, improved interfacial charge transport, and synergistic interactions enabled by the hierarchical architecture.








Abstract
The strategy of forming hierarchical nanostructures of electroactive materials has shown enhancements in supercapacitor performances. In this study, two hierarchical electrodes are prepared by directly growing MnO2 nanoflowers and SnO2 nanoparticles on rhombohedral LaMnO3 nanostructures using a facile method. An extended potential window of 2&#160;V in a neutral aqueous electrolyte with superior electrochemical characteristics compared to pristine LaMnO3 electrodes is exhibited by these electrodes. Moreover, LaMnO3/MnO2 shows the best performance among the two hierarchical nanostructures. The optimized LaMnO3/MnO2 electrode delivers a high capacity of 426 C g&#8722;1 at a current density of 1 A g&#8722;1, nearly 4.6 times compared to pristine LaMnO3. This hierarchical electrode, due to the synergistic effect, exhibits appreciable cycling stability, outperforming the electrodes based on pristine MnO2 and LaMnO3. The aqueous symmetric supercapacitor fabricated using this electrode shows a capacity of 64 C g&#8722;1 (32 F g&#8722;1) at 1 A g&#8722;1, with a high energy density of 17.8 Whkg&#8722;1 at a constant power density of 2000&#160;W kg&#8722;1. Further, the device delivers 89% of its initial capacitance even after 10 000 charge/discharge operations at 10 A g&#8722;1. This study presents the possibility of using these hierarchical nanostructures in high&#8208;performance aqueous electrolyte supercapacitors (SCs).

In this study, two hierarchical electrodes are prepared by directly growing MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoflowers and SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles on rhombohedral LaMnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanostructures using a facile method. An extended potential window of 2&#160;V in a neutral aqueous electrolyte with superior electrochemical characteristics compared to pristine LaMnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; electrodes is exhibited by these electrodes. Moreover, LaMnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; shows the best performance among the two hierarchical nanostructures. The optimized LaMnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrode delivers a high capacity of 426 C g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at a current density of 1 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, nearly 4.6 times compared to pristine LaMnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. This hierarchical electrode, due to the synergistic effect, exhibits appreciable cycling stability, outperforming the electrodes based on pristine MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and LaMnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The aqueous symmetric supercapacitor fabricated using this electrode shows a capacity of 64 C g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (32 F g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) at 1 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, with a high energy density of 17.8 Whkg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at a constant power density of 2000&#160;W kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Further, the device delivers 89% of its initial capacitance even after 10 000 charge/discharge operations at 10 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This study presents the possibility of using these hierarchical nanostructures in high-performance aqueous electrolyte supercapacitors (SCs).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Deep&#8208;Learning Driven Identification of Novel Antimicrobial Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using an AI&#8208;driven pipeline that couples HydrAMP sequence generation with AMPlify activity scoring, we evolved a short tryptophan&#8208;rich parent peptide into a mini&#8208;library of analogues, screened them in silico, and validated the top hits experimentally. The lead candidate, AMP3, shows high antimicrobial activity and membrane&#8208;disruptive ability, demonstrating the power of DL and rational peptide engineering to accelerate antimicrobial peptide discovery.








Abstract
In this study, we report the identification of novel antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) via a machine learning&#8208;driven pipeline. Short Trp&#8208;rich peptide sequences were obtained using the HydrAMP deep learning (DL) algorithm, followed by the in silico screening for antimicrobial activity via the AMPlify DL model. Three candidates, namely AMP1, AMP2, and AMP3, were selected for synthesis and experimental validation. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated in vitro against a panel of Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacterial strains. Among them, AMP3 demonstrated the broader antibacterial spectrum. To investigate the mechanisms of action, we conducted detailed biophysical analyses of AMP3 interaction with liposomal models of bacterial membranes. The data revealed significant perturbation of membrane bilayer stability, supporting the proposed membrane&#8208;targeting activity of AMP3. Overall, our results underscore the potential of DL approaches for the accelerated discovery and mechanistic characterization of novel AMPs.

         <title>Mechanism of Oxidative C&#9472;H Bond Activation by De Novo Designed Artificial Cu Metalloenzymes Using H2O2 and O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanism of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde peroxidation by de novo&#8208;designed Artificial Cu Proteins (ArCuPs) is investigated. A PCET step involving H+ transfer from benzylic C&#9472;H bond to CuII&#9472;OH and ET from O&#8208;centered substrate radical to CuII is found to be the RDS. Outer&#8208;sphere steric modifications alter reactivity. The most active variant produces the least amount of detrimental OH and is the most thermostable. 








Abstract
De novo&#8208;designed artificial Cu protein (ArCuP), 3SCC, featuring a trigonal Cu(His)3 binding environment, activates H2O2, O2, and benzylic C&#9472;H bonds of abiotic substrates. We outline the mechanism of ArCuP&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;H peroxidation of one such abiotic substrate, the peroxidation of benzyl alcohol (BA) to benzaldehyde. The CuI(H2O2) complex undergoes homolytic cleavage, producing CuII&#8208;OH and &#8226;OH, akin to the lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs). The rate&#8208;limiting step is found in a PCET process, where the CuII&#8208;OH species accepts the benzylic C&#9472;H proton, accompanied by electron transfer from the O&#8208;centered substrate radical, to produce benzaldehyde. The C&#9472;H peroxidation is modulated by outer&#8208;sphere modifications, with the I12A&#8208;3SCC variant having the highest catalytic proficiency. Combined &#8226;OH monitoring and proteomics analysis reveal that the I12A variant produces the least amount of &#8226;OH, indicating no oxidation of the active site His residues, unlike other ArCuPs. The chemical and thermal stability of the I12A variant contributes to its superior reactivity. The presence of substrate significantly lowers protein&#8208;level oxidation, similar to LPMOs and other Cu and heme&#8208;based enzymes.

         <title>Chemical Properties of an Aryloxenium Cation with a Triplet Electronic Ground State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryloxenium cations contain a formally positively&#8208;charged, monovalent oxygen atom with an incomplete electron shell. In spite of this unusual structural element, they are key intermediates in many important processes, such as biological oxidation reactions and the industrial generation of thermoplastics. However, the development of new applications is hindered by the lack of knowledge on their fundamental chemical properties. While most past studies have focused on aryloxenium cations with singlet electronic ground states, minor structural modifications can produce aryloxenium cations that have a triplet ground state. Unfortunately, examination of the reactivity of triplet aryloxenium cations is limited to just two studies that reported the detection of H atom abstraction from solvents. A detailed kinetic reactivity study involving cyclohexane, allyl iodide and dimethyl disulfide reagents is reported here for an aryloxenium cation with a triplet electronic ground state, the 2&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;pyridyloxenium cation.</dc:description>
