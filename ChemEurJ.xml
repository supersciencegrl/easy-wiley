         <title>The Molecular Properties of Honey Bee Acetylcholinesterase Reveal Opportunities to Avoid Off&#8208;Target Effects in Insecticide Discovery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) regulates nerve signalling and is a well&#8208;validated target for insect control in both agriculture and the prevention of mosquito&#8208;borne diseases. However, current AChE&#8208;targeting insecticides are non&#8208;specific and thus also affect other organisms such as honey bees. The synaptic AChE of honey bees (AChE2) is encoded by the ace&#8208;2 gene, thought to have originated from a gene duplication of ace&#8208;1. Here, we analyse the structure, dynamics, and kinetics of AChE2 enzymes from the honey bee, Apis mellifera (AmAChE2), and the malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae (AgAChE2), and compare them to the more extensively studied type 1 mosquito AChE (AgAChE1) and mammalian AChEs. Important differences between these AChE subtypes were identified. Profiling with selected non&#8208;covalent AChE inhibitors revealed strong AChE2 inhibitors, but the inhibition profiles of AChE2 differed substantially from those for AgAChE1 and human AChE. Modelling of AChE2&#8226;inhibitor complexes revealed two tyrosines unique to AChE2 that are responsible for these differences in inhibitor sensitivity. These results highlight the importance of considering molecular properties of AChE2 when developing AChE1 inhibitors for pest control. Furthermore, the results also suggest that including AChE2 in computer&#8208;aided molecular design efforts during the discovery process could be very valuable for reducing risks of off&#8208;target effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Supercritical CO2&#8208;Induced Ferromagnetism in 2D C3N4 for Catalysis in Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exploration of high&#8208;efficient catalysts has been an essential challenge for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) amorphous carbon nitride (a&#8208;C3N4) with obvious ferromagnetism was achieved through a typical supercritical CO2 (SC CO2) treatment process. The experimental results revealed the structural and chemical transformations during the formation of a&#8208;C3N4. Subsequently, a&#8208;C3N4 anchored with Ru nanoparticles (Ru/a&#8208;C3N4) was successfully synthesized and employed as a catalyst for the electrocatalytic HER, exhibiting a significantly enhanced catalytic performance compared to Ru nanoparticles anchored on 2D graphitized carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) without SC CO2 treatment. DFT calculations further demonstrate that the ferromagnetic g&#8208;C3N4 substrate not only promotes disassociation of water molecules under alkaline conditions, but also influences the charge distribution and modulates the free energy of H adsorption, finally accelerating the HER kinetics. These results impart significant insights into the electrocatalytic HER process and establish a foundation for the design of advanced catalysts with enhanced performance for energy conversion and storage applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Vinylene&#8208;Linked Fully Conjugated 3D Covalent Organic Polymers for Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic polymers (COPs), featuring conjugated architectures, high porosity, and structural tenability, have emerged as promising candidates for photocatalytic applications. However, the design and synthesis of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) sp2&#8208;carbon&#8208;conjugated COPs, along with their photocatalytic performances, remain underexplored. Here, we synthesized two novel vinylene&#8208;linked fully conjugated 3D COPs (BUCT&#8208;COP&#8208;50 and BUCT&#8208;COP&#8208;51) through the saddle&#8208;shaped building blocks. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation, both materials demonstrated efficient hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation, with BUCT&#8208;COP&#8208;51 (thiophene&#8208;enriched) achieving a remarkable production rate of 3.21 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 in pure water, higher than BUCT&#8208;COP&#8208;50 (benzene&#8208;modified, 2.16 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1). Mechanistic investigations revealed that the H2O2 generation predominantly proceeded via the indirect two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction pathway. The superior performance for BUCT&#8208;COP&#8208;51 could attributed to its narrower bandgap, broader light absorption range, and higher conductivity. This work illustrates that vinylene&#8208;linked fully conjugated 3D COPs could be as promising semiconductors in environmental and energy&#8208;related fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Progress and Development Trends in the Research and Application of Anti&#8208;Icing Coatings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the anti&#8208;icing capabilities and mechanisms of superhydrophobic coatings, super&#8208;slippery coatings (SLIPS), and energy conversion coatings based on their chemical nature. It also encapsulates the development of both monofunctional and multifunctional coatings in anti&#8208;icing applications, evaluates their respective advantages and disadvantages, and delves into the future outlook as well as potential problem&#8208;solving approaches.








Abstract
Annual global economic losses from equipment icing exceed USD 180 billion, with indirect losses being even harder to quantify. Coatings are a highly effective method for preventing equipment from freezing. This paper reviews the research progress of anti&#8208;icing coatings and analyzes future development trends. It evaluates the anti&#8208;icing capabilities of superhydrophobic coatings, slippery liquid&#8208;infused porous surfaces (SLIPS), and energy&#8208;conversion coatings based on their material characteristics and anti&#8208;icing mechanisms. Furthermore, the paper examines the anti&#8208;icing applications of single&#8208;and multifunctional coatings, assesses the advantages and disadvantages of their preparation technologies and material properties, and identifies the main problems in practical applications of current anti&#8208;icing coatings. Finally, it highlights the potential of active anti&#8208;icing functional coatings, particularly energy&#8208;conversion coatings. Through interdisciplinary material innovation and technological exploration, these coatings could enable all&#8208;weather and sustainable anti&#8208;icing solutions.

         <title>Dual Organic Solvents Enable Stable Zn Anodes via Simultaneous Electrolyte Structure and Interface Chemistry Regulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable Zn plating/stripping process can be achieved by simultaneous optimization of bulk electrolyte structures and anode&#8208;electrolyte interfacial chemistry in a hydrous dual organic electrolyte system, using Zn(OTf)2 dissolved in DME and DX.








Abstract
Metallic Zn is an exceptionally promising anode material for aqueous batteries due to its inherent safety, low cost, and high theoretical capacity. However, its widespread application has been severely limited by persistent challenges, including water&#8208;induced parasitic reactions and uncontrolled dendritic growth. Herein, a hydrous dual organic electrolyte system with modulated bulk electrolyte structures and anode&#8208;electrolyte interfacial chemistry has been developed to address the above obstacles, featuring Zn trifluoromethanesulfonate (Zn(OTf)2) dissolved in 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME) and 1,4&#8208;dioxane (DX). In such a system, DME can effectively disrupt the hydrogen bond network of water molecules through its electron&#8208;donating properties, thereby significantly suppressing water activity and associated side reactions, while DX preferentially adsorbs at the anode/electrolyte interface to facilitate Zn2+ desolvation and promote the preferential growth of (002)&#8208;oriented Zn crystals. The optimized electrolyte system endows Zn anodes with exceptional electrochemical performance, demonstrating unprecedented cycling stability (4000 hours at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/1 mAh cm&#8722;2) in the Zn//Zn cell and outstanding Coulombic efficiency (CE) (99.8% over 2000 cycles) in the Zn//Cu cell. Moreover, the full battery paired with Na2V6O16 (NVO)demonstrates excellent cycling stability with 79.0% capacity retention at 5 A g&#8722;1 after 2000 cycles.

         <title>In Situ Construction of RuS2&#8208;MoO3/MoS2 Heterostructure for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution in Alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The RuS2&#8208;MoO3/MoS2 material with enriched heterostructures was successfully prepared through simple hydrothermal and sulfidation approach. This heterostructure enhances the activity of RuS2 for alkaline HER to charged interactions between RuS2 and MoO3/MoS2 with accelerating the rate of water dissociation. It achieves 51 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and Tafel slope of 46 mV dec&#8722;1.








Abstract
The investigation of an electrocatalyst that integrates both high activity and cost&#8208;effectiveness to enhance the sluggish kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) during water reduction constitutes a significant scientific challenge. Herein, we present an electrocatalyst that RuS2 nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed onto MoO3/MoS2 nanosheets support to obtain abundant heterojunction interfaces of RuS2&#8208;MoO3/MoS2 for efficient HER. It enhanced the activity of RuS2 for alkaline HER to charged interactions between RuS2 and MoO3/MoS2 with accelerating the rate of water dissociation and optimizing the reaction kinetics. RuS2&#8208;MoO3/MoS2 heterostructure exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for alkaline HER, showing a low overpotential of only 51&#160;mV at current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a low Tafel slope of 46&#160;mV dec&#8722;1, outperforming commercial Pt/C and most previously reported alkaline HER electrocatalysts. Moreover, it also has outstanding long&#8208;term stability, capable of maintaining current densities of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for durations exceeding 500 hours and 100 hours under the chronoamperometric method, respectively. This research offers novel insights and clear guidance for the development of high&#8208;performance, cost&#8208;effective RuS2 electrocatalysts.

         <title>Selective and Waste&#8208;Free Isolation of High Purity Primary Amines from Amine and Reaction Mixtures by Selective Ammonium Carbamate Crystallization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesizing primary amines either leads to a challenging separation from secondary and tertiary amine side products or a separation of the desired product from a selective homogeneous catalyst. This work presents an efficient isolation strategy based on CO2&#8208;induced waste&#8208;free and reversible salt formation combined with selective crystallization.








Abstract
The isolation of primary amines from secondary and tertiary amines presents a significant challenge in their sustainable production, and existing strategies are either multistep, energy&#8208;demanding, or waste&#8208;intensive. We present an efficient process that utilizes the distinct solubility profiles of ammonium carbamate species formed through waste&#8208;free and reversible salt formation of primary amines and CO2. This selective ammonium carbamate crystallization (SACC) enables the purification of challenging amine mixtures. Starting from 35% initial primary amine purity, SACC achieves very high isolated yields of up to 94% and excellent purities exceeding 99%. Additionally, the separation of secondary from tertiary amines with 86% yield and 91% purity and the fractional crystallization of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines with yields ranging from 83% to 94% and purities from 90% to&#160;&gt;&#160;99% were successfully achieved. SACC was also successfully employed in the alcohol amination with ammonia/ammonia alkylation to isolate primary amines with high yields of up to 84% and excellent purities exceeding 99% using a homogeneous Ru/xantphos catalyst system. The observed average metal and phosphorus losses were at a minimal level of&#160;&lt;&#160;1&#160;wt% of the initial amounts. Based on this high catalyst retention, the additional potential of SACC for recycling the homogeneous catalyst was demonstrated.

         <title>Computational Study on the Relationship between Charge Localization and Second Hyperpolarizability in Mixed&#8208;Valence Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular systems with symmetric resonance structures with invertible polarization (SRIP) have been reported to exhibit negative second hyperpolarizability, which is unusual for ordinal molecular systems. We herein report that mixed&#8208;valance systems can also be recognized as SRIP systems showing negative second hyperpolarizability. Since electronic structures of MV systems are often represented by the Robin&#8211;Day classification, we theoretically investigated the correlation between the Robin&#8211;Day class and second hyperpolarizability &#947; in simple MV systems such as He2&#183;+ and biaryl derivatives. We found that the absolute value of &#947; increases and its sign reverses near the boundary of the Robin&#8211;Day class&#8208;III and II, where the charge begins to localize. The significant validation of &#947; was rationalized by the context of the intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) transitions, which are unique to MV systems. The calculated &#947; for MV systems is more than 100 times larger in absolute value than in the neutral state near the charge localization boundary, and the sign of &#947; switches at the class&#8208;II/III boundary. These results suggest that the nonlinear optical response of materials can be significantly switched by redox stimuli.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid and&#160;Efficient&#160;Solid&#8208;state Mechanosynthesis of Bipyridine Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2,2'&#8208;bipyridine is considered to be the most widely used&#160;ligand and it has been extensively studied especially in the areas of coordination chemistry, medicine, materials and catalysis. A mechanochemical reaction is a process that involves the application of mechanical energy and it provides a high yield in a shorter reaction time and eliminates the need for bulk solvents, typically request in solvothermal reaction.
Notwithstanding the importance of the synthesis of bipyridine&#8208;metal compounds for several decades and recent advancements in the mechanochemical synthesis the development of a mechanochemical protocol for the synthesis of metal complexes bearing bipyridine remains unexplored.
In this work, we extensively studied the mechanochemistry reaction of more than ten metallic precursors of Ru, Ir, Pt, Pd, Fe, and Co with 2,2'&#8208;bipyridine in different stoichiometric ratio without utilization of bulk solvents, under ambient conditions and without air&#8208;sensitive procedures. A comparison of the yield, reaction time, temperature, frequency, green metrics (E&#8208;factor and the Effective Mass Yield (EMY)) of conventional solvothermal methodologies and mechanochemical synthesis clearly indicates that the mechanochemical approach is more sustainable and efficient. Mechanochemistry approach can be complementary to common solvothermal approach, and in the future, it will be required greater attention in the field of organometallic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategies Toward Synthesis and Conversion of Lignin Model Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conversion of lignin toward value&#8208;added products relies on the cleavage of C&#9472;C and C&#9472;O bonding patterns, which has proven to be a difficult task previously, with numerous factors at play. The employment of model compounds which are fashioned on the structure and linkages found within lignin aids in the development of catalytic processes which can then be applied for the scission of linkages within native lignin. This review focuses on the strategies which have been used for the synthesis and conversion of key model compounds of lignin and the products obtained following their breakdown studies.








Abstract
The push toward a renewable society where the chemicals being used on a daily basis come from sources which are not going to be depleted within the next few decades is highly sought after. Biomass is one of the most promising opportunities to establish self&#8208;sustainability for the human race. This review article takes a look at some of the key methods which have been employed for the synthesis of important lignin model compounds, and the synthetic techniques are discussed throughout the first section. The second section of this review is focused on some of the major strategies for the conversion of lignin model compounds throughout the literature. This review serves as a good starting point for someone who is relatively new to the field of lignin model synthesis and valorization.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Planar Chiral Pillar[5]arenes via Dynamic Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric catalytic synthesis via DKR has proven to serve as a powerful tool for the efficient preparation of planar chiral pillar[5]arenes, which allows for achieving high levels of enantioinduction while producing a series of functionalized planar chiral pillar[5]arenes.








Abstract
Pillar[n]arenes are a class of emerging supramolecular macrocyclic hosts that have attracted significant attention due to their intriguing dynamic planar chirality and unique cavity structures. In particular, the conformation of pillar[5]arenes can be locked by the introduction of bulky substituents or &#960;&#8208;conjugated units at both rims, resulting in stable planar chirality. This strategy paves the way for the application of planar chiral pillar[5]arenes as versatile chiral molecular platforms. In recent years, planar chiral pillar[5]arenes have been widely applied in various research fields, such as chiral porous materials, chiral luminescent materials, and molecular machines. However, obtaining planar chiral pillar[5]arenes in enantiomeric forms remains a significant challenge. Recently, asymmetric catalytic synthesis via dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) has proven to serve as a powerful tool for the efficient preparation of planar chiral pillar[5]arenes, which allows for achieving high levels of enantioinduction while producing a series of functionalized planar chiral pillar[5]arenes. This concept summarizes these achievements and highlights the design principles and key challenges, aiming to provide valuable insights for future research.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly Methods Induce Different Individual&#8208;Polymer&#8208;Block Solvation Responses</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different processing methods of the otherwise same block copolymer produce materials that respond distinctly to solvent stimuli. FLIM, which reveals changes in the tightness or looseness of individual blocks, pinpoints these distinct responses to individual&#8208;block behaviors.








Abstract
An understanding of block&#8208;specific responses to stimuli in self&#8208;assembled copolymers is essential for the effective design of responsive materials. Here, materials formed from different post&#8208;reaction processing methods of the same ROMP block copolymer exhibit different block&#8208;specific solvent responses, as characterized in situ by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). FLIM data were acquired by tagging the polar or nonpolar block separately with a covalently incorporated viscosity&#8208;sensitive fluorescent molecular rotor to measure the changing tightness or looseness of assembly upon changes in solvent composition. Rapid precipitation from an insoluble solvent to form a film results in tighter assembly and less difference in tightness/looseness between the two blocks. Further, it interrupts individual block&#8208;solvent response behavior. Both results indicate an apparent disruption of the core&#8211;shell assembly. This model from FLIM is further supported by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) data from isolated solids, which show tighter long&#8208;range interactions and more long&#8208;range order in these kinetically trapped states. The experiments develop FLIM as a method for pinpointing stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviors from different processing methods to individual blocks. Together these outcomes provide a future handle for tailoring solvent&#8208;triggered assembly/disassembly behavior.

         <title>Study on Phosphorus Compound/Catechol&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydrative Amidation and Its Database Development for Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel phosphorus&#8208;based catalytic system for the direct amidation of carboxylic acids with amines has been developed. The efficiency of the phosphorus catalysis is substantially enhanced using catechol derivatives as additives. A vault of experimental data obtained this time was complemented with ML models, which allowed capturing the intricate catalytic behavior in the amidation system.








Abstract
Herein, we report that the catalytic activity of phosphorus compounds with a P&#9472;H bond in dehydrative amidation reactions is substantially enhanced when using catechol derivatives as additives. A systematic investigation into the catalytic activity of four phosphorus compounds and 17 catechol derivatives allowed identifying several effective combinations, for example, dimethyl phosphite and 2,3&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene, for the catalytic amidation of carboxylic acids with amines. The developed catalytic system enables the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and facilitates the amidation of anilines, which are typically considered poor substrates with low reactivity. In addition, machine&#8208;learning (ML) models were constructed to validate the effectiveness of the database generated from the above&#8208;mentioned investigation. Multilayer perceptron (MLP) models incorporating descriptors derived from both quantum chemical calculations and RDKit provided accurate predictions while maintaining chemical interpretability, which was underscored by a visual analysis using SHAP.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Polymer Networks of Silicone Elastomers via Organoborane Lewis&#8208;Pairs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DCPNs with reversible Lewis pair bonds are reported. Nitrogen&#8208;borane adducts impart dynamic mechanical properties, such as self&#8208;healing and recyclability, to polydimethylsiloxane elastomers.








Abstract
Dynamic covalent polymer networks (DCPNs) have been developed in recent years to offer distinctive mechanical properties and shape responsiveness in covalently cured polymer materials, thereby bestowing them with desirable characteristics such as self&#8208;healing and recyclability. To achieve these desirable properties, dynamic polymers incorporate reversible covalent bonds that enable shape morphing without causing irreversible chemical degradation of the network structure. Lewis pairs (LP), forming coordinate covalent bonds, sometimes referred to as dative covalent bonds, exhibit a broad range of bond dissociation rates and energies, making them inherently interesting for designing DCPNs. However, LPs have been relatively unexplored as polymer building blocks. Here, we present a straightforward approach to prepare LP&#8208;based polymers based on archetypical nitrogen&#8208;borane adducts with an organoborane&#8208;functionalized polydimethylsiloxane combined with commercially available Lewis base (LB) polymers. The dynamic behavior of the organoborane&#8208;functionalized system and LB polymers is investigated, demonstrating tunable reversibility in cured elastomers. The excess of LB facilitates rapid recapture and reformation of the covalent network, contributing to the system's reversible and self&#8208;healing nature. Notably, the system allows easy mixing of different LB polymers, enabling the creation of tuning the system, and hence organoborane&#8208;based LPs are demonstrated to be a promising building block for tunable DCPNs.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) represents a promising modality for cancer treatment; however, its clinical application is hindered by challenges such as glutathione (GSH)&#8208;mediated quenching of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and autofluorescence interference during visible light imaging. This study introduces Cy&#8208;NBD&#8208;5F, a photosensitizer engineered to address these limitations. Upon activation by GSH, Cy&#8208;NBD&#8208;5F exhibits 5.5&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement at 701 nm, producing its reduced form, Cy&#8208;OH&#8208;5F, which demonstrates enhanced ROS generation, including a 1.4&#8208;fold increase in singlet oxygen and 1.2&#8208;fold increase in superoxide anion radicals. Under light irradiation, Cy&#8208;OH&#8208;5F induces significant cytotoxicity (IC50 &lt; 3 &#956;M). Additionally, the molecule predominantly localizes within lysosomes and the endoplasmic reticulum, showing organelle&#8208;specific effects to improve therapeutic efficacy. These findings show the potential of Cy&#8208;NBD&#8208;5F as a precise and effective tool for cancer theranostics.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Directed Structure&#8208;Specific Carbon Nanothreads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon nanothread (CNTh) is a sp3&#8208;bonded one&#8208;dimensional nanomaterial that was predicted to combine the extreme strength with excellent flexibility. However, the reported CNTh usually has a non&#8208;uniform intrathread structure, and the synthesis of structure&#8208;specific CNTh is still a big challenge. Here, we selecte 1,2,3&#8208;trifluorobenzene (1,2,3&#8208;TFB) with strong dipole as precursor. By compressing 1,2,3&#8208;TFB to 20.1 GPa, a CNTh with a &#8220;zipper polymer&#8221; structure is obtained. Under applied pressure, 1,2,3&#8208;TFB are anti&#8208;parallelly stacked in column, and polymerize via selective sequential [4+2] polymerization between H&#8208;carbon dienophile / F&#8208;carbon dienophile and F, H&#8208;carbon diene within the column, followed by the &#8220;zippered&#8221; bonding of the rest atoms. The obtained CNTh is highly hydrophobic with contact angle of 124.6 &#176;. The excellent columnar anti&#8208;parallel &#960;&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;&#960; stacking and distinct reactivities of carbon atoms introduced by the F&#8208;substitution are responsible for the high reaction selectivity, which provides new insight for the precise synthesis of atom&#8208;level ordered CNThs.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Carbon nanothread (CNTh) is a sp3-bonded one-dimensional nanomaterial that was predicted to combine the extreme strength with excellent flexibility. However, the reported CNTh usually has a non-uniform intrathread structure, and the synthesis of structure-specific CNTh is still a big challenge. Here, we selecte 1,2,3-trifluorobenzene (1,2,3-TFB) with strong dipole as precursor. By compressing 1,2,3-TFB to 20.1 GPa, a CNTh with a &#8220;zipper polymer&#8221; structure is obtained. Under applied pressure, 1,2,3-TFB are anti-parallelly stacked in column, and polymerize via selective sequential [4+2] polymerization between H-carbon dienophile / F-carbon dienophile and F, H-carbon diene within the column, followed by the &#8220;zippered&#8221; bonding of the rest atoms. The obtained CNTh is highly hydrophobic with contact angle of 124.6 &#176;. The excellent columnar anti-parallel &#960;&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;&#960; stacking and distinct reactivities of carbon atoms introduced by the F-substitution are responsible for the high reaction selectivity, which provides new insight for the precise synthesis of atom-level ordered CNThs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hierarchical Assemblies of Unsymmetric Pt Complexes with Ag Ions: Two Types of Assembly Modes Depending on the Remote Ancillary Groups in the Bridging Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stepwise clusterization reactions of the (SP&#8208;4&#8208;3) and (SP&#8208;4&#8208;4) Pt complexes with Ag ions are reported. The small structural difference between the two types of Pt complexes was amplified by the hierarchical assembly process, producing different types of &#8220;cluster&#8208;of&#8208;cluster&#8221; aggregates in the crystalline state. The cluster&#8208;of&#8208;cluster complexes exhibited photoluminescence corresponding to the interaction between the Pt2Ag3 unit and Ag ions, whereas each molecular component had similar photophysical properties.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly via noncovalent interactions can amplify small structural differences in small molecular units, producing large supramolecular architectures with structure&#8208;dependent complexity and characteristics. In this paper, the unique self&#8208;assembly behaviors of mononuclear Pt(II) complex units accommodating Ag(I) ions are reported. The Pt complex with the N^C chelating ligand and two different kinds of pyrazole ligands gave two regioisomers, whose structural difference was only the position of the N and C donor atoms in the N^C chelating ligands. This small structural difference influences the assembled structures with Ag ions, producing two different types of heteropolynuclear complexes with different clustering motifs. This was further amplified via a hierarchical assembly process incorporating additional Ag ions to afford two different types of Pt&#8208;Ag cluster&#8208;of&#8208;cluster complexes. This study proves that the self&#8208;assembly of unsymmetrical fragments can endow significant complexity and perturbation in molecular systems, enabling the observation of unique molecular behaviors.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Wheel Movement in a [2]Rotaxane Using a Competing Kinetic Pathway</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In high&#8208;polarity solvent, a [2]rotaxane formed kinetic aggregates showing blue&#8211;purple locally excited emission. The kinetic aggregates gradually transformed into thermodynamic aggregates. During the transformation, the [2]rotaxane was exposed to the aqueous conditions, thus the location of the hydrophilic pillar[5]arene wheel changed, resulting in real&#8208;time monitoring of fluorescence color change from blue&#8211;purple locally excited emission to light&#8208;blue charge&#8211;transfer emission.








Abstract
The wheel movement of rotaxanes is typically fast in solution. Therefore, real&#8208;time monitoring of such movement is one of the challenging topics. Herein, we report real&#8208;time monitoring of wheel movement in a [2]rotaxane (comprising hydrophilic pillar[5]arene as a wheel and hydrophobic &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety with hydrophilic tetra(ethylene oxide) ends as an axle) via a competing kinetic pathway, i.e., aggregation/dissociation equilibrium. In non&#8208;aqueous solvent, the [2]rotaxane shows blue&#8211;purple locally excited emission from the &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety because the pillar[5]arene wheel shuttles over the whole axle. In aqueous solvent, the [2]rotaxane forms aggregates owing to its amphiphilic nature. Because the [2]rotaxane forms the kinetically stable aggregates, the location of the pillar[5]arene wheel on the axle is maintained, resulting in the locally excited emission even in the aqueous conditions. Surprisingly, the emission color gradually changes from blue&#8211;purple to light blue over 720&#160;h because exposure of the monomeric [2]rotaxane generated by dissociation of the kinetically stable aggregates, to the aqueouspola environment triggers movement of the hydrophilic wheel to the hydrophobic &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety by the hydrophobic effect. After this movement, the monomeric [2]rotaxane forms the thermodynamically stable aggregates, which exhibit light&#8208;blue emission from the charge&#8208;transfer complex between the electron&#8208;donating pillar[5]arene wheel and the electron&#8208;accepting &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety.

         <title>From Nanoparticles to Single Crystals of Al&#8208;MOFs: Synergistic Coordination and pH Modulation, and Rapid Sorption Kinetics Assessment by Optical Calorimetry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;throughput studies were carried out to elucidate the synergistic effects of coordination modulation and pH modulation on the crystal size of different Al&#8208;MOFs, resulting in nanoparticles as well as large crystals (dmax&#160;&#8776;&#160;0.1&#160;&#181;m&#160;&#8211;&#160;800&#160;&#181;m). In addition, the influence of particle size on CO2 sorption properties was investigated, showing increasing adsorption and desorption rates with decreasing particle size.








Abstract
The properties of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), such as sorption kinetics or mechanical and chemical stability, not only depend on their composition and chemical structure, but also on their crystal size and morphology. However, the tunability of the crystallite size of aluminum&#8208;based MOFs (Al&#8208;MOFs) is still a long&#8208;standing challenge. In this study, we present systematic high&#8208;throughput investigations elucidating the synergistic effects of different mono&#8208; and dicarboxylic acids (acetic acid, malonic acid, and oxalic acid) as coordination modulators and NaOH as a pH modulator on the crystal size of various Al&#8208;MOFs, with a focus on Al&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;NO2. By varying the type and amount of coordination modulators, we successfully extended the range of achievable particle sizes to nanoparticles as well as large crystals (dmax&#160;&#8776;&#160;100&#160;nm&#160;&#8211;&#160;800&#160;&#181;m) compared to traditional synthesis methods using only coordination modulators. Thus, large crystals as well as nanoparticles of different Al&#8208;MOFs could be obtained by simply varying the molar ratio of the different modulators. Additionally, we explored the influence of particle size on CO2 sorption properties using InfraSORP technology (optical calorimetry), revealing the increase in adsorption rates with decreasing particle size.

         <title>A Tour in the Chemistry of a Tricoordinate Rh(&#8208;I) Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The finding of the unprecedented 16&#8208;e tricoordinate planar rhodium(&#8208;I) complex, K[Rh(IPr)(dvtms)] (K[1]) (IPr = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolyl&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene, dvtms = divinyltretramethyldisiloxane) prompted us to explore its reactivity. K[1] reacts as a nucleophile with methyliodide to give [Rh(IPr)(dvtms)Me], a Rh(I) compound with an exceptional trigonal&#8208;pyramidal structure. Other haloalkanes abstract one electron from K[1] to give the previously reported [Rh0(IPr)(dvtms)] complex. K[1] reacts also with protonic acids and weak proton sources such as water and ketones to give eventually the rare tricoordinate 14&#8208;electron complex [RhI(IPr)(SiMe2OSiMe2CH=CH2)] with a Rh&#8208;Si bond. The 16&#8208;electron complex [RhI(IPr)(SiMe2OSiMe2CH=CH2)(H2C=CH2)] was characterized as an intermediate in this reaction. Furthermore, K[1] runs up to five cycles of catalytic condensation of non&#8208;enolizable aldehydes to esters, such as p&#8208;tolylaldehyde, before being fully converted into the inactive complex Rh(IPr)(&#951;3&#8208;C3H4ptolyl)(C2H4)] with fragmentation of the diolefin dvtms. Computational studies have provided valuable insights into the reactivity patterns and behavior of this complex, including those of the rhodium(&#8208;I)/rhodium(I) catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Orthogonal Photoswitching in Nematic Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoresponsive materials capable of orthogonal and path&#8208;independent switching are crucial for developing adaptive materials and smart technologies. In this work, we showcase a dual light&#8208;responsive nematic liquid crystalline system based on peri&#8208;anthracenethioindigo (PAT) and arylazopyrazole (AAP) doped into the liquid crystal 4&#8208;cyano&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;pentylbiphenyl (5CB). The co&#8208;assembled supramolecular material exhibits a reversible phase transition between the nematic liquid crystalline and isotropic liquid state upon irradiation with different wavelengths of light ranging from ultraviolet to near infrared. These transformations are clearly visible using polarized optical microscopy, displaying either bright or completely dark images depending on the phase state. A key feature of this system is its ability to achieve independent and highly efficient photoisomerization of both photoswitches, ensuring orthogonality and path independence in solution as well as in the liquid crystalline phase. This orthogonal switching capability enables precise and reversible modulation of material properties, allowing sequential interconversion between multiple distinct states. Such a system represents an important proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for future multifunctional materials that leverage light as a non&#8208;invasive external stimulus.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly, Aggregation Mechanisms, and Morphological Properties of Asymmetric Perylene Diimide&#8208;based Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability to control the self&#8208;assembly behavior of functional molecules offers pathways for optimizing their properties and structures for targeted applications. Asymmetric perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives, bearing similar oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) chains and increasing numbers of hydrophobic alkyl chains were used to investigate the effects of hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups on the properties of the resulting supramolecular polymers (SMPs). Tetrahydrofuran/water (THF/H2O) mixtures were found to be an optimal system to induce the self&#8208;assembly behavior of these asymmetric PDI derivatives; the behavior of these new systems was monitored by recording ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV/Vis) spectra and analyzing changes in absorbance intensity. Temperature&#8208;dependent UV/Vis studies yielded thermodynamic parameters for the self&#8208;assembly processes and showed a transition from an isodesmic to a cooperative assembly mechanism with an increase in the number of hydrophobic alkyl chains. Detailed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) investigations revealed the formation of nanofiber&#8208;based supramolecular structures that exhibit a coiling tendency during their assembly process accompanied by the increase in the number (and total volume) of hydrophobic alkyl chains. Exploring these carefully tuned asymmetric PDI systems provides new opportunities to tune not only self&#8208;assembled structures, but also mechanisms of assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of the Substitution Pattern of Terpene&#8208;Based Seven&#8208;Membered Lactones on Yttrium&#8208;Mediated Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization: A Kinetic and Mechanistic Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Terpenes exhibit a wide range of structures, thus enabling diverse applications. Herein, (&#8208;)&#8208;menthide and trans (+)&#8208;carvomenthide were synthesized from terpenoids (&#8208;)&#8208;menthone and (+)&#8208;dihydrocarvone, differing solely in their substitution pattern. (&#8208;)&#8208;Menthide features a methyl group at position 4 and an isopropyl group at position 7, whereas (+)&#8208;carvomenthide shows the inverse arrangement. Both lactones were transformed into polyesters via ring&#8208;opening polymerization using an amino&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;bis(phenolate) yttrium catalyst. Polymerization kinetics revealed first&#8208;order behavior, with (+)&#8208;carvomenthide polymerizing significantly faster than (&#8208;)&#8208;menthide, while (&#8208;)&#8208;menthide demonstrated a more controlled polymerization. Activation energies were 36.3 kJ mol&#8208;1 for (+)&#8208;carvomenthide and 40.8 kJ mol&#8208;1 for (&#8208;)&#8208;menthide. The Gibbs free energy of activation confirmed the lower energy barrier for (+)&#8208;carvomenthide polymerization, with experimental values of 81.9 kJ mol&#8208;1 compared to 89.1 kJ mol&#8208;1 for (&#8208;)&#8208;menthide. DFT calculations supported the experimental results, with computed Gibbs free energy barriers of 84.5 kJ mol&#8208;1 for trans (+)&#8208;carvomenthide and 82.3 kJ mol&#8208;1 for (&#8208;)&#8208;menthide and mechanistic differences. Refined free energy barriers were determined to be 102.1 kJ mol&#8315;1 for (&#8208;)&#8208;menthide and 84.9 kJ mol&#8315;1 for trans (+)&#8208;carvomenthide, agreeing with the experimental trend. These findings highlight the critical role of molecular structure and substituent position on polymerization kinetics and energy barriers in metal&#8208;catalyzed polymerization</dc:description>

Herein, (-)-menthide and trans (+)-carvomenthide were synthesized from terpenoids (-)-menthone and (+)-dihydrocarvone, differing solely in their substitution pattern. (-)-Menthide features a methyl group at position 4 and an isopropyl group at position 7, whereas (+)-carvomenthide shows the inverse arrangement. Both lactones were transformed into polyesters via ring-opening polymerization using an amino-alkoxy-bis(phenolate) yttrium catalyst. Polymerization kinetics revealed first-order behavior, with (+)-carvomenthide polymerizing significantly faster than (-)-menthide, while (-)-menthide demonstrated a more controlled polymerization. Activation energies were 36.3 kJ mol-1 for (+)-carvomenthide and 40.8 kJ mol-1 for (-)-menthide.

         <title>BICAAC Supported Germylenes and Stannylenes: Isolation of BICAAC Stabilized Germylone and a Digermanium Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we have disclosed the successful isolation and spectroscopic characterization of a series of bicyclic (alkyl)(amino) carbene (Me/iPrBICAAC) complexes of GeCl2 and SnX2; [MeBICAAC&#8208;GeCl2 (1); iPrBICAAC&#8208;GeCl2 (2); MeBICAAC&#8208;SnX2 (X = Cl (3); X = Br, (4))]. The in&#8208;situ KC8 reduction of GeCl2&#183;dioxane in the presence of MeBICAAC led to the isolation of a zero&#8208;valent di&#8208;coordinated germylone [(MeBICAAC)2Ge] (5), whereas the reduction of adduct 2 afforded a trans&#8208;bent digermanium complex, [iPrBICAAC&#8594;GeGe&#8592;iPrBICAAC] (6), having a GeGe (2.3652(5) &#197; ) double bond. Additionally, complexes 3 and 4 were reacted with diironnonacarbonyl Fe2(CO)9 to produce the corresponding Sn&#8594;Fe adducts 7 and 8, respectively. Further, attempts were made to convert the MeBICAAC&#8208;Sn adducts 3 and 4 to the corresponding tin&#8208;hydride complex, by treatment with LiBH4, however, in both the attempts, uncontrolled hydrogenation occurred to give the dihydrogented MeBICAAC complex, MeBICAAC(H2) (9). The solid&#8208;state structures of compounds 1&#8208;8 have also been elucidated using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction technique. Further, computational investigations were performed to explain the bonding situation in 3&#8208;8 that establishes the ylidone character of 5, and supports the formation of 7&#8208;8 via donation of the lone pair at Sn to the Fe center.</dc:description>

         <title>Mono&#8208; IrIII&#160;versus heterobimetallic IrIII&#8208;AuI&#160;complexes for circularly polarized luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fundamental rationalization of the structural&#8211;circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity relationship is a challenging task. Herein, a pair of enantiopure, heterobimetallic IrIII&#8211;AuI&#160;complexes&#160;IrAu&#8208;4&#160;featuring chirality&#8208;at&#8208;metal is thoroughly investigated by means of spectroscopical and computational techniques, also including spin&#8208;orbital coupling (SOC) effects. Upon resolution of the racemic mixture of the starting chloro&#8208;bridged dimer via a chiral auxiliary ligand, the complexes IrIII&#8211;AuI&#160;are straightforwardly prepared in a stepwise procedure with retention of configuration in good yields. The&#160;IrAu&#8208;4&#160;complexes display moderate orange phosphorescence arising from an admixed metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand and ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MLCT/3LLCT) excited state and good chiroptical activity, as shown by both electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and CPL spectroscopy. A comparison between the parental mononuclear pairs&#160;&#916;&#8208;Ir(ppy)2(acac)&#160;and&#160;&#923;&#8208;Ir(ppy)2(acac)&#160;and the binuclear&#160;IrAu&#8208;4&#160;counterparts also provides interesting insights. The latter possess higher dissymmetry factor (glum) values despite the very similar ECD activity of the lower&#8208;lying&#160;1MLCT band with enantiospecific polarization bias of the light dictated by the chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal configuration. The different nature of the emissive excited state between the two families of complexes and its implication onto the radiative rate constant and the dipolar force is tentatively accounted for the increased CPL&#8208;activity observed in&#160;IrAu&#8208;4.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Cholesteric liquid crystal polymer network (CLCN) patterns based on polyacrylate have attracted much attention for the applications in decoration and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Although epoxy resin&#8208;based CLCN patterns can be prepared using themochromic cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs), it is hard to prepare them in a large scale on coating lines. Herein, a photochromic CLC mixture was prepared using a reactive epoxy liquid crystal and a photoisomerizable chiral dopant. Driven by the photoisomerization of the chiral dopant, the selective Bragg reflection band of the CLC mixture redshifted with increasing the 365&#8208;nm UV light irradiation time. Due to the high viscosity of the CLC mixture, the reflection band of the irradiated CLC mixture was both time&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent. After photopolymerization, the structural color was fixed. By precisely controlling the annealing time after the photoisomerization of the chiral dopant or the irradiation time for photoisomerization, colorful epoxy resin patterns were prepared, which have potential applications in decoration and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.</dc:description>

         <title>Aryl Shift Rearrangement in Scholl&#8208;Type Reaction Toward Nanographene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Scholl&#8208;type reaction involving both 1,4&#8208;aryl&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;aryl shift rearrangements was discovered, converting a Z&#8208;shaped precursor into nanographene. We establish the principle of the rearrangement mechanism through thermodynamic and kinetic studies using DFT. Our findings indicate that the selection of arenium cation&#8208; or radical cation mechanisms depends on the sizes and positions of the shifting aryl groups.








Abstract
Oxidative dehydrogenation, known as Scholl reaction, is a powerful method for synthesizing many polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Sometimes, unexpected rearrangements can lead to the formation of new structures that are usually difficult to obtain. Here, we discover a novel Scholl&#8208;type reaction involving both 1,4&#8208;aryl&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;aryl shift rearrangements, resulting in the production of armchair nanographene. Additionally, we establish the principle of the rearrangement mechanism through thermodynamic and kinetic studies using density functional theory (DFT). Theoretical studies indicate that the rearrangement reaction involves both arenium cation&#8208; and radical cation mechanisms. The selection of arenium cation&#8208; or radical cation mechanisms depends on the sizes and positions of the shifting aryl groups. Large biphenyl or triphenylenyl groups undergo the arenium cation mechanism, while a small monophenyl group favors the radical cation mechanism. Our findings offer new insights into the controllable rearrangements in Scholl reaction and provide new synthetic methods for obtaining a variety of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are typically challenging to design.

         <title>A Ketol&#8208;Acid Reductoisomerase Inhibitor That Has Antituberculosis and Herbicidal Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1a and 1f are potent inhibitors of ketolacid reductoisomerase (KARI). 1f has good antituberculosis activity and 1a has herbicidal activity against Brassica campestris and Amaranthus retroflexus.








Abstract
Ketol&#8208;acid reductoisomerase (KARI) is a target for the development of new biocidal agents. This is based on its essential role in branched chain amino acid biosynthesis in plants and microorganisms, and its absence in animals. The lack of success in developing KARI inhibitors as biocides may be because the inhibitors assessed to date compete directly with the substrate, 2&#8208;acetolactate (AL). As a result, effectiveness diminishes when AL accumulates in cells. Furthermore, as these inhibitors are slow binding, an organism could avoid growth slowdown by increasing KARI production. Here, we show a pyrimidinedione, 1f is a competitive but time&#8208;dependent inhibitor of AL and NADPH for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mt) KARI (Ki = 23.3&#160;nM). A crystal structure of this compound bound to the MtKARI homolog from Staphylococcus aureus (Sa), SaKARI, illustrates this dual competition. In contrast, for Oryza sativa KARI, no time&#8208;dependent inhibition by 1f is observed, though it inhibits AL competitively (146&#160;nM) and NADPH uncompetitively. Despite differences in inhibition properties, 1f has an MIC of 12.7&#160;&#181;m for MtH37Rv and inhibits Brassica campestris growth by 63% at 10&#160;mg mL&#8722;1. Therefore, KARI inhibitors that are competitive for NADPH and show no time&#8208;dependent inhibition have excellent potential as biocides.

         <title>Olefin&#8208;Catalyzed Aromatic Bromination toward Biocompatible Tyrosine Modification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocompatible catalysis for aromatic bromination was attained via olefin&#8208;to&#8208;aromatic ring transfer of Br+. Bifunctional cyclooctenes catalyzed the bromination of phenol derivatives, which was applicable in tyrosine modification, and realized light&#8208;gated catalysis. Such olefin catalysis was compatible with aqueous conditions, enabling the bromination of peptides, and the Lewis&#8208;base catalysis of the olefins proceeded even under acidic conditions.








Abstract
The chemical modification of biomolecules is an emerging technique for studying and manipulating biological mechanisms. Among these methods, catalysis offers advantages over stoichiometric strategies due to its ability to enhance selectivity, for example, spatiotemporal control, via catalytic turnover, and the modification of tyrosine recently attracts considerable attention due to its significant biological functions. However, catalyst&#8208;controlled aromatic halogenation is challenging under near&#8208;physiological conditions due to the lack of biocompatible catalysts, despite the potential of tyrosine bromination as an attractive biomolecular labeling technique. In this study, inspired by the bioorthogonal reactivity of cyclic olefins, we developed catalytic aromatic bromination via the transfer of a bromenium ion from olefins to aromatic substrates based on the in&#8208;situ generation of bromiranium ions as active species. Bifunctional cyclooctenes bearing a hydroxybenzyl group efficiently catalyzed the bromination of phenol derivatives, which was applicable in tyrosine modification. The substituent effects of the catalysts primarily affected the rate of the generation of bromiranium ions, which provided the kinetics enabling light&#8208;gated catalysis that could be activated in situ via the photochemical deprotection of the hydroxybenzyl group. Such olefin catalysis was compatible with aqueous conditions, enabling the bromination of peptides, and the Lewis&#8208;base catalysis of the olefins proceeded even under acidic conditions.

         <title>Pulsed Electrolysis Promotes CO2 reduction on Tin Oxide Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The performance of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is determined by multiple factors, including the optimization of catalysts and electrolyser, along with the electrolysis technique. Recently, pulsed electrolysis has been found to tailor the selectivity and prolong the stability of CO2RR on a variety of catalysts, with the most focus on Cu&#8208;based materials. The investigation of pulsed electrolysis on Sn&#8208;based materials remains at early stage. Herein we evaluate the CO2 reduction selectivity of tin oxide electrocatalyst under constant potential electrolysis (CPE) and pulsed potential electrolysis (PPE). Tin oxide achieves higher selectivity toward formate under PPE condition in comparison with CPE. Induced by applied potential, tin oxide catalyst undergoes obvious reconstruction and transform into the composite of Sn&#8208;SnO2 in the process of CO2 reduction under both PPE and CPE conditions. The high selectivity under PPE condition is ascribed to the formation of SnOx on the catalyst surface due to the applied anodic potential.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerating or Slowing: Fine Tuning the De&#8208;threading Kinetics of a T&#8208;Shaped Benzimidazolium Pumping Cassette</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial molecular machines (AMMs) rely on precise control of molecular motion, often enabled by mechanically interpenetrated architectures such as pseudorotaxanes. Here, we systematically investigated a library of [2]pseudorotaxanes formed by the combination of T&#8208;shaped benzimidazolium threads featuring variable stopper sizes and crown ether wheels (24C6, B24C6, and 23C6), to elucidate how structural parameters govern [2]pseudorotaxane stability and de&#8208;threading kinetics. Using ring&#8208;closing metathesis and subsequent hydrogenation, we synthesized ten neutral [2]pseudorotaxanes in high yields (76&#8211;87%). Kinetic studies in DMSO&#8208;d&#8326; at 338 K revealed that de&#8208;threading half&#8208;lives (t&#8321;/&#8322;) span five orders of magnitude, from 0.237 h (3a&#8315;, &#916;G&#8225; = 24.63 kcal/mol) to 436 h (5c&#8315;, &#916;G&#8225; = 31.87 kcal/mol). Notably, stopper enlargement and macrocycle rigidification (e.g., via B24C6) significantly suppressed de&#8208;threading rates; 4d&#8315;, bearing a benzylic phenyl stopper and B24C6, showed a &#916;G&#8225; of 29.04 kcal/mol and a t&#8321;/&#8322; of 168 h.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Artificial molecular machines (AMMs) rely on precise control of molecular motion, often enabled by mechanically interpenetrated architectures such as pseudorotaxanes. Here, we systematically investigated a library of [2]pseudorotaxanes formed by the combination of T-shaped benzimidazolium threads featuring variable stopper sizes and crown ether wheels (24C6, B24C6, and 23C6), to elucidate how structural parameters govern [2]pseudorotaxane stability and de-threading kinetics. Using ring-closing metathesis and subsequent hydrogenation, we synthesized ten neutral [2]pseudorotaxanes in high yields (76&#8211;87%). Kinetic studies in DMSO-d&#8326; at 338 K revealed that de-threading half-lives (t&#8321;/&#8322;) span five orders of magnitude, from 0.237 h (3a&#8315;, &#916;G&#8225; = 24.63 kcal/mol) to 436 h (5c&#8315;, &#916;G&#8225; = 31.87 kcal/mol). Notably, stopper enlargement and macrocycle rigidification (e.g., via B24C6) significantly suppressed de-threading rates; 4d&#8315;, bearing a benzylic phenyl stopper and B24C6, showed a &#916;G&#8225; of 29.04 kcal/mol and a t&#8321;/&#8322; of 168 h. Gas-phase modeling and NMR analyses further elucidated the roles of stopper geometry and host&#8211;guest interactions in modulating energy barriers. These findings provide design principles for the construction of pseudorotaxane-based modules, paving the way for programmable molecular pumps and advanced AMMs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solvent&#8208;free electrode fabrication (SEF) is a revolutionary advancement in the field of battery manufacturing, providing a compelling, solvent&#8208;free alternative to conventional slurry&#8208;based processing. SEF offers significant benefits, including reduced energy consumption resulting from the elimination of toxic solvents, solvent recovery steps, a lower environmental impact, overall cost reduction, and overcoming of binder migration, encountered during the fabrication of thicker electrodes. However, the practical application of SEF must overcome key challenges, such as achieving uniform particle distribution, ensuring strong electrode cohesion and adhesion, and scaling up to meet industrial production demands. This review provides a comprehensive assessment of the current landscape in dry electrode fabrication technologies, featuring advanced techniques such as dry pressing, spray dry deposition, and 3D printing. The fundamental chemistry of materials in addition to the mechanical, and electrochemical factors critical for optimising battery performance is elaborated with a clear focus on lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) from lab to manufacturing stage. Moreover, the article highlights significant recent advancements, identifies critical technical barriers, and outlines imperative research directions necessary to unleash the full potential of dry electrode manufacturing in the realm of sustainable energy storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Protein Photo&#8208;Stability Analysis Using SRCD in the Presence of Phospholipid SUVs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of lipid presence on the photostability of proteins was assessed using a synchrotron radiation circular dichroism UV&#8208;denaturation experiment at Diamond B23 beamline. The presence of SUVs preserves the native structure in proteins, particularly in those with a high helical content, suggesting that lipids may play a protective role against light&#8208;induced damage to proteins.








Abstract
The interaction between lipids and proteins impacts a multitude of cellular processes and may contribute to the onset of several pathologies and aging. Such processes are frequently linked to oxidative stress, whereby polyunsaturated fatty acids act as substrates for in vivo lipoxidation. The subsequent lipid peroxidation and/or isomerization is known to affect membrane organization, as well as to modify proteins and DNA, leading to functional alterations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the capacity of UV&#8208;denaturation experiments to induce lipid modification and to investigate the influence of lipid presence on the conformational stability of selected soluble model proteins. The high photon flux and brilliance of the incident beam light of Diamond Light Source B23 for sinchrotron radiation circular dichroism (SRCD) was used to induce protein denaturation. This was acheived by scanning 30 repeated consecutive SRCD spectra in the far&#8208;UV region that, being diagnostic of protein folding, enabled the estimation of the protein photostability. Our findings show that the presence of lipid vesicles (SUVs) significantly impacts the UV denaturation of proteins, preserving the native structure in proteins with a high helical content. This suggests that lipids may play a protective role against light&#8208;induced damage to proteins.

         <title>Spectroscopic Interrogation of Thiolate Hydrogen Bonding in the CO Sensor Protein CooA: Implications for Thiolate Ligation Stability and Cytochrome P450 Function</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heme proteins are important biomolecules. Proximal cysteine thiolate ligation is found both in heme enzymes such as cytochromes P450 (CYP) and regulatory proteins such as CooA, a CO sensor. The role of H&#8208;bonding to this cysteine is explored in CooA, including variants, and CYP119 using optical and paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies, which highlight key differences between these two heme systems.









Abstract
Cysteine (Cys) thiolate coordination in hemoproteins is a unique ligation motif found in enzymes and small molecule sensors. It is posited that divergence between these two functional classes of heme thiolate proteins is a result of distinct hydrogen bonding (H&#8208;bonding) interactions with the axial Cys(thiolate) ligand. To further test this hypothesis, we report a spectroscopic analysis of thiolate H&#8208;bonding in CooA, a carbon monoxide&#8208;sensing heme protein from Rhodospirillum rubrum that is known to switch between Cys75(thiolate) and histidine coordination upon reduction. We generated CooA variants with alterations at two residues, Asn42 and His77, which are postulated to influence H&#8208;bonding to Cys75 on the basis of an Fe(II) CooA structure. Using a combination of electronic absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopies, we identified several CooA variants that exhibit changes in thiolate donor strength and propose an H&#8208;bonding model in which Asn42 orients His77 for optimal H&#8208;bonding with Cys75 in Fe(III) CooA. Further, we spectroscopically characterize pyrrolidine&#8208;bound CYP119, a cytochrome P450, to mimic the first coordination sphere of Fe(III) CooA. Our data unequivocally show that CooA contains a stronger thiolate&#8208;Fe bond than the pyrrolidine&#8208;bound CYP119, suggesting that Cys(thiolate) H&#8208;bonding interactions in CooA are significantly weaker. These results support the hypothesis that thiolate H&#8208;bonding is a significant differentiator between the two classes of heme thiolate proteins.

         <title>Exploring the Impact of Phenanthroline&#8208;Based Glycoconjugated Ru(II) Polypyridyl Photosensitizers on Metastasis&#8208;Related Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel family of water&#8208;soluble, nontoxic, and phosphorescent N&#8208;glycosylated Ru(II) phenanthroline&#8208;based complexes are reported. They exhibit photoselectivity indexes ranging from 10 to 44 in PC&#8208;3 cells, while impacting cell migration and resistance to detachment after irradiation with blue light.








Abstract
Novel water&#8208;soluble, phosphorescent ruthenium(II) polypyridyl&#8208;glycoconjugates of general formula [Ru{N&#8208;(1,10&#8208;phenanthroline)}2{N&#8208;(1,10&#8208;phenanthrolin&#8208;5&#8208;yl)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glycopyranosylamine}][Cl]2 (glycopyranosyl&#160;=&#160;D&#8208;glucopyranosyl (1), D&#8208;mannopyranosyl (2), L&#8208;rhamnopyranosyl (3), L&#8208;xylopyranosyl (4), and 2,3,4&#8208;tri&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl&#8208;L&#8208;xylopyranosyl (5)) and corresponding aglycone [Ru{N&#8208;(1,10&#8208;phenanthroline)}2{N&#8208;(1,10&#8208;phenanthrolin&#8208;5&#8208;amine)}][Cl]2 (6) have been synthesized and fully characterized. Their stability and behavior in physiological media have been assessed using ultraviolet visible spectroscopy (UV&#8208;Vis) and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (&#185;H&#8208;NMR), revealing minor N&#8208;glycosidic cleavage and high photostability. The photocytotoxicity of the complexes has been evaluated in two different cancer (PC&#8208;3 and MCF&#8208;7) and one nontumorigenic (HFF&#8208;1) cell lines. While exhibiting no toxicity in the dark, some glycoconjugates achieve photoselectivity indexes of up to 40 upon blue&#8208;light irradiation. Remarkably, complexes 1&#8211;6 potently affect the metastatic phenotype of PC&#8208;3 cells, evidenced by the inhibition of migration in the wound healing assay and the increased resistance to trypsin detachment following photoactivation.

         <title>Chloride Double Perovskites Doped With Sb3+/Er3+ as Stable and Effective Luminescence Material in the Vis&#8208;NIR Region</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The luminescence properties of Sb3+/Er3+&#8208;doped chloride double perovskites Cs2Ag0.4Na0.6InCl6 have been investigated across 250&#8208;1600&#160;nm. Structural and spectroscopic analyses have been performed using XRD, SEM, Raman, XPS, and ToF&#8208;SIMS methods. Energy transfer from Sb3+ to Er3+ enables emission at 525, 552, 665, 805 and&#160;1540&#160;nm. The LED prototype has been &#8208; developed, demonstrating potential for optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
The luminescence properties of stable chloride double perovskites Cs2BIInCl6, where BI is 4 at.% Ag, 6 at.% Na, doped with Sb3+ and Er3+ &#160;were investigated for the first time in the 250&#8208;1600 nm region and revealed significant potential for advanced application. We employed XPS and ToF&#8208;SIMS for chemical analyses, while SEM, XRD, and Raman spectroscopy provided insights into the morphology, crystal structure, and vibrational characteristics of the samples. The crystal structures of Cs2Ag0.292Na0.708InCl6, Cs2Ag0.285Na0.715In0.971Er0.029Cl6, Cs2Ag0.16Na0.84In0.893Er0.017Sb0.09Cl6 were examined using single&#8208;crystal methods. The excited Sb3&#8314; ions emitted blue light at 450&#160;nm due to electronic absorption at sub&#8208;band gap levels, facilitating energy transfer to Er3&#8314; ions. Notably, the Er3&#8314; emitted radiation at 1540&#160;nm, a wavelength particularly useful for optical communication applications. Additionally, emissions at 525&#160;nm, 552&#160;nm, 665&#160;nm, and 805&#160;nm were observed, corresponding to f&#8208;f transitions of Er3&#8314; ions. These compelling results were supported with calculations based on the Modified Crystal Field Theory, explaining the effects of varying concentrations of Sb3&#8314; and Er3&#8314; on the crystal structure and luminescent properties. By using the synthesized materials, we successfully developed an LED prototype that utilized a UV chip (320&#160;nm) combined with the Cs2Ag0.4Na0.6In0.9Er0.01Sb0.09Cl6 powder as a stable and effective luminophore for possible application in optoelectronics.

         <title>Engineering of the Thiamine Diphosphate&#8208;Dependent JanthE for the Synthesis of Tertiary Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of chiral tertiary alcohols is in high demand. Here we investigate in detail the aldehyde&#8211;ketone cross&#8208;coupling reactions catalyzed by the promising thiamine diphosphate&#8208;dependent lyase JanthE. Focusing on both reaction parameters and engineering, we rationally develop JanthE to improve its applicability and demonstrate its evolvability and versatility for the enantioselective synthesis of sterically hindered tertiary alcohols.








Abstract
The development of (bio)catalytic methods to chiral tertiary alcohols is in demand, yet the enantioselective synthesis of tertiary alcohols with sterically hindered moieties is problematic. JanthE is a novel thiamine diphosphate&#8208;dependent enzyme that catalyzes aldehyde&#8208;ketone cross&#8208;coupling reactions with a wide range of donor and acceptor substrates. However, product formation is low and precludes large&#8208;scale production. We investigated the conversion of 2&#8208;oxobutanoate and the bulky ketone phenoxy&#8208;2&#8208;propanone to the product 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8208;phenoxypentan&#8208;3&#8208;one as a model reaction for the synthetic capabilities of JanthE. As the reaction design did not significantly improve the yield, we proceeded to rational protein engineering. Docking experiments identified V121, Y268, P293, Y297, and K567 in the active site as important residues for catalysis. Remarkably, the single&#8208;point variant JanthE K567S led to a fivefold increase in product formation (90% ee) compared to the wild type enzyme (93% ee). The reaction was performed at preparative scale proving the direct possibility of application. Additionally, when the reaction was extended to longer 2&#8208;oxopentanoate, the double variant Y297P_K567S showed a 5&#8208;fold increase in product formation compared to the wild type. Our results demonstrate the evolvability and versatility of JanthE for the enantioselective synthesis of sterically hindered tertiary alcohols.

         <title>Non&#8208;C2&#8208;Symmetric Complexant for Minor Actinide Separation of Actinides from Lanthanides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Since initial employment in liquid&#8211;liquid separations for minor actinides (An) from lanthanides (Ln) contained within used nuclear fuel, all previously reported examples of bis&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazinylpyridine (BTP) complexants have been C2 symmetric about the pyridine N axis. Symmetry is postulated to limit solvent access to the polar surface area of complexant topography potentially resulting in low solubility in nonpolar diluents. In this work the unsymmetric BTP, 3&#8208;(6&#8208;(5,6&#8208;bis(3&#8208;butoxyphenyl)&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;5,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazine, a polar molecule, was found to have good solubility in 1&#8208;octanol:kerosene, rapid complexation, high chemoselectivity for 241Am3+ over 154&#8211;152Eu3+, efficient decomplexation without additives, and was recyclable through multiple extractions. Liquid&#8211;liquid extraction, decomplexation, spectroscopic, and DFT calculations are presented.








Abstract
Advancements in the separation of the minor actinides (An) from the neutron&#8208;poisoning post fission lanthanides (Ln) via the partitioning and transmutation strategy are vital toward closure of the nuclear fuel cycle, decreasing dependence on fossil fuels, and minimizing the environmental impact of energy production. Recent advancements in complexant&#8208;based separations strategies have realized substantive gains in ease of synthetic access, process&#8208;relevant diluent solubility, in addition to stability in strongly acidic environments. As purposeful exploration of chemoselective chelating agents moves forward, rapid, selective, and reversible actinide binding are at the forefront. In this work, the utility of a non&#8208;C2&#8208;symmetric, bis&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazinylpyridine (BTP)&#8208;type complexant for the selective extraction of 241Am3+ over 154&#8211;152Eu3+ from simulated high&#8208;level waste is reported. High separation factors (SFs) in 1&#8208;octanol:kerosene 50:50 (v/v), equilibration within 15 minutes of contact time, decomplexation with dilute acid only, and recyclability of a discrete complexant for additional extractions were achieved. Separations, spectroscopic, and DFT calculation data supporting the observed experimental results are disclosed herein.

Liquid&#8211;liquid extraction, decomplexation, spectroscopic, and DFT calculations are presented.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advancements in the separation of the minor actinides (An) from the neutron-poisoning post fission lanthanides (Ln) via the partitioning and transmutation strategy are vital toward closure of the nuclear fuel cycle, decreasing dependence on fossil fuels, and minimizing the environmental impact of energy production. Recent advancements in complexant-based separations strategies have realized substantive gains in ease of synthetic access, process-relevant diluent solubility, in addition to stability in strongly acidic environments. As purposeful exploration of chemoselective chelating agents moves forward, rapid, selective, and reversible actinide binding are at the forefront. In this work, the utility of a non-&lt;i&gt;C2&lt;/i&gt;-symmetric, bis-1,2,4-triazinylpyridine (BTP)-type complexant for the selective extraction of &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; over &lt;sup&gt;154&#8211;152&lt;/sup&gt;Eu&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; from simulated high-level waste is reported. High separation factors (&lt;i&gt;SFs&lt;/i&gt;) in 1-octanol:kerosene 50:50 (&lt;i&gt;v/v&lt;/i&gt;), equilibration within 15 minutes of contact time, decomplexation with dilute acid only, and recyclability of a discrete complexant for additional extractions were achieved. Separations, spectroscopic, and DFT calculation data supporting the observed experimental results are disclosed herein.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ionic liquid&#8208;modified resorcinol formaldehyde resins: synthesis and applications to methylene blue removal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two new imidazolium&#8208;functionalized resorcinol&#8208;formaldehyde resins RFs were synthesized, using butyl&#8208;methyl imidazolium resorcinate [C1C4Im][Res] as a new precursor or using a post&#8208;functionalization method. During its synthesis, [C1C4Im][Res] spontenaously co&#8208;crystallizes with resorcinol (in a 1 : 1 stoechiometry): the crystal structure shows H&#8208;bonds between resorcinol and resorcinate, and rarely observed &#960;+&#8208;&#960;&#8208; and C&#8208;H&#8208;&#960; interactions between imidazolium ring and resorcinate. New RFs presented substantial decreases of the band gap compared to unmodified RF (from 2.0 eV to 1.72 eV). The use of [C1C4Im][Res] significantly improves particle size uniformity compared to unmodified RF, whereas the post&#8208;functionalization method partially degrades their structure. As RF, the two new resins efficiently catalyse the photodegradation of the methylene blue cation, and the post&#8208;functionalised resin has excellent adsorption properties for this dye.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Insights into Direct Electron Transfer Between FDX1 and Elesclomol&#8208;Cu2+ complex in Cuproptosis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper&#8208;induced cell death, known as cuproptosis, is distinct from other forms of apoptosis. Previous studies have proposed Elesclomol (ES) as a potent cuproptosis inducer, with the mitochondrial ferredoxin protein FDX1 postulated as its primary target. However, the mechanistic details of electron transfer (ET) between Elesclomol&#8208;Cu2+ (ES&#8208;Cu2+) and FDX1 remain elusive, particularly lacking direct spectroscopic evidence. Here, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was employed to characterize the direct ET process between FDX1 and ES&#8208;Cu2+ complexes. Comprehensive low&#8208;temperature EPR measurements validated the efficient ET from reduced FDX1 (FDX1red) to oxidized ES&#8208;Cu2+ complex both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, ES&#8208;Cu2+ complex exhibited a greater propensity for accepting electrons from FDX1 compared to free copper ions (Cu2+), demonstrating the high efficiency of ES&#8208;Cu2+ as a primary electron scavenger for FDX1 in cells. In addition, EPR power saturation experiments and molecular docking analysis indicated that FDX1 has a much higher binding affinity for ES&#8208;Cu2+ than its homologue FDX2, providing crucial insights into the functional specificity between FDX1 and FDX2. This work advances our understanding of ET processes in cuproptosis and underscores the significant potential of EPR spectroscopy in the study of important redox events in cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Proton Reaction Chemistry of Aqueous Zn&#8211;MnO2 Battery by Phosphate Proton Reservoir</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous rechargeable Zn&#8211;MnO&#8322; batteries have emerged as promising candidates for grid&#8208;scale energy storage due to their low cost, high safety, natural abundance, and high working potential. However, their widespread application is hindered by rapidly capacity degradation and sluggish reaction kinetics. In this study, we introduce Zn&#8323;(PO&#8324;)&#8322;&#183;4H&#8322;O (ZPH) as a proton reservoir to significantly enhance the electrochemical performance of MnO&#8322; by optimizing proton reaction chemistry. Specifically, ZPH stores protons during charging and releases them during discharging, creating a localized H&#8314;&#8208;rich environment that facilitates proton intercalation of Mn&#8308;&#8314;/Mn3&#8314; and the two&#8208;electron transfer reaction of Mn&#8308;+/Mn&#178;&#8314;. Leveraging the proton storage capability of ZPH, the layered MnO&#8322; cathode demonstrates exceptional rate performance (219.2 mA h g&#8722;&#185; at 3 A g&#8722;&#185;), high specific capacity (347.3 mA h g&#8722;&#185; at 0.1 A g&#8722;&#185;), and remarkable cycling performance (1500 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;&#185;). This work provides a scalable and electrolyte&#8208;compatible pathway to optimize proton&#8208;involved reaction dynamics in aqueous Zn&#8211;MnO&#8322; batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;mediated IL&#8208;8 binding to heparan sulfate evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heparan sulfate (HS) interactions with interleukin 8 (IL&#8208;8) are crucial for immune system response. The structural features of the HS and the environmental entities, such as metal ions, can regulate these interactions. However, it is challenging to evaluate the effect of each parameter on the interactions because of low accessibility to well&#8208;defined saccharides and the lack of characteristic features to be determined by analytical tools. We evaluated the effect of the HS structural features on IL&#8208;8 binding affinity utilizing electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. We showed that the metal Ions Ca2+ and Mg2+ dissimilarly mediate the interactions of HS and IL&#8208;8 in structure structure&#8208;dependent manner of the HS. We showed that in all glycans, a positive synergistic effect on IL&#8208;8 binding was observed. For several glycans, the presence of ions resulted in a dramatic increase in the affinity to IL&#8208;8, while for other glycans, a milder effect was observed. This demonstrated that both structural motifs and environmental features are crucial for maintaining the interactions between the HS and IL&#8208;8.</dc:description>

         <title>Cover Feature: Photoswitching Lanthanoid Luminescence With Diazocines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 32, June 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The luminescence of trivalent terbium, europium and ytterbium can be reversibly photomodulated by using the photoswitch diazocine. The image illustrates one of the contributing mechanisms, competitive absorption, in which the diazocine dynamically limits the amount of energy available for the luminescence process. Further contributing mechanisms are the depopulation of the excited state of the lanthanoid and reabsorption after emission. More information can be found in the Research Article by N. Winterholler and E. Kreidt (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202500397).

         <title>Fused Nitrogen Bridgehead N,O&#8208;Acetals as Versatile Scaffolds: Synthetic Strategies, Mechanism and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 32, June 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fused nitrogen&#8208;bridgehead N,O&#8208;acetals receive specific emphasis as pivotal scaffolds due to their significant role in the bioactivity of medicinally relevant molecules. Significant approaches have been reported on their role as key synthetic building blocks/motifs in the construction of complex organic molecules and their utility as chiral auxiliaries in the enantioselective synthesis of natural products and synthetic compound libraries. This study will give new insights into the synthetic strategies, as well as into the mechanism and applications of such interesting nitrogen bridgehead fused N,O&#8208;bicycle acetals, and especially for the hydropyrrolo&#8208;oxazole/&#8208;oxazine derivatives.








Abstract
Fused Bicyclic N,O&#8208;acetals, are prominently present in several natural products and constitute a versatile family of compounds, with nitrogen&#8208;bridgehead fused N,O&#8208;bicyclic derivatives receiving specific emphasis as pivotal scaffolds due to their significant role in the bioactivity of medicinally relevant molecules. Hence, significant advancements in their applications in Organic Synthesis have been extensively documented in the literature, highlighting their role as key synthetic building blocks/motifs in the construction of complex organic molecules and their utility as chiral auxiliaries in the enantioselective synthesis of natural products and synthetic compound libraries. Nonetheless, while these developments have been well&#8208;explored, our review offers a new perspective by consolidating and critically evaluating various synthetic strategies for accessing the nitrogen&#8208;bridgehead fused N,O&#8208;acetal frameworks (such as hydropyrrolo&#8208;oxazole and oxazine frameworks) providing new insights into their mechanistic approaches and applications, and demonstrating their full potential in advanced synthetic chemistry. These methodologies are systematically covered in terms of their mechanistic pathways, synthetic efficiency, and practical applications, providing an integrated understanding of their contribution to the field of Organic Synthesis.

ML accelerates sustainable polymer development by replacing resource&#8208;extensive trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methods with efficient predictive modeling for catalyst discovery, polymer property optimization and new material design.








Abstract
Sustainable polymers from renewable resources have been gaining importance due to their recyclability and reduced environmental impact. However, their development through conventional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methods remains inefficient and resource&#8208;intensive. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool in polymer science, enabling rapid prediction, and discovery of new chemicals and materials. In this review, we examine emerging trends in ML applications for sustainable polymer development, focusing on catalyst discovery, property optimization, and new polymer design. We analyze unique challenges in applying ML to sustainable polymers and evaluate proposed solutions, providing insights for future development in this rapidly evolving field.

POMs are gaining attention in metal nanocluster synthesis for their ability to impart unique structural and functional roles. This review highlights recent advances in POM&#8211;metal nanocluster hybrids, categorized as follows: (a) hybrids of POMs and metal nanoclusters stabilized by organic ligands, (b) metal nanoclusters stabilized by POMs as ligands, and (c) solid&#8208;state synthesis of metal nanoclusters using POM&#8208;defined scaffolds.








Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are structurally well&#8208;defined anionic metal&#8211;oxo clusters with diverse structural forms and distinctive physicochemical properties, including acidity/basicity, redox activity, and optical behavior. Over the past two decades, POMs have garnered increasing attention in metal nanocluster synthesis owing to their ability to impart unique structural and functional characteristics to these compounds. Initially, research in this field primarily focused on hybrid materials composed of POMs and metal nanoclusters stabilized by organic ligands. However, more recently, studies have demonstrated that POMs can themselves act as effective stabilizing ligands for the synthesis of atomically precise metal nanoclusters. These POM&#8208;stabilized metal nanoclusters exhibit synergistic and cooperative properties of metal nanocluster and POM components, enabling novel applications in fields such as catalysis, photochemistry, sensing, and electrochemistry. Notably, recent investigations into POM&#8211;metal nanocluster hybrids have demonstrated their potential as atomically precise counterparts to metal nanoparticle catalysts supported on bulk metal oxides, exhibiting the unique cooperative catalysis. This review provides a concise overview of POM&#8210;metal nanocluster hybrids, with an emphasis on recent advancements in synthetic methodologies, properties, and applications. Additionally, solid&#8208;state synthetic strategies leveraging the rigid structures and redox properties of POMs for the controlled formation of metal nanoclusters are discussed.

Gas&#8208;responsive membranes possess tunable pores and surface properties, offering great potential in the field of smart separation. This review provides a detailed overview of their fabrication methods and applications in separation, along with our perspectives on current challenges and future prospects.








Abstract
Membrane separation technology is one of the most important techniques in modern separation science. To understand the self&#8208;regulation mechanisms of cell membranes and mimic their working principles, a plethora of artificial membranes with responsive abilities to external stimuli have been engineered and prepared, whose smart sieving functions continue to attract attention and are applied in various fields. Among all the known stimuli, gas as a new trigger mode exhibits certain biocompatibility and offer irreplaceable advantages compared to other stimuli, such as cleanliness, ease&#8208;of&#8208;handling, and nondestructive, which make gas&#8208;responsive membranes as one of the most promising, smart separation materials. In this review, we summarize recent breakthroughs in the development of gas&#8208;responsive membranes, outline the novel strategies on membrane fabrication, and highlight their advanced applications in controlled cargo release, size&#8208;/charge&#8208;based substance separation, oil&#8208;water separation, and self&#8208;cleaning. We also outlook the perspectives on the potential research directions and opportunities in the future.

         <title>Biodegradable Gel Blends with Enhanced Sensing Capabilities: SIO&#8322;&#8208;Based Innovations for Sustainable and Eco&#8208;Friendly Packaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 32, June 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biodegradable gelatin&#8208;based gel blends reinforced with SiO&#8322; and nanoclay exhibit enhanced mechanical strength, thermal stability, and ion&#8208;mediated structural integrity. These metal&#8208;free, eco&#8208;friendly materials open new opportunities for sustainable packaging.








Abstract
Biopolymer blends (GGs) derived from renewable plant or animal&#8208;based raw materials, hold significant potential for competing in the packaging industry by offering environmentally biodegradable and bioresorbable alternatives. One of the main challenges lies in optimizing the mechanical properties to enhance stress transfer between active additives and the gelatin matrices reinforced with modified SiO&#8322; compounds. In this study, a 5 &#176;C increase in the glass transition temperature and a fourfold improvement in tensile strength (reaching 12&#160;MPa) were achieved by incorporating hydrophilic SiO&#8322; nanoclay. Ion distribution maps visualized the interactions between silicon derivatives and polypeptide domains within the gel matrix, revealing increased stability attributed to ions such as Si+, SiO+, SiH+, and SiHO+. The absence of heavy metals in the blends underscores their potential as environmentally friendly and sustainable packaging solutions, with promising applications in sectors such as medical packaging.

         <title>Tailored Self&#8208;Assembled Biomimetic Nanofibers for Light&#8208;Driven &#946;&#8208;lactam Antibiotics Degradation in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 32, June 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an artificial biomimetic micellar system that integrates photothermal agents and ionic copper catalytic sites with spatially controlled positioning on a fiber&#8208;like crystalline scaffold via a crystal&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly method. Tailored photothermal&#8208;assisted antibiotic degradation (PAD) nanofibers achieve efficient &#946;&#8208;lactam degradation in deionized water, offering a sustainable solution for wastewater treatment and environmental remediation.








Abstract
The overuse of antibiotics in China and the resulting rise in antibiotic resistance pose an urgent need for effective antibiotic degradation in water. Developing artificial systems that mimic the catalytic efficiency of natural photoactive enzymes for this purpose remains a critical challenge. Despite decades of research, there is a notable scarcity of precisely designed scaffolds that can replicate the structural and functional efficiency of natural enzymes for waterborne antibiotic degradation, particularly at the nano&#8208; to micrometer scale. In this study, we present a core&#8208;corona type fiber&#8208;like micellar system designed for photothermal&#8208;assisted &#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotic degradation (PAD) in water. This system integrates photothermal molecular chromophores (zinc porphyrin) and ionic copper degradation catalysts in close proximity within grafted solvophilic coronal chains on the surface of fiber&#8208;like crystalline scaffold. By employing a living crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA) strategy, we fine&#8208;tune the composition, dimensions, and antibiotic degradation performance of the PAD nanofibers. The tailored colloidal stable PAD nanofibers achieve a penicillin G degradation rate of 0.35 min&#8722;1 per micromole of copper under simulated sunlight irradiation (AM 1.5) in deionized water, offering a promising platform for sustainable environmental remediation.

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Based Design of Metallocene Catalysts for Controlled Olefin Copolymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 32, June 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To design catalysts for ethylene/hexene copolymerization, a virtual screening scheme combining predictive models with a genetic algorithm was proposed. Chemically intuitive descriptors obtained from mechanism analysis improve the generalizability of models, effectively predicting catalysts with new core structures not included in the fitting set. This scheme is used to design new zirconocene catalysts with desired properties and diverse core structures.








Abstract
Polyolefins are versatile materials for various purposes, but their functionality should be fine&#8208;tuned for target applications including the mitigation of adverse environmental impacts. Producing such polymers with desired properties requires catalysts that can control polymerization at an atomistic level. However, complex reaction mechanisms and very limited experimental data make it difficult to design new efficient catalysts using conventional computational and data&#8208;driven approaches. Here, we present a pragmatic strategy based on data&#8208;efficient predictive models combined with a genetic algorithm to design new catalysts for controlled ethylene/hexene copolymerization. By deriving the chemically intuitive descriptors from the mechanistic analysis of the polymerization, we achieved the promising predictive models with small data applicable to various core structures and different experimental conditions, respectively. We screened catalysts through a virtual screening scheme combining a genetic algorithm and predictive models using chemically intuitive descriptors and considered their synthesizability through the manual inspections of experts. As a result, we successfully designed nine catalysts with desired comonomer ratios and diverse core structures.

         <title>Click&#8208;Functionalized Cyanine Fluorogenic Dimers for Improved Detection of GPCRs: Application to Imaging of ApelinR in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 32, June 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A click&#8208;mediated functionalization of a cyanine 5.5 bearing a terminal alkyne gave a rapid access to a library of ten new cyanine dyes and their corresponding dimers. A structure&#8208;interaction relationship study led to the identification of an optimal dimer which was conjugated to the apelin&#8208;17 ligand and enabled imaging of ApelinR under no&#8208;wash conditions.








Abstract
Fluorogenic dimers enable background&#8208;free imaging of biological targets under wash&#8208;free conditions owing to a strong fluorescence enhancement in the apolar cell microenvironment. However, it is crucial that the imaging probe interacts solely with the target receptor to avoid nonspecific interactions and ensure detection with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. Herein, we describe a convenient and rapid approach for the synthesis of various functionalized cyanine dyes by click chemistry allowing the fine&#8208;tuning of the physicochemical and fluorogenic properties of the dimers. A structure&#8208;interaction relationship study was conducted for the fluorogenic dimers in the presence of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and liposomes as models of serum proteins and cell membranes. We identified d&#9472;Cy&#9472;E which combined the lowest nonspecific interactions with the optimal fluorescence turn&#8208;on properties. By conjugating d&#9472;Cy&#9472;E to a peptide ligand of the apelin GPCR, we developed Ap&#9472;d&#9472;Cy&#9472;E, the first fluorescent turn&#8208;on probe for the background&#8208;free imaging of this receptor in living cells.

         <title>Photoswitching Lanthanoid Luminescence With Diazocines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 32, June 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photomodulation of lanthanoid luminescence promises new layers of complexity for diverse applications. We herein present a new strategy for the manipulation of luminescence intensities and lifetimes based on diazocine photoswitches. This strategy is particularly well suited for multiplexing and does not require covalent connection of individual photoactive components.








Abstract
The unique photophysical properties of the lanthanoids provide the core functionality for various high&#8208;tech applications, including optoelectronic materials, lasers, anti&#8208;counterfeiting dyes, or tools for biological sciences. The combination of these luminophores with photoswitches has the potential to make them remote controllable and adds new layers of complexity to their applications. We herein report that such a photomodulation of EuIII, TbIII, and YbIII luminescence is possible with the aid of diazocine photoswitches. The new approach, which does not require covalent connection of the photoswitch and antenna ligand, is by design suitable for multiplexing applications and allows for a drastic and reversible modulation of the overall luminescence intensity and luminescence lifetimes. Photophysical studies under bypassing of the antenna ligand and at 77 K gave insights into the mechanism of the effect.

         <title>Localized Breakdown of the Niobium Anodic Oxide Film by Bromides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 32, June 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bromide&#8208;induced localized breakdown of niobium anodic oxide films&#160;depends on the bromide concentration and potential scan rate. Related experimental relationships agree with the predictions of a point defect model (PDM) under certain conditions. Within the same potential region, niobium maintains passivity in the more aggressive chloride media. PDM is used to explain the bromide&#8208;induced localized corrosion of niobium






.

Abstract
The growth of the anodic oxide passive film on Nb and its stability were studied in aqueous bromide media. Potentiodynamic polarization up to 12 VSCE showed that passive Nb loses its stability resulting in either metastable or stable pitting corrosion depending on the bromide concentration and the potential scan rate. On the contrary, Nb remains passive in the more aggressive chloride media where most passive metals and alloys are often susceptible to localized breakdown. This unusual bromide&#8208;induced localized breakdown of passive Nb occurs for bromide concentrations higher than 0.25&#160;M at a critical breakdown potential (Eb). Stable active dissolution in pits was observed at potentials higher than Eb. &#932;&#959; get an insight into the physicochemical processes responsible for the susceptibility of Nb to the bromide&#8208;induced localized corrosion, the oxide growth and its breakdown are discussed in terms of a point defect model (PDM). Experimental relationships between Eb and either the bromide activity or the potential scan rate agree with the PDM predictions. The bromide&#8208;induced localized breakdown of passive Nb seems to be associated with the absorption of bromides preferably on lattice anion vacancies at the oxide|electrolyte interface leading through a series of processes to vacancy condensation at the Nb|oxide interface.

         <title>Tandem ADMET and CAMMP to Access Degradable Thermosets and Multiblock Copolymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 32, June 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diene small molecule monomers, serving as monomers, are polymerized via ADMET to produce macromonomers with varying degrees of polymerization. By judiciously selecting copolymerizable cycloolefin monomers, this approach enables the one&#8208;pot synthesis of highly degradable thermosetting materials and multiblock copolymers that exhibit excellent material properties.








Abstract
The development of degradable polymers and multiblock copolymeric (MBCP) compatibilizers represents an appealing strategy to address ever&#8208;growing concerns for treating waste plastics of traditional chemical degradation or mechanical recycling. Although recent advancements in cyclic&#8211;acyclic monomers metathesis polymerization (CAMMP) and tandem olefin metathesis polymerization (TOMP) have recently been reported to produce degradable polymers and MBCPs via copolymerization of cyclic monomers with acyclic diene comonomers, there have been no reports of preparing high&#8208;performance thermosetting materials and multiblock copolymers within the same polymerization system solely through the selection of cycloolefin monomers. To achieve this objective, a TOMP system has been designed that combines acyclic diene metathesis (ADMET) polymerization of diene comonomers followed by CAMMP with cyclic olefin monomers (dicyclopentadiene DCPD or cyclooctene COE). The selection of different cyclic olefin monomers provided access to degradable cross&#8208;linked thermosets and multiblock copolymers. Notably, this one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step process is highly efficient and requires the addition of only one metathesis catalyst.

         <title>Dinitrogen Splitting without Barrier or Visible Light&#8208;Driven: Reactions of Vanadium Trimers and Dimers with Dinitrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 32, June 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Striking differences between the reactivity of vanadium atoms, dimers, and trimer clusters were revealed by matrix isolation experiments. Vanadium atoms only form weakly bound N2 complexes, but the V3 cluster splits the NN triple bond to give a V3N2 cluster. The V2 dimer requires visible light irradiation to form two isomeric V2N2 clusters with and without V&#9472;V bond. The results demonstrate the potential of clusters for N2 conversion.








Abstract
The reaction of V atoms and small clusters with dinitrogen has been investigated by matrix isolation in solid Ne and by complementary quantum chemical calculations. The experiments disclose striking differences between the reactivity of V atoms, dimers, and trimers toward dinitrogen. Whereas V atoms react only by formation of complexes, both V2 and V3 react by cleavage of the N2 triple bond to form nitride clusters. Whereas V3 reacts immediately at the conditions of matrix deposition, the reaction of V2 requires activation by irradiation with visible light. There is evidence for two isomers of V2N2, a planar one with a 5Au electronic term and a long V&#9472;V distance, and a folded one with a 1A1 term and a short V&#9472;V distance. Furthermore, there are also complexes of V2 and V3 with N2 that contain activated N2 units.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reaction of V atoms and small clusters with dinitrogen has been investigated by matrix isolation in solid Ne and by complementary quantum chemical calculations. The experiments disclose striking differences between the reactivity of V atoms, dimers, and trimers toward dinitrogen. Whereas V atoms react only by formation of complexes, both V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; react by cleavage of the N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; triple bond to form nitride clusters. Whereas V&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; reacts immediately at the conditions of matrix deposition, the reaction of V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; requires activation by irradiation with visible light. There is evidence for two isomers of V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a planar one with a &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; electronic term and a long V&#9472;V distance, and a folded one with a &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; term and a short V&#9472;V distance. Furthermore, there are also complexes of V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that contain activated N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; units.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Differentiating Ligand Tailoring and Cation Incorporation as Strategies for Tuning Heterobimetallic Cerium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 32, June 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influences of ligand structure and incorporation of secondary Lewis acidic cations on high coordination number cerium centers have been studied, revealing unique roles for ligands and secondary cations in driving structural and electronic tunability. Tuning of redox&#8208;active complexes by secondary cations is an important strategy commonly applied to low coordination number metal centers but one that is underexplored for heavier metals like lanthanides (including cerium) and actinides.








Abstract
Tuning of redox&#8208;active complexes featuring metals with high coordination numbers by incorporation of secondary redox&#8208;inactive cations has received far less attention than it deserves. Here, appending moderate steric bulk to a tripodal ligand framework has been tested for its influence on secondary&#8208;cation&#8208;driven structural and electrochemical tuning of cerium, a lanthanide that tends to adopt high coordination numbers. A quasi&#8208;C3&#8208;symmetric cerium(III) complex denoted [Ce] has been prepared that features pendant benzyloxy groups, and this work demonstrates that this species offers a site capable of binding single Na+ or Ca2+ ions. Electrochemical and UV&#8208;visible spectroscopic studies reveal equilibrium binding affinity of [Ce] for Na+ in acetonitrile solvent, contrasting with tight binding of all cations in all other previously studied systems of this type. The modulated cation binding can be attributed to the bulky benzyloxy groups, which impact the thermodynamics of cation binding but do not impede the formation of cerium centers with coordination number 8 upon binding of either Na+ or Ca2+. The Ce(IV/III) reduction potential was found to be tunable under the equilibrium binding conditions, highlighting the potentially significant role that controlled structural changes can play in modulating the solution properties of heterobimetallic complexes.

         <dc:description>
At physiological temperature in NaCl solutions, the potential drug [VIVO(acetylacetonato)2] reacts with lysozyme forming mixed&#8208;valence polyoxidovanadates which covalently bind to the protein surface.








Abstract
Crystals of the model protein lysozyme were grown and soaked with the potential drug VIVO(acetylacetonato)2 at 37&#176;C. X&#8208;ray diffraction and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) data collected at this temperature reveal that mixed&#8208;valence cage&#8208;like polyoxidovanadate clusters are formed and covalently bind protein residue side chains at physiological temperature.

         <title>From C&#9472;H Bond Insertion to Hydrogen Atom Transfer: Tuning the Reaction Mechanisms of Methane Activation by the Oxidation of Ta2+</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 32, June 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a combined experimental and theoretical study, it is observed that the continued oxidation from Ta2+ to Ta2Ox+ (with x&#160;=&#160;1 &#8211; 6) changes the reactivity with methane from a typical metallic to a typical oxidic behavior. While the bridging motifs in Ta2O2+ enable the dehydrogenation of CH4, the spin density on oxygen atoms in Ta2O5+ facilitates a HAT reaction.








Abstract
The activation of methane under mild conditions is a challenging but rewarding goal; the underlying key parameters, however, remain elusive. In this study on isolated tantalum Ta2+ compounds exposed to methane in a ring&#8208;electrode ion trap, strong changes in the reactivity are observed depending on the compound's degree of oxidation. While the general reaction behavior is presented for species ranging from Ta2+ to Ta2O6+ based on experimental kinetic studies, we focus in more detail on the dehydrogenation reactions occurring on Ta2O2+ and the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) on Ta2O5+, for which density functional theory calculations were performed. In the first part, we elucidate the role of Ta&#8211;C&#8211;Ta bridging motifs in product structures as driving forces for the dehydrogenation of methane on Ta2O2+; in the second part, we investigate the origins of the HAT &#8211; a hitherto unknown reaction scheme for binary tantalum oxides. For the latter, we show that the reactivity originates from the spin density on oxygen atoms, which is a typical characteristic of the reaction on other metal oxides. This reflects a change in the reactivity from oxidized metallic systems to metal oxides and demonstrates that chemical modifications of tantalum compounds can achieve different methane activation schemes.

         <title>Ni(OH)x/Ni&#8208;Catalyzed In Situ Hydrogenation and Ethanol Ethoxylation of 2&#8208;Methylfuran for Renewable Biofuel Co&#8208;Upgrading</title>

Abstract
Bioethanol and furanics are currently prevailing additives to fossil&#8208;based transportation fuels. With the objective to lift the longstanding limitations of these biofuel additives, this work reports for the first time the synthesis of 2&#8208;ethoxy&#8208;2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran (2&#8208;EO&#8208;2&#8208;MTHF) as a co&#8208;upgraded fuel by reacting ethanol with 2&#8208;methylfuran (2&#8208;MF). The formation of 2&#8208;EO&#8208;2&#8208;MTHF is achieved through ethanol ethoxylation of 2&#8208;MF, enabled by a reverse Ni(OH)x/Ni catalyst under hydrogen pressure. Nickel hydroxide species over the Ni nanoparticles play a crucial role in activating ethanol and polarizing the partially hydrogenated dihydrofuran intermediates, favorably steering the reaction selectively toward the ethoxylation product. The reaction conditions, including pressure and temperature, are systematically optimized to enhance the yield of 2&#8208;EO&#8208;2&#8208;MTHF, and provide a means to beneficially tune the fuel compositions consisting mainly of 2&#8208;EO&#8208;2&#8208;MTHF and 2&#8208;MTHF, both are high energy density molecules. Importantly, the reverse Ni(OH)x&#8208;Ni catalyst allows a one&#8208;pot process to accomplish consecutive partial hydrogenation of 2&#8208;MF and ethanol ethoxylation. This work provides a practical strategy for upgrading biomass&#8208;derived polar primary fuel molecules into more versatile fuels and chemicals.

         <title>p&#8208;&#960; Conjugate Triggered Red Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence from Single Benzene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 32, June 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing the p&#8208;&#960; conjugation, single benzene derivatives, which are uniquely different from conventional extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems, display red/NIR RTP under ambient condition. One of the phosphors shows maximum RTP peak at 585&#160;nm, along with shoulder peaks at 545&#160;nm, 635&#160;nm, and 700&#160;nm. This architecture minimizes the requirement for red/NIR phosphors to a single benzene ring.








Abstract
Benzene is the simplest and the most basic building block for the construction of &#960; conjugated systems, which are widely used in various fields from fluorescent (FL) dyes to optoelectronic displays. However, achieving the red room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from single benzene is still challenging. Utilizing the p&#8208;&#960; conjugation, herein, we report a single benzene&#8208;based push&#8208;pull system with red RTP under ambient condition. One of the phosphors shows maximum RTP peak at 585&#160;nm, along with shoulder peaks at 545&#160;nm, 635&#160;nm, and 700&#160;nm. This architecture is uniquely separate from conventional extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems and minimizes the requirement for red/near&#8208;infrared (NIR) phosphors to a single benzene ring.

         <title>Protonation&#8208;Induced Reversible Switching of Electronic Delocalization in a Linear Ru&#8211;Ru&#8211;Ru Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 32, June 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a molecular switch based on protonation&#8208;induced electron transfer reactions, in which electron configuration of 13+ can be switched between LRuII+0.5&#8208;NC&#8208;RuII&#8208;CN&#8208;RuII+0.5L and HLRuII&#8208;NC&#8208;RuIII&#8208;CN&#8208; RuIILH.








Abstract
In this work, we report the first example of a molecular switch between electronic delocalization and electronic localization in cyanidometal&#8208;bridged trinuclear mixed&#8208;valence (MV) complex controlled by a protonation reaction. A MV complex with the terminal 2,3&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)pyridine (L) ligand which has a higher proton&#8208;accepting character, LRuIII&#8208;NC&#8208;RuII&#8208;CN&#8208;RuIIL (13+) was synthesized and well characterized. The investigations indicate that the interaction between the two terminal Ru centers of 13+ is so strong that it is fully delocalized and can be described as LRuII+0.5&#8208;NC&#8208;RuII&#8208;CN&#8208;RuII+0.5L. Most interestingly, 13+ can be reversibly protonated to 13+&#8208;2H coupled with an electron transfer from the central RuII to the terminal RuIII, resulting in a change in electronic structure from LRuII+0.5&#8208;NC&#8208;RuII&#8208;CN&#8208;RuII+0.5L to HLRuII&#8208;NC&#8208;RuIII&#8208;CN&#8208;RuIILH. Cyclic voltammogram of 13+&#8208;2H showed very weak interaction between the two terminal Ru centers. The remarkable change in electronic states by protonation&#8208;induced electron transfer is also strongly supported by the (TD)DFT calculations. Complex 13+ may be potential for an excellent candidate of molecular switch.

         <title>Conclusive Insight into the Coordination Complexes of a Flexible Bis(&#946;&#8208;diketonato) Ligand and Their Phase&#8208;Dependent Structure: A Multi&#8208;Technique Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 32, June 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complexes of flexible bis(&#946;&#8208;diketonato) ligand bdhb2&#8722; are dimeric in the crystalline state but rearrange to monomeric in organic solution. The transformation, first detected on paramagnetic VO2+ and Co2+ derivatives, is conclusively proved through the preparation of diamagnetic [Zn2(bdhb)2(py)2] and its investigation by high&#8208;resolution 1H NMR spectroscopy in THF&#8208;d8 and CD2Cl2.








Abstract
Multichelating ligands with nuclear spin&#8208;free donor atoms are of particular interest for creating stable electronic spin qubits based on paramagnetic transition metal ions. We recently focused on the coordinating ability of the bis(&#946;&#8208;diketonato) ligand bdhb2&#8722;, featuring two &#8220;acac&#8221; moieties connected through a 1,3&#8208;phenylene bridge (H2bdhb&#160;=&#160;1,3&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;dioxo&#8208;1&#8208;hexyl)benzene). The two crystalline complexes of bdhb2&#8722; so far isolated and structurally characterized, namely [(VO)2(bdhb)2] (1) and [Co2(bdhb)2(py)4] (2), are dimeric and contain bridging bdhb2&#8722; ligands; however, they become mononuclear and quasi&#8208;macrocyclic in organic solution. To investigate this unique structural isomerism by high&#8208;resolution 1H NMR spectroscopy, we have now synthesized a diamagnetic Zn2+ analogue of 1 and 2, namely [Zn2(bdhb)2(py)2] (3). Although both 2 and 3 are dimeric and contain the same ligands, 3 features only one pyridine molecule per metal ion, whose coordination geometry is square pyramidal rather than tetragonally elongated octahedral. The ESI&#8208;MS spectra of 3 in THF and CH2Cl2 contain peaks from both monomeric and dimeric species. However, molecular weight determinations by DOSY and conformational studies based on J&#8208;coupling analysis and DFT calculations conclusively prove the rearrangement of 3 into quasi&#8208;macrocyclic monomers in THF&#8208;d8 and CD2Cl2 solution at room temperature.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Two Fucosylated Human Milk Oligosaccharides: 3&#8208;Fucosyllactose and Lacto&#8208;N&#8208;fucopentaose V</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 32, June 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
3&#8208;Fucosyllactose human milk oligosaccharide was produced using a reliable chemical synthesis approach. Also reported is the first chemical synthesis of lacto&#8208;N&#8208;fucopentaose V human milk oligosaccharide. The approach for the synthesis of lacto&#8208;N&#8208;fucopentaose V comprised a convergent&#160;2 + 3 assembly strategy, making use of a trisaccharide building block derived from 3&#8208;fucosyllactose.








Abstract
Glycans present in human milk have been the focus of many studies due to challenges associated with their synthesis. The development of new methods for obtaining individual glycans found in human milk has been a vibrant area of research in glycosciences. This study reports the synthesis of two fucosylated glycans found in human milk, 3&#8208;fucosyllactose, which was previously synthesized by both chemical and enzymatic methods, and the first chemical synthesis of lacto&#8208;N&#8208;fucopentaose V. Screening different protecting and leaving groups, as well as optimizing the glycosylation reaction conditions helped us to achieve efficient assembly and deprotection of these two fucosylated human milk oligosaccharides in good yields.

         <title>Quantitative Generation of HF from KF and Formation of Amine&#8208;3HF Complexes by Using Cation Exchange Reaction Between KF and Amberlyst 15DRY</title>

         <dc:description>
A safe and convenient method for the quantitative generation of HF from KF at room temperature was demonstrated using the cation exchange reaction between KF and Amberlyst 15DRY. The generated HF was quantitatively converted to a variety of amine&#8208;3HF complexes as candidates for nucleophilic fluorinating reagents.








Abstract
A safe and convenient method for the quantitative generation of hydrogen fluoride (HF) from potassium fluoride (KF) at room temperature was successfully demonstrated using the cation exchange reaction between KF and Amberlyst 15DRY in acetonitrile (MeCN). After one of the cation exchange reactions, HF was generated from KF in 69% yield. On the other hand, HF was generated quantitatively by removing the generated HF and repeating the cation exchange reaction seven times. During and after the cation exchange reaction, the generated HF was separated from the Amberlyst 15DRY by decantation and filtration without loss of HF. When the Amberlyst 15DRY was regenerated and then reused in the cation exchange reaction ten times, HF was generated almost quantitatively each time and the yield of HF did not decrease at all. In addition, when 1/3 equivalent of amines was added to the resulting HF&#8208;containing solution, a variety of amine&#8208;3HF complexes with controlled stoichiometric ratios were formed in quantitative yields.

         <title>QM/MM Unlocks The Catalytic Mechanism of YtfE: The Structural Reorganization of The Active Site Enables Nitrite&#8208;to&#8208;NO Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 32, June 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
QM/MM simulations reveal that the structural reorganization of the active site, particularly the alternation of the hydrogen bonding network and coordination switch of the HONO intermediate, is critical for the reductive cleavage of the N&#9472;O bond and NO formation in the nonheme diiron YtfE. This mechanistic insight advances understanding of nitrite reduction in nonheme diiron oxygenases and their biological roles.








Abstract
Escherichia coli (E. coli) repair of iron center protein (also known as YtfE) is a nonheme diiron protein that plays a pivotal role in bacterial responses to nitrosative stress, particularly in nitrite reduction and nitric oxide metabolism. Although previous studies have explored its potential as a nitrite reductase, the detailed catalytic mechanism, especially the role of its diiron center in nitrite reduction, remains poorly understood. In this study, we employed multiscale computational approaches, including quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM), quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics metadynamics (QM/MM MD), and quantum mechanics (QM) calculations, to elucidate the molecular mechanism of nitrite reduction by YtfE. Our findings reveal that structural reorganization of the active site, particularly the alternation of the hydrogen bonding network and coordination switch of the HONO intermediate, is critical for modulating the nitrite reduction mechanism. This work provides significant insights into the catalytic mechanism of YtfE, offering a theoretical foundation for understanding its role in bacterial stress responses and potential applications in synthetic biology and environmental remediation.

Three pairs of novel enantiomeric cinnamoyltriketone dimers (1&#8722;3) with unprecedented spiro[cyclohexane&#8208;1,2&#8242;&#8208;xanthene] or benzo[7,8]oxocino[4,5&#8208;b]chromene tetracyclic ring systems were isolated from Xanthostemon chrysanthus via a building blocks&#8208;based molecular network (BBMN) strategy.








Abstract
Three pairs of enantiomeric cinnamoyltriketone dimers, (+)&#8208; and (&#8722;)&#8208;xanthochrysanthones A&#8722;C [(+)&#8208; and (&#8722;)&#8208;1&#8211;3)], were recognized and obtained from Xanthostemon chrysanthus by employing the building blocks&#8208;based molecular network (BBMN) strategy. Compounds 1&#8211;3 featured two new types of lobster&#8208;shape carbon skeletons with unprecedented spiro[cyclohexane&#8208;1,2&#8242;&#8208;xanthene] or benzo[7,8]oxocino[4,5&#8208;b]chromene tetracyclic ring systems. Their structures with absolute configurations were established by comprehensive spectroscopic analyses, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and ECD calculations. Compounds 1&#8211;3 represent the first example of phloroglucinol derivatives that are biogenetically constructed by a De Mayo reaction followed by Michael addition. Additionally, compounds 1&#8211;3 exhibited significant antiviral activity against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Time&#8208;of&#8208;addition assays indicated that compound 3 specifically acts on the early stages of the virus replication process in RSV.

         <title>Impact of Octahedral Aluminum Sites on Guest Molecule Adsorption in Zeolites: A Computational Study of 5&#8208;Fluorouracil in Zeolite FAU</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 32, June 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dispersion&#8208;corrected density functional theory (DFT) calculations shed light on the interaction of the anticancer drug 5&#8208;fluorouracil (5&#8208;FU) with a framework&#8208;associated octahedral aluminum site in a FAU&#8208;type zeolite. The calculations help to explain the experimental observation of a limited 5&#8208;FU release from zeolite samples containing such sites.








Abstract
Many aluminosilicate zeolites contain octahedral aluminum sites, which may occur as extra&#8208;framework or framework&#8208;associated sites. Due to the Lewis acidity of these sites, their impact on catalytic properties has been investigated frequently. Comparatively less emphasis has been placed on their role in adsorption, despite evidence for an irreversible binding of some guest molecules like the anticancer drug 5&#8208;fluorouracil (5&#8208;FU) to octahedral Al atoms. In the present study, dispersion&#8208;corrected density functional theory (DFT) calculations and DFT&#8208;based ab initio molecular dynamics simulations (AIMD) are employed to investigate the adsorption of 5&#8208;FU at a framework&#8208;associated octahedral Al site in zeolite FAU. The calculations show that 5&#8208;FU remains coordinated to the Al atom at room temperature and in the presence of water. In contrast, 5&#8208;FU molecules adsorbed at framework protons are quickly displaced by water molecules. It is thus demonstrated that octahedral Al atoms will negatively affect the release of 5&#8208;FU from zeolite hosts in drug delivery applications. A comparison of DFT&#8208;calculated infrared (IR) spectra to literature data provides evidence that Al&#8208;coordinated 5&#8208;FU molecules were indeed present in previously investigated samples.

         <title>Development of Water&#8208;Soluble 3&#8208;Nitro&#8208;2&#8208;Pyridinesulfenate for Disulfide Bond Formation of Peptide Under Aqueous Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 32, June 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly water&#8208;soluble Npy&#8208;sulfenate functions as an efficient oxidizing agent for the formation of disulfide bonds in thiol&#8208;containing peptides. The Npy&#8208;sulfenate can be used to form a disulfide bond with a thiol&#8208;containing peptide produced by thiol&#8208;additive&#8208;free NCL, thereby facilitating the one&#8208;pot synthesis of adrenomedullin. These results provide a new one&#8208;pot synthetic methodology for cyclic disulfide peptides based on sulfenate&#8208;mediated oxidation.








Abstract
Establishing an efficient method for the synthesis of disulfide bonds in peptides is an important challenge for the further development of several research fields, including peptide&#8208;based medicinal chemistry and biochemistry. Herein, we report the development of a novel highly water&#8208;soluble 3&#8208;nitro&#8208;2&#8208;pyridine (Npy) sulfenate that efficiently forms intramolecular disulfide bonds in reduced peptides. Moreover, Npy&#8208;sulfenate formed a disulfide bond in a thiol&#8208;containing peptide prepared by thiol&#8208;additive&#8208;free native chemical ligation (NCL), as demonstrated by the one&#8208;pot synthesis of adrenomedullin, which contains 52 amino acid residues. This study provides a new one&#8208;pot synthetic methodology for preparing mid&#8208;sized cyclic disulfide peptides via sulfenate&#8208;mediated oxidation.

&lt;p&gt;Highly water-soluble Npy-sulfenate functions as an efficient oxidizing agent for the formation of disulfide bonds in thiol-containing peptides. The Npy-sulfenate can be used to form a disulfide bond with a thiol-containing peptide produced by thiol-additive-free NCL, thereby facilitating the one-pot synthesis of adrenomedullin. These results provide a new one-pot synthetic methodology for cyclic disulfide peptides based on sulfenate-mediated oxidation.

         <title>Dihalogens Binding and Activation by Imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;Chalcogenone Model Derivatives: Insight from a Computational Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 32, June 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;chalcogenones react with dihalogens, initially forming a charge&#8208;transfer (CT) adduct, which may evolve to the most stable T&#8208;shaped hypercoordinate (TY) species. However, in silico results show that the CT adduct is more stable than the corresponding TY species for the sulfur and iodine combination. This exception is rationalized within the framework of activation strain analysis.








Abstract
Chalcogenone donors represent a fundamental chemical class of compounds in the treatment of hyperthyroidism; particularly, imidazoline&#8208;based systems are associated with the strongest affinity for I2. Therefore, the reactivity of these types of donors with dihalogens may be insightful to understand the mechanism of action of popular drugs, such as methimazole (1&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;thione, MMI). In this work, the reactivity of 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;chalcogenone (S, Se, Te) with dihalogens X2 (X&#160;=&#160;Cl, Br, I) is evaluated for any combination through a systematic computational study. Three different products are found: a linear charge transfer (CT) &#8220;spoke&#8221; adduct, a &#8220;T&#8208;shaped&#8221; intermediate (TI), and a &#8220;T&#8208;shaped&#8221; hypercoordinate species (TY). The halogen and chalcogen effects are discussed separately as for the solvation effects. Furthermore, only the TY species formed from the reaction between 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;thione and I2 resulted to be disfavored with respect to the corresponding CT adduct; therefore, this peculiarity is rationalized in the framework of activation strain analysis. Lastly, a possible alternative mechanism involving the formation of a cationic intermediate species is considered.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Induced C&#9472;C Bond Cleavage for the Construction of Ketone Using Molecular Oxygen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 32, June 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an eco&#8208;firiendly photocatalytic protocol that achieves efficient C&#9472;C bond cleavage for synthesizing aromatic ketones and their derivatives. Employing molecular oxygen as the sole oxidant, the developed strategy eliminates the need for external oxidizing agents or transition metal catalysts, enabling sustainable bond scission under remarkably mild reaction conditions.









Abstract
The selective cleavage of carbon&#8208;carbon bonds by photocatalysis with the participation of oxygen for ketone synthesis and drug derivatization is reported. In this oxidation&#8208;based ketone formation reaction, molecular oxygen complexes with the substrate, which is subsequently photoexcited to generate a charge transfer (CT) state. This CT state facilitates energy transfer with molecular oxygen, producing singlet oxygen, which facilitates hydrogen atom process and promotes the subsequent cleavage of the carbon&#8211;carbon bond, ultimately leading to the formation of aryl ketone compounds. 48 aryl ketone compounds and pharmaceutical derivatives were synthesized using this method. A notable feature of this reaction is its catalyst&#8208;free, additive&#8208;free, and transition metals&#8208;free nature combined with green, mild, and environmentally friendly reaction conditions enabling high yields.

         <title>Fluorescent Chromophore Construction via Through&#8208;Space Conjugation of Caprolactam and Itaconic Acid: Mechanistic Validation Enabled by 3D&#8208;Printed Architectures</title>

Nonaromatic fluorescent colloids are formed by thermally driven hydrogen bonding between CPL and ITA. Disrupting the hydrogen bonds within the system by 3D printing quenches the fluorescence, which enables applications as fluorescent materials. The colloids can be used as sustainable, low&#8208;cost alternatives to aromatic systems.








Abstract
Fluorescence characteristics are generally attributed to conjugated molecular structures. Substances exhibiting chromatic or fluorescent effects hold significant application value in functional coatings, biochemical detection, anti&#8208;counterfeiting technologies, and pharmaceutical tracking due to their distinctive optical identification properties. Although numerous fluorescent materials have been developed, research on fluorescence mechanisms in low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight substances remains insufficient. This study serendipitously discovered that a simple thermal mixing reaction between caprolactam (CPL) and itaconic acid (ITA) can produce a fluorescent&#8208;colored metastable colloidal system. The colloid exhibits exceptional stability at ambient temperature, maintaining noncrystalline status or forming novel butterfly/leaf&#8208;like crystal structures upon cooling, with reversible colloidal characteristics through thermal cycling. Through comprehensive characterization using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT&#8208;IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and polarized optical microscopy, we elucidated the chromatic and fluorescent mechanisms: intermolecular hydrogen bonding networks facilitate the construction of spatial conjugation systems containing unsaturated groups, achieving photoluminescence via &#960;&#8208;electron orbital transitions. The reliability of fluorescence color generation mechanism was confirmed by 3D printing side. This material exhibits excellent solubility in common solvents and shows promising potential for developing fluorescent composites through polymer matrix incorporation.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Site CuZn Alloy Boosts Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia via Optimized Intermediate Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 32, June 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermetallic CuZn optimizes the nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) pathway by tuning the adsorption energies and configurations of NOx and NOxH (x&#160;=&#160;1, 2, and 3) intermediates. The synergistic effect between Cu and Zn sites breaks the scaling relationship and enhances catalytic activity.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) is an effective way to solve nitrate pollution and a promising strategy for ammonia (NH3) synthesis under ambient temperature and pressure. However, NO3RR is still hindered by the lack of efficient catalysts and an understanding of mechanisms that enhance the catalytic performance. In this study, we propose intermetallic alloying as a promising strategy to optimize the NO3RR reaction pathway by tuning the adsorption energies and configurations of intermediates, as demonstrated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations comparing NO3RR performance of Cu (111) and CuZn (110) surfaces. In CuZn alloy, the electron&#8208;donating property of Cu weakens the adsorption of NOx (x = 1, 2, and 3) intermediates, whereas the electron&#8208;accepting property of Zn strengthens the binding of NOxH intermediates, thus lowering the protonation reaction energy. Zn sites preferentially promote the removal of O species, whereas Cu sites dominate the protonation of N species. This synergistic effect enables CuZn (110) surface to successfully break the undesirable scaling relationship in traditional metal catalysts, resulting in excellent catalytic activity for NO3RR, with an ultra&#8208;low limiting potential of &#8722;0.28&#160;V. This work provides valuable insights and theoretical guidance for NO3RR.

         <title>In Situ Real&#8208;Time Imaging of Benzyl&#8208;Naphthalimide Dyes Revealing Diverse Structural Evolution Dynamics at the Single&#8208;Assembly Level</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 32, June 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ real&#8208;time imaging of the dynamic growth and network formation of benzyl&#8208;naphthalimide dye assemblies were performed through confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and their different growth modes were resolved. These results elucidate distinct structure and assembly dynamics of the three assemblies. This highlights the unique advantages of confocal microscopy in investigating assembly processes and kinetic analysis.








Abstract
Fluorescence imaging has emerged as a powerful technique for in situ monitoring of self&#8208;assembly dynamics providing critical insights into structural evolution and functional potential. However, the inherent complexity of supramolecular systems presents significant challenges for real&#8208;time visualization, particularly in capturing the growth kinetics of individual assemblies and the hierarchical formation of network structures at the single&#8208;assembly level. Here, we visualized the dynamic growth and network formation of benzyl&#8208;naphthalimide dye assemblies in situ by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). In situ time&#8208;lapse imaging revealed distinct dynamic growth mechanisms among the three assemblies. Theoretical calculations demonstrated that different amino substituents significantly influenced assembly morphologies by modulating the planarity of the naphthalene ring. Furthermore, fluorescence lifetime imaging revealed pronounced intra&#8208;assembly heterogeneity, highlighting diverse molecular packing arrangements within individual assemblies. The confocal in situ visualization technique provided single&#8208;assembly growth dynamics, offering insights unattainable through conventional spectroscopic methods. Our work reveals that naphthalimide&#8208;based molecules can self&#8208;assemble into a variety of distinct architectures, underscoring their potential for designing advanced functional materials with tunable properties.

         <title>Oxidative Release of Natural Glycans (ORNG): Preparation of Truncated N&#8208;glycans for Engineering Glycoproteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 32, June 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we introduce a groundbreaking method of oxidative release of natural glycans (ORNG), enabling the efficient synthesis of mono&#8208;N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) N&#8208;glycans. Leveraging this innovative approach, we generate a versatile library of truncated N&#8208;glycans and their oxazoline derivatives, facilitating the homogeneous glycosylation of monoclonal antibodies. Our results showcase the potential of ORNG in enhancing glycoprotein synthesis, offering substantial implications for biomedical research and therapeutic applications. Through detailed analysis and application, this work provides a foundation for future advancements in glycoengineering, aiming to overcome traditional barriers in glycan synthesis and functional exploration.








Abstract
N&#8208;glycosylation on asparagine is one of the most common post&#8208;translational modifications of proteins. The synthesis of homogeneous N&#8208;glycopeptides and glycoproteins is crucial for elucidating the concerted functions of glycans and peptides. Multiple endoglycosidase mutants have been developed to efficiently catalyze the coupling of oxazoline derivatives of N&#8208;glycans lacking the innermost N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) (mono&#8208;GlcNAc N&#8208;glycan) with peptide chains bearing a GlcNAcylated asparagine. However, the bottleneck for N&#8208;glycopeptide and glycoprotein synthesis remains access to these complex truncated N&#8208;glycan substrates in sufficient diversity and quantity. Here, we report a novel chemical method using modified oxidative release of natural glycans (ORNG) to produce a diverse library of mono&#8208;GlcNAc N&#8208;glycans and their oxazoline derivatives, paving the way for the facile synthesis of N&#8208;glycopeptides and glycoproteins. Using these substrates, homogeneous N&#8208;glycosylation of monoclonal antibodies can be efficiently achieved.

         <title>Litchi&#8208;Skin&#8208;Like NiMoP2 Microspheres Supported on MOF&#8208;Derived Carbon Layer as High Performance Composite Positive Electrode of Asymmetric Supercapacitor</title>

Supercapacitor Electrode: Litchi&#8208;skin&#8208;like morphology NiMoP2 microspheres loaded on MOF&#8208;derived carbon layers for enhancing the electrochemical performance of ASCs.








Abstract
Developing ideal positive electrodes with excellent performance and structural stability for supercapacitors is crucial in enhancing the application potential. Herein, we successfully fabricate a composite structure of NiMoP2@C on nickel foam (NF) (NMP@C/NF), which is formed by loading a litchi&#8208;skin&#8208;like morphology NiMoP2 microspheres onto MOF&#8208;derived carbon layer with the two&#8208;step electrodeposition method. The carbon layer acts as a structurally stable framework, and its synergistic effect with active materials suppresses volume expansion while enhancing electron transport efficiency. Meanwhile, the heterogeneous interface between crystalline/amorphous phases optimizes redox reaction kinetics, and the unique morphology composed of multi&#8208;scale components increases the accessible surface area for redox reactions. As a result, the NMP@C/NF obtains a high specific capacitance of 2224.8 F g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1, and the capacitance retention rate is 94.97% after 8000 cycles. The asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) assembled with NMP@C/NF positive electrode and active carbon negative electrode generates an energy density of 52.52&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 784.55&#160;W kg&#8722;1, and its capacitance retention rate reaches up to 78% after 8000 cycles. This study provides promising pathway for the rational design of high&#8208;performance and environmentally friendly positive electrodes for supercapacitors.

         <title>Efficient Access of Heterocycles Utilizing Inherent Carbodicationic Reactivity of Ynone via Lewis Acid Catalysed C&#9472;C Triple Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 32, June 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient silver&#8208;catalysed triple cascade reaction has been developed to afford easy access to quinazolinone, quinazoline, and benzazole utilizing the gem&#8208;carbodicationic character of ynone. This triple cascade reaction involves sequential conjugate addition followed by Grob&#8208;type fragmentation assisted by stereoelectronic effect. Complex heterocycles have been synthesised by combining this triple cascade reaction followed by a cross&#8208;coupling reaction in the same synthetic sequence.








Abstract
Divalent carbodicationic synthon has attracted significant attention due to its unique reactivity and bonding. The application of this synthon in synthetic settings is still fancy owing to its super&#8208;electrophilicity. Generation of this reactive intermediate in a catalytic fashion is challenging. For the first time, the reactivity of the chemical equivalent of divalent dication synthon has been proposed via Lewis acid&#8208;catalysed heterolytic ionisation of ynone via sequential conjugate addition to ynone followed by C&#9472;C bond cleavage to afford heteroarenes. A library of quinazolinones and 2&#8208;substituted quinazolinones has been synthesised with good to excellent yields having a wide range of functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope using 2&#8208;amino benzamides as a nucleophilic partner. Furthermore, 1,2&#8208;diaminobenzenes afforded the corresponding benzimidazole in synthetically good yield. The generality of this strategy has been demonstrated by the successful synthesis of 6&#8208;mono and 2,6&#8208;di&#8208;substituted quinazolinones and 2,4,6&#8208;tri&#8208;substituted quinazoline with very high efficiency. The mechanistic study confirmed the role of the cooperative effect and secondary orbital interaction in Grob&#8208;type fragmentation and not the involvement of any radical intermediate in the catalytic cycle.

         <title>Minisci Reaction by an MW&#8208;Boost: A Simple Protocol for Site&#8208;Selective Dehydrogenative Cross&#8208;Coupling Between Nitrogen&#8208;Aromatics and C(sp3)&#9472;H Bonds</title>

The Minisci&#8208;type cross&#8208;coupling reaction between C&#9472;(sp3)&#9472;H bonds and nitrogen&#8208;containing aromatics proceeded successfully using a simple protocol based on MW (microwave) irradiation with a persulfate anion. The MW/PS protocol is applicable to a wide variety of dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling leading to the formation of alkylated heteroaromatics, in which the site&#8208;selectivity is ensured by a HAT transition state with a sulfate radical. The MW/persulfate protocol was applicable to direct intramolecular cyclization to give five and six&#8208;membered ring fused lutidine derivatives.








Abstract
The Minisci&#8208;type reaction between C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds and nitrogen&#8208;containing aromatics was carried out using a simple protocol based on the persulfate anion (PS) under microwave (MW) irradiation. The MW/PS protocol is applicable to a wide variety of dehydrogenative coupling reactions of N&#8208;heteroaromatics and C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds, leading to the formation of alkylated heteroaromatics. Site&#8208;selectivity is ensured by hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) with the sulfate radical affecting the polar/steric effects in the transition state. The MW/PS protocol was applicable to direct intramolecular cyclization to give five and six&#8208;membered rings fused by pyridine and lutidine, which, in previous methods, it was necessary to use tedious derivatization to imino&#8208;oxyacetic acids as HAT precursors.

         <title>Single Crystals of a Covalent Organic Polymer for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 32, June 6, 2025. </description>

This study reports the preparation of 1D polymer single crystals (CityU&#8208;49) based on dative boron&#8208;nitrogen bonds. The dynamic B&#8592;N bonds enabled precise self&#8208;assembly and high crystallinity. CityU&#8208;49 has been demonstrated to show excellent photocatalytic activity, achieving 95% degradation of rhodamine B in 300 minutes highlighting its potential for environmental remediation and advancing the design of crystalline covalent organic polymers.








Abstract
Covalent organic polymers (COPs) with high crystallinity and excellent stability is very important for potential applications in photocatalysis and environmental remediation. However, most COPs are amorphous, limiting their structural characterization, photocatalytic performance, and mechanism exploration. In this study, we report the construction of a crystalline 1D COP (CityU&#8208;49) via dative boron&#8592;nitrogen (B&#8592;N) bonds using 3,6&#8208;di(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole (DPC) as the nitrogen donor and 1,4&#8208;bis(benzodioxaborole) as the boron donor. The dynamic and directional nature of B&#8592;N bonds enables a self&#8208;healing and self&#8208;correcting assembly process resulting in a highly crystalline and stable structure. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) revealed the precise structure of CityU&#8208;49 providing insights into its ordered architecture. The photocatalytic performance of CityU&#8208;49 was conducted to investigat the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) (a persistent and toxic organic pollutant). Under UV light irradiation, CityU&#8208;49 achieves 95% degradation of RhB in 300 minutes demonstrating excellent photocatalytic activity and environmental applicability. This study highlights the potential of crystalline COPs as efficient and sustainable photocatalysts paving the way for the development of advanced materials for environmental remediation and green technologies.

1,8&#8208;naphthylene&#8208;based 1,10&#8208;diynes (anti/syn mixture) underwent Rh&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular cycloaddition with alkynoates to afford highly enantioenriched, thermodynamically stable chiral cycloadducts.

Abstract
In this paper, we describe a chiral Rh&#8208;catalyzed [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition of 1,8&#8208;naphthylene&#8208;based 1,10&#8208;diynes of an anti/syn mixture with alkynoates. Thermodynamically stable saddle&#8208;shaped chiral cycloadducts were obtained in good&#8208;to&#8208;high yields and enantiomeric ratios. Hetero [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition using aryl cyanides also proceeded to give the corresponding inherently chiral pyridine&#8208;containing compounds.

         <title>Two&#8208;photon Excitation of Bright Diaza[4]Helicenes for Isotropic and Circularly Polarized Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 32, June 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tris&#8208;p&#8208;OMe cationic diaza[4]helicenes with improved (CPL) brightness (up to 3.4 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1 for 2d) are achieved by combining high &#934;f and enhanced chiroptical properties arising with branched N&#8208;substituents. Efficient 2PE at 810&#160;nm and 2PE CPL spectra are reported, the latter being uncommon for small organic molecules. Their viability in cell imaging by 1PE and 2PE confocal microscopy was also proven.








Abstract
Helicenes are chiral organic dyes that are attracting growing attention due to the high tunability of their (chir)optical and electronic properties. In this work, a series of functionalized cationic diaza[4]helicenes based on dimethoxyquinacridinium (DMQA) scaffolds are presented. By merging branched N&#8208;alkyl side chains and triple para&#8208;functionalization with OMe groups, structures combine improved chiroptical responses (5x increase) and strong fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;f&#160;&#8776;&#160;70% in acetonitrile). An overall improved efficiency of the emission of circularly polarized light with BCPL values reaching 3.4 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1 is obtained. Additionally, two&#8208;photon excitation (2PE) studies were performed, showing good values of cross section (CS) at 810&#160;nm. Interestingly, 2PE circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectra were acquired for the most performant derivatives (N&#8208;isopropyl and N&#8208;cyclohexyl); this type of measurement being usually challenging for organic molecular species. Finally, the viability of these compounds in single&#8208;photon (1PE)&#160;and 2PE microscopy is also shown.

The unified catalytic asymmetric total syntheses of (iso)voacangines, 3&#8208;oxo&#8208;(iso)voacangines, and (3S)&#8208;cyano(iso)voacangines were achieved for the first time. The syntheses hinged on a catalytic asymmetric Michael/aldol reaction for the construction of chiral aza&#8208;[3.3.1]&#8208;bridged bicyclic framework at the early stage and a ring reconstruction from [3.3.1]&#8208; to [2.2.2]&#8208;bicyclic ring system at the late stage.








Abstract
The proposed post&#8208;iboga natural products, (+)&#8208;tabercarpamines G and I, along with their corresponding C20 stereoisomers and C10&#8208;methoxy&#8208;regioisomers were synthesized. An extensive NMR spectroscopic study showed that the spectral data of these synthetic compounds were not consistent with the proposed (+)&#8208;tabercarpamines G and I in isolation report, indicating that the proposed structures were misassigned. Subsequently, from the advanced intermediates for the synthesis of the proposed (+)&#8208;tabercarpamines G and I, the unified enantioselective syntheses of six iboga&#8210;type natural products including (&#8208;)&#8208;isovoacangine and (&#8208;)&#8208;voacangine, (&#8208;)&#8208;3&#8208;oxo&#8208;isovoacangine and (&#8208;)&#8208;3&#8208;oxo&#8208;voacangine, and (&#8208;)&#8208;(3S)&#8208;cyanoisovoacangine and (&#8208;)&#8208;(3S)&#8208;cyanovoacangine were accomplished via a divergent manner. The synthetic route provided the first catalytic asymmetric approach to access these three types of iboga&#8210;type natural products and achieved the first enantioselective syntheses of (3S)&#8208;cyano(iso)voacangines. Our synthesis hinged on a catalytic asymmetric Michael/aldol reaction for the construction of chiral aza&#8208;[3.3.1]&#8208;bridged bicyclic framework at the early stage and a ring reorganization process from [3.3.1]&#8208; to [2.2.2]&#8208;bicyclic ring system&#8213;a pathway opposite to the proposed biogenic synthesis&#8213;at the late stage.

         <title>Exploring the Modulation of the Complex Folding Landscape of Human Telomeric DNA by a Low Molecular Weight Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 32, June 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time&#8208;resolved nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy were utilized to investigate the complex G&#8208;quadruplex folding landscape of the human telomeric DNA in the presence of the ligand Phen&#8208;DC3. Our findings revealed significant differences in the kinetics of the pathways originating from the unfolded or K+&#8208;bound state.








Abstract
Telomeric DNA forms G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structures. These G4 structures are crucial for genomic stability and therapeutic targeting. Using time&#8208;resolved NMR and CD spectroscopy, we investigated how the ligand Phen&#8208;DC3 modulates the folding of the human telomeric repeat 23TAG DNA. The kinetics are modulated by the ligand and by the presence of potassium cations (K+). Ligand binding to G4 occurs via a triphasic process with fast and slow phases. Notably, for the G4 structure in the presence of K+, the slow rate is ten times slower than without K+. These findings offer key insights into the modulation of the complex folding landscape of G4s by ligands, advancing our understanding of G4&#8208;ligand interactions for potential therapeutic applications.

         <title>Lewis&#8208;X&#8208;Containing Triterpenoid Saponins Inhibit DC&#8208;SIGN&#8208; and L&#8208;SIGN&#8208;Mediated Transfer of HIV&#8208;1 Infection</title>

The convergent synthesis of Lewis&#8208;X&#8208;containing betulinic acid and echinocystic acid saponins (1 and 2) is presented. The synthetic saponins were shown to inhibit, at the low micromolar range, the DC&#8208;SIGN&#8208; and L&#8208;SIGN&#8208;mediated transfer of HIV&#8208;1 infection to CD4&#8208;positive cells, whereas free Lewis&#8208;X, aglycones, and structurally similar triterpenoid saponins lacking the fucose residue were not.








Abstract
Blocking dendritic cell&#8208;specific intercellular adhesion molecule&#8208;3&#8208;grabbing nonintegrin (DC&#8208;SIGN)&#8208; and liver/lymph node&#8208;specific intercellular adhesion molecule&#8208;3&#8208;grabbing integrin (L&#8208;SIGN)&#8208;mediated human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV&#8208;1) attachment to immune cells represents a promising strategy for developing antiretroviral agents effective during the early stages of sexual transmission. Although mannose&#8208; and fucose&#8208;based ligands have received considerable attention, Lewis&#8208;based inhibitors remain relatively underexplored. In this study, we report the first synthesis of Lewis&#8208;X&#8208;containing triterpenoid saponins featuring betulinic acid and echinocystic acid as aglycones. These saponins were stereoselectively and efficiently synthesized in six linear steps using a convergent approach that leveraged thioglycoside and trichloroacetimidate glycosylation chemistries. Notably, our findings demonstrate that these Lewis&#8208;X&#8208;containing triterpenoid saponins are among the most potent monovalent inhibitors reported to date of DC&#8208;SIGN&#8208; and L&#8208;SIGN&#8208;mediated transfer of HIV&#8208;1 infection to CD4&#8208;positive cells, with IC50&#160;values in the low micromolar range (21&#8211;50 &#181;M). This work lays a valuable foundation for the development of saponin&#8208;based antiviral agents targeting immune cells.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Induced Structural Rearrangement in an M8L2 Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the reversible nature of the metal&#8211;ligand bond, coordination cages are inherently dynamic architectures which can undergo structural transformations upon appropriate external stimulations. This adaptability has been widely explored in various fields. Herein, we report the preparation of a redox&#8208;responsive discrete (Ru2)4L2 architecture through a coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly approach, where Ru2 is a bis(ruthenium(II)) complex and L a tetrapyridyl ligand. Importantly, ligand L is designed around the &#960;&#8208;extended tetrathiafulvalene framework (exTTF), whose geometry is highly sensitive to its redox state. The resulting (Ru2)4L2 assembly was fully characterized revealing a twisted configuration with two orthogonally oriented L units in close spatial proximity. Remarkably, this assembly undergoes an oxidation&#8208;induced transformation into a (Ru2)4Lox2 structure, in which the two dicationic ligands are now spatially separated and aligned according to a face&#8208;to&#8208;face arrangement, affording a cage&#8208;like structure. This reorganization is driven by the redox&#8208;induced geometric and electronic changes of the exTTF cores and the resulting electrostatic repulsions occurring between both oxidized ligands. The process is fully reversible upon chemical reduction, restoring the original (Ru2)4L2 structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Macrocyclic Arenes with Expanded Cavities from Seven&#8208;Membered Ring&#8208;Fused Monomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Numerous macrocyclic arenes have been synthesized from various types of aromatic monomers. However, the rotation of monomer units often reduces the internal cavity volume. To address this issue, seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring&#8208;fused monomers were employed for the synthesis of macrocyclic arenes. The fusion of aromatic units via seven&#8208;membered rings introduces a bent geometry into the macrocyclic framework, which reduces conformational flexibility and helps preserve a stable and expanded internal cavity in both solution and solid states.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
We report a Pd/Xantphos&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#9472;P cross&#8208;coupling reaction of aryl thianthrenium salts with a range of organophosphorus compounds, including H&#8208;phosphonate diesters, H&#8208;phosphinate esters, and secondary phosphine oxides. This method offers several advantages, including broad functional group tolerance, scalability to gram&#8208;scale synthesis, and applicability to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules.








Abstract
The utilization of sulfonium salts in synthesis has gained significant attention in recent years due to their easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle features and robust reactivity. Herein, we report a Pd/Xantphos&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling reaction of aryl thianthrenium salts with organophosphorus compounds, including H&#8208;phosphonate diesters, H&#8208;phosphinate esters, and secondary phosphine oxides. This protocol tolerates an array of functional groups and is applicable to gram&#8208;scale synthesis and late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules.

         <title>Push and Pull: the Impact of Amino and Nitro Substituents on Heteroleptic Cu(I) Photosensitizers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Giving or stealing: Four new heteroleptic Cu(I) complexes containing a nitro or amino group at the 5&#8208;position of the phenanthroline backbone were prepared and systematically studied. The different mesomeric and inductive effects of these substituents have a strong influence on the electrochemical and excited&#8208;state behavior as well as on the photocatalytic activity.








Abstract
This study presents the synthesis and characterization of four novel heteroleptic Cu(I) complexes incorporating nitro&#8208; and amino&#8208;substituted phenanthroline ligands. Their molecular structures, featuring a substituent at the 5&#8208;position of the phenanthroline backbone, were elucidated by X&#8208;ray crystallography and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Spectroscopic and electrochemical investigations revealed distinct mesomeric (M) and inductive (I) effects of the NO&#8322; and NH&#8322; substituents on the photophysical and electronic properties. The electron&#8208;withdrawing NO&#8322; group (&#8208;M, &#8208;I) stabilizes the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), shifts the reduction potential by&#160;+0.9&#160;V and completely quenches emission via nonradiative processes. In contrast, the electron&#8208;donating NH&#8322; group (+M, &#8208;I) induces a moderate redshift (&#8776; 25&#160;nm) in absorption and leads to long&#8208;lived, nonemissive excited states, particularly in CunNH&#8322; (29.1 &#181;s). Photocatalytic tests revealed no hydrogen evolution, but NH&#8322;&#8208;substituted complexes efficiently generated singlet oxygen (&#185;O&#8322;) with quantum yields of up to 39.8%. These findings demonstrate how small structural modifications can fundamentally alter the photophysics and catalytic behavior of Cu(I) complexes, providing valuable design principles for next&#8208;generation photosensitizers (PSs).

&lt;p&gt;This study presents the synthesis and characterization of four novel heteroleptic Cu(I) complexes incorporating nitro- and amino-substituted phenanthroline ligands. Their molecular structures, featuring a substituent at the 5-position of the phenanthroline backbone, were elucidated by X-ray crystallography and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Spectroscopic and electrochemical investigations revealed distinct mesomeric (M) and inductive (I) effects of the NO&#8322; and NH&#8322; substituents on the photophysical and electronic properties. The electron-withdrawing NO&#8322; group (-M, -I) stabilizes the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), shifts the reduction potential by&#160;+0.9&#160;V and completely quenches emission via nonradiative processes. In contrast, the electron-donating NH&#8322; group (+M, -I) induces a moderate redshift (&#8776; 25&#160;nm) in absorption and leads to long-lived, nonemissive excited states, particularly in CunNH&#8322; (29.1 &#181;s).

These findings demonstrate how small structural modifications can fundamentally alter the photophysics and catalytic behavior of Cu(I) complexes, providing valuable design principles for next-generation photosensitizers (PSs).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Investigation of the Degree of Functionalization and Colloidal Stability of Shell&#8208;by&#8208;Shell Functionalized TiO2 Nanoparticles as a Function of Different Phosphonic Acid Chain Lengths</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Shell&#8208;by&#8208;Shell structures of TiO2 nanoparticles, phosphonic acids (PAs) and sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) in their solid and colloidal state were studied by thermogravimetric analysis and analytical ultracentrifugation. This combination showed that agglomerates were formed whose size depended on the PA chain length. This allowed conclusions to be drawn about the efficiency of the overlap between the PA and SDBS.








Abstract
In this work, a series of Shell&#8208;by&#8208;Shell (SbS)&#8208;functionalized colloidal systems consisting of 6&#160;nm TiO2 anatase nanoparticles (NPs), one of the phosphonic acids (PAs) propylphosphonic acid (PAC3), hexylphosphonic acid (PAC6), dodecylphosphonic acid (PAC12), tetradecylphosphonic acid (PAC14), hexadecylphosphonic acid (PAC16), octadecylphosphonic acid (PAC18) and the amphiphile sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) were prepared, resulting in TiO2&#8208;PACX@SDBS (X&#160;=&#160;3, 6, 12, 14, 16, or 18) NPs dispersed in deionized water (DIW). During the whole functionalization process, the NPs were subjected to thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to gain insights into their degree of functionalization and respective thermal stability. In addition, the colloidal stability of the NPs as a function of PA chain length was analyzed by analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC). By combining both TGA and AUC, it was found that the resulting hierarchical NP architectures form agglomerates, with the degree of agglomeration depending on the length of the PA used for the first&#8208;shell functionalization. This allows conclusions to be drawn about the efficiency of the overlap between the PA and the SDBS carbon chains.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Ethylene Methoxycarbonylation Using Bidentate Phosphines: How the Stereochemistry of the Ligand Affects the Catalyst's Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Within the first 50 minutes in Pd&#8208;catalyzed ethylene methoxycarbonylation, racemic pytbpx (B) outperformed meso pytbpx (B) by hindering CO coordination on the Pd&#9472;H complex producing a higher yield (99 vs. 8%), highlighting the enhanced diastereomeric effect, while dtbpx (A) exhibited the highest methanolysis energy barrier and the lowest activity (2%), emphasizing the significant built&#8208;in base effect in pytbpx (B).








Abstract
To elucidate the diastereomeric control of bidentate P&#8208;ligands in the ethylene methoxycarbonylation, a comparative and systematic experimental and computational investigation was conducted on the catalytic activity of the Pd&#8208;complexes of the racemic, meso, and epimerized LIKATphos ligands (pytbpx, B) as well as the Lucite ligand (dtbpx, A). The experimental study revealed that the racemic ligand (pytbpx, B) exhibited the highest catalytic activity, while the Lucite ligand (dtbpx, A) exhibited the lowest activity, and the meso ligand (pytbpx, B) exhibited moderate activity. This activity order follows the same trend as the CO coordination energy to the palladium hydride complex for B, while the methanolysis is the rate&#8208;limiting step with A. The enhanced catalytic activity exhibited by the chiral pytbpx (B) is attributed to the higher stability of the hydride complex and lower stability of the CO complex compared to the meso pytbpx (B). The higher activity of the Pd&#8208;complexes of pytbpx (B) over the Pd&#8208;complexes of dtbpx (A) is attributed to the built&#8208;in base effect.

         <title>Reversible Photocyclization of Imidazoleisoindole&#8208;Based Stilbene Derivative Apparently over NonTriene Form</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imidazoleisoindole&#8208;based stilbene analogue undergoes E&#8211;Z photoisomerization and unusual photocyclization over a formal nontriene C&#9552;C&#9472;C&#9552;C&#9472;C&#9472;N structure, which is rationally supported by X&#8208;ray and DFT&#8208;based analyses. The photochemical quantum yields over 0.3 is observed for the cyclization reaction. While the hexatriene structure is assumed as a minor mesomeric form, the ground state HOMO/LUMO symmetry resembles usual diarylethenes and satisfies Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann rules for photocyclization.








Abstract
Diarylethene is one of the most extensively studied photochromic compounds due to its remarkable properties. Recently, nitrogen&#8208;based diarylethenes (DAEs) have been reported to exhibit unusual photochromic behavior. In this study, we synthesized an imidazoleisoindole&#8208;based stilbene analogue, which involves a neutral C&#9552;C&#9472;C&#9552;C&#9472;C&#9472;N framework, along with a C&#9552;C&#9472;C&#9552;C&#9472;C&#9552;N form as a minor mesomeric form.

&lt;p&gt;Imidazoleisoindole-based stilbene analogue undergoes &lt;i&gt;E&#8211;Z&lt;/i&gt; photoisomerization and unusual photocyclization over a formal nontriene C&#9552;C&#9472;C&#9552;C&#9472;C&#9472;N structure, which is rationally supported by X-ray and DFT-based analyses. The photochemical quantum yields over 0.3 is observed for the cyclization reaction. While the hexatriene structure is assumed as a minor mesomeric form, the ground state HOMO/LUMO symmetry resembles usual diarylethenes and satisfies Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann rules for photocyclization.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diarylethene is one of the most extensively studied photochromic compounds due to its remarkable properties. Recently, nitrogen-based diarylethenes (DAEs) have been reported to exhibit unusual photochromic behavior. In this study, we synthesized an imidazoleisoindole-based stilbene analogue, which involves a neutral C&#9552;C&#9472;C&#9552;C&#9472;C&#9472;N framework, along with a C&#9552;C&#9472;C&#9552;C&#9472;C&#9552;N form as a minor mesomeric form. Crystal structural analysis supported the major contribution of the former form. Surprisingly, the molecule exhibited not only &lt;i&gt;E&#8211;Z&lt;/i&gt; photoisomerization but also the photocyclization reaction with a quantum yield of 0.3. The orbital symmetry of the HOMO and LUMO around the reactive center closely resembled to that of typical DAEs and satisfied the Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann rules. Imidazolium analogue is also studied for comparison. The imidazoleisoindole-based stilbene analogue represents a novel and unusual example of photocyclization in DAEs, uncovering the importance of the symmetric feature of LUMO and HOMO around the reactive center for the photocyclization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oligomeric Protein Complexes Formed by Beta Amyloid Peptides and Their Molecular Associates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
RMs stabilize oligomeric A&#946; and facilitate protein complex formation with Zn2&#8314; and TDP&#8208;43. In contrast to bulk solution, where homotypic interactions dominate, the confined environment promotes prolonged interactions of A&#946; with molecular associates, enabling structural investigations using solid&#8208;state NMR.








Abstract
The aggregation and dysregulation of &#946;&#8208;amyloid (A&#946;) peptides are critical factors in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study investigates the use of reverse micelles (RMs) as a nanoscale environment to encapsulate A&#946; peptides and explore their interactions with zinc ions (Zn2&#8314;) and a TDP&#8208;43 variant, both of which are important binding partners of A&#946; peptides closely associated with neurodegenerative diseases. We demonstrate that RMs stabilize A&#946; peptides in their oligomeric form, promoting &#946;&#8208;sheet formation and enabling detailed structural studies using solid&#8208;state NMR. Our findings reveal that Zn2&#8314; induces specific conformational changes in residues E11 and E22 of A&#946; oligomers but not E3, and that the TDP&#8208;43 variant can form stable protein complex with A&#946;40, that persists even after extended incubation and sonication. A systematic comparison of the site&#8208;specific 13C chemical shifts of the A&#946;40 oligomers modulated by the interactions with Zn2&#8314;, A&#946;42, and a TDP&#8208;43 variant, revealed that A&#946;40 predominantly adopts a &#946;1&#8208;loop&#8208;&#946;2 motif. Notably, chemical state changes were mainly observed in the residues within the loop region and the charged residues of the &#946;1 region. In contrast, the hydrophobic residues of the &#946;&#8208;sheet regions were structurally unaltered upon protein complex formation.

         <title>S&#8208;Containing Double Helicenes Featuring Robust Radical Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces two S&#8208;containing double helicenes with robust radical cations. X&#8208;ray crystallography shows twisted conformations matching DFT&#8208;calculated minima. Chemical oxidation of these double helicenes produced &#960;&#8208;conjugated radical cations, which remained stable in solution for weeks. Remarkably, one radical cation salt achieves a room&#8208;temperature electrical conductivity as high as 0.16 S cm&#8722;1 due to the significant &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions.








Abstract
This study introduces two S&#8208;containing double helicenes capable of forming robust radical cations. These compounds were synthesized via the Scholl reaction, which was modulated to an intermediate stage by reducing the amount of oxidant, resulting in a sulfur&#8208;containing [7]helicene. X&#8208;ray crystallography analysis reveals that both S&#8208;containing double helicenes exhibit twisted conformations consistent with the global minima identified through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Upon chemical oxidation with nitrosonium, these double helicenes produced &#960;&#8208;conjugated radical cations, whose radical nature was confirmed using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. These radical cations remained stable in solution when exposed to air for several weeks, as monitored with absorption spectroscopy. One of the double helicenes forms &#960;&#8208;stacked columns in the crystals of both neutral molecule and radical cation salt. The radical cation hexafluoroantimonate salt exhibits a room&#8208;temperature conductivity of up to 0.16 S cm&#8722;1, attributed to the significant &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions observed in its crystal structure. This study indicates the potential of double helical &#960;&#8208;skeletons as a versatile platform for developing resilient &#960;&#8208;conjugated radical cations without compromising &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, with potential applications in organic electronics.

         <title>Balancing Antigen Loading on Gold Nanoparticles: Implications for Future Cancer Vaccine Strategies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of multicomponent cancer vaccines on AuNP carriers could be rationalized by the simultaneous functionalization of the antigen and immunomodulator components on the same particles. Immunization with a &#8220;diluted&#8221; amount of MUC1&#8208;functionalized AuNPs is still capable of eliciting a strong immune response. Immunohistochemical studies of breast cancer tissue showed that the elicited antibodies were specifically directed against tumour&#8208;associated MUC1&#8208;expressing cells and promoted antibody&#8208;dependent cell&#8208;mediated cytotoxicity.








Abstract
Mucin 1 (MUC1) is a promising antigen for cancer vaccine development, but its low immunogenicity poses a major challenge. In this study, we have investigated the effect of varying the surface density of an artificial MUC1 glycopeptide on gold nanoparticles by co&#8208;loading them with an ovalbumin&#8208;derived peptide. Our results show that reducing the density of the MUC1 antigen on the nanoparticles does not affect the elicited immune response, as high IgG antibody levels were observed in the immunized mice, which were comparable to those obtained with higher antigen loading. These antibodies effectively reacted with natural MUC1 expressed on breast cancer cells, promoted antibody&#8208;dependent cell&#8208;mediated cytotoxicity and specifically recognized cancer tissue in immunohistochemical assays. This work could form the basis for the development of AuNP&#8208;based multicomponent vaccines that will allow the incorporation of additional immunostimulatory or complementary antigens in the future without compromising the efficacy of the MUC1 antigen.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The difluoromethylene (CF&#8322;) group, valued for its unique electronic and steric properties, plays a critical role in pharmaceutical and agrochemical design, as exemplified by drugs like Lubiprostone, which requires ethyl 2,2&#8208;difluorohexanoate as a key intermediate for its synthesis. Consequently, developing efficient methods to incorporate the ethoxycarbonyldifluoromethyl group into alkanes is highly desirable. Herein, we describe a mild, versatile, and efficient radical hydro&#8208;ethoxycarbonyldifluoromethylation of alkenes with BrCF2CO2Et. This process is applicable to both unactivated alkyl alkenes and active aryl alkenes. The protocol is characterized by mild reaction conditions, the absence of expensive reagents, and the elimination of transition metals.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Helical Metallocryptand for Size&#8208;Selective Recognition of Amino Acid Derivatives with Aliphatic Side Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel tris(salen)&#8208;type metallocryptand, LNi3, was synthesized, which was found to exist as a pair of P/M helical enantiomers. This LNi3 selectively recognized various amino acid derivatives via non&#8208;covalent interactions, showing a selectivity to those bearing an aliphatic side chain. The LNi3 metallocryptand also exhibited unique P/M helix inversion preferences depending on the guest side chains, offering potential applications in biochemical sensing and enantioselective detection.








Abstract
The novel tris(salen)&#8208;type metallocryptand, LNi3, was designed and synthesized. Its crystallographic analysis revealed the presence as a helical enantiomeric pair, right&#8208;handed (P) and left&#8208;handed (M) forms, rather than the meso form, which was energetically supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This LNi3 host was capable of recognizing amino acid derivatives by several non&#8208;covalent interactions, showing a selectivity to those bearing an aliphatic side chain. Its shape&#8208;persistent nature of the cryptand facilitated the size&#8208;based discrimination, which was clearly demonstrated by 1H NMR spectroscopic titration studies. Recognition of some of the guests caused the emergence of CD signals, indicating the biased P/M helix inversion equilibrium of LNi3. Three aliphatic side&#8208;chain guests, Val, Ile, and Leu, caused an M&#8208;favored shifting, while two &#960;&#8208;containing side&#8208;chain guests, Arg and Trp, showed a preference to the P form. This metallocryptand, LNi3, overcomes the limitation in recognition of less polar amino acids having an alkyl side chain and provides future applications in molecular recognition, biochemical sensing, and enantiomeric sensing.

         <title>Coordination&#8208;Controlled Synthesis of Aluminum Nanoparticles: Insights from AlH3&#183;(NMP)x Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
AlH3&#183;(NMP)x complexes with varying coordination numbers were synthesized. AlH3&#183;(NMP)1.0 single crystals were isolated from AlH3&#183;(NMP)x mixtures, and successfully elucidated the structure of AlH3&#183;(NMP)1.0 through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The coordination number of AlH3&#183;(NMP)x modulates the morphology of Al nanoparticles. AlH3&#183;(NMP)1.0 exhibited the fastest decomposition rate, yielding highly monodisperse Aluminum nanoparticles (Al NPs) with well&#8208;defined shapes and the narrowest size distribution.








Abstract
The controlled chemical synthesis of aluminum nanocrystals (Al NCs) is crucial for their applications in plasmonics, photocatalysis, and optoelectronics. However, there is still a lack of correlation between the precursor of Al hydride N&#8208;methylpyrrolidine (AlH3&#183;(NMP)x) and the Al NC synthesis outcomes. Here, we report the synthesis of AlH3&#183;(NMP)x complexes with different coordination numbers (x from 1.0 to 2.0) and their characterization as precursors regulating the morphology of Al NCs. We isolated AlH3&#183;(NMP)1.0 single crystals from AlH3&#183;(NMP)x mixtures and successfully elucidated the structure of AlH3&#183;(NMP)1.0 through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Importantly, AlH3&#183;(NMP)1.0 exhibited the fastest decomposition rate, yielding highly monodisperse Al NCs with well&#8208;defined shapes and the narrowest size distribution, while higher coordination numbers led to increased dispersity in size and irregular morphologies. Additionally, we observed distinct multipole plasmonic resonances in Al NCs synthesized from lower coordination number precursors, highlighting their superior optical properties. This work establishes a direct correlation between precursor coordination chemistry and Al NC synthesis outcomes, providing a foundation for optimizing nanoparticle production for advanced material applications.

         <title>Enhanced Polysulfide Regulation in Rechargeable Li&#8211;S Batteries with ZnS as Electrocatalyst: Experimental Validation and Interfacial Insights from Simulations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ZnS&#8208;decorated reduced graphene oxide (rGO@ZnS) composite has been developed as a multifunctional host for the sulfur cathode in rechargeable Li&#8211;S batteries. The host exhibits excellent polysulfides adsorption and catalytic conversion during the battery cycling. The experimental results are verified with molecular dynamics simulations, revealing the role of ZnS in accelerating polysulfide conversion kinetics.








Abstract
We present a high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery cathode based on a reduced graphene oxide (rGO)&#8208;decorated ZnS nanosphere structure, which serves as a multifunctional sulfur host. The rGO framework provides a high&#8208;surface&#8208;area conductive network for enhanced sulfur loading, while ZnS acts as an electrocatalyst to accelerate polysulfide conversion. Fabricated via a one&#8208;step hydrothermal method, the composite achieves a high sulfur content (&#8764;80%) with efficient polysulfide confinement and catalytic conversion as an Li&#8211;S battery cathode. As a result, it delivers an initial capacity of 1014 mAh/g at 0.1 C and retains 592 mAh/g at 1C, demonstrating excellent rate capability and cycling stability (479 mAh/g over 200 cycles at 1C). To further understand the interfacial interactions, molecular dynamics simulations were conducted, revealing the role of ZnS in accelerating lithium polysulfide (LiPS) conversion, particularly from Li&#8322;S&#8324; to Li&#8322;S. The study analyzed LiPS diffusion coefficients and potential energy across different sulfur species, confirming the superior efficiency of the rGO@ZnS host. These findings highlight the potential of ZnS&#8208;decorated rGO structures as a promising approach to improving Li&#8211;S battery performance through enhanced sulfur utilization and polysulfide regulation.

         <title>Modulating Peptide Self&#8208;Assembly via Triblock Chiral Patterning</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral block patterning influences peptide self&#8208;assembly by directing molecular orientation, which results in distinct morphologies and packing configurations. This alters the gel's mechanical properties, thereby impacting its applications in tissue engineering and drug delivery. Our research shows that integrating chiral motifs can modify peptide nanostructures, providing flexible strategies for tailoring functional biomaterials.








Abstract
The suprastructural integrity of peptide self&#8208;assemblies is driven by an intricate array of cohesive interactions that guide and maintain a hierarchical order. Seemingly minor alterations to atomic arrangement, such as substitution with D&#8208;amino acids, can dramatically affect assembly potential and resultant architecture. When a primary sequence is comprised of consecutive identical motifs, &#8220;block heterochiral&#8221; peptides can be generated by partitioning chiral inversions according to these underlying elementary units. In this work, we present a combinatorial exploration of all triblock chiral patterns for the model &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;forming peptide KFE12 (Ac&#8208;(FKFE)3&#8208;NH2). Analysis of the four resulting enantiomer pairs reveals that each produces a unique morphology, ranging from minimal 4&#8208;nm&#8208;wide fibrils to micron&#8208;scale semi&#8208;structured aggregates. Our investigation of these variants illustrates a combination of conserved and divergent hierarchical features, reflecting complex interplay between persistent fundamental forces and the unique spatial implications of blockwise intramolecular chiral interfaces.

         <title>Valence Electron Dependent Contraction Of P6 Ring &#160;In [(CpM)2(&#956;,&#951;6:&#951;6&#8208;P6)] (M=V, Mo): A DFT Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The P6 ring in [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;6:&#951;6&#8208;P6)] contracts to the P5 complex [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;5:&#951;5&#8208;P5)][(MeNHC)2P] by MeNHC. In contrast P6 ring in [(Cp*V)2(&#956;,&#951;6:&#951;6&#8208;P6)] contracts to P5 and P4 complexes [(Cp*V)2(&#956;,&#951;5:&#951;5&#8208;P5)][(MeNHC)2P] and [(Cp*V)2(&#956;,&#951;4:&#951;4&#8208;P4MeNHC)]. In addition, an anionic form of the precursor [(Cp*V)2(&#956;,&#951;6:&#951;6&#8208;P6)][(MeNHC)2P] is also produced here. Mechanistic investigation using TPSSh&#8208;d4/Def2&#8208;TZVP method shows the importance of different spin states in the reaction and a possible outer sphere electron transfer aiding the ring contraction of P5 to P4.

In contrast P6 ring in [(Cp*V)2(&#956;,&#951;6:&#951;6-P6)] contracts to P5 and P4 complexes [(Cp*V)2(&#956;,&#951;5:&#951;5-P5)][(MeNHC)2P] and [(Cp*V)2(&#956;,&#951;4:&#951;4-P4MeNHC)]. In addition, an anionic form of the precursor [(Cp*V)2(&#956;,&#951;6:&#951;6-P6)][(MeNHC)2P] is also produced here. Mechanistic investigation using TPSSh-d4/Def2-TZVP method shows the importance of different spin states in the reaction and a possible outer sphere electron transfer aiding the ring contraction of P5 to P4.

         <title>Reactivity of &#948;&#8208;Functionalized para&#8208;Quinone Methides in Nucleophilic Addition Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrophilic reactivities of para&#8208;quinone methides (pQMs) with functional groups at the exocyclic polarized carbon&#8208;carbon double bond were determined by photometrical monitoring the kinetics of their reactions with carbanions in DMSO at 20&#176;C. The experimental second&#8208;order rate constants k2 were evaluated by the Mayr&#8208;Patz equation, that is, the linear free energy relationship lg k2 = sN(N + E), which was leveraged to determine the electrophilicity descriptors E of the pQMs. These electrophilicity parameters E were subsequently used to successfully predict the scope of the pQM reactions with C&#8208;, H&#8208;, N&#8208;, O&#8208; and S&#8208;centered nucleophiles. Moreover, the electrophilicity parameters E correlate linearly with a linear combination of quantum&#8208;chemically calculated methyl anion affinities (MAAs) and buried volumes (%Vbur). While MAA values mainly reflect the thermodynamic driving force of the carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation, %Vbur values take account of the variable steric effects of substituents at the electrophilic &#948;&#8208;position of the pQMs. Knowledge of MAA and %Vbur thus enables chemists to tailor novel pQMs with predictable reactivity properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrodeposition of PTCTA/ZnO Composite Films for Acetic Acid Vapor Detection at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents PTCTA/ZnO composite films for efficient room&#8208;temperature acetic acid sensing. The enhanced sensing capability was attributed to the synergistic effects of the formation of p&#8208;n heterojunction effect and the porous structure of PTCTA/ZnO composite.








Abstract
Metal oxide semiconductor sensors based on zinc oxide (ZnO) and its composites are found to be very sensitive in detecting acetic acid vapor. However, its operating temperatures usually exceed 200&#160;&#176;C. In this work, an environmentally friendly and controllable electrochemical approach for constructing poly(4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;&#8208;Tris(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;triphenylamine) (PTCTA) and ZnO composite films was successfully obtained for acetic acid sensing at room temperature. The conjugated microporous polymer (CMP) films of PTCTA were synthesized via an electropolymerization (EP) method using 4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;&#8208;Tris(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;triphenylamine (TCTA) molecule as a precursor. Subsequently, ZnO was deposited in situ to fabricate homogeneous PTCTA/ZnO composite films. The resulting PTCTA/ZnO composite films achieved a response value of 2.42 for 200&#160;ppm acetic acid vapor at room temperature, which was significantly outperforming standalone PTCTA or ZnO films. This enhanced sensing capability was attributed to the porous structure, the synergistic effects of the p&#8208;n heterojunction at the PTCTA/ZnO interface and the oxygen adsorption/desorption occurring on the ZnO surface. What's more, PTCTA/ZnO composite films demonstrated structural stability and flexibility. The results suggested that the developed novel PTCTA/ZnO composite films showed great potential for acetic acid determination.

         <title>Convergent approach towards ADP&#8208;ribosylated&#8208;peptides via a chemoselective phosphate condensation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The preparation of well&#8208;defined ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides is essential for studying the functional implications of this post&#8208;translational modification. While methodologies exist for the chemical synthesis of short oligo&#8208;ADPr fragments and mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides separately, combining the two distinct chemistries, required to assemble them, has remained challenging. In this research, we employ a methodology for the regio&#8208; and chemoselective condensation of two phosphomonoesters to convergently install the pyrophosphate bond in ADP&#8208;ribosylated constructs. A diverse set of phosphoribosylated peptides, varying in the amino acid acceptor, were prepared and condensed with adenosine monophosphate to yield mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides. Furthermore, a solid&#8208;phase approach was developed to access a phosphoadenosyl&#8208;ADPr fragment, which was used to prepare a di&#8208;ADPr&#8208;peptide as the first example of a synthetic oligo&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptide. Overall, the work presented here extends synthetic methodology for the preparation of well&#8208;defined ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Importance of Balancing the pKa of the Additive in &#946;&#8208;Ketoenamine COF Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the irreversible tautomerization of imine linkages to their corresponding ketoenamines, &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) are a stable type of COF that displays high surface areas. In the solvothermal synthesis of such COFs, the use of (acetic) acid is ubiquitous. However, the effect of the added acid on the COF properties (notably their surface area) has never been investigated. Building on an extensive literature overview, we systematically studied the effect of the pKa of several added acids on COF performance characteristics, and extended the investigation by including a series of (organo&#8208;)bases with varying pKa. Interestingly, the highest BET surface areas, above 1400 m2/g, were found in the alkaline region of the pKa window, with a maximum near pKa ~10.8 for triethylamine and N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine. Considering the pKa values related to the three phenolic hydroxyl groups of 2,4,6&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol, one of the COF building blocks, these organobases fully deprotonate two of these hydroxyl groups and partly deprotonate the third one, which will optimize the reaction rate of the &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine bond formation, explaining the improved COF crystallinity and associated microporosity. The largely overlooked use of organobases in the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked COFs thus offers a promising approach to improve the COF performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Aggregation, Photoluminescence, and Cytotoxicity of Pt(II) and Re(I) Complexes Bearing Multimodal&#8208;Coordinating Luminophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polydentate ligand with multiple coordination patterns (bidentate N*N&#8208;mode for Pt(II) and Re(I) centers, tridentate C^N*N&#8208;motive for Pt(II)&#8208;based complexes) is herein presented. The attained coordination&#8208;chemical versatility in combination with different co&#8208;ligands was employed to achieve sophisticated structural features and tunable photophysical properties, including&#160;aggregation and cytotoxicity.








Abstract
In this study, a polydentate ligand capable of adopting multiple coordination modes (N*N, C^N*N, and C^N*N^C) was established. Depending on the chelation conditions and the co&#8208;ligand used in the subsequent steps, nine complexes became accessible. The four Pt(II)&#8208;based species with N*N&#8208;coordination motif show tunable emission and cytotoxicity. Two Pt(II) complexes with C^N*N&#8208;type coordination were also obtained, and the exchange of the co&#8208;ligand from chlorido to cyanido led to an enhancement in the photoluminescence quantum yield from &lt;0.02 to 0.55. These compounds exhibit distinct solid&#8208;state characteristics associated with Pt&#8943;Pt&#8208;interactions. Interestingly, the tetradentate C^N*N^C&#8208;coordination mode was not accessible, most likely due to kinetic reasons and insolubility&#8208;related purification hurdles. However, the use of a N*N&#8208;coordination mode for a Re(I) center yielded non&#8208;cytotoxic 3MLCT&#8208;state emitters. The multifaceted coordination modes available with the luminophoric ligand enable the design and realization of diverse metal complexes with tailored cytotoxicity and tendency towards intermolecular coupling, both in solution and in crystalline phases.

         <title>Effect of the Entanglement of Microporous Pillared MOFs on the Uptake and Release Profiles of Essential Oil Components</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two differently entangled pillared MOFs with similar chemical compositions but different flexibility were compared for their guest uptake/release capacity. The flexible interpenetrated MOF shows superior host&#8208;guest propensity with respect to the polycatenated one.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of coordination polymers known for their intrinsic porosity. This property, combined with their ability to exhibit some degree of flexibility, makes them ideal materials for various innovative applications, like the inclusion and controlled release of active compounds for active packaging and agricultural applications. This study aimed to characterize the uptake and release behavior of an equimolar mixture of two phenolic essential oils (EOs), that is, carvacrol (CAR) and thymol (THY), encapsulated in two microporous Zn&#8208;based MOFs with different entanglement motifs: PUM168 is threefold interpenetrated and flexible, while PUM210 is fourfold polycatenated and rigid (PUM = Parma University Materials). The guest uptake was calculated using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) analysis, whereas the release profiles were investigated via headspace gas chromatography&#8208;mass spectrometry (HS&#8208;GC&#8208;MS) (Headspace&#8208;Gas Chromatography coupled with Mass&#8208;Spectrometry) analysis over a period of 15 days at room temperature. The monitoring revealed the superior ability of the flexible PUM168 for a stable and prolonged release of the volatile components, while the release from the rigid PUM210 was completed within 24 hours.

         <title>Small Molecule Donor/Polymer Acceptor Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency of 13.65% Enabled by Film Formation Kinetics and Phase Separation Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on small molecular donor and polymer acceptor (SD/PA&#8208;type) show low photovoltaic performance due to the unideal morphology. However, previous work mainly focus on the aspects of donors, but how the polymer acceptor influences its morphology and device performances is lack of study. In this work, we apply three polymerized non&#8208;fullerene small molecules as acceptors, combining film forming kinetics and microstructure characterization to investigate the efficient SD/PA&#8208;type OSCs requirements on polymers. We found the following two results: Strong miscibility between donor and acceptor would facilitate the acceptor induce the donor to adopt a face&#8208;on packing; under the similar miscibility, the inferior crystallinity of acceptor facilitates a more proper phase separation. Hence, the DTBDT&#8208;C3&#8208;D6:PY2S&#8208;F&#8208;based SD/PA&#8208;type OSCs with the best miscibility achieves an impressive PCE of 13.65% with both high short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) of 20.73 mA cm&#8208;2&#160;and fill factor (FF) of 72.93%, which are among the highest values in the reported binary SD/PA&#8208;type OSCs so far. Our work provides a new perspective for the development of highly efficient SD/PA&#8208;type OSCs with polymer acceptor matched to small molecule donor.</dc:description>

         <title>Secondary Donor Engineering for High&#8208;Efficiency Orange&#8208;Red Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Secondary donor positional engineering at the C2 and C3 positions of a NAI&#8211;DMAc core yields efficient orange&#8209;red TADF emitters. The C3&#8209;isomer ND37DBT exhibits enhanced spin orbit coupling and RISC processes, achieving 70% PLQY. and 22.1% EQE in solution&#8209;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs).








Abstract
Achieving efficient orange&#8208;red emission in thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters remains challenging due to the hard to achieve great balance between a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap and high radiative decay rates. In this study, a modification site engineering strategy for secondary donors to optimize excited&#8208;state properties for orange&#8208;red emitters is proposed. Two isomeric emitters, ND28DBT and ND37DBT, were synthesized by introducing dibenzothiophene (DBT) units at different positions of a naphthalimide&#8211;dimethylacridine (NAI&#8211;DMAc) core. The theoretical analysis indicates that ND37DBT possesses a more favorable excited&#8208;state configuration, which facilitates an efficient reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process and accelerates the radiative decay rate. As a result, ND37DBT showed a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) (70%), a fast RISC rate (6.25&#160;&#215;&#160;105 s&#8722;1), and an excellent external quantum efficiency (EQE) (22.1%) with minimal roll&#8208;off in 100 cd m&#8722;2. This work demonstrates that precise control of secondary donor modification sites offers a powerful molecular design strategy for developing high&#8208;efficiency orange&#8208;red TADF materials.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of Triphosphaallyl Cation Stabilized by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>

Imidazoliumyl&#8208;substituted triphosphaallyl cations undergo selective P&#8211;C bond cleavage and form unprecedented bicyclic P&#8323;&#8208;Ga scaffolds with unique reactivity.









Abstract
Reduction of the triphosphaallyl species 6[GaCl4] with GaI[Ga2Cl7] affords the imidazoliumyl&#8208;substituted (L) bicyclo[2.1.1]&#8208;triphosphane 10[Ga2Cl7], featuring an unprecedented Ga2Cl5&#8208;bridged P3 scaffold. Reactions of 10[Ga2Cl7] with nucleophiles (Cl&#8722; or NHC) result in rare, selective P&#8211;C bond cleavages, affording Ga2Cly&#8208;substituted triphosphiranes (LP3Ga2Cly, y = &#160;5, 6) via an intramolecular ring closure mechanism. Protonation of 6[GaCl4] gives rise to a similar ring closure, but without P&#8211;C bond cleavage, to afford the L2P3H+ salt 8[OTfGaCl3]2. Additionally, the palladium complex 26[GaCl4], formed through the reaction of 10[Ga2Cl7] with [Pd(PPh3)4], presents a novel bicyclic P3Pd moiety (LP3Pd(PPh3)2[GaCl4]). Comprehensive DFT calculations have been conducted to elucidate the bonding situation in 26[GaCl4], uncovering significant metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand &#960;&#8208;back&#8208;donation and a distinctive 3&#8208;center&#8208;4&#8208;electron hyperbonding phenomenon in the P&#8323;Pd framework. These findings offer valuable insights into chemistry of cyclic polyphosphorus compounds and, in particular, the reactivity, structural flexibility, and the coordination properties of cationic triphosphorus species.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Vibration and Liquefaction of Flexible and Naturally Bent Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single crystals obtained by cocrystallization of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;azopyridine and long&#8208;chain fatty acids exhibit versatile stimuli&#8208;responsive properties: UV&#8208;induced rapid vibration, temporary photoliquefaction, and mechanical deformation. These remarkable photo&#8208;responsive properties arise from photoisomerization and photothermal effects, whereas flexible molecular packing enabled by long alkyl chains imparts deformability.








Abstract
Single crystals obtained by cocrystallization of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;azopyridine with long&#8208;chain fatty acids, viz. lauric acid, myristic acid, and palmitic acid, exhibit a variety of light&#8208;responsive properties. The molecular arrangement of the cocrystal components in the crystal structure, coupled with the flexibility of the long alkyl chains and the presence of the azo group, enables the elastic and plastically deformable crystals to demonstrate light responsiveness, which manifests as bending, vibration, and liquefaction. The photoresponses arise from two primary mechanisms: the photoisomerization of azopyridine groups within the crystal lattice and the photothermal effect that generates localized heat under UV light. Consequently, the single crystals display reversible bending and vibrational motion in response to on/off light cycles, as well as temporary liquefaction of the crystalline materials when exposed to higher&#8208;intensity UV light. The arrangement of the long alkyl chains and the presence of weak interactions within the crystal structure impart deformability to the single crystals while lowering melting points. This work illustrates how adaptive crystalline materials can be developed by modulating the crystal structure of light&#8208;sensitive molecular components through non&#8208;covalent synthesis.

         <title>Oxidative Dehydrogenation of N&#8208;Heteroaromatic Alkyl Alcohols and Amines Facilitated by Dearomative Tautomerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;heteroaromatic alkyl alcohols and amines are inherently unstable in acidic and/or basic solution due to an irreversible dehydrogenation that proceeds from a minority tautomer. In many cases, this reaction results in quantitative oxidation to the corresponding aldehyde, providing a simple, convenient, and green approach for preparing versatile synthetic building blocks.








Abstract
The oxidation of alcohols, amines, and halides is a fundamental transformation in organic chemistry with significant applications in the synthesis of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and natural products. Here we show that a broad variety of N&#8208;heteroarenes bearing hydroxymethyl, aminomethyl, or halomethyl groups are oxidatively dehydrogenated to their respective aldehydes by simply heating them in acidic or basic aqueous solution under ambient atmosphere. The quantitative oxidation of 9&#8208;acridinemethanol to 9&#8208;acridinecarboxaldehyde serves as an illustrative example, proceeding to completion within 3&#160;hours in refluxing 5% aqueous acetic acid or even household vinegar. Quinoline derivatives may be similarly oxidized but require higher temperatures and longer reaction times, while indole derivatives are oxidized under basic conditions. Based on comprehensive regioselectivity screens, internal kinetic isotope competition, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we propose a mechanism in which migration of a methylene hydrogen to the pyridinic nitrogen by acid&#8208;catalyzed dearomative tautomerization yields an unstable enol or enamine intermediate that then irreversibly loses two hydrogen atoms to atmospheric oxygen. In addition to the simplicity and environmentally benign nature of our method, we observe no indication of any over&#8208;oxidation to carboxylic acids. Finally, we demonstrate the synthetic utility of this reaction through two different one&#8208;pot formylations of acridine.

         <title>Effect of Chalcogen Interaction on the Structure of Methine&#8208;Bridged Trichalcogenophenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stereochemistry of methine&#8208;bridged trichalcogenophenes was elucidated through comprehensive structural analyses. Trithiophene showed a strong preference for the ZZ configuration, whereas its trifuran analog exhibited a near&#8208;statistical distribution of geometric isomers. X&#8208;ray crystallography and computational studies revealed that intramolecular S&#183;&#183;&#183;S chalcogen bonding stabilizes the ZZ configuration.








Abstract
Polythienylenemethylidenes (PTMs) are promising conjugated polymers for organic electronics owing to their narrow bandgaps and extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation. However, their stereochemistry remains unexplored. In this study, methine&#8208;bridged trithiophene and trifuran analogs were synthesized to investigate stereochemistry and chalcogen bonding effects. The compounds were obtained as mixtures of ZZ, EZ(= ZE), and EE geometric isomers, established through detailed NMR analyses. At thermal equilibrium, the ZZ isomer predominated in trithiophene (ZZ:(EZ&#160;+&#160;ZE):EE&#160;=&#160;58:35:6), whereas trifuran showed a near&#8208;statistical distribution. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed intramolecular S&#183;&#183;&#183;S chalcogen bonding in trithiophene with S&#183;&#183;&#183;S distances (&#8776;3.04 &#197;) shorter than van der Waals radii and C&#8211;S&#183;&#183;&#183;S angles of 171&#176;. Comprehensive conformer searches and DFT calculations not only validated the higher stability of the ZZ isomer in trithiophene but also provided calculated isomer distributions that closely matched the experimental values. Multi&#8208;faceted computational analysis (electron localization function (ELF), noncovalent interaction (NCI), quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM), and natural bond orbital (NBO))&#160;confirmed the presence of these chalcogen&#8208;centered interactions and quantified their strength through lone pair (LP)(S)&#8594;&#963;*(S&#8211;C) donor&#8208;acceptor orbital interactions. Trithiophene exhibited a unique dual&#8208;chalcogen bonding mode in the ZZ configuration. These findings elucidate the role of chalcogen bonding in stabilizing ZZ&#8208;trithiophenes and contribute to designing PTMs with controlled stereochemistry for organic electronics applications.

         <title>Divergent Responses of Carbon Nitride Dot&#8208;Based Amorphous Species and Small Molecule Hybrids to Trace Level Analytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a bottom&#8208;up synthesis method using hydrothermal reaction of CA and U to produce CNDs with controllable properties. The approach yields two distinct fractions: polycrystalline small&#8208;molecule hybrids and amorphous CNDs. The research investigates how these different species affect explosive detection capabilities, providing insights for optimizing sensing applications through controlled synthesis conditions.








Abstract
Bottom&#8208;up synthesis of carbon nitride dots (CNDs) offers a versatile platform for the creation of diverse nanomaterials with tunable properties. Here, we report a facile hydrothermal approach using citric acid (CA) and urea (U) as precursors to synthesize CNDs with varying degrees of condensation and crystallinity. By carefully controlling reaction conditions and post&#8208;synthetic treatments, we obtained two distinct fractions: a polycrystalline fraction composed of small&#8208;molecule hybrids and an amorphous fraction containing CNDs. We then sought to understand how the dominant species in these fractions impact sensing abilities using trace&#8208;level explosive exemplars. The results have important implications for sensing and related applications where understanding the complex interplay between synthetic conditions and post&#8208;synthetic processing play vital roles in determining the final properties of CND materials.

         <title>Review of Metal Nitrides for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries: Design, Mechanisms, and Prospects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The article explores the performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries enhanced by metal nitrides, detailing the synthesis methods, morphological characteristics, and size&#8208;dependent effects. It also discusses underlying design principles for metal nitrides and outlines future directions for their application in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSB) emerge as the next generation battery technology owing to their high theoretical capacity and energy density. However, sluggish redox reactions coupled with severe volume alterations result in underachievement of the merits. Additionally, the atrocious shuttle effect prompts premature failure, thereby limiting life cycle count. Transition metal nitrides with excellent properties, including good electrical conductivity and catalytic effects, have been investigated as functional materials to address the challenges of LSB. Mainly, transition metal nitrides as well as their composites have been employed as hosts and interlayers to boost reaction kinetics and enhance the cycle life. This review focuses on the fundamental mechanisms of metal nitrides toward the capture and catalysis of polysulfides. The article highlights battery performance attained with key metal nitrides with the inclusion of the synthesis procedures, morphology, and size effects. Further, the possible principles for the design of metal nitrides, along with future directions, are discussed.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSB) emerge as the next generation battery technology owing to their high theoretical capacity and energy density. However, sluggish redox reactions coupled with severe volume alterations result in underachievement of the merits. Additionally, the atrocious shuttle effect prompts premature failure, thereby limiting life cycle count. Transition metal nitrides with excellent properties, including good electrical conductivity and catalytic effects, have been investigated as functional materials to address the challenges of LSB. Mainly, transition metal nitrides as well as their composites have been employed as hosts and interlayers to boost reaction kinetics and enhance the cycle life. This review focuses on the fundamental mechanisms of metal nitrides toward the capture and catalysis of polysulfides. The article highlights battery performance attained with key metal nitrides with the inclusion of the synthesis procedures, morphology, and size effects. Further, the possible principles for the design of metal nitrides, along with future directions, are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cyanomethylation of Aldehydes on an Electrochemical Microflow System and Utility of Machine Learning&#8208;Assisted Examination of the Reaction Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical cyanomethylation reaction was developed. Using the electrochemical microflow reactor enables the reaction to yield almost exclusively products. To find the best reaction conditions, we used the Gaussian process regression (GPR), and the flow rates and the current values were explored. Our cyanomethylation was completed with a semi&#8208;catalytic electrical input, and the mechanism was discussed based on cyclic voltammetry (CV) and DFT calculations.








Abstract
Cyanomethylation of carbonyl compounds affords a &#946;&#8208;hydroxy nitrile, which is very useful in the field of synthetic organic chemistry. Although several electrochemical methods have also been reported to achieve cyanomethylation of carbonyl compounds, dehydration as a major side reaction is a significant issue that needs to be prevented. An electrochemical flow reactor, free from side reactions through rapid removal of the reaction solution from the electrode surface, enables the electrochemical cyanomethylation of aldehydes in acetonitrile without any dehydrated side products. To find the &#8220;best&#8221; reaction conditions for each starting material, we used machine learning (ML) models. In addition, comparing the ML models constructed using various molecular descriptors contributed to understanding the critical molecular properties to proceed the electrochemical cyanomethylation. Our cyanomethylation using a flow system went to completion with a semi&#8208;catalytic amount of electrical input, which is not consistent with the conventional basic mechanism, and DFT calculations suggest a radical mechanism.

         <title>Perspectives of Soft Lattice Halide Perovskite Photocatalysts, Mechanisms and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have shown significant promise in the realm of photocatalysis due to their distinctive optical and electrical properties. In this Perspective, we review the latest advancements in MHPs for photocatalysis, summarizing common modification methods aimed at enhancing photocatalytic efficiency and stability. We then highlight the changes in lattice and band structures exhibited by MHPs before and after photoexcitation, with a particular focus on the intricate and varied transformations observed in LFPMs. By emphasizing the importance of these lattice and band changes, we demonstrate how they can be leveraged to construct effective heterostructures and rationally design and synthesize novel perovskite materials with robust photocatalytic capabilities. We hope that this Perspective can offer researchers new insights into MHPs photocatalysis and advance the application of LFPMs in the field of photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Folding of Azobenzene Derivatives with Axial Chirality and Chirality Inversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding of photoisomerism effect on the chiral transportation occurred intra&#8208; and intermolecularly shall facilitates the fabrication of smart chiroptical materials for sensing, recognition and display. Here we present the photoisomerization enabled molecular folding and chirality transportation. Azobenzene core is conjugated with two chiral arms comprising of amino acid segments. The substituted position including ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;positioned substituents affects the formation of intramolecular interactions, leading to distinct adaptiveness towards the solvent media. The trans&#8208;cis isomerism of azobenzene allows for the reversible manipulation of chiroptical properties, accompanied by the appearance of axial chirality. The ortho&#8208;substituted azobenzene can form folded structures stabilized by intramolecular CH&#8208;&#960; interactions in trans&#8208;form, while in the cis&#8208;form, the conformation is stabilized by the hydrogen bonds between the oxygen atom and the hydrogen attached to the nitrogen in the amide segment. Structural transformations induced by solvent and light irradiation were revealed through density&#8208;functional theory (DFT)&#8208;based computational studies and experimental results. This work unveils the photoisomerization effect on folding, and achieves reversible conformational changes and chirality inversion, showing potential for constructing advanced smart chiroptical materials.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Stabilized Bisacylgermylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this contribution, a metal&#8208;free synthetic approach towards isolable bisacylgermylenes, a novel class of germylenes, is described. Starting from tetra(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzoyl)germane 1 and bromo&#8208;tris(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzoyl)germane 3, we demonstrate that simple treatment with NHCs leads to two distinct types of reactivity: acyl abstraction and germylene stabilization. Reaction of 1 with NHCs produces imidazolium&#8208;substituted germenolates 2a,b via a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mechanism. In contrast, compound 3 undergoes stepwise substitution to afford isolable NHC&#8208;stabilized bisacylgermylenes 4a,b, which were structurally characterized by NMR and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The UV/Vis spectra of 4a,b shows two absorption bands in the visible region of the light, which do not overlap and have different characters. Reactivity studies revealed its nucleophilic character and resulted in the formation of several germylene/iron and germylene/boron complexes. The removal of the NHC at room temperature with triphenylborane leads to a degradation, mainly based on the instability of the unstabilized bisacylgermylene. To determine its reactivity, an alternative synthetic strategy was developed based on the reaction of the geminal bisgermenolates 7 with the bischloro&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzoyl)&#8208;germane 9. Trapping reactions with NHCs results in the formation of 4a,b in near quantitative yields. This work expands the synthetic scope of main group low&#8208;valent chemistry and introduces germylenes with tunable reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Acid&#8208;Controlled Divergent Radical Cyclization of 1,6&#8208;Enynes to Access 1&#8208;Indanones and 1H&#8208;Cyclopropa[b] Naphthalene&#8208;2,7&#8208;diones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radical cyclization reaction of 1,6&#8208;enynes using Cu(I) as the catalyst and 4&#8208;methylbenzoic acid as the cocatalyst has been used to access 1&#8208;Indanone derivatives. There are some advantages to the reaction such as available materials, simple operation, and compatibility with a wide range of substituents. Notably, in the absence of 4&#8208;methylbenzoic acid, the reaction undergoes a dramatic shift in product selectivity, yielding 1H&#8209;cyclopropa[b] naphthalene&#8208;2,7&#8208;diones exclusively under the same conditions, with Cu(I) acting as the sole catalyst.








Abstract
1&#8208;Indanone derivatives are efficiently synthesized via a radical cyclization reaction of 1,6&#8208;enynes, using TBHP as both oxidant and reactant, in the presence of Cu(I) as the catalyst and 4&#8208;methyl benzoic acid as the cocatalyst. Notably, in the absence of 4&#8208;methyl benzoic acid, the reaction undergoes a dramatic shift in product selectivity, yielding 1H&#8209;cyclopropa[b]naphthalene&#8208;2,7&#8208;diones exclusively under the same conditions, with Cu(I) acting as the sole catalyst. This transformation offers key advantages, including operational simplicity, cost&#8208;effective and readily available materials, scalability to gram quantities, and compatibility with a wide range of functional groups.

&lt;p&gt;A radical cyclization reaction of 1,6-enynes using Cu(I) as the catalyst and 4-methylbenzoic acid as the cocatalyst has been used to access 1-Indanone derivatives. There are some advantages to the reaction such as available materials, simple operation, and compatibility with a wide range of substituents. Notably, in the absence of 4-methylbenzoic acid, the reaction undergoes a dramatic shift in product selectivity, yielding 1H&#8209;cyclopropa[&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;] naphthalene-2,7-diones exclusively under the same conditions, with Cu(I) acting as the sole catalyst.

         <title>Grafted Disulfide&#8208;Linked Linear Polymers for Heterogeneous Thiyl Radical Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Grafting a linear disulfide&#8208;bridged polymer to a supporting polymer backbone achieved heterogeneous thiyl radical photocatalysis. The polyvinyl backbone ensures recyclability while enabling thiyl radical generation for organic transformations. Achieving &#8764;99% conversion for diarylalkyne photooxidation, the design strategy combines robustness, solubility, and reusability, advancing thiyl radical catalysis for sustainable applications.








Abstract
Dynamic disulfide bonds offer a promising avenue for developing robust and reversible photocatalysts. This study introduces a novel polymer, Poly&#8208;SS, designed for heterogeneous thiyl radical photocatalysis, leveraging the dynamic nature of disulfide linkages. Poly&#8208;SS features linear disulfide&#8208;containing polymers grafted onto a polyvinyl backbone, combining the photoactivity of disulfide with the structural integrity of polyvinyl. This design facilitates efficient thiyl radical generation upon photoirradiation, enabling challenging organic transformations. Poly&#8208;SS demonstrates exceptional photocatalytic efficiency for the aerobic oxidation of diarylalkynes to 1,2&#8208;diketones, achieving&#160;&gt;99% conversion. The polyvinyl backbone plays a crucial role in maintaining polymer recyclability by promoting thiyl radical recombination and preserving disulfide linkages, addressing the inherent lability of molecular thiyl radicals. Furthermore, copolymerization with soluble monomer enhances the solubility of Poly&#8208;SS, enabling facile thin&#8208;film fabrication for diverse photoreactor designs. This work highlights a significant advancement in heterogeneous thiyl radical photocatalysis, showcasing the potential of carefully designed disulfide&#8208;linked polymers to overcome limitations associated with traditional molecular catalysts by integrating dynamic covalent chemistry with a robust polymer architecture.

         <title>Unleashing the Biosensing Potential of 2D Inorganic Nanomaterials: the Journey of a Decade</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D inorganic nanomaterials, including transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), MXenes, black phosphorus (BP) and hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN), have transformed biosensing. Their superior conductivity, extensive surface area and biocompatibility facilitates disease detection and diagnosis. This review underscores recent advancements, focusing on their physicochemical characteristics and biosensing potential in healthcare.








Abstract
With the growing need for rapid, sensitive and accurate point&#8208;of&#8208;care biosensors, 2D nanomaterials have gained significant attention, establishing them as versatile candidates for advanced biomedical applications. Biosensors utilizing 2D nanomaterials enable real&#8208;time disease monitoring, allowing for prompt intervention and therapy, tracking of physiological activities and enhancing the understanding of the human biosystem. Since they are cost&#8208;effective and user&#8208;friendly, 2D nanomaterials have been utilized in commercial biosensors. Over the past decade, graphene and its derivatives have been the most studied 2D nanomaterials, due to their large surface area and tuneable electronic and optical properties, which significantly enhance their sensitivity and specificity. Nevertheless, recently discovered 2D nanomaterials, including MXenes, black phosphorus and hexagonal boron nitride, remain largely unexplored. Despite their numerous applications, the broader potential of these materials in biosensing remains insufficiently explored in current literature. This review offers a comprehensive perspective by specifically focusing on inorganic 2D nanomaterials, an area that remains underrepresented in the literature. It provides an in&#8208;depth overview of their unique physicochemical properties and how these features contribute toward enhancing the performance of biosensors, thereby offering new and valuable insights into their emerging role in advanced biomedical diagnostics.

         <title>Dinuclear Copper Complex with a Pyridazine&#8208;Bridged Octadentate Ligand: Monooxygenase Activity and Characterization of Copper&#8208;Oxygen Intermediates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Access to various copper&#8208;oxygen intermediates: Depending on the reaction conditions, different copper&#8208;oxygen intermediates can be obtained with our new dinuclear complex. Whereas low&#8208;temperature oxygenation leads to a &#956;&#8208;1,1 hydroperoxo complex, oxygenation at room temperature generates a &#8220;green species&#8221; that looks like a mono &#956;&#8208;oxo complex but rather corresponds to a dihydroxo complex. The reactivities of all of these intermediates as well as the &#956;&#8208;hydroxo complex toward hydrocarbons are investigated.








Abstract
Copper&#8208;containing enzymes catalyze the mono&#8208;oxygenation of aromatic and aliphatic substrates in nature. Herein, we report on the synthesis of a new dinuclear copper complex supported by an octadentate ligand with a pyridazine backbone. Low&#8208;temperature oxygenation leads to a &#956;&#8208;1,1&#8208;hydroperoxo dicopper(II) (Cu2OOH) complex, which in turn stoichiometrically converts anthrone (AT) to anthraquinone (AQ). Oxygenation at room temperature, by contrast, leads to a new species that mediates the conversion of AT to AQ in a catalytic fashion, but neither corresponds to a &#956;&#8208;peroxo nor a mono &#956;&#8208;oxo dicopper complex. For further analysis, a &#956;&#8208;hydroxo dicopper(II) (Cu2OH) complex is synthesized by oxidation of the copper(I) complex with AgOTf. The electronic and geometric structures of the Cu2OOH and Cu2OH intermediates, as well as the structure of the room&#8208;temperature oxygenation product are elucidated by UV/Vis, Raman, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and mass spectrometry, coupled to DFT.

         <title>Ligand Mediated Metal&#8208;Metal and Metal&#8208;Ligand Cooperativity in Cesium Coordination Polymers and its Beneficial Role in the ROP of Cyclic Esters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique cesium coordination polymeric networks, a 2D sheet, an infinite ladder chain, and a well&#8208;connected 3D cage were developed by tuning the substituent on iminopyrrolyl architecture. The 2D sheet of cesium polymer was efficiently fragmented into a monomeric complex by employing 18&#8208;Crown&#8208;6. Subsequently, cesium complexes were found to be competent catalysts in the ROP of rac&#8208;lactide and &#949;&#8208;caprolactone.








Abstract
Designing a multimetallic catalyst based on the principle of metalloenzymes has emerged as a promising route to enhance catalytic performance owing to the combined action of different metal centers in a cooperative fashion. The cooperativity of metal centers with the surrounding ligand environment in metalloenzymes plays a crucial role in driving efficient catalysis. However, the replication of such cooperativity in a synthetic system is very challenging. In this work, we report the synthesis and characterization of diverse cesium coordination polymeric networks, a 2D sheet, [Cs{&#954;2&#8208;C4H3N&#8208;2(CH&#160;=&#160;N(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3))}]&#8734; (1), an infinite ladder chain, [Cs{&#954;3&#8208;C4H3N&#8208;2(CH&#160;=&#160;N(CHPh2))}]&#8734; (2), and a 3D cage [Cs2{&#954;3&#8208;(C4H3N&#8208;2(CH&#160;=&#160;NCH2CH2N(CH2CH2)2O))}]&#8734; (3). This was accomplished by a variation of the substituent on the iminopyrrolyl ligand. Moreover, we studied a breakdown of the 2D sheet coordination polymer (1) into contact pair monomeric cesium complex [(18&#8208;Cr&#8208;6)Cs(&#954;2&#8208;C4H3N&#8208;2(CH&#160;=&#160;N(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3)))] (4). In the coordination polymers, multiple Cs centers are held together within a proximal distance (3.5&#8211;6&#160;&#197;) via an iminopyrrolyl ligand. The Cs coordination polymer 2 displays the highest catalytic efficiency in ring opening polymerization of rac&#8208;lactide (ROP), giving a turnover frequency (TOF) value of 49.5 h&#8722;1 compared to 15.7 h&#8722;1 and 24.0 h&#8722;1 for 1 and 3. The higher reactivity of 2 in comparison to 1 and 3 is due to the metal&#8208;metal cooperativity in cesium coordination polymeric networks.

In this work, we report the synthesis and characterization of diverse cesium coordination polymeric networks, a 2D sheet, [Cs{&#954;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N-2(CH&#160;=&#160;N(2,6-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;))}]&lt;sub&gt;&#8734;&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), an infinite ladder chain, [Cs{&#954;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N-2(CH&#160;=&#160;N(CHPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;))}]&lt;sub&gt;&#8734;&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), and a 3D cage [Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{&#954;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-(C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N-2(CH&#160;=&#160;NCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O))}]&lt;sub&gt;&#8734;&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;). This was accomplished by a variation of the substituent on the iminopyrrolyl ligand. Moreover, we studied a breakdown of the 2D sheet coordination polymer (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) into contact pair monomeric cesium complex [(18-Cr-6)Cs(&#954;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N-2(CH&#160;=&#160;N(2,6-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)))] (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;). In the coordination polymers, multiple Cs centers are held together within a proximal distance (3.5&#8211;6&#160;&#197;) via an iminopyrrolyl ligand. The Cs coordination polymer &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; displays the highest catalytic efficiency in ring opening polymerization of &lt;i&gt;rac&lt;/i&gt;-lactide (ROP), giving a turnover frequency (TOF) value of 49.5 h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; compared to 15.7 h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 24.0 h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;. The higher reactivity of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; in comparison to &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; is due to the metal-metal cooperativity in cesium coordination polymeric networks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Very Readily Prepared Ligand for Rhodium Catalyzed Propene Hydroformylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent developments aimed at switching the selectivity of rhodium catalyzed hydroformylation from a linear&#8208;selective to a branched selective reaction feature ligands that are relatively complicated to prepare. A new ligand, EasyDiPhos, can be made in just one synthetic step and gives unusually low n:iso ratios, i.e., favoring the branched aldehyde, iso&#8208;butanal, in propene hydroformylation.








Abstract
In the search for an easy&#8208;to&#8208;make ligand that would enable Rh catalyzed hydroformylation of propene to favor the branched aldehydes, iso&#8208;butanal, bis&#8208;phosphonites and bis&#8208;phosphoramidites were designed. Catalysts derived from bis&#8208;phosphonites gave the desired low n:iso ratios, but were unstable to hydrolysis. A bis&#8208;phosphoramidite ligand (EasyDiPhos) that can be made in just one synthetic step has been discovered that enables Rh&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylations to proceed with unusually low n:iso ratios. They were also found to have significant stability to moisture, air, and to relatively high temperatures during hydroformylation conditions. The latter was studied using a combination of high pressure infra&#8208;red (HPIR) spectroscopy and NMR analysis of the catalyst resting state after 1 week under relevant conditions. Propene hydroformylation with n:iso ratios well below 1 was carried out and with turnover numbers around 1000&#160;mol/mol in 1 hour reaction time. One of the ligands, whilst not being the most iso&#8208;selective example, had a partially flexible n:iso ratio depending on temperature and pressure. Two Pt(II) complexes were prepared and their X&#8208;ray crystal structures determined. The most&#160;iso&#8208;selective catalyst was examined at low temperature (prioritizing iso&#8208;selectivity over rates) in hydroformylation of some other terminal alkenes with significant branched selectivity.

         <title>Carboxyltin&#8208;Functionalized Tungstobismuthate/TiO2 Photoanodes for Enhanced Energy Storage Effect in Metal Photoelectrochemical Cathodic Protection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, POMs are introduced into the PECCP system. The carboxyltin functionalized Bi&#8208;POMs can tightly composite with TiO2, and the Bi&#8208;POM/TiO2 photoanodes can provide PECCP for 304 stainless steel in seawater, which is expected to be a promising photoanode for in real seawater.








Abstract
Photoelectrochemical cathodic protection (PECCP) is a novel and environment&#8208;friendly metal anti&#8208;corrosion technology, and constructing photoelectronic materials that can provide sustained protection under both illumination and dark is a key challenge. Herein, four cases of transition metal (TM) and carboxyltin&#8208;modified polyoxometalates (POMs) based on trivacant Keggin&#8208;type tungstobismuthate subunits, denoted as Bi&#8208;POMs, were designed and synthesized in aqueous solutions. The introduced carboxyl groups can anchor TiO2, and the export of electrons from POM clusters occurred, making these POM&#8208;based materials useable in the PECCP field for the first time. Under illumination, the Bi&#8208;POM/TiO2 photoanodes were capable of cathodically polarizing 304 stainless steel (304SS) by 440&#8211;465&#160;mV. In darkness, their coupled potentials of &#8722;197 to &#8722;175&#160;mV were significantly lower than that of TiO2 (&#8722;97&#160;mV), indicating the obviously enhanced dark cathodic protection effect. Precisely, the interdependence between Bi, POM, and TiO2 ensures Bi&#8208;POMs to protect 304SS in seawater and provide stable and sustainable cathodic protection under intermittent light. The underlying mechanisms of PECCP were explored by a variety of experimental techniques including the femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The integration of POMs into the PECCP system represents a new insight in the development of green metal protection technologies.

         <dc:description>The bottom&#8208;up construction of leaf&#8208;like materials capable of using visible light and water to produce oxygen and chemical energy&#160;is a major goal of artificial photosynthesis. In this work, we show that robust artificial cells (protocells) prepared by&#160;the membranization of polymer/nucleotide coacervate droplets with a&#160;bio&#8208;inspired Ru&#8208;based polyoxometalate catalytic oxygen evolving center&#160;are capable of continuous&#160;light&#8208;assisted water&#160;oxidation at room temperature. We then&#160;present&#160;a method to electrostatically assemble millions of the&#160;photocatalytic protocells into tissue&#8208;like protocellular sheets and spheroids, and demonstrate that the protocellular assemblies exhibit enhanced rates of photocatalytic water oxidation compared with individual protocells. Our results highlight opportunities for synergistically integrating key aspects of photocatalysis, cytomimetics and bottom&#8208;up engineering towards the development of modular photosynthetic active matter and applications in artificial photosynthesis and energy capture.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantum Chemistry based Simulation of Enantioseparation on Cyclodextrin&#8208; and Polysaccharide&#8208;based Chiral Stationary Phases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We assess the capability of modern quantum chemical methods to simulate enantioseparation on chiral stationary phases (CSPs) in high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) by comparing calculated and experimental elution orders (EEOs). Compared to previous studies, this work utilizes more accurate state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art density functional theory (DFT) methods combined with automated computational workflows. The proposed approach employs molecular docking, conformer sampling, and DFT refinement for final ensemble&#8208;based association free energy calculations of two diastereomeric complexes. Ten drug&#8208;type molecules were considered on two common CSPs for which various molecular models were investigated. While the association free energies of the strongest binding motifs were rather system&#8208;depended ranging from about &#8722;9 kcal/mol to 29 kcal/mol, the differences between the two enantiomers were always only a few kcal/mol, sometimes even below 1 kcal/mol. Despite these small differences, correct determination of EEOs for all tested cyclodextrin&#8208;based CSP systems was achieved. Even for more flexible polysaccharide&#8208;based CSPs, the workflow yielded correct EEO results in 90% of the tested cases provided that a sufficiently large cut&#8208;out of the CSP material consisting of about 150 atoms was considered as model. Due to the latter constraint, the method remains computationally expensive, requiring further research for improving practical application in, e.g., screening studies.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We assess the capability of modern quantum chemical methods to simulate enantioseparation on chiral stationary phases (CSPs) in high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) by comparing calculated and experimental elution orders (EEOs). Compared to previous studies, this work utilizes more accurate state-of-the-art density functional theory (DFT) methods combined with automated computational workflows. The proposed approach employs molecular docking, conformer sampling, and DFT refinement for final ensemble-based association free energy calculations of two diastereomeric complexes. Ten drug-type molecules were considered on two common CSPs for which various molecular models were investigated. While the association free energies of the strongest binding motifs were rather system-depended ranging from about &#8722;9 kcal/mol to 29 kcal/mol, the differences between the two enantiomers were always only a few kcal/mol, sometimes even below 1 kcal/mol. Despite these small differences, correct determination of EEOs for all tested cyclodextrin-based CSP systems was achieved. Even for more flexible polysaccharide-based CSPs, the workflow yielded correct EEO results in 90% of the tested cases provided that a sufficiently large cut-out of the CSP material consisting of about 150 atoms was considered as model. Due to the latter constraint, the method remains computationally expensive, requiring further research for improving practical application in, e.g., screening studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual Photoredox/Palladium Catalysis Enabled Enantioselective Heck/Reductive Allylic Homocoupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochemical palladium&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective reductive coupling reaction of conjugated dienes was developed. This transformation provides a platform for synthesizing optically pure chiral 1,5&#8208;dienes bearing 1,8&#8208;stereocenters.








Abstract
The merger of palladium&#8208;catalyzed Tsuji&#8211;Trost reactions with photochemical radical chemistry represents a cutting&#8208;edge field in transition metal catalysis. We report a photochemical palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Heck/reductive allylic homocoupling reaction of 1,3&#8208;dienes. The transformation has a wide substrate scope and good functional group tolerance, providing a platform to synthesize optically pure chiral 1,5&#8208;dienes bearing 1,8&#8208;stereocenters. The reaction initiates with a Heck&#8208;type addition to generate a &#960;&#8208;allyl&#8208;PdII species, followed by a photoredox process or ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) to generate an allylic radical, which undergoes homocoupling to give the final product.

         <title>Photocatalytic Oxidation of Alcohols with Organic Dyes: From Homogeneous Systems to Sensitized Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We discuss the developments in the light&#8208;driven oxidation of alcohols with PC. We report cases where the homogeneous systems can be interfaced with electrochemical tools or adapted in flow and where the PC are integrated in sensitized materials.








Abstract
The oxidation of alcohols retains an enormous importance in industry and in synthetic organic chemistry. The renaissance in photocatalysis is offering new routes to conduct this class of transformations under benign and sustainable conditions. In this concept article, we highlight the efforts that have been conducted in light&#8208;driven oxidation of alcohols using organic photocatalysts (PC). After an overview of relevant industrial processes, we will discuss relevant examples of PC employed in solution or when integrated in photosynthetic schemes within semiconductor slides or nanoparticles. The combination of the photochemical systems with electrochemical routes or their engineering in flow will be considered. Where possible, we highlight also mechanistic aspects that reveal the key steps involved and contribute to improve the performance of the process. We finally present an outlook on the future perspectives and developments in the field.

         <title>DNA Tetrahedron&#8208;Enhanced Catalytic Hairpin Assembly for in Situ Monitoring of Viral RNA in Host Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional system based on tetrahedral DNA nanostructures (TDN) for detecting and monitoring the release and replication of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) genomic RNA in host cells. The system responds to the presence of viral RNA, utilizing a highly efficient TDN&#8208;based hyperbranched catalytic hairpin assembly to produce specific fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) signals corresponding to the level of the target viral RNA.








Abstract
Viruses pose significant threats to global public health and have substantial socio&#8208;economic impacts. Developing rapid, sensitive, and specific in situ virus&#8208;detection technologies is crucial for tracking viral genome release, replication in host cells, and intercellular transmission, thus holding great promise in understanding viral infection mechanisms, enabling early diagnosis, screening antiviral drugs, and formulating prevention and treatment strategies. In this study, we present a multifunctional tetrahedral DNA nanostructure (TDN)&#8208;based system designed to monitor viral RNA levels in host cells in situ. The system employs a TDN&#8208;based hyperbranched catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) reaction to achieve rapid and powerful signal amplification, generating specific fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) signals in response to target viral RNA. Using Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) as a model, we developed the THA@JEV system responding to JEV&#8208;RNA. This system demonstrated rapid and sensitive detection of JEV&#8208;RNA within 12 minutes in a cell&#8208;free environment, enabling real&#8208;time imaging of JEV&#8208;RNA in situ within host cells. The integrated TDN structure enhanced the biological stability of the probes and ensured their reliability under various stress conditions and microenvironments. This TDN&#8208;based sensor system shows significant potential for elucidating viral infection pathways and advancing related virology research, as well as for screening antiviral drugs.

         <title>Pd[B(S2O7)2]2 and Pd[B(SO4)(S2O7)]2: Two Borosulfates with Pd2+ in Cctahedral and one with Pd2+ in Square Planar Oxygen Coordination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of elemental palladium with B2O3 and SO3 at elevated temperature results in the formation of blue crystals of Pd[B(S2O7)2]2. Dependent on the reaction conditions, the compound crystallizes in two different polymorphs obtained as bulk samples. In both structures the Pd2+ cations are coordinated by six oxygen atoms in form of an almost perfect octahedron. All oxygen atoms belong to the borosulfate anions [B(S2O7)2]&#8211; and link via Pd2+ cations to an extended network structure. Within the uncommon octahedral oxygen coordination, the Pd2+ cations reveal a d8 high&#8208;spin configuration, which leads to paramagnetism. Occasionally, red crystals are formed during the reaction next to the major fraction of blue crystals of Pd[B(S2O7)2]2. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis on the red crystals reveals the sum formula Pd[B(SO4)(S2O7)]2 with Pd2+ in square&#8208;planar coordination.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Benzene Fluorophore with Enhanced Emission: Insights Into Photophysical Properties Through Proton Transfer Mapping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;benzene fluorophore, presenting an ESIPT, exhibits also a crystallization&#8208;induced emission enhancement and pH&#8208;dependent luminescence intensity. The modelization of the energy landscapes, combining proton transfer or deprotonation with rotations of substituents, demonstrates the existence of nonemissive conformations and rationalizes the experimental emission properties.








Abstract
A comprehensive study of a single&#8208;benzene fluorophore, characterized by a low molecular weight and a significant Stokes&#8217; shift, is reported. The fluorophore exhibits crystallization&#8208;induced emission enhancement and pH&#8208;dependent luminescence, attributable to a conformational lock in the crystalline state and suppression of nonemissive forms upon deprotonation. Extensive photophysical analysis reveals a quantum yield increase from 1% in solution to 22% in the solid state, along with a consistent emission wavelength irrespective of the state. Theoretical calculations show that the Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer (ESIPT) mechanism is facilitated by the unique orientation of acetyl substituents and a strong intramolecular hydrogen bond in the solid state and rationalized the large Stokes&#8217; shift observed. We explore the role of crystallization and intramolecular interactions in modifying the photophysical behavior of the fluorophore, emphasizing the absence of solvatochromism and the distinctive absence of strong intermolecular interactions in the solid state. Further theoretical modeling underscores the interplay between geometric conformation and proton transfer in determining emission properties, which is dramatically altered upon deprotonation. Therefore, detailed theoretical approaches to comprehensively map the complete photophysical landscape offer critical insights for the design and synthesis of small molecules that outperform larger fluorophores while retaining stimuli&#8208;responsive properties.

         <title>Conformational Switch in the Alpha&#8208;Synuclein C&#8208;Terminal Domain Directs Its Fibril Polymorphs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conformational state of the C&#8208;terminal domain determines the fibril morphology of full&#8208;length wild&#8208;type alpha&#8208;synuclein: high C&#8208;terminus flexibility promotes twisted fibrils, while partial C&#8208;terminal folding drives the assembly of rod&#8208;like fibrils.








Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Synuclein (&#945;Syn) inclusions are a pathological hallmark of several neurodegenerative disorders. While cryo&#8208;electron microscopy studies have revealed distinct fibril polymorphs across different synucleinopathies, the molecular switches controlling polymorphism remain unveiled. In this study, we found that fibril morphology is associated with the conformational state of monomeric &#945;Syn. Through systematic evaluation of the ionic strength and temperature, we generated two distinct polymorphs: a twisted morphology at low ionic strength and temperature, and a rod&#8208;like morphology at higher ionic strength and temperature. Using solid&#8208;state NMR, we revealed that both polymorphs share a highly conserved core structure, with morphological differences arising probably from distinct structural arrangements at the protofilament interfaces. Furthermore, we found that a specific conformational change in the C&#8208;terminal domain of the monomeric &#945;Syn serves as a molecular switch for the formation of polymorphs. Interestingly, this conformational change can also be triggered by calcium binding to the C&#8208;terminus, connecting environmental factors to specific fibril architectures. Our results reveal a conformational role for the C&#8208;terminal domain that influences &#945;Syn fibril morphology, providing significant insights into the fibrogenesis of &#945;Syn.

         <title>Structural Insights and Advanced Spectroscopic Characterization of Thiazolothiazoles: Unveiling Potential for Optoelectronic and Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TzTz derivatives are promising materials for flexible optoelectronic and sensing applications due to their easy synthesis, tunable properties, and stability. This study analyzes 10 TzTz derivatives, detailing their synthesis, spectroscopic characterization (FTIR, NMR, UV&#8208;Vis), fluorescence behavior, and synchrotron XANES findings, showcasing their potential for advanced electronic and optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Thiazolothiazoles (TzTzs) are planar, &#960;&#8208;conjugated heterocyclic compounds exhibiting unique structural and optoelectronic properties. In this study, a series of symmetrically substituted thiazolothiazole (TzTz) derivatives including imidazolyl, o&#8208;vanillyl, p&#8208;vanillyl, phenyl, thiazolyl, cinnamoyl, and trifluoromethylphenyl were synthesized and extensively characterized using X&#8208;ray crystallography (XRD), Fourier&#8208;transformed infrared (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV&#8208;Vis) spectroscopies, photoluminescence, X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure (XANES, S K&#8208;edge), and density functional calculations. The compounds demonstrated diverse intermolecular interactions, including &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking and chalcogen bonding, which directly influenced their optical properties and electronic band structures. Several derivatives displayed promising features such as large Stokes shifts over 0.4&#160;eV in solution and up to 1&#160;eV in solid state and reversible resistive switching behavior, positioning them as attractive candidates for use in optoelectronic devices and emerging memristive technologies.

The photophysical properties as well as the multielectron storage capacity of a several ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complexes with flavin&#8208;inspired &#960;&#8208;extended ligands are investigated in a joint synthetic&#8208;spectroscopic&#8208;theoretical approach.








Abstract
Light&#8208;driven electron transfer and subsequent multielectron storage is among the key aspects of photochemical reactions in artificial photosynthesis and molecular electronics. Following our previously introduced design and characterization of Ru(II)&#8208;based photosensitizers, four new Ru complexes with &#960;&#8208;extended ligands featuring a flavin&#8208;inspired subunit were investigated via density functional theory in order to evaluate their electrochemical properties ahead of a time and resource&#8208;demanding synthesis. Two complexes, Ru&#8208;Me2alloxB and Ru&#8208;Me2deazaalloxB, with a bent ligand architecture, were identified as promising candidates for application in light&#8208;driven charge accumulation and subsequently synthesized. The electrochemical characterization of Ru&#8208;Me2alloxB confirmed the theoretical predictions and its photophysical properties were investigated using UV/Vis absorption, resonance Raman, time&#8208;resolved emission, and time&#8208;resolved absorption spectroscopy in combination with quantum chemical simulations. Furthermore, first insights into the electronic distribution in the singly reduced complex were modelled computationally and obtained by EPR and UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy and spectroelectrochemistry. These results underline the promising multielectron storage capacity of the newly designed &#960;&#8208;extended alloxazine ligand.

         <title>Ultrasmall Gold Nanoparticles (2&#160;nm) Decorated with a High Density of Photochemically Switchable Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoswitchable azo ligands can be conjugated to the surface of ultrasmall gold nanoparticles with a high density (about 50 ligands on each nanoparticle). Their photoswitching is not constrained by the binding to the gold surface and can be used to induce a nematic&#8208;to&#8208;isotropic phase transition in a liquid crystal.








Abstract
Ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (2&#160;nm) were surface&#8208;coated with photoswitchable 3&#8208;azopyridine ligands by ligand exchange with n&#8208;dodecanethiol&#8208;stabilized gold nanoparticles. Each gold nanoparticle carried about 66 dodecanethiol (DDT) ligands and 49 azo ligands. The azo ligands were reversibly switchable between the stable E&#8208; and the metastable Z&#8208;isomer by UV and green light irradiation as shown by UV&#8208;Vis and NMR spectroscopy. The photoswitching was not significantly affected by the conjugation of the azo ligand to the nanoparticle surface, despite the high density of ligands on the particle surface. This offers a pathway for photoswitchable systems on the nanoscale, for example, to manipulate supramolecular systems. The introduction of 0.5 wt% of the nanoparticles into a liquid crystalline host yielded a photoresponsive material which showed a reversible nematic&#8208;to&#8208;isotropic phase transition upon irradiation

Their photoswitching is not constrained by the binding to the gold surface and can be used to induce a nematic-to-isotropic phase transition in a liquid crystal.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (2&#160;nm) were surface-coated with photoswitchable 3-azopyridine ligands by ligand exchange with n-dodecanethiol-stabilized gold nanoparticles. Each gold nanoparticle carried about 66 dodecanethiol (DDT) ligands and 49 azo ligands. The azo ligands were reversibly switchable between the stable &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;- and the metastable &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-isomer by UV and green light irradiation as shown by UV-Vis and NMR spectroscopy. The photoswitching was not significantly affected by the conjugation of the azo ligand to the nanoparticle surface, despite the high density of ligands on the particle surface. This offers a pathway for photoswitchable systems on the nanoscale, for example, to manipulate supramolecular systems. The introduction of 0.5 wt% of the nanoparticles into a liquid crystalline host yielded a photoresponsive material which showed a reversible nematic-to-isotropic phase transition upon irradiation&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemical Properties of an Aryloxenium Cation with a Triplet Electronic Ground State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryloxenium cations contain a formally positively&#8208;charged, monovalent oxygen atom with an incomplete electron shell. In spite of this unusual structural element, they are key intermediates in many important processes, such as biological oxidation reactions and the industrial generation of thermoplastics. However, the development of new applications is hindered by the lack of knowledge on their fundamental chemical properties. While most past studies have focused on aryloxenium cations with singlet electronic ground states, minor structural modifications can produce aryloxenium cations that have a triplet ground state. Unfortunately, examination of the reactivity of triplet aryloxenium cations is limited to just two studies that reported the detection of H atom abstraction from solvents. A detailed kinetic reactivity study involving cyclohexane, allyl iodide and dimethyl disulfide reagents is reported here for an aryloxenium cation with a triplet electronic ground state, the 2&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;pyridyloxenium cation.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitroreductase&#8208;Responsive Bioorthogonal Tetrazine Conjugations in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prodrugs in response to tumor overexpressed enzymes offer a targeted approach for cancer therapy. However, this strategy faces several challenges, including poor water solubility, off&#8208;target effects, and tumor heterogeneity. To address these limitations, this study developed a novel class of nitroreductase&#8208;responsive tetrazine precursors by employing nitrobenzyl as a masking group for dihydrotetrazines (NBdTz), which can be further functionalized with targeting peptides. Furthermore, we have demonstrated a dual tumor&#8208;selective on demand bioorthogonal prodrug activation enabled by RGD&#8208;NBdTz. RGD promotes tumor cellular uptake by interacting with tumor&#8208;associated integrin &#945;v&#946;3, and subsequent enzymatic reduction of aromatic nitro group of NBdTz by overexpressed NTR among hypoxic tumor microenvironment leads to the liberation of the bioorthogonal handle tetrazine, resulting in the anticipated bioorthogonal activation of trans&#8208;cyclooctene caged payloads through "click&#8208;to&#8208;release" reactions. We envision the presented NBdTz enabled tumor&#8208;selective on demand tetrazine ligation offers new opportunities for cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Competition between Photoswitching and Fluorescence in Hemiindigos and Hemithioindigos</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intrinsically fluorescent photoswitches (IFPSs) are crucial for super&#8208;resolution microscopy techniques. This study explores the impact of substituents on fluorescence and photoswitching efficiency in hemiindigos and hemithioindigos. A series of functionalized derivatives were synthesized by one&#8208;step Knoevenagel condensations using a sustainable mechanochemical approach and characterized across various environments. Ortho&#8208;OH&#8208;substituted hemiindigo derivatives exhibited high fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;FL = 0.65) while retaining significant photoswitching capabilities (&#934;Z&#8594;E = 0.29 in THF) and fast recovery. These enhanced properties are attributed to the p&#8208;electron&#8208;donating characteristics of the OH substituents and the presence of intramolecular hydrogen bonds. The results of CC2 ab initio calculations revealed a detailed photoswitching mechanism: (1) initial population of the fluorescent pp* singlet excited state minimum, (2) subsequent elongation of the C=O bond leading to depopulation of the pp* state to the np* excited state minimum, (3) twisting of the double bond within the np* state, and (4) relaxation to the ground electronic state via a conical intersection. The analysis of the potential&#8208;energy surfaces modulated by EDG substittents, both in the in the pp* and np* excited states, provides insights into the structure&#8208;property relationships of IFPSs, guiding future rational design.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic and Magnetic Properties of Ferrous Iron in a True Square&#8208;Planar Molecular Environment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electronic and magnetic properties of ferrous iron in the substituted iron phthalocyanine, FePcOAr, exhibiting a true square&#8208;planar molecular environment, are investigated. Inhibition of intermolecular interactions by steric substituents, allows detailed investigation of the electronic structure arising from the planar geometry of the d6 electron configuration. Complementary magnetometry, M&#246;ssbauer, FD&#8208;FT THz&#8208;EPR and paramagnetic NMR spectroscopies show that FePcOAr has an S = 1 ground state with large positive, axial zero&#8208;field splitting and a strongly anisotropic g&#8208;tensor, with two g&#8208;values much larger than the free electron g&#8208;value and one smaller. Correlation between the magnetic properties and the electronic structure is provided by high&#8208;level quantum chemical calculations. The calculations indicate a nearly triply degenerate ground level, in which spin&#8208;orbit coupling mixes the isolated 3A2g ground state with two excited 3Eg states, whose energy gaps to the ground state are almost identical. These findings provide valuable insights in the electronic structure of phthalocyanines and the long standing discussion on their true electronic ground level, which has important implications for the application of this important class of complexes in catalysis and magnetic materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a thermo&#8208;mechanochemical synthesis of metal phthalocyanines with varying metal centers and building blocks. The reactions were performed using a Retsch Mixer Mill 400 equipped with heating jackets, achieving quantitative yields at 120 &#176;C within 2 hours. A systematic screening of reaction parameters, including temperature, reaction time, frequency, and liquid&#8208;assisted grinding (LAG), revealed that temperature and time significantly influence the reaction outcome, as well as the use of LAG compared to neat grinding, which further enhances the yield. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of the obtained metal phthalocyanines confirmed the presence of different polymorphs, suggesting a correlation between reaction conditions and crystallinity. Furthermore, the crystalline cobalt polyphthalocyanine (CoPPc) was successfully synthesized with a yield of &gt;99%.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A variety of bifluorenylidene&#8208;based bistricyclic aromatic enes (BAEs) and their derivatives have been prepared via the palladium&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki coupling/Heck cyclization tandem reaction in one pot. In the new scheme 2&#8208;bromophenyl trifluoromethanesulfonate and similar derivatives were chosen as one of reaction substrates, which could undergo tandem Suzuki coupling/Heck cyclization reaction with suitable arylboronic acid ester substrates to afford the expected BAEs and their derivatives. In the newly designed scheme, the raw materials are easier to obtain and can be applied to the synthesis of more BAEs and their derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Ligand Cooperativity via &#928;&#8208;&#928; Interactions Supporting Outer&#8208;Sphere Hydride Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A set of phosphine&#8208;free Ru(II)&#8208;CNC pincer complexes with benzimidazolylidene&#8208;based CNC&#8208;ligands have been synthesized and characterized which show excellent catalytic activity towards &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones using primary alcohols. DFT investigations revealed that these seemingly non&#8208;bifunctional complexes can operate via inner&#8208;sphere and outer&#8208;sphere mechanisms for the alcohol dehydrogenation step; however, the outer&#8208;sphere path is favored for the subsequent steps. The outer&#8208;sphere path is found to be supported by &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction between the extended aromatic ring system of the benzimidazolylidene&#8208;based CNC&#8208;ligand and aromatic rings of the substrates in a new, unprecedented case of metal&#8208;ligand cooperativity.</dc:description>

         <title>Titanium cis&#8208;DACH Salan Catalyst for the Efficient Epoxidation of Non&#8208;Activated Olefins with Hydrogen Peroxide &#8208; Terminal&#8208;Selective Epoxidation of Multiply &#160;Unsaturated Terpenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a new generation of highly active and readily available homogeneous titanium catalysts for the epoxidation of non&#8208;activated olefins with aqueous hydrogen peroxide. Key feature is the introduction of pentafluorophenyl substituents into a salan ligand derived from cis&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane (cis&#8208;DACH). Our novel salan ligand is accessible in one single step by reductive alkylation of cis&#8208;DACH with 3&#8208;(pentafluorophenyl)salicylic aldehyde. In situ com&#173;plexation with Ti(OiPr)4 of the cis&#8208;DACH salan provides the titanium catalyst which, in the presence of aqueous hydrogen peroxide, smoothly epoxidizes a broad spectrum of olefins with up to 95% yield, at a catalyst loading of 0.5 mol&#8208;% only. The achiral cis&#8208;DACH salan catalyst showed syn&#8208;selectivity (4.7:1) in the epoxidation of a chiral, racemic terminal allylic alcohol. This catalyst furthermore allows the regioselective (up to 49:1) epoxidation of the terminal double bond in multiply unsaturated terpenes such as myrcene, (S)&#8208;citronellene, and (R)&#8208;linalool. For the latter two substrates, syn/anti&#8208;selectivity of up to 9:1 was observed. Augmented syn/anti&#8208;selectivity (up to 50:1 syn, or 25:1 anti) can be induced in the epoxidation of the chiral substrates (S)&#8208;citronellene and (R)&#8208;linalool when the "matched" enantiomer of the chiral "Berkessel salalen ligand" is employed.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvatochromism and Redox Multi&#8208;Switch in a Trinuclear Cobalt(II) Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A trinuclear cobalt(II) complex incorporating the redox&#8208;active hexahydroxytriphenylene (H6HHTP) ligand was prepared and isolated in two different redox states: [CoII3(sq&#8208;sq&#8208;sq)]3+ (1) and [CoII3(cat&#8208;sq&#8208;sq)]2+ (2) (sq = semiquinone; cat = catecholate), enabled by its remarkable solvatochromic behavior. The ligand field tuning of the Co(II) centers through the ancillary ligand Me3TPA (tris(6&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine) allowed accessing six reversible one&#8208;electron processes instead of only three with the parent TPA ligand, therefore increasing the range of redox&#8208;coupled magnetic and optical switching in this system. Upon reduction, the three redox processes are ligand&#8208;centered and involve the three sq&#8226;&#8208;/cat2&#8208; couples of HHTP, while we hypothesize that some of the oxidation processes may involve the Co(II) metallic species.</dc:description>

         <title>1,3&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;Zwitterionic Complexes of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes in Reactions with Arylallenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of 2&#8208;arylcyclopropane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylates (ACDC) with GaCl3 and other Lewis acids in the presence of 3&#8208;arylbuta&#8208;1,2&#8208;dienes, which acts as a trapping agent for the 1,2&#8208; or 1,3&#8208;zwitterionic intermediates being generated, has been studied. The reaction of 1,2&#8208;zwitterionic gallium complexes at low temperature has been found to give products of annulation at the phenyl substituent in the allene, 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;(inden&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethylmalonates, as the main products. Only in the case of naphthylcyclopropanedicarboxylate, the formation of a polycyclic frame by annulation at both aromatic moieties occurred upon an increase in temperature to 0&#176;C. Trapping of 1,3&#8208;zwitterions, the primary intermediates of cyclopropane ring opening, by the indicated allene was most successful if catalytic amounts of GaCl3 were added directly to the reaction mixture. In this case, the reaction followed the pathway of the usual formal (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition of 1,3&#8208;zwitterions at each of the double bonds of the allene to give the corresponding exo&#8208;methylenecyclopentane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylates in up to 93% yields. This process occurred with the highest efficiency at the unsubstituted double bond of 3&#8208;arylbuta&#8208;1,2&#8208;diene.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetically arrested SERS&#8208;Active aggregates for biosensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is a demand for biosensors capable of long&#8208;term, non&#8208;invasive monitoring of low analyte concentrations in various biofluids for diagnostics, personalized healthcare, and disease monitoring. Biofluids present challenges to biosensor sensing and stability on account of their complex composition and dynamic nature. Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) offers ultra&#8208;high sensitivity, non&#8208;destructive, real&#8208;time monitoring and non&#8208;invasive detection, ideal for sensing in complex media. Plasmonic gold nanoparticle (AuNP) SERS&#8208;active assemblies have been widely explored owning to their biocompatibility and tuneable sensitivity based on AuNP morphology. Controlled aggregation of AuNPs has been achieved by incorporating a &#8216;molecular&#8208;glue&#8217;, cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]), to produce AuNP:CB[7] aggregates containing robust nanogaps (ca. 1 nm) and displaying strong, reproducible SERS signals at low concentrations, but eventually leads to irreversible precipitation. Here we employ thiolated poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG&#8208;SH) to produce kinetically trapped metastable AuNP:CB[7]:PEG aggregates. The aggregates maintain SERS&#8208;activity, are highly tuneable through facile modification of the PEG chain length and grafting density, and possess improved stability. Moreover, the AuNP:CB[7]:PEG aggregates demonstrate low concentration detection of a common Raman reporter alongside a bioanalyte in a range of biofluids highlighting the potential application of these aggregates for non&#8208;invasive in vivo long&#8208;term monitoring alongside future customized SERS biosensing applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We herein developed a novel method for generating nitro radicals using sodium nitrite under electrocatalytic conditions for the first time. A series of vicinal hydroxynitro or chloronitro compounds was generated in good yields. This methodology features simple reaction setup, mild reaction conditions, and cheap electrodes, and simultaneously shows excellent functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope, enabling efficient gram&#8208;scale reactions with good to excellent yields. Besides, the EIS and CV results provided deeper insights into the reaction mechanism. Further extensions of the method have also confirmed the practicality of the strategy developed.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The direct radical arylation of tyrosine residues in peptides has been achieved under highly attractive conditions, requiring only the peptide substrate, a 3,4,5&#8208;trifluorophenyldiazonium salt and irradiation with visible light. Being well&#8208;balanced in its reactivity to form strong charge transfer complexes with the phenolic side chain, which are required for initiation and aryl radical formation, the trifluoro substitution still shows sufficient stability towards nucleophilic aromatic substitution in aqueous solution. Besides allowing selective arylation, the introduction of the 3,4,5&#8208;trifluorophenyl unit enables further functionalization as well as potential applications in NMR and MRT studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Seawater Oxygen Evolution with Improved Electronic Environment of NiCoPS through Fluorine Doping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing economical and robust electrocatalysts to prevent chlorine ions corrosion and improve seawater splitting efficiency is essential for seawater electrolysis. Herein, fluorine&#8208;doped nickel cobalt phospho&#8208;sulfide nanowires (F&#8208;NiCoPS NWs) were synthesized as high&#8208;performance catalysts for overall seawater splitting. The strongly electronegative F anion is favorable to build weak metal fluorine bonds, which easily break to generate highly active species of Ni/Co&#8208;hydroxides/oxyhydroxides protective layer on the electrode surface. This process effectively avoids chlorine evolution reaction (ClER)&#8208;induced dissolution, and enhances the stability of catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the electronegative fluorine affects the electronic structure of the catalyst&#8217; surface, further enhancing the adsorption energy and electronic conductivity of the reaction intermediates. F&#8208;NiCoPS with appropriate F doping significantly decreased the overpotential (228 (303) mV at 10 (100) mA cm&#8208;2) and the Tafel slope (44 mV dec&#8208;1) in alkaline seawater, and exhibited a long stability of 100 h. This work provides new insights for constructing effective, cost&#8208;efficient and non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalyst for alkaline seawater splitting.</dc:description>
