         <title>Formation of TEMPO Adducts with Hydrogen Atom Transfer: An Alternative Pathway to Versatile Hydrofunctionalizations of Olefins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A two&#8208;step process is developed to access a broad range of hydrofunctionalization of olefins, by combining a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed formation of TEMPO adduct from olefins and a photocatalytic nucleophilic addition to generate a new C&#8208;C, C&#8208;N, C&#8208;O, C&#8208;F, and C&#8208;Cl bond. Nucleophilic fluorination can be achieved with a short reaction time, showing its potential in PET applications. Combining the two steps, net hydrofunctionalization of olefins with a broad range has been achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Selectively 13C/2H/15N&#8208;Labelled Arginine to Probe Protein Conformation and Interaction by NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The charged arginine side chain is unique in determining many innate properties of proteins, contributing to stability and interaction surfaces, and directing allosteric regulation and enzymatic catalysis. NMR experiments can be used to reveal these processes at the molecular level, but it often requires selective insertion of carbon&#8208;13, nitrogen&#8208;15 and deuterium at defined atomic positions. We introduce a method to endow arginine residues with defined isotope patterns, combining synthetic organic chemistry and cell&#8208;based protein overexpression. The resulting proteins feature NMR active spin systems with optimized relaxation pathways leading to simplified NMR spectra with a sensitive response to changes in the chemical environment of the nuclei observed.</dc:description>

         <title>A Binaphthyl Macrocycle Exhibiting Circularly Polarized Luminescence: On&#8208;off Switch Triggered by Molecular Recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of D4&#8208;symmetric (S)&#8208;1,1'&#8208;binaphthyl cyclic tetramers were synthesized. The signs and intensities of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) of the tetramers depended on the substituents, which was caused by differences of the binaphthyl dihedral angles in the excited state. The chiral dye with hydroxy groups did not exhibit CPL. However, this dye exhibited turn&#8208;on CPL upon addition of amino acids such as l&#8208;phenylalanine in an enantioselective and positive allosteric manner, and the glum value reached +7.3 &#215; 10&#8211;3. The CPL was repeatedly switched on and off by changing temperature. The turn&#8208;on CPL was caused by the guest molecules expanding the binaphthyl dihedral angles with multiple hydrogen bonds. (+)&#8208;Andersen sulfinate also induced enantioselective turn&#8208;on CPL.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Core&#8208;Fucosylated Asymmetrical N&#8208;Glycans with Different&#8208;Length Oligo&#8208;N&#8208;Acetyllactosamine Motifs and Their Sialylated Extensions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient chemoenzymatic approach for the diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of core&#8208;fucosylated asymmetrical N&#8208;glycans bearing different lengths of oligo&#8208;N&#8208;acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) and their sialylated extensions was described. Two oligosaccharide precursors were chemically synthesized by length&#8208;controlled introduction of oligo&#8208;LacNAc motifs through stereoselectively iterative glycosylation of a common hexasaccharide intermediate. Both oligosaccharide precursors can be well recognized by &#945;1,6&#8208;fucosyltransferase FUT8 to generate core&#8208;fucosylated N&#8208;glycans, which was subjected to divergent enzymatic extension using a galactosyltransferase module and two sialyltransferase modules to provide a wide array of core&#8208;fucosylated asymmetrical biantennary N&#8208;glycans having different&#8208;length oligo&#8208;LacNAc motifs capped by various sialic acid&#8208;linkages.</dc:description>

         <title>Lipase&#8208;Palladium Co&#8208;catalyzed Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of Racemic Allylic Esters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) by combining lipase&#8208;catalyzed esterification of racemic sec&#8208;alcohols and in situ racemization has been widely studied; however, reports on DKR involving lipase&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis of racemic esters are scarce. This problem is probably due to the lack of more effective and general racemization methods. Herein, we report the enhanced hydrolytic DKR of racemic allylic esters. The discovery of the monodentate ligand P[C6H3&#8208;2,6&#8208;(OMe)2]3, which in situ generates Pd complex(es) highly reactive to racemization and the NaOAc&#8208;mediated acceleration of racemization, are notable breakthroughs. Consequently, the DKR of racemic allylic esters can be completed in a few hours at 40 &#176;C in most cases, yielding optically active allylic alcohols (93% to &gt;99% ee) in 58%&#8211;91% isolated yields with minimal side reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Production of Aromatic Amines From Nitroaromatics &#8208; Adressing a Critical Challenge in Environmental Remediation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The present work reviews the continuous flow hydrogenation of nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) to aromatic amines, highlighting its significance in sustainable chemical manufacturing. These processes offer enhanced efficiency, scalability, and safety compared to traditional batch methods, addressing the environmental concerns associated with NAC contamination. In this context, the flow mode processes of NACs hydrogenation may be considered as tools for catalytically&#8208;driven extraction of fine chemical products. Within this review, key aspects, including an overview of flow reactor designs&#8212;such as packed&#8208;bed and microreactors&#8212;optimizing heat and mass transfer are discussed. Additionally, various catalytic materials, including bimetallic nanoparticles and metal&#8208;organic frameworks, are explored for their improved stability and selectivity in NAC reduction. The kinetics of these reactions aids in understanding the factors affecting reaction, and mass transfer rates. Despite the advantages, challenges remain, including catalyst deactivation and reactor design complexities, particularly during scale&#8208;up for industrial applications. Future trends indicate a shift towards hybrid systems integrating photocatalysis and biocatalysis, enhancing the versatility of continuous flow processes. Ultimately, the adoption of these technologies is anticipated to play a crucial role in the circular economy by converting hazardous waste into valuable products, thereby fostering innovation and environmental preservation in the chemical industry.</dc:description>

         <title>A photo&#8208;stimulated Copper&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework as photoelectric material</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photo&#8208;stimulated Polymers have garnered significant attention for their potential applications ranging from optical memory to sensing. Herein, by changing coordination metal and the position of nitrogen atom in pyridine&#8208;based photo&#8208;stimulated ligand, we successfully synthesised a novel photo&#8208;stimulated copper&#8208;based MOF (Cu&#8208;MOF) using 9,10&#8208;bis(di(pyridine&#8208;3&#8208;yl)methylene)&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroanthracene as the photo&#8208;stimulated ligand. Structural analysis revealed a 3D porous architecture, offering a distinct advantage over previously reported 1D coordination polymer using similar photo&#8208;stimulated ligand. The Cu&#8208;MOF exhibited exceptional photoelectric properties, demonstrating potential as an anode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries and a luminescent MnO&#8324;&#8315; sensor. Its electrochemical performance revealed high reversibility, with discharge capacities retaining stability under varying current densities. Additionally, the Cu&#8208;MOF displayed notable photo&#8208;stimulated behavior under UV light irradiation, enhancing its optical properties. Although the structure changes from 1D coordination polymer to 3D MOF&#65292; the photocyclized form (c&#8208;Cu MOF) still exhibited superior fluorescence quenching efficiency and sensitivity for MnO&#8324;&#8315; detection with Ksv (quenching constant) 5.24 x 105 M&#8208;1. This work highlights the utility of Cu&#8208;MOF as a multifunctional material for energy storage and environmental sensing applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Functioning Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Methotrexate&#8208;Loaded Gadolinium MOFs as Drug Carriers and Radiosensitizers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cancer remains a critical global health challenge, necessitating advanced drug delivery systems through innovations in materials science and nanotechnology. This study evaluates Gadolinium Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (Gd&#8208;MOFs) as potential drug delivery systems for anticancer therapy, particularly when combined with radiotherapy. Gd&#8208;MOFs were synthesized using terephthalic acid and gadolinium (III) chloride hexahydrate, then loaded with methotrexate (MTX). Characterization via FTIR, TGA, DSC, MRI, and XRD confirmed their correct structure and stability. Effective MTX loading and controlled release were demonstrated. Anticancer effects were assessed on human healthy bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS&#8208;2B) and human lung cancer cells (A549) using the MTT assay under in vitro radiation therapy. MTX/Gd&#8208;MOF combined with radiotherapy showed a greater reduction in cancer cell viability (41.89%&#8239;&#177;&#8239;2.75 for A549) compared to healthy cells (56.80%&#8239;&#177;&#8239;1.97 for BEAS&#8208;2B), indicating selective cytotoxicity. These findings highlight the potential of Gd&#8208;MOFs not only as drug delivery vehicles but also as radiosensitizers, enhancing radiotherapy efficacy and offering promising evidence for their use in combinatory cancer therapies to improve treatment outcomes.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;induced electron transfer in ruthenium&#8208;polypyridyl&#8208;modified laccases: probing pathways from the surface to the metal centers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study explores the grafting of a ruthenium&#8208;polypyridyl photosensitizer onto the surface of a multi&#8208;copper oxidase to investigate photoinduced electron transfer (PIET) processes within the enzyme. Four Ru&#8208;laccase covalent hybrids unique in the position of the ruthenium complex relative to the type 1 copper (T1) and trinuclear copper cluster (TNC) centers of the enzyme are compared. The strategic positioning of the photosensitizer highlights the roles of distance and intervening medium on PIET pathways. Our results reveal photoreduction scenarios where the TNC center is reduced directly without first passing through the T1 center. We further illustrate the efficiency and robustness of these hybrid systems through continuous irradiation experiments and laser flash photolysis, shedding light on mechanistic pathways and potential applications in sustainable photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>A Parameter&#8208;Driven Approach to Modulating Chemical Composition in Prussian Blue Analogues Cathodes for Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study explores how various experimental factors, such as temperature, viscosity, and stirring speed, affect Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) material's structural properties and electroneutrality. These factors influence key attributes like sodium ions, vacancies, and water content, which is governed by electroneutrality. Higher temperatures, faster stirring, low viscosity, and high Na+ concentration enhance Na+ incorporation because of the sufficient Na+ supplement, leading to a dense monoclinic structure with fewer vacancies and lower water content. In contrast, lower temperatures, slow stirring, high viscosity, and low Na+ concentration lead to less monoclinic or cubic structures with more vacancies and higher water content. Adding carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) increases viscosity, enables lower Na+ diffusion, and renders less Na+ incorporation. As a result, an intermediate structure forms with balanced Na+ and water content, bridging the cubic and monoclinic forms. The electrochemical performance of cubic structures (PW&#8208;Cub) is superior, demonstrating better C&#8208;rate performance with distinct charge&#8208;discharge plateaus than monoclinic structures acquired at high temperatures (PW&#8208;Mc&#8208;HT). The PW&#8208;Mc&#8208;HT shows the mixed redox reactions between Fe2+/Fe3+ and Mn2+/Mn3+. This study reveals the root cause for the variation in PBAs' chemical composition and provides a guideline for synthesizing high&#8208;quality PBAs for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;performance magnesium organic batteries using renewable biomolecule&#8208;based cathode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) exhibit significant potential in large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their features of high volumetric capacity, resistance to dendrite formation, and abundant magnesium resources. However, the high polarity of divalent Mg2+ ions results in sluggish diffusion kinetics in conventional inorganic cathode materials, adversely affecting reversible capacity and rate performance. Organic materials such as pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetrone (PTO) and 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA), achieve rapid and reversible intercalation of magnesium ions through carbonyl enolization, but these materials are challenged by high cost, complex preparation, and poor environmental friendliness. In this study, we employ a carbonyl&#8208;rich biomass&#8208;based small molecule, emodin, as a cathode material for RMBs, achieving rapid diffusion kinetics and notable magnesium storage performance. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that two emodin molecules can form a stable structure capable of incorporating two magnesium ions when arranged with central inversion. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using biomass materials to prepare high&#8208;performance cathodes for RMBs and provides a novel approach for the development of high&#8208;performance organic cathode materials.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Based Copolymers for Templated Synthesis and Stabilization of Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Au(I)&#8208;NHC complex appended with a norbornene moiety is polymerized with another norbornene comonomer containing functionality of interest through ring&#8208;opening metathesis copolymerization to generate linear metallopolymers with highly controlled structure. These copolymers are reduced to generate multidentate polyNHC&#8208;coated Au&#8208;NPs with diverse properties and corona functionalities as well as excellent stability in aqueous media.







Abstract
Surface functionalization and colloidal stability are pivotal for numerous applications of gold nanoparticles (Au&#8208;NPs). Over the past decade, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have emerged as promising ligands for stabilizing Au&#8208;NPs owing to their ease of synthesis, structural diversity, and strong metal&#8208;ligand bonds. Here, we introduce new Au(I)&#8211;NHCcopolymer scaffolds as precursors to multidentate NHC&#8208;protected Au&#8208;NPs. Ring&#8208;opening metathesis copolymerization of a norbornene&#8208;appended Au(I)&#8722;NHC complex with another functionalized norbornene comonomer provides NHC&#8211;Au(I) copolymers with modular compositions and structures. Upon reduction, these copolymers yield multidentate polyNHC&#8208;coated Au&#8208;NPs with varied properties and corona functionalities dictated by the secondary monomer. These nanoparticles exhibit excellent size homogeneity and stability against aggregation in various buffers, cell culture media, and under exposure to electrolytes, oxidants, and exogenous thiols over extended periods. Moreover, we demonstrate post&#8208;synthetic surface functionalization reactions of polyNHC&#8722;Au&#8208;NPs while maintaining colloidal stability, highlighting their robustness and potential for applications such as bioconjugation. Overall, these findings underscore the potential of ROMP&#8208;derived NHC&#8208;containing copolymers as highly tunable and versatile multidentate ligands that may be suitable for other inorganic colloids and flat surfaces.

&lt;p&gt;A Au(I)-NHC complex appended with a norbornene moiety is polymerized with another norbornene comonomer containing functionality of interest through ring-opening metathesis copolymerization to generate linear metallopolymers with highly controlled structure. These copolymers are reduced to generate multidentate polyNHC-coated Au-NPs with diverse properties and corona functionalities as well as excellent stability in aqueous media.

         <title>Unexpected Conversion of Tyrosine into a Coumaric Acid Residue at the N&#8208;Terminal Side of an Orexin Peptide Fragment Induced by UV Irradiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Tyr17&#8722;Leu33 fragment of the orexin A peptide was investigated under simulated oxidative stress conditions, leading to the deamination of terminal tyrosine residue as an oxidation process caused by UV irradiation. The formation of the resulting mixture of E and Z coumaric acid derivatives was confirmed through HPLC&#8208;MS and NMR studies.







Abstract
The presence of reactive species exceeding the physiological self&#8208;defense mechanisms in cells and tissues, known as oxidative stress, usually leads to damage of DNA and proteins. In this work, we analyzed the impact of UV irradiation and radical species from different sources to the Tyr17&#8722;Leu33 segment of orexin A peptide, which is the minimal fragment with affinity for orexin 1 receptor. As a clear oxidation process, we detected the conversion of terminal Tyrosine residue into a mixture of E/Z coumaric acid derivatives. In fact, UV irradiation and nitrosyl radicals were found to selectively induce the deamination of tyrosine into the corresponding olefin derivative, which was confirmed by HPLC&#8208;MS and NMR investigations.

         <title>Excited&#8208;State Dynamics and Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Group Effects in Two&#8208;Photon Switchable Donor&#8208;Acceptor Stenhouse Adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;photon transformation of donor&#8208;acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASAs) through non&#8208;linear excitation into a higher singlet state. Direct detection of the upper singlet states was achieved with femtosecond resolution through the fluorescence up&#8208;conversion technique. New DASAs with varying electron acceptor groups show significant improvement in their two&#8208;photon cross&#8208;sections.







Abstract
Non&#8208;linear optical reactive systems have important applications which require highly localized effects. Recently, we reported for the first time that donor&#8208;acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASAs) have important two&#8208;photon switching properties.&#160;Here, we report on the nature of the non&#8208;linear excitation event and the resulting&#160;dynamics through femtosecond&#8208;resolved measurements. From these experiments we directly show the central role of specific higher singlet states in the initial two&#8208;photon transition step. To test the generality of the involvement of such higher states, we synthesized new two&#8208;photon switchable DASAs with varying electron accepting groups. Specifically, we&#160;detected a rapid decaying emission from the initially formed higher singlets (Sn, n&gt;1) which is followed by the indirect formation of the S1&#160;state from Sn&#8594;S1&#160;internal conversion which in turn leads to the switching reaction. Importantly, the new DASAs show up to a factor of three larger two&#8208;photon cross sections in comparison with&#160;our previously reported molecules. Computational results&#160;are consistent with the central role of specific higher singlets in the non&#8208;linear switching of DASAs at&#160;approximately 3&#8197;eV above the electronic ground state. The present results identify the key variables with respect to the non&#8208;linear photo&#8208;switching reactions of these compounds.

Deprotonated trimethylsilylethanol is an excellent nucleophile for Matteson homologations. It can be introduced in high yields and is stable under the usual reaction conditions. After two further homologation steps, the protective group is automatically cleaved off to form highly substituted tetrahydrofurans via a six&#8208;membered ring O&#8208;B coordination.

         <title>Nanosecond Hyperquenching for Electron Cryo&#8208;Microscopy Without Air&#8208;Water Interface Artifacts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method for the ultrafast vitrification of the biological assemblies is assayed by the electron cryotomography. Protein specimens prepared by this method inherently lack the spatial/structural artifacts, which derive from the surface tension at the air&#8208;water interface (AWI). Mitigating the effect of AWI artifacts is the major challenge for the high&#8208;resolution (time&#8208;resolved) electron cryo&#8208;microscopy (ECM) imaging.







Abstract
A major challenge in electron cryo&#8208;microscopy (ECM) imaging is preparing the protein specimen without the artifacts caused by the surface tension at the air&#8208;water interface (AWI). Here, we report nanosecond hyperquenching (NHQ) &#8211; a method of preparing ECM samples without AWI&#8208;bound protein macromolecules. The fast narrow sample jet impinges the eutectic propane&#8208;ethane (PET) liquid cryogen at 77&#8197;K and breaks up, forming 30&#8211;150&#8208;nm&#8208;thick vitrified films. NHQ films with the protein particles are formed directly in the PET cryogen, precluding AWI tension&#8208;driven protein adsorption, preferred orientation, subunit dissociation and denaturation. The formed film surfaces are essentially specimen&#8208;free, with a 2.7&#8208;nm&#8208;thick protein depleted layer of hyperquenched glassy water (HGW). This &#8220;surface sealing&#8221; appears to be the first essential stage of vitrification at NHQ conditions; it occurs in about 35&#8197;ps on cryogen encounter. We outline the depletion mechanism, where the growing HGW layer displaces protein particles from the surface inwards the film.

Hierarchically porous metal&#8208;organic frameworks (HP&#8208;MOFs) always present novel and advanced performances in many applications. Herein, we demonstrated a novel mechanochemical metal modulation strategy to construct the HP&#8208;MOFs. The metal modulator bearing different coordination ability from the parent metal was incorporated into the parent metal precursor via ball milling. Then, by reacting with the ligand, the metal modulator interrupted the original metal&#8208;ligand coordination and created the defect&#8208;mesopores during the solid&#8208;state transformation process, resulting in HP&#8208;MOF. Using this approach, a series of HP&#8208;MOFs were constructed. Notably, unlike the linker modulation approach, the missing&#8208;linker defects are no longer the dominant defects in these prepared HP&#8208;MOFs. Beyond this, the metal modulators can be co&#8208;assembled into the HP&#8208;MOFs, functionalizing HP&#8208;MOFs with new metal active sites. Finally, the catalytic performances of prepared hierarchically porous ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;Pd was tested, it presented superior catalytic activities towards hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes.

         <title>Base&#8208;Promoted Homolytic Aromatic Substitution (BHAS) Reactions and Hydrodehalogenations Driven by Green Light and an Iron(III)&#8208;NHC Photoredox Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we present the application of an Fe(III)&#8208;NHC complex in the intramolecular base&#8208;promoted homolytic aromatic substitution reaction. Milder reaction conditions than previously reported were employed, which tolerated functional groups like an aldehyde and ester. The reaction leads to the predominant formation of the cyclized product (CP) over the hydrodehalogenated product (HP). A mechanism is proposed, supported by extensive mechanistic studies.







Abstract
An Fe(III)&#8208;NHC complex has been employed for the green light driven catalysis of base&#8208;promoted homolytic aromatic substitution (BHAS) reactions. Tributylamine was used as a sacrificial electron donor, together with potassium carbonate as base in dimethyl sulfoxide as solvent. In contrast to previously studied photocatalysts, the excited Fe(III)&#8208;NHC complex is not reducing the arylhalide substrates. Instead, the latter are activated by &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals formed upon reductive quenching of the photocatalyst by tributylamine. Avoiding strongly reducing photocatalysts as well as strong base, these mild reaction conditions allowed for the expansion of the substrate scope to accommodate also aldehyde and ester substituents. 100&#8201;% conversion was obtained after 48&#8197;h of irradiation. In this way a wide variety of cyclized products and their corresponding hydrodehalogenated products were obtained as isolated and pure compounds, in the vast majority of cases.

         <title>Precision Stealth Nanofibers via PET&#8208;RAFT Polymerisation: Synthesis, Crystallization&#8208;driven Self&#8208;assembly and Cellular Uptake Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stealth polymer nanofibers are promising therapeutic delivery systems that suffer from challenging functionalization. In this work we harness photoinduced electron/energy transfer reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (PET&#8208;RAFT) polymerisation and crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA) to produce low length&#8208;dispersity poly(fluorenetrimethylenecarbonate)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(N&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide) (PFTMC&#8208;b&#8208;PHPMA) precision nanofibers. Fluorescent PFTMC&#8208;b&#8208;PHPMA nanofibers exhibited minimal cytotoxicity and limited cellular association, in keeping with stealth materials.







Abstract
Stealth precision polymer nanofibers show great promise as therapeutic delivery systems. However, existing systems are largely limited to poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and suffer from challenging functionalization, hampering their translation. This work develops a modular, easily functionalizable platform for biocompatible stealth nanofibers based on a combination of ring&#8208;opening polymerisation (ROP), photoinduced electron/energy transfer reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (PET&#8208;RAFT) polymerisation, and crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA). Low length&#8208;dispersity poly(fluorenetrimethylenecarbonate)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(N&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide) (PFTMC&#8208;b&#8208;PHPMA) nanofibers may be produced in a single&#8208;step via CDSA, with a length that is dependent on the PHPMA DPn. Separately, living CDSA leads to nanofibers with length control between 30&#8197;nm and ca. 700&#8197;nm. Incorporation of fluorescein into the PET&#8208;RAFT polymerization results in fluorescent PFTMC&#8208;b&#8208;PHPMA block copolymers that can undergo CDSA, forming fluorescent nanoparticles for preliminary cell studies. PFTMC&#8208;b&#8208;PHPMA nanofibers exhibited minimal toxicity to cells as well as limited cellular association, in line with previous studies on neutral polymer nanofibers. In comparison, PFTMC&#8208;b&#8208;PHPMA nanospheres exhibited no cellular association. These results indicate that the unique shape and core&#8208;crystallinity of PFTMC&#8208;b&#8208;PHPMA nanofibers ideally positions them for use as therapeutic delivery systems. Overall, the results described herein provide the basis for a modular, easily functionalizable platform for precision stealth polymer nanofibers for a variety of prospective biomedical applications.

         <title>Conjugation Effects in the Generation of Dynamic Covalent Libraries of Bis&#8208;Imines from Substituted Aromatic Aldehyde and Amine Components</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic conjugation in reactants influences the generation, selectivity and stability of bis&#8208;imines; a cross bis&#8208;imine (A1B1A2) preferentially forms over homologous bis&#8208;imines (A1B1A1 and A2B1A2) in a multi&#8208;component system generating dynamic covalent imine libraries.







Abstract
The conjugation&#8208;driven stability and reactivity of bis&#8208;imine formation from the reaction of substituted aromatic aldehydes and amines bearing electron donor and acceptor groups were studied in two approaches involving aldehydes and amines with the substituents either conjugated (para position) or non&#8208;conjugated (meta position) to the reacting functional groups. The bis&#8208;imine from the reaction of a bis&#8208;amine (B) with different types of aldehydes (A) constituted an ABA module, whereas the reaction of bis&#8208;aldehydes with different amines resulted in a BAB module. The competitive reactions were also studied for a specified bis&#8208;amine (B1 or B2) in similar conditions with a mixture of different aldehydes, and the time&#8208;dependent generations of dynamic covalent libraries were followed. The results indicated that conjugation modulated the bis&#8208;imine formation. The reaction of the conjugated bis&#8208;amine B1 with a mixture of two different aldehydes A1 and A2 favoured the formation of the bis&#8208;imine A1B1A2 involving different aldehydes. The results of the study provide insights into the effect of conjugation on the reactivity and stability of bis&#8208;imines and provide a basis for inducing selectivity features in the formation of bis&#8208;imines from different types of aldehyde and amine groups. They provide an entry into the design of dynamic covalent libraries generated from extended multicomponent systems.

         <title>Optimal Stapling of a Helical Peptide&#8208;Foldamer Hybrid Using a C&#8208;Terminal 4&#8208;Mercaptoproline Enhances Protein Surface Recognition and Cellular Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reorientation of the C&#8208;terminal proline in a peptide&#8208;oligourea hybrid foldamer was exploited to generate macrocyclic helix mimetics through Pro&#8594;cis&#8208;mercapto&#8208;proline (4MP) replacement and subsequent bis&#8208;thioether crosslinking. Applied to hDM2&#8208;p53 interaction inhibition, this approach led to cell permeable, high&#8208;affinity binders and was validated by a crystal structure of the complex.







Abstract
Structural analysis of a co&#8208;crystal of a helically&#8208;folded peptide&#8208;foldamer hybrid in complex with hDM2 E3 ubiquitin ligase, revealed a unique orientation for the C&#8208;terminal proline with the pyrrolidine ring pointing backwards in the sequence, and suggested new opportunities for macrocyclization. In particular, we found that the C&#8208;terminal prolyl residue could be replaced by its (2S,4S)&#8208;4&#8208;mercaptoprolyl analogue for optimal bisthioether crosslinking with a cysteine residue installed at position 4 in the sequence. The resulting i,i+7 stapled peptide&#8208;foldamer is a high&#8208;affinity binder to hDM2, is cell permeable and restores the p53 signalling pathway in p53wt cancer cells. The co&#8208;crystal structure of hDM2 and the stapled peptide&#8208;foldamer hybrid was determined at 1.84&#8197;&#197;, fully validating the original design and further highlighting the potential of cis&#8208;4&#8208;mercaptoproline in the context of peptide and foldamer stapling.

&lt;p&gt;Reorientation of the C-terminal proline in a peptide-oligourea hybrid foldamer was exploited to generate macrocyclic helix mimetics through Pro&#8594;&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-mercapto-proline (4MP) replacement and subsequent bis-thioether crosslinking. Applied to hDM2-p53 interaction inhibition, this approach led to cell permeable, high-affinity binders and was validated by a crystal structure of the complex.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structural analysis of a co-crystal of a helically-folded peptide-foldamer hybrid in complex with hDM2 E3 ubiquitin ligase, revealed a unique orientation for the &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-terminal proline with the pyrrolidine ring pointing backwards in the sequence, and suggested new opportunities for macrocyclization. In particular, we found that the &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-terminal prolyl residue could be replaced by its (2&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,4&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-4-mercaptoprolyl analogue for optimal bisthioether crosslinking with a cysteine residue installed at position 4 in the sequence. The resulting &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;+7 stapled peptide-foldamer is a high-affinity binder to hDM2, is cell permeable and restores the p53 signalling pathway in p53wt cancer cells. The co-crystal structure of hDM2 and the stapled peptide-foldamer hybrid was determined at 1.84&#8197;&#197;, fully validating the original design and further highlighting the potential of &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-4-mercaptoproline in the context of peptide and foldamer stapling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Facile Synthesis of N&#8208;Doped Porous Carbon Materials Derived from Bombyx Mori Silk for High&#8208;Performance Symmetric Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supercapacitor electrode: N&#8208;doped porous carbon material (BCNK) was prepared by using bombyx mori silk as carbon source, KHCO3 and melamine as activators. The symmetric supercapacitor assembled by BCNK has an energy density of 10.9 Wh kg&#8722;1, which provides a new way for the application of silk in supercapacitors.







Abstract
Heteroatom doping and structural modification can significantly improve the electrochemical properties of carbon materials, but it is difficult to achieve synchronous control of the two. To this end, N&#8208;doped porous carbon material (BCNK) was synthesized using bombyx mori silk as carbon source, melamine and KHCO3 as activators. When only melamine is added, the prepared carbon material (BCN) only increases the heteroatom content. When only KHCO3 is added, the prepared carbon material (BCK) only increases the specific surface area and pore volume. The microstructure and heteratom content of carbon materials can be controlled simultaneously by adding two activators at the same time. Electrochemical tests show that the electrochemical performance of BCNK is higher than that of BCN and BCK. It is worth mentioning that the specific surface area of BCNK is much lower than that of BCK, and the heteroatom content is higher than that of BCK, indicating that increasing the heteroatom content is more conducive to achieving excellent electrochemical performance than increasing the specific surface area. This study not only provides a new way for the application of silk in supercapacitors, but also enables researchers to re&#8208;understand the relationship between the structure and electrochemical properties of carbon materials.

         <title>Highly Diastereoselective Synthesis of Oxindole&#8208;Bearing Pyrroloindoline via Gold Catalyzed Carbophilic Carbene Transfer Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold catalyzed intermolecular dearomative cyclization of tryptamine with diazo oxindole has been achieved by utilizing L3AuCl/Ag3PO4 (L3=hexamethyl phosphane triamine) as the catalyst, yielding a series of C&#8208;3&#8208;oxindole fused pyrroloindoline products in moderate to good yields with high diastereoselectivities, which enabled a five&#8208;step synthesis of the natural product (&#177;)&#8208;folicanthine.







Abstract
A new type of gold catalyzed intermolecular dearomative cyclization reaction between diazo oxindole and tryptamine has been developed by utilizing the combination of L3AuCl/Ag3PO4 (L3=hexamethyl phosphane triamine) as the catalyst. This method allows for the facile preparation of a series of C&#8208;3&#8208;oxindole fused pyrroloindoline products in moderate to good yields with high diastereoselectivities. A plausible reaction mechanism, involving a cascade process of regioselective nucleophilic addition of the carbophilic gold carbenoid intermediate onto tryptamine, followed by an intramolecular cyclization, has been proposed, in which, the high diastereoselectivity is attributed to a preferred transition state. Moreover, three oxindole&#8208;bearing indolo[2,3&#8208;b] quinoline derivatives were synthesized through dearomative cyclization of homotryptamine derivative 4a with the respective 3&#8208;diazoindolin&#8208;2&#8208;one substrates using a similar strategy. A gram&#8208;scale experiment successfully yielded 1.95&#8197;g of 3&#8201;aa in 85&#8201;% yield with a diastereomeric ratio (dr) of 10.4/1, ultimately enabling a five&#8208;step synthesis of the natural product (&#177;)&#8208;folicanthine.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Acetylenic Scaffolds Modeling Segments of 6,6,12&#8208;Graphyne</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a combined experimental and computational study, we present the synthesis as well as redox and optical properties of small model systems representing segments of the elusive carbon allotrope 6,6,12&#8208;graphyne. These model systems are acetylenic scaffolds incorporating tetraethynylethenes (TEEs) as core units separating benzene rings.







Abstract
6,6,12&#8208;Graphyne is an all&#8208;carbon network formally generated by interspersing sp&#8208; and sp2&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms between the carbon hexagons of graphene. Tetraethynylethene (TEE) is one structural unit that can be identified as bridging the benzene rings in 6,6,12&#8208;graphyne. Here we present the synthesis by stepwise Sonogashira couplings of TEE scaffolds that can be considered as small model systems of 6,6,12&#8208;graphyne segments. Electrochemical studies of the scaffolds revealed that they are weaker electron acceptors than related, but smaller, radiaannulene oligomers that were previously studied as relevant model systems of other 6,6,12&#8208;graphyne segments. The connectivity of the TEE units in these acyclic oligomers plays a role for their acceptor strengths according to experiments and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. Moreover, optical studies reveal redshifted longest&#8208;wavelength absorptions as the oligomer length increases, but only to a small degree when moving from dimer to trimer structures. Experimental results were complemented by calculated absorption and redox properties.

         <title>Multigram Scale Synthesis of Mechanically&#8208;Interlocked Derivatives of SWNT using Mechanochemical Methods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We can make mechanically interlocked derivatives of SWNTs (MINTs) using mechanochemistry in multigram scale. The synthesis is super&#8208;fast, requires minimal amounts of solvent and works with both (6,5)&#8208;SWNTs and larger and cheaper TuballTM tubes. With this method, it becomes feasible to use MINTs in real&#8208;world applications, like the reinforcement of polymers.







Abstract
The grinding of chemical reagents enables mixing, promotes molecular collisions, and provides the thermal energy required for chemical reactions, while reducing the need for solvent (often to none) and significantly speeding up reactions. This has made mechanochemistry a powerful alternative to traditional solution chemistry. Here, we show that mechanically interlocked derivatives of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (MINTs) can be made via mechanochemistry in a multigram scale. Compared to the previously reported method in suspension, mechanochemistry allows us to reduce the amount of solvent by two orders of magnitude and the reaction time from 72&#8197;h to 5&#8197;min. The mechanochemical synthesis of MINTs is proven to work both with purified (6,5)&#8208;SWNTs and affordable TuballTM SWNTs, enabling the cheap, fast, and environmentally friendly multigram scale synthesis of MINTs. With this new synthetic methodology, we open the door to the real&#8208;world applications of MINTs in fields such as polymer composites.

         <title>Sulfide Synthesis via A Bioinspired C&#8722;S &#963;&#8208;Bond Metathesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the natural S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM) cycle, we devised and realized a &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis between the C&#8722;O bond of alcohols with thioethers. This reaction is promoted by a mixture of commonly used Lewis acids and allows fast access to various challenging thioethers from easily available ones by directly editing one alkyl group of the thioether with easily available alcohols as the new alkyl group. Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations were carried out to show a high level of resemblance to the natural SAM cycle.







Abstract
In this manuscript, inspired by the natural S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM) cycle, we devised a mixed &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis between the (sp3)C&#8722;S bond of organic sulfides with the C&#8722;O bond of alcohols. This reaction is mediated by a readily available and operationally facile mixture of AlCl3 and ZnI2, which allows fast access to various challenging organic sulfides by directly editing the (sp3)C&#8722;S bond of easily available ones. Like multiple bond metathesis, this method could also be rendered intramolecular and extended to ether (sp3)C&#8722;O bond metathesis as well as amine (sp3)C&#8722;N bond metathesis to provide saturated heterocycles such as cyclic thioethers, cyclic ethers, as well as cyclic amines. Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations were carried out to show a high level of resemblance to the natural SAM cycle. We anticipate this bioinspired design of C&#8722;S/C&#8722;O metathesis will infuse the area of a &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis with more insights and provide opportunities for further advances in areas that have been facilitated by traditional C&#8722;X bond forming reactions.

         <title>Structure&#8208;based development of a covalent inhibitor targeting Streptococcus pyogenes over Staphylococcus aureus sortase A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sortase A (SrtA), a cysteine transpeptidase critical for surface protein anchoring in Gram&#8208;positive pathogens, represents an attractive antivirulence target. While covalent SrtA inhibitors show therapeutic potential, existing compounds lack species selectivity. Through structure&#8208;guided design, we developed T10, a covalent inhibitor selectively targeting Streptococcus pyogenes SrtA (SpSrtA) over Staphylococcus aureus SrtA (SaSrtA). Molecular docking revealed that shortening a "C=C" bond in lead compound ML346 eliminated SaSrtA inhibition due to steric hindrance from W194, while maintaining SpSrtA binding. X&#8208;ray crystallography confirmed T10's covalent modification of Cys208 in SpSrtA. T10 demonstrated two fold enhanced inhibitory potency and species&#8208;specific disruption of M&#8208;protein anchoring and biofilm formation in Streptococcus pyogenes, without affecting Staphylococcus aureus viability. In a Galleria mellonella infection model, T10 conferred potent protection against lethal infection. This work demonstrates the development of narrow&#8208;spectrum antivirulence agents through a structure&#8208;based rational strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Reusable CuO NPs Catalyzed Chemodivergent Transfer Hydrogenation of Azoarenes to Hydrazoarenes and Aniline Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective synthesis of different products from a substrate employing a single catalyst by altering the reaction conditions is challenging. Herein, easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize and cheap CuO NPs catalyzed chemodivergent transfer hydrogenation (TH) of azoarenes to hydrazoarene and aniline derivatives using ammonia borane (AB) under mild condition is disclosed. The practical applicability of the protocol was demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale synthesis of hydrazo and aniline derivatives as well as by the reduction of few commercially used dyes such as methyl red, sudan I, sudan III and solvent yellow 7. Several control experiment and deuterium labelling experiments&#160;were performed to understand the reaction mechanism. Moreover, the catalyst can be recycled up to six times without considerable loss of catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>A Bivalent Iridium(III) Complex Toolkit for Mitochondrial DNA G&#8208;Quadruplex&#8208;Targeted Theranostics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) is an important diagnostic and therapeutic target in cancers, but the development of theranostic probes for subcellular G4s remains challenging. In this work, we report three G4&#8208;targeted theranostic probes by conjugating a pyridostatin&#8208;derived G4 ligand to G4&#8208;specific iridium(III) complexes with desirable photophysical properties. These probes showed specifically enhanced luminescence to mitochondrial G4 in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Of note, complex 3 exhibited NIR emission and the ability to discriminate TNBC cells and normal breast cells. Furthermore, these probes showed much higher PDT toxicity in TNBC cells through ROS&#8208;induced apoptosis, in which complex 3exhibited type I/II hybrid PDT effect with the potential to overcome hypoxia. These results demonstrate that these complexes are multicolor and modular phototheranostic probes for DNA G4s. We believe that this work offers a multifunctional theranostic toolkit for unmasking subcellular DNA G&#8208;quadruplex functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidative Neutralisation of Sulfur&#8208;Based Chemical Warfare Agents Mediated by a Lipase: From Batch to Flow Reactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The simulants of the toxic and persistent blister agent sulfur mustard (CEES) and organophosphorous nerve agent VX (PhX) are neutralized with high selectivity by peracetic acid under batch and flow conditions. The hazardous peracetic acid is safely generated &#8216;on demand&#8217; from AcOEt and aq. H2O2, assisted by the supported lipase CALB.







Abstract
The sulfur&#8208;containing chemical warfare agents sulfur mustard HD and nerve agent VX are highly toxic and persistent in the environment. Therefore, their neutralisation requires harsh oxidation conditions, but also precise selectivity. Here we report the safe and effective detoxification of surrogates CEES and PhX by selective oxidation of the sulfur atom by generating peracetic acid from AcOEt and aq. H2O2 assisted by the supported lipase CALB. Morever, it is possible to perform these neutralisations with safe &#8216;on demand&#8217; generation of AcOOH in a flow system by using a packed bed reactor containing the supported biocatalyst.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Switchable Molecular Glues for Reversible Control of Protein Function</title>

         <dc:description>
This work presents a modular chemo&#8208;optogenetic system using azobenzene&#8208;based photoswitchable molecular glues (sMGs) to reversibly control protein dimerization/proximity. This system enables reversible control of protein function using orthogonal green/blue and red/blue light







Abstract
Chemically induced dimerization/proximity (CID/CIP) systems controlled by chemical dimerizers (also known as molecular glues) provide valuable means for understanding and manipulating complex, dynamic biological systems. In this study, we present the development of versatile chemo&#8208;optogenetic systems utilizing azobenzene&#8208;based photoswitchable molecular glues (sMGs) for reversible protein dimerization controlled by visible light. These systems allow multiple cycles of light&#8208;induced dimerization, overcoming the limitations of irreversible photolysis in previous systems. Through optimizing photoswitch properties and linker strategies, we achieved efficient and reversible control using blue, green, and red light. We demonstrate that these systems enable rapid and reversible control of protein function in&#8197;vitro and in cells. The findings represent a significant advancement in chemo&#8208;optogenetics, offering opportunities to expand applications requiring precise spatiotemporal regulation of dynamic biological processes.

PdAg nanoalloys (NAs) are successfully synthesized via a facile visible&#8208;light&#8208;assisted liquid&#8208;phase method. The optimized one&#8208;dimensional (1D) PdAg NA, abundant in defects, exhibits exceptional electrochemical properties in both glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) and ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR). Furthermore, this study introduces controllable strategies for defect generation in catalysts and clarifies the correlation between defect structure and catalytic efficiency.







Abstract
The development of Pd&#8208;based bimetallic nanoalloys (NAs) with abundant active sites for achieving highly efficient electrocatalysis in alcohol oxidation deserves continuous attention. Herein, we utilized a facile visible&#8208;light&#8208;assisted liquid&#8208;phase method involving adjusting reaction time to generate active sites, successfully synthesizing one&#8208;dimensional (1D) PdAg NAs rich in defects. The optimized 1D PdAg NA exhibits remarkable electrochemical activity, stability, and antipoisonous properties in glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) and ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR), far exceeding pure Pd and commercial Pd/C catalysts. Notably, compared to glycerol oxidation (1496&#8197;mA&#8201;mg&#8722;1Pd and 4.13&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), the optimized PdAg NA demonstrated higher mass activity (2990&#8197;mA&#8201;mg&#8722;1Pd) and specific activity (7.86&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in ethanol oxidation. In summary, this work may provide a strategy for designing low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts enriched with defects, thereby promoting the development of high&#8208;performance alcohol oxidation reactions.

         <title>A Non&#8208;Volatile Pro&#8208;Dicamba Herbicide Inspired by Meclofenoxate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 15, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dicamba is a long&#8208;successful herbicide with an Achille's heel, namely its propensity to volatilize, drift and burn neighboring plants. Here we develop a non&#8208;volatile and efficacious pro&#8208;herbicide for dicamba by an ester coupling of 2&#8208;dimethylaminoethanol that is stable but becomes hydrolyzed once inside plants.







Abstract
Dicamba is a popular herbicide with rising use but is also notorious for volatility drift. Inspired by meclofenoxate, which we show to be highly herbicidal, we developed a derivative of dicamba with an ester&#8208;bond to 2&#8208;dimethylaminoethanol. It remained herbicidal but is non&#8208;volatile, entering plants intact and hydrolyzing inside leaves to dicamba and 2&#8208;dimethylaminoethanol. This pro&#8208;dicamba is compatible with the relatively novel dicamba monooxygenase tolerance technology, suggesting pro&#8208;dicamba might be a suitable, non&#8208;volatile replacement for dicamba.

         <title>Intramolecular Inhibition by Imidazole in Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrolysis of Protected Carbohydrates</title>

Unexpected inhibition of the acid&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis of the 5,6&#8208;O&#8208;isopropylidene group in 3&#8208;O&#8208;protected D&#8208;gluco&#8208; and D&#8208;allofuranose derivatives is observed. Structural and conformational analyses elucidate critical interactions between the isopropylidene&#8208;protected dioxolane ring and imidazole rings, providing insights into the interplay of carbohydrate O&#8208;protecting groups and steric effects on reaction mechanisms.







Abstract
The present study reveals an unexpected anomaly observed in the acid&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis of the 5,6&#8208;O&#8208;isopropylidene group in 3&#8208;O&#8208;protected D&#8208;gluco&#8208; and D&#8208;allofuranose derivatives. Although the removal of the 5,6&#8208;O&#8208;isopropylidene protecting group is typically rapid and quantitative under acidic conditions, an unexpected inhibition of this reaction is observed for the two C3&#8208;epimers, 3&#8208;O&#8208;imidazole sulfonyl moiety. X&#8208;ray data show a two&#8208;faced imidazole ring orientation in the crystal, while solution state NOE data reveal a critical interaction type between the isopropylidene and the imidazole rings. Advanced conformational searches coupled with ab initio molecular modeling illuminate and explain the NMR and kinetic data and lay the groundwork for the most plausible mechanism of this unprecedented inhibition. These results provide valuable insights into the cross&#8208;coupling of carbohydrate O&#8208;protecting groups and shed light on how specific ring orientations and steric effects can trigger the inhibition of an otherwise easily feasible reaction, such as an acid&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis.

         <title>Substrate Specificity of Adenine&#8208;Cu&#8208;PO4 Nanozyme: Ascorbic Acid Oxidation and Selective Cytotoxicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 15, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adenine&#8208;Cu&#8208;PO4 nanozyme, synthesized with Cu2+ as an active site and adenine as a linker in phosphate&#8208;buffered saline, specifically catalyzes ascorbic acid (AA) oxidation to dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA), and concurrently produced ROS could efficiently triggers intratumor oxidative stress to induce tumor cell death.







Abstract
Though nanozymes are becoming promising alternatives to natural enzymes due to their superior properties, constructing nanozyme with high specificity is still a great challenge. Herein, with Cu2+ as an active site and adenine as a ligand, Adenine&#8208;Cu&#8208;PO4 is synthesized in phosphate&#8208;buffered saline. As an oxidase mimic, Adenine&#8208;Cu&#8208;PO4 could selectively catalyze oxidation of ascorbic acid (AA) to dehydroascorbic acid, but not universal substrates (3,3&#8217;,5,5&#8217;&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), 2,2&#8217;&#8208;azino&#8208;bis (3&#8208;ethylbenzthiazoline&#8208;6&#8208;sulfonic acid) (ABTS) and 2,4&#8208;dichlorophenol (2,4&#8208;DP)), small biomolecules (dopamine, glutathione, glucose, galactose), other vitamins (vitamin A acid, vitamin B1, vitamin K1) and even dithiothreitol (a common interference of AA). Such the specific AA catalytic oxidation is revealed that Adenine&#8208;Cu&#8208;PO4 selectively binds with AA through hydrogen bonds, accompanied with catalyzing AA oxidation, and concurrently O2 transferring to H2O2 via O2&#8901;&#8722;, further to H2O via &#8901;OH. Based on the produced reactive oxygen species, with AA as a pro&#8208;oxidant, Adenine&#8208;Cu&#8208;PO4 nanozyme efficiently triggers severe intratumor oxidative stress to induce tumor cell death. This work opens a new avenue to design intrinsic nanozymes with high specificity, and also presents a promising application in the field of AA oxidation induced cancer therapy.

         <title>Silicon&#8208;Based Linkers for Tunable Acid&#8208;Sensitive Drug Release from Polymeric Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 15, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by silyl protecting groups we have developed silicon based linkers having both a hydroxyl containing drug and a polymerizable group. Upon polymerization nanoparticles are formed from which the drug can be released under acidic conditions. This opens up possibilities for future use of these nanoparticles in treatment of diseases. As a model we have studied the release of gemcitabine.







Abstract
Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) may benefit from a carrier to improve their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Core&#8208;crosslinked polymeric micelles (CCPMs) are carriers for hydrophobic small molecule APIs. In CCPMs, APIs are generally covalently coupled to the core of the micelles by use of a linker, which can be tailored to adjust the release rate of the API. Acid triggered release is promising because of local acidic environment in the tissue of interest, and expected uptake via endocytosis. In the present study, silyl&#8208;based linkers were synthesized, and attached to gemcitabine as model API to investigate the tunability of release by introduction of different substituents. Attachment was achieved via an Si ether bond, with the linker coupled to the primary alcohol functionality on gemcitabine. By varying the substituents on the silyl atom, we could vary the release half&#8208;life (t1/2) of native gemcitabine from &lt;1&#8197;hour&#8211;&gt;96&#8197;hours at pH&#8197;5.0 at 37&#8201;&#176;C, compared to a t1/2 of 24&#8211;&gt;240&#8197;hours at pH&#8197;7.4 at 37&#8201;&#176;C, respectively. The steric hinderance caused by substituents contributed to an increase of t1/2 at pH&#8197;5.0, as the largest substituents resulted in the slowest release. Extension to other APIs and other carriers is clearly possible.

         <title>Catalytic Reduction of Imines with Silylformates: Formation of Silyl Carbamates through CO2 Insertion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 15, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new reactivity of silylformates, an emerging class of surrogates of hydrosilanes, is revealed in the presence of imines. Using ruthenium catalysts, and lithium iodide as a co&#8208;catalyst, imines are shown to undergo hydrocarboxysilylation by formal insertion of CO2 to the N&#8722;Si bond of an intermediate silyl amine to yield silyl carbamates in excellent yields.







Abstract
Silylformates are emerging surrogates of hydrosilanes, able to reduce carbonyl groups in transfer hydrosilylation reactions, with the concomitant release of CO2. In this work, a new reactivity is revealed for silylformates, in the presence of imines. Using ruthenium catalysts, and lithium iodide as a co&#8208;catalyst, imines are shown to undergo hydrocarboxysilylation by formal insertion of CO2 to the N&#8722;Si bond of silyl amine to yield silyl carbamates in excellent yields.

Two pairs of AIE&#8208;active TADF enantiomers were successfully designed and synthesized through isomer engineering. Notably, the CP&#8208;OLED devices, fabricated by solution&#8208;process, exhibited vivid CP&#8208;EL signals with the EQEmax of 2.7&#8201;%/10.2&#8201;%, low efficiency roll&#8208;off of 3.7&#8201;%/16.7&#8201;% at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 and |gEL| values of 6.73&#215;10&#8722;4/1.19&#215;10&#8722;3, respectively.







Abstract
Circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) have significant promise for naked&#8208;eye 3D displays. However, most devices are fabricated using vacuum deposition technology, and development of efficient solution&#8208;processed CP&#8208;OLEDs, particularly those exhibiting low efficiency roll&#8208;off, remains a formidable challenge. This research successfully designed and synthesized two pairs of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) enantiomers through isomer engineering, namely (R/S)&#8208;N&#8208;5&#8208;TPA and (R/S)&#8208;N&#8208;4&#8208;TPA, which features fifth and fourth substitution sites of phthalimide (acceptor) by tri&#8208;phenylamine (donor), respectively. Both molecules displayed aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties. Notably, the CP&#8208;OLED devices, fabricated by solution&#8208;process, exhibited vivid blue&#8208;green and green emission with the maximum current efficiency of 7.4 and 29.6&#8197;cd A&#8722;1, the external quantum efficiency of 2.7&#8201;% and 10.2&#8201;%, and the low efficiency roll&#8208;off of 3.7&#8201;% and 16.7&#8201;%. Moreover, these devices demonstrated CP&#8208;EL signals with gEL values of +6.61&#215;10&#8722;4 /&#8722;6.84&#215;10&#8722;4 and +1.13&#215;10&#8722;3/&#8722;1.25&#215;10&#8722;3, respectively.

         <title>Fluorinated&#8208;Quinoxaline Based Non&#8208;Fused Electron Acceptors Enables Efficient As&#8208;Cast Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 15, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new nonfused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (NFREAs) namely L19 and L21 were designed and synthesized. Near 11.5&#8201;% binary as&#8208;cast device and approching 18&#8201;% ternary device efficiencies were achieved with single&#8208;junction solar cells based on electron acceptor of fluorinated L21.







Abstract
Non&#8208;fused electron acceptors have obtained increasing curiosity in organic solar cells (OSCs) thanks to simple synthetic route and versatile chemical modification capabilities. However, non&#8208;fused acceptors with varying quinoxaline core and as&#8208;cast device have rarely been explored, and the molecular structure&#8208;photovoltaic performance relationship of such acceptors remains unclear. Herein, two non&#8208;fused acceptors L19 and L21 with thienyl substituted non&#8208;fluorinated/fluorinated quinoxaline core were developed via five&#8208;step synthesis. Compared with L19, L21 with F&#8208;containing quinoxaline exhibited higher molar extinction coefficient, boosted charge mobility, improved exciton dissociation, more ordered molecular stacking and optimized film morphology. Thereafter, a notable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.45&#8201;% could be obtained for the as&#8208;cast PBDB&#8208;T&#8201;:&#8201;L21 &#8208;based device, which is significantly better than the device based on PBDB&#8208;T&#8201;:&#8201;L19 (8.68&#8201;%). Furthermore, PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6&#8201;:&#8201;L21&#8208;based ternary devices were fabricated and exhibited the highest PCE of 17.81&#8201;%. This work discloses that the introduction of electron&#8208;withdrawing fluorinated quinoxaline core and appropriate side&#8208;chain engineering can play an important role in improving the performance of as&#8208;cast solar cell devices.

A one&#8208;pot synthetic method has been developed for stable iridium(III) radical complexes via in&#8208;situ metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand electron transfer, which have been characterized using structural, electrochemical, and spectroscopic techniques. A weak antiferromagnetic spin&#8208;spin interaction between the radical centers has been observed and validated through theoretical calculations. Additionally, a novel template synthesis of a diazotate complex derived from a bisazo&#8208;aromatic precursor is reported.







Abstract
Two &#960;&#8208;radical complexes containing bisazo&#8208;aromatic&#8208;centered radical anion (1&#8901;&#8722;) were synthesized through in&#8208;situ electron transfer from metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand using [IrI] and 2&#8208;(2&#8208;Pyridylazo)azobenzene (1) in inert hydrocarbon solvent. These are characterized as diradical [IrIII(1&#8901;&#8722;)2]+ [2]+ and monoradical [IrIII(1&#8901;&#8722;)Cl2(PPh3)] 3. In contrast, a rare metal&#8208;mediated hydrolytic cleavage of the C(sp2)&#8722;N bond occurred in protic solvent resulting in quaternary radical complex [IrIII(1&#8901;&#8722;)(1&#8242;)(PPh3)]+ (4)+. This provides an easy way to synthesize stable unsubstituted pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;diazotate (1&#8242;), an otherwise unstable organic template. Theoretical scrutiny has been performed at (U)B3LYP/6&#8211;31G(d,p)/LANL2DZ level to explore the origin of redox and optical properties in radical complexes. Magnetic study of [2]+ reveals that a weak antiferromagnetic (AF) spin&#8208;communication (J = &#8722;4.39&#8197;cm&#8722;1) exists between two radicals, leading to an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state. Broken symmetry density functional theory (BS&#8208;DFT) calculations were carried out to probe the nature of antiferromagnetic exchange interaction between the two radical centers in species [2]+. This method has been employed with different basis functionals (BP86, BLYP, OLYP, TPSS0, TPSSh, &#969;b97D and B3LYP) to comprehend the nature of the exchange in [2]+. The best result is obtained for pure functional OLYP with a J value &#8722;8.4&#8197;cm&#8722;1.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Oxidation of Methane to Methanol on a Zeolitic Octahedral Metal Oxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 15, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methane oxidation to methanol was efficiently catalyzed a zeolitic octahedral metal oxide based on cobalt vanadotungstate at a low temperature without co&#8208;reductants. The hydroxyl&#8208;based active species generated in the V and Co sites in the micropore of the catalyst, which selectively oxidized methane to form methanol.







Abstract
Direct oxidation of methane to methanol utilizing molecular oxygen under mild conditions is an important yet challenging process due to the difficulty in activating of methane under such conditions. In this research, we report on zeolitic octahedral metal oxides based on cobalt vanadotungstates, which act as the catalysts for the oxidation of methane using molecular oxygen as the oxidant without co&#8208;reductants at a low temperature of 90&#8201;&#176;C even as low as 60&#8201;&#176;C. This catalytic process results in the high&#8208;yield production of methanol as the primary product. The micropores within the catalyst are critical for achieving high activity in the reaction, in which molecular oxygen is activated. The active species in the reaction are found to be hydroxyl&#8208;based. Both VO5 with reduced V4+ and Co2+ are crucial for generating the active species for the reaction.

         <title>Deciphering the Role of Crown&#8208;ether Receptor Orientation in C&#8208;H Oxidation Catalyzed by Supramolecular Nonheme FeIV(O) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 15, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding how modification of receptor position and orientation in a supramolecular catalyst affects its efficiency is key for rational catalyst design but still underexplored. Herein, we quantified the impact of different receptor orientations on the C&#8722;H oxidation efficiency by supramolecular Fe(IV)=O complexes. Overall, their efficiency is similar but some changes in the selectivity profile are observed.







Abstract
The outstanding efficiency and selectivity of enzymatic reactions, such as C&#8722;H oxidation by nonheme iron oxygenases, stems from a precise control of substrate positioning inside the active site. The resulting proximity between a specific moiety (a certain C&#8722;H bond) and the reactant (a FeIV(O) active species) translates into higher rates and selectivity, that can be in part replicated also with artificial supramolecular catalysts. However, structural modification of the position and orientation of the binding site both in enzymes and in artificial catalysts often leads to significant variations in reactivity that can be difficult to rationalize due to the system&#8216;s complexity. Herein, we quantitatively analyzed the impact of such a structural modification (namely receptor orientation) on the C&#8722;H oxidation reactivity (kinetics, Effective Molarity) and selectivity by comparing simple supramolecular FeIV(O) models. Overall, we did not observe significant differences in reaction rates, but we noticed slight changes in the selectivity profile. These results indicate that, when a crown&#8208;ether is employed as a recognition site, the key ingredient for enhanced reactivity is the presence of the supramolecular receptor itself rather than its exact orientation, providing a guide for the rational design of supramolecular catalysts.

The present work reveals a mechanistically and conceptually rich electrochemical approach to the construction of CN&#8208;functionalized heterocycles from easily available substrates using the symbiosis of anodic oxidation of SCN anion to cyanide and cascade cyclization with Shono&#8208;type oxidation of saturated C&#8722;N bonds to C=N bonds.







Abstract
The electrochemically mediated cyanation/annulation process with in&#8197;situ cyanide ion generation from NH4SCN and multi&#8208;step oxidative construction of CN&#8208;functionalized heterocycles from easily available &#945;&#8208;amino esters and pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehydes has been discovered. Depending on the nature of the &#945;&#8208;amino ester, 1&#8208;cyano&#8208;imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylates, 3&#8208;alkyl&#8208; and 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines&#8208;1&#8208;carbonitriles, and the first reported 4&#8208;oxo&#8208;4H&#8208;pyrido[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazine&#8208;1&#8208;carbonitriles were obtained. The electrosynthesis is carried out in an undivided electrochemical cell under constant current conditions. The success of the discovered electrochemical synthesis is based on the combination of two anodic processes: oxidation of SCN anion to CN anion and oxidation of C&#8722;N bonds to C=N bonds during heterocycle construction. Mechanistic studies based on CV measurements, and control experiments confirm the generation of [CN] species from NH4SCN with subsequent addition to an imine formed from &#945;&#8208;amino esters and pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehyde. Computational analysis suggests that for reactive intermediates from glycine esters, the subsequent 5&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization leading to 1&#8208;cyano&#8208;imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylates is more favourable and the 6&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization leading to 4&#8208;oxo&#8208;4H&#8208;pyrido[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazine&#8208;1&#8208;carbonitriles is less favourable. For &#945;&#8208;amino esters with alkyl or aryl substituents, both cyclization pathways are relatively thermodynamically possible. The leading 4&#8208;oxo&#8208;4H&#8208;pyrido[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazine&#8208;1&#8208;carbonitrile showed high fungicidal activity against phytopathogenic fungi.

         <title>Microbial&#8208;induced Synthesis of nano NiFe LDH for High&#8208;efficiency Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 15, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiFe&#8208;LDH catalysts were synthesized using the microbial&#8208;induced mineralization method, which results in formation of a relatively homogeneous rod shell structure on the nickel foam surface, acceleration of the formation of nanosheets, and modulation of the electronic structure of nanosheets. This study provides new insights into microbial in&#8197;situ mineralization&#8208;induced microstructural changes in catalysts for the OER.







Abstract
NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) currently are the most efficient catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline environments. However, the development of high&#8208;performance low cost OER electrocatalysts using straightforward strategies remains a significant challenge. In this study, we describe an innovative microbial mineralization&#8208;based method for in&#8197;situ&#8208;induced preparation of NiFe LDH nanosheets loaded on nickel foam and demonstrate that this material serves as an efficient oxygen evolution electrocatalyst. In the microbial mineralization process, bacteria adhere to electrode materials and promote the surface nucleation of nanomaterials when metal ions are present. Specifically, our findings indicate that biomineralization accelerates the formation and regulation of NiFe LDH. The new electrocatalyst displays excellent OER performance, with a small overpotential of 220&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope down to 38.6&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 in alkaline solution. The remarkable OER performance of the microbial mineralization&#8208;derived electrocatalyst is attributed to the synergistic effect of NiFe LDH and a bacterial&#8208;specific surface area that contains multiple active sites. This study has uncovered a new approach for the assembly of NiFe LDH that relies on biomineralization to bring about morphological and structural modification of LDH nanosheets.

         <title>Mechanochemical Deracemization: A Sustainable Approach to Enantiopurity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 15, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical deracemization (MCDR) is presented as a new, general and sustainable approach to obtain enantiomerically pure compounds. By combining ball milling with deracemization, various functionalities such as ketones, isoindolinones, imines, esters and even an inorganic compound are successfully deracemized. High enantiomeric excesses (ee) are achieved, while reaction time is reduced by up to 97&#8201;% and solvent consumption by up to 100&#8201;%.







Abstract
We introduce mechanochemical deracemization (MCDR) as a novel strategy for obtaining enantiopure compounds. This study demonstrates the successful transposition of six archetypical deracemization reactions from a solvent&#8208;based to a solvent&#8208;minimized ball milling environment. The scope includes a ketone, isoindolinones, imines, an ester, and an inorganic compound, all of which deracemized successfully. Key parameters such as milling material, ball number and size, the use of a bulk material and liquid&#8208;assisted grinding (LAG) were systematically investigated, revealing their crucial role. Quantitative enantiomeric excesses (ee) were achieved, while reaction times were reduced by up to 97&#8201;% and solvent consumption by as much as 100&#8201;%. This work establishes MCDR as a versatile, sustainable pathway to enantiopure compounds. By highlighting the generalizability of this approach and its huge potential for minimizing waste, this study provides the foundation for future advancements in mechanochemical deracemization.

         <title>Under&#8208;strain Synergistic Oscillatory Twisting Manipulates the Bifunction in Rubrene Crystal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 15, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a statistic strategy over sufficient ab initio molecular dynamics samplings and for the first time uncovers that synergistic oscillatory twisting of neighboring under&#8208;strain monomers manipulates the experimentally observed bifunction of rubrene crystal. A general rule for how synergistic oscillatory twisting modulates the conversion between singlet fission and triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation and its temperature dependence are discussed.







Abstract
Photophysical properties of condensed systems generally originate from collective contributions of all components in their stochastically fluctuated structures and are strongly influenced under strain of chromophores. To precisely identify how the stochastically fluctuated monomers synergistically manipulate the properties, we propose a statistic strategy over sufficient ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) samplings and for the first time uncover that synergistic oscillatory twisting (SOT) of neighboring under&#8208;strain monomers manipulates the bifunction of rubrene crystal. The under&#8208;strain trunk SOT can regulate both singlet fission (SF) and triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA), enabling their coexistence and dominance switching by dynamically modulating the matching of excitation energies. A general rule is that small amplitude of SOT maintains the crystal TTA, while the large one boosts SF and the SF function occurs only when two neighboring monomers simultaneously have the twisting angles larger than the critical one. Temperature can govern the twisting amplitudes, thus manipulating the bifunction. These findings rationalize the experimentally observed temperature&#8208;modulated bifunction of rubrene crystal from statistical insights and proposes a combined strain&#8208;fluctuation strategy for engineering the bifunctionality of materials.

         <title>In Vitro Selection of Collagen&#8208;Binding Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Containing Genetically Encoded Mussel&#8208;Inspired Adhesive Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 15, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have incorporated an artificial amino acid found in marine mussels, L&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), into a fusion library of random and known vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) sequences and identified a collagen&#8208;binding VEGF by in&#8197;vitro selection.







Abstract
Protein immobilization technology is important in medical and industrial applications. We previously reported all&#8208;in&#8208;one in&#8197;vitro selection, wherein a collagen&#8208;binding vascular endothelial growth factor (CB&#8208;VEGF) was identified from a fusion library of random and VEGF sequences. However, its interaction chemistry is mainly limited to the interaction established by the 20 canonical amino acids. Herein, we incorporated an adhesive non&#8208;natural amino acid found in marine mussels, L&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), into the library for all&#8208;in&#8208;one in&#8197;vitro selection. After selection, we identified DOPA&#8208;containing CB&#8208;VEGF. CB&#8208;VEGF binds to collagen with an apparent dissociation constant of 2&#8197;nM; na&#239;ve VEGF does not bind to collagen. The collagen&#8208;binding peptide domain of CB&#8208;VEGF (CB&#8208;peptide) exhibited stronger binding to collagen than a mutant peptide (substitution from DOPA to tyrosine), indicating the importance of DOPA to collagen binding. The collagen&#8208;binding affinity of CB&#8208;VEGF is 10&#8208;fold higher than that of CB&#8208;peptide, suggesting that the collagen&#8208;binding ability of CB&#8208;VEGF is not due to the additive function of CB&#8208;peptide to VEGF, but is synergistic. Furthermore, increased cell growth was observed on CB&#8208;VEGF&#8208;treated collagen surfaces, not VEGF&#8208;treated collagen surfaces. Thus, integrating all&#8208;in&#8208;one in&#8197;vitro selection and DOPA incorporation shows promise in generating adhesive proteins on solid supports.

ZJNU&#8208;402 achieves a remarkable C3H8 adsorption capacity and selectivity values of 375 for C3H8/CH4 and 31 for C2H6/CH4. This innovation enables efficient one&#8208;step purification, particularly in separating C3H8/C2H6/CH4 mixtures, yielding high&#8208;purity methane.







Abstract
The advancement of high&#8208;value CH4 purification technology within the natural gas industry is paramount for industrial processes. Herein, we constructed ZJNU&#8208;402, a new porous material characterized by permanent porosity, as an effective adsorbent for separating C3H8/CH4 and C2H6/CH4 mixtures. The findings reveal an outstanding C3H8 adsorption capacity of 68&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a moderate C2H6 adsorption rate of 42&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1, with a notably lower CH4 adsorption rate of 11&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1. Noteworthy is the exceptional selectivity of ZJNU&#8208;402 for C3H8/CH4 and C2H6/CH4, standing at 375 and 31, respectively, surpassing many previously documented high&#8208;performance adsorbents and breaking the traditional trade&#8208;off between adsorption capacity and separation selectivity. Adsorption heat calculations show that compared with CH4 molecules, C3H8 and C2H6 molecules form stronger bonds with the skeleton, resulting in excellent separation performance. In addition, the breakthrough experiment of ZJNU&#8208;402 can also completely separate the ternary component C3H8/C2H6/CH4 mixture to obtain 99.95&#8201;% high&#8208;purity methane. At the same time, ZJNU&#8208;402 also has excellent structural stability, excellent recyclability, and low isosteric adsorption heat. Consequently, ZJNU&#8208;402 exhibits substantial potential for augmenting the efficacy of natural gas enrichment processes.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8208;Type Cyclobisbiphenylenecarbonyls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 15, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclobisbiphenylenecarbonyl (CBBC) represents a readily available figure&#8208;eight molecule. Herein, we prepared ten donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type CBBC derivatives with changing the donor substituents and their substituent positions to systematically investigate the structure&#8211;property relationship. The functionalization of the para&#8208;positions of the carbonyl groups resulted in better tunability of emission colors rather than meta&#8208;functionalization, whose color variation ranges from light blue to red.







Abstract
The scalable synthesis of figure&#8208;eight &#960;&#8208;systems is challenging for the conventional bottom&#8208;up approach. We have recently reported that the oxidative inner&#8208;bond cleavage of commercially available dibenzo[g,p]chrysene efficiently furnishes a figure&#8208;eight &#960;&#8208;acceptor, cyclobisbiphenylenecarbonyl (CBBC), in large quantity. Furthermore, its donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type derivative with four N&#8208;carbazolyl substituents at the meta&#8208;positions of the carbonyl groups exhibited thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with a high |gCPL| value of 1.0&#215;10&#8722;2. Herein, we synthesized nine donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type CBBC derivatives by changing the donor substituents and their positions. Compared to previously reported carbazole&#8208;substituted CBBC, tetramethylcarbazole&#8208; and 9,10&#8208;dihydro&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethylacridine&#8208;substituted derivatives exhibited enhanced emission quantum yields and accelerated reverse intersystem crossing. The functionalization of the para&#8208;positions of the carbonyl groups resulted in better tunability of emission colors rather than meta&#8208;functionalization, whose color variation ranges from light blue to red. The incorporation of bulky substituents at the meta&#8208;positions of the carbonyl groups induced the conformational change to a distorted ring structure. Investigation of the substituent effect on the chiroptical properties revealed that the introduction of less bulky donor units such as carbazole at the meta&#8208;positions of the carbonyl groups is effective in achieving high |gCPL| values.

         <title>Helical Supramolecular Polymers Formed via Head&#8208;to&#8208;Tail Host&#8208;Guest Complexation of Chiral Bisporphyrin Monomers with Trinitrofluorenone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 15, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intermolecular host&#8208;guest complexation of a bisporphyrin&#8208;TNF head&#8208;to&#8208;tail monomer possessing a chiral binaphthyl linker was employed to construct helically twisted supramolecular polymers. Atomic force microscopy revealed well&#8208;defined right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed helical morphologies, with the helicity governed by the axial chirality of the binaphthyl linker.







Abstract
The intermolecular host&#8208;guest complexation of head&#8208;to&#8208;tail monomers consisting of cleft&#8208;shaped bisporphyrin and trinitrofluorenone units connected by a chiral binaphthyl linker was employed to construct helically twisted supramolecular polymers. Results from 1H NMR, diffusion&#8208;ordered NMR spectroscopy, and viscometry experiments revealed that the supramolecular polymerization of these monomers follows a ring&#8208;chain competition mechanism. The introduction of bulky substituents at the linker significantly suppressed the formation of macrocyclic oligomers, whereas smaller alkyl chains facilitated the formation of the cyclic form. The chirally twisted structures of the supramolecular polymers were confirmed using circular dichroism spectroscopy. Atomic force microscopy revealed that the (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;configurations of the binaphthyl linkers induced right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed helical structures, respectively, in the supramolecular polymer chains. The absence of cooperativity in the supramolecular copolymerization of (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;1&#8201;a resulted in the formation of stereo&#8208;random supramolecular copolymers.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Photooxidative N&#8208;Acylation of Azoles with Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 15, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photosensitizer&#8208;free and metal&#8208;free C&#8722;N coupling of aldehydes with azoles was described. The coupling reagent was directly excited by light to obtain the product in high yield, and this strategy was successfully applied to gram&#8208;scale reactions and late&#8208;modification of various drug molecules and natural products.







Abstract
A catalyst&#8208;free photochemical N&#8208;acylation of azoles with aldehydes has been developed using inexpensive BrCCl3 as the oxidant. This transition&#8208;metal&#8208; and photocatalyst&#8208;free amidation proceeded efficiently with a wide variety of substrates to give the corresponding N&#8208;acylazoles, including for the late modification of pharmaceutically active molecules, and on a gram&#8208;scale.

A supramolecular fluorescent material is constructed by using double&#8208;cavity twisted cucurbit[14]uril (tQ[14]) and positively charged Astrazon Pink FG (APFG) based on the non&#8208;covalent host&#8208;guest interaction. The intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect induces the APFG@tQ[14] probe to emit a strong orange&#8208;red fluorescence. And the probe is successfully applied to multi&#8208;channel imaging of HK2 cells.







Abstract
In this study, a supramolecular fluorescent material was constructed by using double&#8208;cavity twisted cucurbit[14]uril (tQ[14]) and positively charged Astrazon Pink FG (APFG) based on the non&#8208;covalent host&#8208;guest interaction for the first time. The thermodynamic parameters of the APFG@tQ[14] in aqueous solution were determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), the results indicated that the spontaneous assembly of APFG@tQ[14] is mainly driven by enthalpy. The intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect induced the APFG@tQ[14] probe to emit a strong orange&#8208;red fluorescence. Due to its good optical properties and low toxicity, APFG@tQ[14] was successfully applied to multi&#8208;channel imaging of HK2 cells. This demonstrates the great potential of APFG@tQ[14] in labeling and tracking living cells.

         <title>Transition Metal Based Spin&#8208;Tuned Charge Transfer in Single&#8208;Molecule Junctions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 15, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The article presents an investigation into the conductivity of single&#8208;molecule wires featuring a ligand backbone with two different metal centers&#8208;Co2+ and Zn2+. This study emphasizes a significant method for examining metal&#8208;ligand interactions at the single&#8208;molecule scale, for both spin and non&#8208;spin systems. The findings could have implications for our understanding of electron transport in systems with metal atoms.







Abstract
Investigating the correlation between metal coordination and molecular conductivity in single&#8208;molecule systems is essential for advancing our knowledge of molecular electronics, particularly in the realm of spintronics. In the present study, we developed two complex wires utilizing the bipyridine ligand and two transition metal ions, Co2+ and Zn2+, aiming to study the impact of different spin characters on single&#8208;molecule charge transport properties. Single&#8208;molecule conductance was investigated using scanning tunnelling microscope breaking junctions (STM&#8208;BJ) technique and the underlying mechanism was analysed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We demonstrated that the conductance predominantly increases after inserting Zn2+, indicating a conducting channel has been constructed. In contrast, the conductance of the analogue coordinated with Co2+ does not change significantly, this can be explained by distinct disparities between spin&#8208;up and spin&#8208;down channels, in which destructive quantum interference in spin&#8208;down state counteracts the enhancement of molecular conductance. Our study establishes the groundwork for a systematic approach to the design, fabrication, and implementation of single&#8208;complex conductance explorations.

This work firstly disclosed that indoline&#8208;derived azadienes could serve as 1&#8208;atom synthons, providing a straightforward protocol for indoline&#8208;spiro&#8208;hexahydropyrimidines via an innovative formal [1+5] cyclization between indoline&#8208;derived azadienes and 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes.







Abstract
An unprecedented formal [1+5] cyclization of indoline&#8208;derived azadienes with 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes has been realized, providing a facile access to biologically important indoline&#8208;spiro&#8208;hexahydropyrimidines with good to excellent yields (up to 99&#8201;% yield). Different from previous reports, this is the first study that indoline&#8208;derived azadienes could participate in cyclizations as one&#8208;atom synthons. This methodology is also distinguished by not involving any additive or catalyst, readily available starting materials, wide range of substrate applicability, operational simplicity and simultaneously reassembling two C&#8722;N and two C&#8722;C bonds in one&#8208;step reaction.

         <title>Theoretical Study on Binary Monolayer P3S&#8208;I for Photocatalytic Overall Water Plitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 15, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
P3S&#8722;I monolayer possesses suitable bandgap, appropriate band edge positions, high carrier mobility and large optical absorption coefficients. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) can react simultaneously at the P and S atoms, respectively, triggered merely by the photogenerated electrons and holes.







Abstract
The utilization of visible light to split water into H&#8322; and O&#8322; offers a promising solution to address the escalating global energy crisis and environmental pollution. Compared to conventional three&#8208;dimensional (3D) photocatalysts, anisotropic two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials exhibit enhanced photocatalytic activity due to their ultrahigh surface area, reduced charge migration distance, and improved efficiency. In this study, we employ a swarm&#8208;intelligence search combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations to propose a novel series of stable 2D phosphorus sulfides, PxSy (x, y=1&#8211;6), as promising candidates for photocatalytic water splitting. The P3S&#8722;I monolayer exhibits an optimal bandgap (2.485&#8197;eV), appropriate band edge positions (&#8722;3.52&#8197;eV for CBM and &#8722;6.00&#8197;eV for VBM at the HSE06 level), high carrier mobility (3246.85&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 for &#956;e along the y&#8208;direction and 1039.80&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 for &#956;h along the x&#8208;direction), and strong optical absorption coefficients (exceeding 1&#215;10&#8309;&#8197;cm&#8722;1 within the visible spectrum). Notably, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are facilitated concurrently at the P and S sites, respectively, driven exclusively by photogenerated electrons and holes. The P3S&#8722;I monolayer achieves a high photocatalytic water&#8208;splitting efficiency of 17.7&#8201;% in both acidic and neutral environments. These findings provide theoretical insights into the design of efficient 2D materials for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven overall water splitting.

Dual&#8208;functional peptides exhibiting both anti&#8208;amyloid and antimicrobial activities have attracted attention as promising candidates for Alzheimer's disease treatment. The advantage of these peptides lies in their ability to simultaneously target both the amyloid cascade hypothesis and the microbial infection hypothesis, in contrast to single&#8208;function inhibitors. However, most of the reported dual&#8208;functional peptides to date are natural peptides, and the development of synthetic peptides in this area remains limited. In this study, we propose two strategies to aid in the discovery of synthetic dual&#8208;functional peptides. We then report four distinct synthetic dual&#8208;functional peptides identified using these strategies, with the A&#946;1&#8211;40/A&#946;1&#8211;42 fibrillation system and common bacterial strains serving as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept platform. One strategy involves repurposing existing knowledge, while the other breaks from established conventions. Using the first strategy, we discovered a very short dual&#8208;functional linear peptide. With the second strategy, we identified a simple dual&#8208;functional cyclic peptide. Furthermore, by combining these two strategies, we developed a hybrid dual&#8208;functional peptide incorporating both linear and cyclic structures. We hope that our findings will contribute to the future discovery of more synthetic dual&#8208;functional peptides for treating Alzheimer's disease.

A straightforward synthesis of homotrimetallic Co polypnictogen cage complexes of the type [(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)3(&#956;3,&#951;2:&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;E3)(&#956;3&#8208;E)] (E=P (3), As (4)) is presented. These clusters were elucidated in terms of their redox chemistry by cyclic voltammetry. Stepwise reduction and oxidation over four stages give access to the corresponding salts containing monoanions, monocations and dications, which were comprehensively characterized in solution and in the solid state, respectively.

Both complexes show a distinct redox chemistry, which was first investigated by cyclic voltammetry. Subsequently, the monoanions [K(L)(sol)n][(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)3(&#956;3,&#951;2:&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;E3)(&#956;3&#8208;E)] (E=P, L=18cr6, sol=dme, n=2 (5), E=As, L=2,2,2&#8208;crypt, n=0 (6)), the monocations [(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)3(&#956;3,&#951;2:&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;E3)(&#956;3&#8208;E)][FAl] (E=P (7), As (8)) and the dications [(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)3(&#956;3,&#951;3:&#951;3:&#951;3&#8208;E4)][TEF]2 (E=P (9), As (10)) could be realized experimentally and isolated in moderate to good yields. All compounds were characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis, NMR and EPR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and elemental analysis.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed 1,4&#8208;Dichloromethyldimerization of Alkenes with Chloroform: Access to Polychlorinated Vicinal Diaryl Alkanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 15, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated strategy for directly synthesizing polychlorinated vicinal diaryl alkanes from aryl alkenes and chloroform is reported. Besides chloroform, this method also works with carbon tetrachloride, bromotrichloromethane, and &#945;&#8208;bromo carboxylic esters, yielding 1,4&#8208;disubstituted vicinal diaryl alkanes. The approach uses simple, accessible materials, offering high selectivity, broad substrate scope, and mild conditions.







Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated strategy is reported for the direct synthesis of polychlorinated vicinal diaryl alkanes from aryl alkenes and chloroform. In this approach, two haloalkyl radicals generated from chloroform via halogen atom transfer (XAT) and direct single electron transfer (SET) within the same photoredox catalysis cycle enable the 1,4&#8208;dichloromethyldimerization of alkenes. Besides chloroform, this strategy is applicable to carbon tetrachloride, bromotrichloromethane, and &#945;&#8208;bromo carboxylic esters, yielding corresponding 1,4&#8208;disubstituted vicinal diaryl alkanes. Diverse polychlorinated structures containing highly congested vicinal quaternary carbon centers are effectively synthesized by this method. The potential of this reaction in late&#8208;stage drug modification is highlighted by the successful transformation of olefins with pharmaceutical structures.

         <title>Impact of Structural Subtleties on Chirality Induction and Amplification in Trizinc(II)Porphyrin Trimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 15, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A subtle modification in a &#8216;nano&#8208;size&#8217; trizinc(II) porphyrin trimer profoundly affects its complexation and chirogenic responses with chiral diamine substrates: while &#8216;open&#8217; form generates &#8216;monomeric&#8217; complex with low CD amplitude, &#8216;closed&#8217; form produces exclusive &#8216;polymer&#8217; with large, amplified CD signal with opposite sign.







Abstract
Herein, we report the precise control of molecular to supramolecular chirality induction at the single&#8208;molecule level just upon subtle modification in an achiral &#8216;nano&#8208;size&#8217; trizinc(II) porphyrin trimer. A slight variation in the projection of the substituent at the periphery of the central porphyrin unit in a porphyrin trimer (host) resulted in pronounced changes in the interchromophoric arrangement, leading to distinct &#8216;open&#8217; and &#8216;closed&#8217; conformations. While &#8216;open&#8217; form generates &#8216;monomeric&#8217; complex with low CD amplitude, &#8216;closed&#8217; form produces exclusive &#8216;polymer&#8217; with large, amplified CD signal with opposite sign due to stronger intermolecular excitonic coupling. Also, the sign of the CD couplets is just opposite between R and S substrates for both polymer and monomer which suggest that the chirality is predominantly governed by the stereogenic projection of the chiral center. X&#8208;ray structures of the host and polymer have been reported here. Crystallographic characterization offers a detailed perspective on the structural and geometrical transformations in the polymer, enabling a systematic understanding of its optical properties. DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations strongly corroborate with the experimental findings.

We have developed an efficient synthesis of fluoroalkenes via tandem electrochemical dehalogenation&#8208;elimination protocol. The key step is the generation of carbon anion by electrochemical reductive dehalogenation of alkyl halides. Various gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes and monofluoroalkenes were prepared in moderate to good yields from &#945;&#8208;difluoromethylated/&#945;&#8208;trifluoro methylated benzyl halides.

         <title>Exploring the Metal&#8208;Centered Reactivity of Isomeric, N&#8208;Bridged Biscyclometalated Platinum(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 15, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidation of new N&#8208;bridged bis(phenylpyridine)platinum(II) complexes is explored, uncovering the chemical and photophysical properties of Pt(IV) monomers and Pt(III) dimers. The mystery of the Pt(III) dimers is unraveled, implicating the bulky phenylenes on the bridging nitrogen and the isomeric binding pockets as co&#8208;factors in destabilizing the rare intermetallic Pt&#8211;Pt bond.







Abstract
The field of platinum chemistry is ubiquitous in the research of anticancer drugs and new OLED materials. Within the vast library of existing compounds, the majority of work focuses on complexes in the +2 and +4 oxidation states, with comparatively few examples of PtIII complexes reported without bridging ligands. PtIII complexes with metal&#8208;metal bonding can be made by mild oxidation of PtII complexes having bis(phenylpyridine) ligands. Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of two new PtII complexes bearing tetradentate N&#8208;bridged bis(phenylpyridine) ligands with N^C*C^N and C^N*N^C coordinating atoms. Through chemical oxidation with PhICl2 and N&#8208;chlorosuccinimide, we obtained four new complexes containing PtIV and PtIII centres. The dynamics of the PtIII&#160;complexes were explored by variable&#8208;temperature NMR studies and showed surprisingly free rotation of the appended N&#8208;aryl group. This work uncovers the importance of the destabilizing nature of the bulky N&#8208;aryl group on intermetallic bonds, and sheds light on how the molecular rotation observed in the PtIII compounds could inspire new molecular rotors driven by intermetallic bonds.

Abstract
The systematic nucleophilic functionalization of the cationic pentaphosphole ligand complex [Cp*Fe(&#951;4&#8208;P5Me)][OTf] (A) with group 16/17 nucleophiles is reported. This method represents a highly reliable and versatile strategy for the design of novel transition&#8208;metal complexes featuring twofold substituted end&#8208;deck cyclo&#8208;P5 ligands, bearing unprecedented hetero&#8208;element substituents. By the reaction of A with classical group 16 nucleophiles, complexes of the type [Cp*Fe(&#951;4&#8208;P5MeE)] (E=OEt (1), OtBu (2), SPh (3), SePh (4)) are obtained. By transferring this protocol to group 17 nucleophiles, the highly sensitive complexes [Cp*FeP5(&#951;4&#8208;P5MeX)] (X=F (5), Cl (6), Br (7), I (8)) could be isolated. All products show exclusively 1,1'&#8208;substitution at the cyclo&#8208;P5 ring. Interestingly, further studies on the reactivity of the halogenated species revealed their ability to undergo ring&#8208;opening reactions with cyclic ethers such as THF and ethylene oxide yielding [Cp*FeP5(&#951;4&#8208;P5MeOC4H8X)] (X=Br (9), I (10)) or [Cp*FeP5(&#951;4&#8208;P5MeOC2H4X)] (X=Br (11), I (12)), respectively. Furthermore, the use of acyclic ethers such as dimethoxyethane led to the formation of [Cp*FeP5(&#951;4&#8208;P5MeOC2H4OCH3)] (13) mediated by C&#8722;O bond cleavage, followed by subsequent P&#8722;O bond formation, as further enlightened by DFT calculations.

A head&#8208;to&#8208;tail monomer consisting of cleft&#8208;shaped bisporphyrin and trinitrofluorenone units connected by a chiral binaphthyl linker forms one&#8208;handed helical supramolecular polymers in solution and on a substrate induced by the R and S configurations of the binaphthyl linker. The cover artwork illustrates a helically twisted supramolecular polymer of head&#8208;to&#8208;tail bisporphyrin monomers on a substrate. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Haino and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202404210).

The synthesis of a stable diradical compound with two ligand radicals that are very weakly antiferromagnetically coupled was mediated by a closed&#8208;shell metal centre. The minimal interaction between the two electrons allows them to retain their independence&#8212;a rare and intriguing characteristic under ambient conditions. The metaphor of two rivers with distinct, immiscible characteristics meeting and flowing side by side without merging beautifully illustrates the idea that not all similar entities spontaneously amalgamate, as observed in the ligand radicals which defy typical spin&#8208;quenching behaviour despite being in close proximity and remain distinct under normal conditions.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The synthesis of a stable diradical&lt;/b&gt; compound with two ligand radicals that are very weakly antiferromagnetically coupled was mediated by a closed-shell metal centre. The minimal interaction between the two electrons allows them to retain their independence&#8212;a rare and intriguing characteristic under ambient conditions. The metaphor of two rivers with distinct, immiscible characteristics meeting and flowing side by side without merging beautifully illustrates the idea that not all similar entities spontaneously amalgamate, as observed in the ligand radicals which defy typical spin-quenching behaviour despite being in close proximity and remain distinct under normal conditions.

Dancing with light: A chemo&#8208;optogenetic system has been developed by using azobenzene&#8208;based photoswitchable molecular glues (sMGs) to reversibly control protein dimerization/proximity in living cells. Under blue light, these molecules bring two proteins together, whereas green light causes them to separate, like a dance. This system provides a new tool for studying complex cell processes with high precision in both time and space. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y.&#8197;W. Wuand co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202403808).

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing Elastomers and Coatings via Metal Coordination Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 15, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarized the self&#8208;healing performance and mechanical properties of elastomers and coatings based on coordination bonds. Metal&#8208;ligand coordination structures can form metal ion clusters or induce microphase separation in polymer matrix, which can effectively dissipate mechanical energy and endowing the material with self&#8208;healing capabilities.







Abstract
Self&#8208;healing materials can recover the materials from physical damage, and extend the life of equipment. Metal coordination bonds are supramolecular interactions with tunable stability and sensitivity to external stimuli, which are crucial for developing self&#8208;healing materials. Incorporating metal coordination bonds into elastomers and coatings can enable materials to repair damage and enhance material performance. This review details the advance in self&#8208;healing elastomers and coatings. The structural characteristics, mechanical properties, and self&#8208;healing efficacy of these materials are discussed, and a perspective on the challenges and development directions is given.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 15, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#932;his Review presents a comprehensive overview of the very recent developments on COF&#8208;based photocatalysts for H2O2 evolution. First, neat COFs with variable architecture are critically explored, followed by the presentation of the most promising hybrid COF&#8208;based heterojunctions. Several structure&#8208;activity aspects affecting the photocatalytic performance of these materials is thoroughly discussed.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are considered advanced class materials due to their exotic structural and optical properties. The abundance of starting monomers with variable linkage motifs may give rise to multiple conformations in either 2D or 3D fashion. Tailoring of the abovementioned properties has facilitated the application of COFs in a wide range of applications, which are strongly correlated with energy conversion schemes. Having a crystalline porous character and a large set of donor&#8208;acceptor combinations, COFs are expected to make huge impact in photocatalytic processes. In this Review, we present the recent advances in the development of semiconducting COF&#8208;based systems towards the photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide evolution. An overview is given about the effect of various parameters on the photocatalytic performance, such as charge transfer tuning, wettability by chemical functionalization, topology, porosity and crystallinity. Various challenges are discussed, and constructive insights are given for the development of highly functional COF&#8208;based photocatalysts for H2O2 evolution.

         <title>Recent Progress in Atomically Precise Cu&#8722;M Alloy Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 15, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review encapsulates recent progress in efficient synthetic methodologies and structural elucidation techniques tailored for Cu&#8722;M alloy nanoclusters. It underscores the intrinsic physical and chemical properties that enable precise control over their sizes and surface characteristics. Illustrative instances of Cu&#8722;M alloy nanoclusters are leveraged to showcase their photoluminescent and catalytic traits, shedding light on their multifaceted functionalities and prospective applications.







Abstract
Metal nanoclusters (NCs) with dimensions of approximately 3&#8197;nm serve as a crucial link between metal&#8208;organic complexes and metal nanoparticles, garnering significant interest due to their distinctive molecule&#8208;like characteristics. These include well&#8208;defined molecular structures, clear HOMO&#8211;LUMO transitions, quantized charge, and robust luminescence emission. Atomically precise alloy NCs, in contrast to homometallic NCs, exhibit a wealth of structures and intriguing properties, with their novel attributes often intricately tied to the positions of alloyed elements within the structure, facilitating the exploration of structure&#8208;property relationships. A notable subgroup within this category comprises Cu&#8722;M (where M represents metals such as Au, Ag, Rh, Ir, Pd, Pt, Zn, Al etc.) alloy NCs. In this review, we initially outline recent advancements in the development of efficient synthetic techniques for Cu&#8722;M alloy NCs, emphasizing the underlying physical and chemical properties that enable precise control over their sizes and surface characteristics. Subsequently, we delve into recent progress in structural elucidation techniques for Cu&#8722;M alloy NCs. This structural insight is instrumental in comprehensively understanding the structure&#8208;property correlations at the molecular level. Finally, we showcase various examples of Cu&#8722;M alloy NCs to illustrate their photoluminescent and catalytic properties, shedding light on their diverse functionalities and potential applications.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 15, March 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pillararenes has emerged as versatile and efficient tools for molecular recognition and assembly. Moreover, the design and synthesis of novel macrocycles with distinctive structures and properties can unleash new opportunities for supramolecular chemistry. This review highlights recent advances in novel pillararene&#8208;inspired water&#8208;soluble macrocyclic hosts including their molecular recognition and applications in functional material, catalysis and biomedicine.







Abstract
Pillararenes and their derivatives have emerged in supramolecular chemistry as unique macrocycles for applications in host&#8211;guest chemistry, materials science and biomimetics. Many variations have been conceived and synthesized in recent years and in this review, we relate progress in water&#8208;soluble versions: leaning towerarenes, extended&#8208;pillararenes, biphenarenes, helicarenes and octopusarenes. These are applied in targeted drug delivery, selective uptake and release of aromatic guests, fabrication of gold/silver and mesoporous silica nanoparticles, cell imaging, pollutant separation, biomedicine (e.&#8201;g. biofilm disruptors, taste masking containers, neuromuscular blockers, antidotes for macromolecular biotoxin) and enantioselective recognition. It is intended that this review will be helpful for research in synthetic macrocyclic chemistry and supramolecular functional systems, leading to practical applications in various research areas.

&lt;p&gt;Pillararenes and their derivatives have emerged in supramolecular chemistry as unique macrocycles for applications in host&#8211;guest chemistry, materials science and biomimetics. Many variations have been conceived and synthesized in recent years and in this review, we relate progress in water-soluble versions: leaning towerarenes, extended-pillararenes, biphenarenes, helicarenes and octopusarenes. These are applied in targeted drug delivery, selective uptake and release of aromatic guests, fabrication of gold/silver and mesoporous silica nanoparticles, cell imaging, pollutant separation, biomedicine (e.&#8201;g. biofilm disruptors, taste masking containers, neuromuscular blockers, antidotes for macromolecular biotoxin) and enantioselective recognition. It is intended that this review will be helpful for research in synthetic macrocyclic chemistry and supramolecular functional systems, leading to practical applications in various research areas.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tunable Photoluminescence of LiTaO3: Tb3+, Sm3+ For Dynamic Multimode Optical Anti&#8208;counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Currently, static fluorescent anti&#8208;counterfeiting technology struggles to cope with the increasingly sophisticated counterfeiting techniques, making the dynamic multimode regulation scheme an urgent necessity. Herein,&#160;&#160;Sm3+ mono&#8208;/co&#8208;doped LiTaO3 (LTO) phosphors are prepared by high temperature solid state method. Under 254 nm excitation, the emission chromaticity of LTO: Tb3+, Sm3+ is modulated from green to yellow by increasing Sm3+ content due to Tb3+ &#8594; Sm3+ energy transfer. The diverging luminescence thermal stability of LTO: Tb3+ and LTO: Sm3+ is uncovered, which is governed by their distinct vacuum&#8208;referenced binding energy (VRBE) levels and charge compensation mechanisms. Based on the time&#8208;domain difference between the trap&#8208;assisted afterglow of Tb3+ and the photoluminescence of Sm3+, a dynamic anti&#8208;counterfeiting pattern that changes from green to orange over time is designed. This work provides a novel material design strategy for time&#8208;resolved color signatures and multi&#8208;modal dynamic optical encryption.</dc:description>

         <title>Applications of COFs in Photocatalysis for Energy Production and Harmful Substance Degradation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic technology has attracted considerable attention in recent years due to its significant potential in environmental protection and energy conversion. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), a novel class of porous materials, demonstrate remarkable photocatalytic performance owing to their high surface areas, tunable pore sizes, permanent porosities, and customizable functionalities. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the application of COFs in photocatalysis. In energy&#8208;related applications, COFs effectively catalyze hydrogen (H2) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation, and uranium (U(VI)) extraction from seawater, thereby offering new avenues for sustainable energy generation. In environmental remediation, COFs exploit photocatalytic properties to reduce CO2 emissions and degrade antibiotics in wastewater, thereby contributing to greenhouse gas mitigation and the enhancement of water quality. The review further explores the underlying mechanisms of COFs in photocatalytic H2 and H2O2 generation, U(VI) reduction, CO2 reduction, and antibiotic degradation, emphasizing the synergy between COF structure and photocatalytic performance. Nevertheless, challenges persist concerning the stability, catalytic efficiency, and scalability of COFs. Future research should prioritize optimizing synthesis methods, tuning structural features, and enhancing the stability and performance of COFs to facilitate their practical applications. These advancements are crucial for promoting the widespread adoption of photocatalytic technologies in the energy and environmental sectors.</dc:description>

         <title>The Synthesis of Hydroquinolines from Nitroaldehydes and Ketones by Hydrogenation Sequences and Condensations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic reaction discovery or methodology development is preferably performed with homogeneous catalysts, but heterogeneous catalysts allow the design of complex multistep syntheses based on their reusability. We introduce here the catalytic synthesis of hydroquinolines starting from nitroaldehydes, ketones and hydrogen. The reaction is complex and proceeds via multiple selective hydrogenation and condensation steps. The nitroaldehyde is selectively hydrogenated forming an aminoaldehyde, followed by a base&#8208;catalyzed Friedl&#228;nder synthesis and selective quinoline hydrogenation. The starting materials are inexpensive, simple regarding their structure and diversely available, and the hydroquinoline motif is part of numerous biologically active compounds. A nanostructured earth&#8208;abundant metal catalyst mediates our reaction most efficiently.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of the Membrane Spanning Tetraether Lipid brGDGT Ia and Elucidation of its Stereochemical Configuration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) are a group of membrane spanning lipids produced by both Archaea and Bacteria. Branched GDGTs (brGDGTs) are a class of these tetraether lipids known to be produced by certain bacteria and are commonly found in terrestrial environments. Due to their environmental ubiquity, high preservation potential, and role in membrane adaptation, brGDGTs form the basis of many widely employed paleoenvironmental proxies. The tetramethylated brGDGT Ia is the most commonly reported branched tetraether in cultured Acidobacteria and is a key component of brGDGT&#8208;based temperature indices. Herein, we report the first total synthesis of brGDGT Ia, thereby elucidating the relative configuration of the methyl branches as syn. We further demonstrate that VCD spectroscopy is a suitable tool to determine the absolute configuration of these cryptochiral compounds, a method waiting to be applied to the natural lipid, but currently hampered by its limited availability.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanically Robust and Recyclable Polyurea Networks Enabled by Dynamic Caprolactam&#8208;Urea Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The integration of dynamic covalent bonds into polymer design offers transformative potential for sustainable materials.&#160;&#160;Herein, we report a catalyst&#8208;free dynamic caprolactam&#8208;urea (CAU) bond that enables the construction of poly(caprolactam&#8208;ureas) (PCAU) networks with dual mechanical and chemical recyclability. The resulting PCAU networks exhibit remarkable mechanical robustness, solvent resistance, and hydrolytic stability. Owing to the rapid dynamic exchange of CAU bonds, PCAU networks are successfully mechanically recycled via hot&#8208;pressing over multiple cycles with &gt;92% mechanical property retention. Furthermore, chemical recycling is achieved through selective depolymerization into caprolactam monomers under mild catalyst&#8208;free conditions, which are directly repolymerized into new generations of PCAU networks. This work establishes CAU chemistry as a versatile platform for designing high&#8208;performance dynamic polymers with applications in circular manufacturing.</dc:description>

         <title>Atmospheric Ignition Chemistry of Green Hypergolic Bipropellant 1&#8208;Ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;Methylimidazolium Cyanoborohydride &#8211; Hydrogen Peroxide in an Acoustic Levitator: Exploring a Potent Universal Propellant</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hypergolic ionic liquids (HILs) represent a critical pool of reactive ionic liquids which ignite spontaneously in absence of oxygen when mixed with an oxidizer such as white fuming nitric acid (WFNA, HNO3) or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). These HILs have emerged as greener alternative to the toxic hydrazine family of fuels for operations in space under anaerobic conditions. Here, we report on the unusual atmospheric ignition chemistry of the 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium cyanoborohydride ([EMIM][CBH])&#8208;H2O2 bipropellant while comparing with the parent hypergolic reaction by exploiting a chirped&#8208;pulse triggered droplet merging technique in an ultrasonic levitation apparatus under controlled environment. Significant enhancements of the ignition performance and noticeable differences of product distribution in the simulated atmosphere containing molecular oxygen are revealed. The critical mechanistic role of the surrounding oxygen plausibly involves the reaction with a suitable intermediate (iminomethyl)boronic acid, [(HO)2BCH=NH] formed in the initial reactions of the IL and H2O2 which eventually generates catalytic hydroperoxyl (&#8226;HO2) and hydroxyl (&#8226;OH) radicals &#8208; further promoting the ignition reaction. This systematic case study conceptually demonstrates that under atmospheric conditions, well&#8208;defined HIL &#8208; oxidizer combinations provide excellent ignition performance and effectively be used as universal fuel both in space and in the terrestrial atmosphere simplifying the multistage propulsion system.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomimetic Growth of Calcium Oxalate Hydrates:

Shape Development and Structures in Agar Gel Matrices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystal growth of calcium oxalate hydrates (COM: calcium oxalate monohydrate; COD: &#8208;dihydrate; COT: &#8208;trihydrate) is a specific example of biomineralization due to their harmful role as kidney/urinary stones. In this work, the biomimetic growth of calcium oxalate hydrates has been achieved using double diffusion technique in agar gel matrix. In&#8208;vitro experimental models for the growth of calcium oxalates can give valuable information on the formation of kidney/urinary stones. Diverse morphological forms of COM are grown in agar gel matrices ranging from platy crystallites to dumbbells and spherulites. The morphology of COM grown in agar gel resembles biogenic COM stones remarkably. Furthermore, it has been discovered that a higher pH of the agar gel promotes COD development while suppressing COM growth.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Phosphate and sulfate groups play an important role in controlling the physical properties of biomolecules and artificial materials. However, despite their significance, the incorporation of phosphate or sulfate groups into aqueous organic compounds using non&#8208;enzymatic methods has been unprecedented.

         <title>Highly Efficient Separation of Toluene and n&#8208;heptane by Amorphous Cucurbit[7]uril Solids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Separating toluene from n&#8208;heptane is a challenging task in the petroleum industry. Traditional methods face problems including elevated energy usage, intricate technical procedures, and residual extractants. Herein, we developed an environmentally friendly, low energy consuming and economically efficient adsorption separation method. This study employed cucurbit[7]uril (Q[7]) as an adsorbent to efficiently separate toluene from a mixture of toluene and n&#8208;heptane. The purity of toluene was obtained to be 99.38% from the mixed vapors and 99.65% from the mixed liquids. The kinetic experiment results demonstrate that the adsorption behavior of toluene was chemisorption. Density functional theory calculations show that the structure of toluene@Q[7] is more stable. In addition, vacuum heating can remove toluene from the Q[7] cavity, resulting in a guest&#8208;free Q[7], which can be repeated for the adsorption separation process without loss of performance. This study has the potential value of addressing the pressing need for efficient resource utilization in light of diminishing petroleum supplies.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Glycerol Oxidation Toward Dihydroxyacetone Over Gold/Palladium Binary Nanocatalysts by Structure Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold/palladium binary catalysts have been widely used to the selective oxidation of glycerol to produce value&#8208;added chemicals. However, the essential effect of the structure of Au/Pd binary catalysts on the catalytic performance has not been elucidated yet. In this work, Au, Pd, AuPd alloy, Au@Pd core&#8208;shell, and Au&#8208;Pd Janus nanoparticle catalysts prepared by sol&#8208;immobilization and photochemical deposition methods were employed to the selective oxidation of glycerol toward dihydroxyacetone (DHA). The results showed that&#160;the activation of glycerol and oxygen molecule was significantly promoted with the appropriate interaction between Au and Pd atoms.&#160;That was, the turnover frequency of glycerol and DHA generation rate over the alloyed AuPd nanoparticles were remarkably&#160;higher than those of Au@Pd core&#8208;shell and Au&#8208;Pd Janus nanoparticle catalysts. It was due to the&#160; synergistic effect&#160;of Pd and Au atoms&#160;remarkably promoted the electron transfer from Pd to Au,&#160;resulting in increasing the activity of the exposed Au sites, and moderately inhibiting the activity of the exposed Pd sites, which benefited to generate DHA rapidly.&#160;After optimizing, up to 61% yield of DHA was achieved at 87% glycerol conversion over the alloyed AuPd catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Shelf&#8208;Stable 3&#8208;Thiocresyl&#8208;Prop&#8208;1&#8208;Enyl (TCP) Glycosides in Oligosaccharide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study establishes a glycosylation method using a shelf&#8208;stable 3&#8208;thiocresyl&#8208;prop&#8208;1&#8208;enyl (TCP) glycosides. The synthesis involves modifying an allyl glycoside with a thiocresyl moiety to secure TCP glycoside, which, upon activation with NIS&#8208;AgOTf, affords desired glycoside in good to excellent yields. TCP glycoside donors offer advantages of remarkable shelf&#8208;stability, compatibility with various protecting groups and access to both 1,2&#8208;cis and 1,2&#8208;trans glycosides.







Abstract
Transformation of the allyl glycosides to a glycosylation&#8208;active 3&#8208;thiocresyl&#8208;prop&#8208;1&#8208;enyl (TCP) glycosides is reported herein, in an effort to devise a shelf&#8208;stable, active vinyl glycoside. Remote electrophilic activation with an iodonium source results in the formation of a glycosylation&#8208;active moiety. The efficiency of the TCP glycoside donor is demonstrated through the synthesis of a panel of di&#8208; and trisaccharides of pyranosides and furanosides, including globo&#8208;trioside Gb3 antigen, wherein a disarmed TCP glycoside is converted facile to an armed TCP glycosyl donor, further ascertaining the tolerance towards protecting group manipulations. In addition, the synthetic utility of the TCP glycoside donor is demonstrated through the syntheses of biologically relevant tri&#8208; and hexasaccharide oligomannans, thereby establishing the potential of this new TCP glycosyl donor for oligosaccharide synthesis.

     alt="Shelf-Stable 3-Thiocresyl-Prop-1-Enyl (TCP) Glycosides in Oligosaccharide Synthesis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study establishes a glycosylation method using a shelf-stable 3-thiocresyl-prop-1-enyl (TCP) glycosides. The synthesis involves modifying an allyl glycoside with a thiocresyl moiety to secure TCP glycoside, which, upon activation with NIS-AgOTf, affords desired glycoside in good to excellent yields. TCP glycoside donors offer advantages of remarkable shelf-stability, compatibility with various protecting groups and access to both 1,2-cis and 1,2-trans glycosides.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transformation of the allyl glycosides to a glycosylation-active 3-thiocresyl-prop-1-enyl (TCP) glycosides is reported herein, in an effort to devise a shelf-stable, active vinyl glycoside. Remote electrophilic activation with an iodonium source results in the formation of a glycosylation-active moiety. The efficiency of the TCP glycoside donor is demonstrated through the synthesis of a panel of di- and trisaccharides of pyranosides and furanosides, including globo-trioside Gb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; antigen, wherein a disarmed TCP glycoside is converted facile to an armed TCP glycosyl donor, further ascertaining the tolerance towards protecting group manipulations. In addition, the synthetic utility of the TCP glycoside donor is demonstrated through the syntheses of biologically relevant tri- and hexasaccharide oligomannans, thereby establishing the potential of this new TCP glycosyl donor for oligosaccharide synthesis. Mechanistic studies reveal the remote activation of the thioether moiety by promoters, as evidenced through identification of the thioether and acrolein by-products arising from the reaction. Further, the applicability of TCP glycosides as glycosyl acceptors is also verified in glycosylations involving glycosyl halide donors. The facile isomerization of allyl glycoside, remarkable shelf-stability, tolerance towards protecting groups and applicability as a glycosyl donor, as well as glycosyl acceptor offer key advantages to TCP glycosides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlled Pyrolysis of Bromine&#8208;Modulated Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Solvent&#8208;Free and Co&#8208;Catalyst&#8208;Free Cycloaddition of CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a controlled pyrolysis strategy to develop a metal&#8208;organic framework&#8208;derived catalyst that innovatively incorporates unsaturated Zn and C&#8722;Br bond as acid and base sites, respectively. The catalyst exhibits superior activity and selectivity with &gt;99&#8201;% propylene carbonates yield for the co&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free and solvent&#8208;free CO2 cycloaddition with propylene oxide under mild conditions.







Abstract
The cycloaddition of CO&#8322; with epoxides to synthesize cyclic carbonates is a crucial but challenging process. In particular, the co&#8208;catalyst required for higher yields in this reaction inevitably dissolves in organic solvents, resulting in product impurities and solvent&#8208;related hazards. Therefore, a heterogeneous catalyst that delivers high yields under solvent&#8208;free and co&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free conditions is highly desirable. In this study, we propose a controlled pyrolysis strategy to develop a metal&#8208;organic framework&#8208;derived catalyst that innovatively incorporates bromine via a C&#8722;Br bond. EXAFS, FT&#8208;IR and XPS analyses reveal the co&#8208;presence of unsaturated Zn sites and C&#8722;Br bonds, which act as acid and base sites, respectively. The synergy between these sites prevents bromine leakage and facilitates the ring&#8208;opening of epoxides, thereby overcoming the barriers in the cycloaddition reaction. As a result, this catalyst achieves superior catalytic performance with over 99&#8201;% yield of propylene carbonates under solvent&#8208;free and co&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free conditions. The resulting propylene carbonate can be used directly as an electrolyte in battery applications without further purification. This work provides valuable insights into the modular design of heterogeneous catalysts for solvent&#8208;free and co&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free CO&#8322; cycloaddition reactions.

         <title>Cooperative Photoredox Catalysis Under Confinement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Concept article provides an overview of advancements in confinement&#8208;aided photoredox catalysis, spanning across well&#8208;established heterogeneous frameworks to emerging homogeneous single&#8208;chain polymers. Focus is placed upon design elements that enable spatial proximity of cocatalysts which, in turn, provides optimal electron, energy, and/or radical transfers. Collectively, the architectures discussed herein underscore the importance of confinement in tackling diffusion limitations in catalysis.







Abstract
Photoredox catalysis has emerged as a potent means to conduct synthetic chemistry. Leveraging light to achieve challenging organic transformations has led to many developments, both of fundamental and industrial nature. Despite their potency, photoredox processes are inherently diffusion controlled, which can limit their ability to enable both reactivity and selectivity. Relevant to this is the idea of colocalizing cocatalysts in architectures that enable spatial proximity, promoting &#8216;catalysis under confinement.&#8217; In this Concept review, we summarize recent designs and advancements using well&#8208;defined heterogeneous and homogeneous frameworks that enable dual photoredox catalysis, such as metal&#8208;organic frameworks, heterogeneous organic polymeric systems, and single&#8208;chain polymer nanoparticles (SCNPs). These advances generally stem from the material's inherent ability to enforce catalyst communication, typically resulting in expedient radical, electron, or energy transfer that accelerates reactivity. Whereas heterogeneous systems are comprehensively investigated, the design space arising from the modularity and versatility of a SCNP is quite large making the recyclable platform an intriguing candidate to investigate for confinement&#8208;enabled photoredox catalysis. We expect that both heterogeneous and homogeneous platforms systems detailed herein will continue to exhibit superior performance, while underscoring the importance of confinement to tackle diffusion&#8208;limited reactions.

         <title>Synthesis of Derivatives of the Antibiotic Albicidin: The N&#8208;Terminal Fragment as Key to Control Potency and Resistance Mediated by the Binding Protein AlbA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This manuscript gives a deep inside in the structure&#8208;activity relationship of the N&#8208;terminal fragment of the antibiotic albicidin. This study uncovered a new structure scaffold comprising bicyclic aromatics as replacement for albicidin's methyl coumaric acid. Such variations enable the control of the resistance factor AlbA while maintaining excellent antibacterial activity.







Abstract
The peptide albicidin represents a highly promising lead structure which is a first&#8208;in&#8208;class antibiotic with remarkable potency against gram&#8208;negative bacteria. Past efforts in the synthesis of albicidin analogs focused on increasing hydrophilicity, broadening of the antibacterial profile and overcoming resistance. Herein, we present synthetic albicidin derivatives with variations in the N&#8208;terminal building block and characterize their antibacterial activity and DNA gyrase inhibition. Furthermore, we show that the N&#8208;terminus of albicidin greatly affects binding to the resistance factor AlbAL. This transcription regulator senses albicidin and triggers the biosynthesis of the binding protein AlbAS, thus reducing the free concentration of the antibiotic. Here we demonstrate uncoupling of the binding event from transcription activation for some derivatives, and even a few derivatives seemed insensitive to sequestration by AlbA. This approach could be a strategy to develop albicidin analogs escaping AlbA resistance.

         <title>Isolation and Characterization of [MnFe(CO)10]+: The Missing Link in the 3&#8201;d Dimetal Decacarbonyl Series</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent or Lewis&#8208;Pair? The combination of the metalloradical [Fe(CO)5]+&#8901; and Mn2(CO)10 yields the first heterodinuclear transition metal cation [MnFe(CO)10]+. With equally distributed charges, it makes the complex cation a borderline case between the covalent 2x17&#8197;VE and the Lewis&#8208;pair 16+18 VE electron counts. Hence, a case for grayscale opposing black and white settings.







Abstract
The heterodinuclear dimetal decacarbonyl cation [MnFe(CO)10]+ has been synthesized by combining the metalloradical [Fe(CO)5]+&#8901; with half an equivalent of Mn2(CO)10. The complex was subsequently isolated and characterized using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;Ray Diffraction (scXRD), as well as IR, Raman, NMR and M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy. Experimental results, complemented by DFT calculations of the relaxed force constants and an analysis of the electron density, reveal that the interaction between the two {M(CO)5} fragments in [MnFe(CO)10]+ is in between a covalent and a dative bond, representing a borderline case between the 2x17&#8197;VE and the 16+18&#8197;VE electron counting. Additionally, the known isoelectronic anion [CrMn(CO)10]&#8722; was prepared as its [PPN]+ salt and characterized for the first time by scXRD. These finding complete the series of structurally characterized isoelectronic dimetal decacarbonyls, spanning from [Cr2(CO)10]2&#8722; to [Fe2(CO)10]2+, the characteristics of all of which are compared based on experiment and theory.

         <title>Regulating the Ligand N&#8208;Heterocyclic Coordination in Bismuth&#8208;Based MOFs for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of one N&#8208;heterocyclic pyridine group within the ligand led to an enhanced localized internal electric field (LIEF), which could promote efficient charge separation and enhance the interaction with CO2 molecules, thus improving photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance.







Abstract
The increasing global concern over environmental degradation and resource depletion has driven the search for sustainable technologies to mitigate CO2 emissions. Recently, bismuth&#8208;based metal organic frameworks (Bi&#8208;MOFs) have garnered significant attention due to their high stability, adjustable porosity, and excellent light absorption properties. However, weak visible light absorption and charge recombination are still obstacles to wide application. In this study, a new class of Bi&#8208;MOFs based on tribenzoic acid with different ligand N&#8208;atom number was synthesized by solvothermal method. Experimental and computational results indicated that the introduction of one N&#8208;heterocyclic pyridine group within the ligand led to an enhanced localized internal electric field (LIEF), which could promote efficient charge separation and enhance the interaction with CO2 molecules, thus improving photocatalytic activity. This study highlights the potential of pyridine&#8208;functionalized ligands for the design of high&#8208;performance MOFs for CO2 reduction, providing valuable insights for the development of advanced materials in environmental sustainability efforts.

         <title>4&#8208;Exo&#8208;Trig Radical Cyclization: A Promising Approach to Four&#8208;Membered Rings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig radical cyclization is an attractive method for direct construction of synthetically important but challenging four&#8208;membered rings. This review systematically summarizes the recent advances in this field over the past 20&#8197;years, including processes enabled by SmI2, n&#8208;Bu3SnH, transition metal catalysis, and photocatalyst, respectively, with an emphasis on the analysis of reaction mechanism and selectivity control.







Abstract
The 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig radical cyclization represents a formidable challenge owing to the unfavorable thermodynamics associated with the formation of highly strained four&#8208;membered rings. Stimulated by the explosive advancements of radical chemistry over the past decades, significant progresses have been made in this area, including the SmI2&#8208;mediated 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig carbonyl&#8208;alkene cyclization, n&#8208;Bu3SnH&#8208;mediated 4&#8208;exo cyclization of functionalized alkenes or alkynes, transition metal&#8208;catalyzed 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig ring closures, and visible light&#8208;induced 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization cascade, providing efficient protocols to overcome the inherent limitations and expand the synthetic utility of this methodology. Representative examples, reaction mechanism, scope and limitations, and synthetic applications are presented and discussed in detail. We believe that the systematic review of recent advances on 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig radical cyclization will provide more insights in this field, and may enable further development of this cyclization process for the concise synthesis of four&#8208;membered carbo&#8208; and heterocycles that are difficult to access via traditional methods.

         <title>31P NMR Study of P&#8208;Chirogenic Phosphaphenanthrenes with Molecular Flexibility tuned by Amino Acid Substituents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
P&#8208;chirogenic phosphaphenanthrenes prepared as pairs of diastereomers served as model compounds for 31P NMR study probing the effect of molecular flexibility on NMR parameters. X&#8208;ray diffraction determined absolute configuration and revealed P&#8722;O flip of the P&#8208;ring. Interestingly, conformation of the P&#8208;ring is directed by H&#8208;bonding patterns. Conformational space was also explored by theoretical methods and diagnostic 31P parameters were investigated.







Abstract
Model phosphonamidates derived from 9,10&#8208;dihydro&#8208;9&#8208;oxa&#8208;10&#8208;phosphaphenanthrene&#8208;10&#8208;oxide (DOPO) with molecular flexibility tuned by amino acid substituents were prepared as pairs of diastereoisomers (DSIs) differing in configuration on phosphorus atom. X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) determined absolute configuration on phosphorus and revealed conformational flexibility of six&#8208;membered oxa&#8208;phospha&#8208;cycle. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations combined with machine learning provided 2&#8211;4 representative conformers from each DSI present in solution. 31P chemical shift of RS DSIs was higher compared to the SS ones. Calculated 31P&#8208;1H as well as 31P&#8208;13C J&#8208;couplings followed Karplus dependence of J&#8208;coupling values on dihedral angles between interacting nuclei, showing reasonable match with the literature data. The effect of molecular flexibility quantified by parameter nConf20 on NMR parameters was significant, especially for residual dipolar couplings (RDCs), where Pearson correlation factor R decreased with increasing nConf20 parameter.

         <title>Sustainable Diesel from Rapeseed Oil Esters by Sequential Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation, Double Bond Isomerization, and Metathesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article describes a robust, sustainable, and industrially viable three&#8208;step process to transform rapeseed oil methyl esters (RME) into biofuel with a boiling point curve that fulfills the modern diesel specifications for the use in contemporary diesel engines. This process consists of selective partial hydrogenation of RME, followed by heterogeneously&#8208;catalyzed double bond isomerization and cross&#8208;metathesis with ethylene.







Abstract
Rapeseed oil methyl esters (RME) have been converted to biofuel with a boiling point curve that fulfills the EN 590 specifications for modern diesel engines using a robust, three&#8208;step process. In the first step, the polyunsaturated esters of the RME were semi&#8208;hydrogenated in the presence of 20&#8197;ppm of a solvent&#8208;stabilized Pd0 colloid. The resulting mono&#8208;unsaturated fatty esters were further converted into a defined mixture of double&#8208;bond isomers by passing them over inexpensive, Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acidic Amberlyst 15 resin at high space&#8208;time yields (1.3&#8197;kg&#8901;L&#8722;1&#8901;h&#8722;1). The resulting mixture was then converted into a blend of terminally unsaturated olefins and monoesters, with &lt;4.9&#8201;% diesters and &lt;21&#8201;% saturated fatty esters by cross&#8208;metathesis with technical&#8208;grade ethylene. In this step, 50&#8197;ppm of a cyclic alkyl amino carbene (CAAC) Ru catalyst M1001 was used to achieve record&#8208;setting conversions (91&#8201;%) and selectivities (94&#8201;%). All three steps were conducted with neat feedstock at mild temperatures (60&#8211;100&#8201;&#176;C). This demonstrates that sustainable diesel fuel for use in contemporary diesel engines is accessible from RME and ethylene via a short set of industrially viable reaction steps.

         <title>Adaptive Coordination Behavior of Bisphosphanylphosphanido&#8208;Ligands Toward Group 2, 11 and 12 Metal Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combination of 2, 11 and 12 metal ions with a bisphosphanylphosphanide counter anion affords versatile and adaptive coordination motifs, for which NMR parameters (1JPP) serve as an easy and reliable diagnostic tool consistent with the situation in solid state as corroborated by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography.







Abstract
A series of alkaline earth metal complexes (Mg&#8722;Ba) with the anionic ferrocenylene&#8208;bridged bisphosphanylphosphanide ligand [Fe(C5H4PC4H9)2P]&#8722; has been prepared by metalation of the corresponding bisphosphanylhydrophosphane (Fe(C5H4PC4H9)2PH). The resulting complexes have been characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and SC&#8208;XRD. Furthermore, the closely related zinc phosphanide, and rare, mononuclear coinage metal phosphanides were synthesized and investigated for comparison. The range of coordination modes observed for the phosphanide ligand included mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, and tridentate modi and their respective combinations, whereas no &#956;2&#8208;bridging of the phosphanide center has been observed. The value of the 1JPP coupling constant was found to be a good probe to track the coordination motif consistent with the situation in solid state.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of alkaline earth metal complexes (Mg&#8722;Ba) with the anionic ferrocenylene-bridged bisphosphanylphosphanide ligand [Fe(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;PC&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; has been prepared by metalation of the corresponding bisphosphanylhydrophosphane (Fe(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;PC&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PH). The resulting complexes have been characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and SC-XRD. Furthermore, the closely related zinc phosphanide, and rare, mononuclear coinage metal phosphanides were synthesized and investigated for comparison. The range of coordination modes observed for the phosphanide ligand included mono-, bi-, and tridentate modi and their respective combinations, whereas no &lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-bridging of the phosphanide center has been observed. The value of the &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;PP&lt;/sub&gt; coupling constant was found to be a good probe to track the coordination motif consistent with the situation in solid state.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The cooperation of Pd center and Lewis acid sites to achieve high selectivity towards kinetic carbonate product for oxidative carbonylation reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dimethyl carbonate and dimethyl oxalate are competitive products of the carbonylation reaction of methyl nitrite (MN) under Pd&#8208;based catalysts. The chemo&#8208;selectivity is influenced not just by the thermodynamic constraints of reaction conditions but also by the electronic structures of catalysts. Lewis acid sites are extensively employed to modulate the electronic structures of Pd active sites for kinetic carbonate production, but their precise role remains unclear. Herein, we employed a combination of reaction kinetic, in situ DRIFTS experiments and DFT calculation, unveiling the indispensable role of Lewis acid sites in activating MN and facilitating the transfer of *OCH3 species, which is the key to obtain the kinetic carbonate outcome. The molecular understanding reveals the cooperation of Pd center and Lewis acid sites in directing selectivity towards carbonate product, which enables the rational design of higher&#8208;performance catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Catalysed Formation of Hydrocarbon Scaffolds from Geranylgeranyl Diphosphate Analogs with Shifted Double Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four analogs of geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) with shifted double bonds were synthesised and enzymatically converted with 14 diterpene synthases of previously reported function, including two newly characterised homologs of the benditerpe&#8208;2,6,15&#8208;triene synthase Bnd4 and the venezuelaene synthase VenA. In successful cases the products were isolated and structurally characterised by NMR spectroscopy, revealing the formation of various diterpenoids with skeletons that have not been reported from natural sources. Isotopic labelling experiments in conjunction with DFT calculations were performed to give insights into hydride migrations in the biosynthesis of the non&#8208;natural diterpenes benditerpe&#8208;2,7(19),15&#8208;triene and venezuelaxenene and their natural counterparts from GGPP.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescent Trityl&#8208;based Diradicaloids: A Theoretical and Experimental Assessment of Charge&#8208;Resonance in Low&#8208;Lying Excited States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl radical (TTM) has inspired the synthesis of several luminescent diradicaloids, providing an extraordinary opportunity to control the nature of the low&#8208;lying&#160;excited states by fine&#8208;tuning the diradical character. However, the photophysical properties of TTM&#8208;derived diradicals remain not fully understood yet. Here we present a combined theoretical and experimental investigation to elucidate the origin of their luminescence. The theoretical analysis explores a series of symmetric TTM&#8208;derived diradicals with singlet ground state and increasingly longer &#960;&#8208;conjugated spacers between&#160;radical moieties, focussing on the nature of the lowest excited electronic states governing their photophysics. The study is complemented by a complete spectroscopic characterization of the TTM&#8208;TTM diradical, synthesized using a novel, simpler and more efficient procedure exploiting the unique reactivity of TTM. The diradicals feature two novel low&#8208;lying excited states, absent in TTM, arising from charge resonance (CR) between the radical units. The lowest CR state is a characterized by the H,H &#8208;&gt; L,L double excitation (DE) and is a dark state for symmetric diradicals. The CR nature explains the blue&#8208;shifted emission observed by increasing the distance between the radical centres as seen in TTM&#8208;ph&#8208;TTM. This insight suggests different design strategies to improve the luminescence properties of TTM&#8208;derived diradicals</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of a 2nd Sphere Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Donor on the Reactivity of Non&#8208;heme Fe(II) Complexes in Alkane, Alkene and Aromatic Oxidation with H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two iron(II) complexes of the pentadentate aminopyridine ligand L52(OH), bearing a 2nd sphere OH group in ortho position of one pyridine, were studied in the oxidation of various substrates using H2O2. While the addition of the OH group lowers the yields of alkane and aromatic oxidation, it improves the yield in alkene epoxidation. Spectroscopic analyses suggest that the pyridine&#8208;OH group stabilizes an Fe(III)OOH intermediate by hydrogen&#8208;bonding with the proximal O atom of hydroperoxo, but also eventually drives the system towards a dimeric structure, which competes with the oxidation process. The improvement in epoxidation yields is proposed to result from the fast reaction of cyclooctene with the active species, together with an enhanced oxidizing power induced by the hydrogen&#8208;bonding pattern.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Competition Reflected by Circularly Polarized Luminescence Signal Inversion in Supramolecular Assembly of Pyrene&#8208;Amino Acid Derivatives and &#947;&#8208;Cyclodextrin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral competition between carbohydrates and amino acids is crucial for understanding homochirality emergence in biological systems. In this study, the chiral competitive effect between carbohydrates and amino acids through the host&#8208;guest complex formation was investigated by employing amino acid modified pyrene derivatives and naturally occurring &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#947;&#8208;CD) as chiral sources, the circularly polarized luminance (CPL) as indicator. Supramolecular complexes of achiral 1&#8208;pyrenebutyric acid and L&#8208;amino acid&#8208;pyrene derivatives with &#947;&#8208;CD exhibited positive CPL signals, which chirality derived from &#947;&#8208;CD&#8217;s stereochirality. In contrast, supramolecular complexes formed by D&#8208;amino acid&#8208;pyrene derivatives with &#947;&#8208;CD showed a negative CPL signal, reflecting chiral competition between D&#8208;amino acids and D&#8208;glucose in &#947;&#8208;CD. The observed CPL signal inversion confirmed that the amino acids stood out as the dominant chiral source in chiral competition with carbohydrates. Mechanism exploration showed that the depth of insertion and stacking arrangement of the guest molecules within the &#947;&#8208;CD cavity played an essential role for the CPL inversion. Interestingly, chiral competition only occurred between D&#8208;amino acids and D&#8208;carbohydrates, while cooperation was observed between L&#8208;amino acids and D&#8208;carbohydrates, which were consistent with the natural chirality bias. This work provides new insights into homochirality emergence and the design of functional chiral materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Ultramicroporous Organic&#8208;Linked Zincophosphate with High Thermal, Chemical and Water Stabilities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The application of ultramicroporous materials for CO2 separation is limited by the rarity of materials exhibiting stability and rapid scale&#8208;up characteristics. In this study, we propose a rational approach to enhance the structural stability and durability of the pillared layer structure. Through the topotactic replacement of protons with metal ions in the parent 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy)&#8208;pillared zincophosphate, we observed the formation of edge&#8208;sharing dimers of ZnO4N and PO4, as well as the insertion of (VOH2O)2+ into the zinc phosphate layers. This resulted in the modified bpy&#8208;pillared bimetal phosphate, [(VOH2O)(ZnPO4)2(bpy)]&#8729;4H2O (denoted as NTHU&#8208;16 or VZn&#8208;bpy&#8208;w), which exhibits exceptional structural stability in a wide pH range (pH 2&#8722;12) and boiling water. Additionally, a rapid scale&#8208;up process reduced the synthesis time of VZn&#8208;bpy&#8208;w from 48 hours to just 3 hours, significantly increasing efficiency. The vanadyl groups, with easily displaced coordinated water, enhance the strength of the inorganic sheets and create available metal sites for the adsorption and separation of CO2. This combined strategy of structural enhancement and rapid synthesis offers a new pathway for engineering stable, porous metal phosphates and designing novel organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials with potential applications in CO2 separation.</dc:description>

This resulted in the modified bpy-pillared bimetal phosphate, [(VOH2O)(ZnPO4)2(bpy)]&#8729;4H2O (denoted as NTHU-16 or VZn-bpy-w), which exhibits exceptional structural stability in a wide pH range (pH 2&#8722;12) and boiling water. Additionally, a rapid scale-up process reduced the synthesis time of VZn-bpy-w from 48 hours to just 3 hours, significantly increasing efficiency. The vanadyl groups, with easily displaced coordinated water, enhance the strength of the inorganic sheets and create available metal sites for the adsorption and separation of CO2. This combined strategy of structural enhancement and rapid synthesis offers a new pathway for engineering stable, porous metal phosphates and designing novel organic-inorganic hybrid materials with potential applications in CO2 separation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Computational Study of Alkyne&#8208;Acid Cycloisomerization in Gold&#8208;Functionalized Resorcinarene Cavitand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The binding and cycloisomerization of acetylenic acids to give the corresponding &#947;&#8208;lactones in a gold&#8208;functionalized resorcinarene&#8208;based cavitand are studied by means of density functional theory calculations. The reaction mechanism and selectivity are investigated for substrates with different substituents to assess the size&#8208;reactivity relationships. The influence of the cavitand walls on the reactivity and selectivity is examined using a stripped&#8208;down model.







Abstract
Herein, we report density functional theory calculations to investigate the reaction mechanism and the selectivity of the cycloisomerization of alkynoic acids inside a gold&#8208;functionalized resorcinarene&#8208;based cavitand. This cavitand has experimentally been shown to catalyze the cycloisomerization of a number of substituted alkynoic acids to give the corresponding &#947;&#8208;lactones. Three representative substrates, with different substitution patterns, are considered in the calculations, and for each of them, the geometries and energies of various binding modes are first characterized. Next, the cycloisomerization reaction mechanism is evaluated, which is shown to consist of an intramolecular addition of the carboxylic acid to the gold&#8208;activated alkyne triple bond, followed by a protodeauration step. Both 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig and 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclizations were considered, leading to &#947;&#8208; or &#948;&#8208;lactones, respectively, and the involvement of the triflate counterion in the cyclization step is discussed. Finally, the influence of the cavitand walls on the reactivity is evaluated by using a model catalyst in which the walls were removed.

         <title>Radionuclide&#8208;activated luminescence for cancer theranostics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Within dielectric media, charged particles emitted from medical radionuclides induce polarization of surrounding molecules, which subsequently generate Cerenkov luminescence (CL) upon returning to their ground state. This CL emission confers clinically approved radiotracers with distinctive potential for applications in phototheranostics. However, the utility of CL in vivo has been severely constrained by its ultraviolet&#8208;weighted emission spectrum and extremely low photon flux, particularly in living imaging and triggering photodynamic therapy. Certain optical probes, encompassing fluorescent agents and nanoparticle scintillators, can be activated by radionuclides to generate red&#8208;shifted emissions with amplified luminescence intensity compared to CL. This phenomenon, termed radionuclide&#8208;activated luminescence (RL), represents a promising strategy for enhancing radionuclide&#8208;induced tumor phototheranostic outcomes. This review systematically summarizes the advances in RL technology, highlighting the development of various RL probes and their innovative applications in laser&#8208;free optical bioimaging and cancer phototherapy. It further delves into the confronting challenges and prospects of RL technology, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview and practical insights to advance the integration of radiotheranostics and phototheranostics in clinical practice.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable G&#8208;Quadruplex Ligands: Azobenzene Derivatives for Light&#8208;Controlled DNA Modulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>During transcription, replication, and DNA repair, DNA unwinds to reveal guanine&#8208;rich sequences that form stable G&#8208;quadruplexes. In cancer cells, increased transcription and replication promote G4 formation, making them attractive therapeutic targets. G4s block DNA and RNA polymerases, inducing replication stress and causing toxic single&#8208; and double&#8208;strand breaks. Small&#8208;molecule ligands can stabilize G4 structures, prolonging their effects and exacerbating replication stress. However, most G4 ligands operate through a one&#8208;way mechanism that remains permanent over time. A more versatile approach involves systems that can switch between active and inactive states on demand using external stimuli, such as light. This study aims to deepen knowledge of the current state of the design of photoactive G4&#8208;ligand through the synthesis of azobenzene&#8208;based compounds that vary in substitution patterns, size of the substituent, electronic effects, and molecular structure. Using orthogonal biophysical methods and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, we evaluate how these factors affect the compounds&#8217; ability to bind and stabilize G4 structures. Importantly, our results demonstrate that the interaction mode of the trans isomer with G4 influences its ability to modulate G4 properties bidirectionally.These findings provide insights for designing photoactive G4 ligands with tunable on&#8208;off functionality, paving the way for precise control of G4 structures in biological systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Ag@Pd Nanocubes and Pd&#8208;based Nanoframes via One&#8208;shot Injection of a Halide&#8208;free Precursor for Continuous Production in a Flow Reactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Noble&#8208;metal open nanostructures have remarkable catalytic capabilities toward a wide range of reactions. In particular, Pd&#8208;based open nanostructures have been synthesized and validated for superior catalytic performance toward formic acid oxidation. However, most of the syntheses are based on dropwise addition, making it challenging to increase the production volume. In this work, we present a facile approach to the synthesis of Ag@Pd core&#8208;frame nanocubes and then Pd&#8208;based nanoframes through one&#8208;shot injection. In a typical synthesis, Ag nanocubes are dispersed in an aqueous solution of ascorbic acid and polyvinylpyrrolidone at room temperature, followed by the injection of Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2 precursor in one shot. The Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2 precursor has a much slower reduction kinetics relative to Na2PdCl4, preventing self&#8208;nucleation and enabling controlled deposition of Pd atoms on the Ag nanocubes. The lower reduction potential of Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2 also helps minimize the galvanic replacement reaction, facilitating uniform deposition of Pd atoms. After selectively etching away the Ag template, Pd&#8208;based nanoframes with a rigid cubic structure are obtained. Finally, the synthesis is successfully adapted to a continuous flow system, generating Ag@Pd nanocubes with comparable quality to those obtained via one&#8208;shot synthesis, demonstrating a practical route to large&#8208;scale production of Pd&#8208;based nanoframes with H2O2 etching.</dc:description>

         <title>A Rapid, Sustainable, One&#8208;step Mechanochemical Strategy for Synthesizing Gold Nanoparticle&#8208;Doped Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Doping gold nanoparticles within covalent organic frameworks (AuNPs@COFs) has garnered enormous momentum due to their unique properties and broad applications. Nevertheless, prevailing multi&#8208;step synthesis is plagued with low time efficiency, eco&#8208;unfriendliness, and tedious protocols. Herein, we introduce a rapid, sustainable, one&#8208;step mechanochemical strategy for synthesizing AuNPs&#8208;doped COFs via steel ball milling within an hour under ambient conditions. This approach overcomes the synthetic barriers of conventional multi&#8208;step methods, such as extended reaction times (5 days), the use of toxic solvents, elevated temperatures, and reliance on external reducing agents. One exemplary AuNPs@COF (AuNPs@DMTP&#8208;TPB) exhibits high crystallinity, porosity, small AuNP size, and uniform dispersion (5.4 &#177; 0.6 nm), surpassing its counterpart synthesized via multi&#8208;step solution&#8208;based methods (6.4 &#177; 1.1 nm). Control experiments suggest that the in situ formation of AuNPs is primarily attributed to the galvanic reduction of gold precursor by stainless steel. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept catalytic application, AuNPs@DMTP&#8208;TPB demonstrates remarkable catalytic activity and recyclability for the aqueous reduction of 4&#8208;nitrophenol under ambient conditions. This study provides an environmentally benign and fast pathway to synthesize AuNPs@COFs via mechanochemistry for the first time, opening tremendous possibilities for heterogeneous catalysis and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered Reversible Helicity Switching of a Rotor by a Photo&#8208;Responsive Plier</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling synchronized motion and transmission of molecular motion to a remotely located guest is not trivial. Here, we demonstrate a light&#8208;triggered, scissor&#8208;like conformational change in a molecular plier to reversibly alter the conformation and helical chirality of a noncovalently bound rotor guest. The plier comprises three building blocks: an azobenzene unit that controls the open&#8208;close motion of the plier upon light&#8208;activated isomerization from E to Z, a BINOL unit that serves as both a hinge and a chiral inducer and two pyridine moieties that can form a complex with the rotor guest. The light&#8208;induced conformational alteration of the plier was unequivocally demonstrated by 1H NMR, UV&#8208;Vis, and CD spectroscopy. The open&#8208;close motion of the plier was translated to the rotor via a 1:1 host&#8208;guest complex. Indeed, CD spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, thermal back isomerization studies, and molecular modelling confirm that the light&#8208;triggered conformational alterations of the host can induce mechanical twisting and helicity switching in the guest.</dc:description>

         <title>Advances of Vanadium&#8208;based Cathodes forAqueous Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) have the advantages of high safety, low cost and environmental friendliness. Various cathode materials have attracted significant attention owing to a variety of crystal structures, multiple oxidation states, and high theoretical capacities. This review focuses on vanadium&#8208;based cathodes, including vanadium oxide, vanadium sulfide, vanadate and vanadium&#8208;carbon composites.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising for energy storage due to their high safety, low cost, and environmental friendliness. Vanadium&#8208;based materials, including vanadium oxides, vanadium sulfides, vanadate, and vanadium carbon composites, have gained attention for their diverse crystal structures, multiple oxidation states, and high theoretical capacities. This review summarizes recent advances in vanadium&#8208;based cathodes, focusing on structural design and modification strategies, such as amorphous structures, defect engineering, conductive carbon matrices, and cation pre&#8208;intercalation to enhance Zn2+ storage. Vanadium oxides and vanadium sulfides offer unique ion diffusion advantages, while vanadate and vanadium carbon composites improve conductivity and stability. Vanadate is highlighted as a critical approach to reduce electrostatic repulsion and facilitate Zn2+ storage. Vanadium carbon composites (V&#8211;MOF derivations, vanadium oxides @ carbon, combined with graphene and conductive polymer) have unique advantages in terms of conductivity, ion diffusion, and structural stability. Emerging materials like VN, VOPO&#8324; and V2CTx are also discussed. Future directions include multi&#8208;guest doping, anion pre&#8208;intercalation, and advanced carbon integration. This review aims to guide the development of high&#8208;performance AZIBs and inspire future research in this field.

         <title>The Lassa Virus Stable Signal Peptide Undergoes a Conformational Change to Aid Viral Fusion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique stable signal peptide (SSP) of the Lassa virus glycoprotein complex undergoes a conformational change during pH&#8208;dependent viral fusion. This revels a potential mechanism by which the enigmatic SSP influences the fusion process through interactions it makes with the fusion protein, glycoprotein 2 (GP2).







Abstract
A critical event in the lifecycle of the Lassa virus (LASV) is membrane fusion, where the viral membrane merges with the host cell membrane. This process is initiated by the LASV surface glycoprotein complex (GPC) upon exposure to the acidic environment of the endocytic pathway. A unique aspect of the GPC is the stable signal peptide (SSP), located adjacent to the transmembrane region of glycoprotein 2 (GP2), the primary fusion subunit. While previous research has established the importance of SSP in fusion, its precise role remains to be determined due to limited biophysical data. Our study aims to elucidate SSP's role by examining its structural changes. We discovered that SSP is predominantly &#945;&#8208;helical in its prefusion state at pH&#8197;7. However, when the pH is lowered to mimic the late endosomal environment (&lt;pH&#8197;5), SSP undergoes a structural change, increasing its helical content. Moreover, we demonstrate that SSP directly enhances fusion at these acidic pH levels. In conclusion, our findings suggest that SSP undergoes a critical conformational change at low pH, which is essential for its role in the LASV fusion mechanism, thereby deepening our understanding of LASV fusion.

         <title>Unveiling the Dual Nature of the Smallest Aqueous Ferrocene Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intricate structure of ferrocene&#8208;water complexes has been unveiled using advanced rotational spectroscopy and computational methods. The nature of the noncovalent interactions at the two binding sites observed at ferrocene the exo &#960; cloud and the planar orbit around iron are unveiled. The nearly free rotational dynamics of water within these complexes is highlighted.







Abstract
The structure of the ferrocene&#8208;water ((Cp)2Fe:H2O) complex has been characterized by combining state of the art rotational spectroscopy and computational chemistry. Two structures have been retrieved experimentally where water interacts with two distinguished binding sites, the exo Cp &#960; cloud and the planetary&#8208;like planar orbit around iron. The spectra of both conformers exhibit significant averaging effects due to the nearly free rotational dynamics of water. This is in good agreement with the exploration of the potential energy surface of (Cp)2Fe:H2O. For water interacting with the exo Cp &#960; cloud, we found three axial conformers giving rise to twenty minima with small internal rotation barriers. Theoretical calculations reveal two minima for the observed equatorial complex. Water interacts with ferrocene quite strongly, exhibiting binding energies above &#8722;11&#8197;kJ/mol in all binding sites and contributing to small deformations in the structure of bare ferrocene.

     alt="Unveiling the Dual Nature of the Smallest Aqueous Ferrocene Complex"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intricate structure of ferrocene-water complexes has been unveiled using advanced rotational spectroscopy and computational methods. The nature of the noncovalent interactions at the two binding sites observed at ferrocene the exo &#960; cloud and the planar orbit around iron are unveiled. The nearly free rotational dynamics of water within these complexes is highlighted.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structure of the ferrocene-water ((Cp)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) complex has been characterized by combining state of the art rotational spectroscopy and computational chemistry. Two structures have been retrieved experimentally where water interacts with two distinguished binding sites, the &lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt; Cp &#960; cloud and the planetary-like planar orbit around iron. The spectra of both conformers exhibit significant averaging effects due to the nearly free rotational dynamics of water. This is in good agreement with the exploration of the potential energy surface of (Cp)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. For water interacting with the &lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt; Cp &#960; cloud, we found three axial conformers giving rise to twenty minima with small internal rotation barriers. Theoretical calculations reveal two minima for the observed equatorial complex. Water interacts with ferrocene quite strongly, exhibiting binding energies above &#8722;11&#8197;kJ/mol in all binding sites and contributing to small deformations in the structure of bare ferrocene.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oxidative Addition&#8208;Reductive Elimination Supported by a Ligand&#8208;Element Cooperation at the Arsinidene and Stibinidene Center</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes a remarkable reactivity of N,C,N&#8208;coordinated stibinidene and arsinidene that includes oxidative addition, tautomerization and reductive elimination steps that are allowed via so&#8208;called element ligand cooperation. The whole reaction sequence is studied form both experimental and theoretical point of view.







Abstract
The treatment of pnictinidenes [2&#8208;(RNHCH2)&#8208;6&#8208;(RN=CH)C6H3]E (1As/Sb) (where E=As or Sb) with benzoyl peroxide provided compounds [2&#8208;(DippNCH2)&#8208;6&#8208;(DippN=CH)C6H3]E(O2CPh) (2As/Sb) as a result of two step procedure, i.&#8201;e. oxidation of the pnictogen centre followed by the elimination of benzoic acid. The reaction between 1As and diphenyl disulfide proceeded in the same vein yielding thiophenol and [2&#8208;(DippNCH2)&#8208;6&#8208;(DippN=CH)C6H3]As(SPh) (3As). Analogous reaction of 1Sb furnished a mixture of [2&#8208;(DippNHCH2)&#8208;6&#8208;(DippN=CH)C6H3]Sb(SPh)2 (3'Sb), [2&#8208;(DippNCH2)&#8208;6&#8208;(DippN=CH)C6H3]Sb(SPh) (3Sb) and PhSH, while NMR studies proved the existence of a dynamic equilibrium between all three compounds in solution and removal of incipient PhSH was necessary for the isolation of 3Sb. Both 1As/Sb smoothly reacted with 2&#8208;nitrosotoluene leading to [2&#8208;(DippNCH2)&#8208;6&#8208;(DippN=CH)C6H3]E(O&#8208;NH&#8208;2&#8208;Me&#8722;Ph) 4As/Sb and with 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazoline&#8208;3,5&#8208;dione giving [2&#8208;(DippNCH2)&#8208;6&#8208;(DippN=CH)C6H3]E[(N(CO)&#8208;NH(CO))N&#8722;Ph] 5As/Sb. All compounds were characterized by IR, Raman, NMR spectroscopy, and the molecular structures, except for 3As and 5Sb, were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Furthermore, we scrutinized the thermally induced reductive elimination of benzoic acid and thiophenol from 2&#8211;3As/Sb, respectively, and that of 4&#8208;phenylurazole from 5As. These eliminations involve C&#8722;H activation at the CH2N group, and the recovery of the pnictinidene center in [2,6&#8208;(RN=CH)2C6H3]E (6As/Sb). Using DFT calculations a plausible mechanism was suggested for all the investigated reactions, which are in good agreement with the experimental observations.

         <title>Structural Elucidation using Highly Sensitive Labeling Reagents and Total Synthesis of Amoxetamide A, a New Anoikis Inducer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complete stereochemical determination of amoxetamide A, a new anoikis inducer, was achieved. The structure was determined by using original highly sensitive labeling reagents with consuming only trace amount (ca 10 &#956;g) of natural sample. Moreover, the total synthesis of the unstable natural product is also reported. This first total synthesis of amoxetamide A enabled the confirmation of its structure and anoikis inducing activity.







Abstract
Amoxetamide A is a new anoikis inducer identified in the combined&#8208;culture broth of Amycolatopsis sp. 26&#8211;4 and Tsukamurella pulmonis TP&#8722;B0596. Although its planar structure has been determined through extensive NMR studies, its stereochemical structure remains to be elucidated due to the limited amounts of available samples. Herein, we report its stereochemical determination using our original labeling reagents and chemical synthesis, which was realized by consuming trace amount (ca 10 &#956;g) of natural sample. Moreover, the total synthesis of amoxetamide A is reported. Undesired intramolecular cyclization of an intermediate accelerated by the Thorpe&#8211;Ingold effect was completely avoided by using acyl sulfonamide as a protecting group of carboxylic acid. This first total synthesis of amoxetamide A enabled the confirmation of its stereochemistry and anoikis inducing activity.

         <title>Endowing Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons with Induced Supramolecular Chirality by Engineering Cation&#8208;&#960; Interaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cation&#8208;&#960; interaction is a crucial noncovalent binding force prevalent in many biological and chemical systems, however, are rarely reported in chiral supramolecular systems. Here, a supramolecular chiral system is reported, wherein cation&#8208;&#960; interaction play significant roles. The interaction involves a chiral cationic palladium complex (R&#8208;Pd) co&#8208;assembling with 12 different polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), resulting in the formation of supramolecular gels in mixed solvents. This co&#8208;assembly induces supramolecular chirality in the PAHs, with cation&#8722;&#960; interaction identified as the primary driving force. The confirmation of this interaction is supported by high&#8208;resolution mass, 1H NMR, nuclear overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY), XRD and CD. Most importantly, with the synergy of hydrogen bonds, the cation&#8208;&#960; interaction can be stabilized in a mixed solvent containing water, leading the co&#8208;assembly to form supramolecular gel, as well as enhanced chiral induction of PAHs. This discovery serves as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle example showing how the weak cation&#8722;&#960; interaction could be a powerful guide in attaining induced chirality of PAHs.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of [3]Rotaxanes with Two Oligo(para&#8208;phenylene) Axles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oligo(para&#8208;phenylene) (PPn) is a &#960;&#8208;conjugated compound where phenylene units are directly connected at the 1,4&#8208;positions. Utilizing the catalytic activity of the macrocyclic dihydrodibenzophenanthroline&#8208;Ni complex, we succeeded in the synthesis of [3]&#8208; and [2]rotaxanes with PPn axles by biaryl coupling. The size of the macrocycle was critical to synthesize [3]rotaxanes, which consist of two oligo(para&#8208;phenylene) axles, in good yields. The relationship between the length of the PPn structure on the 1H NMR spectra of the rotaxanes was studied. The aggregation of a PP8 derivative was suppressed by the presence of the macrocycle in the rotaxanes. A [3]rotaxane could be considered as a model compound of an aggregated PPn, and the photophysical studies disclosed the influence of the aggregation on the properties of PPn.</dc:description>

         <title>Size&#8208;Dependent Ultrafast UV Photochemistry of Aliphatic Disulfides in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have investigated the photochemistry of dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) and glutathione disulfide (GSSG) in solution upon ultraviolet (UV) excitation in comparison to L&#8208;cystine by femtosecond X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy at the sulfur K&#8208;edge. For these aliphatic disulfides, the very similar differential absorption spectra reveal unequivocally a pair of geminate thiyl radicals as the single primary reaction product with a formation time constant of about 100 fs. We find size&#8208;dependent majority yields for disulfide recombination with DMDS reforming ten&#8208;fold slower and at lower quantum yield than L&#8208;cystine while GSSG recombines even faster than L&#8208;cystine at a yield of nearly 80 % within 2 ps after excitation. We attribute the much lower recombination rates and yields of DMDS to larger product separation after homolytic S&#8208;S bond cleavage due to the smaller thiyl radical mass and correspondingly larger mutual acceleration. Furthermore, we observe the delayed formation of at least one additional reaction product of these disulfides that we attribute to perthiyl radicals. The ultrafast recombination of L&#8208;cystine and GSSG at majority yield in condensed phase suggests a dynamic S&#8208;S bond integrity which may be exploited in natural systems to mitigate UV radiation damage, and which could be of interest in materials design.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Decomposition Temperature: A Structural Study of Ligand Directed Bonding and Fluxionality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the first study of its kind towards the design and synthesis of easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle aluminium precursors that decompose at temperatures &lt;200&#160;&#176;C: informed ligand choice and structural design of the compounds has caused inbuilt fluxionality leading to a markable decrease in the onset of decomposition temperatures. Eight thiourea ligands [L1H&#8211;L8H] were chosen with the steric bulk on the N atoms of these ligands varied systematically [L1&#8208;4H: RN(H)CS(NMe2) and L5&#8208;8H: RN(H)CS(NEt2); R = Me (L1H and L5H), Et (L2H and L6H), iPr (L3H and L7H) and Ph (L4H and L8H). Three families of aluminium compounds were synthesised by the reaction of these thiourea ligands with trimethylamine alane [Al(Lx)3 (1&#8211;7), trimethylaluminium [MeAl(Lx)2] (8&#8211;11) and triethylaluminium [EtAl(Lx)2] (12&#8211;14) respectively. The three most spatially encumbered compounds (Al(L3)3 (2), Al(L6)3 (5) and Al(L7)3 (6) are highly fluxional in solution and displayed lengthening of the Al&#8211;N bond as compared to the other compounds. Both factors directly affect the activation temperature of these compounds. The remaining compounds were not shown to display any of these behaviours and consequently have higher thermal decomposition temperatures. SCXRD, 1H and 13C{1H} NMR, variable temperature 1H NMR, MS and EA have been used to study the structure and solution dynamics of 1&#8211;14.</dc:description>

         <title>Mimicking the CuD Site of pMMO via a Copper Cage&#8208;Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mechanism of action of particulate monooxygenase&#160;(pMMO) has yet to be determined. The CuD&#160;site with two histidines&#160;and an asparagine coordinating to copper has been identified as a&#160;potential active site of pMMO. Here, we present a copper cage&#160;complex, that assembles this coordination sphere, being a structural&#160;mimic of the pMMO. The cage is capable to catalyze aerobic&#160;oxidations of organic substrates such as benzylic alcohols to&#160;aldehydes and hydroquinones to quinones. This is inspired by the reactivity that is observed for enzymatic active sites possessing copper.</dc:description>

         <title>Skeletal Editing of Isoindolines to Tetralins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A skeletal editing strategy for transforming isoindolines into tetralins involving rearrangement of sulfamoyl azide or triazanium salts.







Abstract
We present a skeletal editing strategy for transforming isoindolines into tetralins via a cascade N&#8208;atom removal deconstruction followed by a Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between in&#8197;situ generated o&#8208;quinodimethanes and activated alkenes. This approach features a broad substrate scope, excellent stereoselectivity, and high yields, demonstrating its applicability to complex bioactive compounds and natural products. Notably, case studies showcase the efficient construction of challenging spirocyclic and bridged systems, underscoring the method's versatility and potential for advancing applications in synthetic chemistry.

         <title>External Phosphate Binding Triggered Formation of Coordination Bridged Dimer of Macrocyclic Trinuclear Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A macrocyclic trinuclear Zn complex that demonstrates a unique dimerization through external molecular binding is reported. A trispap ligand with multiple inward chelating units realized the alignment of the metals and coordination sites. Replacement of the original acetate cap with phosphate anion, PO43&#8722;, which binds to the complex in a tripodal mode, generated an electrically&#8208;neutral moiety with available sites and facilitated dimer formation.







Abstract
Macrocyclic complexes with spatially&#8208;arranged coordination sites have the potential to create unique supramolecular systems that combine the precise switching of self&#8208;assembled structures with the coordinative recognition of specific molecules. We now report a macrocyclic trinuclear Zn complex that undergoes a unique dimerization by molecular binding from the outside. The multinuclear complex was synthesized from a trispap ligand, a designed macrocyclic trimer of an N,N,O&#8208;type tridentate chelating unit pap. This macrocyclic ligand is capable of fixing the metal centers and retaining their exchangeable coordination sites. The macrocyclic trimer reacts with zinc acetate to form the trinuclear complex, in which the coordination sites of the three zinc atoms are aligned perpendicular to the macrocyclic plane and capped with the acetates. Subsequently, phosphate anion, PO43&#8722;, coordinates from one side of the macrocycle in a tripodal manner. This phosphate binding produced an electrically&#8208;neutral complex moiety with available coordination sites on the other side of the macrocycle which leads to the formation of the coordination&#8208;bridged dimer.

         <title>Label&#8208;Free 3D Cell Imaging Using Hydrogels Functionalized with Switchable Iridium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A label&#8208;free imaging of cells in a 3D scaffold was achieved using switchable Ir&#8208;complexes, covalently linked to a hydrogel. The presence of unstained cells induces the &#8220;switch&#8208;on&#8221; of the luminescence from the Ir&#8208;complexes, allowing clear visualization of living cells.







Abstract
The use of fluorescent labels is the most common tool to visualize cells. However, the internalization of dye molecules often modifies the cell behavior. In this paper we demonstrate that it is possible to transiently label cells using a 3D scaffold, a hydrogel, covalently functionalized with luminescent cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes. The unique feature of our design is that the complexes are emissive only when they interact with the cell membrane while their emission is quenched in water. We exploited this feature to perform real&#8208;time and staining&#8208;free cell visualization and imaging. Iridium functionalized hydrogels are very weakly luminescent when immerged in culture media. When cells are added to them, they interact with the iridium complexes, covalently linked to the gel, and their lipophilic membrane &#8220;switches on&#8221; the luminescence enabling a clear and dynamic, real&#8208;time 3D visualization of cell proliferation. A complete photophysical and biological study of the materials is presented which demonstrates the potential of our methodology for 3D&#8208;realtime cell tracking.

A complete photophysical and biological study of the materials is presented which demonstrates the potential of our methodology for 3D-realtime cell tracking.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Luminescent Stable Triarylmethyl Diradical with an Axially Chiral Spacer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a novel boronic ester radical precursor, two units of a highly stable luminescent triarylmethyl radical were bridged with an axially chiral spacer for the first time. The resulting, diradical (R/S)&#8208;1 demonstrated high stability in solution under ambient conditions and exhibited a photoluminescence quantum yield of 10&#8201;%, along with circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in chloroform.







Abstract
Two units of a highly stable luminescent triarylmethyl radical (PyBTM) were bridged using a chiral octahydrobinaphthyl moiety, resulting in a diradical with sufficient stability to enable the measurement of its chiroptical properties. To synthesize this diradical, a novel boronic ester radical precursor, &#945;H&#8208;PyBTM&#8208;B(Epin), was designed. The use of this precursor significantly improved the yield and streamlined the preparation of stable luminescent radical&#8208;substituted molecules. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of the diradical was measured to be 10&#8201;% in chloroform. Furthermore, both circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) were successfully observed.

         <title>Confined Structural Water Molecules as Alternative Potential Emitters for Bright Photoluminescence of Thiolate&#8208;Gold Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlike conventional hydrogen&#8208;bonded water molecules, structural water molecules can form an interface electronic state with &#960;&#8208;bonding properties due to the spatial interaction of the p&#8208;orbitals of two O atoms at the nanoscale, thus acting as emitters for the bright photoluminescence of thiolate&#8208;gold complexes.







Abstract
The debate about water as an emitter has spanned nearly a century, but how it emits bright colors remains elusive. In this report, using the widely used Au(I)&#8208;alkanethiolate complex (Au(I)&#8208;SRs, R=&#8722;(CH2)12H) with AIE properties as a model system, by carefully manipulating the delicate surface&#8208;ligand interactions at the nanoscale interface, together with a careful spectral investigation and an isotopic diagnostic experiment of heavy water (D2O), we demonstrated that the structural water molecules (SWs) trapped in the nanoscale interface or space are the true emission centers of metal nanoclusters (NCs) and the aggregates of Au(I)&#8208;SRs complexes, instead of a well&#8208;organized metal core dominated by quantum confinement mechanics. Unlike conventional hydrogen&#8208;bonded water molecules, due to interfacial adsorption or spatial confinement, the p&#8208;orbitals of two O atoms in SWs can form strong electronic interactions through spatial overlap, thus constructing a set of interfacial states, one of which is characterized by &#960;&#8208;bonding, thus providing alternative channels (or paths) for the relaxation decay of the excited electrons. Using the one&#8208;dimensional free&#8208;electron gas model, the energy levels calculated by the Schr&#246;dinger equation are in perfect agreement with the experimental observations, further validating the SWs model.

         <title>Programming Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalysis: Investigation of Synthesis Methods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are crystalline, porous materials with exceptional potential as high&#8208;performance photocatalysts for applications such as hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide production. In this study, we systematically evaluates various synthesis methods to optimize the preparation of COFs, specifically targeting enhanced photocatalytic activity. Four different synthetic strategies including solvothermal synthesis, microwave synthesis, ultrasonic synthesis, and mechanochemical synthesis were explored to prepare TAPT&#8208;COF with identical molecular structures. Although all methods produced COFs with comparable crystallinity, porosity, and light absorption capacity, their photocatalytic efficiencies in hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide production varied significantly. Notably, the mechanochemical method, which involves ball milling to disrupt interlayer interactions and produce COF nanosheets, exhibited the highest photocatalytic performance, particularly in the COF&#8208;BM&#8208;30 min sample. This difference highlights the importance of morphology in photocatalytic activity. Our findings shed light on the impact of synthesis methods on COF properties and provide valuable guidance for molecular strategy development and industrial applications in photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Release by the Rotaxane and Pseudorotaxane Approach</title>

         <dc:description>The controlled release of target molecules is a relevant application in several areas, such as medicine, fragrance chemistry and catalysis. Systems which pursue this implementation require a fine&#8208;tune of the start and rate of the release, among other properties. In this scenario, rotaxane&#8208; and pseudorotaxane&#8208;based systems are postulated as ideal scaffolds to accomplish a precise cargo release, due to the special features provided by the intertwined arrangement. This short review covers advances towards the controlled release of different molecules using rotaxane&#8208; and pseudorotaxane&#8208;based systems, both in solution and in the solid state.</dc:description>

         <title>Pseudo&#8208;ring methodology to control the conformations of macrocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A pseudo&#8208;ring is a medium&#8208;sized cyclic structure, held together by a strong hydrogen bond, that can act as a mimetic of a covalently linked heterocycle. Molecules that contain pseudo&#8208;rings can switch between &#8220;open&#8221; and &#8220;closed&#8221; forms. This paper examines the utility of pseudo&#8208;ring constructs to control conformations and properties of macrocycles. The spectroscopic evidence suggests that the &#8220;open&#8221; and &#8220;closed&#8221; pseudo&#8208;ring&#8208;containing macrocycles differ in their three&#8208;dimensional characteristics, which results in markedly different lipophilicities. The dynamic nature of pseudo&#8208;rings has led to the emergence of tunable fluorescence that should be useful in environment&#8208;sensitive applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Phenylalanine&#8208;Based Amphiphilic Self&#8208;Assembled Materials: Gels or Crystals?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We prepared three simple molecules, that we chose as representative examples of amphiphilic and bolamphiphilic amino acid derivatives: N&#8208;lauroyl&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine (Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH), N&#8208;palmitoyl&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine (Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH), N,N&#8208;azeloyl&#8208;L&#8208;diphenylalanine Az&#8208;(Phe&#8208;OH)2, to study the influence of the aliphatic side chain on the formation of supramolecular materials. We found that Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH is a very efficient gelator in contrast with Az&#8208;(Phe&#8208;OH)2 that efficiently forms crystals, while Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH forms metastable hydrogels that slowly become crystals. We demonstrated by X&#8208;ray diffraction that Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH and Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH easily form hetero&#8208;intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the carboxylic and amidic groups, while Az&#8208;(Phe&#8208;OH)2 forms homo&#8208;intermolecular hydrogen bonds, i.e., the typical carboxylic ring dimer and chains between the amidic functions, which leads to an extended and robust 2D hydrogen bonding network. Moreover, Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH is more ordered than Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH and the comparison of these results clearly indicates that the reduced order of Pal&#8208;L&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH is the main reason for the efficiency of this molecule as supergelator.</dc:description>

         <title>Red&#8208;light Responsive Fluorescent Liposomes for Controlled Release&#160; of Carbon monoxide (CO) with Cytotoxic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an important gaseous signalling molecule. CO&#8208;releasing molecules/materials (CORMs) have been studied as a source of CO for therapeutic abilities. In this study, new fluorescent turn&#8208;on CO&#8208;releasing nanoscale liposomes are formulated and their CO&#8208;releasing potentials are studied under red light (625 nm).&#160; New amphiphilic fluorescent naphthalic anhydride appended with a manganese carbonyl complex (Nap&#8208;BpyCORM) has been reported for the red light controlled release of CO with fluorescent turn&#8208;on emission.&#160; To enhance the aqueous solubility and biocompatibility of Nap&#8208;BpyCORM, we incorporated it with bilayer phospholipid dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and cholesterol to form nanoscale liposomes. The red&#8208;light&#8208;induced CO&#8208;releasing ability of the liposomes was investigated by UV&#8208;vis, emission, and IR studies and myoglobin assay. The rate of CO release (t1/2 = 11.13 min) was observed to be slower in the case of the liposome that contains cholesterol (Nap&#8208;BpyCORM&#8208;Ves.1) compared to the liposome (t1/2 = 6.96 min) that only has DPPC (Nap&#8208;BpyCORM&#8208;Ves). Incorporation of cholesterol into liposomes has increased the stability of CORMs. New liposomes are non&#8208;toxic to cells, but in the presence of light, they show toxicity to cancer cells.&#160;These findings open new avenues for the development of light&#8208;induced CO&#8208;releasing compounds with improved biocompatibility and applicability in various therapeutic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerating toehold&#8208;mediated DNA strand displacement reaction using polyquaternium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement (TMSD) reaction is a widely used programming language in DNA nanotechnology, but its performance is significantly limited by slow kinetics, especially under low&#8208;concentration reactants. Herein, we report on polyquaternium&#8208;2 (PQ2) as an effective and efficient accelerator&#160;of TMSD reaction.&#160;We show that PQ2 could&#160;drastically increase the reaction constant of 1&#8208;nt TMSD by 105&#8208;fold.&#160;Significant acceleration of TMSD reactions with&#160;sub&#8208;nanomolar&#160;input has been successfully demonstrated in various TMSD&#8208;based catalytic amplifiers.&#160;By stabilizing DNA reactants and increasing their effective local concentrations,&#160;PQ2 enables much faster reaction kinetics in response to picomolar&#8208;level inputs while eliminating the dependence on toehold length, mitigating the inhibitory effect of secondary structures, maintaining a desired single&#8208;base discriminating power, and protecting TMSD system in serum. Also, it improves cascaded signal transmission over an 11&#8208;layer TMSD circuit with 26 rounds of TMSD reactions, with a half&#8208;completion time of only 5.3 minutes.&#160;The simple&#8208;to&#8208;use and low&#8208;cost PQ2 offers a promising solution for uncovering the full potential of DNA nanotechnology and will facilitate more efficient and versatile TMSD&#8208;based applications&#160;from sensitive biosensing to high&#8208;performance molecular computing.</dc:description>

         <title>Systematic Analysis of False&#8208;Positive CH4 Production in Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction: The Role of Solvent and Reagent Decomposition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction has emerged as a promising strategy for achieving carbon neutrality under mild reaction conditions. While methane (CH4) is widely regarded as a valuable target product in CO2 reduction studies, the reliability of such measurements can be compromised by unintended CH4 generation from solvent or sacrificial reagent decomposition during photoreactions. Herein, we systematically evaluate the stability of seven common solvents and five sacrificial reagents under visible&#8208;light irradiation (&#955; &gt; 420 nm) in CO2&#8208;, air&#8208;, and N2&#8208;saturated atmosphere, employing three distinct photosensitizers. Notably, acetone, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and triethylamine (TEA) were identified as high&#8208;risk reagents prone to photodecomposition, generating substantial CH4 yields of up to 2770 &#956;mol&#183;h&#8722;1&#183;L&#8722;1. Isotopic labeling experiments conclusively demonstrated that the source of CH4 originated from the solvents or sacrificial reagents rather than CO2. These findings highlight critical pitfalls in experimental design for photocatalytic CO2 reduction and emphasize the necessity of rigorous reagent screening to avoid artifactual methane production.</dc:description>

         <title>Global Spectral Analysis of Polaritonic Coupling of Multiple Organic Dyes to a Tunable Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot Resonator Operating with Mirror Separations up to 10&#8197;&#956;m</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate simultaneous strong coupling of two different J&#8208;aggregated dyes embedded in a tunable Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot resonator at mirror distances exceeding 10&#8197;&#956;m. The observed polariton modes can be modeled by a phenomenological Hamiltonian. Even at very large distances, there are hybrid polaritons present, which contain contributions from both dye molecules, making this system a promising platform for studying polariton&#8208;mediated energy transfer.







Abstract
We study strong optical coupling and the formation of hybrid polaritons by a donor&#8208;acceptor pair of J&#8208;aggregated dyes separated by up to 11&#8197;&#956;m in a tunable Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot resonator. Fitting a phenomenological Hamiltonian to the white light transmission spectra of different cavity&#8208;J&#8208;aggregate&#8208;configurations, for which several hundred spectra were recorded sequentially as function of cavity length, allows us to determine coupling energies as a function of the effective cavity distances. The theoretical analysis shows that certain hybrid polaritons contain contributions from both dyes, making this system a promising platform for polariton&#8208;mediated energy transfer at very large distances.

         <title>Deoxygenative Cyclopropanation of Aldehydes with Acyl&#8208;Stabilized Sulfur Ylides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we described a novel [1+1+1] deoxygenative cyclopropanation between sulfur ylides and aldehydes, which is distinctive from traditional epoxidation reactions. The method offers a straightforward approach for the synthesis of highly stereoselective, functionalized, and structurally diverse tertiary cyclopropyl thioethers. The reaction demonstrates a broad substrate scope and excellent compatibility with various functional groups, rendering it particularly suitable for the late&#8208;stage modifications of pharmaceuticals and natural products, as well as the synthesis of structurally diverse compounds. Additionally, &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted enals can also engage in the deoxygenative cyclopropanation reaction, instead of undergoing classic cyclopropanation through a Michael addition reaction&#8208;induced cyclization with sulfur ylides, thus yielding synthetically important vinylcyclopropanes with excellent chemoselectivity and diastereoselectivity.

         <title>Guest Molecules Containing Rich&#8208;electron Group Incorporation into Zn&#8208;based MOF for the Enhancement of Iodine Uptake</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guest molecules with rich&#8208;electron groups are successfully incorporated into a three&#8208;dimensional Zn&#8208;based MOF to obtain two composites, which exhibit higher iodine uptake capacities than the pristine one. The iodine adsorption kinetics and possible adsorption mechanism by these above mentioned materials are analyzed in detail. Meanwhile, the major iodine species of iodine&#8208;loaded complexes are also characterized.







Abstract
Radioactive iodine capture is a major concern for nuclear power generation and environmental protection. Many metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been designed and synthesized to adsorb iodine from vapor or solution, but most of them exhibited unsatisfactory iodine uptake performance because of the insufficiency of adsorption sites. Herein, we chose 1&#8208;vinyl&#8208;3&#8208;ethylimidazolium bromide (VIMB) and 1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane (DACH) with rich&#8208;electron group as guest molecules, respectively, and encapsulated them into a three&#8208;dimensional Zn&#8208;based MOF Zn&#8208;BINOL with large 1D channel (BINOL=(R)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diethoxy&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;4,4&#8242;,6,6&#8242;&#8208;tetrabenzoate), as a result, two efficient iodine adsorbents VIMB@Zn&#8208;BINOL and DACH@Zn&#8208;BINOL were obtained. The equilibrium iodine vapor adsorption amounts of them were 1448 and 1680&#8197;mg/g at 75&#8201;&#176;C, being about 2.1 and 2.4&#8197;times more than that of Zn&#8208;BINOL, respectively. This work will provide more synthetic methods on design and preparation of iodine adsorbents with good adsorption capacity.

         <title>Twisted Amide&#8208;Mediated Synthesis and Rapid Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship Study of Medium&#8208;Sized Cyclic Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient methodology for the synthesis of medium&#8208;sized cyclic peptides based on the twisted amide&#8208;mediated amidation strategy was developed. A variety of linear peptides with C&#8208;terminal diversity were synthesized by the &#8220;inverse&#8221; peptide synthesis and epimerization&#8208;suppressed fragment coupling. The resulting linear peptides were cyclized by the intramolecular twisted amide&#8208;mediated amidation to afford stereochemically pure cyclic peptides.







Abstract
Medium&#8208;sized cyclic peptides are expected to be ideal drug leads because these peptides combine the advantages, while compensating for the disadvantages, of small molecules and antibodies. Although medium&#8208;sized peptides can be produced by chemical synthesis, two major problems, namely (i) C&#945;&#8208;epimerization during C&#8208;terminal modification and (ii) side reactions in the cyclization, remain to be solved. These issues have hampered the synthesis of pure materials for bioassays, making it difficult to accomplish accurate structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) studies. Herein, we report an efficient synthesis of medium&#8208;sized cyclic peptides based on the twisted amide&#8208;mediated amidation strategy. First, a variety of linear peptides were synthesized by the &#8220;inverse&#8221; peptide synthesis and fragment coupling. Second, the C&#8208;terminus of the linear peptides were converted to twisted amides, which were then reacted with a variety of &#945;&#8208;amino acyl sulfonamides, realizing the rapid C&#8208;terminal diversification of peptides. Finally, the resulting linear peptides were cyclized by the intramolecular twisted amide&#8208;mediated amidation to afford stereochemically pure cyclic peptides. Using this strategy, total synthesis of acyl&#8208;surugamide A, the stereoselective synthesis of 13 non&#8208;natural analogs, and the discovery of potent antimicrobial/antifungal peptides beyond the natural product were also achieved.

         <title>Preparation Methods of Metal Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Concept highlights our efforts to develop efficient approaches for the high&#8208;yield preparation of metal nanoclusters with customized structures and properties, including kinetic control, seeded growth, in&#8197;situ two&#8208;phase ligand exchange, and metal exchange methods, directing the controllable syntheses and structural determinations of more than 200 metal nanoclusters.







Abstract
Metal nanoclusters, also known as ultrasmall nanoparticles, represent a promising class of nanomaterials due to their atomically precise characterizations and intriguing chemical&#8208;physical properties. The preparation is the cornerstone for advancing the nanocluster science, facilitating their structural determination, property investigation, and practical application. We have been devoted to exploring new and efficient approaches for the high&#8208;yield preparation of metal nanoclusters with customized structures and properties. We have proposed and developed four methodologies for the nanocluster preparation, including kinetic control, seeded growth, in&#8197;situ two&#8208;phase ligand exchange, and metal exchange. More than 200 metal nanoclusters have been synthesized and structurally determined, laying the foundation for the elucidation of structure evolutions and structure&#8208;property correlations. In this concept, we emphasized our progress in proposing and developing the synthetic mythologies of metal nanoclusters. This Concept hopefully provides researchers attempting to study the preparation methods of metal nanoclusters with several feasible synthetic routes.

We have proposed and developed four methodologies for the nanocluster preparation, including kinetic control, seeded growth, in&#8197;situ two-phase ligand exchange, and metal exchange. More than 200 metal nanoclusters have been synthesized and structurally determined, laying the foundation for the elucidation of structure evolutions and structure-property correlations. In this concept, we emphasized our progress in proposing and developing the synthetic mythologies of metal nanoclusters. This Concept hopefully provides researchers attempting to study the preparation methods of metal nanoclusters with several feasible synthetic routes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reaction of a Potassium Aluminyl with Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2 &#8208; Isolation of a Stable, Trimetallic Sn(I) Radical Anion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reaction of a potassium aluminyl with Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2 in benzene produces a [Sn4]4&#8211; cluster with edges composed of overlapping Sn 5p orbitals or three centre two electron Sn&#8211;Al&#8211;Sn bonds. Al(II) species produced during the reaction are trapped as a Birch reduction product. In methylcyclohexane (MCH) a trimetallic Sn(I) radical anion forms, with EPR spectroscopy showing the unpaired electron is located in an unhybridised 5p orbital on tin.







Abstract
The reaction of the potassium aluminyl K[Al(NON)] ([NON]2&#8211;=[O(SiMe2NDipp)2]2&#8211;, Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) with the stannylene Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2 in benzene afforded K3[(Sn4){Al(NON)}2{N(SiMe3)2}], containing a distorted tetrahedral Sn4&#8208;cluster. Computational analysis indicates that four of the edges in this unit are composed of Sn&#8211;Sn bonds, with the remaining two that are spanned by aluminium involved in three centre two electron (3c2e) Sn&#8211;Al&#8211;Sn bonds. The formation of Al(II) species during this reaction is indicated by the isolation of the dialuminated cyclohexadiene 1,4&#8208;[Al(NON)]2(&#956;&#8208;C6H6). Repeating the reaction in methylcyclohexane generated a thermally stable, trimetallic Sn(I) radical anion in K[Sn{Al(NON)}2]. Compared to all other reported Sn(I) radicals, its EPR spectrum is unique; the main turning points of its spectrum appear at g values above 2 and the Sn hyperfine coupling is substantially smaller in magnitude. These data, together with ENDOR measurements and DFT calculations show that the SOMO is entirely localised in an unhybridised 5p orbital, such that spin&#8208;orbit contributions to the g and Sn hyperfine tensors are quenched.

         <title>Rational Construction of a Pyrimido[2,1&#8208;b] Benzothiazole&#8208;Based Photoswitchable Smart AIE Material: A Theoretical Insight into Fluorescence Switching Mechanism of the Chimeric Dyad</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research explored a chimeric design strategy to integrate bisthienylethene into a pyrimido[2,1&#8208;b][1,3] benzothiazole AIEgen (PBTE) as the head group. The ultrafast intramolecular FRET which outcompetes the nonradiative decay was identified as the dominant channel for fluorescence quenching of PBTE&#8211;c. The excellent AIE photoswitching capability enabled its applications in erasable optical memory and multi&#8208;dimensional anti&#8208;counterfeiting.







Abstract
Currently, AIEgen&#8208;photochromics conjugates and intrinsic photochromic AIEgens are the two major molecular design strategies for photoresponsive AIE materials. However, these two strategies still have their own limitations. In our previous research, we discovered pyrimido[2,1&#8208;b][1,3]benzothiazole (PBT) as a novel core structure of AIEgens. We herein explored a chimeric strategy to rationally integrate photochromic bisthienylethene (BTE) as the orthogonal head group into a new PBT molecule (PBTE). Compared to the conventional design strategies, the compact chimeric design of PBTE not only well maintains the AIE and photochromic properties of the parent fragments but also leads to excellent AIE&#8208;photoswitching capability in both films and single crystals. Theoretical calculations revealed that MO energy level arrangement of PBTE reorganized upon photoisomerization and the fast vibrational relaxation (VR) along with internal conversion (IC) from S5 to S1 state may serve as a competitive channel for the fluorescence quenching of PBTE&#8211;c. Comparison of the kinetics of the nonradiative decay with those of the excited&#8208;state energy transfer (EET) processes clearly showed that the ultrafast intramolecular F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is the dominant cause of fluorescence&#8208;off state. The applications of PBTE in erasable optical memory material and multi&#8208;dimensional anti&#8208;counterfeiting have also been demonstrated.

         <title>Selective Hydrolysis by Engineered Cutinases: Characterization of Aliphatic&#8208;Aromatic Homo and Co&#8208;Polyesters by LC and LC&#8211;MS Methods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Analytical characterization of homo and co&#8208;polyesters: We have engineered a cutinase from T. cellulosilytica (Tc_Cut2NVWCCG) to improve its thermostability and catalytic performance and applied it along with the LCCWCCG enzyme to carry out the chemoselective hydrolysis of aromatic/aliphatic homo&#8208; and co&#8208;polyesters. An analytical workflow based on RPLC&#8208;UV&#8208;MS and SEC&#8208;MS provided insight into the monomer selectivity in the hydrolysis of co&#8208;polymers.







Abstract
The performance, biodegradability, and recyclability of polymers can be tuned during synthesis by adopting monomers with different chemical characteristics. Recent research has shown the aptness of some hydrolases to depolymerize polyesters under mild conditions compared to chemical approaches. Herein, we engineered a cutinase from Thermobifida cellulosilytica (Tc_Cut2NVWCCG) for improved thermostability (up to 91&#8201;&#176;C) and compared it with previously reported leaf&#8208;branch compost cutinase (LCCWCCG) for the hydrolysis of low molar mass substrates, as well as aliphatic and aromatic homo&#8208; and co&#8208;polyesters. For both enzymes, higher hydrolysis rates were observed for aliphatic compared to aromatic homo&#8208;polyesters. SEC&#8208;MS analysis revealed that the hydrolysis of aliphatic/aromatic co&#8208;polyesters occurred at the aliphatic monomers, significantly reducing the molecular weight and changing the end&#8208;group composition. These results underline the importance of co&#8208;polymer composition in the biodegradation of co&#8208;polymer systems and demonstrate the applicability of enzymes for the analytical characterization of synthetic polymers by selectively reducing their molecular weight. Finally, the discovery and engineering of highly active enzymes that can efficiently hydrolyze a wide variety of synthetic polyesters create new opportunities for their efficient recycling under mild conditions.

         <title>Design, Synthesis, and Biophysical Characterization of Pyridine Bis&#8208;Quinazoline Derivatives as Selective G&#8208;Quadruplex DNA Stabilizers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fifteen novel pyridine bis&#8208;quinazoline derivatives are designed, synthesized, and evaluated for their ability to selectively bind and stabilize G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) DNA. Biophysical assays reveal strong G4 stabilization and selectivity over double&#8208;stranded DNA, with propylamine linkers showing superior performance. Cell viability studies confirm intracellular activity and anticancer potential, highlighting these compounds as promising G4&#8208;stabilizing agents for drug development.







Abstract
Non&#8208;canonical G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) DNA structures play key roles in cellular regulation and are promising targets for cancer therapy. This study reports the design, synthesis, and biophysical evaluation of 15 novel pyridine bis&#8208;quinazoline derivatives for their ability to selectively bind and stabilize G4 DNA structures. The pyridine&#8208;bis&#8208;quinazoline central fragment was synthesized with various amine side chains via a 4&#8211;5&#8197;step sequence in high yields. Comprehensive analyses using different fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays, fluorescence intercalator displacement (FID), circular dichroism (CD), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) assays revealed strong G4 stabilization and selectivity over double&#8208;stranded DNA. The presence and composition of the aliphatic amine side chain proved critical and propylamine linkers exhibited superior performance, achieving &#916;Tm values exceeding 20&#8201;&#176;C and dissociation constants in the nanomolar range. Structural preferences were observed for parallel and hybrid G4 topologies, and the ligands induced minimal conformational changes in G4 DNA upon binding. Finally, cell viability assays on HCT&#8208;8 and HepG2 cancer cell lines revealed that most ligands effectively entered the cells and decreased cancer cell viability in a dose&#8208;dependent manner. These findings underline the potential of pyridine bis&#8208;quinazoline derivatives as selective G4&#8208;stabilizing agents, paving the way for further exploration in anticancer drug development.

Comprehensive analyses using different fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays, fluorescence intercalator displacement (FID), circular dichroism (CD), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) assays revealed strong G4 stabilization and selectivity over double-stranded DNA. The presence and composition of the aliphatic amine side chain proved critical and propylamine linkers exhibited superior performance, achieving &#916;T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; values exceeding 20&#8201;&#176;C and dissociation constants in the nanomolar range. Structural preferences were observed for parallel and hybrid G4 topologies, and the ligands induced minimal conformational changes in G4 DNA upon binding. Finally, cell viability assays on HCT-8 and HepG2 cancer cell lines revealed that most ligands effectively entered the cells and decreased cancer cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. These findings underline the potential of pyridine bis-quinazoline derivatives as selective G4-stabilizing agents, paving the way for further exploration in anticancer drug development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Development of Diverse Ligands and Catalysts Derived from Axially Chiral Cyclic Biphenyldiols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel kind of adjustable axially chiral cyclic biphenyl ligands and catalysts derived from axially chiral CYCNOLs have been developed. The variation of substituent groups at 2,2&#8242;&#8208;positions afforded diverse ligands and catalysts. The precise regulation of multi&#8208;sites including variation of substituent groups at 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;positions and ring sizes at 6,6&#8242;&#8208;positions, realized the high reactivity and stereoselectivity in asymmetric synthesis.







Abstract
The development of suitable chiral ligands and catalysts is a key factor in asymmetric organic synthesis. In this paper, we describe the design, synthesis and evaluation of a new kind of adjustable axially chiral cyclic biphenyl ligands and catalysts derived from axially chiral cyclic biphenyldiols, and four representative examples were performed well including enantioselective alkynylation of benzo[e][1,2,3]oxathiazine 2,2&#8208;dioxide under catalysis of (R)&#8208;cyclic [1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diol/ZnMe2, palladium&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative cycloaddition of 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;4&#8208;vinyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolan&#8208;2&#8208;one with 2&#8208;arylidenemalononitriles in the presence of axially chiral cyclic phosphoramidite ligand, and axially chiral cyclic phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition of styryl&#8208;1H&#8208;indole with cyclic 2,4&#8208;dienones and asymmetric Michael addition of indolizine to cyclopentenediones. The experiments showed that variation of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;substituent groups could provide different kinds of axially chiral cyclic ligands and catalysts, variation of steric and electronic properties (by changing substituent groups at the 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;positions) and dihedral angles (by changing ring sizes at 6,6&#8242;&#8208;positions) could greatly change catalytic efficiency of ligands and catalysts derived from axially chiral cyclic biphenyldiols. The high reactivity and stereoselectivity of the reactions were effectively achieved through the precise regulation of multi&#8208;sites on our axially chiral cyclic biphenyldiols.

         <title>Highly Defined Layered 2D Sulfur Nanosheets from 0D Sulfur Dots and their use in the Photocatalytic Oxidative Coupling of Aryl Amines to Aromatic Azo Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Formation of 2D multi&#8208;layered sulfur sheets from 0D sulfur dots with improved crystallinity, effective light harvesting, less exciton binding energy with effective free charge carriers separation for efficient photocatalytic activity.







Abstract
A highly defined multi&#8208;layered 2D sulphur nanosheets have been prepared from 0D sulphur dots by hydrothermal based growth process. Slow transformation of sulphur dots to sulphur sheets allow reorganization of elemental sulphur and sulphur containing functional groups, resulting higher crystallinity in sulphur nanosheets with respect to sulphur dots. It is further correlated with the detailed photophysical studies. Low temperature photoluminescence spectra confirm that the exciton binding energy of 2D sulphur sheets are lower than 0D sulphur dots. The exciton&#8208;phonon coupling is also higher in sulphur sheet with respect to sulphur dots. Overall, the photoinduced charge separation process improves throughout the highly defined 2D matrix of sulphur sheets. It is further supported by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and transient photocurrent studies. Finally, both sulphur dots and sulphur sheets have been used for photocatalytic azo bond formation where both photoinduced electrons and holes have been utilized simultaneously. Results suggest almost 3 folds enhancement in catalytic efficiency for sulphur sheets with respect to sulphur dots without any metal co&#8208;catalyst. Controlled experiments suggest that the azo bond formation happens through complete photocatalysis process. Detailed mechanism has been proved by identifying the intermediates and free radicals through photo&#8208;responsive EPR studies and various chemical scavenging experiments.

         <title>Design and Properties of Azaacene&#8208;Fused Porphyrins: Extending &#960;&#8208;Systems for NIR&#8208;II Absorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we provide the straightforward synthesis of new azaacene&#8208;fused porphyrins, accompanied by an in&#8208;depth investigation of their optical and electrochemical properties. These experimental findings were further supported by comprehensive theoretical calculations, providing valuable insights into the structure&#8211;property relationship of these compounds.







Abstract
A series of porphyrins featuring various azaacene moieties were designed with the aim to explore the structure&#8211;property relationships in extended azaacene systems. The introduction of azaacene groups significantly enhanced the solubility of these chromophores while directly influencing their electronic absorption and emission properties, enabling absorption at longer wavelengths. Protonation of the azaacene&#8208;fused porphyrins further extended their absorption into the NIR&#8208;II region. The &#960; system extension provided by the new appended diamino aromatic groups were therefore investigated through electrochemical, photophysical, X&#8208;ray diffraction structural studies and complemented by theoretical calculations.

Among the phosphorylated and phosphinoylated aminophosphonates a few derivatives revealed moderate cytotoxic effect.







Abstract
In order to make available new derivatives, diethyl &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;methylphosphonates were subjected to phosphorylation, phosphinoylation and even thiophosphinoylation by reaction with phosphoryl chlorides, diphenylphosphinoyl chloride, and with the mixture of diphenylchlorophosphine and elemental sulfur, respectively. The X&#8208;ray crystal structures of the diphenylphosphinoyl and the diphenylthiophosphinoyl derivatives revealed molecular and supramolecular similarities, as well as a few differences too. An essential conformation change, along with packing differences are attributable to a change of one heteroatom: an oxygen for a sulfur in one of the P=X function. The diethyl diethylphosphoryl&#8208;aminobenzylphosphonates showed the highest antiproliferative effects on multiple myeloma cells, while the thiophosphinoylated diethyl aminobenzylphosphonate was the most effective on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells.

         <title>Exploring n&#8208;&#960;* Electronic Transitions in Graphitic Carbon Nitride: Fundamentals, Strategies, and Photocatalytic Advances</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advancements in modulating n&#8208;&#960;* electronic transitions in g&#8208;C3N4 to extend its absorption edge and enhance photocatalytic activity. It covers mechanisms, strategies, and photocatalytic applications in hydrogen generation, CO2 other energy&#8208;related processes, and future research directions.







Abstract
Photocatalysis utilizes solar energy to drive redox reactions, offering a promising solution to global energy and environmental challenges. Up to now, graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) has been widely studied due to its unique organic structural framework and favourable electronic properties. However, its photocatalytic efficiency is often constrained by a limited light absorption range (up to ~460&#8197;nm) and modest charge&#8208;carrier mobility. Recent findings suggest that n&#8208;&#960;* electronic transitions can extend the absorption edge of g&#8208;C3N4 to approximately 600&#8197;nm, enhancing the activity. Herein, we first outline the fundamental structural and electronic features of g&#8208;C3N4, highlighting the role of both n&#8208;&#960;* electronic transitions. We then provide a comprehensive overview of various strategies for activating n&#8208;&#960;* transitions, emphasizing the necessity of distorting the planar and symmetric tri&#8208;s&#8208;triazine units to enable this transition.

     alt="Exploring n-&#960;* Electronic Transitions in Graphitic Carbon Nitride: Fundamentals, Strategies, and Photocatalytic Advances"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review highlights recent advancements in modulating n-&#960;* electronic transitions in g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to extend its absorption edge and enhance photocatalytic activity. It covers mechanisms, strategies, and photocatalytic applications in hydrogen generation, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; other energy-related processes, and future research directions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photocatalysis utilizes solar energy to drive redox reactions, offering a promising solution to global energy and environmental challenges. Up to now, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) has been widely studied due to its unique organic structural framework and favourable electronic properties. However, its photocatalytic efficiency is often constrained by a limited light absorption range (up to ~460&#8197;nm) and modest charge-carrier mobility. Recent findings suggest that n-&#960;* electronic transitions can extend the absorption edge of g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to approximately 600&#8197;nm, enhancing the activity. Herein, we first outline the fundamental structural and electronic features of g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, highlighting the role of both n-&#960;* electronic transitions. We then provide a comprehensive overview of various strategies for activating n-&#960;* transitions, emphasizing the necessity of distorting the planar and symmetric tri-s-triazine units to enable this transition. The subsequent sections demonstrate how modulating n-&#960;* transitions can broaden the light absorption spectrum and facilitate more efficient charge separation, thereby enhancing photocatalytic processes. Finally, we propose potential future directions for exploiting n-&#960;* transitions to further advance g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-based photocatalysts. This review aims to fill a gap in the literature by providing a focused summary of n-&#960;* transitions in g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and their significance for sustainable energy and environmental applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis, and Structural and Spectroscopic Analysis of Trielyl&#8208;Derived Complexes of Iron</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron aluminyl&#8208;, gallyl&#8208; and indyl&#8208;derived complexes of the type [(NON)EFe(CO)4]&#8722; (E=Al, Ga, In; NON=4,5&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;xanthene) have been synthesized, and the properties of the group 13 metallo&#8208;ligands compared by a combination of crystallographic, computational and IR/M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopic techniques.







Abstract
The reactivity of group 13 anions of the form [(NON)E]&#8722; (NON=4,5&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;xanthene, E=Al, Ga, In) towards Fe(CO)5 has been investigated. In the case of the aluminyl system, both reaction outcome and product structure are highly sensitive to the availability of the potassium counterion; sequestration by 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 is necessary to yield a species featuring a direct, unsupported Al&#8722;Fe bond. 2.2.2&#8208;Cryptand, by contrast, yields a species featuring bridging carbonyl ligands, while the use of no sequestering agent at all leads to isocarbonyl bridging to aluminium. Owing to their lower oxophilicity, the heavier congeners gallium and indium more straightforwardly deliver Fe&#8722;E bonded adducts (E=Ga, In). The series of trielyl iron complexes has been interrogated by structural and computational analyses, as well as by IR and M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopies, revealing a consistent shift in bond polarity and electron richness at iron as group 13 is descended. This in turn is consistent with the diminishing donor strength of the trielyl ligand with increasing atomic number.

         <title>Reversible Ring Oxidation of 48&#960; Planar Nonaphyrins to Open Shell 46&#960; dications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis and characterization of 48&#960; nonaphyrins, a novel class of planar expanded porphyrinoids exhibiting distinct redox properties compared to their 32&#960; congeners. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies reveal a heterocycle dependent structural planar topology in these macrocycles. These nonaphyrins display weak paratropic ring current effects and undergo reversible two&#8208;electron ring oxidation to yield the 46&#960; dicationic species. Unlike the 32&#960; congeners, these 46&#960; dications have been characterized as diradicalod in nature.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular Electron Transfer in Unsymmetric Azohetero&#8208;aromatic Radical Bridged Diruthenium(III) Set Up</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The article demonstrated the stabilization of MLCT excited state in structurally characterized unsymmetric N,N/N,O&#8722; donating azoheteroaromatic radical bridged (acac)2RuIII(&#956;&#8208;L3&#8226;&#8722;)RuIII(acac)2 (2, S=1/2) [L3= deprotonated 5&#8208;(diethylamino)&#8208;2&#8208;((6&#8208;methybenzo[d] thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)diazenylphenol, acac= electron rich acetylacetonate, N&#8208;N(azo) distance: 1.379(4) &#197;] via intramolecular electron transfer (IET) at the metal&#8208;azo interface. On the contrary, similar IET driven stabilization of MLCT excited state was failed to take place in N,N donating HL3 derived mononuclear counterpart (acac)2RuII(HL3) (1, S=0) with unperturbed azo function (N=N distance: 1.3361(18) &#197;) in spite of the fact of facile RuII/RuIII oxidation (0.28 V versus SCE) and azo reduction (&#8208;1.05 V versus SCE), presumably due to the influence of hydrogen bonding interaction at the back face of coordinated HL3. On the other hand, the use of electron poor bpy (2,2'&#8208;bipyridine) as a co&#8208;ligand facilitated exclusive generation of the mononuclear [(bpy)2RuIIL3]ClO4 ([3]ClO4, S=0) encompassing N,O&#8722;&#8208;donating L3 with neutral azo group (N=N distance: 1.317(6) &#197;), unlike N,N donating HL3 in 1 due to the impact of &#963;&#8208;donating acac versus &#960;&#8208;accepting bpy, which also devoided of IET step.

         <title>Working mechanisms for enhanced interface stability and electrochemical properties in dual&#8208;salt polymer electrolyte with in&#8208;situ electrolyte&#8208;cathode integration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have attracted much attention due to their excellent flexibility, strong interfacial adhesion and good processibility. However, the incompatibility at the electrode/electrolyte interface often results in increased impedance and rapid capacity attenuation. In this work, dual&#8208;salt composite solid electrolytes (CSEs) with an integrated electrolyte/cathode structure are prepared by in&#8208;situ ultraviolet (UV) photopolymerization. With the addition of the lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB), a robust, stable and low&#8208;resistance solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI) layer is established during electrochemical reduction, eventually improving the overall performance of all solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). The Li//Li symmetric cells with RTS&#8208;TH&#8208;2% LiDFOB ASSLB exhibit stable cycling for over 2000 h at at 0.1 mA cm&#8211;2@0.1 mAh cm&#8211;2. LiFePO4//Li full cells deliver a high discharge capacity (155 mAh g&#8211;1 at 0.5 C) and cycling stability (with the retention rate of more than 90% at 0.5 C after 100 cycles) at 60 &#176;C. This work provides a facile strategy to enhance electrodes compatibility with poly (ethylene glycol) acrylates (PEGAs)&#8208;based electrolytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Ecofriendly synthesis of a hybrid hydrogel incorporating silver nanoparticles: Biological and photocatalytic activities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present the synthesis and characterization of a hybrid material comprising silver nanoparticles embedded within a 3D hydrogel network. The use of an aqueous extract of Acanthus mollis as a natural reducing agent facilitates the synthesis process. Acanthus mollis is a perennial, invasive and leafy plant that is widely distributed across the planet. Sequential introduction of silver nitrate solution and the plant extract into the hydrogel yielded a homogeneous dispersion of nanoparticles. The hybrid material, which contains an approximate weight percentage of 9% silver, was characterized using various techniques, including scanning electron microscopy, high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet&#8208;visible spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. Remarkably, and in contrast to the initial hydrogel, the hybrid material was found to be stable at temperatures exceeding 100 &#176;C. This material offers a practical means for preserving silver nanoparticles by preventing aggregation and oxidation thereof. Moreover, the nanoparticles can be safely transported after drying the hydrogel. The incorporation of silver within the hydrogel introduces synergistic effects and specific selectivity, thereby enhancing its applicability across various fields. The nanoparticles exhibit diverse properties, including antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal, and antidiabetic effects. Additionally, they serve as efficient photocatalysts for dye degradation in aqueous solutions.</dc:description>

The hybrid material, which contains an approximate weight percentage of 9% silver, was characterized using various techniques, including scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. Remarkably, and in contrast to the initial hydrogel, the hybrid material was found to be stable at temperatures exceeding 100 &#176;C. This material offers a practical means for preserving silver nanoparticles by preventing aggregation and oxidation thereof. Moreover, the nanoparticles can be safely transported after drying the hydrogel. The incorporation of silver within the hydrogel introduces synergistic effects and specific selectivity, thereby enhancing its applicability across various fields. The nanoparticles exhibit diverse properties, including antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal, and antidiabetic effects. Additionally, they serve as efficient photocatalysts for dye degradation in aqueous solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Effective Strategies in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen as a significant green energy source, has emerged as one of the most promising candidates to solve serious environmental and energy problems. Photocatalytic water splitting is a prospective route to sustainable hydrogen production. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are considered as efficient photocatalysts due to their substantial specific surface areas, extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbones, and robust chemical stability. This review summarizes the recent advances of COF&#8208;based materials in the field of photocatalytic hydrogen production, including the construction of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) structure, protonation of the N site, synthesis of zwitterionic COFs, introduction of co&#8208;catalysts, use of metal&#8208;containing monomers, and compositing COFs with other catalysts. The properties of the catalysts are meticulously adjusted through those structural and system design strategies, thereby significantly enhancing the hydrogen production performance of the COFs. Finally, the challenges and potential opportunities for future developments are discussed in terms of the current research status and practical applications of photocatalytic hydrogen production from COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Embedding high&#8208;density ionic sites in porous aromatic frameworks via multivariate strategy for ReO4&#8208; capture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The radioactive waste discharge from nuclear facilities has attracted extensive attention on effective capture from used nuclear fuel. Herein, to address these issues, three porous aromatic frameworks with high&#8208;density ionic sites were successfully synthesized through a multivariate strategy. These MTV&#8208;iPAFs are named PAF&#8208;271, PAF&#8208;272 and PAF&#8208;273, respectively, and used for ultrafast and selective removal of ReO4&#8722;. Because these materials have varying high specific surface areas, porosities, and imidazolium densities. The results demonstrated that compared to PAF&#8208;272 with low adsorption site density and PAF&#8208;273 with high specific surface area, PAF&#8208;271 with higher imidazolium density exhibited superior performance for ReO4&#8208; adsorption. PAF&#8208;271 could remove 98% of ReO4&#8208; within 2 min, and the maximum adsorption capacity was 707 mg g&#8208;1. Moreover, PAF&#8208;271 also had excellent stability, making it highly effective for ReO4&#8208; adsorption under strong acid or alkali, radiation, high anion concentration and even in Hanford simulated waste liquid. Embedding high&#8208;density ionic sites within PAFs by multivariate strategy result in highly stable and effective radioactive waste disposal approach.</dc:description>

         <title>Azine Dearomatization in Natural Product Total Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The utilization of feedstock azine starting materials in the total synthesis of alkaloid natural products has had a storied history that has resulted in some of the most efficient syntheses to date. The use of aromatic building blocks not only has economic value, but implicit synthetic advantages towards concise synthesis and accessing broader molecular diversity.







Abstract
Since antiquity, alkaloid natural products have served as medicinal ingredients that still contribute as an inspiration for the development of novel therapeutics. For the synthetic chemist, much of the importance of natural products lies in their acting as a forcing&#8208;function for the invention of new synthetic strategies and tactics for molecular assembly. With this rich history in mind, it remains an important goal for chemists to build nitrogenous structures with greater efficiency, abiding by economies of synthesis. Nitrogenous aromatic feedstocks have been an intriguing starting point for the functionalization and construction of alkaloids for several decades, but recent advances in reaction design have opened new doors for leveraging their abundance in concise synthesis. Herein, advances in this area of synthetic ingenuity will be summarized with the aim of instructing chemists towards considering dearomatization as a strategic avenue for both target&#8208;oriented and diversity&#8208;oriented synthetic campaigns. Overall, syntheses are evaluated, compared, and contrasted to give a systematic overview of this continued area of research.

         <title>Technetium and Rhenium Auto&#8208;reduction, Polymerization and Lability towards Group VII Polyoxometalate Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pertechnetate and perrhenate auto&#8208;reduce, leading to coordination geometries suitable for polyoxometalate (POM) assembly. Evaporation of pertechnic acid leads to the prior&#8208;reported [Tc4O4(H2O)2(TcO4)14]4&#8722;. Evaporation of perrhenic acid yields (ReVI,oct)2(ReVII,tet)2(OH)2(O)12&#8901;H2O, the first evidence for Re auto&#8208;reduction, prior known for the lighter group VII congeners. Combined perrhenate and pertechnetate yield the [Tc4O4(H2O)2(ReO4)14]2&#8722; polyanion, the first group VII mixed&#8208;metal POM.







Abstract
Group VII Tc and Re have long been studied to develop both radiopharmaceuticals and technologies for nuclear materials management. Fundamental research has targeted understanding this periodic table crossroads where polyoxometalates meets metal&#8208;metal bonded complexes. Here we have isolated green hygroscopic and metastable crystals of (ReVI,oct)2(ReVII,tet)2(OH)2(O)12&#8901;H2O (ReVI,VII&#8208;green, tet=tetrahedral, oct=octahedral), determined by single&#8208;crystal x&#8208;ray diffraction. In addition to color, Re&#8208;L1 X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge spectroscopy confirms the reduced oxidation state. ReVI,VII&#8208;green provides the first demonstration of Re autoreduction, long&#8208;observed for Mn and Tc. We also isolated and structurally characterized [Tc4O4(H2O)2(ReO4)14]2&#8722; (Tc4Re14) polyanion crystals that contain Tc(V) and Re(VII), consistent with greater stability of reduced Tc compared to reduced Re. Small angle X&#8208;ray scattering of both compounds and prior&#8208;reported polyanion [Tc4O4(H2O)2(TcO4)14]4&#8722; (Tc20) dissolved in acetonitrile indicated a qualitative lability order of oxo&#8208;linkages of Re&#8208;O&#8722;Re &gt; Re&#8208;O&#8722;Tc &gt;Tc&#8208;O&#8722;Tc, and lability of Tc20 was also probed by 99Tc nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Computation provided insight into 99Tc chemical shifts as well as lability. Based on both reducibility and solution phase dynamics of polynuclear compounds investigated here, Re is an imperfect surrogate for Tc, and further expansion of group VII polyoxometalate chemistry seems promising.

         <title>Convenient Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;Acyl Glycosides and its Application in the Synthesis of Scleropentaside A, Scleropentaside B and the Derivatives of Dapagliflozin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient synthetic strategy for constructing &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;acyl glycosides is developed through nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive coupling and isomerization, which is subsequently applied in the total synthesis of the natural products scleropentaside A and scleropentaside B. Additionally, &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;acyl glucosides and their derivatives demonstrate significant SGLT2 inhibitory activity, making them potential candidates for diabetes treatment.







Abstract
C&#8208;Glycosides are a common feature in numerous bioactive natural compounds and play a crucial role as mimics of O/N&#8208;glycosides. Our process for synthesizing &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;acyl glycosides involves a reductive cross&#8208;coupling of protected glycosyl bromides with the corresponding carboxylic acid, followed by base&#8208;assisted deprotection and isomerization. This method is compatible with diverse glycosyl donors, including disaccharides. Consequently, we achieved the total synthesis of the natural products scleropentaside A and scleropentaside B with exceptional efficiency. These &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;acyl glycosides can be readily transformed into novel forms of C&#8208;glycosides capable of disrupting signaling pathways linked to various pathological conditions, such as diabetes.

&lt;p&gt;An efficient synthetic strategy for constructing &#946;-&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-acyl glycosides is developed through nickel-catalyzed reductive coupling and isomerization, which is subsequently applied in the total synthesis of the natural products scleropentaside A and scleropentaside B.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Backboned Polymers: A New Concept for Thermoelectric Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MBPs, with a unique backbone entirely composed of bonded metal atoms, offer promising quantum confinement that enhances electrical conductivity while reducing thermal conductivity. This Concept highlights their potential for the advanced thermoelectric materials, with recent progress, challenges, and future directions discussed.







Abstract
Thermoelectric materials, capable of directly converting heat into electricity, offer significant potential for advancing renewable energy solutions. However, conventional thermoelectric materials, typically based on bulky structures, are constrained by the thermoelectric transport paradox. Metal&#8208;backboned polymers, emerging as one&#8208;dimensional materials designed at the single atom level, offer quantum confinement that enhances electrical conductivity while reducing thermal conductivity, potentially overcoming the above limitations. Herein, we explore the potential of metal&#8208;backboned polymers for the development of highly efficient thermoelectric materials, including their synthesis, structural advantages, potential applications and recent advancements. Moreover, current challenges and promising directions for further advancing their performance and applicability in eco&#8208;friendly energy technologies are also discussed.

         <title>Formal Umpolung Strategy for the Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Branched Amides via &#945;&#8208;Sulfenylnitro Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient umpolung strategy for synthesizing &#945;&#8208;branched amides using nitroalkenes, Grignard reagents, and amines has been developed. This strategy utilizes only readily available reagents. Key advances include the one&#8208;pot synthesis of &#945;&#8208;sulfenylnitroalkanes, optimized oxidative amidation, and a demonstration of a wide substrate scope. In addition, the sulfenylnitro scaffold offers notable advantages in terms of reactivity and stability.







Abstract
Amide compounds are essential structural motifs found in natural products, pharmaceuticals, peptides and materials. A novel formal umpolung strategy for an efficient synthesis of &#945;&#8208;branched amides was developed, employing nitroalkenes, Grignard reagents and amines as reacting components. The synthesis involves the formation of &#945;&#8208;sulfenylnitro intermediates, which undergo oxidative amidation under optimized conditions using tert&#8208;butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as an oxidant and K2CO3 as a base. The key intermediate, an &#945;&#8208;sulfenylnitro compound, was successfully synthesized in a one&#8208;pot operation. This methodology demonstrates a broad substrate scope, accommodating various amines, including primary and secondary amines as well as amino acid derivatives, and yielding the corresponding &#945;&#8208;branched amides in high efficiency. The sulfenyl nitro scaffold proved particularly effective, offering both stability and reactivity. The developed process simplifies the preparation of &#945;&#8208;branched amides and expands the accessible structural diversity.

         <title>Asymmetric Catalytic Aziridination to Synthesize Spiro&#8208;aziridine Oxindoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported an efficient asymmetric catalytic aza&#8208;Michael&#8208;initiated ring closure of methyleneindolinones with N&#8208;tosyloxycarbamates for the construction of spiro&#8208;aziridine oxindoles. A readily available chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/Ni(OTf)2 complex catalyst was identified to afford the corresponding products in good yields with high ee values. The stereospecific ring&#8208;opening of spiro&#8208;aziridine oxindoles enable the formation of glycinate&#8208;substituted oxindole derivatives.







Abstract
Asymmetric catalytic aza&#8208;Michael&#8208;initiated ring closure of methyleneindolinones with N&#8208;tosyloxycarbamates has been established. The reaction using a chiral nickel complex catalyst enabled the formation of a series of spiro&#8208;aziridine oxindoles in good yields (up to 99&#8201;%) with high stereoselectivity (up to 97&#8201;% ee, &gt;19&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr) under mild reaction conditions. Ring&#8208;opening of spiro&#8208;aziridine oxindole leads to formation of glycinate&#8208;bearing oxindoles with retention of configuration.
