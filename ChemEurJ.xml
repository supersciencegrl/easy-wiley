      <title>Modular Synthesis of trans&#8208;A2B2&#8208;Porphyrins with Terminal Esters &#8211; Systematically Extending the Scope of Linear Linkers for Porphyrin&#8208;Based MOFs</title>
      <dc:description>Differently functionalized porphyrin linkers represent the key compounds for the syntheses of new porphyrin&#8208;based MOFs, which have gathered great interest within the last two decades. Herein we report the synthesis of a large range of 5,15&#8208;bis(4&#8208;ethoxycarbonylphenyl)porphyrin derivatives, through Suzuki and Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reactions of an easily accessible corresponding  meso  &#8208;dibrominated  trans  &#8208;A  2  B  2  &#8208;porphyrin with commercially available boronic acids or terminal alkynes. The resulting porphyrins were fully characterized through NMR, MS, and IR spectroscopy and systematically investigated through UV&#8208;Vis absorption. Finally, selected structures were saponified to the corresponding carboxylic acids and subsequently proven to be suitable for the synthesis of surface&#8208;anchored MOF thin films.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Differently functionalized porphyrin linkers represent the key compounds for the syntheses of new porphyrin&#8208;based MOFs, which have gathered great interest within the last two decades. Herein we report the synthesis of a large range of 5,15&#8208;bis(4&#8208;ethoxycarbonylphenyl)porphyrin derivatives, through Suzuki and Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reactions of an easily accessible corresponding  meso  &#8208;dibrominated  trans  &#8208;A  2  B  2  &#8208;porphyrin with commercially available boronic acids or terminal alkynes. The resulting porphyrins were fully characterized through NMR, MS, and IR spectroscopy and systematically investigated through UV&#8208;Vis absorption. Finally, selected structures were saponified to the corresponding carboxylic acids and subsequently proven to be suitable for the synthesis of surface&#8208;anchored MOF thin films.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Three&#8208;dimensional Cubic and Dice&#8208;like Microstructures of Higher Fullerene C78 with Enhanced Photoelectrochemical and Photoluminescence Properties</title>
      <dc:description>The single&#8208;crystal micro/nanostructures of fullerene species, namely C  60  and C  70  , have been previously studied, but studies on the morphology and properties of higher fullerenes have rarely been reported due to the limited amount of samples and their ellipsoidal isomeric structures. Herein, we report the formation of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) micro&#8208;cubes and micro&#8208;dice of a higher fullerene (C  78  ) via a facile liquid&#8208;liquid interfacial precipitation (LLIP) method. The micro&#8208;cubes were prepared by regulating the concentration of C  78  in trimethylbenzene (TMB) and the volume ratio of TMB and isopropanol. A simple handshaking process transformed the micro&#8208;cubes into micro&#8208;dice with an open&#8208;hole on each crystal face. X&#8208;ray diffraction and Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopic studies revealed a simple cubic unit cell with a lattice constant of 10.6 &#197; and intercalated TMB molecules in both crystals. The C  78  cubic and dice&#8208;like microstructures exhibited enhanced photoelectrochemical and photoluminescence properties compared with pristine C  78  powder, indicating their potential applications as photodetectors and photoelectric devices.</dc:description>

      <title>Hierarchical carbon nanowires/Ni@MnO2 nanocomposites for high&#8208;performance asymmetric supercapacitors</title>
      <dc:description>In this work, a rational 3D hierarchical carbon cloth/nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanowires/Ni@MnO  2  (CC/N&#8208;CNWs/Ni@MnO  2  ) nanocomposite electrode is successfully designed and prepared by electrodeposition. The   N&#8208;C nanowire  s derived from polypyrrole (PPy) nanowires on the carbon cloth possess open framework structure, which greatly increases the contact area between the electrode and electrolyte and provides short diffusion paths. The incorporation of the Ni layer between the N&#8208;CNWs and MnO  2  is beneficial for significantly enhancing the electrical conductivity and boosting the fast charge transfer as well as improving the charge&#8208;collection capacity. Thus, the as&#8208;prepared 3D hierarchical CC/N&#8208;CNWs/Ni@MnO  2  electrode exhibits a higher specific capacitance of 571.4 F g  &#8208;1  compared with those of CC/N&#8208;CNWs@MnO  2  (311  F g  &#8208;1  ), CC/Ni@MnO  2  (196.6 F g  &#8208;1  ) and CC@MnO  2  (186.1 F g  &#8208;1  ) at 1 A g  &#8208;1  and remarkable rate capability (367.5 F g  &#8208;1  at 10 A g  &#8208;1  ). Moreover, the asymmetric supercapacitors constructed using CC/N&#8208;CNWs/Ni@MnO  2  as a cathode material and activated carbon (AC) as an anode material deliver an impressive energy density of 36.4 Wh kg  &#8208;1  at the power density of 900 W kg  &#8208;1  and a good cycling life (72.8% capacitance retention after 3500 cycles). This study paves a low&#8208;cost and simple way to design a hierarchical nanocomposite electrode with large surface area and superior electrical conductivity, which holds a wide application prospect in high&#8208;performance supercapacitors.</dc:description>

      <title>From Distinct Metallopeptoids to Self&#8208;Assembled Supramolecular Architectures</title>
      <dc:description>The construction of synthetic protein mimics is a central goal in chemistry, that can be addressed by the self&#8208;assembly of synthetic biomimetic sequences into supramolecular structures. Obtaining different 3D structures via a simple sequence modification, however, is still challenging. Herein we present the design and synthesis of biomimetic architectures ,  via  the self&#8208;assembly of distinct copper&#8208;peptoid duplexes. We demonstrate that changing only one non&#8208;coordinating side&#8208;chain within peptoids &#8211; sequence&#8208;specific N&#8208;substituted glycine oligomers &#8211; leads to different supramolecular structures. Four peptoid trimers incorporating 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine and pyridine ligands, and a non&#8208;coordinating, but rather a structure&#8208;directed bulky group were synthesized, and their solutions were treated with Cu  2+  in a 1:1 ratio. Single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of the products revealed the self&#8208;assembly of each peptoid into a metallopeptoid duplex, followed by the self&#8208;assembly of multiple duplexes and their packing into a three&#8208;dimensional supramolecular architecture  via  hydrogen bonding and p &#8208; p interactions . Tuning the non&#8208;coordinating side&#8208;chain enables to regulate both the final structure being either a tightly packed helical rod or a nano&#8208;channel , and the pore width of the nano&#8208;channels. Importantly, all the metallopeptoids structures are stable in aqueous solution as verified by Cryo&#8208;TEM measurements and supported by UV&#8208;Vis and EPR spectroscopies and by ESI&#8208;MS analysis. Thus we could also demonstrate the selective recognition abilities of the nano&#8208; channels towards glycerol.</dc:description>

      <title>May Trifluoromethylation and Polymerization of Styrene Occur from a Perfluorinated Persistent Radical (PPFR)?</title>
      <dc:description>The radical polymerization of styrene (St) initiated by a trifluoromethyl radical generated from a perfluorinated highly branched persistent radical (PPFR) is presented with an isolated yield above 70%. The release of &#8226; CF3 radical occurred from temperature above 85 &#176;C. Deeper 1H and 19F nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies of the resulting fluorinated polystyrenes (CF3&#8208;PSts) evidenced the presence of both CF3 end&#8208;group of the PSt chain and the trifluoromethylation of the phenyl ring (in meta position mainly). [PPFR]0/[St]0 initial molar ratios of 3/1, 3/10 and 3/100 led to various molar masses ranging from 1750 to 5400 g.mol&#8208;1 in 70&#8208;86% yields. MALDI&#8208;TOF spectrometry of such CF3&#8208;PSts highlighted polymeric distributions which evidenced differences between m/z fragments of 104 and 172 corresponding to styrene and trifluoromethyl styrene units, respectively. Such CF3&#8208;PSt polymers were also compared to conventional PSts produced from the radical polymerization of St initiated by a peroxydicarbonate initiator. A mechanism of the polymerization is presented showing the formation of a trifluoromethyl styrene first, followed by its radical (co)polymerization with styrene. The thermal properties (thermal stability and glass transition temperature, Tg) of these polymers were also compared and revealed a much better thermal stability of the CF3&#8208;PSt (10% weight loss at 356&#8208;376 &#176;C) and a Tg of around 70 &#176;C.</dc:description>

      <title>Supramolecular Paradigm for Capture and Co&#8208;Precipitation of Gold(III) Coordination Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>A new supramolecular paradigm is presented for reliable capture and co&#8208;precipitation of haloauric acids (HAuX  4  ) from organic solvents or water. Two classes of acyclic organic compounds act as complementary receptors (tectons) by forming two sets of directional non&#8208;covalent interactions, (a) hydrogen bonding between amide (or amidinium) NH residues and the electronegative X ligands on the AuX  4  &#8208;  , and (b) electrostatic stacking of the electron deficient Au center against the face of an aromatic surface. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of four co&#8208;crystal structures reveals the additional common feature of proton bridged carbonyls as a new and predictable supramolecular design element that creates one&#8208;dimensional polymers linked by very short hydrogen bonds (CO&#183;&#183;&#183;OC distance &lt; 2.5 &#197;).

      <title>Strain&#8208;Induced Nucleophilic Ring Opening of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropenes for Synthesis of Monosubstituted Succinic Acid Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>1,2,3&#8208;Trisubstituted donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropenes (DACPs) generated  in situ  from enoldiazo compounds react with nucleophiles to form &#945;&#8208;substituted succinic acid derivatives in high yields. Initial dirhodium(II) carboxylate catalysis rapidly converts enoldiazo&#8208;acetates or &#8208;acetamides to DACPs that undergo catalyst&#8208;free Favorskii ring opening with amines, and also with anilines, alcohols, and thiols, when facilitated by catalytic amounts of DMAP.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;1,2,3&#8208;Trisubstituted donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropenes (DACPs) generated  in situ  from enoldiazo compounds react with nucleophiles to form &#945;&#8208;substituted succinic acid derivatives in high yields. Initial dirhodium(II) carboxylate catalysis rapidly converts enoldiazo&#8208;acetates or &#8208;acetamides to DACPs that undergo catalyst&#8208;free Favorskii ring opening with amines, and also with anilines, alcohols, and thiols, when facilitated by catalytic amounts of DMAP.

      <title>Photochemical Functionalization of Heterocycles with EBX Reagents; C&#8208;H Alkynylation versus Deconstructive Ring Cleavage</title>
      <dc:description>The development of novel methodologies for the functionalization of saturated heterocycles is highly desirable. Herein, we report a cheap and efficient photochemical method for the C&#8208;H functionalization of saturated  O  &#8208;heterocycles, as well as the deconstructive ring&#8208;cleavage of  S  &#8208;heterocycles, employing hypervalent iodine alkynylation reagents (Ethynylbenziodoxolones, EBX). This photochemical alkynylation is performed utilizing phenylglyoxylic acid as the photoinitiator, leading to the corresponding products in good to high yields, under household fluorescent light bulb irradiation. When  O  &#8208;heterocycles were employed, the expected &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;H alkynylation took place. In contrast, oxidative ring&#8208;opening to form a thioalkyne and an aldehyde was observed with  S  &#8208;heterocycles. Preliminary mechanistic experiments are presented to give first insights into this puzzling divergent reactivity.</dc:description>

      <title>Surface engineering strategy using urea to improve the rate performance of Na2Ti3O7 in Na&#8208;ion batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Na2Ti3O7 (NTO) is considered a promising anode material for Na&#8208;ion batteries due to its layered structure with an open framework and low and safe average operating voltage of 0.3 V vs. Na+/Na. However, its poor electronic conductivity needs to be addressed to make this material attractive for practical applications among other anode choices. Here, we report a safe, controllable and affordable method using urea that significantly improves the rate performance of NTO by producing surface defects (e.g. oxygen vacancies and hydroxyl groups) and the secondary phase Na2Ti6O13. A comprehensive study using a combination of diffraction, microscopic, spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques supported by computational studies based on DTF calculations, was carried out to understand the effects of this treatment on the surface, chemistry and electronic and charge storage properties of NTO. This study underscores the benefits of using urea as a strategy for enhancing the charge storage properties of NTO and thus, unfolding the potential of this material in practical energy storage applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Methylene Bridging Effect on the Structures, Lewis Acidities and Optical Properties of Semi&#8208;Planar Triarylboranes</title>
      <dc:description>Two straightforward synthetic methods towards semi&#8208;planar triarylboranes with two aryl rings connected by a methylene bridge have been developed.

      <title>Electron&#8208;Deficient Conjugated Materials via p&#8208;pi* Conjugation with Boron: Extending Monomers to Oligomers, Macrocycles, and Polymers</title>
      <dc:description>Among conjugated hybrid materials, tricoordinate boranes are attracting ever increasing attention because the empty p&#8208;orbital on boron not only provides for significant Lewis acidity, but interactions with neighbouring pi&#8208;electron systems produce unique optical and electronic properties. In this review, we systematically discuss the development of pi&#8208;extended organoboranes from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. A key question is how the electronic structure of organoboranes changes upon extension from molecules to oligomers, macrocycles, and polymers. An analysis of the p&#8208;pi* conjugation, and of mutual interactions between electron&#8208;deficient boron centers across p &#8208;conjugated linkers, allows for important structure&#8208;property relationships to be deduced.

      <title>Divergent Synthesis of Bioactive Dithiodiketopiperazine Natural Products Based on a Double C(sp3)&#8211;H Activation Strategy</title>
      <dc:description>This article provides a detailed report of our efforts to synthesize the dithiodiketopiperazine (DTP) natural products (&#8211;)&#8208;epicoccin G and (&#8211;)&#8208;rostratin A using a double C(sp  3  )&#8211;H activation strategy. The strategy&#8217;s viability was first established on a model system lacking the C8/C8&#8217; alcohols. Then, an efficient stereoselective route including an organocatalytic epoxidation was secured to access a key bis&#8208;triflate substrate. This bis&#8208;triflate served as the functional handles for the key transformation of the synthesis: a double C(sp  3  )&#8211;H activation. The successful double activation opened access to a common intermediate for both natural products in high overall yield and on a multigram scale. After several unsuccessful attempts, this intermediate was efficiently converted to (&#8211;)&#8208;epicoccin G and to the more challenging (&#8211;)&#8208;rostratin A via suitable oxidation/reduction and protecting group sequences, and via a final sulfuration that occurred in good yield and high diastereoselectivity. These efforts culminated in the synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;epicoccin G and (&#8211;)&#8208;rostratin A in high overall yields (19.6% over 14 steps and 12.7% over 17 steps, respectively), with the latter being obtained on a 500 mg scale. Toxicity assessments of these natural products and several analogues (including the newly synthesized epicoccin K) in the leukemia cell line K562 confirmed the importance of the disulfide bridge for activity and identified dianhydrorostratin A as a 20x more potent analogue.</dc:description>

We previously reported findings on 3 lead compounds derived from oxamniquine (OXA), an old antischistosomal drug: ferrocene&#8208;containing (Fc&#8208;CH  2  &#8208;OXA), ruthenocene&#8208;containing (Rc&#8208;CH  2  &#8208;OXA) and benzene&#8208;containing (Ph&#8208;CH  2  &#8208;OXA) OXA derivatives. These derivatives showed excellent  in vitro  activity against both  Schistosoma mansoni  larvae and adult worms and  S. haematobium  adult worms, and  in vivo  activity against  S. mansoni  . Encouraged by these promising results, we conducted additional in&#8208;depth preclinical studies and report in this investigation on metabolic stability studies,  in vivo  studies on  S. haematobium  and juvenile  S. mansoni  , computational simulations, and formulation development. Molecular dynamics simulations supported the  in vitro  results on the target protein. Though all three compounds were poorly stable within an acidic environment, they were only slightly cleared in the  in vitro  liver model. This is likely the reason as to why the promising  in vitro  activity did not translate to  in vivo  activity on  S. haematobium  . This limitation could not be saved by the formulation of lipid nanocapsules as an intent to improve the  in vivo  activity. Further studies should focus on increasing the compound&#8217;s bioavailability, in order to reach an active concentration in the parasite&#8217;s microenvironment.</dc:description>

      <title>Solid&#8208;state properties of hexaazatriphenylenehexacarbonitrile HAT(CN)6&#183;&#8722; radical anions in crystalline salts containing cryptand(M+) and crystal violet cations.</title>

      <title>Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 at Coinage Metal Nanodendrites in Aqueous Ethanolamine</title>
      <dc:description>Electrocatalytic reduction of CO  2  into usable chemicals is a promising path to address climate change and energy challenges. Herein, we demonstrate to synthesize of unique coinage metal (Cu, Ag and Au) nanodendrites (NDs) via a facile galvanic replacement reaction (GRR) process as the effective electrocatalysts for the reduction of CO  2  in the ethanolamine (EA) solution. Each metal ND surface was directly grown on glassy carbon (GC) substrates from the mixture of Zn dust and the respective precursor solution. The electrocatalytic activities of the synthesized ND surfaces&#160; were optimized for CO  2  reduction in the EA solution by varying their composition. It was determined that a 0.05 mole fraction of EA exhibited the highest catalytic activity for all of the metal NDs. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques showed that metal NDs electrodes possessed higher current densities, low onset potentials and low charge&#8208;transfer resistances for CO  2  reduction as compared to their smooth polycrystalline electrode counterparts, indicating improved&#160; CO  2  reduction catalytic activity.. It was determined, using FTIR and NMR spectroscopy, that formate was produced as a result of the CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

      <title>Phosphorescent trinuclear Pt&#8208;Ir&#8208;Pt complexes: Insight into photophysical, electrochemical properties and interaction with guanine nucleobase</title>
      <dc:description>In this work, we focus on the comparative photophysical and electrochemical properties of two isomeric heterotrinuclear platinum(II)&#8208;iridium(III)&#8208;platinum(II) complexes (3, 6) and&#160; four intermediate isomeric homonuclear cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes (1 &#8208; 2, 4 &#8208; 5). The isomerisation originates from the positional change of aldehyde moiety, CH  2  &#8208;di&#8208;2&#8208;picolylamine and Pt&#8208;di&#8208;2&#8208;picolylamine unit that remain appended at cyclometalated or ancillary ligand end. The interaction with 5&#8242;&#8208;GMP with trinuclear complexes 3 and 6 shows that platinum centres appended with cyclometalated ligand in 3 facilitates the binding of two 5&#8242;&#8208;GMP unit/Pt(II) centre in preference to single unit/Pt(II) centre in 6. The 1:2 vs. 1:1 (Pt(II):5&#8217;&#8208;GMP) binding is probably due to the convenient disposal of Pt&#8208;di&#8208;2&#8208;picolylamine unit towards different planes in 3.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis and optimization of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks for oxygen evolution reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks/Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (MOFs/ZIFs) and their post&#8208;synthesis modified nanostructures, such as oxides, hydroxides and carbons have generated significant interest for electrocatalytic reactions. In this work, we report a high and durable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance from bimetallic Zn100&#8208;xCox&#8208;ZIF samples directly, without carrying out high&#8208;temperature calcination and/or carbonization. ZIFs can be reproducibly and readily synthesized in large scale at ambient conditions. The bimetallic ZIFs show a systematic and gradually improved OER activity with increasing cobalt concentration. A further increase in OER activity is evidenced in ZIF&#8208;67 polyhedrons with controlled particle size of &lt;200 nm among samples of different sizes between 50 nm and 2 &#181;m. Building on this, a significantly enhanced, &gt;50%, OER activity is obtained in ZIF&#8208;67/carbon black, which shows a low&#8208;overpotential of ~320 mV in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. Such activity is comparable or better to numerous MOFs/ZIFs derived electrocatalysts. The optimized ZIF&#8208;67 sample also exhibits increased activity and durability over 24 h, which is attributed to in&#8208;situ developed active cobalt&#8208;oxide/oxyhydroxide related nanophase.</dc:description>

      <title>High Energy Proton Beam&#8208;Induced Polymerization/Oxygenation of Hydroxynaphthalenes on Meteorites and Nitrogen Transfer from Urea: Modeling Insoluble Organic Matter?</title>
      <dc:description>Formation and structural modification of oxygenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (oxyPAHs) by UV irradiation on minerals have recently been proposed as a possible channel of PAH transformation in astrochemical and prebiotic scenarios of possible relevance for the origin of life. Herein, we demonstrate that high energy proton beam irradiation in the presence of various meteorites, including stony iron, achondrite, and chondrite type, promotes the conversion of two representative oxyPAH compounds, 1&#8208;naphthol (1&#8208;HN) and 1,8&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene (1,8&#8208;DHN), into complex mixtures of oxygenated and oligomeric derivatives. Main identified products include polyhydroxy derivatives, isomeric dimers encompassing benzofuran and benzopyran scaffolds, and, notably, a range of quinones and perylene derivatives. Addition of urea, a prebiotically&#8208;relevant chemical precursor, expanded the range of identified species to include, among others, quinone diimines. Proton beam irradiation of oxyPAH, as modulated by nitrogen containing compound like urea, is proposed as a possible contributory mechanism for the formation and processing of insoluble organic matter (IOM) in meteorites and in prebiotic processes</dc:description>

      <title>Allosteric control of naphthalene diimide encapsulation and electron transfer in porphyrin containers: photophysical studies and molecular dynamics simulation</title>
      <dc:description>The complexation processes of N,N&#8217;&#8208;dibutyl&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalene diimide (NDI) into two types of &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;rich molecular containers consisting of two Zn(II)&#8208;porphyrins connected by four flexible linkers of two different lengths, were characterized by means of absorption and emission spectroscopies and molecular dynamics simulation. Noteworthy, the addition of NDI leads to a strong quenching of the fluorescence of both cages only when they are in an open conformation suitable for guest encapsulation, a situation triggered by silver(I) ions binding to the lateral triazoles. Molecular dynamics simulations confirm the fast binding of NDI, likely assisted by NDI&#8208;silver(I) interactions. Upon NDI complexation, the two porphyrin macrocycles get closer, with an optimized face to face orientation, suggesting an induced&#8208;fit mechanism through &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions with the NDI aromatic cycle. Ultrafast transient absorption experiments allowed to identify the process of quenching of the Zn&#8208;porphyrin fluorescence as an efficient photoinduced electron transfer reaction between the cage porphyrin and the included NDI guest. The process occurs on fast and ultrafast time scales in the two complexes (1.5 ps and &#8804; 300 fs) leading to a short&#8208;lived charge separated state (charge recombination lifetimes in the order of 30&#8208;40 ps). The combined computational and experimental approach used here is able to furnish a reliable model of the NDI&#8208;cage complexation mechanism and of the corresponding electron transfer reaction, attesting the allosteric control of both processes by the silver(I) ions.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
Electroactive organic molecules exhibiting electrical conductivity, redox&#8208;activity, optical or magnetic properties have emerged in recent years as promising building blocks for the design of crystalline porous frameworks, such as metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs), with numerous functions in electronics. In this Review, the main electroactive organic building blocks used in the past few years for the design and construction of functional porous materials for application in electronics are summarized with special emphasis on their electronic structure and function relationships.

      <dc:description>
C&#8722;H activation has emerged as one of the most efficient tools for the formation of carbon&#8211;carbon and carbon&#8211;heteroatom bonds, avoiding the use of prefunctionalized materials. However, stoichiometric quantities of toxic and/or costly chemical redox reagents are largely required for oxidative C&#8722;H activations. Recently, electrosynthesis has experienced a remarkable renaissance, enabling the use of storable, safe and waste&#8208;free electric current as a redox equivalent. Nickela&#8208;electrocatalyzed C&#8722;H activations avoid substrate prefunctionalizations and chemical oxidants by electricity. For more details see the Minireview by L.

      <dc:description>
Silver is a well&#8208;known antimicrobial and with the emergence of multiresistant bacteria it has come back into the focus of research; ionic as well as nano&#8208;sized silver have been studied in vitro and in vivo. The results are controversial, silver being discussed as the &#8220;silver bullet&#8221; or a &#8220;wolf in sheep's clothing&#8221;. This Review aims to give insight into the activity and mechanism of silver in biological media, be it in contact with bacteria or cells. For more details see the Review by K.&#8197;M. Fromm et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;10948&#8197;ff.

      <dc:description>
Photoactivatable carbon&#8208;monoxide&#8208;releasing molecules (photoCORMs) are currently being intensively explored as therapeutically relevant pro&#8208;drugs because this approach may lead to a safe and controllable release of carbon monoxide. In this context, a green&#8208;fluorescent ruthenium(II) complex was designed as carrier for carbon monoxide and as molecular probe for monitoring the uptake in cells. Irradiation with UV&#8208;A light triggered the desired decarbonylation with a rather unexpected outcome. For more details see the Full Paper by H. Stephan, M.

      <title>Enhanced Macroanion Recognition of Superchaotropic Keggin Clusters Achieved by Synergy of Anion&#8208;&#960; Interaction and Anion&#8208;Cation Interaction</title>
      <dc:description>Keggin clusters are the most widely used polyoxomatales building blocks for construction advanced materials, while effective methods of precisely recognizing the isostructural analogues of Keggins are still limited. Here we applied zwitterionic molecule 4,4'&#8208;dipyridyl&#8208;N,N'&#8208;dioxide (dpdo) as a recognition receptor to specifically bind with the three Keggin analogues, PW12O403&#8208;, PMo12O403&#8208; and SiW12O404&#8208;, which co&#8208;assembled into three groups of spherical charged colloids with different sizes, separately. The recognition phenomena were further confirmed by electrochemistry study and crystallization behaviors. Compared with sole anion&#8208;cation interaction driven systems, the synergism from anion&#8208;&#960; adsorption between the superchaotropic Keggins and the electro&#8208;deficient pyridine rings is believed to enhance the recognition phenomenon. The observation is intriguing as the long&#8208;range solution assembly of Keggins is mainly driven by the short&#8208;range anion&#8208;&#960; interaction. Our results show that the little&#8208;noticed hydration shell of Keggins was significantly influenced by the superchaotropic effect, leading to differentiated binding affinity to the receptors and more obvious recognition phenomena between W/Mo Keggin analogues.</dc:description>

      <title>Controlling the number of branches and surface facets of Pd&#8208;core Ru&#8208;branched nanoparticles to make highly active oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalysts</title>
      <dc:description>Producing stable but active materials is one of the enduring challenges in electrocatalysis and other types of catalysis. Producing branched nanoparticles is one potential solution. Controlling the number of branches and branch size of faceted branched nanoparticles is one of the major synthetic challenges to achieve highly active and stable nanocatalysts. Herein, we use cubic&#8208;core hexagonal&#8208;branch mechanism to synthesize branched Ru nanoparticles with control over the size and number of branches.

      <dc:description>Thirteen N&#8208;butylpyridinium salts, including three monometallic [C4Py]2[MCl4], nine bimetallic [C4Py]2[M1&#8208;xaMxbCl4] and one trimetallic compound [C4Py]2[M1&#8208;y&#8208;zaMybMzcCl4] (M = Co, Cu, Mn; x = 0.25, 0.50 or 0.75 and y = z = 0.33), were synthesized and their structure and thermal and electrochemical properties were studied. All compounds are ionic liquids (ILs) with melting points between 69 and 93&#176;C. X&#8208;ray diffraction proves that all ILs are isostructural. The conductivity at room temperature is between 10&#8208;4 and 10&#8208;8 S cm&#8208;1. Some Cu&#8208;based ILs reach conductivities of 10&#8208;2 S cm&#8208;1, which is, however, probably due to IL dec. This correlates with the optical band&#8208;gap measurements indicating the formation of large band gap semiconductors. At elevated temperatures approaching the melting points, the conductivities reach up to 1.47 &#8729; 10&#8208;1 S cm&#8208;1 at 70 &#186;C. The electrochemical stability windows of the ILs are between 2.5 and 3.0 V.</dc:description>

      <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional NiIr@N&#8208;Doped Carbon Nanocomposites Supported on Ni Foam for Electrocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
      <dc:description>Electrochemical water splitting can provide a promising avenue for sustainable hydrogen production. Highly efficient electrocatalysts toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are extremely important for the practical application of water splitting technology. Here we report a one&#8208;step annealing strategy for the fabrication of a metal&#8208;organic framework&#8208;derived bifunctional self&#8208;supported electrocatalyst, which is composed of two&#8208;dimensional N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;wrapped Ir&#8208;doped Ni nanoparticle composites supported on Ni foam (NiIr@N&#8208;C/NF). The resultant NiIr@N&#8208;C/NF displays excellent electrocatalytic performance in 1.0 M KOH, with low overpotentials of 32 mV at 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  for HER and 329 mV at 50 mA cm  &#8208;2  for OER. Particularly, the HER&#8208;OER bifunctional NiIr@N&#8208;C/NF needs only 1.50 V to yield 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  for overall water splitting.</dc:description>

      <title>Conversion from Heterometallic to Homometallic Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>

Two new heterometallic metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), LnZnTPO, and two homometallic MOFs, LnTPO (Ln=Eu or Tb; H3TPO=tris(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)phosphine oxide) were synthesized, and their structures and properties were analyzed.

Abstract
Two new heterometallic metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), LnZnTPO 1 and 2, and two homometallic MOFs, LnTPO 3 and 4 (Ln=Eu for 1 and 3, and Tb for 2 and 4; H3TPO=tris(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)phosphine oxide) were synthesized, and their structures and properties were analyzed. They were prepared by solvothermal reaction of the C3&#8208;symmetric ligand H3TPO with the corresponding metal ion(s) (a mixture of Ln3+ and Zn2+ for 1 and 2, and Ln3+ alone for 3 and 4). Single&#8208;crystal XRD (SXRD) analysis revealed that 1 and 3 are isostructural to 2 and 4, respectively. TGA showed that the framework is thermally stable up to about 400&#8201;&#176;C for 1 and 2, and about 450&#8201;&#176;C for 3 and 4. PXRD analysis showed their pore&#8208;structure distortions without noticeable framework&#8211;structure changes during drying processes. The shapes of gas sorption isotherms for 1 and 3 are almost identical to those for 2 and 4, respectively. Solvothermal immersion of 1 and 2 in Tb3+ and Eu3+ solutions resulted in the framework metal&#8208;ion exchange affording 4 and 3, respectively, as confirmed by photoluminescence (PL), PXRD, IR, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP&#8208;AES), and energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray (EDX) analyses.

      <title>Explaining Cu@Pt Bimetallic Nanoparticles Activity Based on NO Adsorption</title>
      <dc:description>
Explaining enhanced stability: Cu@Pt nanoparticles (NPs) are experimentally regarded as improved catalysts for NOx storage/reduction, with higher activities and selectivities compared with pure Pt or Cu NPs, and inverse Pt@Cu NPs.

Abstract
Cu@Pt nanoparticles (NPs) are experimentally regarded as improved catalysts for NOx storage/reduction, with higher activities and selectivities compared with pure Pt or Cu NPs, and with inverse Pt@Cu NPs. Here, a density functional theory&#8208;based study on such NP models with different sizes and shapes reveals that the observed enhanced stability of Cu@Pt compared with Pt@Cu NPs is due to energetic reasons. On both types of core@shell NPs, charge is transferred from Cu to Pt, strengthening the NP cohesion energy in Pt@Cu NPs, and spreading charge along the surface in Cu@Pt NPs. The negative surface Pt atoms in the latter diminish the NO bonding owing to an energetic rise of the Pt bands, as detected by the appliance of the d&#8208;band model, although other factors, such as atomic low coordination or the presence of an immediate subsurface Pt atom do as well. A charge density difference analysis discloses a donation/back&#8208;donation mechanism in the NO adsorption.

&lt;p&gt;Cu@Pt nanoparticles (NPs) are experimentally regarded as improved catalysts for NO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; storage/reduction, with higher activities and selectivities compared with pure Pt or Cu NPs, and with inverse Pt@Cu NPs. Here, a density functional theory&#8208;based study on such NP models with different sizes and shapes reveals that the observed enhanced stability of Cu@Pt compared with Pt@Cu NPs is due to energetic reasons. On both types of core@shell NPs, charge is transferred from Cu to Pt, strengthening the NP cohesion energy in Pt@Cu NPs, and spreading charge along the surface in Cu@Pt NPs. The negative surface Pt atoms in the latter diminish the NO bonding owing to an energetic rise of the Pt bands, as detected by the appliance of the &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;band model, although other factors, such as atomic low coordination or the presence of an immediate subsurface Pt atom do as well. A charge density difference analysis discloses a donation/back&#8208;donation mechanism in the NO adsorption.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sequence Decoding of 1D to 2D Self&#8208;Assembling Cyclic Peptides</title>
      <dc:description>The inherent ability of peptides to self&#8208;assemble with directional and rationally predictable interactions has fostered a plethora of synthetic two&#8208;dimensional (2D) supramolecular biomaterials. However, the design of peptides with hierarchical assembly in different dimensions across mesoscopic lengths remains a challenging task. We here describe the structural exploration of a D/L&#8208;alternating cyclic octapeptide capable of assembling one&#8208;dimensional (1D) nanotubes in water, which subsequently pack laterally to form giant 2D nanosheets up to 500 &#181;m long with a constant 3.2 nm thickness. Specific amino acid mutations allowed the mapping of structure&#8208;assembly relationships that determine 2D self&#8208;assembly. Nine peptide modifications were studied, revealing key features in the peptide sequence that nanosheets tolerated, while a total of three peptide variants included modifications that compromised their 2D arrangement. These lessons will serve as guide and inspiration for new 2D supramolecular peptide designs.</dc:description>

      <title>Supramolecular Chemistry of Titanium&#8208;oxide Clusters</title>
      <dc:description>Titanium&#8208;oxide clusters (TOCs) have been emerging as a new type of inorganic molecular entities of supramolecular chemistry. Here a perspective on the structures and the functionalities of TOCs over the past three decades is made and the paramount roles of TOCs in serving supramolecular chemistry are demonstrated. Four types of supramolecular assemblies based on TOCs are reviewed, including TOC hosts for ion inclusion, mechanically&#8208;interlocked molecular systems built from cyclic TOCs, reactivities of surface sites toward ligand exchange and hierachical structures of TOCs. The principles and advantages of TOCs toward each application are fully discussed along with the structural analysis. Following this path, more functional TOC&#8208;based supramolecular systems may be designed and synthesized in future, which in turn will certainly enhance the research on both supramolecular chemistry and coordination chemistry of titanium.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Herein, we report a photochemical reaction system which requires activation by two colors of light.

      <title>Ligand Selectivity by Inserting GCGC&#8208;tetrads Into G&#8208;quadruplex Structures</title>
      <dc:description>G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) assembled form tandem G&#8208;rich repeat sequences exhibit significant biological functions and applications, which may well depend on their structural features, such as the planar arrangement of G&#8208;tetrads and flexibility of loop regions. It has been found that cytosine&#8208;intercalated G&#8208;repeat sequences also assemble to be quadruplex structures, involving the formation of nonplanar GCGC&#8208;tetrads. Herein, to investigate the effect of GCGC&#8208;tetrads on structural properties of G4s, some previously studied quadruplexes with or without GCGC&#8208;tetrads were selected, and were used to interact with various developed G4 ligands. Our data show that stacked G&#8208;tetrads in quadruplexes are important for the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions, thus promoting the combination with end&#8208;stacking ligands, such as porphyrins or planar small molecules. This is confirmed by the fact that the quadruplex formed by d(GGGCT4GGGC) with two internal G&#8208;tetrads and two external GCGC&#8208;tetrads can bind to planar ligands in the presence of specific G4&#8208;stabilizing cations, including K+ and Pb2+, and can realize the sensitive detection of Pb2+. However, the quadruplex composed of two external G&#8208;tetrads and two internal GCGC&#8208;tetrads formed by d(GCGGT3GCGG) facilitates the binding of nonplanar ligands, such as triphenylmethane (TPM) dyes, owing to the structural flexibility induced by internal GCGC&#8208;tetrads. This work provides new insights into the interaction between DNA quadruplexes and specific ligands, which is beneficial to the development of quadruplex&#8208;based biosensors and the design of anticancer drugs.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
A novel labeled nucleotide exerts very low near&#8208;IR fluorescence in water but lights&#8208;up (up to a 348&#8208;fold increase) after polymerase incorporation to DNA. It can be used to directly visualize enzymatic DNA synthesis in vitro and the labeled DNA probes are also responsive to secondary structure changes or interactions with small molecules or proteins. Its application was demonstrated on real&#8208;time PCR detection of RNA from SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus. More information can be found in the Communication by M. Hocek et&#8197;al.

      <title>The synthesis and mechanistic considerations of a series of ammonium monosubstituted H&#8208;phosphonate salts</title>
      <dc:description>A series of ammonium monosubstituted  H  &#8208;phosphonate salts were synthesized by combining  H&#8208;  phosphonate diesters with amines in the absence of solvent at 80&#176;C.

For the diphenyl  H  &#8208;phosphonate diesters, (PhO)  2  P(O)H, the dearylation was found to proceed via phenol&#8208;assisted formation of a 5&#8208;coordinate intermediate, (PhO)  3  PH(OH), from which P(OPh)  3  and water were eliminated.

      <title>Direct observation of dynamic interactions between orientation&#8208;controlled nucleosomes in a DNA origami frame</title>
      <dc:description>The nucleosome is one of the most fundamental units involved in gene expression and consequent cell development, differentiation, and expression of cell functions. We report here a method to place reconstituted nucleosomes into a DNA origami frame for direct observation using high&#8208;speed atomic&#8208;force microscopy (HS&#8208;AFM). Using this method, multiple nucleosomes can be incorporated into a DNA origami frame and real&#8208;time movement of nucleosomes can be visualized. The arrangement and conformation of nucleosomes and the distance between two nucleosomes can be designed and controlled. In addition, four nucleosomes can be placed in a DNA frame. Multiple nucleosomes were well accessible in each conformation, and interactions were observed between them. Neither mica surface modification nor chemical fixation of nucleosomes is used in this method, meaning that the DNA frame not only holds nucleosomes, but also retains their natural state. This method offers a promising platform for investigating nucleosome interactions and studying chromatin structure.</dc:description>

      <title>Stimuli&#8208;sensitive self&#8208;assembled tubules based on lysine&#8208;derived surfactants for delivery of anti&#8208;microbial proteins</title>
      <dc:description>Drug delivery vectors based on amphiphiles have important features such as versatile physicochemical properties and stimuli&#8208;responsiveness. Amino acid&#8208;based surfactants are especially promising amphiphiles due to their enhanced biocompatibility compared to conventional surfactants. They can self&#8208;organize into micelles, vesicles and complex hierarchical structures, such as fibers, twisted and coiled ribbons, and tubules. In this work, we investigated the self&#8208;assembly and drug loading properties of a family of novel anionic double&#8208;tailed lysine&#8208;derived surfactants, with variable degree of tail length mismatch, designated as  m  Lys10 and 10Lys  n  , where  m  and  n  are the carbon atoms in the tails. These surfactants form tubular aggregates with assorted morphologies in water that undergo gelation due to dense entanglement, as evidenced by light and electron microscopy. Lysozyme (LZM), an enzyme with antimicrobial properties, was selected as model protein for loading. After the characterization of the interfacial properties and phase behavior of the amphiphiles, the LZM&#8208;loading ability of the tubules was investigated, under varying experimental conditions, to assess the efficiency of the aggregates as pH&#8208; and temperature&#8208;sensitive nanocarriers. Further, the toxicological profile of the surfactants  per se  and surfactant/LZM hydrogels was obtained, using human skin fibroblasts (BJ&#8208;5ta cell line). Overall, the results show that the tubule&#8208;based hydrogels exhibit very interesting properties for the transport and controlled release of molecules of therapeutic interest.</dc:description>

      <title>Photochemistry in real space: batho&#8208; and hypsochromism in the water dimer</title>
      <dc:description>The development of chemical intuition in photochemistry faces several difficulties which result from the inadequacy of the one&#8208;particle picture, the Born&#8208;Oppenheimer approximation, and other basic notions used to build models. We show herein how real space approaches can be efficiently used to get valuables insights in photochemistry via a simple example of red and blue shift effects: the double hypso&#8208; and bathochromic shift in the low&#8208;lying valence excited states of (H2O) 2 . We demonstrate that (i) the use of these techniques allows to maintain the perturbative language used in the theory of intermolecular interactions even in the strongly interacting short&#8208;range regime; (ii) that it is one and only one molecule that gets photoexcited in each of the addressed excited states and (iii) that the electrostatic interaction

between the in&#8208;the&#8208;cluster molecular dipoles provides a fairly intuitive rationalization of the observed batho&#8208; and hypsochromism. The methods exploited and illustrated in this paper are able to maintain the individuality as well as the properties of the interacting entities in a molecular aggregate, and thereby they allow to keep and build chemical intuition in general states, at any geometry and using a broad variety of electronic structure methods.</dc:description>

      <title>Photophysical Properties and Heterogeneous Photoredox Catalytic Activities of Ru(bpy)3@InBTB MOF</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with negatively charged frameworks are suitable for selectively encapsulating cationic guest ions via a cation&#8208;exchange process. Encapsulating photoactive [RuL3]2+ polypyridine complexes into the preorganized mesoscale channels of an MOF is a good method for stabilizing the excited states of the complexes. Three new RuL3@InBTB MOFs were prepared by encapsulating cationic [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (bpy = 2,2'&#8208;bipyridine), [Ru(phen)3]2+ (phen = 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline), and [Ru(bpz)3]2+ (bpz = 2,2'&#8208;bipyrazine) into the mesopores of a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) InBTB MOF (H3BTB = 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetribenzoic acid). The photophysical properties of the resulting materials were investigated by photoluminescence (PL) analysis. The photoredox catalytic activities were also investigated for the aza&#8208;Henry reaction, hydrogenation of dimethyl maleate, and decomposition of methyl orange under visible light irradiation at room temperature. RuL3@InBTB MOFs were found to be very stable and highly recyclable photoredox catalytic systems.</dc:description>

      <title>In situ Mass Spectrometric and Kinetic Investigations of Soai's Asymmetric Autocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Chemical reactions that lead to a spontaneous symmetry breaking or amplification of the enantiomeric excess are of fundamental interest in explaining the formation of a homochiral world. An outstanding example is Soai&#8217;s asymmetric autocatalysis, in which small enantiomeric excesses of the added product alcohol are amplified in the reaction of diisopropylzinc and pyrimidine&#8208;5&#8208;carbaldehydes. The exact mechanism is still in dispute due to complex reaction equilibria and elusive intermediates. In situ high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometric measurements, detailed kinetic analyses and doping with in situ reacting reaction mixtures, show the transient formation of hemiacetal complexes, which can establish an autocatalytic cycle. We propose a mechanism that explains the autocatalytic amplification involving these hemiacetal complexes. Comprehensive kinetic experiments and modelling of the hemiacetal formation and the Soai reaction allow the precise prediction of the reaction progress, the enantiomeric excess as well as the enantiomeric excess dependent time shift in the induction period. Experimental structural data give insights into the privileged properties of the pyrimidyl units and the formation of diastereomeric structures leading to an efficient amplification of even minimal enantiomeric excesses, respectively.</dc:description>

      <title>Cubane, Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane and Bicyclo[2.2.2]octane: Impact and Thermal Sensitiveness of Carboxyl&#8208;, Hydroxymethyl&#8208; and Iodo&#8208;substituents</title>
      <dc:description>
Fire and bicy: The thermal and impact sensitiveness of a series of carboxy&#8208;, hydroxymethyl&#8208;, and iodo&#8208;substituted cages were examined through sealed cell differential scanning calorimetry and hammer impact tests. The results reveal that these often&#8208;popular synthetic intermediates and functional groups can present some safety issues if not handled, stored, or used with care.







Abstract
With the burgeoning interest in cage motifs for bioactive molecule discovery, and the recent disclosure of 1,4&#8208;cubane&#8208;dicarboxylic acid impact sensitivity, more research into the safety profiles of cage scaffolds is required. Therefore, the impact sensitivity and thermal decomposition behavior of judiciously selected starting materials and synthetic intermediates of cubane, bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP), and bicyclo[2.2.2]octane (BCO) were evaluated via hammer test and sealed cell differential scanning calorimetry, respectively. Iodo&#8208;substituted systems were found to be more impact sensitive, whereas hydroxymethyl substitution led to more rapid thermodecomposition. Cubane was more likely to be impact sensitive with these substituents, followed by BCP, whereas all BCOs were unresponsive. The majority of derivatives were placed substantially above Yoshida thresholds&#8212;a computational indicator of sensitivity.

      <title>Generating Excess Protons in Microsolvated Acid Clusters under Ambient Conditions: An Issue of Configurational Entropy versus Internal Energy</title>
      <dc:description>
Temperature dependent: Extensive ab initio path integral simulations disclose that the number of water molecules required to allow for acid dissociation, and thus for the generation of hydrated excess protons, in restricted aqueous environments such as finite HCl(H2O)n clusters, is temperature dependent.







Abstract
Acid dissociation, and thus liberation of excess protons in small water droplets, impacts on diverse fields such as interstellar, atmospheric or environmental chemistry. At cryogenic temperatures below 1&#8197;K, it is now well established that as few as four water molecules suffice to dissociate the generic strong acid HCl, yet temperature&#8208;driven recombination sets in simply upon heating that cluster. Here, the fundamental question is posed of how many more water molecules are required to stabilize a hydrated excess proton at room temperature. Ab initio path integral simulations disclose that not five, but six water molecules are needed at 300&#8197;K to allow for HCl dissociation independently from nuclear quantum effects. In order to provide the molecular underpinnings of these observations, the classical and quantum free energy profiles were decomposed along the dissociation coordinate in terms of the corresponding internal energy and entropy profiles. What decides in the end about acid dissociation, and thus ion pair formation, in a specific microsolvated water cluster at room temperature is found to be a fierce competition between classical configurational entropy and internal energy, where the former stabilizes the undissociated state whereas the latter favors dissociation. It is expected that these are generic findings with broad implications on acid&#8211;base chemistry depending on temperature in small water assemblies.

      <title>A Mechanistic Study of the Multiple Roles of Oleic Acid in the Oil&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Pt Nanocrystals</title>
      <dc:description>Oleic acid (OAc) is commonly used as a surfactant and/or solvent for the oil&#8208;phase synthesis of metal nanocrystals but its explicit roles are yet to be resolved. Here we report a systematic study of this problem by focusing on a synthesis that simply involves heating of Pt(acac)  2  in OAc for the generation of Pt nanocrystals. When heated at 80  o  C, the ligand exchange between Pt(acac)  2  and OAc leads to the formation of a Pt  II  &#8211;oleate complex that serves as the actual precursor to Pt atoms. Upon increasing the temperature to 120  o  C, the decarbonylation of OAc produces CO, which can act as a reducing agent for the generation of Pt atoms and thus formation of nuclei. Afterwards, several catalytic reactions can take place on the surface of the Pt nuclei to produce more CO, which also serves as a capping agent for the formation of Pt nanocrystals enclosed by {100} facets. The emergence of Pt nanocrystals further promotes the autocatalytic surface reduction of Pt  II  precursor to enable the continuation of growth. This work not only elucidates the critical roles of OAc at different stages in a synthesis of Pt nanocrystals but also represents a pivotal step forward toward the rational synthesis of metal nanocrystals.</dc:description>

      <title>Metalloporphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework on flexible carbon paper for electrocatalytic nitrite oxidation</title>
      <dc:description>Deposition of redox&#8208;active MOFs as thin films on conductive substrates is of great importance to improve their electrochemical performance and durability. In this work, a series of metalloporphyrinic MOF crystals was successfully deposited as thin films on carbon fiber paper (CFP) substrate, which is an alternative to the rigid glass substrates.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deposition of redox&#8208;active MOFs as thin films on conductive substrates is of great importance to improve their electrochemical performance and durability.

      <title>A Chatt&#8208;type Catalyst&#160;with One Coordination Site&#160;for Dinitrogen Reduction to Ammonia</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract: With [Mo(N2)(P2MePP2Ph)] the first Chatt&#8208;type complex with one coordination site catalytically converting N2 to ammonia is presented. Employing SmI2 as reductant and H2O as proton source 26 equivalents of ammonia are generated. Analogous Mo(0)&#8208;N2 complexes supported by a combination of bi&#8208; and tridentate phosphine ligands are catalytically inactive under the same conditions. These findings are interpreted by analyzing structural and spectroscopic features of the employed systems, leading to the conclusion that the catalytic activity of the title complex is due to the strong activation of N2 and the unique topology of the pentadentate tetrapodal (pentaPod) ligand P2MePP2Ph. The analogous hydrazido(2&#8208;) complex [Mo(NNH2)(P2MePP2Ph)](BArF)2 is generated by protonation with HBArF in ether and characterized by NMR and vibrational spectroscopy. Importantly, it is shown to be catalytically active as well. Along with the fact that the structure of the title complex precludes dimerization this demonstrates that the corresponding catalytic cycle follows a mononuclear pathway. The implications of a PCET mechanism on this reactive scheme are considered.</dc:description>

      <title>Structure&#8208;Guided Design of Formate Dehydrogenase for Regeneration of a Non&#8208;Natural Redox Cofactor</title>
      <dc:description>Formate dehydrogenase (FDH) has been widely used for the regeneration of the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). To utilize nicotinamide cytosine dinucleotide (NCD) as a non&#8208;natural redox cofactor, it remains challenging as NCDH, the reduced form of NCD, has to be efficiently regenerated. Here we demonstrate successful engineering of FDH for NCDH regeneration. Guided by the structural information of FDH from Pseudomonas sp. 101 (pseFDH) and the NAD&#8208;pseFDH complex, semi&#8208;rational strategies were applied to design mutant libraries and screen for NCD&#8208;linked activity. The most active mutant reached a cofactor preference switch from NAD to NCD by 3700&#8208;fold. Homology modeling analysis showed that these mutants had reduced cofactor binding pockets and dedicated hydrophobic interactions for NCD. Efficient regeneration of NCDH was implemented by powering an NCD&#8208;dependent D&#8208;lactate dehydrogenase for stoichiometric and stereospecific reduction of pyruvate to D&#8208;lactate at the expense of formate.</dc:description>

More information can be found in the Full Paper by L. Ackermann, S.&#8197;B. Tsogoeva, et&#8197;al. (DOI: &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.20200180310.1002/chem.202001803&lt;/a&gt;).

      <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Resorcin[4]arene Cavitands: Toward Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Activated Molecular Grippers</title>
      <dc:description>
Resorcin[4]arene cavitands can be switched between a kite conformation, adopted in the dark, and a vase conformation, generated under visible light irradiation. The switching is triggered by the formation of a semiquinone radical anion through a photosensitizing process. The large conformational rearrangement of the cavitands resembles the mechanical switching occurring in some flowers that bloom open in the evening and close during the day (cover design: Ella Maru Studio). More information can be found in the Full Paper by V. Garc&#237;a&#8208;L&#243;pez, F.&#8197;Diederich, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202001788).

      <title>Borate Hydrides as a New Material Class: Structure, Computational Studies, and Spectroscopic Investigations on Sr5(BO3)3H and Sr5(11BO3)3D</title>
      <dc:description>
New anion combination: Borate hydride Sr5(BO3)3H and deuteride Sr5(11BO3)3D were prepared and studied using a number of characterization methods, including 1H solid&#8208;state MAS NMR and vibrational spectroscopy together with quantum chemical calculations as well as X&#8208;ray and neutron powder diffraction. Doped with Eu2+, broad&#8208;band orange&#8208;red emission under violet excitation can be observed, highlighting the potential of the compound class as host material for optical applications.
