         <title>Synthesis and Structure of an o&#8208;Carboranyl&#8208;Substituted Three&#8208;Coordinate Borane Radical Anion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stabilization via three&#8208;coordinate boron allows the isolation of a paramagnetic radical anion of ortho&#8208;carborane. A photophysical, electrochemical and crystallographic study backed by DFT calculations shines light on closo&#8208;nido intermediate structures, charge transfer processes and electron accepting ability.







Abstract
Bis(1&#8208;(4&#8208;tolyl)&#8208;carboran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;(4&#8208;tolyl)&#8208;borane [(1&#8208;(4&#8208;MeC6H4)&#8208;closo&#8208;1,2&#8208;C2B10H10&#8208;2&#8208;)2(4&#8208;MeC6H4)B] (1), a new bis(o&#8208;carboranyl)&#8208;(R)&#8208;borane was synthesised by lithiation of the o&#8208;carboranyl precursor and subsequent salt metathesis reaction with (4&#8208;tolyl)BBr2. Cyclic voltammetry experiments on 1 show multiple distinct reduction events with a one&#8208;electron first reduction. In a selective reduction experiment the corresponding paramagnetic radical anion 1.&#8722; was isolated and characterized. Single&#8208;crystal structure analyses allow an in&#8208;depth comparison of 1, 1.&#8722;, their calculated geometries, and the S1 excited state of 1. Photophysical studies of 1 show a charge transfer (CT) emission with low quantum yield in solution but a strong increase in the solid state. TD&#8208;DFT calculations were used to identify transition&#8208;relevant orbitals.

         <title>d/f&#8208;Polypnictides Derived by Non&#8208;Classical Ln2+ Compounds: Synthesis, Small Molecule Activation and Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Six new d/f&#8208;polyphosphides or d/f&#8208;polyarsenides, [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)] [Cp&#8242;&#8242;2Ln(E5)FeCp*] (Ln=La, Ce, Nd; E=P, As), were obtained by usage of non&#8208;classical divalent lanthanide compounds as reducing agents. While their optical properties were investigated by fs&#8208;spectroscopy, their reactivity was studied by P4 activation. The latter resulted in a selective expansion of the P5 rings ([K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)] [Cp&#8242;&#8242;2Ln(P7)FeCp*] (Ln=La, Nd)).







Abstract
Reduction chemistry induced by divalent lanthanides has been primarily focused on samarium so far. In light of the rich physical properties of the lanthanides, this limitation to one element is a drawback. Since molecular divalent compounds of almost all lanthanides have been available for some time, we used one known and two new non&#8208;classical reducing agents of the early lanthanides to establish a sophisticated reduction chemistry. As a result, six new d/f&#8208;polyphosphides or d/f&#8208;polyarsenides, [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)] [Cp&#8242;&#8242;2Ln(E5)FeCp*] (Ln=La, Ce, Nd; E=P, As) were obtained. Their reactivity was studied by activation of P4, resulting in a selective expansion of the P5 rings. The obtained compounds [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)] [Cp&#8242;&#8242;2Ln(P7)FeCp*] (Ln=La, Nd) are the first examples of an activation of P4 by a f&#8208;element&#8208;polypnictide complex. Additionally, the first systematic femtosecond (fs)&#8208;spectroscopy investigations of d/f&#8208;polypnictides are presented to showcase the advantages of having access to a broader series of lanthanide compounds.

         <title>A Novel M8L6 Cubic Cage That Binds Tetrapyridyl Porphyrins: Cage and Solvent Effects in Cobalt&#8208;Porphyrin&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclopropanation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design, synthesis, and application of a novel caged cobalt porphyrin catalyst is reported. The effects of the solvent and/or the cage on the catalytic performance in cobalt&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation reactions were investigated for the free and confined catalyst. Encapsulation of the catalyst led to a three times more active catalyst compared to the well&#8208;established cobalt&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin and leads to a substantially increased TON.







Abstract
Confinement of a catalyst can have a significant impact on catalytic performance and can lead to otherwise difficult to achieve catalyst properties. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a novel caged catalyst system Co&#8722;G@Fe8(Zn&#8722;L&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;1)6, which is soluble in both polar and apolar solvents without the necessity of any post&#8208;functionalization. This is a rare example of a metal&#8208;coordination cage able to bind catalytically active porphyrins that is soluble in solvents spanning a wide variety of polarity. This system was used to investigate the combined effects of the solvent and the cage on the catalytic performance in the cobalt catalyzed cyclopropanation of styrene, which involves radical intermediates. Kinetic studies show that DMF has a protective influence on the catalyst, slowing down deactivation of both [Co(TPP)] and Co&#8722;G@Fe8(Zn&#8722;L&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;1)6, leading to higher TONs in this solvent. Moreover, DFT studies on the [Co(TPP)] catalyst show that the rate determining energy barrier of this radical&#8208;type transformation is not influenced by the coordination of DMF. As such, the increased TONs obtained experimentally stem from the stabilizing effect of DMF and are not due to an intrinsic higher activity caused by axial ligand binding to the cobalt center ([Co(TPP)(L)]). Remarkably, encapsulation of Co&#8722;G led to a three times more active catalyst than [Co(TPP)] (TOFini) and a substantially increased TON compared to both [Co(TPP)] and free Co&#8722;G. The increased local concentration of the substrates in the hydrophobic cage compared to the bulk explains the observed higher catalytic activities.

         <title>Reductive Rearrangement of a 1&#8208;Phospha&#8208;2&#8208;azanorbornene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1&#8208;Phospha&#8208;2&#8208;azanorbornenes (PAN) are shown to be suitable starting materials for novel bridged 7&#8208;membered phosphorus heterocycles (using lithium aluminium hydride as reducing agent) or lithium phospholide (with elemental lithium as reducing agent). Artwork by Dr. Christoph Selg.







Abstract
The reduction of the 1&#8208;phospha&#8208;2&#8208;azanorbornene derivate endo&#8208;1 with lithium aluminium hydride leads to an unprecedented 1&#8208;phosphabicyclo[3.2.1]octa&#8208;2,5&#8208;diene, while a phospholide anion is formed with lithium. The latter can be protonated resulting in formation of an unusual 2H&#8208;phosphole dimer.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1&#8208;Phospha&#8208;2&#8208;azanorbornenes&lt;/b&gt; (PAN) are shown to be suitable starting materials for novel bridged 7&#8208;membered phosphorus heterocycles (using lithium aluminium hydride as reducing agent) or lithium phospholide (with elemental lithium as reducing agent).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reduction of the 1&#8208;phospha&#8208;2&#8208;azanorbornene derivate &lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; with lithium aluminium hydride leads to an unprecedented 1&#8208;phosphabicyclo[3.2.1]octa&#8208;2,5&#8208;diene, while a phospholide anion is formed with lithium. The latter can be protonated resulting in formation of an unusual 2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;phosphole dimer. Furthermore, 3&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;phospholes, previously assumed to have no synthetic relevance as intermediates, were proposed to act as dienophile in the dimerisation of 3,4&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1&#8208;phenylphosphole at elevated temperatures based on theoretical calculations.&lt;/p&gt;

         <dc:description>Owing to their highly designable and tunable features, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been extensively investigated and developed in a wide range of applications. However, due to their crystalline nature, poor manipulation and processability restrict their practical implementation. In this context, the development of membranous MOF&#8208;polymer hybrid materials is an effective approach to address these shortcomings. This minireview provides a systematic overview on the construction of MOF&#8208;polymer hybrid membranes and emphasizes their functions, including separation, ion conduction, and sensing, and points out a perspective on their future directions.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Fine Ligand Substitution Modification of the Isocyanidometal Bridge on Metal to Metal Charge Transfer Properties in Class II&#8208;III Mixed Valence Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and characterization of Class II&#8208;III mixed valence complexes have been an interesting topic due to their special intermediate behavior between localized and delocalized mixed valence complexes. To investigate the influence of the isocyanidometal bridge on metal to metal charge transfer (MMCT) properties, a family of new isocyanidometal&#8208;bridged complexes and their one&#8208;electron oxidation products cis&#8208;[Cp(dppe)Fe&#8208;CN&#8208;Ru(L)2&#8208;NC&#8208;Fe(dppe)Cp][PF6]n  (n = 2, 3) (Cp = 1,3&#8208;cyclopentadiene, dppe = 1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane, L = 2,2'&#8208;bipyridine (bpy,  1[PF6]n), 5,5'&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2'&#8208;bipyridyl (5,5'&#8208;dmbpy,  2[PF6]n) and 4,4'&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2'&#8208;bipyridyl (4,4'&#8208;dmbpy,  3[PF6]n)) have been synthesized and fully characterized.&#160;The experimental results suggest that all the one&#8208;electron oxidation products may belong to Class II&#8208;III mixed valence complexes, supported by TDDFT calculations. With the change of the substituents of the bipyridyl ligand on the Ru center from H, 5,5'&#8208;dimethyl to 4,4'&#8208;dimethyl, the energy of MMCT for the one&#8208;electron oxidation complexes changes in the order:  13+  &lt;  23+  &lt;  33+  , and that for the two&#8208;electron oxidation complexes decreases in the order  14+  &gt;  34+  &gt;  24+  . The &#160;potential splitting (&#916;E1/2(2)) between the two terminal Fe centers for  N[PF6]2  are the largest potential splitting for the cyanido&#8208;bridged complexes reported so far. This work shows that the smaller potential difference between the bridging and the terminal metal centers would result in the more delocalized mixed valence complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Cs4B4O3F10: First Fluorooxoborate with [BF4] involving Heteroanionic Units and Extremely Low Melting Point</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, a new congruently melting mixed&#8208;anion compound Cs  4  B  4  O  3  F  10  has been characterized as the first fluorooxoborate with [BF  4  ] involving heteroanionic units. Cs  4  B  4  O  3  F  10  possesses two highly fluorinated anionic clusters and therefore its formula can be expressed as Cs  3  (B  3  O  3  F  6  )&#183;Cs(BF  4  ). The influence of [BF  4  ] units on micro&#8208;symmetry and structural evolution was discussed based on the parent compound. More importantly, Cs  4  B  4  O  3  F  10  shows the lowest melting point among all the available borates and thus sets a new record for such system. This work is of great significance to enrich and tailor the structure of borates using perfluorinated [BF  4  ] units.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Spirobiacridine&#8208;based Delayed Fluorescence Emitters for High&#8208;performance Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, researchers have focused on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) for efficient future lighting and displays. Among TADF emitters, a combination of triazine and acridine is a promising candidate for realizing high&#8208;efficiency organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs). However, simultaneous development of perfect horizontal orientation (&#920;  &#160;  = 100%) and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of over 40% is still challenging. Here, to obtain insights for further improvements of a triazine/acridine combination, we developed various asymmetric spirobiacridine (SBA)&#8208;based TADF emitters with a unity photoluminescence quantum yield and high &#920; ratio of over 80%. Furthermore, we studied the substitution effects of the triazine acceptor unit on the photophysical properties, including molecular orientations and OLED performance. The corresponding OLED exhibited sky&#8208;blue emission with a high EQE of over 30%.</dc:description>

         <title>Bio&#8208;inspired and Eco&#8208;friendly Synthesis of 3D Spongy Meso&#8208;Microporous Carbons from CO2 for Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by the spongy bone structures, three&#8208;dimensional (3D) sponge&#8208;like carbons with meso&#8208;microporous structures are synthesized through one&#8208;step electro&#8208;reduction of CO  2  in molten carbonate Li  2  CO  3  &#8208;Na  2  CO  3  &#8208;K  2  CO  3  at 580&#176;C. SPC4&#8208;0.5 (spongy porous carbon obtained by electrolysis of CO  2  at 4 A for 0.5 h) is synthesized with the current efficiency of 96.9%. SPC4&#8208;0.5 possesses large electrolyte ion accessible surface area, excellent wettability and electronical conductivity, ensuring the fast and effective mass and charge transfer, which make it an advcanced supercapacitor electrode material. SPC4&#8208;0.5 exhibits a specific capacitance as high as 373.7 F g  &#8208;1  at 0.5 A g  &#8208;1  , excellent cycling stability (retaining 95.9 % of the initial capacitance after 10000 cycles at 10 A g  &#8208;1  ), as well as high energy density. The applications of SPC4&#8208;0.5 in quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state symmetric supercapacitor and all&#8208;solid&#8208;state flexible devices for energy storage and wearable piezoelectric sensor are investigated.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the spongy bone structures, three&#8208;dimensional (3D) sponge&#8208;like carbons with meso&#8208;microporous structures are synthesized through one&#8208;step electro&#8208;reduction of CO  2  in molten carbonate Li  2  CO  3  &#8208;Na  2  CO  3  &#8208;K  2  CO  3  at 580&#176;C. SPC4&#8208;0.5 (spongy porous carbon obtained by electrolysis of CO  2  at 4 A for 0.5 h) is synthesized with the current efficiency of 96.9%. SPC4&#8208;0.5 possesses large electrolyte ion accessible surface area, excellent wettability and electronical conductivity, ensuring the fast and effective mass and charge transfer, which make it an advcanced supercapacitor electrode material. SPC4&#8208;0.5 exhibits a specific capacitance as high as 373.7 F g  &#8208;1  at 0.5 A g  &#8208;1  , excellent cycling stability (retaining 95.9 % of the initial capacitance after 10000 cycles at 10 A g  &#8208;1  ), as well as high energy density. The applications of SPC4&#8208;0.5 in quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state symmetric supercapacitor and all&#8208;solid&#8208;state flexible devices for energy storage and wearable piezoelectric sensor are investigated. Both devices show considerable capacitive performances. This work not only presents a controllable and facile synthetic route for the porous carbons but also provides a promising way for effective carbon reduction and green energy production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing highly active and sensitive peroxidase mimics for  L  &#8208;cysteine (  L  &#8208;Cys) colorimetric detection is very important for biotechnology and medical diagnosis. Herein, polyoxometalate&#8208;doped porous Co  3  O  4  composite (NiMo  6  @Co  3  O  4  ) was designed and prepared for the first time. Compared with pure and commercial Co  3  O  4  , NiMo  6  @Co  3  O  4  (n) composites exhibit the enhanced peroxidase&#8208;mimicking activities and stabilities due to the strong synergistic effect between porous Co  3  O  4  and multi&#8208;electron NiMo  6  clusters. Moreover, the peroxidase&#8208;mimicking activities of NiMo  6  @Co  3  O  4  (n) composites are heavily dependent on the doping mass of NiMo  6  , and the optimized NiMo  6  @Co  3  O  4  (2) exhibits the superlative peroxidase&#8208;mimicking activity. More importantly, a sensitive  L  &#8208;Cys colorimetric detection is developed with the sensitivity of 0.023 &#956;M  &#8208;1  and the detection limit at least 0.018 &#956;M in the linear range of 1&#8722;20 &#956;M, which is by far the best enzyme&#8208;mimetic performances, to the best our knowledge.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Organic Polysulfides from Disulfides via Sulfur Insertion from S8 and an Unexpected Solvent Effect on the Product Distribution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An electrochemical synthesis of organic polysulfides via sulfur insertion from elemental sulfur to disulfides or thiols was introduced. The highly economic, insensitive and low&#8208;priced reaction gives a mixture of polysulfides, whose distribution can be influenced by the addition of different amounts of carbon disulfide as co&#8208;solvent. To describe the variable distribution function of the polysulfides, a novel parameter, the &#8220;  absorbance average  s  ulfur  a  mount in  p  olysulfides&#8221; (SAP) was introduced and defined on the basis of the &#8220;number average molar mass&#8221; used in polymer chemistry. Various organic polysulfides were synthesized with variable volume fractions of carbon disulfide and the yield of each polysulfide was determined by quantitative  13  C NMR. Also, by using two symmetrical disulfides or a disulfide and a thiol as starting materials, a mixture of symmetrical and unsymmetrical polysulfides was obtained.</dc:description>

         <title>Endohedral Mixed Aggregates: Sodium Alkoxide Cages with Organic or Inorganic Central Anions and Variable Hull</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkali metal alkoxides are widely used in chemistry due to their Br&#248;nsted basic and nucleophilic properties. Potassium alkoxides assist alkyllithium in the metalation of hydrocarbons in Lochmann&#8208;Schlosser&#8208;bases. Both compounds form mixed aggregates, which enhance the thermal stability, solubility, and the basic reactivity of these mixtures. A very unusual spherical mixed alkoxy aggregate was discovered by Gr&#252;tzmacher et al., where a central dihydrogen phosphide anion is surrounded by a highly dynamic shell of thirteen sodium atoms and a hull of twelve tert &#8208;butoxide groups. This structural motif can be reproduced by a reaction of trimethylsilyl compounds of methane, halogens, or pseudo&#8208;halogens with excess sodium tert &#8208;butoxide. A nucleophilic substitution releases the corresponding anion, which is then encapsulated by the sodium alkoxide units. The compounds are soluble in hydrocarbon solvents, enabling studies of solutions by high resolution NMR spectroscopy and IR/Raman studies of the crystalline materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Nanosheets Stacked Hierarchical &#8220;Honey Stick&#8208;like&#8221; MFI Zeolite by Aromatic Heterocyclic Dual&#8208;functional Organic Structure&#8208;Directing Agent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Soft template designing is the most promised strategy for synthesis of zeolites nanosheets. So far, MFI nanosheets directed by soft templates (containing long chain alkyl groups or aromatic groups as hydrophobic component), can be found frequently. However, the MFI nanosheets synthesized by soft template with aromatic heterocycle groups (e.g. s&#8208;triazine groups) are rare. Herein, nanosheets stacked hierarchical MFI zeolite (NSHM) has been synthesized utilizing a triply branched s&#8208;triazine based surfactant as a bifunctional organic structure&#8208;directing agent. On the basis of geometrical match relationship, a formation model has been proposed. Synthesized NSHM was endowed with abundant mesopores stacked by nanosheets and exhibited a high surface area (430 m  2  &#8236;&#183;g  &#8208;1  ). The 1 wt% Pd/NSHM attained a significant increase in cyclohexanol/cyclohexanone mixture yield (from 66% to 85%) in oxidation of cyclohexane compared with Silicalite&#8208;1 and SBA&#8208;15 as supports.</dc:description>

         <title>Developing Bright GFP&#8208;Like Fluorogens for Live&#8208;Cell Imaging with Nonpolar Protein&#8208;Chromophore Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescence&#8208;activating proteins (FAPs) that bind a chromophore and activate its fluorescence have gained popularity in bioimaging. The fluorescence&#8208;activating and absorption&#8208;shifting tag (FAST) is a light&#8208;weight FAP that enables fast reversible fluorogen binding, thus advancing multiplex and super&#8208;resolution imaging. However, the rational design of FAST&#8208;specific fluorogens with large fluorescence enhancement (FE) remains challenging. Here, we report a novel fluorogen directly engineered from green fluorescent protein (GFP) chromophore by a unique double&#8208;donor&#8208;one&#8208;acceptor strategy, which exhibits an over 550&#8208;fold FE upon FAST binding and a high extinction coefficient of ~100,000 M  &#8722;1  &#183;cm  &#8722;1  . Correlation analysis of the excited state nonradiative decay rates and environmental factors reveal that the large FE is caused by nonpolar protein&#8208;fluorogen interactions. Our deep insights into structure&#8208;function relationships could guide the rational design of bright fluorogens for live&#8208;cell imaging with extended spectral properties such as redder emissions.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of two diazabisacenes is reported. A bisboronated naphthalene is Suzuki&#8208;coupled to substituted ethyl nicotinates, then cyclized  via  intramolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts acylation. The resulting diketones are alkynylated and reduced to give the title compounds, bis(TIPS&#8208;ethynyl) substituted naphtho[1,8&#8208;  gh  :5,4&#8208;  g  '  h  ']diquinoline and naphtho[1,8&#8208;  bc  :5,4&#8208;  b  '  c  ']diacridine. Nitrogen incorporation stabilizes the bisacenes with respect to oxidation compared to their consanguine nonaza&#8208;analogs.</dc:description>

The resulting diketones are alkynylated and reduced to give the title compounds, bis(TIPS&#8208;ethynyl) substituted naphtho[1,8&#8208;  gh  :5,4&#8208;  g  '  h  ']diquinoline and naphtho[1,8&#8208;  bc  :5,4&#8208;  b  '  c  ']diacridine. Nitrogen incorporation stabilizes the bisacenes with respect to oxidation compared to their consanguine nonaza&#8208;analogs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Azide&#8208;Functionalized Derivatives of the Virulence&#8208;Associated Sugar Pseudaminic Acid: Chiral Pool Synthesis and Labeling of Bacteria</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailor&#8208;made derivatives of pseudaminic acid (Pse) allow for the detection of Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria expressing this unique virulence&#8208;associated nonulosonic acid. The synthesis of azido&#8208;labeled Pse derivatives starting from d&#8208;glucose and respective labeling studies are described.







Abstract
Pseudaminic acid (Pse) is a significant prokaryotic monosaccharide found in important Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. This unique sugar serves as a component of cell&#8208;surface&#8208;associated glycans or glycoproteins and is associated with their virulence. We report the synthesis of azidoacetamido&#8208;functionalized Pse derivatives as part of a search for Pse&#8208;derived metabolic labeling reagents. The synthesis was initiated with d&#8208;glucose (Glc), which served as a cost&#8208;effective chiral pool starting material. Key synthetic steps involve the conversion of C1 of Glc into the terminal methyl group of Pse, and inverting deoxyaminations at C3 and C5 of Glc followed by backbone elongation with a three&#8208;carbon unit using the Barbier reaction. Metabolic labeling experiments revealed that, of the four Pse derivatives, ester&#8208;protected C5 azidoacetamido&#8208;Pse successfully labeled cells of Pse&#8208;expressing Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative strains. No labeling was observed in cells of non&#8208;Pse&#8208;expressing strains. The ester&#8208;protected and C5 azidoacetamido&#8208;functionalized Pse is thus a useful reagent for the identification of bacteria expressing this unique virulence&#8208;associated nonulosonic acid.

         <title>Photoinduced Electron vs. Concerted Proton Electron Transfer Pathways in SnIV (l&#8208;Tryptophanato)2 Porphyrin Conjugates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoinduced electron transfer (ET) or concerted proton&#8208;electron transfer (CPET) occur in tin(IV) porphyrin&#8208;tryptophan conjugates in dichloromethane in the presence of an organic base depending on the chromophore identity and spin multiplicity of the excited state which point out how peculiar the l&#8208;tryptophan amino acid is with respect to charge transfer reactions.







Abstract
Aromatic amino acids such as l&#8208;tyrosine and l&#8208;tryptophan are deployed in natural systems to mediate electron transfer (ET) reactions. While tyrosine oxidation is always coupled to deprotonation (proton&#8208;coupled electron&#8208;transfer, PCET), both ET&#8208;only and PCET pathways can occur in the case of the tryptophan residue. In the present work, two novel conjugates 1 and 2, based on a SnIV tetraphenylporphyrin and SnIV octaethylporphyrin, respectively, as the chromophore/electron acceptor and l&#8208;tryptophan as electron/proton donor, have been prepared and thoroughly characterized by a combination of different techniques including single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. The photophysical investigation of 1 and 2 in CH2Cl2 in the presence of pyrrolidine as a base shows that different quenching mechanisms are operating upon visible&#8208;light excitation of the porphyrin component, namely photoinduced electron transfer and concerted proton electron transfer (CPET), depending on the chromophore identity and spin multiplicity of the excited state. The results are compared with those previously described for metal&#8208;mediated analogues featuring SnIV porphyrin chromophores and l&#8208;tyrosine as the redox active amino acid and well illustrate the peculiar role of l&#8208;tryptophan with respect to PCET.

         <title>Imide Condensation as a Strategy for the Synthesis of Core&#8208;Diversified G&#8208;Quadruplex Ligands with Anticancer and Antiparasitic Activity**

The rigid rules of G&#8208;quadruplex stabilization: A library of amphiphiles has been synthesized in one step, using a simple imide condensation reaction. The G&#8208;quadruplex stabilization, anti&#8208;cancer and anti&#8208;parasitic activity of the library has been investigated, uncovering the important factors that govern G&#8208;quadruplex binding and selectivity, yielding a promising new core&#8208;motif and a compound with potent trypanosomacidal activity.







Abstract
A facile imide coupling strategy for the one&#8208;step preparation of G&#8208;quadruplex ligands with varied core chemistries is described. The G&#8208;quadruplex stabilization of a library of nine compounds was examined using FRET melting experiments, and CD, UV&#8208;Vis, fluorescence and NMR titrations, identifying several compounds that were capable of stabilizing G&#8208;quadruplex DNA with interesting selectivity profiles. The best G4 ligand was identified as compound 3, which was based on a perylene scaffold and exhibited 40&#8208;fold selectivity for a telomeric G&#8208;quadruplex over duplex DNA. Surprisingly, a tetra&#8208;substituted flexible core, compound 11, also exhibited selective stabilization of G4 DNA over duplex DNA. The anticancer and antiparasitic activity of the library was also examined, with the lead compound 3 exhibiting nanomolar inhibition of Trypanosoma brucei with 78&#8208;fold selectivity over MRC5 cells. The cellular localization of this compound was also studied via fluorescence microscopy. We found that uptake was time dependant, with localization outside the nucleus and kinetoplast that could be due to strong fluorescence quenching in the presence of small amounts of DNA.

         <title>Mechanistic and Kinetic Factors of ortho&#8208;Benzyne Formation in Hexadehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder (HDDA) Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview highlights the mechanism of ortho&#8208;aryne formation via hexadehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reactions, based on quantum chemical calculations, as well as kinetic, preparative and ultrafast spectroscopic experiments. The influence of the steric, electronic, and radical&#8208;stabilizing effects of substituents attached to diyne/diynophile pairs and linked yne&#8208;diynes provide crucial insight into the reaction mechanism.







Abstract
With the rapid development of the hexadehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction (HDDA) from its first discovery in 1997, the question of whether a concerted or stepwise mechanism better describes the thermally activated formation of ortho&#8208;benzyne from a diyne and a diynophile has been debated. Mechanistic and kinetic investigations were able to show that this is not a black or white situation, as minor changes can tip the balance. For that reason, especially, linked yne&#8208;diynes were studied to examine steric, electronic, and radical&#8208;stabilizing effects of their terminal substituents on the reaction mechanism and kinetics. Furthermore, the influence of the nature of the linker on the HDDA reaction was explored. The more recently discovered photochemical HDDA reaction also gives ortho&#8208;arynes, which display the same reactivity as the thermally generated ones, but their formation might not proceed by the same mechanism. This minireview summarizes the current state of mechanistic understanding of the HDDA reaction.

         <title>A Protecting&#8208;Group&#8208;Free Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Salvinorin A</title>

A divine sage: The potent KOR agonist (&#8722;)&#8208;salvinorin A was synthesized in only sixteen steps by modification of our previous route to the racemic title compound. Transition to asymmetric synthesis succeeded by a highly enantioselective propargylation to install the stereogenic center at C&#8208;12. Shortening of the original reaction sequence by two steps was finally achieved using a chemoselective Mitsunobu esterification of a cyclic syn 1,2&#8208;diol. Furthermore, an alternative intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder strategy employing a 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene moiety was investigated.







Abstract
A concise enantioselective total synthesis of the neoclerodane diterpene (&#8722;)&#8208;salvinorin A is reported. The stereogenic center at C&#8208;12 was installed by catalytic asymmetric propargylation with excellent enantioselectivity, and the remaining six stereogenic centers were set up highly diastereoselectively under substrate control. As for our previous synthesis of racemic salvinorin A, two intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder reactions were applied to generate the tricyclic core. A chemoselective Mitsunobu inversion of a syn 1,2&#8208;diol allowed for further streamlining of the original reaction sequence by two steps. Overall, (&#8722;)&#8208;salvinorin A was synthesized in only 16 steps starting from 3&#8208;furaldehyde with 1.4&#8201;% total yield. Furthermore, an alternative intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder strategy employing a 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene moiety was investigated.

         <title>Paramagnetic Solid&#8208;State NMR to Localize the Metal&#8208;Ion Cofactor in an Oligomeric DnaB Helicase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Paramagnetic solid&#8208;state NMR enables the positioning of the metal&#8208;ion co&#8208;factor in the ATP&#8208;fueled bacterial helicase DnaB from Helicobacter pylori. Diamagnetic Mg2+ is exchanged by paramagnetic Mn2+ and Co2+ leading to paramagnetic relaxation enhancements and pseudo&#8208;contact shifts in the NMR spectra. The Co2+ pseudo&#8208;contact shift surface reveals insights into DNA binding.







Abstract
Paramagnetic metal ions can be inserted into ATP&#8208;fueled motor proteins by exchanging the diamagnetic Mg2+ cofactor with Mn2+ or Co2+. Then, paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) or pseudo&#8208;contact shifts (PCSs) can be measured to report on the localization of the metal ion within the protein. We determine the metal position in the oligomeric bacterial DnaB helicase from Helicobacter pylori complexed with the transition&#8208;state ATP&#8208;analogue ADP:AlF4&#8722; and single&#8208;stranded DNA using solid&#8208;state NMR and a structure&#8208;calculation protocol employing CYANA. We discuss and compare the use of Mn2+ and Co2+ in localizing the ATP cofactor in large oligomeric protein assemblies. 31P PCSs induced in the Co2+&#8208;containing sample are then used to localize the DNA phosphate groups on the Co2+ PCS tensor surface enabling structural insights into DNA binding to the DnaB helicase.

         <title>Excited State Properties of Lanthanide(III) Complexes with a Nonadentate Bispidine Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
EuIII, TbIII, GdIII and YbIII complexes of a nonadentate bispidine derivative were successfully synthesized and their emission properties studied. The X&#8208;ray crystallography reveals full encapsulation by the nonadentate ligand, and the identical emission spectra in the solid state and in solution confirm equal structures in both media. As therefore expected, this results in long&#8208;lived excited states and high emission quantum yields, making these complexes a possible basis for interesting biological probes.







Abstract
EuIII, TbIII, GdIII and YbIII complexes of the nonadentate bispidine derivative L2 (bispidine=3,7&#8208;diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane) were successfully synthesized and their emission properties studied. The X&#8208;ray crystallography reveals full encapsulation by the nonadentate ligand L2 that enforces to all LnIII cations a common highly symmetrical capped square antiprismatic (CSAPR) coordination geometry (pseudo C4v symmetry). The well&#8208;resolved identical emission spectra in solid state and in solution confirm equal structures in both media. As therefore expected, this results in long&#8208;lived excited states and high emission quantum yields ([EuIIIL2]+, H2O, 298&#8197;K, &#964;=1.51&#8197;ms, &#966;=0.35; [TbIIIL2]+, H2O, 298&#8197;K, &#964;=1.95&#8197;ms, &#966;=0.68). Together with the very high kinetic and thermodynamic stabilities, these complexes are a possible basis for interesting biological probes.

Abstract
A new concept for the regioselective synthesis of [3&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;1] hexakis&#8208;adducts of fullerene C60 was developed. Based on sequential tether&#8208;directed remote functionalizations, chiral [3&#8201;:&#8201;2] pentakis&#8208;adducts with an incomplete octahedral addition pattern were synthesized via stepwise cyclopropanation of C60 with suitable macrocyclic tri&#8208; and bifunctional cyclomalonate tethers. The four resulting stereoisomers were isolated using chiral HPLC. The corresponding pairs of enantiomers show mirror image behavior in their CD&#8208;spectra. The pentakis&#8208;adducts served as suitable building blocks for the spatially controlled synthesis of mixed hexakis&#8208;adducts. Implementation of functional group&#8208;bearing monomalonates afforded octahedral [3&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;1] hexakis&#8208;adducts suitable for the construction of larger molecular and supramolecular fullerene architectures in excellent yield.

         <title>Cationic Aluminium Complexes as Catalysts for Imine Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>

Abstract
Strongly Lewis acidic cationic aluminium complexes, stabilized by &#946;&#8211;diketiminate (BDI) ligands and free of Lewis bases, have been prepared as their B(C6F5)4&#8722; salts and were investigated for catalytic activity in imine hydrogenation. The backbone (R1) and N (R2) substituents on the R1,R2BDI ligand (R1,R2BDI=HC[C(R1)N(R2)]2) influence sterics and Lewis acidity. Ligand bulk increases along the row Me,DIPPBDI&lt;Me,DIPePBDI&#8776;tBu,DIPPBDI&lt;tBu,DIPePBDI; DIPP=2,6&#8208;C(H)Me2&#8208;phenyl, DIPeP=2,6&#8208;C(H)Et2&#8208;phenyl. The Gutmann&#8208;Beckett test showed acceptor numbers of: (tBu,DIPPBDI)AlMe+ 85.6, (tBu,DIPePBDI)AlMe+ 85.9, (Me,DIPPBDI)AlMe+ 89.7, (Me,DIPePBDI)AlMe+ 90.8, (Me,DIPPBDI)AlH+ 95.3. Steric and electronic factors need to be balanced for catalytic activity in imine hydrogenation. Open, highly Lewis acidic, cations strongly coordinate imine rendering it inactive as a Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP). The bulkiest cations do not coordinate imine but its combination is also not an active catalyst. The cation (tBu,DIPPBDI)AlMe+ shows the best catalytic activity for various imines and is also an active catalyst for the Tishchenko reaction of benzaldehyde to benzylbenzoate. DFT calculations on the mechanism of imine hydrogenation catalysed by cationic Al complexes reveal two interconnected catalytic cycles operating in concert. Hydrogen is activated either by FLP reactivity of an Al&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;imine couple or, after formation of significant quantities of amine, by reaction with an Al&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;amine couple. The latter autocatalytic Al&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;amine cycle is energetically favoured.

         <title>Polythiolactone&#8208;Decorated Silica Particles: A Versatile Approach for Surface Functionalization, Catalysis and Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer&#8208;decorated precursor particles: Silica particles functionalized with polythiolactone polymer brushes are precursor particles for molecular surface functionalization, nanoparticle assemblies for catalysis, and polymer capsules for payload delivery applications.







Abstract
The surface chemistry of colloidal silica has tremendous effects on its properties and applications. Commonly the design of silica particles is based on their de novo synthesis followed by surface functionalization leading to tailormade properties for a specific purpose. Here, the design of robust &#8220;precursor&#8221; polymer&#8208;decorated silica nano&#8208; and microparticles is demonstrated, which allows for easy post&#8208;modification by polymer embedded thiolactone chemistry. To obtain this organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid material, silica particles (SiO2P) were functionalized via surface&#8208;initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI&#8208;ATRP) with poly(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl acrylate) (PHEA)&#8208;poly(thiolactone acrylamide (PThlAm) co&#8208;polymer brushes. Exploiting the versatility of thiolactone post&#8208;modification, a system was developed that could be used in three exemplary applications: 1) the straightforward molecular post&#8208;functionalization to tune the surface polarity, and therefore the dispersibility in various solvents; 2) the immobilization of metal nanoparticles into the polymer brushes via the in&#8197;situ formation of free thiols that preserved catalytic activity in a model reaction; 3) the formation of redox&#8208;responsive, permeable polymer capsules by crosslinking the thiolactone moieties with cystamine dihydrochloride (CDH) followed by dissolution of the silica core.

         <title>Towards Heteroleptic Dicoordinate CuII Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing a bulky carbazolyl substituent, heteroleptic dicoordinate copper complexes with CuII character were synthesised. Delocalisation of the spin density in the ligand scaffold as well as dispersion forces apparently play a role in the stabilisation of these compounds.







Abstract
In this work we detail our efforts to systematically generate stable dicoordinate CuII complexes. Initial experiments via metathesis reactions of a bulky potassium carbazolide (RK) with copper(II) salts indeed yielded a stable product, RCuOTf (1). However, subsequent attempts to grasp systematic synthetic access to complexes of the type RCuX (X=monoanionic ligand) proved difficult as many of the complexes rapidly decomposed in solution. By using triflate&#8208;related ligands such as ethyl sulfate and bistriflimide, the additional dicoordinate copper complexes RCuOSO3Et (2), [RCu(THF)][Cu(NTf2)2] (3) and RCuNTf2 (4) could be isolated. Spectroscopic indications corroborate more CuI than CuII character in all RCuX derivatives.

         <title>Consequences of amide connectivity in the supramolecular polymerization of porphyrins: spectroscopic observations rationalized by theoretical modelling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The correlation between molecular structure and mechanism of supramolecular polymerizations is a topic of great interest, with a special focus on the pathway complexity of porphyrin assemblies. Their cooperative polymerization typically yields highly ordered, long 1D polymers and is driven by a combination of &#960;&#8208;stacking due to solvophobic effects and hydrogen bonding interactions. Subtle changes in molecular structure, however, have significant influence on the cooperativity factor and yield different aggregate types (J&#8208; versus H&#8208;aggregates) of different lengths. In this study we investigate the influence of amide connectivity on the self&#8208;assembly behavior of porphyrin based supramolecular monomers. While in apolar solvents C=O centered monomers readily assemble into helical supramolecular polymers via a cooperative mechanism, their NH centered counterparts form short, non&#8208;helical J&#8208;type aggregates via an isodesmic pathway. With a combination of spectroscopy and density functional theory modelling, we shed light on the molecular origins causing this stunning difference in assembly properties and demonstrate the importance of molecular connectivity in the design of supramolecular systems. Finally, we present their mutual interference in copolymerization experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent 2D Patterning, Local Electronic Structure and Polarization Switching of Graphene at the Nanometer Level</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoscale patterning and tailoring of graphene was realized by a very facile and highly efficient approach, which includes a first&#8208;step patterned fluorination with a very high degree of functionalization, realized by laser writing, and a subsequent nucleophilic substitution of the attached fluorine atoms with thiophene groups.







Abstract
A very facile and efficient protocol for the covalent patterning and properties tuning of graphene is reported. Highly reactive fluorine radicals were added to confined regions of graphene directed by laser writing on graphene coated with 1&#8208;fluoro&#8208;3,3&#8208;dimethylbenziodoxole. This process allows for the realization of exquisite patterns on graphene with resolutions down to 200&#8197;nm. The degree of functionalization, ranging from the unfunctionalized graphene to extremely high functionalized graphene, can be precisely tuned by controlling the laser irradiation time. Subsequent substitution of the initially patterned fluorine atoms afforded an unprecedented graphene nanostructure bearing thiophene groups. This substitution led to a complete switch of both the electronic structure and the polarization within the patterned graphene regions. This approach paves the way towards the precise modulation of the structure and properties of nanostructured graphene.

         <title>5&#8208;Hydroxymethyl&#8208;, 5&#8208;Formyl&#8208; and 5&#8208;Carboxydeoxycytidines as Oxidative Lesions and Epigenetic Marks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exact UHPLC&#8208;MS2 quantifications were used to determine the oxidative lesion and epigenetically induced levels of the non&#8208;canonical bases hmdC, fdC and cadC and of the levels of base excision repair intermediates.







Abstract
The four non&#8208;canonical nucleotides in the human genome 5&#8208;methyl&#8208;, 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;, 5&#8208;formyl&#8208; and 5&#8208;carboxydeoxycytidine (mdC, hmdC, fdC and cadC) form a second layer of epigenetic information that contributes to the regulation of gene expression. Formation of the oxidized nucleotides hmdC, fdC and cadC requires oxidation of mdC by ten&#8208;eleven translocation (Tet) enzymes that require oxygen, Fe(II) and &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate as cosubstrates. Although these oxidized forms of mdC are widespread in mammalian genomes, experimental evidence for their presence in fungi and plants is ambiguous. This vagueness is caused by the fact that these oxidized mdC derivatives are also formed as oxidative lesions, resulting in unclear basal levels that are likely to have no epigenetic function. Here, we report the xdC levels in the fungus Amanita muscaria in comparison to murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs), HEK cells and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), to obtain information about the basal levels of hmdC, fdC and cadC as DNA lesions in the genome.

         <title>Tuning J&#8208;aggregate Formation and Emission Efficiency in Cationic Diazapentacenium Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new diazapentacenium salts have been obtained from a new synthetic methodology and shown to display a drastic increase of fluorescence quantum yields induced by aggregation (AIE phenomena) in poor solvents and associated to a particular type of aggregates organization: J&#8208;aggregates. A simple structural modification (4 H in D1 vs 4 F in D2) changes the contribution of J&#8208;aggregates which is quantitatively followed by time resolved fluorescence.







Abstract
Enhancement of the luminescence efficiency of two new diazapentacenium salts (D1 and D2) of more than 55 for D1 and 22 times for D2) in poor solvents, acetonitrile and/or dichloromethane, was observed and rationalized as formation of emissive J&#8208;aggregates. Both compounds displaying 4&#8208;n&#8208;decylphenyl substituents at the 7,14&#8208;carbons and phenyl (D1) or 2,6&#8208;difluorophenyl (D2) substituents at the quaternary nitrogen atoms in 5,12&#8208;positions have been synthetized in a two&#8208;step procedure involving a two&#8208;fold Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig&#8208;type CN cross&#8208;coupling and an electrophilic Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;type cyclization. The optical properties of the dicationic diazapentacenium salts in various solvents and in thin films have been investigated by steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopies. In thin films and in good solvents, isolated molecules coexist with aggregates. Nonetheless, D1 is seven times more emissive than D2, reflecting a higher J&#8208;aggregate contribution in the former.

         <title>The Mechanism of Cleavage of RNA Phosphodiesters by a Gold Nanoparticle Nanozyme</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uridine 3&#8217;&#8208;alkyl&#8208; and aryl&#8208;phosphodiesters are easily cleaved by gold nanozymes functionalized with Zn(II) ligands with a nucleophilic mechanism. The catalytic site requires two metal ions for catalysis and at least a third one for binding of the uridine nucleobase.







Abstract
The cleavage of uridine 3&#8217;&#8208;phosphodiesters bearing alcohols with pKa ranging from 7.14 to 14.5 catalyzed by AuNPs functionalized with 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane&#8208;Zn(II) complexes has been studied to unravel the source of catalysis by these nanosystems (nanozymes). The results have been compared with those obtained with two Zn(II) dinuclear catalysts for which the mechanism is fairly understood. Binding to the Zn(II) ions by the substrate and the uracil of uridine was observed. The latter leads to inhibition of the process and formation of less productive binding complexes than in the absence of the nucleobase. The nanozyme operates with these substrates mostly via a nucleophilic mechanism with little stabilization of the pentacoordinated phosphorane and moderate assistance in leaving group departure. This is attributed to a decrease of binding strength of the substrate to the catalytic site in reaching the transition state due to an unfavorable binding mode with the uracil. The nanozyme favors substrates with better leaving groups than the less acidic ones.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven gem Hydrogenation: An Orthogonal Entry into &#8220;Second&#8208;Generation&#8221; Ruthenium Carbene Catalysts for Olefin Metathesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
On the spot: Light&#8208;driven gem hydrogenation elicits the inherent vic&#8208;dicarbene character of a triple bond. This unusual reactivity mode can be harnessed in the form of a novel, safe, convenient and efficient approach to second&#8208;generation &#8220;Grubbs&#8208;Hoveyda&#8221;&#8208;type ruthenium carbene complexes for olefin metathesis that relies on the use of alkynes rather than diazoalkanes as the ultimate carbene sources.







Abstract
The newly discovered light&#8208;driven gem hydrogenation of alkynes opens an unconventional yet efficient entry into five&#8208;coordinate Grubbs&#8208;type ruthenium carbene complexes with cis&#8208;disposed chloride ligands. Representatives of this class featuring a chelate substructure formed by an iodo&#8208;substituted benzylidene unit react with (substituted) 2&#8208;isopropoxystyrene to give prototypical &#8220;second&#8208;generation&#8221; Grubbs&#8208;Hoveyda complexes for olefin metathesis. The new approach to this venerable catalyst family is safe and versatile as it uses a triple bond rather than phenyldiazomethane as the ultimate carbene source and does not require any sacrificial phosphines.

         <title>Rerouting and Improving Dauc&#8208;8&#8208;en&#8208;11&#8208;ol Synthase from Streptomyces venezuelae to a High Yielding Biocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Daucenol Synthase (DcS) from Streptomyces venezuelae was redirected using substrate analogues with additional, shifted, or lacking methyl groups to yield molecules from a naturally difficult to access chemical space, and improved in its catalytic efficiency through site&#8208;directed mutagenesis of surface residues, turning DcS into a high yielding biocatalyst.







Abstract
The dauc&#8208;8&#8208;en&#8208;11&#8208;ol synthase from Streptomyces venezuelae was investigated for its catalytic activity towards alternative terpene precursors, specifically designed to enable new cyclisation pathways. Exchange of aromatic amino acid residues at the enzyme surface by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis led to a 4&#8208;fold increase of the yield in preparative scale incubations, which likely results from an increased enzyme stability instead of improved enzyme kinetics.

Exchange of aromatic amino acid residues at the enzyme surface by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis led to a 4&#8208;fold increase of the yield in preparative scale incubations, which likely results from an increased enzyme stability instead of improved enzyme kinetics.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Prediction and Validation of a Druggable Site on Virulence Factor of Drug Resistant Burkholderia cenocepacia**

A new druggable site for anti&#8208;adhesive therapy. We used fragment&#8208;based virtual screening to explore the druggability of a region in the vicinity of the fucose binding site in a lectin from an opportunistic and highly drug&#8208;resistant pathogen. The crystal structure of the target protein complexed with the lead fragment validated the existence of a secondary binding site, paving the way for the design of potent ligands to be employed in anti&#8208;adhesive therapy.







Abstract
Burkholderia cenocepacia is an opportunistic Gram&#8208;negative bacterium that causes infections in patients suffering from chronic granulomatous diseases and cystic fibrosis. It displays significant morbidity and mortality due to extreme resistance to almost all clinically useful antibiotics. The bacterial lectin BC2L&#8208;C expressed in B. cenocepacia is an interesting drug target involved in bacterial adhesion and subsequent deadly infection to the host. We solved the first high resolution crystal structure of the apo form of the lectin N&#8208;terminal domain (BC2L&#8208;C&#8208;nt) and compared it with the ones complexed with carbohydrate ligands. Virtual screening of a small fragment library identified potential hits predicted to bind in the vicinity of the fucose binding site. A series of biophysical techniques and X&#8208;ray crystallographic screening were employed to validate the interaction of the hits with the protein domain. The X&#8208;ray structure of BC2L&#8208;C&#8208;nt complexed with one of the identified active fragments confirmed the ability of the site computationally identified to host drug&#8208;like fragments. The fragment affinity could be determined by titration microcalorimetry. These structure&#8208;based strategies further provide an opportunity to elaborate the fragments into high affinity anti&#8208;adhesive glycomimetics, as therapeutic agents against B. cenocepacia.

         <title>Fluorinated Azobenzenes Switchable with Red Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular photoswitches find rapidly growing applications in biocompatible materials and photopharmacology. ortho&#8208;Fluorinated azobenzenes bearing conjugated sp2 substituents can be effectively photoisomerized with light wavelengths above 630&#8197;nm, within the &#8220;therapeutic window&#8221;, which enables deep penetration of soft human tissues. This observation may therefore facilitate the design of new&#8208;generation stimuli&#8208;responsive therapeutics.







Abstract
Molecular photoswitches triggered with red or NIR light are optimal for photomodulation of complex biological systems, including efficient penetration of the human body for therapeutic purposes (&#8220;therapeutic window&#8221;). Yet, they are rarely reported, and even more rarely functional under aqueous conditions. In this work, fluorinated azobenzenes are shown to exhibit efficient E&#8594;Z photoisomerization with red light (PSS660nm &gt;75&#8201;% Z) upon conjugation with unsaturated substituents. Initially demonstrated for aldehyde groups, this effect was also observed in a more complex structure by incorporating the chromophore into a cyclic dipeptide with propensity for self&#8208;assembly. Under physiological conditions, the latter molecule formed a supramolecular material that reversibly changed its viscosity upon irradiation with red light. Our observation can lead to design of new photopharmacology agents or phototriggered materials for in&#8197;vivo use.

         <title>Chemical Bonding in Silicon Carbonyl Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Revisiting the chemical bond on silylene&#8208;carbonyl species reveals a donor&#8208;acceptor interaction between the CO and the silylene. The bonding can be conventionally understood as a &#963;&#8208;donation from the &#963;CO into the empty p&#8208;orbital of silicon, and a &#960;&#8208;back donation from the sp2 lone pair of silicon into the &#960;*CO antibonding orbitals. Nonetheless, an unrecognized &#960;&#8208;back&#8208;donation from the R&#8722;Si &#963;&#8208;orbital into the &#960;*CO antibonding orbital faithfully explains the relationship between structure and stability.







Abstract
Although silylene&#8208;carbonyl complexes are known for decades, only recently isolable examples have been accomplished. In this work, the bonding situation is re&#8208;evaluated to explain the origins of their remarkable stability within the Kohn&#8208;Sham molecular orbital theory framework. It is shown that the chemical bond can be understood as CO interaction with the silylene via a donor&#8208;acceptor interaction: a &#963;&#8208;donation from the &#963;CO into the empty p&#8208;orbital of silicon, and a &#960;&#8208;back donation from the sp2 lone pair of silicon into the &#960;*CO antibonding orbitals. Notably, it was established that the driving force behind the surprisingly stable Si&#8722;CO compounds, however, is another &#960;&#8208;back donation from a perpendicular bonding R&#8722;Si &#963;&#8208;orbital into the &#960;*CO antibonding orbitals. Consequently, the pyramidalization of the central silicon atom cannot be associated with the strength of the &#960;&#8208;back donation, in sharp contrast to the established chemical bonding model. Considering this additional bonding interaction not only shed light on the bonding situation, but is also an indispensable key for broadening the scope of silylene&#8208;carbonyl chemistry.

         <title>Lewis Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions: Reactivity Trends across the Periodic Table</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Periodic reactivity trends! Quantum chemical activation strain analyses reveal how various weakly interacting Lewis acids across the periodic table, based on hydrogen, pnictogen, chalcogen, and halogen bonds, accelerate the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between 1,3&#8208;butadiene and methyl acrylate by amplifying the degree of asynchronicity and reducing the Pauli repulsion between the reactants.







Abstract
The catalytic effect of various weakly interacting Lewis acids (LAs) across the periodic table, based on hydrogen (Group&#8197;1), pnictogen (Group&#8197;15), chalcogen (Group&#8197;16), and halogen (Group&#8197;17) bonds, on the Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition reaction between 1,3&#8208;butadiene and methyl acrylate was studied quantum chemically by using relativistic density functional theory. Weakly interacting LAs accelerate the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction by lowering the reaction barrier up to 3&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 compared to the uncatalyzed reaction. The reaction barriers systematically increase from halogen&lt;hydrogen&lt;chalcogen&lt;pnictogen&#8208;bonded LAs, i.&#8201;e., the latter have the least catalytic effect. Our detailed activation strain and Kohn&#8208;Sham molecular orbital analyses reveal that these LAs lower the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction barrier by increasing the asynchronicity of the reaction to relieve the otherwise destabilizing Pauli repulsion between the closed&#8208;shell filled &#960;&#8208;orbitals of diene and dienophile. Notably, the reactivity can be further enhanced on going from a Period 3 to a Period 5 LA, as these species amplify the asynchronicity of the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction due to a stronger binding to the dienophile. These findings again demonstrate the generality of the Pauli repulsion&#8208;lowering catalysis concept.

         <title>Transmembrane Transport of Bicarbonate Unravelled**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new assay to study bicarbonate transport is reported, which is based on a europium complex that is encapsulated inside liposomes and reports changes in the intravesicular concentration of bicarbonate in a direct and highly sensitive way. This assay was used to reveal that synthetic anion transporters can act via different mechanisms: 1) actual transport of HCO3&#8722; anions; 2) CO2 diffusion coupled to dissipation of the resulting transmembrane pH gradient.







Abstract
Anion receptors can be used to transport ions across lipid bilayers, which has potential for therapeutic applications. Synthetic bicarbonate transporters are of particular interest, as defects in transmembrane transport of bicarbonate are associated with various diseases. However, no convenient method exists to directly observe bicarbonate transport and study the mechanisms involved. Here, an assay is presented that allows the kinetics of bicarbonate transport into liposomes to be monitored directly and with great sensitivity. The assay utilises an encapsulated europium(III) complex, which exhibits a large increase in emission intensity upon binding bicarbonate. Mechanisms involving CO2 diffusion and the dissipation of a pH gradient are shown to be able to lead to an increase in bicarbonate concentration within liposomes, without transport of the anion occurring at all. By distinguishing these alternative mechanisms from actual bicarbonate transport, this assay will inform the future development of bicarbonate transporters.

         <title>Electrochemical Dehydrogenative C(sp2)&#8722;H Amination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8216;Power'ful Aminations. A simple transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free direct electrolytic amination strategy has been developed. The transformation takes place in the absence of any electrocatalyst by using cheap and easily available graphite electrodes. The reaction allows for the synthesis of carbazole derivatives via intramolecular C&#8722;H amination and also cross&#8208;coupling of (hetero)arenes and various N&#8208;arylamides in an undivided cell set up. The usage of an acidic solvent was beneficial as it eliminated the requirement of additional supporting electrolytes for the electrolysis.







Abstract
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free direct electrolytic C&#8722;H amination involving an electrochemically generated nitrenium ion intermediate has been developed. The electrosynthesis takes place in the absence of any organoiodine catalysts and is enabled by an in&#8197;situ generated electrolyte. A novel, efficient intramolecular and intermolecular C&#8722;H amination has been demonstrated using a simple reaction setup.

         <title>Crystal Structures of AlCr2 and MoSi2: Same Structure Type vs Different Bonding Pattern</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In a joint effort utilizing modified sample preparation, microscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction and micro&#8208;fabrication, it became possible to prepare single crystals of the &#8220;hidden&#8221; phase AlCr  2  . High&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis is described in detail for two crystals with the similar overall composition, but different degree of disorder, which seems to be the main cause for the differing unit cell parameters. Chemical bonding analysis of AlCr  2  in comparison to prototypical MoSi  2  shows pronounced differences reflecting the interchange of main group element vs. transition metal as majority component.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Difluoroglycine Derivatives from Amines, Difluorocarbene, and CO2: Computational Design, Scope, and Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A three&#8208;component reaction (3CR) for the synthesis of difluoroglycine derivatives has been achieved using amines, difluorocarbene (generated  in situ  ), and the abundant, inexpensive, and non&#8208;toxic C1 source CO  2  . Various  tert  &#8208;amines and pyridine, (iso)quinoline, imidazole, thiazole, and pyrazole derivatives were incorporated, and the corresponding products were isolated in solid form without purification using column chromatography on silica gel. Detailed reaction profiles of the 3CR were obtained via computational analysis using DFT calculations, and the results critically suggest that simple ammonia is not applicable to this reaction. In addition, strongly supported by computational predictions, a new reagent that can generate difluorocarbene at 0 &#176;C without any additives was discovered. Furthermore, radical substitution reactions of the obtained difluoroglycine derivatives under photoredox conditions, as well as a synthetic application as an  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand are shown.</dc:description>

         <title>Inherent Ethyl Acetate Selectivity in a&#160;Trianglimine Molecular Solid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ethyl acetate is an important chemical raw material and solvent. It is also a key volatile organic compound in the brewing industry and a marker for lung cancer. Materials that are highly selective toward ethyl acetate are needed for its separation and detection. Here, we report a trianglimine macrocycle ( TAMC ) that selectively adsorbs ethyl acetate by forming a solvate. Crystal structure prediction showed this to be the lowest energy solvate structure available. This solvate leaves a metastable, &#8216;templated&#8217; cavity after solvent removal. Adsorption and breakthrough experiments confirmed that imprinted TAMC has adequate adsorption kinetics to separate ethyl acetate from azeotropic mixtures with ethanol, which is a challenging and energy&#8208;intensive industrial separation.</dc:description>

         <title>An Environmentally Friendly, Photochemical Access to [N^C^N]Au(III) Pincer Complexes by Oxidative Addition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Starting from commercially available DMSAuCl and diazonium salts, cationic [N^C^N]Au(III) complexes were synthesized in a selective, photosensitizer&#8208;free, photochemical reaction by irradiation with blue LED light. This new protocol represents the first easy synthesis of these types of pincer&#8208;complexes in moderate to excellent yield starting from a readily available gold(I) precursor with nitrogen as the only byproduct. Owing to the disadvantages of known protocols, especially the toxicity in case of a transmetallation with mercury or the necessity for a mostly twofold excess of a gold precursor, this method offers an attractive alternative towards this kind of gold(III) complexes. In addition, the first arylated [N^C^N]Au(III) pincer&#8208;complex was synthesized by using this technology.</dc:description>

         <title>1,2&#8208; or 1,3&#8208;Hydride Shifts &#8211; What controls Guaiane Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A systematic computational study addressing the entire chemical space of guaianes in conjunction with an analysis of all known compounds shows that 1,3&#8208;hydride shifts are rare events in guaiane biosynthesis. As demonstrated here, 1,3&#8208;hydride shifts towards guaianes can only be realized for two stereochemically well defined out of numerous possible stereoisomeric skeletons. One example is given by the mechanism of guaia&#8208;4(15)&#8208;en&#8208;11&#8208;ol synthase from California poplar, an enzyme that yields guaiane sesquiterpenes with unusual stereochemical properties. The generalizing results from DFT calculations were experimentally verified through isotopic labeling experiments with guaia&#8208;4(15)&#8208;en&#8208;11&#8208;ol synthase.</dc:description>

         <title>Building an Iron Chromophore Incorporating Prussian Blue Analogue for Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The replacement of traditional ruthenium&#8208;based photosensitizers with low&#8208;cost and abundant iron analogs is a key step for the advancement of scalable and sustainable dye&#8208;sensitized water splitting cells. Herein this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, we utilize a pyridinium ligand coordinated pentacyanoferrate(II) chromophore to construct a cyanide&#8208;based CoFe extended bulk framework, in which the iron photosensitizer units are connected to cobalt water oxidation catalytic sites through cyanide linkers. The iron&#8208;sensitized photoanode exhibits exceptional stability for at least 5 hours at pH 7 and features its photosensitizing ability with an incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;current conversion capacity up to 500 nm with nanosecond scale excited state lifetime. Ultrafast transient absorption and computational studies reveal that iron and cobalt sites mutually support each other for charge separation via short bridging cyanide groups and for injection to the semiconductor in our proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept photoelectrochemical device. The reorganization of the excited states due to the mixing of electronic states of metal&#8208;based orbitals subsequently tailor the electron transfer cascade during the photoelectrochemical process. This breakthrough in chromophore&#8208;catalyst assemblies will spark interest in dye&#8208;sensitization with robust bulk systems for photoconversion applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks toward Diverse Photocatalytic Aerobic Oxidations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
COFs in photocatalytic oxidation of organics: Hydrazone&#8208;based 2D&#8208;COF&#8208;1 offers a fascinating alternative photocatalyst for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven selective aerobic oxidation of valuable small organics such as amines, ethers, thioethers and pyridinium salts. By means of its superior photocatalytic ability in molecular oxygen activation and inherent heterogenous nature, the present protocol exhibits impressive efficiency, selectivity and sustainability.







Abstract
Photoactive two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D&#8208;COFs) have become promising heterogenous photocatalysts in visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven organic transformations. Herein, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven selective aerobic oxidation of various small organic molecules by using 2D&#8208;COFs as the photocatalyst was developed. In this protocol, due to the remarkable photocatalytic capability of hydrazone&#8208;based 2D&#8208;COF&#8208;1 on molecular oxygen activation, a wide range of amides, quinolones, heterocyclic compounds, and sulfoxides were obtained with high efficiency and excellent functional group tolerance under very mild reaction conditions. Furthermore, benefiting from the inherent advantage of heterogenous photocatalysis, prominent sustainability and easy photocatalyst recyclability, a drug molecule (modafinil) and an oxidized mustard gas simulant (2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfoxide) were selectively and easily obtained in scale&#8208;up reactions. Mechanistic investigations were conducted using radical quenching experiments and in&#8197;situ ESR spectroscopy, all corroborating the proposed role of 2D&#8208;COF&#8208;1 in photocatalytic cycle.

         <title>Programmed Multiple C&#8208;H Bond Functionalization of the Privileged 4&#8208;hydroxyquinoline Template</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of substituents on a &#8220;programmed&#8221; 4&#8208;hydroxyquinoline was selectively achieved by directed multiple C&#8722;H functionalizations. It could be decorated on four positions, successively at C&#8208;8, C&#8208;2, C&#8208;3 and C&#8208;5, three of which by using transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions. Our study highlights the power of multiple C&#8722;H functionalization to generate diversity in a biologically relevant library, after showing its strong antimalarial potential.







Abstract
The introduction of substituents on bare heterocyclic scaffolds can selectively be achieved by directed C&#8722;H functionalization. However, such methods have only occasionally been used, in an iterative manner, to decorate various positions of a medicinal scaffold to build chemical libraries. We herein report the multiple, site selective, metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization of a &#8220;programmed&#8221; 4&#8208;hydroxyquinoline. This medicinally privileged template indeed possesses multiple reactive sites for diversity&#8208;oriented functionalization, of which four were targeted. The C&#8208;2 and C&#8208;8 decorations were directed by an N&#8208;oxide, before taking benefit of an O&#8208;carbamoyl protection at C&#8208;4 to perform a Fries rearrangement and install a carboxamide at C&#8208;3. This also released the carbonyl group of 4&#8208;quinolones, the ultimate directing group to functionalize position 5. Our study highlights the power of multiple C&#8722;H functionalization to generate diversity in a biologically relevant library, after showing its strong antimalarial potential.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Emitters Exhibiting Red to Near&#8208;Infrared Emission Derived from Intermolecular Charge&#8208;Transfer Triplet States of Naphthalenediimide&#8722;Halobenzoate Triad Molecules</title>

         <dc:description>
A simple naphthalenediimide derivative with efficient room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) properties, showing red to near&#8208;infrared emission in both solid and aqueous dispersion is demonstrated. The spin&#8208;orbit coupling values are evaluated using TD&#8208;DFT calculations and show that the intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer interaction and the positions of iodine as heavy atom are essential to realize efficient RTP.







Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emitters have attracted significant attention. However, purely organic RTP emitters in red to near&#8208;infrared region have not been properly investigated. In this study, a series of naphthalenediimide&#8722;halobenzoate&#8208;linked molecules are synthesized, one of which exhibits efficient RTP properties, showing red to near&#8208;infrared emission in solid and aqueous dispersion. Spectroscopic studies and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis have shown that the difference in the stacking modes of compounds affects the optical properties, and the formation of intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer complexes of naphthalenediimide&#8722;halobenzoate moiety results in a bathochromic shift of absorption and RTP properties. The time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations showed that the formation of charge&#8208;transfer triplet states and the external heavy atom effect of the halogen atom enhance the intersystem crossing between excited singlet and triplet states.

         <title>Natural&#8208;Like Spirocyclic &#916;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;Butenolides Obtained from Diazo Homophthalimides</title>

         <dc:description>
Natural&#8208;like &#916;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;spirobutenolides were accessed via Rh(II)&#8208;catalyzed O&#8722;H insertion into propiolic acids followed by DIPEA&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig Michael addition. The resulting spirocyclic Michael acceptors were shown to inhibit thioredoxin reductase, a selenoprotein cancer target. Moreover, some of these compounds were shown to selectively bind selenocysteine in the presence of a 10&#8208;fold excess of cysteine.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Diazo homophotalimides were reacted with various propiolic acids on Rh2(esp)2 catalysis. The resulting propiolate esters were transformed into novel, heterocyclic &#916;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;spirobutenolides in good to excellent product yields. The approach represents a fundamentally novel entry into natural&#8208;like &#916;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;spirobutenolides present in many biologically active natural products as well as fully synthetic compounds endowed with diverse biological activities. The &#916;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;spirobutenolides thus obtained were shown to inhibit thioredoxin reductase, a selenocysteine enzyme target for cancer. Moreover, for the best compound in the series (TrxR IC50 1.49&#177;0.08&#8197;&#956;M), by using MALDI&#8208;TOF mass&#8208;spectrometry it was shown that it selectively binds selenocysteine in the presence of a 10&#8208;fold excess of cysteine. This validates the new compound as a promising lead for anticancer therapy development.

         <title>N&#8208;Doped Porous Carbon Derived from Solvent&#8208;Free Synthesis of Cross&#8208;Linked Triazine Polymers for Simultaneously Achieving CO2 Capture and Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high surface area and high nitrogen content porous carbon was obtained by the rational design and pyrolysis of cross&#8208;linked triazine polymers. Such porous carbon as a CO2 adsorbent, exhibits a high CO2 adsorption capability at 5.67&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 298.15&#8197;K and excellent stability. As an anode for supercapacitors, it delivers A&#8201;good specific capacitance of 158.8&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
It is highly desirable to design advanced heteroatomic doped porous carbon for wide application. Herein, N&#8208;doped porous carbon (NPC) was developed via the fabrication of high nitrogen cross&#8208;linked triazine polymers followed by pyrolysis and activation with controllable porous structure. The as&#8208;synthesized NPC at the pyrolysis temperature of 700&#8201;&#176;C possessed rich nitrogen content (up to 11.51&#8201;%) and high specific surface area (1353&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1), which led to a high CO2 adsorption capability at 5.67&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 298.15&#8197;K and 5&#8197;bar pressure and excellent stability. When the activation temperature was at 600&#8201;&#176;C, such NPC exhibited a superior electrochemical performance as anode for supercapacitors with a specific capacitance of 158.8 and 113&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 in 6&#8197;M KOH at a current density of 1 and 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively. Notably, it delivered an excellent stability with capacity retention of 97.4&#8201;% at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1after 6000 cycles.

         <title>Preparation and Properties of Benzylsulfonyl&#8208;Containing Silicone Copolymers via Ring&#8208;opening Copolymerization of Macroheterocyclosiloxane and Cyclosiloxane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of benzylsulfonyl macroheterocyclosiloxane and five different cyclosiloxanes was systematically investigated for the first time. A general approach for the synthesis of benzylsulfonyl&#8208;containing silicone copolymers with various substituents, including methyl, vinyl, ethyl, and phenyl, was developed herein. Notably, the obtained polymers with adjustable structures and benzylsulfonyl macroheterocyclosiloxane content possessed composition&#8208;dependent properties, including thermal, surface, and mechanical characteristics. The copolymers also emitted blue fluorescence due to the clustering&#8208;triggered emission and luminescence of nonconventional luminogens.







Abstract
Ring&#8208;opening copolymerization (ROCP) of benzylsulfonyl macroheterocyclosiloxane (BSM) and five different cyclosiloxanes was systematically investigated. A general approach for the synthesis of benzylsulfonyl&#8208;containing silicone copolymers with various substituents, including methyl, vinyl, ethyl, and phenyl, was developed herein. A series of copolymers with variable incorporation (from 6&#8201;% to 82&#8201;%) of BSM were obtained by modifying the comonomer feed ratio and using KOH as the catalyst in a mixed solvent of dimethylformamide and toluene. The obtained copolymers exhibited various composition&#8208;dependent properties and unique viscoelasticity. Notably, the surface and fluorescent characteristics as well as the glass transition temperatures of the copolymers could be tailored by varying the amount of BSM. Unlike typical sulfone&#8208;containing polymers, such as poly(olefin sulfone)s, the prepared copolymers displayed excellent thermal and hydrolytic stability. The universal strategy developed in the present study provides a platform for the design of innovative silicone copolymers with adjustable structures and performance.

         <title>Intertwined Analytical, Experimental and Theoretical Studies on the Formation and Structure of a Copper Dienolate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intertwined analytical, experimental and theoretical study disclose the mechanism of formation of an organocopper dienolate reagent from its silylated precursor. The study shed light on the Cu(II) to Cu(I) reduction process, the Si to Cu exchange mechanism and finally the metallotropic equilibrium of the resulting copper dienolate.







Abstract
The reaction of a silyl dienolate, a Cu(II) salt and TBAT yielding the corresponding copper dienolate is addressed. A combined NMR and cyclic voltammetry analysis first highlight the role of TBAT in the Cu(II) to Cu(I) reduction and the structure of the precatalytic species. From these first results a second set of NMR and theoretical studies enable the determination of the structure and the mechanism of formation of the copper dienolate catalytic species. Finally, we showed that that the copper catalyst promote the E/Z s&#8208;cis/s&#8208;trans equilibration of the silyl dienolate precursor through a copper dienolate intermediate.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An intertwined analytical, experimental and theoretical study&lt;/b&gt; disclose the mechanism of formation of an organocopper dienolate reagent from its silylated precursor. The study shed light on the Cu(II) to Cu(I) reduction process, the Si to Cu exchange mechanism and finally the metallotropic equilibrium of the resulting copper dienolate.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reaction of a silyl dienolate, a Cu(II) salt and TBAT yielding the corresponding copper dienolate is addressed. A combined NMR and cyclic voltammetry analysis first highlight the role of TBAT in the Cu(II) to Cu(I) reduction and the structure of the precatalytic species. From these first results a second set of NMR and theoretical studies enable the determination of the structure and the mechanism of formation of the copper dienolate catalytic species. Finally, we showed that that the copper catalyst promote the E/Z s&#8208;cis/s&#8208;trans equilibration of the silyl dienolate precursor through a copper dienolate intermediate. All of these results unveil some peculiarities of the catalytic and asymmetric vinylogous Mukaiyama reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Structural Insights into the Molecular Recognition Mechanism of the Cancer and Pathogenic Epitope, LacdiNAc by Immune&#8208;Related Lectins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular determinants that govern the binding of the tumour and pathogenic LacdiNAc (LDN) epitope by two human lectins, hGal&#8208;3 and hMGL, including the comparison with the natural LacNAc (LN) epitope, were unveiled. These findings are essential for chemical designing mimetics to selective target hGal&#8208;3 and hMGL.







Abstract
Interactions of glycan&#8208;specific epitopes to human lectin receptors represent novel immune checkpoints for investigating cancer and infection diseases. By employing a multidisciplinary approach that combines isothermal titration calorimetry, NMR spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, and X&#8208;ray crystallography, we investigated the molecular determinants that govern the recognition of the tumour and pathogenic glycobiomarker LacdiNAc (GalNAc&#946;1&#8208;4GlcNAc, LDN), including their comparison with the ubiquitous LacNAc epitope (Gal&#946;1&#8208;4GlcNAc, LN), by two human immune&#8208;related lectins, galectin&#8208;3 (hGal&#8208;3) and the macrophage galactose C&#8208;type lectin (hMGL). A different mechanism of binding and interactions was observed for the hGal&#8208;3/LDN and hMGL/LDN complexes, which explains the remarkable difference in the binding specificity of LDN and LN by these two lectins. The new structural clues reported herein are fundamental for the chemical design of mimetics targeting hGal&#8208;3/hMGL recognition process.

         <title>Quadruple Photoresponsive Functionality in a Crystalline Hybrid Material: Photochromism, Photomodulated Fluorescence, Magnetism and Nonlinear Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystalline hybrid material is reported with quadruple photoresponsive functionality, which shows photochromism, photomodulated fluorescence, magnetism, and second&#8208;order nonlinear optical properties. This work provides a general method to construct hybrid photochromic materials with multiple photoresponsive performances.







Abstract
As promising photoresponsive materials and potential smart materials, hybrid photochromic materials (HPMs), especially for crystalline HPMs (CHPMs), have been broadly explored for their potential in inheriting the merits of each constituents, and intriguing photomodulated functionality. Hitherto, the photoresponsive functionality in explored CHPMs mainly concentrate on dyad combination. By contrast, triple or quadruple photoresponsive properties are very rare because of the limited compatibility of multiple photoresponsive functionality in a single system. In this work, the electron&#8208;transfer (ET) and crystal engineering strategies were utilized to predesign CHPMs with multiple photoresponsive properties via the collaboration of paramagnetic metal ion (Dy3+), electron&#8208;donor (ED) ligand (benzene&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;tricarboxylic acid, H3BTA) and electron&#8208;acceptor (EA) ligand (1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, phen). The resulting complex [Dy(BTA)(phen)2]&#8901;2H2O (1) shows hybrid chain with the intrachain Dy3+ ions bridged and chelated by tricarboxylate and phen ligands, respectively. After photostimuli, the ET between tricarboxylate and phen results in photogenerated radicals and the resultant quadruple photoresponsive properties. Considering the abundant resources of paramagnetic metal ions, ED&#8208; and EA&#8208;ligands, this work provides a general method to construct CHPMs with multiple photoresponsive performances via the collaboration of each unit under the guidance of ET and crystal engineering strategies.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Multivalent Ag&#8208;SR Coordination Polymers with Phosphatase&#8208;Like Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of self&#8208;assembled multivalent Ag&#8208;SR coordination polymers with high phosphatase&#8208;like activity have been developed. This work represents a new alternative for the future rational design of highly efficient catalysts for hydrolysis of phosphates and carboxylates.







Abstract
We show herein the phosphatase&#8208;like catalytic activity of coordination polymers obtained after adding Ag+&#8208;ions to thiols bearing hydrophobic alkyl chains terminated with a 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane (TACN) group. The subsequent addition of Zn2+ &#8208;ions to the self&#8208;assembled polymers resulted in the formation of multivalent metal coordination polymers capable of catalysing the transphosphorylation of an RNA&#8208;model compound (2&#8208;hydroxypropyl&#8208;4&#8208;nitrophenyl phosphate, HPNPP) with high reactivity. Analysis of a series of metal ions showed that the highest catalytic activity was obtained when Ag+&#8208;ions were used as the first metal ions to construct the backbone of the coordination polymer through interaction with the &#8208;SH group followed by Zn2+&#8208;ions as the second metal ions complexed by the TACN&#8208;macrocycle. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the catalytic activity could be modulated by changing the length of the hydrophobic alkyl chain.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Partially Saturated Fluorenyl&#8208;Derived [n]Helicenes Featuring an Overcrowded Alkene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Blocking a molecular motor: The partially saturated H6&#8208;fluoreno[n]helicenes (see figure), cyclic analogs of the well&#8208;known Feringa's molecular motors, are produced via a similar McMurry cyclization approach. While being composed of three diastereoisomers, they serve as valuable intermediates for the efficient, multi&#8208;gram scale access to the aromatic fluoreno[n]helicenes.







Abstract
The straightforward, multigram&#8208;scale synthesis of the partially saturated H6&#8208;fluoreno[n]helicenes (n=5 or 7) featuring a central, overcrowded alkene is described. The key cyclization step was based on an intramolecular McMurry reaction from the corresponding 1,5&#8208;diketones. Chiral stationary phase HPLC analysis and isomer separation indicate that each helicenic compound is constituted of three diastereoisomers at room temperature, i.&#8201;e. the configurationally stable (R,R,P)/(S,S,M) pair of enantiomers and an apparently achiral compound resulting from the rapid interconversion between the (R,S,P) and (S,R,M) enantiomers. The partially saturated H6&#8208;fluoreno[n]helicenes are oxidatively aromatized to give an efficient access to the corresponding fluoreno[n]helicenes. The chiroptical properties (vibrational and electronic circular dichroism) of the chiral, enantiopure compounds have been measured and analyzed by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, confirming their helicoidal nature.

         <title>On the Reactivity Enhancement of Graphene by Metallic Substrates towards Aryl Nitrene Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The covalent functionalization of pristine graphene activated by metal substrates towards nitrenes is presented. Observed rate constants reveal that graphene supported on Ni (G/Ni) has the highest reactivity towards nitrenes, followed by G/Cu and then G/silicon wafer. DFT results indicate that increased charge transfer to graphene contribute to the higher reactivity with G/Ni. These results suggest that substrate activation represents an effective and novel strategy for functionalizing graphene using nitrenes potentially extending to other electron deficient reactants.







Abstract
Pristine graphene is fairly inert chemically, and as such, most application&#8208;driven studies use graphene oxide, or reduced graphene oxide. Using substrates to modulate the reactivity of graphene represents a unique strategy in the covalent functionalization of this otherwise fairly inert material. It was found that the reactivity of pristine graphene towards perfluorophenyl azide (PFPA) can be enhanced by a metal substrate on which graphene is supported. Results on the extent of functionalization, defect density, and reaction kinetics all show that graphene supported on Ni (G/Ni) has the highest reactivity toward PFPA, followed by G/Cu and then G/silicon wafer. DFT calculations suggest that the metal substrate stabilizes the physisorbed nitrene through enhanced electron transfer to the singlet nitrene from the graphene surface assisted by the electron rich metal substrate. The G/Ni substantially stabilizes the singlet nitrene relative to G/Cu and the free&#8208;standing graphene. The product structure is also predicted to be substrate dependent. These findings open up opportunities to enhance the reactivity of pristine graphene simply through the selection of the substrate. This also represents a new and powerful approach to increasing the reactivity of singlet nitrenes through direct electronic communication with graphene.

         <title>Low&#8208;Spin and High&#8208;Spin Perferryl Intermediates in Non&#8208;Heme Iron Catalyzed Oxidations of Aliphatic C&#8722;H Groups</title>

Direct C&#8722;H activation: Investigation of the oxidation of aliphatic C&#8722;H groups in the presence of nonheme iron catalysts of the Fe(PDP) family exhibits no uniform correlation between the spin state and reactivity of the oxoiron(V) intermediates and the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity of the corresponding catalyst systems, thus witnessing apparent violation of the common &#8220;reactivity&#8208;selectivity&#8221; principle for this reaction.







Abstract
The selectivity patterns of iron catalysts of the Fe(PDP) family in aliphatic C&#8722;H oxidation with H2O2 have been studied (PDP=N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyrrolidine). Cyclohexane, adamantane, 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;3,7&#8208;dimethyloctane, 3,7&#8208;dimethyloctyl acetate, (&#8722;)&#8208;acetoxy&#8208;p&#8208;menthane, and cis&#8208;1,2&#8208;dimethylcyclohexane were used as substrates. The studied catalyst systems generate low&#8208;spin (S=1/2) oxoiron(V) intermediates or high&#8208;spin (S=3/2) oxoiron(V) intermediates, depending on the electron&#8208;donating ability of remote substituents at the pyridine rings. The low&#8208;spin perferryl intermediates demonstrate lower stability and higher reactivity toward aliphatic C&#8722;H groups of cyclohexane than their high&#8208;spin congeners, according to the measured self&#8208;decay and second&#8208;order rate constants k1 and k2. Unexpectedly, there appears to be no uniform correlation between the spin state of the oxoiron(V) intermediates, and the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity of the corresponding catalyst systems in the oxidation of the considered substrates. This contrasts with the asymmetric epoxidations by the same catalyst systems, in which case the epoxidation enantioselectivity increases when passing from the systems featuring the more reactive low&#8208;spin perferryl intermediates to those with their less reactive high&#8208;spin congeners.

         <title>Activated Self&#8208;Resolution and Error&#8208;Correction in Catalytic Reaction Networks**

A dynamic covalent Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (MBH) reaction is demonstrated and applied to the generation of dynamic catalyst systems. The systems exhibited triggered self&#8208;resolution, preferentially amplifying a specific catalyst/product set out of a many potential alternatives, as well as systemic thermodynamically driven error&#8208;correction.







Abstract
Understanding the emergence of function in complex reaction networks is a primary goal of systems chemistry and origin&#8208;of&#8208;life studies. Especially challenging is to create systems that simultaneously exhibit several emergent functions that can be independently tuned. In this work, a multifunctional complex reaction network of nucleophilic small molecule catalysts for the Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (MBH) reaction is demonstrated. The dynamic system exhibited triggered self&#8208;resolution, preferentially amplifying a specific catalyst/product set out of a many potential alternatives. By utilizing selective reversibility of the products of the reaction set, systemic thermodynamically driven error&#8208;correction could also be introduced. To achieve this, a dynamic covalent MBH reaction based on adducts with internal H&#8208;transfer capabilities was developed. By careful tuning of the substituents, rate accelerations of retro&#8208;MBH reactions of up to four orders of magnitude could be obtained. This study thus demonstrates how efficient self&#8208;sorting of catalytic systems can be achieved through an interplay of several complex emergent functionalities.

         <title>Proton&#8208;transfer Dynamics of Photoacidic Merocyanines in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoacids attract increasing scientific attention, as they are valuable tools to spatiotemporally control proton&#8208;release reactions and pH values of solutions. We present the first time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic study of the excited state and proton&#8208;release dynamics of prominent merocyanine representatives. Femtosecond transient absorption measurements of a pyridine merocyanine with two distinct protonation sites revealed dissimilar proton&#8208;release mechanisms: one site acts as a photoacid generator as its pK  a  value is modulated in the ground state after photoisomerization, while the other functions as an excited state photoacid which releases its proton within 1.1 ps. With a pK  a  drop of 8.7 units to &#8208;5.5 upon excitation, the latter phenolic site is regarded a super&#8208;photoacid. The 6&#8208;nitro derivative exhibits only a phenolic site with similar, yet slightly less photoacidic characteristics and both compounds transfer their proton to methanol and ethanol. In contrast, for the related 6,8&#8208;dinitro compound an intramolecular proton transfer to the  ortho  &#8208;nitro group is suggested that is involved in a rapid relaxation into the ground state.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Guanidine&#8208;Based Hybrid Perovskite with Strong Dichroism for Multiwavelength Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites, benefiting from their natural anisotropy of quantum&#8208;well motifs and optical properties, have shown remarkable polarization&#8208;dependent responses superior to the 3D counterparts. Here, for the first time, we fabricated the multiwavelength polarization&#8208;sensitive detectors using single crystals of a guanidine&#8208;based 2D hybrid perovskite, (BA)  2  (GA)Pb  2  I  7  (where BA  +  is  n  &#8208;butylammonium and GA  +  is guanidium). Its unique 2D quantum&#8208;well structure results in strong crystallographic&#8208;dependence of optical absorption. Strikingly, our crystal&#8208;based photodetector exhibits a prominent photocurrent dichroic ratio (  I  max  /  I  min  ) of ~2.2 at 520 nm, higher than the typical 2D inorganic materials (GeSe, ~1.09, PdSe  2  , ~1.8). Besides, notable dichroic ratios of 1.29 and 1.23 at 405 nm and 637 nm are also created for the multiwavelength polarized&#8208;light detection. The prominent detecting performances, including low dark current (1.6&#215;10  &#8208;11  A), considerable on/off ratio (~2&#215;10  3  ), high photodetectivity (~3.3&#215;10  11  Jones) and responsivity (~12.01 mA&#183;W  &#8208;1  ), make (BA)  2  (GA)Pb  2  I  7  a promising candidate for polarized&#8208;light detection. This work sheds light on the rational engineering of new 2D hybrid perovskites for the high&#8208;performance optoelectronic device applications.</dc:description>

This work sheds light on the rational engineering of new 2D hybrid perovskites for the high&#8208;performance optoelectronic device applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational Enzyme Design without Structural Knowledge: A Sequence&#8208;Based Approach for Efficient Generation of Transglycosylases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycobiology is dogged by the relative scarcity of synthetic, defined oligosaccharides. Enzyme&#8208;catalysed glycosylation using glycoside hydrolases is feasible but is hampered by the innate hydrolytic activity of these enzymes. Protein engineering is useful to remedy this, but it usually requires prior structural knowledge of the target enzyme, and/or relies on extensive, time&#8208;consuming screening and analysis. Here we describe a straightforward strategy that involves rational rapid  in silico  analysis of protein sequences. The method pinpoints 6&#8210;12 single mutant candidates to improve transglycosylation yields. Requiring very little prior knowledge of the target enzyme other than its sequence, the method is generic and procures catalysts for the formation of glycosidic bonds involving various  d  /  l  &#8208;, &#945;/&#946;&#8208;pyranosides or furanosides, and  exo  &#8208; and  endo  &#8208;action. Moreover, mutations validated in one enzyme can be transposed to others, even distantly related enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic DNA&#8208; and protein&#8208;based recognition promote an RNA&#8208;templated bio&#8208;orthogonal reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biomolecular assemblies composed of proteins and oligonucleotides play a central role in biological processes. While in nature, oligonucleotides and proteins usually assemble via non&#8208;covalent interactions, synthetic conjugates have been developed which covalently link both modalities. The resulting peptide&#8208;oligonucleotide conjugates have facilitated novel biological applications as well as the design of functional supramolecular systems and materials. However, despite the importance of concerted protein/oligonucleotide recognition in nature, conjugation approaches have barely utilized the synergistic recognition abilities of such complexes. Herein, we report the structure&#8208;based design of peptide&#8208;DNA conjugates which bind RNA through Watson&#8208;Crick base pairing combined with peptide&#8208;mediated major groove recognition. Two distinct conjugate families with tunable binding characteristics have been designed to adjacently bind a particular RNA sequence. In the resulting ternary complex, their peptide elements are located in proximity, a feature that was used to enable an RNA&#8208;templated click reaction. The introduced structure&#8208;based design approach opens the door to novel functional biomolecular assemblies.</dc:description>

         <title>Vacant Manganese&#8208;Based Perovskite Fluorides@Reduced Graphene Oxides for Na&#8208;ion Storage with Pseudocapacitive Conversion/Insertion Dual Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Na&#8208;ion capacitors  (NICs) and Na&#8208;ion&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion batteries (Na&#8208;DIBs) have been considered to be promising alternatives to traditional lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) because of Na&#8208;ion abundance and low cost, but their energy density, power density and cycle life are limited.  Herein, d  ual vacancies (including K  +  and F  &#8208;  vacancies) perovskite fluoride K  0.86  MnF  2.69  @  reduced graphene oxide  (rGO) (recorded as Mn&#8208;G) as anode for NICs and Na&#8208;DIBs have been developed. The special conversion/intercalation dual Na&#8208;ion  energy storage mechanism  and pseudocapacitive dynamics are analyzed in detail.  The Mn&#8208;G//AC NICs and Mn&#8208;G//KS6 Na&#8208;DIBs delivered  a maximum energy density of 92.7 Wh kg  &#8208;1  and 187.6 Wh kg  &#8208;1  , maximum power density of 20.2 kW kg  &#8208;1  and 21.12 kW kg  &#8208;1  , and long cycle performance of 61.3% and 68.4% after 1000 cycles at 5 A g  &#8208;1  , respectively. Moreover, Mn&#8208;G//AC NICs  and Mn&#8208;G//KS6 Na&#8208;DIBs can work well in a wide range of temperatures (&#8208;20&#8208;40 &#176;C).  This result makes it competitive in Na&#8208;ion storage applications with high energy/power density in a wide temperature range.</dc:description>

         <title>Co3O4&#8208;CeO2 nanocomposites for Low Temperature CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In an effort to combine the favorable catalytic properties of Co3O4 and CeO2, nanocomposites with different phase distribution and Co3O4 loading were prepared and employed for CO oxidation. Synthesizing Co3O4&#8208;modified CeO2 via three different sol&#8208;gel based routes, each with 10.4 wt% Co3O4 loading, yielded three different nanocomposite morphologies: CeO2&#8208;supported Co3O4 layers, intermixed oxides and homogeneously dispersed Co. The reactivity of the resulting surface oxygen species towards CO were examined by temperature programmed reduction (CO&#8208;TPR) and flow reactor kinetic tests. The first morphology exhibited the best performance due to its active Co3O4 surface layer, reducing the light&#8208;off temperature of CeO2 by about 200 &#8451;. In contrast, intermixed oxides and Co&#8208;doped CeO2 suffered from lower dispersion and organic residues, respectively. The performance of Co3O4&#8208;CeO2 nanocomposites was optimized by varying the Co3O4 loading, characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and N2 sorption (BET). The 16&#8208;65 wt% Co3O4&#8208;CeO2 catalysts approached the conversion of 1 wt% Pt/CeO2, rendering them interesting candidates for low temperature CO oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Direct Electrochemical Methanol Reforming Enabled by CO&#8208;Immune Mo&#8208;based Hydrogen Evolution Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen storage in the form of intermediate artificial fuels such as methanol is important for future chemical and energy applications, and the electrochemical regeneration of hydrogen from methanol is thermodynamically favorable compared to direct water splitting. However, CO produced from methanol oxidation can adsorb to H  2  evolution catalysts and drastically reduce catalyst activity. In this study, we report and explore the origins of CO immunity in Mo&#8208;containing H  2  evolution catalysts. Unlike conventional catalysts such as Pt or Ni, Mo&#8208;based catalysts display remarkable immunity to CO poisoning. The origin of this behavior in NiMo appears to arise from the apparent inability of CO to bind Mo in electrocatalytic conditions, with mechanistic consequences for the HER in these systems. This specific property of Mo&#8208;based HER catalysts makes them ideal in environments where poisons may be present.</dc:description>

         <title>Distorted Porphyrins with High Stability: Synthesis and Characteristic Electronic Properties of Mono&#8208; and Di&#8208;Nuclear Tricarbonyl Rhenium Tetraazaporphyrin Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mono&#8208; and di&#8208;nuclear tricarbonyl Re(I) tetraazaporphyrin complexes (  Re&#8321;TAP  and  Re&#8322;TAP  ) are investigated and compared with Re(I) phthalocyanine complexes (  Re&#8321;Pc  and  Re&#8322;Pc  ). Although  Re&#8322;Pc  is unstable in polar solvents, which easily undergoes demetallation reaction, the coordination of the TAP ligand significantly improves the tolerance toward polar solvents, affording more stability to  Re&#8322;TAP  . Additionally, the incorporation of [Re(CO)&#8323;]  +  unit(s) and the TAP ligand results in remarkable positive shifts in both oxidation and reduction potentials. Consequently, the more positive oxidation potentials of the ReTAP complexes significantly increase the tolerance toward oxidation, while the reduction potential indicates that  Re&#8322;TAP  is suitable for a soluble electron acceptor. In contrast to  Re&#8321;Pc  and  Re&#8322;Pc  ,  Re&#8321;TAP  and  Re&#8322;TAP  show unique broad Q bands, which can be attributed to the admixture of the &#960;&#8211;&#960;* and metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer characters, owing to the lowered &#960; orbital energy in the TAP complexes.&#160;This study is useful for controlling electronic properties and realizing high stability in Pc analogues.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mono&#8208; and di&#8208;nuclear tricarbonyl Re(I) tetraazaporphyrin complexes (  Re&#8321;TAP  and  Re&#8322;TAP  ) are investigated and compared with Re(I) phthalocyanine complexes (  Re&#8321;Pc  and  Re&#8322;Pc  ). Although  Re&#8322;Pc  is unstable in polar solvents, which easily undergoes demetallation reaction, the coordination of the TAP ligand significantly improves the tolerance toward polar solvents, affording more stability to  Re&#8322;TAP  .

         <title>Isolation of a Uranium(III)&#8208;Carbon Multiple Bond Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low&#8208;valent uranium&#8208;element multiple bond complexes are scarce, though there is burgeoning interest regarding to their bonding and reactivity. Herein, isolation of a uranium(III)&#8208;carbon double bond complex [(Cp*) 2 U(CDP)](BPh 4 ) ( 1 ) comprising a tridentate carbodiphosphorane (CDP) as ligand is reported for the first time. Oxidation of 1 afforded the corresponding U(IV) complex [(Cp*) 2 U(CDP)](BPh 4 ) 2 ( 2 ). The interatomic distance between U and C in 2 is 2.481 &#197;, indicating a typical U=C double bond, which is further confirmed by quantum chemical &#160; calculations. Bonding analysis suggests that the CDP ligand serves as both &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;donor in complex 1 where a longer U&#8208;C bond (2.666(3) &#197;) is observed. The results indicate that 1 is the first mononuclear uranium(III) carbene complex that could be isolated. These results suggest that CDPs are promising ligands to establish other low&#8208;valent f &#8208;block metal&#8208;carbon multiple bond complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Porous Tungsten Oxide: Recent Advances in Design, Synthesis&#160;and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tungsten oxide (WO3) has grown continuous attention and has been highly researched over the last decade credited to being a low&#8208;cost transition metal semiconductor with a tunable yet widely stable band gaps. This minireview briefly highlights design and synthesis&#160; challenges of porous WO3  &#160;including methods, precursors, solvents effects, crystal phase, and &#160;the surface activity of the porous WO3  base material. These topics are explored while also drawing a connection of how the morphology and crystal phase affect the band gap. The shifts in band gap not only impacts the optical properties of tungsten but also allows&#160; tuning to operate on different energy levels which makes WO3  highly desirable in many applications such as supercapacitors, batteries, solar cells, catalysts, sensors, smart windows, and bio&#8208;applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Click and Release Chemistry for Activity&#8208;Based Purification of &#946;&#8208;Lactam Targets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The problem of antibiotic resistance requires innovative strategies for the identification of drug targets and the characterization of the emerging mechanisms of resistance. This is the case for the highly diverse and complex targets of &#946;&#8208;lactams that include essential biosynthetic enzymes, the transpeptidases, unessential hydrolases involved in peptidoglycan metabolism, and unknown enzymes. The findings reported here should have important implications in this context, as they propose an activity&#8208;based purification method of &#946;&#8208;lactam targets based on click and release chemistry. More information can be found in the Full Paper by M. Arthur, M. Fonvielle, M. Etheve&#8208;Quelquejeu et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100653).

         <title>Transmembrane Transport of Bicarbonate Unravelled</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of synthetic bicarbonate transporters is of high interest for potential therapeutic applications. This work presents a new assay to study bicarbonate transport, based on a europium complex that is encapsulated inside liposomes and reports changes in the intravesicular concentration of bicarbonate in a direct and highly sensitive way. The assay revealed that transporters can act via different mechanisms, involving actual transport of HCO3&#8722; anions or passive diffusion of CO2. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Butler, H. Valkenier, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100491).

         <title>Metal Cation&#8208;Driven Dynamic Covalent Formation of Imine and Hydrazone Ligands Displaying Synergistic Co&#8208;catalysis and Auxiliary Amine Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imine and hydrazone formation is strongly driven by metal ions and the latter also displays a synergistic effect of both metal ions and an auxiliary amine. The rate acceleration occurs both in stoichiometric and catalytic conditions, displaying a true catalysis of imine and hydrazone formation. The synergistic metallo&#8208; and organo&#8208;catalysis relates to the construction of complex dynamic systems.







Abstract
Optimizing C=N bond formation and C/N component exchange has major significance in Dynamic Covalent Chemistry (DCC). Imine and hydrazone generation from their aldehyde, amine and hydrazine components showed large accelerations in presence of AgOTf or Zn(OTf)2, up to 104 for the Zn(II)&#8208;(p&#8208;anisidine)imine complex. Zn(OTf)2 and auxiliary p&#8208;anisidine together accelerated 630 times the formation of the Zn(II)&#8208;hydrazone complex, revealing a strong synergistic effect, traced to very fast initial formation of the reactive Zn(II)&#8208;imine complex presenting a C=N bond metallo&#8208;activated towards reaction with the hydrazine component. Reactions involving more entities showed kinetically faster and thermodynamically simpler outputs due to dynamic competition within a mixture of higher complexity. Catalytic amounts of metal salts and auxiliary amine gave similar marked rate accelerations and turnover, indicating true catalysis. The synergistic effect achieved by combining metallo&#8208; and organo&#8208;catalysis points to a powerful co&#8208;catalysis strategy of bond&#8208;formation in DCC through interconnected chemical transformations.

         <dc:description>The N&#8208;arylation of chiral amino acid esters with minimal racemization is a challenging transformation because of the sensitivity of the &#945;&#8208;stereocenter. We developed a versatile synthetic method to prepare N&#8208;arylated amino acid esters using cyclohexanones as aryl sources under continuous&#8208;flow conditions. The designed flow system, which consists of a coil reactor and a packed&#8208;bed reactor containing a Pd(OH)2/C catalyst, efficiently afforded the desired N&#8208;arylated amino acids without significant racemization, accompanied by only small amounts of easily removable co&#8208;products (i.e., H2O and alkanes). The efficiency and robustness of this method allowed for the continuous synthesis of the desired product in very high yield and enantiopurity with high space&#8208;time yield (74.1 g L&#8211;1 h&#8211;1) and turnover frequency (5.9 h&#8211;1) for at least 3 days.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel WS  2  /Fe  0.95  S  1.05  &#160;Hierarchical Nanosphere as a Highly Efficient Electrocatalyst for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Fe  0.95  S  1.05  &#160;with high reactivity and stability was incorporated into WS  2  &#160;nanosheets  via  &#160;a one&#8208;step hydrothermal method for the first time. The resulted hybrid catalyst has much higher catalytic activity than WS  2  &#160;and Fe  0.95  S  1.05  &#160;alone, and the optimal WS  2  /Fe  0.95  S  1.05  &#160;hybrid catalyst was found by adjusting the feed ratio. We proved that the addition of Fe  0.95  S  1.05  &#160;can enhance the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of WS  2  , and vice versa. At the same time, it was found that the catalytic effect of the hybrid catalyst was the best when the feed ratio was W:Fe=2:1. In other words, we confirmed that there is a synergistic effect between W&#8208; and Fe&#8208;based sulfide hybrid catalysts, and validated that the reason for the improved HER performance is the strong interaction between the two in the middle sulfur. WS  2  /Fe  0.95  S  1.05  &#160;hybrid catalyst leads to enhanced HER activity, which shows&#160;a low overpotential of ~&#160;0.172&#160;V at 10 mA&#160;cm  &#8208;  2  , low&#160;Tafel slope of ~&#160;53.47 mV/decade. This study supplies innovative synthesis of a highly active WS  2  /Fe  0.95  S  1.05  &#160;hybrid catalyst for HER.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Control of Peptide Conformation with Light and Metal&#8208;Coordination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the design of a stimuli&#8208;responsive peptide whose conformation is controlled by wavelength&#8208;specific light and metal coordination. The peptide adopts a defined tertiary structure whose conformation can be modulated between an &#945;&#8208;helical coiled coil and &#946;&#8208;sheet. The peptide is designed with a hydrophobic interface to induce coiled coil formation and is based on a recently described strategy to obtain switchable helix dimers. Here, we endowed the helix dimer with 8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline (HQ) groups to achieve metal coordination and a shift to a &#946;&#8208;sheet structure. We find that the conformational shift only occurs upon introduction of Zn  2+  . The other metal ions (Cu  2+  , Fe  3+  , Co  2+  , Mg  2+  and Ni  2+  ) do not offer switching likely due to non&#8208;specific metal&#8208;peptide coordination. A control peptide lacking the metal&#8208;coordinating residues does not show conformational switching with Zn  2+  supporting the role of this metal in stabilizing the &#946;&#8208;sheet conformation in a defined manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Accessing C2&#8208;Functionalized 1,3&#8208;(Benz)azolesthrough Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The skeletal presence of 1,3&#8208;azoles in a variety of bioactive natural products, pharmacophores, and organic materials demands the derivatization of such heteroarenes regioselectively. Plenty of cross&#8208;coupling as well as cyclocondensation reactions have been performed to build up these skeletons but remained commercially unrealizable. A couple of severe drawbacks are faced by these traditional protocols that require a more straightforward strategy to obviate them. Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H functionalization has emerged as a superior alternative in that context. 1,3&#8208;azoles and their benzo counterparts have been extensively functionalized exploiting both noble and earth&#8208;abundant transition metals. Lately, C&#8208;2 functionalizations have gained much traction due to the ease of attaining high regioselectivity and installation of synthetically manipulative functionalities. This critical review presents a bird's eye view of all major C&#8208;2 functionalizations of (benz)azoles catalyzed by a diverse set of metals performed over the past 15 years.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship for Di&#8208; up to Tetranuclear Macrocyclic Ruthenium Catalysts in Homogeneous Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have synthesized two di&#8208; and tetranuclear Ru(bda) (bda: 2,2'&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;6,6'&#8208;dicarboxylate) macrocyclic complexes and investigated their catalytic activities in chemical and photochemical water oxidation in a comparative manner to our previously reported trinuclear congener. Our studies have shown that the catalytic activities of this homologous series of multinuclear Ru(bda) macrocycles in homogeneous water oxidation are dependent on their size, exhibiting highest efficiencies for the largest tetranuclear catalyst. The turnover frequencies (TOFs) have increased from di&#8208; to tetranuclear macrocycles not only per catalyst molecule but more importantly also per Ru unit with TOF of 6 s&#8208;1 to 8.7 s&#8208;1 and 10.5 s&#8208;1 in chemical and 0.6 s&#8208;1 to 3.3 s&#8208;1 and 5.8 s&#8208;1 in photochemical water oxidation per Ru unit, respectively. Thus, for the first time, a clear structure&#8208;activity relationship could be established for this novel class of macrocyclic water oxidation catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>From BN Naphthalenes to Benzoborole Dianions</title>

         <dc:description>The synthesis of benzoborole polyanions by alkali metal reduction of BN&#8208;naphthalene derivatives via a ring&#8208;contraction strategy has been developed. Reduction of 1&#8208;alkynyl 2,1&#8208;benzazaborine 1a in Et2O led to the elimination of alkynyllithium with the formation of 1&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;benzoborole trilithium salt 2a, whereas reduction of 1&#8208;phenyl 2,1&#8208;benzazaborine 1c in THF yielded 1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1&#8208;benzoborole dilithium salt 2c with the elimination of ArNHLi. The trilithium and dilithium salts 2a and 2c have been fully characterized. Treatment of trilithium salt 2a with Et3NHCl led to the selective protonation of the amino lithium to afford the dilithium salt 2aH, which could be cleanly oxidized to 1&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;benzoborole 3 in excellent yield. Reaction of 1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1&#8208;benzoborole dilithium salt 2c with MeI yielded the lithium borate 4c, which is luminescent both in solution and in the solid state.</dc:description>

         <title>Beyond the Isoprene Pattern: Bifunctional Polyene Cyclizations</title>

Bifunctional polyene cyclizations take advantage of the unique reactivity of higher&#8208;functionalized alkenes in contrast to the common isoprene&#8208;based polyenes. The potential of these systems is highlighted by the synthesis of structurally complex polycycles involving unprecedented cyclization pathways.







Abstract
Polyene cyclizations are capable of producing molecular complexity in a single step. While classical systems are limited to simple alkyl substitution patterns only, bifunctional polyenes take advantage of the unique reactivity of higher&#8208;functionalized alkenes. Here, we highlight the potential of these variants for the synthesis of structurally complex polycycles involving unprecedented termination steps. We also want to provide a stimulus for the development of novel modes of cyclization that involve bifunctional units to enable efficient synthesis of yet inaccessible natural products.

         <title>Directing Polymorphism in the Helical Nanofilament Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 24, Page 7108-7113, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Morphogenesis control: the morphogenesis of the helical nanofilament (HNF) liquid&#8208;crystal phase was controlled to give structures that depend on the growth conditions. Two different growth methods were used to investigate the polymorphism of HNFs: nanoconfinement and light&#8208;driven orientation. This is apparently the first report on the polymorphism of an HNF phase formed by single kind of molecules.







Abstract
Herein, it is reported that the polymorphism in the helical nanofilament (HNF, B4) liquid&#8208;crystalline phase depends on the fabrication methods, that is, UV&#8208;driven formation and template&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly in the nanoconfined geometry. As a result, uniaxially oriented HNFs with different helical structures were obtained, in which generation of the twisted&#8208;ribbon and cylindrical&#8208;ribbon polymorphs showed that even the molecular lattice has a different orientation. The detailed structures were directly observed by SEM and grazing&#8208;incidence X&#8208;ray diffraction with synchrotron radiation. The resultant polymorphs could be used in chiro&#8208;optical applications due to the capability for fine control of the helical structures.

         <title>A Nickel(II)&#8208;Mediated Thiocarbonylation Strategy for Carbon Isotope Labeling of Aliphatic Carboxamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 24, Page 7114-7123, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The faster the better: Rapid nickel(II)&#8208;mediated thiocarbonylation of alkyl zinc reagents provides an expedient route to activated esters, which can subsequently be exploited for the direct synthesis of aliphatic carboxamides. This process is highly adaptable to carbon isotope labeling, which was illustrated for the synthesis of 13C&#8208;labeled low molecular weight drugs and biopharmaceuticals.







Abstract
A series of pharmaceutically relevant small molecules and biopharmaceuticals bearing aliphatic carboxamides have been successfully labeled with carbon&#8208;13. Key to the success of this novel carbon isotope labeling technique is the observation that 13C&#8208;labeled NiII&#8208;acyl complexes, formed from a 13CO insertion step with NiII&#8208;alkyl intermediates, rapidly react in less than one minute with 2,2&#8217;&#8208;dipyridyl disulfide to quantitatively form the corresponding 2&#8208;pyridyl thioesters. Either the use of 13C&#8208;SilaCOgen or 13C&#8208;COgen allows for the stoichiometric addition of isotopically labeled carbon monoxide. Subsequent one&#8208;pot acylation of a series of structurally diverse amines provides the desired 13C&#8208;labeled carboxamides in good yields. A single electron transfer pathway is proposed between the NiII&#8208;acyl complexes and the disulfide providing a reactive NiIII&#8208;acyl sulfide intermediate, which rapidly undergoes reductive elimination to the desired thioester. By further optimization of the reaction parameters, reaction times down to only 11&#8197;min were identified, opening up the possibility of exploring this chemistry for carbon&#8208;11 isotope labeling. Finally, this isotope labeling strategy could be adapted to the synthesis of 13C&#8208;labeled liraglutide and insulin degludec, representing two antidiabetic drugs.

Gold (I)&#8208;catalyzed higher&#8208;order cycloaddition: 8&#8208;Aryl&#8208;8&#8208;azafulvenes undergo a regioselective gold catalyzed [8+2] cycloaddition with electron&#8208;rich allenamines and ynamides to give dihydrocyclohepta[b]pyrrole derivatives. The cyclization takes place after the nucleophilic attack of the heptafulvene to the electrophilic intermediates formed by the coordination of cationic gold to either allene or triple bond moieties of the unsaturated systems.







Abstract
Gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed higher&#8208;order [8+2] cycloadditions of 8&#8208;aryl&#8208;8&#8208;azaheptafulvenes 1 with allenamides 2 and ynamides 3 were studied. 1,8&#8208;Dihydrocycloheptapyrroles 4 were achieved by a regioselective [8+2] cycloaddition of azaheptafulvenes 1 and allenamides 2 in the presence of (2,4&#8208;ditBuC6H3O)3PAuNTf2 as catalyst. Besides, ynamides 3 and 8&#8208;aryl&#8208;8&#8208;azaheptafulvenes 1, undergo a regioselective [8+2] cycloaddition, to give 2&#8208;amido&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydrocycloheptapyrroles 7 in the presence of JohnPhosAuNTf2 as catalyst. Both reactions take place with good yields and with a variety of substituents. A plausible mechanism hypothesis suggests a nucleophilic attack of the 8&#8208;azaheptafulvene to the gold activated electron rich allene or alkyne moieties of the allenamide and ynamide, respectively.

         <title>Co&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Intramolecular [3+2] Cycloaddition of Yne&#8208;Alkylidenecyclopropanes and its Reaction Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 24, Page 7176-7182, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Co&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric intramolecular [3+2] reaction of yne&#8208;alkylidenecyclopropanes (yne&#8208;ACPs) using a commercially available ligand has been realized for the synthesis of 5/5 and 6/5 bicycles. This reaction avoids the use of precious Pd and Rh catalysts usually used for these reactions. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction takes places via oxidative cyclometallation of the alkyne and the ACP, ring opening of the cyclopropyl group, and reductive elimination.







Abstract
Developing new transition metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cycloadditions for the synthesis of five&#8208;membered carbocycles (FMCs) is a research frontier in reaction development due to the ubiquitous presence of chiral FMCs in various functional molecules.

     alt="Co&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Intramolecular [3+2] Cycloaddition of Yne&#8208;Alkylidenecyclopropanes and its Reaction Mechanism"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The first Co&#8208;catalyzed&lt;/b&gt; asymmetric intramolecular [3+2] reaction of yne&#8208;alkylidenecyclopropanes (yne&#8208;ACPs) using a commercially available ligand has been realized for the synthesis of 5/5 and 6/5 bicycles. This reaction avoids the use of precious Pd and Rh catalysts usually used for these reactions. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction takes places via oxidative cyclometallation of the alkyne and the ACP, ring opening of the cyclopropyl group, and reductive elimination.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing new transition metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cycloadditions for the synthesis of five&#8208;membered carbocycles (FMCs) is a research frontier in reaction development due to the ubiquitous presence of chiral FMCs in various functional molecules. Reported here is our discovery of a highly enantioselective intramolecular [3+2] cycloaddition of yne&#8208;alkylidenecyclopropanes (yne&#8208;ACPs) to bicyclo[3.3.0]octadiene and bicyclo[4.3.0]nonadiene molecules using a cheap Co catalyst and commercially available chiral ligand (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;Xyl&#8208;BINAP. This reaction avoids the use of precious Pd and Rh catalysts, which are usually the choices for [3+2] reactions with ACPs. The enantiomeric excess in the present reaction can be up to 92&#8201;%. Cationic cobalt(I) species was suggested by experiments as the catalytic species. DFT calculations showed that this [3+2] reaction starts with oxidative cyclometallation of alkyne and ACP, followed by ring opening of the cyclopropyl (CP) group and reductive elimination to form the cycloadduct. This mechanism is different from previous [3+2] reactions of ACPs, which usually start from CP cleavage, not from oxidative cyclization.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Temperature Dependence of 1H Paramagnetic Chemical Shifts in Actinide Complexes, Beyond Bleaney's Theory: The AnVIO22+&#8211;Dipicolinic Acid Complexes (An=Np, Pu) as an Example</title>

NMR spectroscopy: The temperature dependence of paramagnetic 1H NMR chemical shifts are measured and modelled in the AnVIO22+&#8211;dipicolinic acid complexes. Only the pseudocontact term is non&#8208;zero. The magnetic susceptibility tensor, the energy states and magnetic moments of the paramagnetic center are deduced and compared to the SO&#8208;CASPT2 values.







Abstract
Actinide +VI complexes (
=
, 
 and 
) with dipicolinic acid derivatives were synthesized and characterized by powder XRD, SQUID magnetometry and NMR spectroscopy. In addition, 
 and 
 complexes were described by first principles CAS based and two&#8208;component spin&#8208;restricted DFT methods. The analysis of the 1H paramagnetic NMR chemical shifts for all protons of the ligands according to the X&#8208;rays structures shows that the Fermi contact contribution is negligible in agreement with spin density determined by unrestricted DFT. The magnetic susceptibility tensor is determined by combining SQUID, pNMR shifts and Evans&#8217; method. The SO&#8208;RASPT2 results fit well the experimental magnetic susceptibility and pNMR chemical shifts. The role of the counterions in the solid phase is pointed out; their presence impacts the magnetic properties of the 
 complex. The temperature dependence of the pNMR chemical shifts has a strong 
 contribution, contrarily to Bleaney's theory for lanthanide complexes. The fitting of the temperature dependence of the pNMR chemical shifts and SQUID magnetic susceptibility by a two&#8208;Kramers&#8208;doublet model for the 
 complex and a non&#8208;Kramers&#8208;doublet model for the 
 complex allows for the experimental evaluation of energy gaps and magnetic moments of the paramagnetic center.

         <title>A DNA&#8208;Encoded Chemical Library Based on Peptide Macrocycles</title>

A DNA&#8208;encoded chemical library (DEL) based on canonical and non&#8208;canonical peptide macrocycles (YO&#8208;DEL) was generated. The single&#8208;stranded format allowed for selections by affinity capture, through a novel selection method exploiting the competition with an antibody fragment and the annealing to a photoreactive moiety which allowed for selections by a photocrosslinking approach. The YO&#8208;DEL yielded ligands against proteins of pharmaceutical interest such as CAIX, HSA and NKp46, a protein expressed on the surface of activated NK&#8208;cells.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of a novel DNA&#8208;encoded library of macrocyclic peptide derivatives are described; the macrocycles are based on three sets of proteinogenic and non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acid building blocks and featuring the use of copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction for ring closure. The library (termed YO&#8208;DEL) which contains 1&#8201;254&#8201;838 compounds, was encoded with DNA in single&#8208;stranded format and was screened against target proteins of interest using affinity capture procedures and photocrosslinking. YO&#8208;DEL selections yielded specific binders against serum albumins, carbonic anhydrases and NKp46, a marker of activated Natural Killer cells.

         <title>Novel Ferrocene&#8208;Appended &#946;&#8208;Ketoimines and Related BF2 Derivatives with Significant Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission and Second&#8208;Order Nonlinear Optical Properties</title>

Strong candidates! The synthesis and structural characterization of ferrocene&#8208;appended &#946;&#8208;ketoimines and their BF2 complexes is reported. A study of their photophysical properties revealed that both the &#946;&#8208;ketoimines and their BF2 complexes show aggregation&#8208;induced emission and a strong second&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) response, and thus are excellent multifunctional candidates for NLO and luminescence applications.







Abstract
A series of new &#946;&#8208;ketoimines containing a ferrocene moiety and their BF2 complexes have been synthesized and structurally characterized. The solvatochromism of the &#946;&#8208;ketoimines was studied, putting in evidence a redshift with increasing solvent polarity. This positive solvatochromism can be attributed to a more polarized excited state compared with the ground state, due to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transitions. The &#946;&#8208;ketoimines exhibited weak emission, attributable to the excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) phenomenon. This ESIPT effect is suppressed upon restriction of the keto&#8208;enamine tautomerism, induced upon addition of BF3&#8901;OEt2, which afforded the related BF2 complexes, characterized by an enhancement of the fluorescence through the ICT effect. Both the &#946;&#8208;ketoimines and BF2 complexes exhibited significant aggregation&#8208;induced emission behavior in mixtures of CH3CN/H2O, due to restriction of intramolecular rotation in the aggregated state. The frontier molecular orbital levels, ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state dipole moments (&#956;g and &#956;e), and the origin of electronic absorption spectra were studied by time&#8208;dependent DFT calculations. The second&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) properties were determined by the electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced second&#8208;harmonic generation technique. The &#956;&#946;1907 values of the &#946;&#8208;ketoimines increased upon the formation of the related BF2 complexes, mainly due to an enhancement of the ground&#8208;state dipole moment. The results presented here reveal that some of these novel compounds are excellent multifunctional candidates for NLO and luminescence applications.

This work reports on a method that uses aryl(Mes)iodonium salts as an aryne precursor via regioselective deprotonation. Various arynophiles are used and result in formation of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;Cl, and C&#8722;Si bonds; mechanistic insights from experiments and DFT calculations are provided.







Abstract
Herein, the synthesis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted benzenoid rings, motifs found in pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and natural products, is described.[1] In the past, the regioselective syntheses of such compounds have been a significant challenge. This work reports a method using substituted arynes derived from aryl(Mes)iodonium salts to access a range of densely functionalized 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted benzenoid rings. Significantly, it was found that halide substituents are compatible under these conditions, enabling post&#8208;synthetic elaboration via palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling. This concise strategy is predicated on two regioselective events: 1)&#8197;ortho&#8208; deprotonation of aryl(Mes)iodonium salts to generate a substituted aryne intermediate, and 2)&#8197;regioselective trapping of said arynes, thereby improving previously reported reaction conditions to generate arynes at room temperature and in shorter reaction times. Density functional theory (DFT) computations and linear free energy relationship (LFER) analysis suggest the regioselectivity of deprotonation is influenced by both proximal and distal ring substituents on the aryne precursor. A competition experiment further reveals the role of arene substituents on relative reactivity of aryl(Mes)iodoniums as aryne precursors.

         <title>Front Cover: High&#8208;pressure Nucleation of Low&#8208;Density Polymorphs (Chem. Eur. J. 24/2021)</title>

         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;density polymorphs obtained in a high&#8208;pressure environment are reported in this work. The single crystals were grown by the kinetic crystallization of the seeds precipitated in high&#8208;entropy conditions, owing to the extreme temperature and pressure in the confined space. This simple and inexpensive method opens a colorful palette of polymorphic forms inaccessible with traditional methods. More information can be found in the Full Paper by A.&#8197;Katrusiak et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202005121).

         <title>Cover Feature: Directing Polymorphism in the Helical Nanofilament Phase (Chem. Eur. J. 24/2021)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 24, Page 6996-6996, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymorphism is defined as the formation of more than two kinds of crystal structures from a single compound, which is essential for practical applications such as pharmaceuticals and agriculture. Stimuli&#8208;responsive polymorphism of the helical nanofilament (HNF) is investigated by using light&#8208;driven and nanoconfinement methods. The light&#8208;driven HNFs form the twisted ribbons, while the nanoconfined HNFs show the cylindrical ribbons. The discovery of polymorphism on HNF structures will provide insights for future studies on chirality. More information can be found in the Full Paper by D.&#8197;K. Yoon et&#8197;al. on page 7108.

         <dc:description>
The review article presented by T.&#8197;B. Marder et&#8197;al. on page 7043, summarizes the synthetic developments that have been made in the synthesis of triarylboranes throughout the years from their first appearance in 1885 to the present. It is shown that, over time, developments in other fields of research enriched triarylborane chemistry by developing new organometallic reagents or boron sources, which led to new synthetic strategies and opened the door for diverse applications. Investigation of reactivities and other molecular properties of triarylboranes led to the first commercially available products by the middle of the 20th century. With increasing interest in this field of research, new potential applications of such compounds continue to arise. This review article aims to provide guidance for researchers to find the best synthetic strategy for preparing new compounds containing the triarylborane motif.

         <title>Frontispiece: Chiral Triptycenes: Concepts, Progress and Prospects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 24, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The journey of chiral triptycenes started in 1962 with their first synthesis. Until 1984 several chiral triptycene derivatives were synthesized and their optical properties studied in relation to the substituted functional groups including the determination of their absolute configurations. Afterwards, a huge gap of almost 30 years remained in the development of chiral triptycenes. Only in 2014, chiral triptycenes caught again the attention of researchers when research based on chiral triptycenes applied to the synthesis of chiral materials was published. This work brought the almost forgotten chiral triptycenes back to the limelight. This Minireview describes the initial history of developments of chiral triptycenes and their comeback to important applications in advanced materials and catalysis after a research gap of almost 30 years. For more information, see the Minireview by T. Wirth et&#8197;al. on page 7059.

In s&#8211;p hybridization, the contraction of C&#8722;H and C&#8722;C bonds as the carbon atom involved varies from sp3 to sp2 to sp is a fundamental and ubiquitous phenomenon in chemistry. Using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum chemical computations, this work uncovers that these bonds do not contract due to the increasing percentage of s&#8208;character of the hybrid orbital at the pertinent carbon, as is commonly accepted, but, instead, because the steric congestion around this carbon atom decreases as the coordination number goes from 4 to 3 to 2 for sp3 to sp2 to sp, respectively. More information can be found in the Communication by F.&#8197;M. Bickelhaupt et&#8197;al. on page 7074.

         <title>Half&#8208;Integer Spin Triangles: Old Dogs, New Tricks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 24, Page 7022-7042, April 26, 2021. </description>

Triangular tricks: In architecture, relief triangles relieve the stress of the superstructure by distributing it away from the weak points of the underlying wall. In magnetism, spin triangles relieve the stress of competing interactions by distributing local magnetizations to minimize energy. Architectural examples, like the &#8220;Lion gate&#8221; in Mycenae, are extremely ancient, but spin triangles are slowly catching up.







Abstract
Spin triangles, that is, triangular complexes of half&#8208;integer spins, are the oldest molecular nanomagnets (MNMs). Their magnetic properties have been studied long before molecular magnetism was delineated as a research field. This Review presents the history of their study, with references to the parallel development of new experimental investigations and new theoretical ideas used for their interpretation. It then presents an indicative list of spin&#8208;triangle families to illustrate their chemical diversity. Finally, it makes reference to recent developments in terms of theoretical ideas and new phenomena, as well as to the relevance of spin triangles to spintronic devices and new physics.

         <title>Synthetic Approaches to Triarylboranes from 1885 to 2020</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 24, Page 7043-7058, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents a history of the methods used to synthesize triarylboranes, which are an interesting class of electron&#8208;poor compounds with a wide range of useful properties and applications as Lewis acids, frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) catalysts, electron transporters, luminescent chromophores for OLEDs, anion sensors, and bioimaging agents, among others.







Abstract
In recent years, research in the fields of optoelectronics, anion sensors and bioimaging agents have been greatly influenced by novel compounds containing triarylborane motifs. Such compounds possess an empty p&#8208;orbital at boron which results in useful optical and electronic properties. Such a diversity of applications was not expected when the first triarylborane was reported in 1885. Synthetic approaches to triarylboranes underwent various changes over the following century, some of which are still used in the present day, such as the generally applicable routes developed by Krause et&#8197;al. in 1922, or by Grisdale et&#8197;al. in 1972 at Eastman Kodak. Some other developments were not pursued further after their initial reports, such as the synthesis of two triarylboranes bearing three different aromatic groups by Mikhailov et&#8197;al. in 1958. This review summarizes the development of synthetic approaches to triarylboranes from their first report nearly 135 years ago to the present.

From basics to advanced: Chirality in triptycenes due to atropisomerism and stereocenters have been reviewed and the routes to obtain these chiral triptycenes have been highlighted. This Minireview describes the initial history of developments of chiral triptycenes and its comeback to important applications in advanced materials and catalysis after a gap of almost 30 years.







Abstract
Triptycenes have been established as unique scaffolds because of their backbone &#960;&#8208;structure with a propeller&#8208;like shape and saddle&#8208;like cavities. They are some of the key organic molecules that have been extensively studied in polymer chemistry, in supramolecular chemistry and in material science. Triptycenes become chiral molecules when substituents are unsymmetrically attached in at least two of their different aromatic rings. This Minireview highlights the chirality of triptycenes from basics to an advanced stage for the development of functional molecules.

         <title>On the Structural Assignments Underlying R.&#8197;B. Woodward's Most Personal Data That Led to the Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann Rules: Subramania Ranganathan's Key Role and Related Research by E.&#8197;J. Corey and A.&#8197;G. Hortmann</title>

In 1963 and early 1964, R. B. Woodward and his postdoctoral student Subramania Ranganathan discovered a route&#8208;ending glitch in the isoxazole route to vitamin B12. However, they simultaneously discovered two coupled pairs of stereospecific valence isomerizations that became Woodward's 5th mysterious reaction and led to the Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann rules. This Essay discusses the behind&#8208;the&#8208;scenes story of Ranganathan's research and confirms his structure determinations using quantum chemical calculations of 1H&#8197;NMR parameters.







Abstract
In the early 1960s, as part of R. B. Woodward's isoxazole route to vitamin B12, Subramania Ranganathan uncovered two coupled sets of stereospecific reactions, a thermal set and a photochemical set. These four reactions illustrated the alternating configurations that were the major data points that prompted the solution of the no&#8208;mechanism problem. Though Ranganathan's reactions played a major role, according to Woodward, in the development of the Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann rules, they were published only as part of the documentation of a lecture given by Woodward in 1966. The authors of this paper have uncovered Subramania Ranganathan's 1964 postdoctoral report and have used modern quantum chemical theory to predict the 1H&#8197;NMR spectra for Ranganathan's key compounds, providing support for the structure assignments made by Woodward and Ranganathan. A similar set of alternating, stereospecific reactions was observed by E.&#8197;J. Corey and Alfred Hortmann in their 1963 total synthesis of dihydrocostunolide. We also have applied the computational process used for Ranganathan's compounds to Hortmann's compounds, now also including the calculation of coupling constants, and find computational support for Corey and Hortmann's structure assignments.

         <title>High&#8208;pressure Nucleation of Low&#8208;Density Polymorphs**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 24, Page 7069-7073, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy nucleation and subsequent crystallization performed under high&#8208;pressure and high&#8208;temperature conditions lead to kinetic polymorphs of aryl disulfides, characterized by lower symmetry, higher Z&#8217; number and lower density than the ambient&#8208;pressure polymorphs.







Abstract
New polymorphs &#946; and &#947; of bis&#8208;3&#8208;nitrophenyl disulphide, crystallized above 0.3&#8197;GPa, are less dense than the ambient&#8208;pressure polymorph &#945;. This counterintuitive density relation results from the high&#8208;entropy nucleation and subsequent kinetic crystallization. The work performed by pressure compensates the high entropy and temperature product, substantiated in varied conformers and increased chemical potential. Pressure&#8208;increased viscosity promotes the kinetic polymorphs, in accordance with empirical Ostwald's rule of stages. It contrasts to mechanochemical techniques, favouring high&#8208;density polymorphs.

A flash chromatography column free and transition metal free cyanation of &#945; C&#8722;H sulfonylamide was developed to access valuable &#945;&#8208;amino cyanation products from a variety of fluorine masked sulfonylamides. Compared with Strecker reaction, this transformation offers a complementary strategy to efficiently construct &#945;&#8208;amino cyanides from direct &#945; C&#8722;H functionalization of sulfonylamindes. The reaction has a broad substrate scope and occurs under mild conditions. More importantly, the new two&#8208;electron allows for excellent &#945; site&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
This report describes the site&#8208;selective &#945;&#8208;functionalization of sulfonylamide derivatives through the in&#8208;situ generation of imine intermediates. The N&#8722;F sulfonylamides, which could facilitate the elimination to generate imines, are coupled with TBACN to efficiently and mildly afford &#945;&#8208;amino cyanides. Comparing with Strecker reaction, this transformation offers a complementary strategy to efficiently construct &#945;&#8208;amino cyanides from direct &#945; C&#8722;H functionalization of sulfonylamindes. The reaction is also characterized by broad substrate scope and flash chromatography column free workup. More importantly, the new two&#8208;electron pathway to generate imines through manipulation of the leaving group allows us to achieve excellent &#945; site&#8208;selectivity.

         <title>Not Carbon s&#8211;p Hybridization, but Coordination Number Determines C&#8722;H and C&#8722;C Bond Length</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 24, Page 7074-7079, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A paradigm shift! Our quantum chemical analyses reveal that, for example, C&#8722;H bonds along ethane, ethylene, and acetylene, do not contract due to the changing s&#8211;p hybridization of the pertinent carbon atom from sp3 to sp2 to sp but, instead, because the steric congestion around this carbon atom decreases as the coordination number goes from 4 to 3 to 2.







Abstract
A fundamental and ubiquitous phenomenon in chemistry is the contraction of both C&#8722;H and C&#8722;C bonds as the carbon atoms involved vary, in s&#8211;p hybridization, along sp3 to sp2 to sp. Our quantum chemical bonding analyses based on Kohn&#8211;Sham molecular orbital theory show that the generally accepted rationale behind this trend is incorrect. Inspection of the molecular orbitals and their corresponding orbital overlaps reveals that the above&#8208;mentioned shortening in C&#8722;H and C&#8722;C bonds is not determined by an increasing amount of s&#8208;character at the carbon atom in these bonds. Instead, we establish that this structural trend is caused by a diminishing steric (Pauli) repulsion between substituents around the pertinent carbon atom, as the coordination number decreases along sp3 to sp2 to sp.

Multicomponent dynagels for heparin encapsulation: Dynamic covalently cross&#8208;linked dynamers with high mechanical strength, biocompatibility and self&#8208;healing behaviors have been used for biomedical applications.







Abstract
Double cross&#8208;linked dynamic hydrogels, dynagels, have been prepared through reversible imine bonds and supramolecular interactions, which showed good pH responsiveness, injectability, self&#8208;healing property and biocompatibility. With the further encapsulation of heparin, the obtained hydrogels exhibited good anti&#8208;bacterial activity and promotion effects for 3D cell culture.

New visible&#8208;light&#8208;excitable solvatochromic fluorescent label for light&#8208;up and colour&#8208;change sensing of DNA&#8208;protein interactions.







Abstract
The synthesis of 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxycytidine and its 5&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;triphosphate bearing solvatochromic acetophenyl&#8208;thienyl&#8208;aniline fluorophore was developed using the Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reaction as the key step. The triphosphate was used for polymerase synthesis of labelled DNA. The labelled nucleotide or DNA exerted weak red fluorescence when excited at 405&#8197;nm, but a significant colour change (to yellow or green) and light&#8208;up (up to 20 times) was observed when the DNA probes interacted with proteins or lipids.

         <title>Synthesis of Desepoxy&#8208;Tedanolide C</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 24, Page 7085-7089, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total synthesis of one isomer of the marine natural product tedanolide C was accomplished and provides evidence about the relative configuration of this member of the tedanolide family. The synthesis takes advantage of a variant of the Kiyooka aldol protocol for the stereoselective synthesis of the tertiary alcohol flanked by three additional oxygenated carbon atoms. The synthesis was particularly sensitive to the appropriate selection of protecting groups, which made constant protecting group switches necessary. The spectroscopic data of the synthesized isomer support a different configuration than the originally proposed one.







Abstract
The synthesis of desepoxy&#8208;tedanolide C was accomplished and provided experimental evidence on the configuration of tedanolide C. The reported chemical shifts and coupling constants point to a configuration different from the published structure and analogous to the structures of the other members of this family of natural products. The key step is a Kiyooka aldol protocol for the stereoselective synthesis of the tertiary alcohol flanked by three additional oxygenated carbon atoms. Furthermore, two additional aldol reactions and a Julia&#8211;Kocienski olefination were used to assemble the carbon framework.

Chemical synthesis of a Kdo&#8208;containing rhamnogalacturonan II pentasaccharide was achieved by a [4+1] post&#8208;glycosylation oxidation approach.







Abstract
The synthesis of a fully deprotected Kdo&#8208;containing rhamnogalacturonan II pentasaccharide is described. The strategy relies on the preparation of a suitably protected homogalacturonan tetrasaccharide backbone, through a post&#8208;glycosylation oxidation approach, and its stereoselective glycosylation with a Kdo fluoride donor.

         <title>Photoresponsive Binding Dynamics in High&#8208;Affinity Cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;Dithienylethene Host&#8208;Guest Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of external stimuli to control the binding kinetics in supramolecular systems is of critical importance for the development of advanced molecular machines and devices. In this work we report a study focused on the kinetics of a water&#8208;soluble host&#8208;guest system based on cucurbit[8]uril and two dithienylethene (DTE) photoswitches. We show that for the DTE guest comprising two anionic sulfonate side arms appended to pyridinium moieties, the formation/dissociation of the pseudorotaxane structures is slowed down by more than 100000&#8208;fold with respect to its bipyridinium analogue. The decrease in ingression rate leads to the emergence of a competitive metastable product with the open DTE isomer that has an important influence in the overall binding kinetics. We also demonstrate that host&#8208;guest dissociation kinetics is approximately 100&#8208;fold slower for the closed DTE isomer (t  1/2  = 107 hours vs t  1/2  = 1.2 hours for the open isomer) allowing control over the dissociation rate with light.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural, Magnetic and Catalytic Properties of a New Vacancy Ordered Perovskite Type Barium Cobaltate BaCoO2.67</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new vacancy ordered, anion deficient perovskite modification with composition of BaCoO  2.67  (Ba  3  Co  3  O  8  &#9633;  1  ) has been prepared via a two&#8208;step heating process. Combined Rietveld analysis of neutron and X&#8208;ray powder diffraction data shows a novel ordering of oxygen vacancies not known before for barium cobaltates. A combination of neutron powder diffraction, magnetic measurements and density functional theory (DFT) studies confirms G&#8208;type antiferromagnetic ordering. From impedance measurements, the electronic conductivity of the order of 10  &#8722;4  S cm  &#8722;1  is determined. Remarkably, the bifunctional catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is found to be comparable to that of Ba  0.5  Sr  0.5  Co  0.8  Fe  0.2  O  3&#8722;  y  , confirming that charge&#8208;ordered anion deficient non&#8208;cubic perovskites can be highly efficient catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable Production of Ambient Stable Hybrid Bismuth&#8208;based Materials: AACVD of Phenethylammonium Bismuth Iodide Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Large homogeneous and adherent coatings of phenethylammonium bismuth iodide were produced using the cost&#8208;effective and scalable aerosol&#8208;assisted chemical vapour deposition (AACVD) methodology. The film morphology was found to depend on the deposition conditions and substrates, resulting in different optical properties to those reported from their spin&#8208;coated counterparts. Optoelectronic characterization revealed band bending effects occurring between the hybrid material and semiconducting substrates (TiO2 and FTO) due to heterojunction formation, and the optical bandgap of the hybrid material was calculated from UV&#8208;visible and PL spectrometry to be 2.05 eV. Maximum values for hydrophobicity and crystallographic preferential orientation were observed for films deposited on FTO/glass substrates, closely followed by values from films deposited on TiO2/glass substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Experimental and Computational Models for Side Chain Discrimination in Peptide&#8208;Protein Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A bis(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6) Tr&#246;ger's base receptor and 4&#8208;substituted hepta&#8208;1,7&#8208;diyl bisammonium salt ligands have been used as a model system to study the interactions between non&#8208;polar side chains of peptides and an aromatic cavity of a protein. NMR titrations and NOESY/ROESY NMR spectroscopy were used to analyze the discrimination of the ligands by the receptor based on the substituent of the ligand, both quantitatively (free binding energies) and qualitatively (conformations). The analysis showed that an all&#8208;anti conformation of the heptane chain was preferred for most of the ligands, both free and when bound to the receptor, and that for all of the receptor&#8208;ligand complexes, the substituent was located inside or partly inside of the aromatic cavity of the receptor. We estimated the free binding energy of a methyl&#8208; and a phenyl group to an aromatic cavity, via CH&#8208;&#960;, and combined aromatic CH&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions to be &#8722;1.7 and &#8722;3.3 kJ mol&#8722;1, respectively. The experimental results were used to assess the accuracy of different computational methods, including molecular mechanics (MM) and density functional theory (DFT) methods, showing that MM was superior.</dc:description>

         <title>Mn3&#8208;xFexO4 Hollow Nanostructures for High&#8208;Performance Asymmetric Supercapacitor Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Design of hollow nanostructure and controllable phase of mixed metal oxides for improving performance in supercapacitor applications is highly desirable. Here we demonstrate the rational design and synthesis of Mn  3&#8208;x  Fe  x  O  4  hollow nanostructures for supercapacitor applications. Owing to high porosity and the specific surface area that provides more active sites for electrochemical reactions, the electrochemical performance of Mn  3&#8208;x  Fe  x  O  4  hollow nanostructure substantially enhances comparing with pristine Mn  3  O  4  . Particularly, in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, Mn  0.16  Fe  2.84  O  4  with a typical diameter of 20 nm exhibits excellent specific capacitance of 2675, 2320, 1662, 987 Fg  &#8208;1  at current densities of 1, 2, 5, 10 Ag  &#8208;1  , respectively, which is significantly superior to those of other transition metal oxides. Besides, an asymmetric supercapacitor is assembled by using Mn  0.16  Fe  2.84  O  4  and activated carbon as a positive and a negative electrode, respectively. Electrochemical results indicate a high energy density of 42 Wh kg  &#8208;1  at a power density of 0.75 kW kg  &#8208;1  , which makes this hollow nanostructure a highly promising electrode for achieving high&#8208;performance next&#8208;generation supercapacitors.</dc:description>

         <title>Accessing Improbable Foldamer Shapes with Strained Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The alkylation of some secondary amide functions with a dimethoxybenzyl (DMB) group in oligomers of 8&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;quinolinecarboxylic acid destabilizes the otherwise favored helical conformations, and allows for cyclization to take place. A cyclic hexamer and a cyclic heptamer were produced in this manner. After DMB removal, X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR show that the macrocycles adopt strained conformations that would be improbable in non&#8208;cyclic species. The high helix folding propensity of the main chain is partly expressed in these conformations, but it remains frustrated by macrocyclization. Despite being homomeric, the macrocycles possess inequivalent monomer units. Experimental and computational studies highlight specific fluxional pathways within these structures. Extensive simulated annealing molecular dynamics allow for the prediction of the conformations for larger macrocycles with up to sixteen monomers.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries: Hydrazide as a Pluripotent Precursor for On&#8208;DNA Synthesis of Various Azole Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phylogenic chemical transformation approach to synthesize on&#8208;DNA 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazole, 1,3,4&#8208;thiadiazol&#8208;2&#8208;amine and 1,2,4&#8208;triazole derivatives using DNA&#8208;conjugated benzoyl hydrazine as pluripotent precursor are reported here, which shows great potential in facilitating rapid construction of azole&#8208;focused DELs.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;encoded combinatorial chemical library (DEL) technology, an approach that combines the power of genetics and chemistry, has emerged as an invaluable tool in drug discovery. Skeletal diversity plays a fundamental importance in DEL applications, and relies heavily on novel DNA&#8208;compatible chemical reactions. We report herein a phylogenic chemical transformation strategy using DNA&#8208;conjugated benzoyl hydrazine as a common versatile precursor in azole chemical expansion of DELs. DNA&#8208;compatible reactions deriving from the common benzoyl hydrazine precursor showed excellent functional group tolerance with exceptional efficiency in the synthesis of various azoles, including oxadiazoles, thiadiazoles, and triazoles, under mild reaction conditions. The phylogenic chemical transformation strategy provides DELs a facile way to expand into various unique chemical spaces with privileged scaffolds and pharmacophores.

         <title>Crystallization Induced Self&#8208;Assembly: A Strategy to Achieve Ultra&#8208;Small Domain Sizes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lamellar morphologies with ultra&#8208;small domain sizes (down to 3&#8197;nm) are achieved by the self&#8208;assembly of giant molecules. The driven force for the phase separation is attributed to the strong tendency and fast kinetics for crystallization of vinyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (VPOSS) segment. Upon the gamma ray radiation followed pyrolysis, ultra&#8208;thin two dimensional nano&#8208;silica sheets are obtained due to polymerization of vinyl group in VPOSS.







Abstract
Achieving self&#8208;assembled nanostructures with ultra&#8208;small feature sizes (e.&#8201;g., below 5&#8197;nm) is an important prerequisite for the development of block copolymer lithography. In this work, the preparation and self&#8208;assembly of a series of giant molecules composed of vinyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (VPOSS) tethered with monodispersed oligo(L&#8208;lactide) chains are presented. Small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results demonstrate that ultra&#8208;small domain sizes (down to 3&#8197;nm) of phase separated lamellar morphology are achieved in bulk, driven by the strong tendency and fast kinetics for crystallization of VPOSS moieties. Moreover, upon gamma ray radiation, VPOSS cages in the lamellar structure can be crosslinked via polymerization of the vinyl groups. After pyrolysis at high temperature, ultra&#8208;thin two&#8208;dimensional nano&#8208;silica sheets can be obtained.

         <title>Affinity selections of DNA&#8208;encoded chemical libraries on carbonic anhydrase IX&#8208;expressing tumor cells reveal a dependence on ligand valence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA&#8208;encoded chemical libraries are typically screened against purified protein targets. Recently, cell&#8208;based selections with encoded chemical libraries have been described, commonly revealing suboptimal performance due to insufficient recovery of binding molecules. We used carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX)&#8208;expressing tumor cells as a model system to optimize selection procedures with code&#8208;specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) as selection readout. Salt concentration and performing PCR on cell suspension had the biggest impact on selection performance, leading to 15&#8208;fold enrichment factors for high&#8208;affinity monovalent CAIX binders (acetazolamide; K  D  = 8.7 nM). Surprisingly, the homobivalent display of acetazolamide at the extremities of both complementary DNA strands led to a substantial improvement of both ligand recovery and enrichment factors (above 100&#8208;fold). The optimized procedures were used for selections with a DNA&#8208;encoded chemical library comprising 1 million members against tumor cell lines expressing CAIX, leading to a preferential recovery of known and new ligands against this validated tumor&#8208;associated target. This work may facilitate future affinity selections on cells against target proteins which might be difficult to express otherwise.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Formation, Solution Rearrangements, and Catalytic Behavior of a Polymorphic Ca/K Allyl Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical synthesis provides the metastable organocalciate K[CaA&#8217;3] (A&#8217;= 1,3&#8208;(SiMe3)2C3H3), whose &#8216;first contact&#8217; with solvent determines how fast it rearranges to a more stable form: minutes (in hexanes) to days (in arenes). The latter form of the calciate initiates the polymerization of methyl methacrylate and isoprene under mild conditions.







Abstract
Without solvents present, the often far&#8208;from&#8208;equilibrium environment in a mechanochemically driven synthesis can generate high&#8208;energy, non&#8208;stoichiometric products not observed from the same ratio of reagents used in solution. Ball milling 2&#8197;equiv. K[A&#8217;] (A&#8217;=[1,3&#8208;(SiMe3)2C3H3]&#8722;) with CaI2 yields a non&#8208;stoichiometric calciate, K[CaA&#8217;3], which initially forms a structure (1) likely containing a mixture of pi&#8208; and sigma&#8208;bound allyl ligands. Dissolved in arenes, the compound rearranges over the course of several days to a structure (2) with only &#951;3&#8208;bound allyl ligands, and that can be crystallized as a coordination polymer. If dissolved in alkanes, however, the rearrangement of 1 to 2 occurs within minutes. The structures of 1 and 2 have been modeled with DFT calculations, and 2 initiates the anionic polymerization of methyl methacrylate and isoprene; for the latter, under the mildest conditions yet reported for a heavy Group 2 species (one&#8208;atm pressure and room temperature).

         <title>Selective production of linear aldehydes and alcohols from alkenes using formic acid as syngas surrogate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Performing carbonylation without the use of carbon monoxide for high&#8208;value&#8208;added products is an attractive yet challenging topic in sustainable chemistry. Herein, effective methods for producing linear aldehydes or alcohols selectively with formic acid as both carbon monoxide and hydrogen source have been described. Linear&#8208;selective hydroformylation of alkenes proceeds smoothly with up to 88% yield and &gt; 30 regioselectivity in the presence of single Rh catalyst. Strikingly, introducing Ru into the system, the dual Rh/Ru catalysts accomplish efficient and regioselective hydroxymethylation in one pot. The present processes utilizing formic acid as syngas surrogate operate simply under mild condition, which opens a sustainable way for production of linear aldehydes and alcohols without the need for gas cylinders and autoclaves. As formic acid can be readily produced via CO 2 hydrogenation, the protocols represent indirect approaches for chemical valorization of CO 2 .</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Nitrogen Retention of Carbon Anode for Enhancing the Electrochemical Performance for Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple strategy has been successfully adopted to retain N atoms in&#8197;situ and increase production yield of a novel composite PAZ by mixing 3&#8197;wt&#8201;% of zinc borate (ZB) with poly(acrylonitrile&#8208;co&#8208;itaconic acid) (PANIA). After being carbonised at 700&#8201;&#176;C, PAZ&#8208;CF&#8208;700 maintains 90&#8201;% of the original N from PANIA. At the same time, PAZ&#8208;CF&#8208;700 also exhibits a good rate performance and excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability with a specific capacity of 94&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 4000 cycles at 1.6&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
Retaining nitrogen for polyacrylonitrile (PAN) based carbon anode is a cost&#8208;effective way to make full use of the advantages of PAN for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Here, a simple strategy has been successfully adopted to retain N atoms in&#8197;situ and increase production yield of a novel composite PAZ by mixing 3&#8197;wt&#8201;% of zinc borate (ZB) with poly (acrylonitrile&#8208;co&#8208;itaconic acid) (PANIA). Among the prepared carbonised fibre (CF) samples, PAZ&#8208;CF&#8208;700 maintains the highest N content, retaining 90&#8201;% of the original N from PANIA. It represents the highest capacity storage contribution (80.55&#8201;%) and the lowest impedance Rct (117&#8197;&#937;). Consequently, the specific capacity increases from 60&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 of PANIA&#8208;CF&#8208;700 to 190&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 of PAZ&#8208;CF&#8208;700 at a current density of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. At the same time, PAZ&#8208;CF&#8208;700 exhibits a good rate performance and excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability with a specific capacity of 94&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 4000 cycles at 1.6&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Cyano Derivatives of 7&#8208;Aminoquinoline that are Highly Emissive in Water: Potential for Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
6&#8208;Cyano&#8208;7&#8208;azidoquinoline was synthesized and found to be non&#8208;emissive in water, while the amino derivative 6CN&#8722;7AQ exhibits intense emission, making the azido/amino pair excellent in sensing H2S. Moreover, conjugation of 6CN&#8722;7AQ with peptide renders a nearly non&#8208;emissive composite that can be digested by proteinase&#8208;K, recovering intense 6CN&#8722;7AQ emission with &#8764;200&#8208;fold enhancement.







Abstract
6&#8208;Cyano&#8208;7&#8208;aminoquinoline (6CN&#8722;7AQ) and 3&#8208;cyano&#8208;7&#8208;aminoquinoline (3CN&#8722;7AQ) were synthesized and found to exhibit intense emission with quantum yield as high as 63&#8201;% and 85&#8201;%, respectively, in water. Conversely, their derivatives 6&#8208;cyano&#8208;7&#8208;azidoquinoline (6CN&#8722;7N3Q) and 3&#8208;cyano&#8208;7&#8208;azidoquinoline (3CN&#8722;7N3Q) show virtually no emission, which makes them suitable to be used as recognition agents in azide reactions based on fluorescence recovery. Moreover, conjugation of 6CN&#8722;7AQ with a hydrophobic biomembrane&#8208;penetration peptide PFVYLI renders a nearly non&#8208;emissive 6CN&#8722;7AQ&#8208;PFVYLI composite, which can be digested by proteinase K, recovering the highly emissive 6CN&#8722;7AQ with &#8764;200&#8208;fold enhancement. The result provides an effective early confirmation for RT&#8208;qPCR in viral detection.

         <title>CO2 Capture by Hydroxylated Azine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks were investigated towards their CO2 capture properties as a function of their textural and chemical features. Experimental and theoretical data indicated that the relative number of hydroxyl groups in the COF backbone acts as an adsorption threshold. For the best performing COF, a variety of CO2 concentrations and temperatures were investigated, showing excellent isothermal recyclability up to 3 cycles.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) RIO&#8208;13, RIO&#8208;12, RIO&#8208;11, and RIO&#8208;11m were investigated towards their CO2 capture properties by thermogravimetric analysis at 1&#8197;atm and 40&#8201;&#176;C. These microporous COFs bear in common the azine backbone composed of hydroxy&#8208;benzene moieties but differ in the relative number of hydroxyl groups present in each material. Thus, their sorption capacities were studied as a function of their textural and chemical properties. Their maximum CO2 uptake values showed a strong correlation with an increasing specific surface area, but that property alone could not fully explain the CO2 uptake data. Hence, the specific CO2 uptake, combined with DFT calculations, indicated that the relative number of hydroxyl groups in the COF backbone acts as an adsorption threshold, as the hydroxyl groups were indeed identified as relevant adsorption sites in all the studied COFs. Additionally, the best performing COF was thoroughly investigated, experimentally and theoretically, for its CO2 capture properties in a variety of CO2 concentrations and temperatures, and showed excellent isothermal recyclability up to 3 cycles.

Additionally, the best performing COF was thoroughly investigated, experimentally and theoretically, for its CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture properties in a variety of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations and temperatures, and showed excellent isothermal recyclability up to 3 cycles.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding Ion&#8208;Pair Cryptand Host Discrimination of Potassium Halide Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chalcogen bonding (ChB) and halogen bonding (XB) ion&#8208;pair heteroditopic cryptands exhibit cooperative recognition of potassium halide salts. Incorporation of bidentate triazole&#8208;based ChB or XB donor motifs into a dibenzo&#8208;30&#8208;crown&#8208;10&#8208;based macrobicyclic receptor framework is demonstrated to profoundly influence selectivity and affinity behaviour towards the recognition of KBr and KI ion&#8208;pairs relative to hydrogen bonding analogues.







Abstract
A series of chalcogen, halogen and hydrogen bonding heteroditopic macrobicyclic cryptands are reported and their potassium halide ion&#8208;pair recognition properties investigated. Saliently, the co&#8208;bound potassium cation was determined to be crucial in switching on the bromide and iodide recognition properties of the respective cryptand receptor. Importantly, the nature of the sigma&#8208;hole mediated interaction employed in the anion recognition component is demonstrated to significantly augment the ion&#8208;pair binding behaviour, markedly so for the halogen bonding analogue. Most notably the incorporation of a chelating chalcogen bonding donor motif significantly improves the selectivity towards KBr over KI, relative to halogen and hydrogen bonding analogues.

         <title>The Versatile Electronic, Magnetic and Photo&#8208;electro Catalytic Activity of a New 2D MA2Z4 Family</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recent successful growth of MoSi2N4 and WSi2N4 monolayer led to the discovery of a new class of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MA2Z4 materials with no known 3D layered allotropes, which renders great possibilities to integrate diverse properties by proper design of sandwiched &#8220;MZ2&#8221; building blocks and &#8220;A&#8208;Z&#8221; passivation layers. In this work, we theoretically probe the dynamic stability, electronic properties, and surface reactivity of the new MA2Z4 family, in which M is Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, A refers to Si or Ge, and Z is N, P or As. Among the proposed 54 possible combinations, about 42 compositions are dynamically stable, which vary from non&#8208;magnetic, anti&#8208;ferromagnetic, to ferromagnetic semiconductors, metals and half&#8208;metal. In particular, the VB (V, Nb, Ta) MA2Z4 possesses robust intrinsic ferromagnetism that is essential for spintronics applications. In regards to surface activity, most of MA2Z4, particularly for N or P terminated IVB and VB MA2Z4, have high catalytic potential for hydrogen evolution, and the &#8710;GH of non&#8208;magnetic MA2Z4 is highly correlated to the highest occupied p electronic states of surface Z atom. Moreover, the photocatalytic activity is also evaluated, MoSi2N4 and WSi2N4 within 4% tensile strain are capable of photocatalytic overall water splitting. Our findings indicate the new 2D MA2Z4 family has fascinating properties and possesses strong potential for applications but not limited to electronics, spintronics and catalysts, which will stimulate the interests of experimental synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>First total synthesis of phytoprostanes with prostaglandin&#8208;like&#160;configuration, evidence for their formation in edible vegetable oils and orienting study of their biological activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phytoprostanes (PhytoP) are natural products, which form in plants under oxidative stress conditions from &#945;&#8208;linolenic acid. However, their epimers with relative prostaglandin configuration termed phytoglandins (PhytoG) have never been detected in Nature, likely because of the lack of synthetic reference material. Here, the first asymmetric total synthesis of such compounds, namely of PhytoGF  1  a  &#160;(9&#8208;  epi  &#8208;16&#8208;F  1t  &#8208;PhytoP) and its diastereomer&#160;  ent  &#8208;16&#8208;  epi  &#8208; PhytoGF  1  a  &#160;(  ent  &#8208;9,16&#8208;  diepi  &#8208;16&#8208;F  1t  &#8208;PhytoP), has been accomplished. The synthetic strategy is based on radical anion oxidative cyclization, copper(I)&#8208;mediated alkyl&#8208;alkyl coupling and enantioselective reduction reactions. A UHPLC&#8208;MS/MS study using the synthesized compounds as standards indicates PhytoG formation at significant levels during autoxidation of &#945;&#8208;linolenic acid in edible vegetable oils. Initial testing of synthetic PhytoGs together with F  1  &#8208;PhytoP and 15&#8208;F  2t  &#8208;IsoP derivatives for potential interactions with the PGF  2&#945;  &#160;(FP) receptor did not reveal significant activity. The notion that PUFA&#8208;derived oxidatively formed cyclic metabolites with prostaglandin configuration do not form to a significant extent in biological or food matrices has to be corrected. Strong evidence is provided that oxidatively formed PhytoG metabolites may be ingested with plant&#8208;derived food, which necessitates further investigation of their biological profile.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulation of Src kinase activity by selective substrate recognition with pseudopeptidic cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective recognition of tyrosine (Tyr) residues in peptides is an appealing approach to inhibit their phosphorylation mediated by tyrosine kinases (TKs). Here we describe pseudopeptidic cages that efficiently protect the substrates from the action of the Src TK enzyme, precluding the corresponding Tyr phosphorylation. The most efficient cage inhibitors strongly bind the peptide substrates as shown by fluorescence emission titrations, with a very good correlation between the binding constants and the inhibitory potency. Structural insights and additional control experiments further support the proposed mechanism by the selective supramolecular protection of the substrates. Moreover, the approach also works in a completely different kinase&#8208;substrate system. These results illustrate the potential of supramolecular complexes for the efficient and selective modulation of TK signaling.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Heptacene and Its Hole&#8208;Transfer Property of Stable Thin Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heptacene (  1  ) was produced through a monoketone precursor (  2  ), which was prepared starting from 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrabromobenzene through 9 steps in a total yield of 10%. Compound  2  was converted to  1  quantitatively by heating at 202 &#176;C. Heptacene exhibited high thermal stability in the solid state without observable change over two months. To investigate the potential value of  1  as a material for  p  &#8208;type organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs), the top&#8208;contact OFET devices were fabricated by vacuum&#8208;deposition of  1  on a hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS)/SiO  2  /Si substrate. The best performance of hole mobility was 2.2 cm  2  V  &#8211;1  s  &#8211;1  . This is the first report that stable heptacene was used in an effective device and examined on its charge carrier property.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Valence Tautomerism using Redox Potentials: Studies on Ferrocene&#8208;Based Triarylmethylium Dyes With Electron&#8208;Poor Fluorenylium and Thioxanthylium Acceptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three new electrochromic ferrocenyl triarylmethylium dyes with fluorenylium (  1a  +  ,  1b  +  ) or thioxanthylium (  1c  +  ) residues were selected in order to keep the intrinsic differences of redox potentials for ferrocene oxidation and triarylmethylium reduction small and to trigger valence tautomerism. UV/Vis/NIR and quantitative EPR spectroscopy identified paramagnetic diradical isomers  1a  +&#8226;&#8226;  &#8208;1c  +&#8226;&#8226;  alongside diamagnetic forms  1a  +  &#8208;1c  +  , which renders these complexes magnetochemical switches. The diradical forms  1a  +&#8226;&#8226;  &#8208;1c  +&#8226;&#8226;  as well as the one&#8208;electron reduced triarylmethyl forms of the complexes were found to dimerize in fluid solution. For radical  1a  &#8226;  , dimerization occurs on the timescale of cyclic voltammetry, which allowed us to determine the kinetics and equilibrium constant for this process by digital simulation. M&#246;&#223;bauer spectroscopy indicated that  1a  +  and  1b  +  retain VT even in the solid state. UV/Vis/NIR spectroelectrochemistry revealed the polyelectrochromic behaviour of these complexes by establishing distinctly different electronic absorption profiles of the corresponding oxidized and reduced form  s.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Enriched Porous Carbon/SiO2 Composites Derived from Biomass Rice Husks for Boosting Li&#8208;Ion Storage: Insight into the Effect of N&#8208;Doping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;enriched porous carbon/SiO  2  (SiO  2  /NC) composite from rice husks was prepared by ball mill and tested as stable anode for lithium ion batteries (LIBs), in which the homogeneous dispersion of SiO  2  nanoparticles and carbon matrix, and high level of N&#8208;doping can be realized simultaneously. The N&#8208;doping influence on a series of SiO  2  /NC has been systematically studied, which proves that the porosity, N&#8208;doping content and electronic conductivity of SiO  2  /NC can be controlled by adjusting common nitrogen sources (urea and melamine) and doping routes including dry and wet mill to reach a desirable balance of high capacity, long&#8208;term cyclability and rate property. The optimized SiO  2  /NC composite delivers stably reversible capacity of 581 mA h g  &#8208;1  at high current load of 1.0 A g  &#8208;1  at 1000  th  . The novel Li&#8208;storage mechanism of active silica in composite has been firstly proposed upon N&#8208;doping effect that redox reaction between SiO  2  and Li  +  is accelerated to transform into alloying reaction of Si generated and Li  +  , enhancing reversible capacity. Besides, kinetics analysis confirms that there is combined Li&#8208;storage mechanism of battery&#8208;capacitive pattern in composite, which contributes to fast charge transfer and ion diffusion during cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>STED imaging the dynamic of lysosomes by dually fluorogenic Si&#8208;rhodamine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Super&#8208;resolution microscopy (SRM) imaging of the finite subcellular structures and subtle bioactivities inside organelles delivers abundant cellular information with high fidelity to unravel the intricate biological processes. An ideal fluorescent probe with precise control of fluorescence is critical in SRM technique like stimulated emission depletion (STED). Si&#8208;rhodamine was decorated with both targeting group and H  +  &#8208;receptor, affording the dually fluorogenic Si&#8208;rhodamine in which the NIR fluorescence was efficiently controlled by the coalescent of spirolactone&#8208;zwitterion equilibrium and PeT mechanism. The dually fluorogenic characters of the probe offer a perfect mutual enhancement in sensitivity, specificity and spatial resolution. Strong fluorescence only released in the existence of targeting protein at acidic lysosomal pH, ensured precisely tracking the dynamic of lysosomal structure and pH in living cells by STED.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Dinitraminic acid (HN(NO  2  )  2  , HDN) was prepared by ion exchange chromatography and acid&#8208;base reaction with basic copper(II) carbonate allowed the  in situ  preparation of copper(II) dinitramide, which was reacted with twelve nitrogen&#8208;rich ligands e.g. 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole, 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;5  H  &#8208;tetrazole, di(5  H  &#8208;tetrazolyl)&#8208;methane/&#8208;ethane/&#8208;propane/&#8208;butane. Nine of the complexes were investigated by low temperature X&#8208;ray diffraction. In addition, all compounds were investigated by infrared spectroscopy (IR), differential thermal analysis (DTA), elemental analysis (EA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) for selected compounds. Furthermore, investigations of the materials were carried out regarding their sensitivity toward impact (IS), friction (FS), ball drop impact (BDIS) and electrostatic discharge (ESD). In addition, hot plate and hot needle tests were performed. Complex [Cu(AMT)  4  (H  2  O)](DN)  2  , based on 1&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;methyltetrazole (AMT), is most outstanding for its detonative behavior and thus also capable of detonating PETN in classical initiation experiments. Laser ignition experiments at a wavelength of 915&#160;nm were performed for all substances and solid&#8208;state UV&#8208;Vis spectra were recorded for apprehending the ignition mechanism.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational designing and constructing multiphase hybrid electrode materials is an effective method to compensate for the performance defects of the single component. Based on this strategy, Cu  2  Se hexagonal nanosheets@Co  3  Se  4  nanospheres mixed structures have been fabricated by a facile two&#8208;step hydrothermal method. Under the synergistic effect of the high ionic conductivity of Cu  2  Se and the remarkable cycling stability of Co  3  Se  4  , Cu  2  Se@Co  3  Se  4  can exhibit outstanding electrochemical performance as a novel electrode material. The as&#8208;prepared Cu  2  Se@Co  3  Se  4  electrode displays high specific capacitance of 1005 F g  &#8208;1  at 1 A g  &#8208;1  with enhanced rate capability (56% capacitance retention at 10 A g  &#8208;1  ), and ultralong lifespan (94.2% after 10000 cycles at 20 A g  &#8208;1  ). An asymmetric supercapacitor is assembled applying the Cu  2  Se@Co  3  Se  4  as anode and graphene as cathode, which delivers a wide work potential window of 1.6 V, high energy density (30.9 Wh kg  &#8208;1  at 0.74 kW kg  &#8208;1  ), high power density (21.0 Wh kg  &#8208;1  at 7.50 kW kg  &#8208;1  ), and excellent cycling stability (85.8% after 10000 cycles at 10 A g  &#8208;1  ).</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A soluble and green&#8208;blue fluorescent &#960;&#8208;extended azatrioxa[8]circulene was synthesized by oxidative condensation of a 3,6&#8208;dihydroxycarbazole and 1,4&#8208;anthraquinone utilizing benzofuran scaffolding. This is the first circulene to incorporate anthracene within it carbon framework. Solvent&#8208;dependent fluorescence and bright green electroluminescence accompanied by excimer emission are key optical properties of this material. The presence of sliding &#960;&#8208;stacked columns in the single crystal of dianthracenylazatrioxa[8]circulene is found to cause a very high rate for the electron hopping making this material a promising n&#8208;type organic semiconductor with an electron mobility predicted around 2.26 cm  2  V  &#8722;1  s  &#8722;1  . The best OLED device based on the dianthracenylazatrioxa[8]circulene fluorescent emitter has a brightness around 16 000 Cd m  &#8208;2  and external quantum efficiency of 3.3%. By using dianthracenylazatrioxa[8]circulene as a host matrix material the quantum dots based OLEDs were fabricated.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantification and Prediction of Imine Formation Kinetics in Aqueous Solution by Microfluidic NMR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantitatively predicting the reactivity of dynamic covalent reaction is essential to understand and rationally design complex structures and reaction networks. In this work, we quantified the reactivity of aldehydes and amines in various rapid imine formation in aqueous solution by microfluidic NMR. Investigation of reaction kinetics allows us to quantify the forward rate constants  k  +  by an empirical equation, of which three independent parameters were introduced as reactivity parameters of aldehydes (  S  E  ,  E  ) and amines (  N  ). Furthermore, these reactivity parameters were successfully used to predict the unknown forward rate constants of imine formation. Finally, two competitive reaction networks were rationally designed based on the proposed reactivity parameters. Our work has demonstrated the capability of microfluidic NMR in quantifying the kinetics of label&#8208;free chemical reactions, especially rapid reactions that complete in minutes.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermally activated delayed fluorescence and phosphorescence quenching in iminophosphonamide copper and zinc complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of copper and zinc complexes of four variably substituted iminophosphonamide ligands is presented. While the copper complexes form ligand bridged dimers, the zinc compounds are monomeric. Due to different steric demand of the ligand the arrangement of the ligands within the dimeric complexes varies. Similar to the structurally related iminophosphonamide complexes of alkali metals and calcium, the steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence (PL) of four of the seven compounds studied here as solids in a temperature range of 5&#160;&#8211;&#160;295 K can be described within the scheme of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Accordingly, they exhibit bright blue&#8208;green phosphorescence at low temperatures (&lt;100 K), which turns into delayed fluorescence by increasing the temperature. However, unusually, the fluorescence is practically absent in two copper complexes which otherwise still conform to the TADF scheme. In these cases, the excited singlet states decay essentially non&#8208;radiatively and their thermal population from the corresponding low&#8208;lying triplet states efficiently quenches PL (phosphorescence). Three other copper and zinc complexes only exhibit prompt fluorescence, evidencing a wide variation of photophysical properties in this class of compounds. The excited states of the copper complex with especially pronounced phosphorescence quenching were also investigated by low&#8208;temperature time&#8208;resolved infrared spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Reevaluating the Solution Photophysics of Tetraphenylethylene at the Origin of their Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through actinometric NMR evaluation of the photoisomerization kinetics of tetraphenylethylene simple derivatives, it is shown that process is the almost exclusive nonradiative pathway accounting for their luminescence quenching in solution, while photocyclization plays at best a minor role.







Abstract
Although tetraphenylethylene (TPE) and its derivatives have been the most commonly used building blocks in the construction of molecules with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties, no absolute consensus exists regarding the mechanisms at the origin of the phenomenon. Restriction of intramolecular rotations (RIR) of peripheral phenyls has historically been a dominant paradigm, which has served as a valuable guideline in the molecular engineering of AIEgens. Yet, an increasing number of recent works have established that photoisomerization or photocyclization may actively participate in the nonradiative dissipation of the excitation energy. In this paper, the first experimental evaluation of the quantum efficiencies of these different processes is reported, and photoisomerization is shown to be by far the dominant photophysical pathway in solution, accounting for virtually all nonradiative decay of the molecule&#8216;s excited state in degassed solution.

         <title>Ultraviolet&#8208;Cured Semi&#8208;Interpenetrating Network Polymer Electrolytes for High&#8208;Performance Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Semi&#8208;interpenetrating network polymer (SNP) electrolyte composed of an UV&#8208;crosslinked polymer network (ETPTA), linear polymer chains (PVDF&#8208;HFP) and lithium salt solution are designed to satisfy the demands of high ionic conductivity, good mechanical flexibility and electrochemical stability. LiFePO4/Li battery based on the SNP electrolyte delivers a high specific capacity, good rate capability and cycling stability at room temperature.







Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes with relatively low ionic conductivity at room temperature and poor mechanical strength greatly restrict their practical applications. Herein, we design semi&#8208;interpenetrating network polymer (SNP) electrolyte composed of an ultraviolet&#8208;crosslinked polymer network (ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate), linear polymer chains (polyvinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) and lithium salt solution to satisfy the demand of high ionic conductivity, good mechanical flexibility, and electrochemical stability for lithium metal batteries. The semi&#8208;interpenetrating network has a pivotal effect in improving chain relaxation, facilitating the local segmental motion of polymer chains and reducing the polymer crystallinity. Thanks to these advantages, the SNP electrolyte shows a high ionic conductivity (1.12&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C), wide electrochemical stability window (4.6&#8197;V vs. Li+/Li), good bendability and shape versatility. The promoted ion transport combined with suppressed impedance growth during cycling contribute to good cell performance. The assembled quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (LiFePO4/SNP/Li) exhibit good cycling stability and rate capability at room temperature.

         <title>Synthesis of Spirocycles via Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Coupling of Thioesters and Olefins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular coupling of thioesters and olefins is reported, which provides unique and atom&#8208;economic access to spirocyclic scaffolds. This transformation is characterized by the simultaneous transfer of both acyl and thiol moieties to the alkene, with the suppression of decarbonylation and &#946;&#8208;hydrogen elimination.







Abstract
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular coupling of thioesters and olefins has been developed for the efficient synthesis of spirocycles, a privileged scaffold commonly found in natural products. This transformation is characterized by the simultaneous transfer of both acyl and thiol moieties to the alkene, with the suppression of decarbonylation and &#946;&#8208;hydrogen elimination. Initial mechanistic investigations are consistent with an oxidative addition/olefin insertion/reductive elimination mechanism. The incorporated methylene sulfide substituent can undergo a variety of further reactions to increase molecular diversity and complexity. These results demonstrate that thioester derivatives can be used as powerful building blocks for the assembly of complex scaffolds.

         <title>Cyclopentadienone Derivative Dimers as Tunable Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of novel photoswitches based on a cyclopentadienone derivative dimer was synthesized. Their photoswitching properties were investigated.







Abstract
A series of photoswitchable cyclopentadienone derivative dimers bearing bromo, thienyl, 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)phenyl, 3&#8208;pyridinyl, 4&#8208;nitrophenyl and cyano groups was designed and facilely synthesized. Photoswitching properties such as the photoconversions in the photostationary state (PSS), the thermal kinetics and thermal half&#8208;lives of photoisomers were systematically investigated. These photoswitches show high fatigue resistance and large photoconversions in the PSS. This work proves that the photoswitching properties of photoswitches based on cyclopentadienone dimers can be tuned by substitution groups and also pave the way to functionalize the cyclopentadienone derivative dimer&#8208;based photoswitch, which is important for its future applications.

Compared to common types of Au(I) coordination, such as linear, trigonal planar, and tetrahedral units observed in extended solids, the square planar coordination is rare. Au(I)relia, shown in the cover image, exhibits the 3&#8208;centered bonding of Au&#8208;Tt&#8208;Au and Au&#8208;Pn&#8208;Au (on her feathers), square planar cis&#8208;[AuTt2Pn2] units (her pendant), and linear &#8230;&#8208;Au&#8208;Au&#8208;Au&#8208;&#8230; chains (her legs) that are characteristic of the novel equiatomic AuSiAs, AuGeP, and AuGeAs compounds.

         <title>Interconnectivity between Surface Reactivity and Self&#8208;Assembly of Kemp Elimination Catalyzing Nanorods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;powered assembly: Synthetic functional assembly of catalytic unit (gold nanorod), principally regulated through their surface catalytic reactivity towards proton transfer reaction is reported. The hydrophobic cavities formed during flocking of gold nanorods has been utilized as reactors for hydrophobic substrates towards aromatic nucleophilic substitution reaction in aqueous media, demonstrating a catalytic cascading which is completely unrelated to primary reaction products.







Abstract
Understanding the fundamental facts behind dynamicity of catalytic processes has been a longstanding quest across disciplines. Herein, we report self&#8208;assembly of catalytically active gold nanorods that can be regulated by tuning its reactivity towards a proton transfer reaction at different pH. Unlike substrate&#8208;induced templating and co&#8208;operativity, the enhanced aggregation rate is due to alteration of catalytic surface charge only during reactivity as negatively charged transition state of reactant (5&#8208;nitrobenzisoxazole) is formed on positively charged nanorod while undergoing a concerted E2&#8208;pathway. Herein, enhanced diffusivity during catalytic processes might also act as an additional contributing factor. Furthermore, we have also shown that nanosized hydrophobic cavities of clustered nanorods can also efficiently accelerate the rate of an aromatic nucleophilic substitution reaction, which also demonstrates a catalytic phenomenon that can lead to cascading of other reactions where substrates and products of the starting reactions are not directly involved.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Self&#8208;powered assembly&lt;/b&gt;: Synthetic functional assembly of catalytic unit (gold nanorod), principally regulated through their surface catalytic reactivity towards proton transfer reaction is reported. The hydrophobic cavities formed during flocking of gold nanorods has been utilized as reactors for hydrophobic substrates towards aromatic nucleophilic substitution reaction in aqueous media, demonstrating a catalytic cascading which is completely unrelated to primary reaction products.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the fundamental facts behind dynamicity of catalytic processes has been a longstanding quest across disciplines. Herein, we report self&#8208;assembly of catalytically active gold nanorods that can be regulated by tuning its reactivity towards a proton transfer reaction at different pH. Unlike substrate&#8208;induced templating and co&#8208;operativity, the enhanced aggregation rate is due to alteration of catalytic surface charge only during reactivity as negatively charged transition state of reactant (5&#8208;nitrobenzisoxazole) is formed on positively charged nanorod while undergoing a concerted E2&#8208;pathway. Herein, enhanced diffusivity during catalytic processes might also act as an additional contributing factor. Furthermore, we have also shown that nanosized hydrophobic cavities of clustered nanorods can also efficiently accelerate the rate of an aromatic nucleophilic substitution reaction, which also demonstrates a catalytic phenomenon that can lead to cascading of other reactions where substrates and products of the starting reactions are not directly involved.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Rapid and Mild Lactamization Using Highly Electrophilic Triphosgene in a Microflow Reactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid (0.5 to 10&#8197;s), mild, inexpensive, and less wasteful lactamization was achieved using highly electrophilic triphosgene in a micro&#8208;flow reactor. This work reports two methods using NMM and NMI, respectively. The slight difference in basicity is critical in the lactamization depending on the type of lactam. A plausible reaction mechanism was discussed. Various lactams as well as a cyclic peptide containing acid&#8208; and/or heat&#8208;labile functional groups were synthesized in good to high yields without tedious purifications. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Fuse et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100059).
