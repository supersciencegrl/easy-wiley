         <title>Cd/Cd(OH)2 Nanosheets Enhancing the Electrocatalytic Activity of CO2 Reduction to CO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electric&#8208;driven conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) to carbon monoxide (CO) under mild reaction conditions offers a promising approach to mitigate the greenhouse effect and the energy crisis. The surface engineering is believed to be one of the prospective methods for enhancing the electrocatalytic activity&#160;of CO2 reduction. Herein, the hydroxyl (OH) groups were successfully introduced to cadmium nanosheets to form cadmium and cadmium hydroxide nanocomposites (i.e. Cd/Cd(OH)2 nanosheets) via a facile two&#8208;step method. The as&#8208;prepared Cd/Cd(OH)2/CP (CP indicates carbon paper) electrode displays excellent electrocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction to produce CO. The Faradaic efficiency of CO reaches 98.3% and the current density achieves 23.8 mA cm&#8208;2 at &#8208;2.0 V vs. Ag/Ag+ in a CO2&#8208;saturated 30 wt% 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazole hexafluorophosphate ([Bmim]PF6)&#8208;65 wt% acetonitrile (CH3CN)&#8208;5 wt% water (H2O) electrolyte. And the CO partial current density can reach up to 71.6 mA cm&#8208;2 with the CO Faradaic efficiency of more than 85% at &#8208;2.3 V vs. Ag/Ag+, which stands out against Cd/CP, Cd(OH)2/CP, and Cd/CdO/CP electrodes. The excellent electrocatalytic performance of the Cd/Cd(OH)2/CP electrode can be attributed to its unique structural properties, suitable OH groups, perfect interaction with electrolyte, abundant active sites and fast electron transfer rate.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing Radical Addition to 1&#8208;Phosphabutadienes by Employing Muonium as a &#8220;Light Isotope&#8221; of Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding free radical addition to multiple bonds is important to elucidating the mechanistic details of addition polymerization reactions, albeit the fleeting radical intermediates are very difficult to detect by conventional methodologies. Muon spin spectroscopy (&#181;SR) is a highly sensitive method that can detect radical species at 106 spins (cf. EPR: 1012 spins, NMR: 1018 spins). Herein, we employ &#181;SR to detect the radical&#8208;addition products from three 1&#8208;phosphabutadiene monomers, P&#8208;analogues of isoprene. We show that muonium (Mu), a &#8220;light&#8221; H&#8208;atom surrogate, adds predominantly at the C4 position of the P1=C2&#8211;C3=C4 moiety to give unprecedented 1&#8208;phosphaallyl radicals as the major products. Our structural assignments are supported by assignment of muon, phosphorus and proton hyperfine coupling constants using DFT&#8208;calculations. A minor radical product is also detected that is tentatively assigned to an PC3&#8208;heterocyclic free radical. On the basis of DFT&#8208;predictions, we speculate that its formation may involve initial addition of Mu+ at the C3 position followed by electron capture. These studies provide rare insights into the prospective radical (or cationic) polymerization of 1&#8208;phosphabutadienes, which have previously been polymerized using anionic initiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering a Cl&#8208;&#8208;Modulated Light&#8208;Driven Na+ Pump</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microbial Na+&#8208;pumping rhodopsin (NaR) is a promising optogenetic tool due to its unique ability to transport Na+. Like most rhodopsin&#8208;based tools, NaR is limited to light&#8208;based control. In this study, our objective was to develop a novel mode of modulation for NaR beyond light control. By introducing a potential Cl&#8208; binding site near the putative Na+ release cavity, we engineered Nonlabens dokdonensis rhodopsin 2 (NdR2) to be modulated by Cl&#8208;, an essential chemical in organisms. The engineered NdR2 demonstrated an approximately two&#8208;fold increase in Na+ pump activity in the presence of 100 mM Cl&#8208; compared to Cl&#8208;&#8208;free solution. Increasing Cl&#8208; concentration decreased the lifetimes of the M and O intermediates accordingly. The analysis of competitive ion uptake suggested the bound Cl&#8208; may increase the Na+ affinity and selectivity. This chemical modulation allows for more diverse and precise control over cellular processes, advancing the development of next&#8208;generation optogenetic tools. Notably, our Cl&#8208;&#8208;modulated NdR2 establishes an innovative mechanism for linking Cl&#8208; to Na+&#8208;related processes, with potential applications in optogenetic therapies for related diseases.</dc:description>

The engineered NdR2 demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in Na+ pump activity in the presence of 100 mM Cl- compared to Cl--free solution. Increasing Cl- concentration decreased the lifetimes of the M and O intermediates accordingly. The analysis of competitive ion uptake suggested the bound Cl- may increase the Na+ affinity and selectivity.

         <title>Niobium&#8208;Based Oxide for Anode Materials for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, it has become imperative to develop high energy density as well as high safety lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBS) to meet the growing energy demand. Among the anode materials used in LIBs, the currently used commercial graphite has low capacity and is a safety hazard due to the formation of lithium dendrites during the reaction. Among the transition metal oxide (TMO) anode materials, TMO based on the intercalation reaction mechanism has a more stable structure and is less prone to volume expansion than TMO based on the conversion reaction mechanism, especially the niobium&#8208;based oxide in it has attracted much attention. Niobium&#8208;based oxides have a high operating potential to inhibit the formation of lithium dendrites and lithium deposits to ensure safety, and have stable and fast lithium ion transport channels with excellent multiplicative performance. This review summarizes the recent developments of niobium&#8208;based oxides as anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries, discusses the special structure and electrochemical reaction mechanism of the materials, the synthesis methods and morphology of nanostructures, deficiencies and improvement strategies, and looks into the future developments and challenges of niobium&#8208;based oxide anode materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Dioxygen Activation and Reduction by a Soluble Iron Phthalocyanine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iron ions in a square&#8208;planar coordination can bind molecules at the vacant axial positions and are able to transform them in stoichiometric and catalytic reactions. Nature takes advantage of these properties by incorporating iron into porphyrin systems, which play a key role not only in the binding and transport of oxygen, but also in catalytic oxidation and reduction reactions involving cytochrome P450. Although these systems have been studied extensively, there are still unresolved questions regarding the interplay between the iron ions and the surrounding ligands. Phthalocyanines (Pc) create a similar environment for metal atoms and FePc is known for a long time. However, without axial ligands FePc aggregates leading to solids of low solubility. In this work we used a known six&#8208;coordinate iron phthalocyanine derivative with bulky substituents and removed the stabilizing axial ligands. The resulting paramagnetic, four&#8208;coordinate compound does not aggregate and dissolves well so that NMR spectroscopy can be employed for studying the molecular structure and the reactivity. Solvent molecules bind weakly to the iron centers and oxygen is reduced in the presence of H&#8208;atom donors. The stoichiometric and catalytic reactivity with oxygen was studied in more detail.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Multifunctional Ni(OH)2&#8208;supported Core&#8208;shell Ni@Pd Nanocomposites for the Electro&#8208;oxidation of Small Organic Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the domain of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), the development of efficient and durable catalysts for the electro&#8208;oxidation of  small  organic molecules, especially of alcohols (methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol, et al.) has always been a hot topic. A large number of related electrocatalysts with splendid performance have been designed and synthesized till now, while the preparation processes of most of them are demanding on experimental operations and conditions. Herein, we put forward a facile and handy method for the preparation of multifunctional Ni(OH)2&#8208;supported core&#8208;shell Ni@Pd nanocomposites (Ni(OH)2/Ni@Pd NCs) with the assistance of galvanic replacement reaction (GRR) at room temperature and ambient pressure. As expected, the Ni(OH)2 substrate can prevent the aggregation of core&#8208;shell (CS) Ni@Pd nanoparticles (NPs) and inhibit the formation of COads and further prevent Pd from being poisoned. The synergistic effect between CS Ni@Pd NPs and Ni(OH)2 substrate and the electronic effect between Pd shell and Ni core contribute to the outstanding electrocatalytic performance for methanol, ethanol, and ethylene glycol oxidation in alkaline condition.

A large number of related electrocatalysts with splendid performance have been designed and synthesized till now, while the preparation processes of most of them are demanding on experimental operations and conditions. Herein, we put forward a facile and handy method for the preparation of multifunctional Ni(OH)2-supported core-shell Ni@Pd nanocomposites (Ni(OH)2/Ni@Pd NCs) with the assistance of galvanic replacement reaction (GRR) at room temperature and ambient pressure. As expected, the Ni(OH)2 substrate can prevent the aggregation of core-shell (CS) Ni@Pd nanoparticles (NPs) and inhibit the formation of COads and further prevent Pd from being poisoned. The synergistic effect between CS Ni@Pd NPs and Ni(OH)2 substrate and the electronic effect between Pd shell and Ni core contribute to the outstanding electrocatalytic performance for methanol, ethanol, and ethylene glycol oxidation in alkaline condition. This study provides a succinct method for the design and preparation of efficient Pd-based electrocatalysts for alcohol electro-oxidation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Exfoliation of Graphene Oxide: Unveiling Structural Properties and Electrochemical Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Between the sheets: The Intercalation&#8208;Exfoliation (I&#8208;E) method was successfully applied to produce graphene oxide (GO) materials with adjustable oxidation levels, defect density, and crystallite size by tuning applied potential and electrolyte concentration. Investigating the electrochemical properties of these GO samples via CV and EIS measurements with a selected redox probe establishes meaningful correlations between their structural features and performance.







Abstract
An electrochemical exfoliation method for the production of graphene oxide and its characterization by electrochemical techniques are presented here. Graphite rods are used as working electrode in a three&#8208;electrode electrochemical cell, and electro&#8208;exfoliation is achieved by applying anodic polarization in a sulfuric acid solution. The electrochemical process involved two steps characterized by an intercalation at lower potential and an exfoliation at higher potential. The electrochemical behavior of the produced GO is studied through cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). X ray Photoelectronic Spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) are employed to characterize the structural and chemical properties of the exfoliated GO. The results demonstrate that the electrochemical exfoliation method yields GO materials with varying degrees of oxidation, defect density, and crystallite size, depending on the applied potential and acid concentration. The graphene oxide samples exhibited distinct electrochemical properties, including charge transfer resistance, interfacial capacitance, and relaxation times for the charge transfer, as revealed by CV and EIS measurements with a specifically selected redox probe. The comprehensive characterization performed provides valuable insights into the structure&#8208;property relationships of the GO materials synthesized through electrochemical exfoliation of graphite.

         <title>Molecular Syringe for Cargo Photorelease: Red&#8208;Light&#8208;Triggered Supramolecular Hydrogel</title>

Red&#8208;y, steady, drop: Molecular syringe is a peptide&#8208;derived photochromic hydrogel that can be loaded with cargo and then release the guest when biocompatible red light illuminates it under physiological conditions.







Abstract
Photochromic supramolecular hydrogels are versatile materials that show macroscopic effects upon irradiation, like liquefaction or shape changes. Here, we demonstrate a simple photochromic cyclic dipeptide (2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine&#8208;based) supergelator, composed of (S)&#8208;lysine and an azobenzene analogue of phenylalanine, that forms supramolecular hydrogels even at 0.1&#8197;wt% loading. The gels can physically encapsulate cargo molecules and release them to the environment in a controllable manner upon irradiation with red light, thus working as a &#8220;molecular syringe&#8221;. As the material is biocompatible and operational in the &#8220;therapeutic window&#8221; of light (&gt;650&#8197;nm) that deeply penetrates soft human tissues, it is applicable to smart drug&#8208;delivery systems.

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Ring&#8208;Closing Alkyne&#8208;Carbonyl Metathesis for the Synthesis of Butenolides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;closing alkyne&#8208;carbonyl metathesis has been developed to construct &#947;&#8208;butenolides and related naturally occurring compounds, featuring the concurrent formation of a carbon&#8208;carbon double bond and a ketone group in 100&#8201;% atom economy.







Abstract
Alkyne&#8208;carbonyl metathesis is a type of carbon&#8208;carbon forming reaction involving the construction a carbon&#8208;carbon double bond and a carbonyl group in one transformation. Herein, a Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;closing alkyne&#8208;carbonyl metathesis protocol has been developed to make densely substituted &#947;&#8208;butenolides from propargyl &#945;&#8208;ketoesters. It features 100&#8201;% atom economy, excellent substrate flexibility and benign functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that the coordinative interaction between the gold catalyst and the alkyne might initiate the transfer of an oxygen atom and the formation of the carbon&#8208;carbon double bond. By using this gold&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;closing alkyne&#8208;carbonyl metathesis as a key step reaction, four naturally occurring butenolide&#8208;type compounds including decumbic acid (45&#8201;% yield for 3&#8197;steps), deoxyisosporothric acid (32&#8201;% yield for 5&#8197;steps), lichesterinic acid (34&#8201;% yield for 5&#8197;steps) and isomuronic acid (6&#8201;% yield for 8&#8197;steps) have been synthesized starting from commercially available starting materials.

         <dc:description>
The formal diastereodivergent asymmetric synthesis of 2,5&#8208;cis/trans pyrrolidines was achieved by using a different type of activated alkenes. The silver complex&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of imino lactones with ylidene&#8208;isoxazolones, and subsequent transformation afforded chiral pyrrolidines with 2,5&#8208;trans diastereoselectivity. In contrast, 2,5&#8208;cis substituted pyrrolidines were obtained by the reaction of imino lactones with acyclic enones.







Abstract
The stereodivergent asymmetric synthesis of 2,5&#8208;trans/cis pyrrolidines by 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition using two different types of activated alkenes is described. When ylidene&#8208;isoxazolones were employed as dipolarophiles, the Ag/(S,Sp)&#8208;iPr&#8208;FcPHOX&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [3+2] cycloaddition of imino lactones proceeded with 2,5&#8208;trans selectivity. Subsequent decarboxylation of the isoxazolone rings produced pyrrolidines with 2,5&#8208;trans stereoretention. In the reaction using acyclic enones as activated alkenes, the Ag/(R,Sp)&#8208;ThioClickFerrophos complex&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [3+2] cycloaddition afforded 2,5&#8208;cis substituted pyrrolidines in high yields and enantioselectivities. Therefore, these methods can be considered as a formal stereodivergent synthesis of 2,5&#8208;cis/trans pyrrolidines.

         <title>Non&#8208;Hydrolysable Analogues of Cyclic and Branched Condensed Phosphates: Chemistry and Chemical Proteomics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemical proteomics approach for non&#8208;linear polyphosphates: Pull&#8208;down probes of non&#8208;hydrolysable analogues of cyclic and branched condensed phosphates, called meta&#8208; and ultraphosphonates, were developed to explore the elusive interactome of meta&#8208; and ultraphosphates. Application to yeast cell extracts provided datasets of potential interactors. In addition, condensation reactions of meta&#8208; and ultraphosphonates were studied in this work.







Abstract
Studies into the biology of condensed phosphates almost exclusively cover linear polyphosphates. However, there is evidence for the presence of cyclic polyphosphates (metaphosphates) in organisms and for enzymatic digestion of branched phosphates (ultraphosphates) with alkaline phosphatase. Further research of non&#8208;linear condensed phosphates in biology would profit from interactome data of such molecules, however, their stability in biological media is limited. Here we present syntheses of modified, non&#8208;hydrolysable analogues of cyclic and branched condensed phosphates, called meta&#8208; and ultraphosphonates, and their application in a chemical proteomics approach using yeast cell extracts.

     alt="Non-Hydrolysable Analogues of Cyclic and Branched Condensed Phosphates: Chemistry and Chemical Proteomics"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A chemical proteomics approach for non-linear polyphosphates&lt;/b&gt;: Pull-down probes of non-hydrolysable analogues of cyclic and branched condensed phosphates, called meta- and ultraphosphonates, were developed to explore the elusive interactome of meta- and ultraphosphates. Application to yeast cell extracts provided datasets of potential interactors. In addition, condensation reactions of meta- and ultraphosphonates were studied in this work.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies into the biology of condensed phosphates almost exclusively cover linear polyphosphates. However, there is evidence for the presence of cyclic polyphosphates (metaphosphates) in organisms and for enzymatic digestion of branched phosphates (ultraphosphates) with alkaline phosphatase. Further research of non-linear condensed phosphates in biology would profit from interactome data of such molecules, however, their stability in biological media is limited. Here we present syntheses of modified, non-hydrolysable analogues of cyclic and branched condensed phosphates, called meta- and ultraphosphonates, and their application in a chemical proteomics approach using yeast cell extracts. We identify putative interactors with overlapping hits for structurally related capture compounds underlining the quality of our results. The datasets serve as starting point to study the biological relevance and functions of meta- and ultraphosphates. In addition, we examine the reactivity of meta- and ultraphosphonates with implications for their &#8220;hydrolysable&#8221; analogues: Efforts to increase the ring-sizes of meta- or cyclic ultraphosphonates revealed a strong preference to form trimetaphosphate-analogue structures by cyclization and/or ring-contraction. Using carbodiimides for condensation, the so far inaccessible dianhydro product of ultraphosphonate, corresponding to P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, was selectively obtained and then ring-opened by different nucleophiles yielding modified cyclic ultraphosphonates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution using a Nickel&#8208;based Calixpyrrole Complex: Controlling the Secondary Coordination Sphere on an Electrode Surface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel calixpyrrole complex with pendant amine groups is reported, which forms a heterogeneous hydrogen evolution catalyst using anilinium tetrafluoroborate as the proton source. Turnover frequencies (TOF) up to 25,900&#8197;s&#8722;1 or 366,000&#8197;s&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 were observed and a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) process involving the pendant amine groups was found to be rate&#8208;limiting.Twitter usernames: SuesGroup







Abstract
Incorporating design elements from homogeneous catalysts to construct well defined active sites on electrode surfaces is a promising approach for developing next generation electrocatalysts for energy conversion reactions. Furthermore, if functionalities that control the electrode microenvironment could be integrated into these active sites it would be particularly appealing. In this context, a square planar nickel calixpyrrole complex, Ni(DPMDA) (DPMDA=2,2&#8242;&#8208;((diphenylmethylene)bis(1H&#8208;pyrrole&#8208;5,2&#8208;diyl))bis(methaneylylidene))bis(azaneylylidene))dianiline) with pendant amine groups is reported that forms a heterogeneous hydrogen evolution catalyst using anilinium tetrafluoroborate as the proton source. The supported Ni(DPMDA) catalyst was surprisingly stable and displayed fast reaction kinetics with turnover frequencies (TOF) up to 25,900&#8197;s&#8722;1 or 366,000&#8197;s&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Kinetic isotope effect (KIE) studies revealed a KIE of 5.7, and this data, combined with Tafel slope analysis, suggested that a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) process involving the pendant amine groups was rate&#8208;limiting. While evidence of an outer&#8208;sphere reduction of the Ni(DPMDA) catalyst was observed, it is hypothesized that the control over the secondary coordination sphere provided by the pendant amines facilitated such high TOFs and enabled the PCET mechanism. The results reported herein provide insight into heterogeneous catalyst design and approaches for controlling the secondary coordination sphere on electrode surfaces.

         <title>Access to Chiral O,O&#8208;Acetals Enabled by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Addition of Oximes to Alkoxyallenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselective coupling of oximes and alkoxy allenes enables the access to enantiomerically pure O,O&#8208;acetals, in which the hydrogen bonding interaction between the amide group of the diphosphine ligand and the alkoxy allene is decisive for the high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Enantiomerically pure acyclic O,O&#8208;acetal compounds (up to 97&#8201;%&#8197;ee) have been accessed through chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselective palladium&#8208;catalyzed addition of oximes to alkoxyallenes. DFT calculations support that a protonative hydropalladation pathway is favourable, in which the hydrogen bonding interaction between the amide group of the diphosphine ligand and the alkoxyallene is critical for the highly stereoselective formation of the dioxygenated stereogenic center.

         <title>Reversible Binding of Hydrogen and Styrene Coordination on a Manganese Phosphenium Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co&#8208;photolysis of two simple N&#8208;heterocyclic phosphenium complexes with H2 proceeds in one case under cooperative addition of H2 across the P=Mn double bond and in the other case via decarbonylation without participation of H2. The origin of this divergence and preliminary results on the passing on of the H2 molecule to styrene are discussed.







Abstract
The reactions of two complexes [(RNHP)Mn(CO)4] (RNHP=N&#8208;arylated N&#8208;heterocyclic phosphenium) with H2 at elevated pressure (&#8776;4&#8197;bar) were studied by NMR spectroscopy. Irradiation with UV light initialized in one case (5&#8201;a, R=Dipp) the unselective formation of (RNHP&#8208;H)MnH(CO)4] (6&#8201;a) via cooperative addition of H2 across the Mn=P double bond. In the other case (5&#8201;b, R=Mes), addition of H2 was unobservable and the reaction proceeded via decarbonylation to a dimeric species [(RNHP)2Mn2(CO)7] (7&#8201;b) that was isolated and identified spectroscopically. Taking into account the outcome of further reaction studies under various conditions in the absence and presence of H2, both transformations can be explained in the context of a common mechanism involving decarbonylation to 7&#8201;a,b as the first step, and the different outcome is attributable to the fact that 7&#8201;b is unreactive towards both H2 and CO while 7&#8201;a is not. DFT studies relate this divergence to deviations in the molecular constitution and stability arising from a different level of steric congestion.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Co-photolysis&lt;/b&gt; of two simple N-heterocyclic phosphenium complexes with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; proceeds in one case under cooperative addition of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; across the P=Mn double bond and in the other case via decarbonylation without participation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The origin of this divergence and preliminary results on the passing on of the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule to styrene are discussed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reactions of two complexes [(&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;NHP)Mn(CO)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;NHP=N-arylated N-heterocyclic phosphenium) with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at elevated pressure (&#8776;4&#8197;bar) were studied by NMR spectroscopy. Irradiation with UV light initialized in one case (&lt;b&gt;5&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;, R=Dipp) the unselective formation of (&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;NHP-H)MnH(CO)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;6&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;) via cooperative addition of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; across the Mn=P double bond. In the other case (&lt;b&gt;5&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;, R=Mes), addition of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was unobservable and the reaction proceeded via decarbonylation to a dimeric species [(&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;NHP)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;7&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;) that was isolated and identified spectroscopically. Taking into account the outcome of further reaction studies under various conditions in the absence and presence of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, both transformations can be explained in the context of a common mechanism involving decarbonylation to &lt;b&gt;7&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;,&lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt; as the first step, and the different outcome is attributable to the fact that &lt;b&gt;7&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt; is unreactive towards both H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO while &lt;b&gt;7&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; is not. DFT studies relate this divergence to deviations in the molecular constitution and stability arising from a different level of steric congestion. Preliminary studies suggest further that &lt;b&gt;5&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as well as &lt;b&gt;6&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; enable the photo-induced hydrogenation of styrene to ethyl benzene, even if the mechanism and possibly catalytic nature of this process remain yet unknown.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reduced Graphene Oxide Modulated FeSe/C Anode Materials for High&#8208;Stable and Long&#8208;Life Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rGO layer on electrode exhibits robust adsorption energies towards EC, DEC, and K+&#8208;ions, regulating the EDL around electrode. The special behavior changes the SEI and markedly improves the reaction kinetics. Meanwhile, rGO with robust mechanical properties remains the integrity of SEI and FeSe/C@rGO electrode. Under these synergies, the anode exhibits excellent potassium storage properties.







Abstract
Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) has been demonstrated to effectively enhance the potassium storage performance of transition metal selenides due to its robust mechanical properties and high conductivity. However, the impact of rGO on the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface, a crucial factor in the electrochemical performance of potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs), requires further exploration. In this study, we synthesized a seamless architecture of rGO on FeSe/C nanocrystals (FeSe/C@rGO). Comparative analysis between FeSe/C and FeSe/C@rGO reveals that the rGO layer exhibits robust adsorption energies towards EC and DEC, inducing the formation of organic&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) without damage to the structural integrity. Furthermore, incorporating rGO triggers K+&#8208;ions into the double electrode layer (EDL), markedly improving the transport of K+&#8208;ions. As a PIB anode, FeSe/C@rGO exhibits a reversible capacity of 332&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 300 cycles, along with excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability, showcasing an ultralow decay rate of only 0.086&#8201;% per cycle after 1900 cycles at 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Phenothiazinone as Fluorophore and Its Application in Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical synthesis of phenothiazinone via oxidative cyclocondensation of quinone and 2&#8208;aminothiophenol under mild condition is presented, along with its bio&#8208;application as fluorophore for lipid droplets imaging in living cells.







Abstract
Phenothiazinone is a promising yet underutilized fluorophore, possibly due to the lack of a general accessibility. This study reports a robust and scalable TEMPO&#8208;mediated electrochemical method to access a variety of phenothiazinones from 2&#8208;aminothiophenols and quinones. The electrosynthesis proceeds in a simple cell architecture under mild condition, and notably carbon&#8211;halogen bond in quinones remains compared to conventional methods, enabling orthogonal downstream functionalization. Mechanistic studies corroborate that TEMPO exerts a protective effect in avoiding product decomposition at the cathode. In particular, benzophenothiazinones show intriguing luminescence in both solid and solution state, and thus their photophysical properties are scrutinized in detail. Further bio&#8208;imaging of the lipid droplets in living cells highlights the considerable promise of benzophenothiazinones as fluorescent dye in the biomedical fields.

         <title>Dispersing LiCl in Zwitterionic COF for Highly Efficient Ammonia Storage and Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zwitterionic covalent organic frameworks (COF) is proposed as a porous hosts to disperse LiCl for highly efficient NH3 storage and separation. The anionic and cationic groups in zwitterionic COF act as two separated positive and negative charged sites to facilitate the dispersion of lithium chloride, which makes LiCl doped zwitterionic COF exhibit excellent NH3 capture performance.







Abstract
Efficient and inherently safe NH3 storage and separation are of significant importance for the chemical industry. Herein, we proposed zwitterionic COF as a porous host to disperse LiCl for highly efficient NH3 storage and separation with record adsorption capacity. The equivalently cationic and anionic groups in the channels of zwitterionic COF could act as two separated sites to facilitate the dispersion of LiCl, hence the optimal composite exhibits a high capture capacity of 44.98&#8197;mmol/g at 25&#8201;&#176;C and 1&#8197;bar, far exceeding other existing porous materials. Notably, the adsorption capacity is completely reversible and the efficient separation of NH3 from NH3/CO2/N2 mixture is achieved through breakthrough experiments. DFT calculation combined with XPS and 7Li&#8197;NMR experimental results give insight into the interaction between zwitterionic COF and LiCl. This work extends possibilities for the development of efficient adsorbents for NH3 storage and separation.

         <title>High Mannose Oligosaccharide Hemimimetics that Recapitulate the Conformation and Binding Mode to Concanavalin A, DC&#8208;SIGN and Langerin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The "carbohydrate chemical mimicry" exhibited by sp2&#8208;iminosugars has been utilized to develop practical syntheses for analogs of the branched high&#8208;mannose&#8208;type oligosaccharides (HMOs) Man3 and Man5. In these compounds, the terminal nonreducing Man residues have been substituted with 5,6&#8208;oxomethylydenemannonojirimycin (OMJ) motifs. The resulting oligomannoside hemimimetic accurately reproduce the structure, configuration, and conformational behavior of the original mannoligosaccharides, as confirmed by NMR and computational techniques. Binding studies with mannose binding lectins, including concanavalin A, DC&#8208;SIGN, and langerin, by enzyme&#8208;linked lectin assay and surface plasmon resonance revealed significant variations in their ability to accommodate the OMJ unit in the mannose binding site. Intriguingly, OMJMan segments demonstrated "in line" heteromultivalent effects during binding to the three lectins. Similar to the mannobiose (Man2) branches in HMOs, the binding modes involving the external or internal monosaccharide unit at the carbohydrate binding domain exist in equilibrium, facilitating sliding and recapture processes. This equilibrium, which influences the multivalent binding of HMOs, can be finely modulated upon incorporation of the OMJ sp2&#8208;iminosugar caps. As a proof of concept, the affinity and selectivity towards DC&#8208;SIGN and langerin were adjustable by presenting the OMJMan epitope in platforms with diverse architectures and valencies.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Functional Isosorbide&#8208;Based Polyesters and Polyamides by Passerini Three&#8208;Component Polymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new family of functional isosorbide&#8208;based polyesters and polyamides with high glass transition temperature are prepared via Passerini&#8208;three component polymerization (P&#8208;3CP). To optimize the P&#8208;3CP conditions, the influence of the polymerization solvent, temperature, feed ratio on the molar mass of final polymers are investigated. The higher molar mass (up to 10100 g/mol) and yield (&gt;70%) are achieved under mild conditions (30 &#176;C, standard atmosphere). Functional side groups, such as alkenyl, alkynyl and methyl ester, were introduced into polymer structure via P&#8208;3CP by using functional isocyanides. The obtained polyesters and polyamides are characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and infrared (IR) spectroscopies, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). All polymers are thermal stable and amorphous with variable glass transition temperatures (Tg). The obtained polyester has Tg up to 87.5 &#176;C, while the Tg of polyamides (ISPA&#8208;2) is detected to be 97.5 &#176;C depending on the amide bonds in the polymer backbone and the benzene ring side groups. The cytotoxicity is investigated by the CCK&#8208;8 assay against mBMSC cells to confirm the biological safety. Overall, this novel strategy provides an efficient approach to produce functional isosorbide&#8208;based polyesters and polyamides, which are promising prospect for being applied to biodegradable materials.</dc:description>

         <title>New protocol for the synthesis of S&#8208;thioesters from benzylic, allylic and tertiary alcohols with thioacetic acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new one&#8208;pot solvent&#8208;less reaction to convert benzylic, allylic, ferrocenyl or tertiary alcohols into S&#8208;thioesters, bench&#8208;stable and less odorous precursors of the corresponding thiols, which is based on reactions in neat thioacetic acid in the presence of tetrafluoroboric acid, is presented. Reaction monitoring by NMR and GC of the benzyl alcohol conversion indicated the intermediate formation of benzyl acetate and benzyl thionoacetate (PhCH2OC(S)CH3) prior to the slower conversion to the final S&#8208;benzyl thioacetate product. Increasing the HBF4 concentration enhanced the reaction rate, giving good to excellent yield (up to 99%) for a large scope of alcohols. Control experiments, with support of DFT calculations, have revealed a thermodynamically favorable, though requiring HBF4&#8208;activation, disproportionation of CH3C(O)SH to CH3C(O)OH and CH3C(S)SH, the latter immediately decomposing to H2S and (MeC)4S6 but also generating the hitherto unreported [MeC(O)C(Me)S]2(&#181;&#8208;S)2. Kinetic investigations demonstrated that the rate of benzyl alcohol conversion is second&#8208;order in [PhCH2OH] and second order in [HBF4], while the rate of conversion of the benzyl acetate intermediate to S&#8208;benzyl thioacetate is second order in [PhCOOMe] and fourth order in [HBF4]. The DFT calculations rationalize the need to two alcohol molecules and two protons to generate the reactive benzyl cation.</dc:description>

         <title>Cold Plasma for Green Advanced Reduction/Oxidation Processes (AROPs) of Organic Pollutants in Water
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plasma activation: These extremely reactive milieux attack any organic compound, including the most refractory environmental pollutants, leading to their mineralization. Depending on the specific target, suitable plasma sources can be developed for best performance. Cold plasmas offer the promise of novel technologies for PFAS degradation in water under ambient conditions using only (green) energy.







Abstract
Cold plasma is gaining increasing attention as a novel tool to activate energy demanding chemical processes, including advanced reduction/oxidation processes (AROPs) of organic pollutants in water. The very complex milieu generated by discharges at the water/plasma interface comprises photons, strong oxidants and strong reductants which can be exploited for achieving the degradation of most any kind of pollutants. Despite the complexity of these systems, the powerful arsenal of mechanistic tools and chemical probes of physical organic chemists can be usefully applied to understand and develop plasma chemistry. Specifically, the added value of air plasma generated by in&#8197;situ discharge with respect to ozonation (ex situ discharge) is demonstrated using phenol and various phenol derivatives and mechanistic evidence for the prevailing role of hydroxyl radicals in the initial attack is presented. On the reduction front, the impressive performance of cold plasma in inducing the degradation of recalcitrant perfluoroalkyl substances, which do not react with OH radicals but are attacked by electrons, is reported and discussed. The widely different reactivities of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and of perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) underline the crucial role played in these processes by the interface between plasma and solution and the surfactant properties of the treated pollutants.

         <title>Zn&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Using Triptycene Hexacarboxylate Ligands: Synthesis, Structure, and Gas&#8208;Sorption Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two types of zinc MOF, Zn&#8208;X2Trp and Zn&#8208;X2PET (X=H, F, Cl, Br, I, Me, Et, Pr), with difunctionalized triptycene&#8208;hexacarboxylate ligands H6X2Trp and H6X2PET that differ in size have been synthesized. All of these Zn&#8208;MOFs show high thermal stability as well as H2&#8208; and CO2&#8208;adsorption capacities. Moreover, MOFs with smaller pore size showed higher H2 and CO2 adsorption. Thus, the introduction of methyl, chloro, and bromo substituents at the bridgehead positions of the triptycene ligands enhances the H2&#8208; and CO2&#8208;adsorption capacities.







Abstract
A series of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) based on zinc ions and two triptycene ligands of different size have been synthesized under solvothermal conditions. Structural analyses revealed that they are isostructural 3D&#8208;network MOFs. The high porosity and thermal stability of these MOFs can be attributed to the highly rigid triptycene&#8208;based ligands. Their BET specific surface areas depend on the size of the triptycene ligands. In contrast to these surface&#8208;area data, the H2 and CO2 adsorption of these MOFs is larger for MOFs with small pores. Consequently, we introduced functional groups to the bridge&#8208;head position of the triptycene ligands and investigated their effect on the gas&#8208;sorption properties. The results unveiled the role of the functional groups in the specific CO2 binding via an induced interaction between adsorbates and the functional groups. Excellent H2 and CO2 properties in these MOFs were achieved in the absence of open metal sites.

         <title>Aluminium and Gallium Silylimides as Nitride Sources
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Terminal aluminium and gallium silylimides have been accessed for the first time by exploiting the oxidative reactions of anionic aluminium(I)/gallium(I) (&#8216;aluminyl&#8217;/&#8217;gallyl&#8217;) reagent with silylazides. These compounds feature minimal M=N &#960;&#8208;bonding and can be shown to act as sources of the nitride ion, [N]3&#8722; in reactions with CO or N2O.







Abstract
Terminal aluminium and gallium imides of the type K[(NON)M(NR)], bearing heteroatom substituents at R, have been synthesised via reactions of anionic aluminium(I) and gallium(I) reagents with silyl and boryl azides (NON=4,5&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropyl&#8208;anilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;xanthene). These systems vary significantly in their lability in solution: the N(SiiPr3) and N(Boryl) complexes are very labile, on account of the high basicity at nitrogen. Phenylsilylimido derivatives provide greater stabilization through the &#960;&#8208;acceptor capabilities of the SiR3 group. K[(NON)AlN(SitBuPh2)] offers a workable compromise between stability and solubility, and has been completely characterized by spectroscopic, analytical and crystallographic methods. The silylimide species examined feature minimal &#960;&#8208;bonding between the imide ligand and aluminium/gallium, with the HOMO and HOMO&#8208;1 orbitals effectively comprising orthogonal lone pairs centred at N. Reactivity&#8208;wise, both aluminium and gallium silylimides can act as viable sources of nitride, [N]3&#8722;, with systems derived from either metal reacting with CO to afford cyanide complexes. By contrast, only the gallium system K[(NON)Ga{N(SiPh3)}] is capable of effecting a similar transformation with N2O to yield azide, N3&#8722;, via formal oxide/nitride metathesis. The aluminium systems instead generate RN3 via transfer of the imide fragment [RN]2&#8722;.

         <title>Beryllium&#8208;Mediated Halide and Aryl Transfer onto Silicon</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ring opening of hexamethylcyclotrisoloxane with BeBr2, BeI2 and BePh2 was observed. These reactions yielded previously unknown diorgano bromo and iodo silanolates, [Be3Br2(OSiMe2Br)4] and [Be3I2(OSiMe2I)4], respectively, as well as [Be3Ph2(OSiMe2Ph)4]. Hydrolysis of these beryllium silanolates revealed that dimethyl bromo and iodo silanol are unstable and react to various cyclic cyclosiloxanes.







Abstract
The reactivity of hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane (D3) towards BeCl2, BeBr2, BeI2 and [Be3Ph6]3 was investigated. While BeCl2 only showed unselective reactivity, BeBr2, BeI2 and [Be3Ph6] cleanly react to the trinuclear complexes [Be3Br2(OSiMe2Br)4], [Be3I2(OSiMe2I)4] and [Be3Ph2(OSiMe2Ph)4]. These unprecedented bromide, iodide and phenyl transfer reactions from a group II metal onto silicon offer a versatile access to previously unknown diorgano bromo and iodo silanolates.

         <title>Polyfluoroalkyl Chain&#8208;Based Assemblies for Biomimetic Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amphiphobic fluoroalkyl chains are exploited for creating robust and diverse self&#8208;assembled biomimetic catalysts in aqueous solution. Long terminal perfluoroalkyl chains (CnF2n+1 with n = 6, 8, and 10) yoked with a short perhydroalkyl chains (CmH2m with m = 2 and 3) were used to synthesize several 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane (TACN) derivatives, CnF2n+1&#8208;CmH2m&#8208;TACN. In the presence of an equimolar amount of Zn2+ ions that coordinate the TACN moiety and drive the self&#8208;assembly into micelle&#8208;like aggregates, the critical aggregation concentration of polyfluorinated CnF2n+1&#8208;CmH2mTACN&#183;Zn2+ was lowered by ~1 order of magnitude compared to the traditional perhyroalkyl counterpart with identical carbon number of alkyl chain. When 2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxypropyl&#8208;4&#8208;nitrophenyl phosphate was used as the model phosphate substrate, polyfluorinated CnF2n+1CmH2m&#8208;TACN&#183;Zn2+ assemblies showed higher affinity and catalytic activity, compared to its perhyroalkyl chain&#8208;based counterpart. Coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamic simulations have been introduced to explore the supramolecular assembly of polyfluoroalkyl chains in the presence of Zn2+ ions and to better understand their enhanced catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Homocubane, a highly strained cage hydrocarbon, contains two very different positions for the introduction of a nitrogen atom into the skeleton, e.g., a position 1 exchange results in a tertiary amine whereas position 9 yields a secondary amine. Herein reported is the synthesis of 9&#8208;azahomocubane along with associated structural characterization, physical property analysis and chemical reactivity. Not only is 9&#8208;azahomocubane readily synthesized, and found to be stable as predicted, the basicity of the secondary amine was observed to be significantly lower than the structurally related azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, although similar to 1&#8208;azahomocubane.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;free Covalent organic frameworks for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the key reaction in metal air and fuel cells. Among the catalysts towards ORR, carbon&#8208;based metal&#8208;free catalysts are getting more attention because of their maximum atom utilization, effective active sites and satisfactory catalytic activity and stability. However, the pyrolysis synthesis of these carbons resulted in disordered porosities and uncontrolled catalytic sites, which hindered us to achieve the catalysts&#8217; properties previously, and build the structure&#8211;property relationship at molecular level. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) constructed with designable building blocks have been employed as metal free electrocatalysts towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to their controlled skeletons, tailored pores size and environments, and well&#8208;defined location and kinds of catalytic sites. In this concept article, the development of metal&#8208;free COFs for ORR is summarized, and different strategies including skeletons regulation, linkages engineering and edge&#8208;sites modulation to improve the catalytic selectivity and activity are discussed. Furthermore, this Concept provides prospective for design and construction high electrocatalysts based on the catalytic COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimization of 3D synthetic scaffolds for neuronal tissue engineering applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The increasing prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases has spurred researchers to develop advanced 3D models that accurately mimic neural tissues. Hydrogels stand out as ideal candidates as their properties closely resemble those of the extracellular matrix. A critical challenge in this regard is to comprehend the influence of the scaffold's mechanical properties on cell growth and differentiation, thus enabling targeted modifications. In light of this, a synthesis and comprehensive analysis of acrylamide&#8208;based hydrogels incorporating a peptide has been conducted. Adequate cell adhesion and development is achieved due to their bioactive nature and specific interactions with cellular receptors. The integration of a precisely controlled physicochemical hydrogel matrix and inclusion of the arginine&#8208;glycine&#8208;aspartic acid peptide sequence has endowed this system with an optimal structure, thus providing a unique ability to interact effectively with biomolecules. The analysis fully examined essential properties governing cell behavior, including pore size, mechanical characteristics, and swelling ability. Cell&#8208;viability experiments were performed to assess the hydrogel&#8217;s biocompatibility, while the incorporation of grow factors aimed to promote the differentiation of neuroblastoma cells. The results underscore the hydrogel&#8217;s ability to stimulate cell viability and differentiation in the presence of the peptide within the matrix.</dc:description>

         <title>Reticular Synthesis of Flexible Rare&#8208;Earth Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Control of Structural Dynamics and Sorption Properties Through Ligand Functionalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An exciting direction in metal&#8208;organic frameworks involves the design and synthesis of flexible structures which can reversibly adapt their structure when triggered by external stimuli. Controlling the extent and nature of response in such solids is critical in order to develop custom dynamic materials for advanced applications. Towards this, it is highly important to expand the diversity of existing flexible MOFs, generating novel materials and gain an in&#8208;depth understanding of the associated dynamic phenomena, eventually unlocking key structure&#8208;property relationships. In the present work, we successfully utilized reticular chemistry for the construction of two novel series of highly crystalline, flexible rare&#8208;earth MOFs, RE&#8208;thc&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 and RE&#8208;teb&#8208;MOF&#8208;1. Extensive single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal structural analyses coupled with detailed gas and vapor sorption studies, shed light onto the unique responsive behavior. The development of these series is related to the reported RE&#8208;thc&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 solids which were found to display a unique continuous breathing and gas&#8208;trapping property.

Controlling the extent and nature of response in such solids is critical in order to develop custom dynamic materials for advanced applications. Towards this, it is highly important to expand the diversity of existing flexible MOFs, generating novel materials and gain an in-depth understanding of the associated dynamic phenomena, eventually unlocking key structure-property relationships. In the present work, we successfully utilized reticular chemistry for the construction of two novel series of highly crystalline, flexible rare-earth MOFs, RE-thc-MOF-2 and RE-teb-MOF-1. Extensive single-crystal to single-crystal structural analyses coupled with detailed gas and vapor sorption studies, shed light onto the unique responsive behavior. The development of these series is related to the reported RE-thc-MOF-1 solids which were found to display a unique continuous breathing and gas-trapping property. The synthesis of RE-thc-MOF-2 and RE-teb-MOF-1 materials represents an important milestone as they provide important insights into the key factors that control the responsive properties of this fascinating family of flexible materials and demonstrates that it is possible to control their dynamic behavior and the associated gas and vapor sorption properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Homoleptic and heteroleptic copper(I) complexes were anchored on silica nanoparticles and used for the visible&#8208;light mediated &#945;&#8208;arylation of enol acetate.Photo&#8208;Catalyzed alpha&#8208;Arylation of Enol Acetate Using Recyclable Silica&#8208;Supported Heteroleptic and Homoleptic Copper(I) Photosensitizers (Troian&#8208;Gautier, Riant, Hermans et&#8197;al.)







Abstract
Earth&#8208;abundant photosensitizers are highly sought after for light&#8208;mediated applications, such as photoredox catalysis, depollution and energy conversion schemes. Homoleptic and heteroleptic copper(I) complexes are promising candidates in this field, as copper is abundant and the corresponding complexes are easily obtained in smooth conditions. However, some heteroleptic copper(I) complexes suffer from low (photo)stability that leads to the gradual formation of the corresponding homoleptic complex. Such degradation pathways are detrimental, especially when recyclability is desired. This study reports a novel approach for the heterogenization of homoleptic and heteroleptic Cu complexes on silica nanoparticles. In both cases, the photophysical properties upon surface immobilization were only slightly affected. Excited&#8208;state quenching with aryl diazonium derivatives occurred efficiently (108&#8211;1010&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) with heterogeneous and homogeneous photosensitizers. Moderate but almost identical yields were obtained for the &#945;&#8208;arylation of enol acetate using the homoleptic complex in homogeneous or heterogeneous conditions. Importantly, the silica&#8208;supported photocatalysts were recycled with moderate loss in photoactivity over multiple experiments. Transient absorption spectroscopy confirmed that excited&#8208;state electron transfer occurred from the homogeneous and heterogeneous homoleptic copper(I) complexes to aryl diazonium derivatives, generating the corresponding copper(II) center that persisted for several hundreds of microseconds, compatible with photoredox catalysis applications.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Graphene Quantum Dots as Electrochemiluminescence&#8208;Emitting Species for Sensitive Detection of KRAS G12C Mutation via PET&#8208;RAFT
</title>

         <dc:description>
Nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene quantum dots (NGQDs) synthesized from different ratios of carbon and nitrogen sources have been systematically explored for their electrochemiluminescence (ECL) properties for the first time. And NGQDs as signal molecules combined with photo&#8208;induced electron/energy transfer reversible addition&#8208;fragment chain transfer (PET&#8208;RAFT) signal amplification strategy to construct a ECL biosensor for sensitive detection of KRAS G12C mutation was first reported.







Abstract
The levels of KRAS G12C point mutation is recognized to be closely related to the earlier diagnosis of non&#8208;small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here, based on nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene quantum dots (NGQDs) and photo&#8208;induced electron/energy transfer reversible addition&#8208;fragment chain transfer (PET&#8208;RAFT) signal amplification strategy, we fabricated a novel electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor for the detection of KRAS G12C mutation for the first time. NGQDs as ECL&#8208;emitting species with cathodic ECL were prepared by a simple calcination method. Firstly, KRAS G12C mutation DNA, i.&#8201;e., target DNA (tDNA), was captured by specific identification with hairpin DNA (hDNA). Then, PET&#8208;RAFT was initiated by blue light, and large numbers of monomers were successfully polymerized to form controllable polymer chains. Lastly, massive NGQDs was introduced via amidation reaction with N&#8208;(3&#8208;aminopropyl)methacrylamide hydrochloride (APMA), which significantly amplified the ECL signal intensity. Under optimal conditions, this biosensor achieved a good linear relationship between ECL intensity and logarithm of the levels of KRAS G12C mutation in the range from 10&#8197;fM to 10&#8197;nM. Moreover, this strategy exhibited high selectivity and excellent applicability for KRAS G12C mutation detection in the serum samples. Therefore, this biosensor has great potential in clinical diagnosis and practical application.

         <title>Slow Magnetization Relaxation in a Family of Triangular {CoIII2LnIII} Clusters: The Effect of Diamagnetic CoIII Ions on the LnIII Magnetic Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of heterometallic complexes, [CoIII2LnIII(OMe)2(naph)2(O2CMe)3(MeOH)2] (Ln=Tb (1), Dy (2), and Er (3)), possessing a rare {CoIII2Ln(&#956;3&#8208;OMe)}8+ triangular core, have been prepared; compounds 2 and 3, as well as the magnetic diluted analogue {Co2Dy0.05Y0.95} (2&#8201;a), behave as mononuclear single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) with Ueff up to ~90&#8197;K.







Abstract
The first use of the Schiff base chelate N&#8208;naphthalidene&#8208;o&#8208;aminophenol (naphH2) in Co/Ln chemistry has afforded a family of isostructural [CoIII2LnIII(OMe)2(naph)2(O2CMe)3(MeOH)2] (Ln=Tb, Dy and Er) complexes, revealing a rare {CoIII2Ln(&#956;3&#8208;OMe)}8+ triangular core composed of two diamagnetic CoIII ions and a 4f&#8208;ion with slightly distorted square antiprismatic geometry. Alternating current (ac) magnetic susceptibility studies revealed that {Co2Dy}, and its magnetic diluted analogue {Co2Dy0.05Y0.95}, behave as mononuclear single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) with similar energy barriers for the magnetization reversal, Ueff, of ~85&#8208;90&#8197;K. SMM properties were also detected for {Co2Er}, with the compound exhibiting a Ueff of 18.7&#8197;K under an applied magnetic field of 800&#8197;Oe. To interpret the experimental magnetic results, ab initio CASSCF/RASSI&#8208;SO and DFT calculations were performed as a means of exploring the single&#8208;ion characteristics of LnIII ions and comprehend the role of the diamagnetic CoIII ions in the magnetization relaxation of the three heterometallic compounds.

         <title>Synthesis of Partially Fluorinated Alkyl Triflates by Electrochemical Fluorination (Simons Process)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrosynthesis of partially fluorinated alkyl triflates and nonaflates by using electrochemical fluorination (ECF) has been developed; it provides access to CF3SO2OCH2F and CF3SO2OCHF2 as well as their deuterated analogs. Selected ethyl triflates and nonaflates are also accessible through ECF.







Abstract
A scalable straightforward synthesis of monofluoro&#8208; and difluoromethyl triflate CF3SO2OCH2F (MH2F) and CF3SO2OCHF2 (MHF2) through electrochemical fluorination (ECF, Simons process) of methyl triflate MH3 in anhydrous hydrogen fluoride at nickel anodes is presented. The ECF method is also feasible for the preparation of the deuterated analogues CF3SO2OCD2F (MD2F) and CF3SO2OCDF2 (MD2F). Surprisingly, no H/D exchange occurs during ECF of CF3SO2OCD3 (MD3); this provides further evidence for a NiF3/NiF4&#8208;mediated ECF mechanism. The ECF of selected partially fluorinated ethyl triflates is described, and electrochemical fluorination of CF3SO2OCH2CF3 (EH2F3) leads to the until now unknown chiral CF3SO2OCHFCF3 (EHFF3). The analogous fluoromethyl and fluoroethyl nonaflates are also accessible by ECF. This study contains detailed spectroscopic, structural, and thermal data on (fluoro)methyl and fluoro(ethyl) triflates.

&lt;p&gt;The electrosynthesis of partially fluorinated alkyl triflates and nonaflates by using electrochemical fluorination (ECF) has been developed; it provides access to CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F and CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OCHF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as well as their deuterated analogs. Selected ethyl triflates and nonaflates are also accessible through ECF.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A scalable straightforward synthesis of monofluoro- and difluoromethyl triflate CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F (&lt;b&gt;M&lt;sup&gt;H2F&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;) and CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OCHF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;M&lt;sup&gt;HF2&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;) through electrochemical fluorination (ECF, Simons process) of methyl triflate &lt;b&gt;M&lt;sup&gt;H3&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; in anhydrous hydrogen fluoride at nickel anodes is presented. The ECF method is also feasible for the preparation of the deuterated analogues CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OCD&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F (&lt;b&gt;M&lt;sup&gt;D2F&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;) and CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OCDF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;M&lt;sup&gt;D2F&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;). Surprisingly, no H/D exchange occurs during ECF of CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OCD&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;M&lt;sup&gt;D3&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;); this provides further evidence for a NiF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/NiF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated ECF mechanism. The ECF of selected partially fluorinated ethyl triflates is described, and electrochemical fluorination of CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;E&lt;sup&gt;H2F3&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;) leads to the until now unknown chiral CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OCHFCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;E&lt;sup&gt;HFF3&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;). The analogous fluoromethyl and fluoroethyl nonaflates are also accessible by ECF. This study contains detailed spectroscopic, structural, and thermal data on (fluoro)methyl and fluoro(ethyl) triflates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Photochromic Phosphines by Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Annulation Reaction of Alkynes Bearing Phosphinyl Substituent with a Silacyclopropene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A methodological approach for the preparation of unconventional DTE&#8208;based photochromic phosphines is reported. It relies on the Pd&#8208;catalyzed annulation reaction of alkynyl phosphines in the presence of a silirene.







Abstract
The synthesis of phosphines with light controlled basicity is presented in this study. A methodological approach for the preparation of these unconventional photochromic phosphines based on a dithienylethene organic moiety is reported. It relies on the palladium&#8208;catalyzed annulation of alkynyl phosphines in the presence of a 2,3&#8208;Dithienylsilacyclopropene. Accordingly, a diphenyphosphino moiety is connected to the organic photochrome thanks to different linkers. Their influence on the photochromism and on the phosphinyl group basicity is studied and evaluated based on experimental an NMR descriptor as well as DFT calculations.

         <title>Tailoring the CO2 Hydrogenation Performance of Fe&#8208;Based Catalyst via Unique Confinement Effect of the Carbon Shell</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Core&#8208;shell structured Fe&#8208;based catalyst Na&#8722;Fe3O4@C with confinement effect delivered higher productivity of light olefins compared with the naked Na&#8722;Fe2O3 counterpart. Multiple characterization and DFT calculation verified that the timely carbon chain&#8208;growth termination, as well as unique CO2/H2 ratio and electronic property on the catalytic interface played vital roles in boosting light olefins synthesis.







Abstract
Even though Fe&#8208;based catalysts have been widely employed for CO2 hydrogenation into hydrocarbons, oxygenates, liquid fuels, etc., the precise regulation of their physicochemical properties is needed to enhance the catalytic performance. Herein, under the guidance of the traditional concept in heterogeneous catalysis&#8208;confinement effect, a core&#8208;shell structured catalyst Na&#8722;Fe3O4@C is constructed to boost the CO2 hydrogenation performance. Benefiting from the carbon&#8208;chain growth limitation, tailorable H2/CO2 ratio on the catalytic interface, and unique electronic property that all endowed by the confinement effect, the selectivity and space&#8208;time yield of light olefins (C2=&#8722;C4=) are as high as 47.4&#8201;% and 15.9&#8197;g&#8201;molFe&#8722;1&#8197;h&#8722;1, respectively, which are all notably higher than that from the shell&#8208;less counterpart. The function mechanism of the confinement effect in Fe&#8208;based catalysts are clarified in detail by multiple characterization and density functional theory (DFT). This work may offer a new prospect for the rational design of CO2 hydrogenation catalyst.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Electrochemical Reduction of Disulfides in an Undivided Cell under Mass Transfer Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical reductive cleavage of disulfides has been accomplished without the need for sacrificial metal anodes or a divided cell. Excellent conversion and selectivity toward the corresponding thiol can be achieved by tuning the current density at the electrodes. Very high current density at the anode creates a mass transfer barrier that impedes re&#8208;oxidation of the thiol generated at the cathode.







Abstract
Electroorganic synthesis is generally considered to be a green alternative to conventional redox reactions. Electrochemical reductions, however, are less advantageous in terms of sustainability, as sacrificial metal anodes are often employed. Divided cell operation avoids contact of the reduction products with the anode and allows for convenient solvent oxidation, enabling metal free greener electrochemical reductions. However, the ion exchange membranes required for divided cell operation on a commercial scale are not amenable to organic solvents, which hinders their applicability. Herein, we demonstrate that electrochemical reduction of oxidatively sensitive compounds can be carried out in an undivided cell without sacrificial metal anodes by controlling the mass transport to a small surface area electrode. The concept is showcased by an electrochemical method for the reductive cleavage of aryl disulfides. Fine tuning of the electrode surface area and current density has enabled the preparation of a wide variety of thiols without formation of any oxidation side products. This strategy is anticipated to encourage further research on greener, metal free electrochemical reductions.

         <title>Reductive Activation of Aryl Chlorides by Tuning the Radical Cation Properties of N&#8208;Phenylphenothiazines as Organophotoredox Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two photons are better than one: Intramolecular charge transfer in the intermediate radical cation of the N&#8208;phenylphenothiazines as photocatalysts improves the yields for borylation and phosphonylation of aryl chlorides.







Abstract
Aryl chlorides as substrates for arylations present a particular challenge for photoredox catalytic activation due to their strong C(sp2)&#8722;Cl bond and their strong reduction potential. Electron&#8208;rich N&#8208;phenylphenothiazines, as organophotoredox catalysts, are capable of cleaving aryl chlorides simply by photoinduced electron transfer without the need for an additional electrochemical activation setup or any other advanced photocatalysis technique. Due to the extremely strong reduction potential in the excited state of the N&#8208;phenylphenothiazines the substrate scope is high and includes aryl chlorides both with electron&#8208;withdrawing and electron&#8208;donating substituents. We evidence this reactivity for photocatalytic borylations and phosphonylations. Advanced time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy in combination with electrochemistry was the key to elucidating and comparing the unusual photophysical properties not only of the N&#8208;phenylphenothiazines, but also of their cation radicals as the central intermediates in the photocatalytic cycle. The revealed photophysics allowed the excited&#8208;state and radical&#8208;cation properties to be fine&#8208;tuned by the molecular design of the N&#8208;phenylphenothiazines; this improved the photocatalytic activity.

         <title>Water&#8208;Soluble Arylazoisoxazole Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;soluble arylazoisoxazoles are introduced as an additional scaffold to the existing arylazoheteroarenes and open the door for tailor&#8208;made properties in molecular and materials chemistry. They were found to combine excellent photochromic behavior with long thermal life times. Supramolecular aggregates were formed by host&#8211;guest interaction and gelation.







Abstract
Azoheteroarenes are emerging as powerful alternatives to azobenzene molecular photoswitches. In this study, water&#8208;soluble arylazoisoxazole photoswitches are introduced. UV/vis and NMR spectroscopy revealed moderate to very good photostationary states and reversible photoisomerization between the E&#8208; and Z&#8208;isomers over multiple cycles with minimal photobleaching. Several arylazoisoxazoles form host&#8211;guest complexes with &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin with significant differences in binding constants for each photoisomer as shown by isothermal titration calorimetry and NMR experiments, indicating their potential for photoresponsive host&#8211;guest chemistry in water. One carboxylic acid functionalized arylazoisoxazole can act as a hydrogelator, allowing gel properties to be manipulated reversibly with light. The hydrogel was characterized by rheological experiments, atom force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. These results demonstrate that arylazoisoxazoles can find applications as molecular photoswitches in aqueous media.

         <title>Improved Catalytic Performance toward Selective Oxidation of Benzyl Alcohols Originated from New Open&#8208;Framework Copper Molybdovanadate with a Unique V/Mo Ratio</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper molybdovanadate with mixed&#8208;valent vanadium (V4+/V5+=4/3) and molybdenum (Mo5+/Mo6+=8/2) cations exhibits improved catalytic activity (conv.: 96.8&#8201;%) compared with the complex (Cpyr)5PV2Mo5W5O40 [conv.: 88.51&#8201;%, Cpyr=(C16H32C5H4N)+)] and could serve as a highly efficient heterogeneous catalyst in the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohols to benzaldehydes.







Abstract
A new organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid open&#8208;framework molybdovanadate with mixed&#8208;valences of vanadium (V4+/V5+=4/3) and molybdenum (Mo5+/Mo6+=8/2) cations has been synthesized. The complex possesses the unique V/Mo ratio (7/10), fascinating 8&#8208;C topological network and 1D 4&#8208;MR channels (7.793&#8197;&#197;&#215;6.699&#8197;&#197;). Importantly, its catalytic activities for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde (oxidant: H2O2, 30&#8201;wt&#8201;%) have been well evaluated. The results indicated that it exhibited improved catalytic activities (conv.: 96.8&#8201;%) compared with the catalyst (Cpyr)5PV2Mo5W5O40 [conv.: 88.51&#8201;%, Cpyr=(C16H32C5H4N)+)], high recyclability and structural stability. Moreover, the conversions and selectivities (conv.: 82.4&#8211;92.5&#8201;%; sele.: 91.5&#8211;95.7&#8201;%) of the substrates containing electron donating groups (&#8722;OH, &#8722;CH3, &#8722;OCH3 and &#8722;Cl) were significantly higher than those of the substrate containing electron withdrawing group (&#8722;NO2) (conv. 67.4&#8201;%; sele.: 80.8&#8201;%). This is due to the fact that the &#8722;NO2 with a large Hammett substituent constant is not conducive to the generation of transition state products. The studies revealed the complex could act as a highly efficient heterogeneous catalyst in selective oxidation of benzyl alcohols.

         <title>Sulfone/Carbonyl&#8208;Based Donor&#8208;Acceptor Fluorescent Dyes: Synthesis, Structures, Photophysical Properties and Cell Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfone or carbonyl&#8208;based acceptor units were used to construct donor&#8208;acceptor conjugate organic fluorophores. Both TPA&#8208;SO and TPA&#8208;CO have solvent polarity&#8208;dependent photophysical properties for strong intramolecular charge transfer. As sulfone has weak intersystem crossing ability, TPA&#8208;SO has high fluorescence efficiency in solution and nanoparticles, and is a promising fluorescence dye.







Abstract
Electron&#8208;accepting units play vital roles in constructing donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) conjugated organic optoelectronic materials; the electronic structures and functions of the acceptors need to be carefully unveiled to controllably tailor the optoelectronic properties. We have synthesized two D&#8208;A conjugated organic fluorophores, TPA&#8208;SO and TPA&#8208;CO, with similar molecular skeletons based on sulfone&#8208; or carbonyl&#8208;containing polycyclic aromatic acceptors. Both TPA&#8208;SO and TPA&#8208;CO display obvious solvent polarity&#8208;dependent photophysical properties and large Stokes shift of over 100&#8197;nm for strong intramolecular charge transfer processes. Experimental evidence indicates that the sulfone group in TPA&#8208;SO merely serves as a strong electron&#8208;withdrawing unit. TPA&#8208;SO shows yellowish&#8208;green emission with a peak at 542&#8197;nm and an absolute photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 98&#8201;% in solution, whereas the carbonyl group in TPA&#8208;CO can act as both an electron&#8208;withdrawing unit and spin transition convertor, so TPA&#8208;CO displays red emission with a low absolute PLQY of 0.32&#8201;% in solution. Impressively, upon going from solution to aggregate state, TPA&#8208;SO nanoparticles keep a high PLQY of 9.5&#8201;% and moderate biocompatibility, thus they are good nano&#8208;agents for cellular fluorescence imaging. The results reveal that the inherent acceptor characteristic acts as a crucial effect in the photophysical properties and applications of the organic fluorophores.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Living Supramolecular Polymerization: Improvement in Edge Roughness of Supramolecular Nanosheets by Using a Dummy Monomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled/living supramolecular polymerization has enabled the synthesis of well&#8208;defined nanostructures which are otherwise inaccessible under thermodynamically controlled, spontaneous self&#8208;assembly process. Yet, there is still room for improvement; here we show two&#8208;dimensional living supramolecular polymerization improved using an additive, which permits the synthesis of supramolecular nanosheets of better quality.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymers are formed through nucleation (i.&#8201;e., initiation) and polymerization processes, and kinetic control over the nucleation process has recently led to the realization of living supramolecular polymerization. Changing the viewpoint, herein we focus on controlling the polymerization process, which we expect to pave the way to further developments in controlled supramolecular polymerization. In our previous study, two&#8208;dimensional living supramolecular polymerization was used to produce supramolecular nanosheets with a controlled area; however, these had rough edges. In this study, the growth of the nanosheets was controlled by using a &#8216;dummy&#8217; monomer to produce supramolecular nanosheets with smoothed edges.

         <title>Germanium(II) Dithiolene Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemistry at the germylene and dithiolene interface has rarely been explored. Here, we report a series of Lewis base&#8208;coordinated germanium(II) dithiolene complexes. Controlled hydrolysis of the carbene&#8208;coordinated germanium(II) dithiolene complex affords a dianionic bis&#8208;dithiolene&#8208;based germanium(II) species.







Abstract
The 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 reaction of the imidazole&#8208;based dithiolate (2) with GeCl2&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;dioxane in THF/TMEDA gives 3, a TMEDA&#8208;complexed dithiolene&#8208;based germylene. Compound 3 is converted to monothiolate&#8208;complexed (5) and N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;complexed (7) germanium(II) dithiolene complexes via Lewis base ligand exchange. A bis&#8208;dithiolene&#8208;based germylene (8), involving a 3c&#8211;4e S&#8208;Ge&#8208;S bond, has also been synthesized through controlled hydrolysis of 7. The bonding nature of 3, 5, and 8 was investigated by both experimental and theoretical methods.

     alt="Germanium(II) Dithiolene Complexes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chemistry at the germylene and dithiolene interface has rarely been explored. Here, we report a series of Lewis base-coordinated germanium(II) dithiolene complexes. Controlled hydrolysis of the carbene-coordinated germanium(II) dithiolene complex affords a dianionic bis-dithiolene-based germanium(II) species.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 reaction of the imidazole-based dithiolate (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) with GeCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;dioxane in THF/TMEDA gives &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;, a TMEDA-complexed dithiolene-based germylene. Compound &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; is converted to monothiolate-complexed (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;) and N-heterocyclic carbene-complexed (&lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;) germanium(II) dithiolene complexes via Lewis base ligand exchange. A bis-dithiolene-based germylene (&lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt;), involving a 3c&#8211;4e S-Ge-S bond, has also been synthesized through controlled hydrolysis of &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;. The bonding nature of &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt; was investigated by both experimental and theoretical methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Vapor&#8208;Induced Assembly of a Platinum(II) Complex Loaded on Layered Double Hydroxide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Changes in the assembly of PtII complexes on layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoparticles. Under dry conditions, PtII complexes are attached to the LDH nanoparticles like starfish on the rocks, and exhibit a monomer&#8208;derived green emission. Under humid conditions, the mobility of PtII complexes increases due to the adsorption of water, like fish swimming among the rocks, resulting in an assembly&#8208;derived orange emission. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Yoshida, M. Kato and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301993). Cover art by Hibiki Asahori.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The large&#8208;scale synthesis of cycloparaphenylene building blocks is illustrated. It represents the different syntheses in continuous flow and how the building blocks can be assembled. The final robotic arm allows aromatization to the macrocyclic CPP ring; the color change showing that all the phenyl units are now the same.

         <title>Mechanochemical Oxidative Coupling of Amine to Azo&#8208;based Polymers by Hypervalent Iodine Oxidant</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Among porous organic polymers (POPs), azo&#8208;linked POPs represent a crucial class of materials, making them the focus of numerous catalytic systems proposed for their synthesis. However, the synthetic process is limited to metal&#8208;catalyzed, high&#8208;temperature, and liquid&#8208;phase reactions. In this study, we employ mechanochemical oxidative metal&#8208;free systems to encompass various syntheses of azo&#8208;based polymers. Drawing inspiration from the "rule of six" principle (six or more carbons on azide group render the organic compound relatively safe), an azo compound featuring significant steric hindrance is obtained using the hypervalent iodine oxidation strategy. Furthermore, during the polymerization process, steric hindrance is enhanced in monomers to effectively prevent explosions resulting from direct contact between hypervalent iodine oxidants and primary amines. Indeed, this approach provides a facile and innovative solid&#8208;phase synthesis method for synthesizing azo&#8208;based materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Review: Direct Lithium Extraction Using Intercalation Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Worldwide lithium (Li) demand has surged in recent years due to increased production of Li&#8208;ion batteries for electric vehicles and stationary storage. Li supply and production will need to increase such that the transition towards increased electrification in the energy sector does not become cost prohibitive. Many countries have taken policy steps such as listing Li as a critical mineral. Current commercial Li mining is mostly from dedicated mine sources, including ores, clays, and brines. The conventional ways to extract Li+&#160;from those resources are through chemical processing. The environmental and economic sustainability of conventional Li processing has recently received increased scrutiny. Routes such as direct Li+&#160;extraction may provide advantages relative to conventional Li+&#160;extraction technologies, and one possible route to direct Li+&#160;extraction includes leveraging of intercalation materials. Intercalation material processing has recently demonstrated high selectivity towards Li+&#160;as opposed to other cations. Reviews and reports of direct Li+extraction with intercalation materials are limited, even as this technology has started to show promise in smaller scale demonstrations. This paper will review selective Li+&#160;extraction via intercalation materials, including both electrochemical and chemical methods to drive Li+&#160;in and out and efforts to characterize the Li+&#160;insertion/deinsertion processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Benzylic C(sp3)&#8208;H bond oxidation with ketone selectivity by a cobalt(IV)&#8208;oxo embedded in a &#946;&#8208;barrel protein</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial metalloenzymes have emerged as biohybrid catalysts that allow to combine the reactivity of a metal catalyst with the flexibility of protein scaffolds. Here, we report the artificial metalloenzymes based on the &#946;&#8208;barrel protein nitrobindin NB4, in which a cofactor [CoIIX(Me3TACD&#8208;Mal)]+X&#8208; (X = Cl, Br; Me3TACD = N,N&#180;,N&#180;&#180;&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane, Mal = CH2CH2CH2NC4H2O2) was covalently anchored via a Michael addition reaction. These biohybrid catalysts showed higher efficiency than the free cobalt complexes for the oxidation of benzylic C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds in aqueous media. Using commercially available oxone (2KHSO5&#183;KHSO4&#183;K2SO4) as oxidant, a total turnover number of up to 220 and 97% ketone selectivity were achieved for tetralin. As catalytically active intermediate, a mononuclear terminal cobalt(IV)&#8208;oxo species [Co(IV)=O]2+ was generated by reacting the cobalt(II) cofactor with oxone in aqueous solution and characterized by ESI&#8208;TOF MS.</dc:description>

         <title>Acyclic Boryl Complexes of Copper(I)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reaction of (6&#8208;Dipp)CuOtBu (6&#8208;Dipp = C{NDippCH2}2CH2, Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) with B2(OMe)4 provided access to (6&#8208;Dipp)CuB(OMe)2 via &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis. (6&#8208;Dipp)CuB(OMe)2 was characterised by NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography and shown to be a monomeric acyclic boryl of copper. (6&#8208;Dipp)CuB(OMe)2 reacted with ethylene and diphenylacetylene to provide insertion compounds into the Cu&#8208;B bond which were characterised by NMR spectroscopy in both cases and X&#8208;ray crystallography in the latter. It was also competent in the rapid catalytic deoxygenation of CO2 in the presence of excess B2(OMe)4.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Reaction of (6-Dipp)CuOtBu (6-Dipp = C{NDippCH2}2CH2, Dipp = 2,6-iPr2C6H3) with B2(OMe)4 provided access to (6-Dipp)CuB(OMe)2 via &#963;-bond metathesis. (6-Dipp)CuB(OMe)2 was characterised by NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography and shown to be a monomeric acyclic boryl of copper. (6-Dipp)CuB(OMe)2 reacted with ethylene and diphenylacetylene to provide insertion compounds into the Cu-B bond which were characterised by NMR spectroscopy in both cases and X-ray crystallography in the latter. It was also competent in the rapid catalytic deoxygenation of CO2 in the presence of excess B2(OMe)4. Alongside &#960;-insertion, (6-Dipp)CuB(OMe)2 reacted with LiNMe2 to provide a salt metathesis reaction at boron, giving (6-Dipp)CuB(OMe)NMe2, a second monomeric acyclic boryl, which also cuproborated diphenylacetylene. Computational interrogation validated these acyclic boryl species to be electronically similar to (6-Dipp)CuBpin.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Allylic Alcohols via Substrate Control on Asymmetric Lithiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Allylic alcohols are a privileged motif in natural product synthesis and new methods that access them in a stereoselective fashion are highly sought after. Toward this goal, we found that chiral acetonide&#8208;protected polyketide fragments performing the Hoppe&#8211;Matteson&#8211;Aggarwal rearrangement in the absence of sparteine with high yields and diastereoselectivities rendering this protocol a highly valuable alternative to the Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Takai&#8211;Kishi reaction. Various stereodyads and &#8208;triads were investigated to determine their substrate induction. The mostly strong inherent stereoinduction was attributed to a combination of steric and electronic effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Conjugated Olefin Enabled Rollover Cyclometallation of Distant C&#8208;H Bonds: Regioselective Annulation of o&#8208;Alkenyl Phenols with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although challenging, the distant C&#8208;H functionalization with precision is quite rewarding and has long been intriguing. Tailoring an appropriate template accomplishes the job but the prerequisite sets the limitation. We herein unveil our discovery of annulation of alkynes on to two distant (from directing group) C&#8208;H bonds through rollover cyclometallation assisted by conjugated C=C bond. The annulation follows a concomitant cyclization rewarding a rare triple C&#8208;H functionalization. The annulation is totally regioselective with an array of unsymmetrical alkynes, taking the leverage of an extended conjugation or a tertiary hydroxyl co&#8208;ordination. The mechanism is supported by control experiments, KIE &amp; labelling studies and Mass spectrometry.</dc:description>

         <title>Living Self&#8208;Assembly of Metastable and Stable Two&#8208;Dimensional Platelets from a Single Small Molecule</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study reports the design of a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) molecule with two fluorene units on each side of a benzothiadiazole moiety, which allows multiple intermolecular interactions to compete with one another so as to induce the evolution of the metastable 2D platelets to the stable 2D platelets during the self&#8208;assembly of the D&#8208;A molecule. Importantly, the living seeded self&#8208;assembly of metastable and stable 2D structures with precisely controlled sizes can be conveniently achieved using an appropriate supersaturated solution of the D&#8208;A molecule as the seeded growth medium that can temporarily hold the almost&#8208;proceeding spontaneous nucleation from competing with the seeded growth. The stable 2D platelets with smaller area sizes exhibit higher sensitivity to gaseous dimethyl sulfide, illustrating that the novel living self&#8208;assembly method provides more available functional structures with controlled sizes for practical applications. The key finding of this study is that the new living methodology is separated into two independent processes: the elaborate molecular design for various crystalline structures as seeds and the application of an appropriate supersaturated solution as the growth medium to grow the uniform structures with controlled sizes; this would make convenient and possible the living seeded self&#8208;assembly of rich 1D, 2D, and 3D architectures.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and its global spread have created an unprecedented public health crisis. The spike protein of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 has gained significant attention due to its crucial role in viral entry into host cells and its potential as both a prophylactic and a target for therapeutic interventions. Herein, we report the first successful total synthesis of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD), highlighting the key challenges and the strategies employed to overcome them. Appropriate utilization of advanced solid phase peptide synthesis and cutting&#8208;edge native chemical ligation methods have facilitated the synthesis of the protein molecule. We discuss problems encountered during the chemical synthesis and approaches taken to optimize the yield and the purity of the synthetic protein molecule. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the chemically synthesized spike RBD efficiently binds to the known mini&#8208;protein binder LCB1. The successful chemical synthesis of the spike RBD presented here can be utilized to gain valuable insights into SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike RBD biology, advancing our understanding and aiding the development of intervention strategies to combat future coronavirus outbreaks. The modular synthetic approach described in this study can be effectively implemented in the synthesis of other mutated variants or enantiomer of spike RBD for mirror&#8208;image drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Dense NiCo2O4 Nanoneedles Grown on Carbon Foam Showing Excellent Electrochemical and Microwave Absorption Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electromagnetic pollution could harm sensitive electronic equipment due to the rising use of electronic devices and communication infrastructure. The supercapacitor's electrochemical performance should be enhanced, and electromagnetic damage should be prevented. This study proposes NiCo2O4/CF composites for supercapacitors and microwave absorption. They are made by combining hydrothermal and annealing processes. Dense NiCo2O4 nanoneedles were uniformly grown on the outer layer of carbon foam (CF) as a growth skeleton, preventing the agglomeration of NiCo2O4. The composite had a specific capacitance of 537.5 F/g at 1 A/g. When the current density was set to 1 A/g, the supercapacitor that used NiCo2O4/CF as the cathode had a specific capacitance of 70.7 F/g, and when the current density was increased to 10 A/g, the original specific capacitance of 87.2% could still be maintained after 5000 charge&#8208;discharge cycles. At a power density of 3695.5 W/kg, an energy density of 22.1 Wh/kg could be maintained. Furthermore, we performed a microwave absorption test and determined its reflection loss curve for various sample thicknesses. Recombination enhanced the composite material's microwave absorption capability by greatly reducing the dielectric loss and the magnetic loss.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electromagnetic pollution could harm sensitive electronic equipment due to the rising use of electronic devices and communication infrastructure. The supercapacitor's electrochemical performance should be enhanced, and electromagnetic damage should be prevented. This study proposes NiCo2O4/CF composites for supercapacitors and microwave absorption. They are made by combining hydrothermal and annealing processes. Dense NiCo2O4 nanoneedles were uniformly grown on the outer layer of carbon foam (CF) as a growth skeleton, preventing the agglomeration of NiCo2O4. The composite had a specific capacitance of 537.5 F/g at 1 A/g. When the current density was set to 1 A/g, the supercapacitor that used NiCo2O4/CF as the cathode had a specific capacitance of 70.7 F/g, and when the current density was increased to 10 A/g, the original specific capacitance of 87.2% could still be maintained after 5000 charge-discharge cycles. At a power density of 3695.5 W/kg, an energy density of 22.1 Wh/kg could be maintained. Furthermore, we performed a microwave absorption test and determined its reflection loss curve for various sample thicknesses. Recombination enhanced the composite material's microwave absorption capability by greatly reducing the dielectric loss and the magnetic loss.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Construction of [NbO]6&#8722;x&#8208;xS Structure to Change Charge Density and Regulate Spontaneous Polarization to Achieve Efficient Pyro&#8208;Photo&#8208;Electric Water Splitting System of NaNbO3</title>

The changed interaction between S&#8722;Nb&#8722;S in [NbO]6&#8722;x&#8208;xS structure, and the constructed [NbO]6&#8722;x&#8208;xS structure realized the regulation of charge density change and spontaneous polarization. S&#8208;doping weakens the S&#8722;Nb&#8722;S interaction in the [NbO]6&#8722;x&#8208;xS structure, which effectively improves the performance of the pyro&#8208;photo&#8208;electric synergistic water splitting system.







Abstract
Pyroelectric materials in the field of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting still face the problems of difficult low spontaneous polarization intensity and excessive carrier recombination. Based on the above problems, we altered the interaction between S&#8722;Nb&#8722;S in the [NbO]6&#8722;x&#8208;xS structure, and the constructed [NbO]6&#8722;x&#8208;xS structure achieved the regulation of charge density change and spontaneous polarization. The results show that under the stimulation of light and temperature fluctuations, the current density of the NS&#8208;4 photoanode is as high as 0.574&#8197;mA/cm2 at 1.23&#8197;VRHE, which is about 1.59&#8197;times higher than the pure NaNbO3 current density value, and the NS &#8722;4 photoanode achieves IPCE value of 16.08&#8201;%. The first&#8208;principles density&#8208;functional theory calculations (DFT) reveal the principle of the [NbO]6&#8722;x&#8208;xS structure for the suppression function of the carrier recombination and the improvement function of the pyroelectric effect. The analysis shows that the S&#8208;doping leads to the weakening of S&#8722;Nb&#8722;S interactions in the [NbO]6&#8722;x&#8208;xS structure, which improves the pyroelectric effect and suppresses the photo/pyro&#8208;generated carrier recombination, and effectively enhances the performance of the pyro&#8208;photo&#8208;electric synergistic water splitting system. This work promotes the development of pyroelectric materials in the field of photoelectrochemical water splitting.

         <title>Theoretical Prediction of Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2 Using a 2D Catalyst Composed of 3&#8201;d Transition Metal and Hexaamine Dipyrazino Quinoxaline</title>

Computational screening of 2D materials composed of 3d transition metal and hexaamine dipyrazino quinoxalineas efficient catalysts for carbon dioxide reduction reactions.







Abstract
Transition metals and organic ligands combine to form metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), which possess distinct active sites, large specific surface areas and stable porous structures, giving them considerable promise for CO2 reduction electrocatalysis. In the present study, using spin polarisation density&#8208;functional theory, a series of 2D MOFs constructed from 3d transition metal and hexamethylene dipyrazoline quinoxaline(HADQ) were investigated. The calculated binding energies between HADQ and metal atoms for the ten TM&#8208;HADQ monolayers were strong sufficient to stably disperse the metal atoms in the HADQ monolayers. Of the ten catalysts tested, seven (Sc, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ti, V and Cr) exhibited high CO2 reduction selectivity, while Mn, Fe and Co required pH values above 2.350, 6.461 and 6.363, respectively, to exhibit CO2 reduction selectivity. HCOOH was the most important producer for Sc, Zn, Ni and Mn, while CH4 was the main producer for Ti, Cr, Fe and V. Cu and Co were less selective, producing HCHO, CH3OH, and CH4 simultaneously at the same rate&#8208;determining step and limiting potential. The Cu&#8208;HADQ catalyst had a high overpotential for the HCHO product (1.022&#8197;V), while the other catalysts had lower overpotentials between 0.016&#8197;V and 0.792&#8197;V. Thus, these results predict TM&#8208;HADQ to show excellent activity in CO2 electrocatalytic reduction and to become a promising electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction.

         <title>Binary Metallic CuCo5S8 Anode for High Volumetric Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binary metallic CuCo5S8 is successfully synthesized and evaluated as a CA&#8208;free anode in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Because of the metallic properties of the material, the CA&#8208;free anode exhibits superior rate and cyclic performances. The high electrode density and multi&#8208;electron transfer during the charge&#8208;discharge process enable CuCo5S8 anode to display an outstanding volumetric capacity.







Abstract
With the rapid improvement of compact smart devices, fabricating anode materials with high volumetric capacity has gained substantial interest for future sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) applications. Herein, a novel bimetal sulfide CuCo5S8 material is proposed with enhanced volumetric capacity due to the intrinsic metallic electronic conductivity of the material and multi&#8208;electron transfer during electrochemical procedures. Due to the intrinsic metallic behavior, the conducting additive (CA) could be removed from the electrode fabrication without scarifying the high rate capability. The CA&#8208;free CuCo5S8 electrode can achieve a high volumetric capacity of 1436.4&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;cm&#8722;3 at a current density of 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 100&#8201;% capacity retention over 2000&#8197;cycles in SIBs, outperforming most metal chalcogenides, owing to the enhanced electrode density. Reversible conversion reactions are revealed by combined measurements for sodium systems. The proposed new strategy offers a viable approach for developing innovative anode materials with high&#8208;volumetric capacity.

         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free natural dye has been developed to selectively convert methane to methyl trifluoroacetate (CH3TFA) using visible light, probably due to the formation of a chloride&#8208;bridged dimer undergoing fast intra&#8208;complex charge transfer.

They were used for transfer hydrogenations to aldehydes, ketones, imines as well as electron&#8208;poor alkene/alkyne moieties. The amine&#8208;borane Lewis&#8208;paired oligomers and the congested bis(amine&#8208;borane)s provided the highest yields. This was likely helped by facilitated dissociation (oligomers) or H&#8208;bond assistance. In the case of the oligomers, the second equivalent of H2 present was also engaged in the reaction. Solid&#8208;state NMR characterization provides evidence that the Boron&#8208;containing materials obtained after transfer dehydrogenation are highly similar to those obtained from thermal dehydrogenation. The oligomers bridge the gap between simple amine&#8208;borane molecular reductants and the poly&#8208;amine&#8208;boranes and provide a full picture of the reactivity changes at the different scales.</dc:description>

         <title>Bimetallic Manganese Catalysts: A Route to Controlled and Switchable Polymerization of Lactones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sustainable solution to the environmental problem of polymeric materials calls for efficient and well&#8208;controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization catalytic systems. Inspired by the highly reactive and stereospecific bimetallic catalysts, three kinds of bimetallic Salen&#8208;Mn catalysts supported by biaryl linking moieties are synthesized and applied to polymerization catalysis of lactide (LA) and &#949;&#8208;caprolactone (&#949;&#8208;CL) in this work. The polymerization is initiated in situ by the ring&#8208;opening of epoxide compounds, in which the ionic cocatalyst could accelerate the reaction process. The Mn&#8208;Mn coordination effect contributes to the higher activity and iso&#8208;selectivity towards LA compared to the mononuclear Salen&#8208;Mn catalyst. The reactivity and stereoselectivity are determined by the conformation of catalysts, specifically the Mn&#8208;Mn separation and dihedral angle. Finally, the CO2&#8208;controlled switchable polymerizations are carried out with LA and &#949;&#8208;CL. The reversibility of the on&#8208;off switching operation is influenced by the combination between CO2 molecules and active species. The success in binuclear Salen&#8208;Mn catalysts not only expands the range of bimetallic catalyst analogues but also claims the promising potential of Mn&#8208;based catalysts in practical and theoretical research.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Accessibility and Diffusion of Resorufin in Zeolite Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We use confocal laser scanning microscopy on the small, fluorescent resorufin dye molecule to visualize molecular accessibility and diffusion in the hierarchical, anisotropic pore structure of large (~10 &#181;m&#8208;sized) zeolite&#8208;&#946; crystals. The resorufin dye is widely used in life and materials science, but only in its deprotonated form because the protonated molecule is barely fluorescent in aqueous solution. In this work, we show that protonated resorufin is in fact strongly fluorescent when confined within the zeolite micropores enabling fluorescence microimaging experiments. We find that J&#8208;aggregation guest&#8211;guest interactions lead to a decrease in the measured fluorescence intensity, but is prevented by using non&#8208;fluorescent spacer molecules. By introducing resorufin from the outside solution and following its diffusion into zeolite&#8208;&#946; crystals, we characterize the pore space. The eventual homogeneous distribution of resorufin molecules throughout the zeolite indicates a fully accessible pore network. This enables the quantification of its diffusion coefficient in the straight pores of zeolite&#8208;&#946; without the need for complex analysis, and we find a value of 3 &#215; 10&#8722;15 m2 s&#8722;1. Furthermore, we visualize that diffusion through the straight pores of zeolite&#8208;&#946; is impeded when crossing the boundaries between zeolite sub&#8208;units.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Temperature&#8208;modulated colloidal phase of plasmonic nanoparticles is a convenient playground for resettable soft&#8208;actuators or colorimetric sensors.&#160;To render reversible clustering under temperature change, bulky ligands are required, especially if anisotropic morphologies are of interest.&#160;Here, we showcase thermoresponsive gold nanorods by employing small surface ligands, bis (p&#8208;sulfonatophenyl) phenyl&#8208;phosphine dihydrate dipotassium salt (BSPP) and native cationic surfactant.&#160;Temperature&#8208;dependent analysis in real&#8208;time allowed us to describe the structural features (interparticle distance and cluster size) as well as thermal parameters, melting and freezing temperatures. Our findings suggest that neither covalent Au&#8208;S bonds nor bulky ligands are required to obtain a robust thermoresponsive system based on anisotropic gold nanoparticles, paving the way to stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoparticles with a wide range of sizes and geometries.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed bis&#8208;Borylation of Quinolines: The Importance of the Cobalt Triplet State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein a mild stereo&#8208; and regioselective dearomatization of quinolines using the simple low valent HCo(N2)(PPh3)3 complex that exhibits labile ligands. Conditions to form selectively, at room temperature, high&#8208;valued 1,4&#8208;bis&#8208;borylated tetrahydroquinolines from simple starting heteroaromatic compounds have been developed. The efficient and selective functionalization of a large scope of quinolines bearing various electron&#8208;donating or electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents is presented, as well as the post&#8208;modification of the resulting C&#8211;B bond. NMR and labelling studies are consistent with a cascade mechanism pathway, starting from an in situ generated paramagnetic bis&#8208;quinoline cobalt(I) hydride complex. A first quinoline dearomatization followed by a cobalt(I)&#8208;catalyzed Markovnikov hydroboration of the remaining double bond allows the introduction of the boronic ester group only at C4 position. DFT calculations particularly highlight the importance of the cobalt triplet state throughout the reaction pathway, and bring some rationalization for the observed C4 selective borylation.</dc:description>

         <title>Hexaguanidino&#8208;Triptycenes and Triphenylenes: Electronic Coupling in Molecules Containing Three Redox&#8208;Active o&#8208;Diguanidinobenzene Units Connected either Directly or Interacting Through Homoconjucation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel redox&#8208;active hexaguanidine molecules with multiple redox states were synthesized by connecting three o&#8208;diguanidinobenzene units. In 2,3,6,7,14,15&#8208;hexaguanidino&#8208;triptycenes, the three redox&#8208;active o&#8208;diguanidinobenzene units are connected through C&#8208;C bonds to the sp3&#8208;hybridized bridgehead C atoms, and in 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexaguanidino&#8208;triphenylenes they are directly connected. The connectivity difference leads to different electronic coupling between the three redox&#8208;active o&#8208;diguanidinobenzene units, with homoconjugation being present in the triptycene, but not in the triphenylene compounds. Motivated by the appearance of an intense low&#8208;energy electronic transition, we especially analysed the effect of homoconjugation on the electronic structure and charge delocalization in the dicationic redox state of the triptycene derivatives. Then, several trinuclear high&#8208;spin cobalt (and copper) complexes were synthesized with the triphenylene and triptycene ligands, and the magnetic coupling and redox properties analysed. By choice of the coligands (hexafluoroacetylacetonate, trifluoroacetylacetonate and acetylacetonate), oxidation could be switched between metal&#8208; and ligand&#8208;centered redox events, leading to drastic changes in the magnetic or optical properties, especially as a consequence of homoconjugation in the triptycene derivatives.</dc:description>

Motivated by the appearance of an intense low-energy electronic transition, we especially analysed the effect of homoconjugation on the electronic structure and charge delocalization in the dicationic redox state of the triptycene derivatives. Then, several trinuclear high-spin cobalt (and copper) complexes were synthesized with the triphenylene and triptycene ligands, and the magnetic coupling and redox properties analysed. By choice of the coligands (hexafluoroacetylacetonate, trifluoroacetylacetonate and acetylacetonate), oxidation could be switched between metal- and ligand-centered redox events, leading to drastic changes in the magnetic or optical properties, especially as a consequence of homoconjugation in the triptycene derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Hierarchical CdS/NiS Photocatalysts Using Ni&#8722;MOF&#8208;74 as Template for Efficient Ethanol Conversion and Hydrogen Production under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 56, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni&#8722;MOF&#8208;74 was added to fabricate the hierarchical CdS/NiS&#8722;N composites with an elevated specific surface area during the hydrothermal synthesis of CdS microsphere, and the Ni&#8722;MOF&#8208;74 facilitate the self&#8208;assemble growth of CdS and provide a source of Ni for the formation of NiS. The prepared photocatalyst can efficiently convert ethanol while producing a large amount of hydrogen gas and exhibits excellent photocatalytic stability.







Abstract
The conversion of ethanol into high&#8208;valuable chemicals and H2 by photocatalytic process provides a sustainable approach to produce carbon&#8208;chain&#8208;prolonged chemicals and hydrogen energy. In this article, Ni&#8722;MOF&#8208;74 was added to fabricate the hierarchical CdS/NiS&#8722;N composites with an elevated specific surface area during the hydrothermal synthesis of CdS microsphere, and the Ni&#8722;MOF&#8208;74 facilitate the self&#8208;assemble growth of CdS and provide a source of Ni for the formation of NiS. The as&#8208;prepared photocatalyst was subjected to photocatalytic ethanol conversion, and the hierarchical composite material CdS/NiS&#8722;N (100) formed by adding 100&#8197;mg of Ni&#8722;MOF&#8208;74 exhibits the highest photocatalytic activity and stability in an ethanol aqueous solution with a water content of 10&#8201;%. Under visible light irradiation, the conversion rate of ethanol reached 15.2&#8201;% at the photocatalytic reaction of 5&#8197;h. The selectivity of 2,3&#8208;butanediol(2,3&#8208;BDO) was 25&#8201;%, and the selectivity of acetaldehyde(AA) was 63&#8201;%. Through various characterizations, it has been proven that a large specific surface area and the coupling interface between CdS and NiS are key factors in improving photocatalytic performance. This work provides an effective strategy for constructing photocatalysts with coupled cocatalysts/semiconductors and large specific surface areas.

         <dc:description>
The new cyanido&#8208;sulfate anion, [SO3CN]&#8722;, is a complex of the Lewis base CN&#8722; and the Lewis acid SO3. The ion the a pseudo&#8208;halide analogon of the well&#8208;known fluorido&#8208; and chlorido&#8208;sulfates. Its formation is astonishing because the oxidation of the cyanide ion by SO3 seems to be favorable. For the successful preparation it seems to be benefitial that the synthesis can be carried out at room temperature.







Abstract
The reaction of the pyridine adduct of SO3 and tetra&#8208;n&#8208;butyl&#8208;ammonium cyanide, [N(nBu)4][CN] at room temperature leads to the unprecedented cyanido&#8208;sulfate anion [SO3CN]&#8722; stabilized in the salt [N(nBu)4][SO3CN]. The anion is a pseudo&#8208;halogen congener of the well&#8208;known fluoro&#8208; and chloro&#8208;sulfates. The new anion has been studied by vibrational spectroscopy and theoretical calculations.

         <title>Gas Permeation through Mechanically Resistant Self&#8208;Standing Membranes of a Neat Amorphous Organic Cage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 56, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stand up and be tested: Self&#8208;standing membranes of a neat organic cage are reported here. The cage membranes showed a remarkably good mechanical resistance, which made them suitable for gas&#8208;permeation tests. This study pointed the possibility of using a simple organic cage molecule to achieve a molecular material with features that are generally observed with polymeric membranes.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of a novel film&#8208;forming organic cage and of its smaller analogue are here described. While the small cage produced single crystals suitable for X&#8208;ray diffraction studies, the large one was isolated as a dense film. Due to its remarkable film&#8208;forming properties, this latter cage could be solution processed into transparent thin&#8208;layer films and mechanically stable dense self&#8208;standing membranes of controllable thickness. Thanks to these peculiar features, the membranes were also successfully tested for gas permeation, reporting a behavior similar to that found with stiff glassy polymers such as polymers of intrinsic microporosity or polyimides. Given the growing interest in the development of molecular&#8208;based membranes, for example for separation technologies and functional coatings, the properties of this organic cage were investigated by thorough analysis of their structural, thermal, mechanical and gas transport properties, and by detailed atomistic simulations.

         <title>Synergistic Promotion of Large&#8208;Current Water Splitting through Interfacial Engineering of Hierarchically Structured CoP&#8722;FeP Nanosheets with Rich P Vacancies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 56, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CoP&#8722;FeP heterostructure catalyst with abundant P vacancies (Vp&#8722;CoP&#8722;FeP/NF) on nickel foam is constructed through impregnation and phosphorization. It demonstrates excellent hydrogen evolution performance and has practical application prospects in high&#8208;current overall water splitting. The catalyst&#8216;s unique hierarchical nanosheet structure, plentiful P vacancies and synergistic effect of CoP and FeP accelerate HER kinetics, resulting in its superior performance.







Abstract
The development of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts with high performance under large current density is still a challenge. Introducing P vacancies in heterostructure is an appealing strategy to enhance HER kinetics. This study investigates a CoP&#8722;FeP heterostructure catalyst with abundant P vacancies (Vp&#8722;CoP&#8722;FeP/NF) on nickel foam (NF), which was prepared using dipping and phosphating treatment. The optimized Vp&#8722;CoP&#8722;FeP catalyst exerted prominent HER catalytic capability, requiring an ultra&#8208;low overpotential (58&#8197;mV @ 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and displaying robust durability (50&#8197;h @ 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in 1.0&#8197;M KOH solution. Furthermore, the catalyst demonstrated superior overall water splitting activity as cathode, demanding only cell voltage of 1.76&#8197;V at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, outperforming Pt/C/NF(&#8722;) || RuO2/NF(+). The catalyst&#8216;s outstanding performance can be attributed to the hierarchical structure of porous nanosheets, abundant P vacancies, and synergistic effect between CoP and FeP components, which promote water dissociation and H* adsorption and desorption, thereby synergically accelerating HER kinetics and enhancing HER activity. This study demonstrates the potential of HER catalysts with phosphorus&#8208;rich vacancies that can work under industrial&#8208;scale current density, highlighting the importance of developing durable and efficient catalysts for hydrogen production.

         <title>Spontaneous Decoration of Ultrasmall Pt Nanoparticles on Size&#8208;Separated MoS2 Nanosheets</title>

Size of liquid exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets plays a crucial role in determining nanoparticle decoration densities in the spontaneous reduction of chloroplatinic acid into ultrasmall Pt nanoparticles.







Abstract
Liquid exfoliation can be considered as a viable approach for the scalable production of 2D materials due to its various benefits, although the polydispersity in the obtained nanosheet size hinders their straightforward incorporation. Size&#8208;separation can help alleviate these concerns, however a correlation between nanosheet size and property needs to be established to bring about size&#8208;specific applicability. Herein, size&#8208;selected aqueous nanosheet dispersions have been obtained via centrifugation&#8208;based protocols, and their chemical activity in the spontaneous reduction of chloroplatinic acid is investigated. Growth of ultrasmall Pt nanoparticles was achieved on nanosheet surfaces without a need for reducing agents, and stark differences in the nanoparticle coverage were observed as a function of nanosheet size. Defects in the nanosheets were probed via Raman spectroscopy, and correlated to the observed size&#8208;activity. Additionally, the effect of reaction temperature during synthesis was investigated. The electrochemical activity of the ultrasmall Pt nanoparticle decorated MoS2 nanosheets was evaluated for the hydrogen evolution reaction, and enhancement in performance was observed with nanosheet size, and nanoparticle decoration density. These findings shine light on the significance of nanosheet size in controlling spontaneous reduction reactions, and provide a deeper insight to intrinsic properties of liquid exfoliated nanosheets.

A ferrocene&#8208;based tetradentate ligand featured with modular synthesis and rigid skeleton was reported. Its iron(II) complex facilitates asymmetric direct hydrogenation of ketones without the participation of extra strong&#8208;field ligand such as CO and isocyanide. Various chiral alcohols including the intermediate for montelukast could be prepared with satisfactory yields and enantioinduction.







Abstract
We herein reported the design and synthesis of a ferrocene&#8208;based tetradentate ligand that is featured with modular synthesis and rigid skeleton. Its iron(II) complex facilitates asymmetric direct hydrogenation of ketones without the participation of extra strong&#8208;field ligand such as CO and isocyanide. Hydride donor lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) converted non&#8208;reactive Fe(II) species to reactive Fe(II) hydride species. With this catalyst, various chiral alcohols including the intermediate for montelukast could be prepared with satisfactory yields and enantioinduction.

Detection of Ba2+: Herein, we report on a highly Ba2+&#8208;selective, Ba2+&#8208;sensitive and pH independent fluorescent probe with a high photostability in water (cf. TOC). This fluorescent probe is equipped with a benzo&#8208;21&#8208;crown&#8208;7 as a highly selective Ba2+ ionophore and a tetramethylated BODIPY fluorophore.







Abstract
Herein, we report on highly Ba2+ selective fluorescence sensing in water by a fluorescent probe consisting of a benzo&#8208;21&#8208;crown&#8208;7 as a Ba2+ binding unit (ionophore) and a tetramethylated BODIPY fluorophore as a fluorescence reporter. This fluorescent probe showed a Ba2+ induced fluorescence enhancement (FE) by a factor of 12&#177;1 independently of the pH value and a high Ba2+ sensitivity with a limit of detection (LOD) of (17.2&#177;0.3)&#8197;&#956;M. Moreover, a second fluorescent probe consisting of the same BODIPY fluorophore, but a benzo&#8208;18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 as a cation&#8208;responsive binding moiety, showed an even higher FE upon Ba2+ complexation by a factor of 85&#177;3 and a lower LOD of (13&#177;3)&#8197;&#956;M albeit a lower Ba2+ selectivity. The fluorescence sensing mechanism of Ba2+ was further investigated by time&#8208;resolved fluorescence as well as transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) and it turned out that within these probes a blocking of a photoinduced electron transfer (PET) by Ba2+ is very likely responsible for the FE.

         <title>Direct Amination of Benzene with Ammonia by Flow Plasma Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 56, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct amination of benzene is demonstrated with a plasma microreactor. Using ammonia plasma, this process was optimized by studying the influence of temperature, residence time and power of the plasma. Various compounds were evaluated to study influence of double bond, conjugation, and aromaticity. Under optimized conditions, direct amination of benzene gave of total yield of 3.8&#8201;%.







Abstract
Amine derivatives, including aniline and allylic amines, can be formed in a single&#8208;step process from benzene and an ammonia plasma in a microreactor. Different process parameters such as temperature, residence time, and plasma power were evaluated to improve the reaction yield and its selectivity toward aminated products and avoid hydrogenated or oligomerized products. In parallel, simulation studies of the process have been carried out to propose a global mechanism and gain a better understanding of the influence of the different process parameters. The exploration of diverse related alkenes showed that the double bonds, conjugation, and aromatization influenced the amination mechanism. Benzene was the best reactant for amination based on the lifetime of radical intermediates. Under optimized conditions, benzene was aminated in the absence of catalyst with a yield of 3.8&#8201;% and a selectivity of 49&#8201;% in various amino compounds.

Two wide&#8208;band&#8208;capturing donor&#8208;acceptor conjugates featuring bis&#8208;styrylBODIPY and perylenediimide have been newly synthesized, and the occurrence of ultrafast excitation transfer from the singlet excited perylenediimide to BODIPY, and subsequent electron transfer from the excited BODIPY to PDI have been demonstrated.







Abstract
Two wide&#8208;band&#8208;capturing donor&#8208;acceptor conjugates featuring bis&#8208;styrylBODIPY and perylenediimide (PDI) have been newly synthesized, and the occurrence of ultrafast excitation transfer from the 1PDI* to BODIPY, and a subsequent electron transfer from the 1BODIPY* to PDI have been demonstrated. Optical absorption studies revealed panchromatic light capture but offered no evidence of ground&#8208;state interactions between the donor and acceptor entities. Steady&#8208;state fluorescence and excitation spectral recordings provided evidence of singlet&#8208;singlet energy transfer in these dyads, and quenched fluorescence of bis&#8208;styrylBODIPY emission in the dyads suggested additional photo&#8208;events. The facile oxidation of bis&#8208;styrylBODIPY and facile reduction of PDI, establishing their relative roles of electron donor and acceptor, were borne out by electrochemical studies. The electrostatic potential surfaces of the S1 and S2 states, derived from time&#8208;dependent DFT calculations, supported excited charge transfer in these dyads. Spectro&#8208;electrochemical studies on one&#8208;electron&#8208;oxidized and one&#8208;electron&#8208;reduced dyads and the monomeric precursor compounds were also performed in a thin&#8208;layer optical cell under corresponding applied potentials. From this study, both bis&#8208;styrylBODIPY&#8901;+ and PDI&#8901;&#8722; could be spectrally characterizes and were subsequently used in characterizing the electron&#8208;transfer products. Finally, pump&#8211;probe spectral studies were performed in dichlorobenzene under selective PDI and bis&#8208;styrylBODIPY excitation to secure energy and electron&#8208;transfer evidence. The measured rate constants for energy transfer, kENT, were in the range of 1011&#8197;s&#8722;1, while the electron transfer rate constants, kET, were in the range of 1010&#8197;s&#8722;1, thus highlighting their potential use in solar energy harvesting and optoelectronic applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two wide-band-capturing donor-acceptor conjugates featuring bis-styrylBODIPY and perylenediimide (PDI) have been newly synthesized, and the occurrence of ultrafast excitation transfer from the &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;PDI* to BODIPY, and a subsequent electron transfer from the &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;BODIPY* to PDI have been demonstrated. Optical absorption studies revealed panchromatic light capture but offered no evidence of ground-state interactions between the donor and acceptor entities. Steady-state fluorescence and excitation spectral recordings provided evidence of singlet-singlet energy transfer in these dyads, and quenched fluorescence of bis-styrylBODIPY emission in the dyads suggested additional photo-events. The facile oxidation of bis-styrylBODIPY and facile reduction of PDI, establishing their relative roles of electron donor and acceptor, were borne out by electrochemical studies. The electrostatic potential surfaces of the S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; states, derived from time-dependent DFT calculations, supported excited charge transfer in these dyads. Spectro-electrochemical studies on one-electron-oxidized and one-electron-reduced dyads and the monomeric precursor compounds were also performed in a thin-layer optical cell under corresponding applied potentials. From this study, both bis-styrylBODIPY&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;+&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; and PDI&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; could be spectrally characterizes and were subsequently used in characterizing the electron-transfer products. Finally, pump&#8211;probe spectral studies were performed in dichlorobenzene under selective PDI and bis-styrylBODIPY excitation to secure energy and electron-transfer evidence. The measured rate constants for energy transfer, &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ENT&lt;/sub&gt;, were in the range of 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, while the electron transfer rate constants, &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ET&lt;/sub&gt;, were in the range of 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, thus highlighting their potential use in solar energy harvesting and optoelectronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Rapid Synthesis of Colibactin Warhead Model Compounds Using New Metal&#8208;Free Photocatalytic Cyclopropanation Reactions Facilitates the Investigation of Biological Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 56, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new metal&#8208;free photocatalytic cyclopropanations employing eosin in the green solvent ethanol have been developed and then applied to the synthesis of colibactin warhead models. Using the models, we show what features can lead to nucleophilic addition at the cyclopropyl unit and which ones favor a ring expansion&#8208;addition sequence. We also show that copper could be responsible for catalyzing the known oxidation of the colibactin&#8208;DNA adduct.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of a series of colibactin warhead model compounds using two newly developed metal&#8208;free photocatalytic cyclopropanation reactions. These mild cyclopropanations expand the known applications of eosin within synthesis. A halogen atom transfer reaction mode has been harnessed so that dihalides can be used as the cyclopropanating agents. The colibactin warhead models were then used to provide new insight into two key mechanisms in colibactin chemistry. An explanation is provided for why the colibactin warhead sometimes undergoes a ring expansion&#8208;addition reaction to give fused cyclobutyl products while at other times nucleophiles add directly to the cyclopropyl unit (as when DNA adds to colibactin). Finally, we provide some evidence that Cu(II) chelated to colibactin may catalyze an important oxidation of the colibactin&#8208;DNA adduct. The Cu(I) generated as a result could then also play a role in inducing double strand breaks in DNA.

Undescribed aminosulfinates enabled the preparation of &#946;&#8208;fluoroalkylamines in a photocatalyzed addition reaction of the corresponding aminodifluoroalkyl radicals to electron&#8208;deficient, electron&#8208;rich alkenes and vinylaryls or unactivated alkenes.







Abstract
The synthesis of undescribed &#946;&#8208;aminodifluoroethylsulfinates and their uses in the hydroaminodifluoroalkylation of alkenes is reported. This reaction is performed in the presence of a photocatalyst (4CzIPN, Ru complexes) and enables the direct incorporation of a &#946;&#8208;difluoroamine moiety into vinylic aryls, unactivated alkenes, and electron&#8208;rich, or &#8208;deficient alkenes. The mechanism was studied, and the formation of a gem&#8208;difluoromethyl radical was observed after the selective oxidation of the sulfinate function.

         <title>Rapid Unambiguous Structure Elucidation of Streptnatamide A, a New Cyclic Peptide Isolated from A Marine&#8208;derived Streptomyces sp</title>

An inspiring collaboration between pharmaceutical industry and academia enabled discovery, structure elucidation, and biosynthetic pathway analysis of streptnatamide A, a new cyclic peptide isolated from secondary metabolites of a marine invertebrate&#8208;associated Streptomyces sp. This study highlights the application of mass spectrometry tools that enables the rapid unambiguous structure elucidation of this complex molecule.







Abstract
Cyclic peptides have been excellent source of drug leads. With the advances in discovery platforms, the pharmaceutical industry has a growing interest in cyclic peptides and has pushed several into clinical trials. However, structural complexity of cyclic peptides brings extreme challenges for structure elucidation efforts. Isotopic fine structure analysis, Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and detailed tandem mass spectrometry rapidly provided peptide sequence for streptnatamide A, a cyclic peptide isolated from a marine&#8208;derived Streptomyces sp. Marfey's analysis determined the stereochemistry of all amino acids, enabling the unambiguous structure determination of this compound. A non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase biosynthetic gene cluster (stp) was tentatively identified and annotated for streptnatamide A based on the in silico analysis of whole genome sequencing data. These analytical tools will be powerful tools to overcome the challenges for cyclic peptide structure elucidation and accelerate the development of bioactive cyclic peptides.

         <dc:description>
A convenient three&#8208;component tetrafluoroethylation reaction of alkenes induced by visible light has been developed using 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethylsulfonyl chloride and quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones. This method provides a facile approach to introduce the HCF2CF2 group into organic molecules under mild conditions, enabling the late&#8208;stage modification of biologically active and drug molecules.







Abstract
1,1,2,2&#8208;Tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;containing compounds are valuable structures due to their unique physicochemical properties, which have increasing potential application in drug discovery. However, synthetic methods for preparing such compounds are rare. Herein, we report the first use of 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethanesulfonyl chloride to introduce the HCF2CF2 group into organic molecules via a three&#8208;component, radical tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;heteroarylation of alkenes with readily available quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones. This method provides a new and facile approach for late&#8208;stage functionalization of potential biologically active molecules.

         <title>Induction and Stabilization of Columnar Mesophases in Fluorinated Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons by Arene&#8208;Perfluoroarene Interactions</title>

The efficient synthesis of fluorous polyaromatic hydrocarbons via the arene&#8208;fluorine nucleophilic substitution reaction offers a fast and clean synthetic route to highly &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems of interest for organic electronics. The development of long&#8208;range noncovalent arene&#8208;fluoroarene interactions enables the formation of broader and thermally more stable mesophases than their hydrogenated counterparts, as well as supramolecular luminescent gels and films.







Abstract
The straightforward synthesis of several Fluorinated Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons by the efficient, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, arene fluorine nucleophilic substitution reaction is described, and the full investigation of their liquid crystalline and optical properties reported. The key precursors for this study, i.&#8201;e. 2,2&#8217;&#8208;dilithio&#8208;4,4&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetraalkoxy&#8208;1,1&#8217;&#8208;biphenyl derivatives, were obtained in two steps from the highly selective Scholl oxidative homo&#8208;coupling of 3,4&#8208;dialkoxy&#8208;1&#8208;bromobenzene, followed by quantitative double&#8208;lithiation. In situ room temperature nucleophilic annulation with either perfluorobenzene or perfluoronaphthalene leads to 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;6,7,10,11&#8208;tetraalkxoytriphenylenes and 9,10,11,12,13,14&#8208;hexafluoro&#8208;2,3,6,7&#8208;tetraalkoxybenzo[f]tetraphenes, respectively, in good yields. Exploiting the same strategy, subsequent double annulations resulted in the formation of 9,18&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2,3,6,7,11,12,15,16&#8208;octa(alkoxy)tribenzo[f,k,m]tetraphenes and 9,10,19,20&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;2,3,6,7,12,13,16,17&#8208;octakis(hexyloxy)tetrabenzo[a,c,j,l]tetracenes, respectively. Despite the presence of only four alkoxy chains, the polar &#8220;Janus&#8221; mesogens display a columnar hexagonal mesophase over broad temperature ranges, with higher mesophase stability than the archetypical 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexa(alkoxy)triphenylenes and their hydrogenated counterparts. The improvement or induction of mesomorphism is attributed to efficient antiparallel face&#8208;to&#8208;face &#960;&#8208;stacking driven by the establishment of non&#8208;covalent perfluoroarene&#8208;arene intermolecular interactions. The larger lipophilic discotic &#960;&#8208;extended compounds also exhibit columnar mesomorphism, over similar temperature ranges and stability than their hydrogenated homologs. Finally, these fluorinated molecules form stringy gels in various solvents, and show interesting solvatochromic emission properties in solution as well as strong emission in thin films and gels.

         <title>Three Oxidative Addition Routes of Alkali Metal Aluminyls to Dihydridoaluminates and Reactivity with CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 56, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three distinct methods have been studied to convert alkali metal aluminyls, AM[Al(NONDipp)] (AM=Li&#8722;Cs) to dihydridoaluminates AM[Al(NONDipp)(H)2], which in turn reduce CO2 to bis&#8208;formates AM[Al(NONDipp)(O2CH)2]. Diverting from its usual proton&#8208;hydride releasing behaviour, 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene undergoes a remarkable oxidative addition in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometric reaction with Cs[Al(NONDipp)] yielding the inverse sandwich compound [{Cs(Et2O)}2{Al(NONDipp)(H)}2(C6H6)] (pictured).







Abstract
Three distinct routes are reported to the soluble, dihydridoaluminate compounds, AM[Al(NONDipp)(H)2] (AM=Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs; [NONDipp]2&#8722;=[O(SiMe2NDipp)2]2&#8722;; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) starting from the alkali metal aluminyls, AM[Al(NONDipp)]. Direct H2 hydrogenation of the heavier analogues (AM=Rb, Cs) produced the first examples of structurally characterized rubidium and caesium dihydridoaluminates, although harsh conditions were required for complete conversion. Using 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene (1,4&#8208;CHD) as an alternative hydrogen source in transfer hydrogenation reactions provided a lower energy pathway to the full series of products for AM=Li&#8722;Cs. A further moderation in conditions was noted for the thermal decomposition of the (silyl)(hydrido)aluminates, AM[Al(NONDipp)(H)(SiH2Ph)]. Probing the reaction of Cs[Al(NONDipp)] with 1,4&#8208;CHD provided access to a novel inverse sandwich complex, [{Cs(Et2O)}2{Al(NONDipp)(H)}2(C6H6)], containing the 1,4&#8208;dialuminated [C6H6]2&#8722; dianion and representing the first time that an intermediate in the commonly utilized oxidation process of 1,4&#8208;CHD to benzene has been trapped. The synthetic utility of the newly installed Al&#8722;H bonds has been demonstrated by their ability to reduce CO2 under mild conditions to form the bis&#8208;formate AM[Al(NONDipp)(O2CH)2] compounds, which exhibit a diverse series of eyecatching bimetallacyclic structures.

         <title>Inhibition of Amyloid &#946; Aggregation and Cytotoxicity by Berbamine Hydrochloride</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 56, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inhibitory effects of berbamine hydrochloride (BBMH) on A&#946; aggregation were comprehensively evaluated using several widely&#8208;used biophysical assays. Furthermore, the inhibitory mechanisms of BBMH were elucidated through SPR analysis and chemical kinetics analysis. These findings suggest that bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids hold great promise in the battle against Alzheimer's disease.







Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) continues to be a major global health challenge, and the recent approval of Aduhelm and Leqembi has opened new avenues for its treatment. Small&#8208;molecule inhibitors targeting A&#946; aggregation hold promise as an alternative to monoclonal antibodies. In this study, we evaluated the ability of berbamine hydrochloride (BBMH), a member of the bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids, to reduce A&#946; aggregation and cytotoxicity. Thioflavin T kinetics, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy results indicated that BBMH effectively inhibited A&#946; aggregation. Surface plasmon resonance and molecular docking results further revealed that BBMH could bind to A&#946; fibrils, thereby hindering the aggregation process. This physical picture has been confirmed in a quantitative way by chemical kinetics analysis, which showed BBMH tends to bind with the fibril ends and thus prevents the transition from protofibrils to mature fibrils as well as the elongation process. Additionally, our MTT results showed that BBMH was able to reduce the cytotoxicity of A&#946;40 on N2a cells. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, the potential of BBMH to inhibit A&#946; aggregation and cytotoxicity, offering a promising direction for further research and drug development efforts in the fight against Alzheimer's disease.

         <title>Revisiting sp2 Dilithio Methandiides: From Geometric Curiosity to Simple Bonding Description</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 56, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intriguing tetracoordinate geometry of a dilithio methandiide complex is probed from a coordination chemistry perspective, demonstrating the sp2&#8208;hybridized nature of the methandiide carbon and the other (non&#8208;covalent) interactions responsible for its planarity.







Abstract
The reported tetracoordinate dilithio methandiide complex from Liddle and co&#8208;workers (1) is investigated from a coordination chemistry perspective, to probe the origin of its intriguing geometry. Through the application of a variety of computational techniques, non&#8208;covalent (steric, electrostatic) interactions are found to be dominant. Further, we arrive at a bonding description which emphasizes the tricoordinate sp2&#8208;hybridized nature of the central methandiide carbon, differing somewhat from the original proposal. Thus, 1 is distinct from other dilithio methandiides since it contains only one C&#8722;Li &#963;&#8208;bond, and is found to be comparable to a simple aryllithium compound, phenyllithium.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The intriguing tetracoordinate geometry of a dilithio methandiide complex&lt;/b&gt; is probed from a coordination chemistry perspective, demonstrating the &lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;-hybridized nature of the methandiide carbon and the other (non-covalent) interactions responsible for its planarity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reported tetracoordinate dilithio methandiide complex from Liddle and co-workers (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) is investigated from a coordination chemistry perspective, to probe the origin of its intriguing geometry. Through the application of a variety of computational techniques, non-covalent (steric, electrostatic) interactions are found to be dominant. Further, we arrive at a bonding description which emphasizes the tricoordinate &lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;-hybridized nature of the central methandiide carbon, differing somewhat from the original proposal. Thus, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; is distinct from other dilithio methandiides since it contains only one C&#8722;Li &#963;-bond, and is found to be comparable to a simple aryllithium compound, phenyllithium.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Gold&#8208;Zinc Cooperative Catalysis for Seven&#8208;exo&#8208;dig Hydrocarboxylation of Internal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 56, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Seven&#8208;exo&#8208;dig hydrocarboxylation of internal alkynes was developed with gold&#8208;zinc bimetallic catalysts activating alkyne&#8208;tethered carboxylic acids via cooperative action of the gold and zinc sites. N&#8208;Substituents of the NHC ligand for gold complexes significantly affected their catalytic activities, in which a gold complex with a 2,6&#8208;dibenzhydryl&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenyl substituent served as the most effective catalyst for the seven&#8208;membered ring formation.







Abstract
Seven&#8208;exo&#8208;dig hydrocarboxylation of nonactivated internal alkynes with conformationally flexible linker chains was achieved with cooperative gold&#8208;zinc catalysts composed of an imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridinylidene ligand including a bipyridine coordination site at the C5 position. A proximity effect of the gold and zinc sites was essential for their high catalytic activity, in which the internal alkyne activated by the cationic gold species was attacked by the carboxylic acid deprotonated by the basic zinc site. Using a gold(I)&#8208;complex with a bulky aromatic N&#8208;substituent, 2,6&#8208;dibenzhydryl&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenyl group, for the NHC ligand facilitated seven&#8208;membered ring formation while minimizing intermolecular hydrocarboxylation as an undesired side reaction. The reaction mechanism was investigated by quantum chemical calculations.

         <title>Highly Efficient Luminescence from a Red Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter with Flexible Conformation of Ancillary Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 56, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The freer it goes, the brighter it shines. Rigid structure usually shows a positive effect on the efficiency of TADF emitters. In this work, Ph&#8208;TPA with flexible conformation of ancillary groups exhibited higher efficiency than Mc&#8208;TPA with conformationally locked ancillary groups. The macrocycle in MC&#8208;TPA made a significant contribution to the reorganization energy, leading to a severe non&#8208;radiative decay.







Abstract
Robust scaffolds were typically applied in thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules to suppress the non&#8208;radiative decay, trigger the fast spin&#8208;flipping, and enhance the light out&#8208;coupling efficiency. Herein, we disclosed for the first time the positive effect of flexible conformation of ancillary groups on the photophysical properties of TADF emitter. The red TADF emitter Ph&#8208;TPA with flexible conformation demonstrated small excited&#8208;state structural distortion and low reorganization energy compared to the counterpart Mc&#8208;TPA with a rigid macrocycle. Consequently, Ph&#8208;TPA showed an excellent photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY) of 92&#8201;% and a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 30.6&#8201;% at 630&#8197;nm. This work could deepen our understanding of structure&#8208;property relationships of organic luminophores and help us to rationalize the design of efficient TADF materials.

         <title>Formation of a Hexaphosphido Cobalt Complex through P&#8722;P Condensation</title>

[4+2] condensation reaction of diphosphene [(ClImDipp)P2(Dipp)]OTf and diphosphanide [(ClImDipp)P2(Dipp)Cl] with the cyclo&#8208;P4 cobalt complex [K(18c&#8208;6)][(PHDI)Co(&#951;4&#8208;cyclo&#8208;P4)] forms a CoP6 complex, featuring an unusual hexaphosphido ligand composed of a cyclo&#8208;P5 ring and an exocyclic (ClImDipp)P moiety. 31P&#8197;NMR spectroscopic studies reveal that at ambient temperature, this CoP6 complex undergoes disproportionation into more stable CoP7 and CoP5 complexes.







Abstract
The reaction between diphosphorus derivatives [(ClImDipp)P2(Dipp)]OTf (1[OTf]) and [(ClImDipp)P2(Dipp)Cl] (1[Cl]) with the cyclotetraphosphido cobalt complex [K(18c&#8208;6)][(PHDI)Co(&#951;4&#8208;cyclo&#8208;P4)] (2) leads to the formation of complex [(PHDI)Co{&#951;4&#8208;cyclo&#8208;P6(Dipp)(ClImDipp)}] (3), which features an unusual hexaphosphido ligand [ClImDipp=4,5&#8208;dichloro&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl, Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl, 18c&#8208;6=18&#8208;crown&#8208;6, PHDI=bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)phenanthrene&#8208;9,10&#8208;diimine]. Complex 3 was obtained as a crystalline material with a moderate yield at low temperature. Upon exposure to ambient temperature, compound 3 slowly transforms into two other compounds, [K(18c&#8208;6)][(PHDI)Co(&#951;4&#8208;P7Dipp)] (4) and [(PHDI)Co{cyclo&#8208;P5(ClImDipp)}] (5). The novel complexes 3&#8211;5 were characterized using multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. To shed light on the formation of these compounds, a proposed mechanism based on 31P&#8197;NMR monitoring studies is presented.

         <title>Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis of PROTACs and SNIPERs on Backbone Amide Linked (BAL) Resin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 56, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;phase approaches could offer many advantages over conventional PROTAC synthesis if the same chemistries and topographic diversity can be incorporated. We have examined solid&#8208;phase synthesis of both VHL&#8208;targeting PROTACS and IAP&#8208;targeting SNIPERS using backbone&#8208;amide linked (BAL resin) completing 8&#8211;11 step syntheses with products obtained with a single purification step.







Abstract
Developing straightforward but flexible approaches to PROTAC synthesis that can incorporate the structural elements of emerging designs can improve the quality and efficiency of PROTAC development. Solid&#8208;phase approaches could offer many advantages over conventional PROTAC synthesis if diverse chemistries and topographies can be incorporated.

     alt="Solid-Phase Synthesis of PROTACs and SNIPERs on Backbone Amide Linked (BAL) Resin"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Solid-phase approaches&lt;/b&gt; could offer many advantages over conventional PROTAC synthesis if the same chemistries and topographic diversity can be incorporated. We have examined solid-phase synthesis of both VHL-targeting PROTACS and IAP-targeting SNIPERS using backbone-amide linked (BAL resin) completing 8&#8211;11 step syntheses with products obtained with a single purification step.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing straightforward but flexible approaches to PROTAC synthesis that can incorporate the structural elements of emerging designs can improve the quality and efficiency of PROTAC development. Solid-phase approaches could offer many advantages over conventional PROTAC synthesis if diverse chemistries and topographies can be incorporated. We have exploited the backbone-amide-linked (BAL) resin to employ an array of solid-phase organic reactions, providing access to VHL- and IAP-targeting degraders using the BRD4-targeting JQ1 conjugates as examples.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Emissive Click Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 56, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Click reaction has been used to make covalent organic cages with tetraphenyl ethylene and tetrabiphenyl ethylene AIEgens. The emissive cages exhibit enhanced aggregation induced emission and detect picric acid in nanomolar quantity in aqueous solutions.







Abstract
This study reports the synthesis of cofacial organic cage molecules containing aggregation&#8208;induced emissive (AIE) luminogens (AIEgens) through four&#8208;fold Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) &#8220;click&#8221; reactions. The shorter AIEgen, tetraphenylethylene (TPE), afforded two orientational isomers (TPE&#8208;CC&#8208;1A and TPE&#8208;CC&#8208;1B). The longer AIEgen, tetrabiphenylethylene (TBPE), afforded a single isomer (TBPE&#8208;CC&#8208;2). The click reaction employed is irreversible, yet it yielded remarkable four&#8208;fold click products above 40&#8201;%. The phenyl rings around the ethylene core generate propeller&#8208;shaped chirality owing to their orientation, which influences the chirality of the resulting cages. The shorter cages are a mixture of PP/MM isomers, while the longer ones are a mixture of PM/MP isomers, as evidenced by their x&#8208;ray structures. The newly synthesized cage molecules are emissive even in dilute solutions (THF) and exhibit enhanced AIE upon the addition of water. The aggregated cage molecules in aqueous solution exhibit turn&#8208;off emission sensing of nitroaromatic explosives, with selectivity to picric acid in the 25&#8211;38 nanomolar detection range.

         <title>Multiple Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Catalysts Enhance the Asymmetric Cyanation of Ketimines and Aldimines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 56, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective cyanation of imines (up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8201;ee) has been developed using well&#8208;designed C2&#8208;symmetric hydrogen bonding catalysts. This catalytic system is distinguished by its low catalyst loading (S/C up to 1000), high efficiency, extremely broad substrate scope, scalability and mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
A highly enantioselective cyanation of imines (up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8201;ee) has been developed using well&#8208;designed C2&#8208;symmetric hydrogen bonding catalysts. The catalytic strategy was characterized with low catalyst loading (0.1&#8211;1&#8197;mol&#8201;%), easily accessible catalysts with diverse functional groups, and catalytic base additives. A wide range of imines, including the challenging N&#8208;Boc and N&#8208;Cbz protected ketimines and aldimines, as well as fluoroalkylated ketimines, were investigated under mild conditions to afford the products with good to excellent yields (up to 99&#8201;% yield) and high enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8201;ee). Control experiments revealed that the multiple hydrogen bonding catalysts enhanced the reactivity and enantioselectivity of the Strecker reaction initiated by the base.

Sulfur trioxide acts as a strong oxidizer towards halides as well as pseudohalides. Therefore, reactions of sulfur trioxide with cyanide anions do usually not lead to the formation of cyanido&#8208;sulfates anion but to oxidation of the cyanide ion. This problem can be avoided if a sulfur trioxide&#8208;pyridine complex is used instead of neat sulfur trioxide. In this way, the oxidation power is sufficiently reduced, and the pyridine molecule can be replaced by the cyanide anion under formation of the cyanido&#8208;sulfate anion, SO3CN&#8722;. Thus sulfur trioxide gets rid of the badly smelling pyridine molecule, however, at the expense of gaining the toxic cyanide anion. More information can be found in the Research Article by M.&#8197;S. Wickleder and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301761).

         <dc:description>
Gas separation: A novel organic cage with excellent film&#8208;forming tendencies was processed into transparent, mechanically robust, self&#8208;standing membranes of controllable thickness. Thanks to their peculiar features, the membranes of the neat cage were successfully tested for gas permeation (e.g., with CO2), with behavior similar to that found with stiff glassy polymers such as polymers of intrinsic microporosity or polyimides being reported.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gas separation&lt;/b&gt;: A novel organic cage with excellent film-forming tendencies was processed into transparent, mechanically robust, self-standing membranes of controllable thickness. Thanks to their peculiar features, the membranes of the neat cage were successfully tested for gas permeation (e.g., with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), with behavior similar to that found with stiff glassy polymers such as polymers of intrinsic microporosity or polyimides being reported.

Wide&#8208;band&#8208;capturing artificial photosynthetic model compounds featuring bisstyrylBODIPY and perylene diimide have been newly synthesized to probe excited&#8208;state energy and electron transfer. Excited&#8208;state DFT and free&#8208;energy calculations supported the occurrence of such photo events. Pump&#8211;probe spectroscopy provided the ultimate evidence wherein the measured rate constants for energy transfer were in the range of 1011&#8197;s&#8722;1, while the electron transfer rate constants were in the range of 10&#8197;s&#8722;1, thus highlighting their potential use in solar energy harvesting.

         <title>Critical Issues of Vanadium&#8208;Based Cathodes Towards Practical Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 56, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review aims to provide an overview of the key obstacles encountered by vanadium&#8208;based cathodes toward practical aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries, encompassing dissolution, by&#8208;product formation, and limited ion diffusion. Additionally, it highlights the latest advancements made in tackling these challenges and proposes potential directions for future research in this domain.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are gaining significant attention for their numerous advantages, including high safety, high energy density, affordability, and environmental friendliness. However, the development of ZIBs has been hampered by the lack of suitable cathode materials that can store Zn2+ with high capacity and reversibility. Currently, vanadium&#8208;based materials with tunnel or layered structures are widely researched owing to their high theoretical capacity and diversified structures. However, their long&#8208;term cycling stability is unsatisfactory because of material dissolution, phase transformation, and restrictive kinetics in aqueous electrolytes, which limits their practical applications. Different from previous reviews on ZIBs, this review specifically addresses the critical issues faced by vanadium&#8208;based cathodes for practical aqueous ZIBs and proposes potential solutions. Focusing on vanadium&#8208;based cathodes, their ion storage mechanisms, the critical parameters affecting their performance, and the progress made in addressing the aforementioned problems are also summarized. Finally, future directions for the development of practical aqueous ZIB are suggested.

         <title>Hydroelementation and Phosphinidene Transfer: Reactivity of Phosphagermenes and Phosphastannenes Towards Small Molecule Substrates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of [(Me3Si)2CH]2E=PMes* (E=Ge, Sn) from the reaction of the tetrylenes with a phospha&#8208;Wittig reagent is described. Reactivity studies reveal that they are capable of undergoing hydroelementation reactions across the E=P bond and of acting as masked phosphinidene sources.







Abstract
We describe the facile synthesis of [(Me3Si)2CH]2E=PMes* (E=Ge, Sn) from the reaction of the tetrylenes with the phospha&#8208;Wittig reagent, Me3P&#8722;PMes*. Their reactivity towards a range of substrates with protic and hydridic E&#8722;H bonds (E=N, O, Si) is described. In addition to hydroelementation reactions of the E=P bonds, we show that these compounds, particularly [(Me3Si)2CH]2Sn=PMes*, also act as base&#8208;stabilized phosphinidenes, allowing phosphinidene transfer to other nucleophiles.

         <title>Stable Dication Diradicals of Triply Fused Metallo Chlorin&#8208;Porphyrin Heterodimers: Impact of the Bridge on the Control of Spin Coupling to Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two highly stable, novel, triply fused dinickel(II)/dicopper(II) chlorin&#8208;porphyrin dication diradical heterodimers are reported in which the bridge is completely fused between two porphyrin macrocycles. UV&#8208;vis, EPR, and ESI&#8208;MS investigations enabled us to identify some of the key reactive intermediates disclosing tentative mechanistic details of such an unusual transformation.







Abstract
We report an unexpected rearrangement, controlled by the nature of the bridge, leading to the formation of novel, remarkably stable triply fused dinickel(II)/dicopper(II) chlorin&#8208;porphyrin dication diradical heterodimers in excellent yields. Here, a dipyrromethene bridge gets completely fused between two porphyrin macrocycles with two new C&#8722;C and one C&#8722;N bonds. The two macrocycles exhibit extensive &#960;&#8208;conjugation through the bridge, which results in an antiferromagnetic coupling between the two &#960;&#8208;cation radicals. In addition, the macrocyclic distortion also favours a rare intramolecular ferromagnetic interaction between the CuII and &#960;&#8208;cation radical spins to form a triplet state. The structural and electronic perturbation in the unconjugated dication diradical possibly enables the bridging pyrrolic nitrogen to undergo a nucleophilic attack at the nearby &#946;&#8208;carbon of the porphyrin &#960;&#8208;cation radical with a computed free energy barrier of &gt;20&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 which was supplied in the form of reflux condition to initiate such a rearrangement process. UV&#8208;vis, EPR and ESI&#8208;MS spectroscopies were used to monitor the rearrangement process in&#8197;situ in order to identify the key reactive intermediates leading to such an unusual transformation.

         <title>Carbon Nitrides from Supramolecular Crystals: From Single Atoms to Heterojunctions and Advanced Photoelectrodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular single crystals based on C&#8722;N monomers are used to prepared carbon nitride materials with tailored morphology and porosity, single atom catalysts or heterojunctions. This approach can be applied to fabricate efficient water splitting photoelectrodes.







Abstract
Carbon nitride materials (CN) have become one of the most studied photocatalysts within the last 15&#8197;years. While CN absorbs visible light, its low porosity and fast electron&#8208;hole recombination hinder its photoelectric performance and have motivated the research in the modification of its physical and chemical properties (such as energy band structure, porosity, or chemical composition) by different means. In this Concept we review the utilization of supramolecular crystals as CN precursors to tailor its properties. We elaborate on the features needed in a supramolecular crystal to serve as CN precursor, we delve on the influence of metal&#8208;free crystals in the morphology and porosity of the resulting materials and then discuss the formation of single atoms and heterojunctions when employing a metal&#8208;organic crystal. We finally discuss the performance of CN photoanodes derived from crystals and highlight the current standing challenges in the field.

         <title>Intramolecular Through&#8208;Space Double&#8208;Electron Transfer Between A Pair of Redox&#8208;Active Guanidine Units Aligned by Dithiolate Bridges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transfer in pairs: Intramolecular through&#8208;space electron transfer between an oxidized, dicationic and a reduced, neutral triguanidine unit is observed if the two units are preorientated by a dithiolate bridge.







Abstract
Using unconventional synthesis protocols, two redox&#8208;active triguanidine units are connected by a dithiolate bridge, aligning the two redox&#8208;active units in close proximity. The reduced, neutral and the tetracationic redox states with two dicationic triguanidine units are isolated and fully characterized. Then, the dicationic redox states are prepared by mixing the neutral and tetracationic molecules. At low temperatures, the dications are diamagnetic (singlet ground state) with two different triguanidine units (neutral and dicationic). At room temperature, the triplet state with two radical monocationic triguanidine units is populated. At low temperature (210&#8197;K), chemical exchange by intramolecular through&#8208;space electron&#8208;transfer between the two triguanidine units is evidenced by EXSY NMR spectroscopy. Intramolecular through&#8208;space transfer of two electrons from the neutral to the dicationic triguanidine unit is accompanied by migration of the counterions in opposite direction. The rate of double&#8208;electron transfer critically depends on the bridge. No electron&#8208;transfer is measured in the absence of a bridge (in a mixture of one dicationic and one neutral triguanidine), and relatively slow electron transfer if the bridge does not allow the two triguanidine units to approach each other close enough. The results give detailed, quantitative insight into the factors that influence intramolecular through&#8208;space double&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer processes.

         <title>Yttrium Complexes with Group 13 Heterobenzene&#8208;Type Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The gallabenzene&#8208;type yttrium complex [(1&#8208;Me&#8208;3,5&#8208;tBu2&#8722;C5H3Ga)(&#956;&#8208;Me)Y(2,4&#8208;dtbp)] (A) is readily formed from one&#8208;pot&#8208;reactions using mixtures [YMe3]n/GaMe3/K(2,4&#8208;dtbp) (2,4&#8208;dtbp=2,4&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;pentadienyl), while the remaining pentadienyl ligand gets easily displaced by pentamethylcyclopentadienyl affording B, showcasing the strong interaction of the heterobenzene ligand with the rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal center. Distinct ligand bonding is revealed by 89Y&#8197;NMR chemical shifts.







Abstract
The yttrium gallabenzene complex [(1&#8208;Me&#8208;3,5&#8208;tBu2&#8722;C5H3Ga)(&#956;&#8208;Me)Y(2,4&#8208;dtbp)] is accessible from Y(GaMe4)3 and K(2,4&#8208;dtbp) via a tandem salt metathesis/methane elimination (2,4&#8208;dtbp=2,4&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;pentadienyl). The pentadienyl ligand in [(1&#8208;Me&#8208;3,5&#8208;tBu2&#8722;C5H3E)(&#956;&#8208;Me)Y(2,4&#8208;dtbp)] (E=Al, Ga) is easily displaced by salt metathesis with KC5Me5 and KTpMe,Me (TpMe,Me=tris(pyrazolyl&#8208;Me2&#8208;3,5)borato) affording [(1&#8208;Me&#8208;3,5&#8208;tBu2&#8722;C5H3E)(&#956;&#8208;Me)Y(TpMe,Me)] and [(1&#8208;Me&#8208;3,5&#8208;tBu2&#8722;C5H3E)(&#956;&#8208;Me)Y(C5Me5)]. The yttrium center in [(1&#8208;Me&#8208;3,5&#8208;tBu2&#8722;C5H3E)(&#956;&#8208;Me)Y(2,4&#8208;dtbp)] readily forms adducts with neutral Lewis bases like 4&#8208;DMAP (4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine), PMe3, DMPE (1,2&#8208;bis(dimethylphosphino)ethane), and DME (1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane). In stark contrast, addition of TMEDA (N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetramethylethylenediamine) results in methyl/pentadienyl exchange between aluminum and yttrium resulting in [(1&#8208;(2,4&#8208;dtbp)&#8208;1&#8208;Me&#8208;3,5&#8208;tBu2&#8722;C5H3Al)Y(Me)(tmeda)]. The bonding features of the newly synthesized complexes are analyzed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) and heteronuclear (89Y, 31P) NMR spectroscopy.

The pentadienyl ligand in [(1-Me-3,5-&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;E)(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;-Me)Y(2,4-dtbp)] (E=Al, Ga) is easily displaced by salt metathesis with KC&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Me&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and KTp&lt;sup&gt;Me,Me&lt;/sup&gt; (Tp&lt;sup&gt;Me,Me&lt;/sup&gt;=tris(pyrazolyl-Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-3,5)borato) affording [(1-Me-3,5-&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;E)(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;-Me)Y(Tp&lt;sup&gt;Me,Me&lt;/sup&gt;)] and [(1-Me-3,5-&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;E)(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;-Me)Y(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Me&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)]. The yttrium center in [(1-Me-3,5-&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;E)(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;-Me)Y(2,4-dtbp)] readily forms adducts with neutral Lewis bases like 4-DMAP (4-dimethylaminopyridine), PMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, DMPE (1,2-bis(dimethylphosphino)ethane), and DME (1,2-dimethoxyethane). In stark contrast, addition of TMEDA (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&#8217;&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&#8217;&lt;/i&gt;-tetramethylethylenediamine) results in methyl/pentadienyl exchange between aluminum and yttrium resulting in [(1-(2,4-dtbp)-1-Me-3,5-&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al)Y(Me)(tmeda)]. The bonding features of the newly synthesized complexes are analyzed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) and heteronuclear (&lt;sup&gt;89&lt;/sup&gt;Y, &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P) NMR spectroscopy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solid&#8208;State [4+4] Cycloaddition and Cycloreversion with Use of Unpaired Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Donors to Achieve Solvatomorphism and Stabilization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solid&#8208;state [4+4] cycloaddition of a commercially available anthracene derivative affords facile synthesis of a cycloadduct. The cycloaddition is reversible in the solid&#8208;state using heat or mechanical force. The cycloadduct is highly solvatomorphic due to presence of unused, strong hydrogen&#8208;bond donors and is applied to the thermal stabilization of monomers.







Abstract
The crystal structure of a commercially available anthracene derivative, anthracene&#8208;9&#8208;thiocarboxamide, is reported here for the first time. The compound undergoes a [4+4] cycloaddition in the solid state to afford facile synthesis of the cycloadduct (CA). The cycloaddition is also reversible in the solid state using heat or mechanical force. Due to the presence of unpaired, strong hydrogen&#8208;bond donor atoms on the CA, significant solvatomorphism is achieved, and components of the solvatomorphs self&#8208;assemble into four different classes of supramolecular structures. The CA readily crystallizes with a variety of structurally&#8208;diverse solvents including those containing oxygen&#8208;, nitrogen&#8208;, or pi&#8208;acceptors. Some of the solvents the CA crystallized with include thiophene, benzene, and the three xylene isomers; thus, the CA was employed in industrially&#8208;relevant solvent separation. However, in competition studies, the CA did not exhibit selectivity. Lastly, it is demonstrated that the CA crystallizes with vinyl&#8208;containing monomers and is currently the only compound that crystallizes with both widely used monomers 4&#8208;vinylpyridine and styrene. Solid&#8208;state complexation of the CA with the monomers affords over a 50&#8201;&#176;C increase in the monomer's thermal stabilities. The strategy of designing molecules with unused donors can be applied to achieve separations or volatile liquid stabilization.

         <title>A Combination of B&#8208; and N&#8208;Doped &#960;&#8208;Systems Enabling Systematic Tuning of Electronic Structures and Properties</title>

B/N&#8208;codoped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were constructed via combining the B&#8208; and N&#8208;doped &#960;&#8208;systems. Two B/N&#8208;codoped PAHs were synthesized through the Mallory photoreaction, and their electronic structures and optical properties could be effectively modulated via static and dynamic control of intramolecular charge transfer states.







Abstract
Doping heteroatoms into polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) may alter their structures and thereby physical properties. This study reports the construction of B/N&#8208;codoped PAHs via combining the B&#8208; and N&#8208;doped &#960;&#8208;systems. Two &#960;&#8208;extended B/N&#8208;codoped PAHs were synthesized through the Mallory photoreaction. Both feature a C48BN2 &#960;&#8208;skeleton, which is assembled by linearly fusing three substructures including B&#8208;doped and sp2&#8208;hybridized N&#8208;doped &#960;&#8208;moieties and one pyrene unit. In comparison to the pristine B&#8208;doped analog, their intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) states are distinctly modulated by the fused N&#8208;doped &#960;&#8208;system and the further incorporated cyano group, leading to their tunable optical properties, as revealed by detailed theoretical and experimental analysis. Furthermore, these three molecules have sufficient Lewis acidity and can coordinate with Lewis base to form Lewis acid&#8208;base adducts, and notably, such intermolecular complexation can further dynamically modulate their ICT transitions and thereby photophysical properties, such as producing blue, green and red fluorescence.

         <title>Chemistry and Biology of Podophyllotoxins&#8722;An Update</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Podophyllotoxin is an aryltetralin lignan lactone derived from different plants of Podophyllum. It consists of five rings with four chiral centers, one trans&#8208;lactone and one aryl tetrahydronaphthalene skeleton with multiple modification sites. Moreover, podophyllotoxin and its derivatives showed lots of bioactivities, including anticancer, anti&#8208;inflammatory, antiviral, and insecticidal properties. The demand for podophyllotoxin and its derivatives is rising as a result of their high efficacy. As a continuation of our previous review (Chem. Eur. J., 2017, 23, 4467&#8208;4526), herein we summarized total synthesis, biotransformation, structural modifications, bioactivities, and structure&#8208;activity relationships of podophyllotoxin and its derivatives from 2017 to 2022. Meanwhile, we compiled an update information on the origin of new podophyllotoxin analogues from plants from 2014 to 2022. We hope that this review will provide a reference for future high value&#8211;added applications of podophyllotoxin and its analogues in the pharmaceutical and agricultural fields</dc:description>

         <title>Acceptorless or Transfer Dehydrogenation of Glycerol Catalyzed by Base Metal Salt Cobaltous Chloride &#8211; Facile Access to Lactic Acid and Hydrogen or Isopropanol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dehydrogenation of glycerol to lactic acid (LA) under both acceptorless and transfer dehydrogenation conditions using readily available, inexpensive, environmentally benign and earth&#8208;abundant base metal salt CoCl2 is reported here. The CoCl2 (0.5 mol%) catalyzed acceptorless dehydrogenation of glycerol at 160 &#176;C in the presence of 0.75 equiv of KOH, gave up to 33% yield of LA in 44% selectivity apart from hydrogen. Alternatively, with acetone as a sacrificial hydrogen acceptor, the CoCl2 (0.5 mol%) catalyzed dehydrogenation of glycerol at 160 &#176;C in the presence of 1.1 equiv of NaOtBu resulted in up to 93% LA with 96% selectivity along with another value&#8208;added product isopropanol. Labelling studies revealed a modest secondary KIE of 1.68 which points to the involvement of C&#8208;H bond activation as a part of the catalytic cycle but not as a part of the rate&#8208;determining step. Catalyst poisoning experiments with PPh3 and CS2 are indicative of the homogeneous nature of the reaction mixture involving&#160;molecular species that are likely to be in&#8208;situ formed octahedral Co(II) as inferred from EPR, HRMS and Evans magnetic moment studies. The net transfer dehydrogenation activity is attributed to exclusive contribution from the alcoholysis step.</dc:description>

Diradicals: Simple, modular and convergent access to diradicals with controllable S&#8722;T gap demonstrated with two examples.







Abstract
Reactions of a benzo[e][1,2,4]triazine with dilithiobenzenes lead to di&#8208;Blatter diradicals connected at the N(1) positions via a spin coupling unit, 1,4&#8208;phenylene or 1,3&#8208;phenylene. Electrochemical analysis in MeCN revealed four one&#8208;electron redox processes separated by 0.1&#8211;0.3&#8197;V in both diradicals. Variable temperature EPR measurements in polystyrene (PS) solid solutions gave the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps &#916;ES&#8208;T=2&#8197;J of &#8722;3.02(11) and &#8722;0.16(1)&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for 1,4&#8208;phenylene and 1,3&#8208;phenylene derivatives, respectively. The latter negative value was attributed to conformational properties of the diradical in the PS solid solution. Results suggest a simple and efficient access to a family of stable Blatter diradicals with a controllable S&#8722;T gap through a judicious choice of the arylene coupling unit. DFT calculations indicate that the triplet state is stabilized by (het)arylenes with low LUMO.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reactions of a benzo[&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;][1,2,4]triazine with dilithiobenzenes lead to di-Blatter diradicals connected at the N(1) positions via a spin coupling unit, 1,4-phenylene or 1,3-phenylene. Electrochemical analysis in MeCN revealed four one-electron redox processes separated by 0.1&#8211;0.3&#8197;V in both diradicals. Variable temperature EPR measurements in polystyrene (PS) solid solutions gave the singlet-triplet energy gaps &#916;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;

The latter negative value was attributed to conformational properties of the diradical in the PS solid solution.

The amorphous titanium dioxide is used to coat eGaSn nanodroplets (eGaSn NDs) to construct the core&#8208;shell structure of eGaSn@TiO2 nanodroplets (eGaSn@TiO2 NDs). The amorphous TiO2 shell forms a stable SEI film, alleviates volume expansion, and provides electron/ion transport channels. The resulting eGaSn@TiO2 NDs exhibit high capacities of 580, 540, 515, 485, 456 and 426&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5&#8197;C, respectively. No obvious decay is observed in more than 500&#8197;cycles with a capacity of 455&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;C.







Abstract
Gallium&#8208;based alloy liquid metal batteries currently face limitations such as volume expansion, unstable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film and substantial capacity decay. In this study, amorphous titanium dioxide is used to coat eutectic GaSn nanodroplets (eGaSn NDs) to construct the core&#8208;shell structure of eGaSn@TiO2 nanodroplets (eGaSn@TiO2 NDs). The amorphous TiO2 shell (~6.5&#8197;nm) formed a stable SEI film, alleviated the volume expansion, and provided electron/ion transport channels to achieve excellent cycling performance and high specific capacity. The resulting eGaSn@TiO2 NDs exhibited high capacities of 580, 540, 515, 485, 456 and 426&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5&#8197;C, respectively. No significant decay was observed after more than 500&#8197;cycles with a capacity of 455&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;C. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (in&#8197;situ XRD) was used to explore the lithiation mechanism of the eGaSn negative electrode during discharge. This study elucidates the design of advanced liquid alloy&#8208;based negative electrode materials for high&#8208;performance liquid metal batteries (LMBs).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In order to achieve a multifunctional compound with potential application in organic photonics and electronics, a multidonor benzothiadiazole derivative was rationally designed and synthesized employing microwave irradiation as energy source, increasing the process efficiency about yields and reaction times in comparison with conventional conditions. This powerful compound displayed solvatochromism and showed efficient behavior as red optical waveguide with low OLC around 10&#8208;2 dB &#956;m&#8208;1 and with the capacity of light transmission in two directions. In addition, the proposed derivative acted as efficient p&#8208;type semiconductor in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) with hole mobilities up 10&#8208;1 cm2V&#8208;1s&#8208;1. This corroborates its multifunctional character, thus making it a potential candidate to be applied in hybrid organic field&#8208;effect optical waveguides (OFEWs).</dc:description>

         <title>Bioinspired Functionalization of Carbonyl Compounds Enabled by Metal Chelated Bifunctional Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In Nature, enzymatic reactions proceed through exceptionally ordered transition states giving rise to extraordinary levels of stereoselection. In those reactions, the active site of the enzyme plays crucial roles &#8211; through one position, it holds the substrate in the proximity to the reaction epicentre that facilitates both the reactivity and stereoselectivity of the chemical process. Inspired by this natural phenomenon, synthetic chemists have designed bifunctional ligands that not only coordinate to a metal centre but also preassociate with an organic substrate, e.g. aldehyde and ketone, and exerts stereodirecting influence to accelerate the attack of the incoming reacting partner from a particular enantiotopic face. The chief goal of the current review is to give an overview of the recently developed approaches enabled by privileged bio&#8208;inspired bifunctional ligands that not only bind to the metal catalyst but also activates carbonyl substrates via organocatalysis, thereby easing in the new bond forming step. As carbonyl a&#8208;functionalizations are dominated by enamine and enolate chemistry, the current review primarily focusses on enamine&#8208; and enolate&#8208;metal catalysis by bifunctional ligands. Thus, developments based on traditional cooperative catalysis occurring through two directly coupled but independent catalytic cycles of an organocatalyst and a metal catalyst are not covered.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing the unique role of water in the formation of benzothiazoles: an experimental and computational study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present here a joint experimental and computational study on the formation of benzothiazoles. Our investigation reveals a green protocol for accessing benzothiazoles from acyl chlorides using either water alongside a reducing agent as the reaction medium or in combination with stoichiometric amounts of a weak acid, instead of the harsh conditions and catalysts previously reported. Specifically, we show that a protic solvent, particularly water, enables the formation of 2&#8208;substituted benzothiazoles from N&#8208;acyl 1,2&#8208;aminothiophenols already at room temperature, without the need for strong acids or metal catalysts. DFT Molecular Dynamics simulations coupled with advanced enhanced sampling techniques provide a clear understanding of the catalytic role of water. We demonstrate how bulk water &#8211; due to its extended network of hydrogen bonds and an efficient Grotthus mechanism &#8211; provides a reaction path that strongly reduces the reaction barriers compared to aprotic environments, namely more than 80 kJ/mol for the first reaction step and 250 kJ/mol for the second. Finally, we discuss the influence of different aliphatic and aromatic substituents with varying electronic properties on chemical reactivity. Besides providing in&#8208;depth mechanistic insights, we believe that our findings pave the way for a greener route toward an important class of bioactive molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Heteroditopic NHC Ligand Supported Manganese(I)&#8208;Complexes:&#160;Synthesis, Characterization, and Activity as Non&#8208;bifunctional&#160;Phosphine&#8208;Free Catalyst for the &#945;&#8209;Alkylation of Nitriles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the present work, several manganese(I) complexes of chelating heteroditopic ligands Mn1&#8208;3, featuring ImNHC (imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) connected to a 1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;N or tzNHC (1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;5&#8208;ylidene) donors via a methylene spacer, with possible modifications at the triazole backbone have been synthesized and completely characterized. Notably, the CO stretching frequencies, electrochemical analysis, and frontier orbital analysis certainly suggests that the chelating ImNHC&#8208;tzNHC ligands have stronger donation capabilities than the related ImNHC&#8208;Ntz ligand in the synthesized complexes. Moreover, these well&#8208;defined phosphine free Mn(I)&#8208;NHC complexes have been found to be effective non&#8208;bifunctional catalysts for the &#945;&#8208;alkylation of nitriles using alcohols and importantly, the catalyst Mn1 containing ImNHC connected to a weaker triazole&#8208;N donor displayed higher activity compared to Mn2/Mn3 containing an unsymmetrical bis&#8208;carbene donors (ImNHC and tzNHC).

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the present work, several manganese(I) complexes of chelating heteroditopic ligands Mn1-3, featuring ImNHC (imidazol-2-ylidene) connected to a 1,2,3-triazole-N or tzNHC (1,2,3-triazol-5-ylidene) donors via a methylene spacer, with possible modifications at the triazole backbone have been synthesized and completely characterized. Notably, the CO stretching frequencies, electrochemical analysis, and frontier orbital analysis certainly suggests that the chelating ImNHC-tzNHC ligands have stronger donation capabilities than the related ImNHC-Ntz ligand in the synthesized complexes. Moreover, these well-defined phosphine free Mn(I)-NHC complexes have been found to be effective non-bifunctional catalysts for the &#945;-alkylation of nitriles using alcohols and importantly, the catalyst Mn1 containing ImNHC connected to a weaker triazole-N donor displayed higher activity compared to Mn2/Mn3 containing an unsymmetrical bis-carbene donors (ImNHC and tzNHC). A wide range of aryl nitriles were coupled with diverse (hetero)aromatic as well as aliphatic alcohols to get the corresponding products in good to excellent yields (32 examples, up to 95% yield).

         <title>Isomeric effect of &#960; bridge in IDT&#8208;based nonfused electron photovoltaic acceptor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One pair of isomers, IDT&#8208;BOF containing S&#183;&#183;&#183;O/F&#183;&#183;&#183;H noncovalently configurational locks and IDT&#8208;BFO containing F&#183;&#183;&#183;H/O&#183;&#183;&#183;H noncovalently configurational locks, were designed and synthesized with an acceptor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) structure by choosing 4,9&#8208;dihydro&#8208;s&#8208;indaceno[1,2&#8208;b:5,6&#8208;b']dithiophene (IDT) as the D unit, F/n&#8208;hexyloxy substituted phenyl ring as &#960; bridge, and 3&#8208;(dicyanomethylidene)indan&#8208;1&#8208;one as the A unit. Owing to the S&#183;&#183;&#183;O/F&#183;&#183;&#183;H or F&#183;&#183;&#183;H/O&#183;&#183;&#183;H noncovalently configurational locks, both IDT&#8208;BOF and IDT&#8208;BFO show completely planar structure. In comparison to IDT&#8208;BFO, IDT&#8208;BOF exhibits similar LUMO but higher HOMO energy levels, leading to a smaller optical bandgap and red&#8208;shifted absorption. However, IDT&#8208;BOF&#8208;based bulk&#8208;heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ&#8208;OSCs) coupled with PBDB&#8208;T, and PCE&#8208;10 as donor materials both exhibited a lower PCE than that of IDT&#8208;BFO (PBDB&#8208;T: 5.2% vs. 6.1%; PCE&#8208;10: 1.7% vs. 3.2%). Comprehensively comparing and investigating IDT&#8208;BOF:PBDB&#8208;T and IDT&#8208;BFO:PBDB&#8208;T OSCs suggested that the large phase separation and serious charge recombination of IDT&#8208;BOF based OSCs contributed to its lower PCE. Importantly, ternary solar cells based on PBDB&#8208;T:Y5 as control devices by adding 10% IDT&#8208;BFO exhibited a 5% enhancement in the PCE compared to the control device (14.3% vs. 13.6%).</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling N2 to ammonia conversion in Bi2WO6&#8208;based materials: A new avenue in photocatalytic applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The field of photocatalysis has been evolving since 1972 since Honda and Fujishima&#8217;s initial push for using light as an energy source to accomplish redox reactions. Since then, many photocatalysts have been studied, semiconductors or otherwise. A new photocatalytic application to convert N2 gas to ammonia (N2 fixation or nitrogen reduction reaction; NRR) has emerged. Many researchers have steered their research in this direction due to developments in the ease of ammonia detection through UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy. This concept will specifically discuss Bi2WO6&#8208;based materials, techniques to enhance their photocatalytic activity (CO2 reduction, H2 production, pollutant removal, etc.), and their current application in photocatalytic NRR. Initially, a brief introduction of Bi2WO6 along with its VB and CB potentials will be compared to various redox potentials. A final topic of interest would be a brief description of photocatalytic nitrogen fixation with additional consideration to Bi2WO6&#8208;based materials in N2 fixation. A major problem with photocatalytic NRR is the false ammonia quantification in Bi&#8208;based materials, which will be discussed in detail and also ways to minimize them.</dc:description>

         <title>Control of substrate conformation by hydrogen bonding in a retaining &#946;&#8208;endoglycosidase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bacterial &#946;&#8208;glycosidases are hydrolytic enzymes that depolymerize polysaccharides such as &#946;&#8208;cellulose, &#946;&#8208;glucans and &#946;&#8208;xylans from different sources, which are used in a myriad of biomedical and industrial applications. It has been shown that a conformational change of the substrate, from a relaxed 4C1 conformation to a distorted 1S3/1,4B conformation of the reactive sugar, is necessary for catalysis. However, the molecular determinants that stabilize the substrate&#8217;s distortion are poorly understood. Here we use quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM)&#8208;based molecular dynamics methods to assess the impact of the interaction between the reactive sugar, i.e. the one at subsite &#8208;1, and the catalytic nucleophile (a glutamate) on substrate conformation. We show that the hydrogen bond involving the C2 exocyclic group and the nucleophile controls substrate conformation: its presence preserves sugar distortion, whereas its absence (e.g. in an enzyme mutant) knocks it out. We also show that 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2&#8208;fluoro derivatives, widely used to trap the reaction intermediates by X&#8208;ray crystallography, reproduce the conformation of the hydrolysable substrate at the experimental conditions. These results highlight the importance of the 2&#8208;OH&#183;&#183;&#183;nucleophile interaction in substrate recognition and catalysis in endo&#8208;glycosidases and can inform mutational campaigns aimed to search for more efficient enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron(II) Complexes of P3&#8208;chain Ligands: Structural diversity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iron(II) complexes containing ligands with a R2P&#8211;P&#8211;PR2 unit were synthesized by metathesis reactions. With R&#160;=&#160;tBu, a mixture of two isomers is formed; in one of them, the terminal phosphorus binds to the Fe center (ylidic structure), while in the other one, the central P atom is linked to Fe. Starting from differently functionalized parent triphosphanes and corresponding functionalized Fe complexes, the ratio of isomers does not change. The outcome of the reaction and therefore the binding modes of the triphosphane ligands in the resulting compounds can be influenced by the size of the substituents. In the case of R&#160;=&#160;iPr a chelate complex is formed (both terminal P atoms are linked to the Fe center). Applying the mixed&#8208;substituted triphosphane, the ylidic structure of the resulting complex is preferred. The new compounds were characterized by NMR spectroscopy in solution and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction in solid&#8208;state. The synthetic work was supported by DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Extremely Stable Perylene Bisimide&#8208;Bridged Regioisomeric Diradicals and Their Redox Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Excellent stability is an essential premise for organic diradicals to be used in organic electronic and spintronic devices. Herein, we attach two tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM) radical building blocks to the two sides of perylene bisimide (PBI) bridges and obtain two regioisomeric diradicals (1,6&#8208;TTM&#8208;PBI and 1,7&#8208;TTM&#8208;PBI). Both of the isomers show super stability rather than the monomeric TTM under ambient conditions, due to the enlarged conjugation as well as the electron withdrawing effects from the PBI bridges. The diradicals show distinct and reversible multi&#8208;step redox processes, and the spectroelectrochemistry investigation reveals the generation of organic mixed&#8208;valence (MV) species during reduction processes. The two diradicals have singlet ground states, very small singlet&#8722;triplet energy gaps (&#916;ES&#8208;T) and a pure open&#8208;shell character (with diradical character y0 = 0.966 for 1,6&#8208;TTM&#8208;PBI and 0.967 for 1,7&#8208;TTM&#8208;PBI). This work opens a window to develop very stable diradicals and offers them opportunity of further applications in optical, electronic and magnetic devices.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Excellent stability is an essential premise for organic diradicals to be used in organic electronic and spintronic devices. Herein, we attach two tris(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM) radical building blocks to the two sides of perylene bisimide (PBI) bridges and obtain two regioisomeric diradicals (1,6-TTM-PBI and 1,7-TTM-PBI). Both of the isomers show super stability rather than the monomeric TTM under ambient conditions, due to the enlarged conjugation as well as the electron withdrawing effects from the PBI bridges. The diradicals show distinct and reversible multi-step redox processes, and the spectroelectrochemistry investigation reveals the generation of organic mixed-valence (MV) species during reduction processes. The two diradicals have singlet ground states, very small singlet&#8722;triplet energy gaps (&#916;ES-T) and a pure open-shell character (with diradical character y0 = 0.966 for 1,6-TTM-PBI and 0.967 for 1,7-TTM-PBI). This work opens a window to develop very stable diradicals and offers them opportunity of further applications in optical, electronic and magnetic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Aryl&#8208;ether&#8208;linked Covalent Organic Framework Modified with Thioamide Groups for Selective Extraction of Palladium from Strong Acid Solutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient adsorption of palladium ions from acid nuclear waste solution is crucial for ensuring the safety of vitrification process for radioactive waste. However, the limited stability and selectivity of most current adsorbents hinder their practical applications under strong acid and intense radiation conditions. Herein, to address these limitations, we designed and synthesized an aryl&#8208;ether&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (COF&#8208;316&#8208;DM) grafted dimethylthiocarbamoyl groups on the pore walls. This unique structure endows COF&#8208;316&#8208;DM with high stability and exceptional palladium capture capacity. The robust polyarylether linkage enables COF&#8208;316&#8208;DM to withstand irradiation doses of 200 or 400 kGy of &#946;/&#947; ray. Furthermore, COF&#8208;316&#8208;DM demonstrates fast adsorption kinetics, high adsorption capacity (147 mg g&#8208;1), and excellent reusability in 4 M nitric acid. Moreover, COF&#8208;316&#8208;DM exhibits remarkable selectivity for palladium ions in the presence of 17 interference ions, simulating high level liquid waste scenario. The superior adsorption performance can be attributed to the strong binding affinity between the thioamide groups and Pd2+ ions, as confirmed by the comprehensive analysis of FT&#8208;IR and XPS spectra. Our findings highlight the potential of COFs with robust linkers and tailored functional groups for efficient and selective capture of metal ions, even in harsh environmental conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;free Propargylboration of Ketones with Allenyl&#8208;Bpins: Highly Stereoselective Synthesis of tert&#8208;Homopropargyl Alcohols Bearing Vicinal Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A practical and efficient propargylboration of ketones is presented using general allenylboronic acid pinacol esters (allenyl&#8208;Bpins) without a catalyst. This reaction is triggered by in&#8208;situ activation of stable allenyl&#8208;Bpins through the sequential addition of 1.25 equiv. of nBuLi and the prerequisite 2.0 equiv. of TFAA. Under the optimized reaction conditions, the versatile trisubstituted allenyl&#8208;Bpins react with various ketones smoothly to afford a wide range of tert&#8208;homopropargyl alcohols bearing vicinal stereocenters in high yields with good to excellent diastereoselectivities. Furthermore, propargylboration of ketones with chiral trisubstituted allenyl&#8208;Bpins allows for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral tert&#8208;homopropargyl alcohols with a full chirality transfer.</dc:description>

         <title>Diphenylpyrrole&#8208;Strapped Calix[4]pyrrole Extractant for the Fluoride and Chloride Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extractants: The diphenylpyrrole&#8208;strapped calix[4]pyrrole and its dual host systems involving crown ethers enable the extraction of various fluoride and chloride salts from water.







Abstract
The anion binding features of diphenylpyrrole&#8208;strapped calix[4]pyrrole 1 have been investigated by means of 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy and ITC (isothermal titration calorimetry), as well as single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. Receptor 1 bearing an auxiliary pyrrolic NH donor and solubilizing phenyl groups on the strap was found to bind F&#8722;, Cl&#8722;, and Br&#8722; as their tetrabutylammonium salts with high affinity in DMSO&#8208;d6. In addition, receptor 1 was found to extract the fluoride anion (as both its tetraethylammonium (TEA+) and tetrabutylammonium (TBA+) salts), as well as the chloride anion into chloroform&#8208;d from an aqueous source phase. Cation metathesis using TBAI or the use of a dual host approach involving crown ethers enabled receptor 1 to extract simple alkali metal fluoride or chloride salts from water. Quantitative binding of NaF by receptor 1 was observed in 20&#8201;% D2O&#8208;DMSO&#8208;d6 allowing for the direct determination of the NaF concentration in an unknown sample.

         <title>2D Non&#8208;van der Waals Nanoplatelets of Hematene and Magnetene: Nonlinear Optical Response and Optical Limiting Performance from UV to NIR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present study reports that non&#8208;van der Waals 2D materials, hematene and magnetene, show very efficient optical limiting (OL) from UV to visible, with their optical limiting onset (OLon) values exhibiting a decreasing trend towards UV irradiation wavelengths. The obtained results render these materials very promising candidates for OL&#8208;related applications, such as the protection of human retinal from high&#8208;power laser.







Abstract
Recently, the preparation of some hematene and magnetene ultrathin non van der Waals (non&#8208;vdW) 2D nanoplatelets was reported starting from hematite and magnetite natural iron ores. The present work reports on the determination and evaluation of the nonlinear optical response and the optical limiting (OL) action of these 2D nanoplatelets dispersed in water under ns laser excitation. The obtained results show that both hematene and magnetene exhibit strong nonlinear absorption and refraction, comparable and even larger than those of other van der Waals (vdW) 2D counterpart materials. In addition, due to their strong nonlinear absorption, both hematene and magnetene show exceptional OL performance from the UV to visible, attaining very low values of optical limiting onset (OLon), comparable and even lower than that of vdW 2D nanomaterials, such as graphene, graphene oxide, other transition metal dichalcogenides like MoS2, WS2 and MoSe2, black phosphorous and antimonene. Moreover, hematene was found to exhibit more efficient OL action than magnetene for all the excitation wavelengths studied, attributed to more efficient ligand to metal charge transfer. The present findings open new possibilities for the potential use of these non&#8208;vdW 2D materials in photonics and optoelectronics, e.&#8201;g., as optical limiters and optical switchers.

         <title>Dimension Tuning of All&#8208;Inorganic Ag&#8208;Based Metal Halides by Solvent Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, different dimensions of Cs2AgCl3 (1D) and CsAgCl2 (2D) metal halides have been synthesized in different solvents, DMF and DMSO, respectively. By comparing the functional group, dielectric constant, and donor number among four solvents (DMF, DMSO, DMAC, DMPU), we find the donor number plays the predominant role in the dimension tuning.







Abstract
Dimension growth of metal halides is important for its properties and applications. However, such dimension control of the metal halides is rarely reported in the literature and the growth mechanism is not clear yet. A minute difference of solvent properties can tremendously alter the process of nucleation and growth of crystals. Herein, an intriguing phenomenon of dimension tuning for Ag&#8208;based metal halides is reported. The 1D Cs2AgCl3 crystals can be obtained in pure DMF while the 2D CsAgCl2 crystals are obtained in pure DMSO. Both exhibit bright yellow emission, which are derived from self&#8208;trapping excitons (STEs). The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of Cs2AgCl3 (1D) and CsAgCl2 (2D) are 28.46&#8201;% and 20.61&#8201;%, respectively. In order to understand the mechanism of the dimension change, additional solvents (N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide, DMAC, 1,3&#8208;Dimethyl&#8208;Tetrahydropyrimidin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one, DMPU) are also selected to process the precursor for crystal growth. By comparing the functional group, dielectric constant, and donor number among the four solvents, we find the donor number plays the predominant role in nucleation process for Cs2AgCl3 and CsAgCl2. This research reveals the relationship between coordination ability of the solvent and the dimension of metal halides.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Human Milk Oligosaccharides: para&#8208;Lacto&#8208;N&#8208;hexaose and para&#8208;Lacto&#8208;N&#8208;neohexaose</title>

Chemical synthesis of two common core human milk oligosaccharides&#8212;para&#8208;lacto&#8208;N&#8208;hexaose (pLNH) and para&#8208;lacto&#8208;N&#8208;neohexaose (pLNnH)&#8212;using a convergent 3+3 approach has been reported.







Abstract
Human milk oligosaccharides (HMO) have emerged as a very active area of research in glycoscience and nutrition. HMO are involved in the early development of infants and may help to prevent certain diseases. The development of chemical methods for obtaining individual HMO aids the global effort dedicated to understanding the roles of these biomolecules. Reported herein is the chemical synthesis of two common core hexasaccharides found in human milk, i.&#8201;e. para&#8208;lacto&#8208;N&#8208;hexaose (pLNH) and para&#8208;lacto&#8208;N&#8208;neohexaose (pLNnH). After screening multiple leaving groups and temporary protecting group combinations, a 3+3 convergent coupling strategy was found to work best for obtaining these linear glycans.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Dependent Reactivity of Mono&#8208; and Dinuclear Boron Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
If NHC&#8208;stabilized borenium ions [NHC&#8722;BH2]+ and [PF6]&#8722; take the same bus, they will get off neutralized and with a noticeable change, i.&#8201;e., as NHC&#8722;BF3 and PH2F3. However, if tetrakis(perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butoxy)aluminate is the second passenger, the anion remains untouched and a bis(boronium) or a bis(borenium) ion can enjoy the journey.







Abstract
The dinuclear bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) borane adduct 2 rapidly reacts with tritylium salts at room temperature but the outcome is strongly impacted by the respective counter&#8208;ion. Using tritylium tetrakis(perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butoxy)aluminate affords &#8211; depending on the solvent &#8211; either the bis(boronium) ion 4 or the hydride&#8208;bridged dication 5. In case of tritylium hexafluorophosphate, however, H/F exchange occurs between boron and phosphorus yielding the dinuclear BF3 adduct 3 along with phosphorus dihydride trifluoride. H/F exchange also takes place when using the mononuclear N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene BH3 adduct 6 and hence provides a facile route to PH2F3, which is usually synthesized in more complex reaction sequences regularly involving toxic hydrogen fluoride. DFT calculations shed light on the H/F exchange between the borenium ion and the [PF6]&#8722; counter&#8208;ion and the computed mechanism features only small barriers in line with the experimental observations.

         <title>Controlling the Crystallisation and Hydration State of Crystalline Porous Organic Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High throughput screening was used to rapidly identify a new crystalline porous salt (CPOS). Using flow chemistry, the CPOS was scaled, and the material was shown to have permeant porosity with a carbon dioxide uptake of 4.3&#8197;mmol/g at 195&#8197;K, making it one of the most porous and scalable CPOS reported to date.







Abstract
Crystalline porous organic salts (CPOS) are a subclass of molecular crystals. The low solubility of CPOS and their building blocks limits the choice of crystallisation solvents to water or polar alcohols, hindering the isolation, scale&#8208;up, and scope of the porous material. In this work, high throughput screening was used to expand the solvent scope, resulting in the identification of a new porous salt, CPOS&#8208;7, formed from tetrakis(4&#8208;sulfophenyl)methane (TSPM) and tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)methane (TAPM). CPOS&#8208;7 does not form with standard solvents for CPOS, rather a hydrated phase (Hydrate2920) previously reported is isolated. Initial attempts to translate the crystallisation to batch led to challenges with loss of crystallinity and Hydrate2920 forming favorably in the presence of excess water. Using acetic acid as a dehydrating agent hindered formation of Hydrate2920 and furthermore allowed for direct conversion to CPOS&#8208;7. To allow for direct formation of CPOS&#8208;7 in high crystallinity flow chemistry was used for the first time to circumvent the issues found in batch. CPOS&#8208;7 and Hydrate2920 were shown to have promise for water and CO2 capture, with CPOS&#8208;7 having a CO2 uptake of 4.3&#8197;mmol/g at 195&#8197;K, making it one of the most porous CPOS reported to date.

         <title>Closed Synthetic Cycle for Nickel&#8208;Based Dihydrogen Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel complexes with a N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand (TIMENiPr) have been synthesized and characterized. Starting from the Ni0 precursor, a NiII hydride is synthesized that reacts with protons to form a rare Ni&#8722;H2 intermediate, which was studied by NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Further reduction closes the synthetic cycle.







Abstract
Dihydrogen evolution was observed in a two&#8208;step protonation reaction starting from a Ni0 precursor with a tripodal N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand. Upon the first protonation, a NiII monohydride complex was formed, which was isolated and fully characterized. Subsequent protonation yields H2 via a transient intermediate (INT) and an isolable NiII acetonitrile complex. The latter can be reduced to regenerate its Ni0 precursor. The mechanism of H2 formation was investigated by using a deuterated acid and scrutinized by 1H NMR spectroscopy and gas chromatography. Remarkably, the second protonation forms a rare nickel dihydrogen complex, which was detected and identified in solution and characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy. DFT&#8208;based computational analyses were employed to propose a reaction profile and a molecular structure of the Ni&#8722;H2 complex. Thus, a dihydrogen&#8208;evolving, closed&#8208;synthetic cycle is reported with a rare Ni&#8722;H2 species as a key intermediate.

&lt;p&gt;Nickel complexes with a N-heterocyclic carbene ligand (TIMEN&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;/sup&gt;) have been synthesized and characterized. Starting from the Ni&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; precursor, a Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; hydride is synthesized that reacts with protons to form a rare Ni&#8722;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intermediate, which was studied by NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Further reduction closes the synthetic cycle.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dihydrogen evolution was observed in a two-step protonation reaction starting from a Ni&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; precursor with a tripodal N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand. Upon the first protonation, a Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; monohydride complex was formed, which was isolated and fully characterized. Subsequent protonation yields H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; via a transient intermediate (INT) and an isolable Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; acetonitrile complex. The latter can be reduced to regenerate its Ni&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; precursor. The mechanism of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; formation was investigated by using a deuterated acid and scrutinized by &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR spectroscopy and gas chromatography. Remarkably, the second protonation forms a rare nickel dihydrogen complex, which was detected and identified in solution and characterized by &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR spectroscopy. DFT-based computational analyses were employed to propose a reaction profile and a molecular structure of the Ni&#8722;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; complex. Thus, a dihydrogen-evolving, closed-synthetic cycle is reported with a rare Ni&#8722;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; species as a key intermediate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recent Advances in Photo&#8208;Induced C&#8208;H Methylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct C&#8208;H methylation is a highly valuable approach for introducing methyl groups into organic molecules, particularly in pharmaceutical chemistry. Among the various methodologies available, photo&#8208;induced methylation stands out as an exceptional choice due to its mild reaction conditions, energy efficiency, and compatibility with functional groups. This article offers a comprehensive review of photochemical strategies employed for the direct and selective methylation of C(sp3)&#8208;H, C(sp2)&#8208;H, and C(sp)&#8208;H bonds in various organic molecules. The discussed methodologies encompass transition metal&#8208;based photocatalysis, organophotocatalysis, as well as other metal&#8208;free approaches, including electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA)&#8208;enabled transformations. Importantly, a wide range of easily accessible agents such as tert&#8208;butyl peroxide, methanol, DMSO, acetic acid, methyl halides, and even methane can serve as effective methylating reagents for modifying diverse targets. These advancements in photochemical C&#8208;H methylation are anticipated to drive further progress in the fields of organic synthesis, photocatalysis, and pharmaceutical development, opening up exciting avenues for creating novel organic molecules and discovering new drug compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron paramagnetic resonance, electronic ground state, and electron spin relaxation of seven lanthanide ions bound to lanmodulin and the bioinspired chelator, 3,4,3&#8208;LI(1,2&#8208;HOPO)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of lanthanide(III) ions besides Gd(III), bound to small&#8208;molecule and protein chelators, are uncharacterized. Here, we systematically investigated the EPR properties of 7 lanthanide(III) ions bound to the natural lanthanide&#8208;binding protein, lanmodulin (LanM), and the synthetic small&#8208;molecule chelator, 3,4,3&#8208;LI(1,2&#8208;HOPO) (&#8220;HOPO&#8221;). Echo&#8208;detected pulsed EPR spectra reveal intense signals from ions for which the normal continuous&#8208;wave first&#8208;derivative spectra are negligibly different from zero. Spectra of Kramers lanthanide ions Ce3+, Nd3+, Sm3+, Er3+, and Yb3+, and non&#8208;Kramers Tb3+ and Tm3+, bound to LanM are more similar to the ions in dilute aqueous:ethanol solution than to those coordinated with HOPO. Lanmodulins from two bacteria, with distinct metal&#8208;binding sites, had similar spectra for Tb3+ but different spectra for Nd3+. Spin&#8208;echo dephasing rates (1/Tm) are faster for lanthanides than for most transition metals and limited detection of echoes to temperatures below ~6 to 12 K. Dephasing rates were environment dependent and decreased in the order water:ethanol &gt; LanM &gt; HOPO, which is attributed to decreasing librational motion. Our results demonstrate that the EPR spectra and relaxation times of lanthanide(III) ions are sensitive to coordination environment, motivating wider application of these methods for characterization of both small&#8208;molecule and biomolecule interactions with lanthanides.</dc:description>

         <title>An Indacenopicene&#8208;based Buckybowl Catcher for Recognition of Fullerenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel buckybowl catcher with an extended &#960;&#8208;surface has been synthesized via cross&#8208;coupling of two bowl shaped bromoindacenopicene moieties with a tolyl linker. The obtained catcher has been unambiguously characterized by 2D&#8208;NMR and mass spectrometry. DFT calculations indicate that the curved shape of the receptor moieties is favourable for binding fullerenes. Effective binding was confirmed for interactions with C60 and C70 utilizing NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The resulting binding values show a higher affinity of the catcher towards C70 over C60. The designed catcher demonstrated the fundamental possibility of creating sensors for spherical aromaticity.</dc:description>

         <title>Weakly Self&#8208;Assembled [6]Helicenes: Circularly Polarized Light and Spin Filtering Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbo[6]helicenes decorated with 3,4,5&#8208;tris(dodecyloxy)&#8208;N&#8208;(4&#8208;ethynylphenyl)benzamide moieties at their periphery give access to weak self&#8208;assemblies with circularly polarized luminescence and spin selectivity.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembling features, chiroptical activity, and spin filtering properties are reported for 2,15&#8208; and 4,13&#8208;disubstituted [6]helicenes decorated in their periphery with 3,4,5&#8208;tris(dodecyloxy)&#8208;N&#8208;(4&#8208;ethynylphenyl)benzamide moieties. The weak non&#8208;covalent interaction between these units conditions the corresponding circularly polarized luminescence and spin polarization. The self&#8208;assembly is overall weak for these [6]helicene derivatives that, despite the formation of H&#8208;bonding interactions between the amide groups present in the peripheral moieties, shows very similar chiroptical properties both in the monomeric or aggregated states. This effect could be explained by considering the steric effect that these groups could generate in the growing of the corresponding aggregate formed. Importantly, the self&#8208;assembling features also condition chiral induced spin selectivity (CISS effect), with experimental spin polarization (SP) values found between 35&#8211;40&#8201;% for both systems, as measured by magnetic&#8208;conducting atomic force microscopy (AFM) technique.

A novel zwitterionic excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer molecular system exhibits high affinity towards amyloid &#946; (A&#946;) aggregates and allows for in&#8197;vivo near&#8208;infrared (NIR) imaging of amyloid plaques in transgenic Alzheimer's vs. wild&#8208;type mice.







Abstract
Chromophores with zwitterionic excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) have been shown to have larger Stock shifts and red&#8208;shifted emission wavelengths compared to the conventional &#960;&#8208;delocalized ESIPT molecules. However, there is still a dearth of design strategies to expand the current library of zwitterionic ESIPT compounds. Herein, a novel zwitterionic excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer system is reported, enabled by addition of 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane (TACN) fragments on a dicyanomethylene&#8208;4H&#8208;pyran (DCM) scaffold. The solvent&#8208;dependent steady&#8208;state photophysical studies, pKa measurements, and computational analysis strongly support that the ESIPT process is more efficient with two TACN groups attached to the DCM scaffold and not affected by polar protic solvents. Impressively, compound DCM&#8208;OH&#8208;2&#8208;DT exhibits a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission at 740&#8197;nm along with an uncommonly large Stokes shift. Moreover, DCM&#8208;OH&#8208;2&#8208;DT shows high affinity towards soluble amyloid &#946; (A&#946;) oligomers in&#8197;vitro and in 5xFAD mouse brain sections, and we have successfully applied DCM&#8208;OH&#8208;2&#8208;DT for the in&#8197;vivo imaging of A&#946; aggregates and demonstrated its potential use as an early diagnostic agent for AD. Overall, this study can provide a general molecular design strategy for developing new zwitterionic ESIPT compounds with NIR emission in&#8197;vivo imaging applications.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are an attractive class of electrode materials due to their outstanding advantages, such as structural designability, good stability, and ordered pore structure. The applications of COFs in the cathode, anode, and electrolyte of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are summarized, and the relationship between the structure and electrochemical performance of COFs is elaborated.







Abstract
The development and utilization of green renewable energy are imperative with the aggravation of environmental pollution and energy crisis. In recent years, the exploration of electrochemical energy storage systems has gradually become a research hotspot in energy. Among them, aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have progressively developed into highly competitive and efficient energy storage devices owing to their inherent safety, natural abundance, and higher theoretical capacity. However, the practical application of ZIBs suffers from the limitation of challenges such as the absence of proper cathode materials and the unavoidable zinc dendrites and side reactions of Zn anode. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are an attractive class of electrode materials due to their inherent advantages, like structural designability, high stability, and ordered&#8208;open channels, bestowing them with great potential to overcome the problems of ZIBs. In this review, we concentrate on the discussion of designed strategies of COFs applied to ZIBs. Furthermore, the methods of using COFs to solve the challenging problems of cathode development, anode modification, and electrolyte optimization for ZIBs are summarized. Finally, the existing difficulties, solution measures, and prospects of COFs for ZIBs applications are discussed. Our commentary hopes to serve as a valuable reference for developing COFs&#8208;based ZIBs.

         <title>Fluorescence Enhancement of Adamantane&#8208;Modified Dyes in Aqueous Solution via Supramolecular Interaction with Methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin and Their Application in Cell Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy for fluorescence enhancement in aqueous solution with high inclusion equilibrium constant based on host&#8208;guest chemistry was proposed. Fluorescent dyes based on adamantane modification could be complexed with methylated &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (M&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD). Consequently, fluorescent intensity of these dyes was significantly improved in water. And the work was further extended to fluorescent organelle targeting. Fluorescence enhancement was successfully realized in bioimaging with the addition of M&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD.







Abstract
The fluorescence of functional dyes was generally quenched in aqueous solution, which hindered their application in water&#8208;bearing detections. In this work, a novel strategy based on host&#8208;guest interaction was provided for the purpose of fluorescence enhancement in aqueous solution and cell imaging. Three adamantane&#8208;modified fluorescent dyes (Coum&#8208;Ad, NP&#8208;Ad, NR&#8208;Ad) with coumarin, 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide and Nile Red as fluorophores were initially designed and prepared. The ((adamantan&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methyl)amino group, as the auxochrome of those dyes, complexed with methylated &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (M&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD) via supramolecular interaction, and then fluorescent supramolecular nanoparticles (FSNPs) were formed by self&#8208;assembly in water. The inclusion equilibrium constant (K) could be as high as 3.94&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1. With the addition of M&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD, fluorescence quantum yields of these dyes were separately improved to 69.8&#8201;%, 32.9&#8201;% and 41.3&#8201;%. Inspired by the above satisfactory results, six adamantane&#8208;modified probes organelle&#8208;NPAds with organelle&#8208;targeting capability were further obtained. As the formation of hydrogen bonds between organelle&#8208;NPAd2 and M&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD verified by theoretical calculation, K of organelle&#8208;NPAd2 (5.13&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1~4.53&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1) with M&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD was higher than that of organelle&#8208;NPAd1 (1.15&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1~3.66&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1) and their fluorescence quantum yields increased to 32.8&#8201;%~83.6&#8201;% in aqueous solution. In addition, fluorescence enhancement was realized in cell imaging with the addition of M&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD.

         <title>Photoisomerization of &#8220;Partially Embedded Dihydropyridazine&#8221; with a Helical Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoisomerization of &#8220;partially embedded fused&#8208;dihydropyridazine N&#8208;aryl aza[5]helicene derivatives&#8221; (PDH) with a helical structure inspires the demonstration of intrinsic photo&#8208;triggered multi&#8208;functional properties based on a Kekul&#233; biradical and structural flexibility. Multiple functions, such as T&#8208;type photochromism, photo&#8208;excitation&#8208;mediated triplet biradical formation, and photoracemization, which are attributed to PDH, are revealed.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of two &#8220;partially embedded fused&#8208;dihydropyridazine N&#8208;aryl aza[5]helicene derivatives&#8221; (PDHs) and the demonstration of their intrinsic photo&#8208;triggered multi&#8208;functional properties based on a Kekul&#233; biradical structure. Introducing bulky electron&#8208;withdrawing trifluoromethyl or pentafluoroethyl groups into the aza[5]helicene framework (PDH&#8208;CF3 and &#8722;C2F5) gives PDH axial chirality based on the helicity of the P and M forms, even at room temperature. Upon photo&#8208;irradiation of PDH&#8208;CF3 in a frozen solution, an ESR signal from the triplet biradical with zero&#8208;field splitting values, generated by N&#8722;N bond dissociation, was observed. However, when the irradiation was turned off, the ESR signal became silent, thus indicating the existence of two equilibria: between the biradical and quinoidal forms based on the Kekul&#233; structure, and between N&#8722;N bond cleavage and recombination. The observed photo&#8208; and thermally induced behaviors indicate that T&#8208;type photochromic molecules are involved in the photoisomerization mechanism involving the two equilibria. Inspired by the photoisomerization, chirality control of PDH by photoracemization was achieved. Multiple functionalities, such as T&#8208;type photochromism, photo&#8208;excitation&#8208;mediated triplet biradical formation, and photoracemization, which are attributed to the &#8220;partially embedded dihydropyridazine&#8221; structure, are demonstrated.

&#8226; 1st Ge atom side&#8208;on coordination to C=N, &#8226; Novel mode of aromatic C&#8722;C bond activation by NHC, &#8226; Germanium atom transfer







Abstract
The germylone dimNHCGe (dimNHC=diimino N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) reacts with azides N3R (R=SiMe3 or p&#8208;tolyl) to furnish the first examples of germanium &#960;&#8208;complexes, i.&#8201;e. guanidine&#8208;ligated compounds (dimNHI&#8722;SiMe3)Ge (NHI=N&#8208;heterocyclic imine, R=SiMe3) and (dimNHI&#8722;Tol)Ge (R=p&#8208;tolyl). DFT calculations suggest that these species are formed by a Staudinger type replacement of dinitrogen in the azide by a nucleophilic germylone, leading to a transient carbene adduct of iminogermylidene. Heating a solution of compound (dimNHI&#8722;SiMe3)Ge to 70&#8201;&#176;C results in extrusion of the iminogermylidene that further aggregates to produce the known [Me3SiNGe]4 tetramer, whereas the imidazolylidene fragment transforms into an unusual heptatriene species that can be considered as a product of carbene insertion into the C&#8722;C bond of a pendant Ar substituent at the imidazolylidene nitrogen of the dimNHC. Reaction of (dimNHI&#8722;SiMe3)Ge with tetrachloro&#8208;o&#8208;benzoquinone results in the net transfer of a germanium atom and formation of the free diimino&#8208;guanidine ligand. This ligand also forms when (dimNHI&#8722;SiMe3)Ge is treated with azide N3(p&#8722;Tol), with the germanium product being [(p&#8722;Tol)NGe]n

         <title>Trichlates, an Unattended Class of Compounds: Characterization of Cl3CSO2Cl, and (H5O2)[Cl3CSO3]</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The so&#8208;called &#8220;trichlates&#8221; are the heavier but scarcely investigated homologues of the well&#8208;known triflates. Access to the acid (H5O2)[Cl3CSO3] is the key step for the synthesis of trichlates. The acid can be prepared by chlorination of CS2, yielding Cl3CSCl, and subsequent oxidation by H2O2 giving Cl3CSO2Cl, the chloride of the acid.







Abstract
Chlorination of CS2 leads to trichloromethanesulfenyl chloride, Cl3CSCl, in moderate yields. The oxidation of Cl3CSCl with H2O2 gives Cl3CSO2Cl, the chloride of trichloromethanesulfonic acid. Cl3CSO2Cl is the crucial product for the preparation of trichloromethanesulfonates (&#8220;trichlates&#8221;) and has been characterized by IR spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements (P&#8208;1, a=609.99(5) pm, b=727.45(6) pm, c=782.49(7) pm, &#945;=80.644(3)&#176;, &#946;=85.175(3)&#176;, &#947;=88.311(3)&#176;. The acid Cl3CSO3H can be gained in form of the hydrate (H5O2)[Cl3CSO3] in two different modifications (I: monoclinic, P21/n, Z=8, a=1292.47(7) pm, b=605.89(2) pm, c=2661.1(1) pm, &#946;=98.708(4)&#176;, V=1672.8(1) &#197;3; II: monoclinic, Cc, Z=4, a=699.80(5) pm, b=1054.72(8) pm, c=1139.88(8) pm, &#946;=95.303(3)&#176;, V=837.7(1) &#197;3. Both modifications have been investigated by IR spectroscopy, thermal analyses and theoretical calculations.

         <title>Effects of the Magnetic Orientation of M13 Bacteriophage on Phage Display Selection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In phage display selection using M13 bacteriophage, the M13 main body, which is a huge filament&gt;103&#8197;time larger than the displayed peptide, has been considered to interfere with the result of affinity selection. This interference can be attenuated by magnetically orienting the M13 main body vertical to the target surface, which results in the suppression of nonspecific adhesion and the change in the population of selected M13 clones.







Abstract
Although phage display selection using a library of M13 bacteriophage has become a powerful tool for finding peptides that bind to target materials on demand, a remaining concern of this method is the interference by the M13 main body, which is a huge filament &gt;103&#8197;times larger than the displayed peptide, and therefore would nonspecifically adhere to the target or sterically inhibit the binding of the displayed peptide. Meanwhile, filamentous phages are known to be orientable by an external magnetic field. If M13 filaments are magnetically oriented during the library selection, their angular arrangement relative to the target surface would be changed, being expected to control the interference by the M13 main body. This study reports that the magnetic orientation of M13 filaments vertical to the target surface significantly affects the selection. When the target surface was affinitive to the M13 main body, this orientation notably suppressed the nonspecific adhesion. Furthermore, when the target surface was less affinitive to the M13 main body and intrinsically free from the nonspecific adhesion, this orientation drastically changed the population of M13 clones obtained through library selection. The method of using no chemicals but only a physical stimulus is simple, clean, and expected to expand the scope of phage display selection.

         <title>Nitrogen Heterocycle Synthesis through Hydride Abstraction of Acyclic Carbamates and Related Species: Scope, Mechanism, Stereoselectivity, and Product Conformation Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acyliminium ions and related species are potent electrophiles that can be quite valuable in the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules. This manuscript describes a protocol to form these intermediates through hydride abstractions of easily accessible allylic carbamates, amides, and sulfonamides that avoids the reversibility that is possible in classical condensation&#8208;based routes. These intermediates are used in the preparation of a range of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, and in many cases high levels of sterocontrol are observed. Specifically areas of investigation include the impact of chemical structure on oxidation efficiency, the geometry of the intermediate iminium ions, the impact of a substrate stereocenter on stereocontrol, and an examination of transition state geometry.</dc:description>

         <title>Site Selectivity of Peptoids as Azobenzene Scaffold for Molecular Solar Thermal Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Storing solar energy is a key challenge in modern science. MOlecular Solar Thermal (MOST) systems, in particular those based on azobenzene switches, have received great interest in the last decades. The energy storage properties of azobenzene (t1/2 &lt; 4 days; DH~270 kJ/kg) must be improved for future applications. Herein, we introduce peptoids as programmable supramolecular scaffolds to improve the energy storage properties of azobenzene&#8208;based MOST systems. We demonstrate with 3&#8208;unit peptoids bearing a single azobenzene chromophore that dynamics of the MOST systems can be tuned depending on the anchoring position of the photochromic unit on the macromolecular backbone. We measured a remarkable increase of the half&#8208;life of the metastable form up to 14 days at 20 &#176;C for a specific anchoring site, significantly higher than the isolated azobenzene moiety, thus opening new perspectives for MOST development.

MOlecular Solar Thermal (MOST) systems, in particular those based on azobenzene switches, have received great interest in the last decades. The energy storage properties of azobenzene (t1/2 &amp;lt; 4 days; DH~270 kJ/kg) must be improved for future applications. Herein, we introduce peptoids as programmable supramolecular scaffolds to improve the energy storage properties of azobenzene-based MOST systems. We demonstrate with 3-unit peptoids bearing a single azobenzene chromophore that dynamics of the MOST systems can be tuned depending on the anchoring position of the photochromic unit on the macromolecular backbone. We measured a remarkable increase of the half-life of the metastable form up to 14 days at 20 &#176;C for a specific anchoring site, significantly higher than the isolated azobenzene moiety, thus opening new perspectives for MOST development. We also highlight that liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry does not only enable to monitor the different stereoisomers during the photoisomerization process as traditionnaly done, but also allows to determine the thermal back-isomerization kinetics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanistic Avenues in Chan&#8208;Lam based Etherification Reaction: A Computational Exploration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ongoing advances in CuII&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidative coupling reactions between arylboronic esters and diverse heteroatom nucleophiles have strengthened the development of the general Chan&#8208;Lam (CL) based reaction protocol, including the C&#8722;O bond formation methodologies. In&#8208;depth mechanistic understanding of CL etherification with specific emphasize on different reaction routes and its energetics are still lacking, even though the reaction has been experimentally explored. Here, we present a DFT&#8208;guided computational study to unravel the mechanistic pathways of the CL&#8208;based etherification reaction. The computational findings provide some interesting insights on the fundamental steps of the catalytic cycle, particularly the rate&#8208;determining transmetalation event. Aryl boronic ester coordinated, methoxide bridged CuII intermediate acts as resting state, which undergoes transmetalation accompanying an activation barrier of 20.4 kcal/mol. The energy spans of the remaining fundamental steps leading to the methoxylated product are relatively low. The minor product requires an additional 14.2 kcal/mol energy span to surmount in comparison to the favored route. Hammett studies for the substituted aryl boronic esters reveal higher reaction turnover for electron&#8208;rich aryl systems. The results agree with the previously reported spectroscopic and kinetic observations. For a series of alcohol substrates, it was observed that except for cyclohexanol, moderate to high etherification turnovers are predicted.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Boron&#8208;Containing Heteromerous Bistricyclic Aromatic Enes: Structural Effects on Thermodynamic Stability and Photoreactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Overcrowded bistricyclic aromatic enes (BAEs) have several conformations such as twisted and anti&#8208;folded conformers, and their stereochemistry and chromism have been studied in earnest. In this study, we synthesized boron&#8208;containing heteromerous BAEs having various tricyclic structures and investigated their photophysical properties. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis revealed that the introduction of a rigid fluorene unit resulted in a twisted conformer, whereas the introduction of flexible units such as thioxanthene and 9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroanthracene units resulted in an anti&#8208;folded conformer. The absorption spectra of the heteromerous BAEs were dependent on the introduced tricyclic structures, suggesting the immense impact of the tricyclic structures on the electronic structures of BAEs. DFT calculations revealed the large effect of the flexibility of the tricyclic structures on the thermodynamic stability of the conformers. In addition, the boron&#8208;containing heteromerous BAEs underwent photocyclization reactions, indicating their potential application as precursors of polyaromatic hydrocarbons and helical aromatic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Generation and Application of Homoallylic &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Diboryl Radicals via Diboron&#8208;Promoted Ring&#8208;Opening of Vinyl Cyclopropanes: cis&#8208;Diastereoselective Borylative Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon&#8208;centered radicals stabilized by adjacent boron atoms are underexplored reaction intermediates in organic synthesis. We report the development of vinyl cyclopropyl diborons (VCPDBs) as a versatile source of previously unknown homoallylic &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diboryl radicals via thiyl radical catalyzed diboron&#8208;directed ring opening. These diboryl stabilized radicals underwent smooth [3+2] cycloaddition with a variety of olefins to provide diboryl cyclopentanes in good to excellent diastereoselectivity. In contrast to the trans&#8208;diastereoselectivity observed with most of the dicarbonyl activated VCPs, the cycloaddition of VCPDBs showed a remarkable preference for formation of cis&#8208;cyclopentane diastereomer which was confirmed by quantitative NOE and 2D NOESY studies. The cis&#8208;stereochemistry of cyclopentane products enabled a concise intramolecular Heck reaction approach to rare tricyclic cyclopentanoid framework containing the diboron group. The mild reaction conditions also allowed a one&#8208;pot VCP ring&#8208;opening, cycloaddition&#8208;oxidation sequence to afford disubstituted cyclopentanones. Control experiments and DFT analysis of reaction mechanism support a radical mediated pathway and provide a rationale for the observed diastereoselectivity. To our knowledge, these are the first examples of the use of geminal diboryl group as an activator of VCP ring opening and cycloaddition reaction of &#945;&#8208;boryl radicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalization of Dodecaborates by Mild and Efficient Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Formation of B&#8208;C Bonds with Boronic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic molecules have recently received great interest due to their unique properties, which give access to their implementation in biological and material sciences. Herein, a new synthetic approach for the direct&#8208;linkage of the purely inorganic dodecaborate cluster to organic building blocks through B&#8208;C bond is established, using boronic acids as functional groups on the organic moiety, reacting under Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling conditions with iodo&#8208;undecahydridododecaborate. The choices of ligand (DavePhos) and solvent (N&#8208;methylpyrrolidone for electron&#8208;poor, CD3CN for electron&#8208;rich groups) are essential for the successful coupling. Ultimately, the newly described methodology is found to be functional&#8208;group tolerant covering a wide spectrum of substrates including electron&#8208;poor arenes.</dc:description>

         <title>HER&#8208;2&#8208;targeted Boron Neutron Capture Therapy with Carborane&#8208;integrated Immunoliposomes Prepared via an Exchanging Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is a promising modality for cancer treatment because of its minimal invasiveness. To maximize the therapeutic benefits of BNCT, the development of efficient platforms for the delivery of boron agents is indispensable. Here, we prepared carborane&#8208;integrated immunoliposomes via an exchanging reaction to achieve HER&#8208;2&#8208;targeted BNCT. The conjugation of an anti&#8208;HER&#8208;2 antibody to carborane&#8208;integrated liposomes successfully endowed these liposome with targeting properties toward HER&#8208;2&#8208;overexpressing human ovarian cancer cells (SK&#8208;OV3); the resulting BNCT activity toward SK&#8208;OV3 cells obtained using the current immunoliposomal system was 14&#8208;fold that of the l&#8208;BPA/fructose complex, which is a clinically available boron agent. Moreover, the growth of spheroids treated with our system followed by thermal neutron irradiation was significantly suppressed compared with treatment with the l&#8208;BPA/fructose complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual strategies with anion/cation co&#8208;doping and lithium carbonate coating to enhance the electrochemical performance of Li&#8208;rich layered oxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides (LLOs, Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2) are widely used as cathode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to its high specific capacity, high operating voltage and low cost. However, the LLOs are faced with rapid decay of charge/discharge capacity and voltage, as well as interface side reactions, which limit its electrochemical performance. Herein, the dual strategies of sulfite/sodium ion co&#8208;doping and lithium carbonate coating were used to improve it. It founds that modified LLOs achieve 88.74% initial coulomb efficiency, 295.3 mAh g&#8211;1 first turn discharge capacity, in addition to 216.9 mAh g&#8211;1 at 1 C, and 87.23% capacity retention after 100 cycles. Mechanism research indicated that the excellent electrochemical performance benefits from the doping of both Na+ and SO32&#8208;, and it could significantly reduce the migration energy barrier of Li+ and promote Li+ migration. Meanwhile, anion and cation are co&#8208;doped greatly reduces the band gap of LLOs and increase its electrical conductivity, and no electron spin barrier leap effect at the Fermi level. In addition, the lithium carbonate coating significantly inhibits the occurrence of interfacial side reactions of LLOs. This work provides a theoretical basis and practical guidance for the further development of LLOs with higher electrochemical performance.</dc:description>

However, the LLOs are faced with rapid decay of charge/discharge capacity and voltage, as well as interface side reactions, which limit its electrochemical performance. Herein, the dual strategies of sulfite/sodium ion co-doping and lithium carbonate coating were used to improve it. It founds that modified LLOs achieve 88.74% initial coulomb efficiency, 295.3 mAh g&#8211;1 first turn discharge capacity, in addition to 216.9 mAh g&#8211;1 at 1 C, and 87.23% capacity retention after 100 cycles. Mechanism research indicated that the excellent electrochemical performance benefits from the doping of both Na+ and SO32-, and it could significantly reduce the migration energy barrier of Li+ and promote Li+ migration. Meanwhile, anion and cation are co-doped greatly reduces the band gap of LLOs and increase its electrical conductivity, and no electron spin barrier leap effect at the Fermi level. In addition, the lithium carbonate coating significantly inhibits the occurrence of interfacial side reactions of LLOs.
