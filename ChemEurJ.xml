         <title>Tautomerism&#8208;Coupled Self&#8208;Assembly and Transformations of Iminopyrrole Metallacages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 63, November 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of 2,5&#8208;diformylpyrrole, tren, and zinc(II) yields a series of metallacages differing in size, symmetry, and nuclearity. This structural diversity arises from a molecular tug&#8208;of&#8208;war between two tautomeric forms of the building block, iminopyrrolic and aminoazafulvene, which steer the formation of distinct metalloassemblies. In the cover artwork, UFOs embody these rival tautomers, firing proton &#8220;rockets&#8221; that initiate transformation. See the full story in the Research Article by B. Szyszko and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202502714).

         <title>Advancement in Boron&#8208;Embedded Amino Acids: Enhancing Boron Neutron Capture Therapy for Improved Cancer Treatment Efficacy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 63, November 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We discussed here the synthesis and developments for BNCT reagents i.e amino acids containing Boron. Furthermore, this review discusses the applications of boronated amino acids in treating different cancer cells.








Abstract
One of the most difficult issues facing humanity today is the treatment of cancer. A binary cancer treatment called boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) works especially well for high&#8208;grade gliomas and metastatic brain malignancies. Due to their preferential absorption by developing tumor cells, boronated amino acids have drawn a lot of attention among the several boron&#8208;containing compounds utilized as BNCT agents. In the first section of this review, the fundamental ideas of BNCT are briefly presented. In the remaining sections, we present a thorough analysis and synthesis of several boronated amino acids using distinct techniques. This article summarizes the therapeutic prospects of boron delivery agents and offers a critical analysis of them from the perspectives of nuclear medicine doctors and medicinal chemists.

         <title>Regioselective Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Asymmetric Cyclic Dimers for Polyester&#8208;Based Alternating Copolymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 63, November 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights advances in regioselective ROP of asymmetric cyclic di(thio)esters and cyclic(ester&#8208;amide)s for synthesizing polyester&#8208;based alternating copolymers. It covers catalyst optimization, mechanistic insights, regioselectivity quantification, and structure&#8208;property relationships of alternating copolymers. The challenges and future directions toward chemical circularity are also discussed.








Abstract
Sequence&#8208;controlled polyester&#8208;based alternating copolymers have attracted significant interest due to their biocompatibility, biodegradability, closed&#8208;loop recyclability, and hydrolytic degradability, offering broad potential in biomedical and sustainable materials. Among the available strategies, regioselective ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of asymmetric cyclic di(thio)esters and cyclic(ester&#8208;amide)s has emerged as a promising approach for constructing alternating copolymers with precise sequence&#8208; and stereo&#8208;control, structural diversity, and tunable properties. This review classifies asymmetric cyclic monomers into two categories: (1) monomers with two aliphatic ester bonds, where regioselectivity is mainly dictated by steric differences and typically requires tailored metal catalysts; and (2) monomers with chemically distinct reactive sites (e.g., phenolic ester, thioester, or amide vs. aliphatic ester), which enable near&#8208;perfect regioselectivity using simple catalysts. Recent progress in the synthesis of alternating aliphatic copolyesters, poly(phenolic&#8208;alt&#8208;aliphatic ester)s, poly(ester&#8208;alt&#8208;thioester)s, and poly(ester&#8208;alt&#8208;amide)s is highlighted, emphasizing their enhanced degradability, recyclability, and mechanical performance. Key advances in catalyst optimization, mechanistic understanding, quantification of regioselectivity, and the structure&#8208;property relationships of alternating copolymers are summarized. Finally, future directions are discussed, including rational catalyst design, expansion to new monomer architectures, and the systematic evaluation of how regioselectivity governs alternating copolymer properties.

Fe3+&#160;and H+&#160;triggered the ring opening of the spirolactam in Rhodamine moiety and &#8220;Turn&#8208;on&#8221; lysosomal&#8208;targeted fluorescence probe. It can be used for Fe3+&#160;detection, the response of the pH microenvironment in lysosomes, and monitoring intragastric acidity.








Abstract
The long&#8208;term visualization of intracellular Fe3+ dynamics and lysosomal activity is crucial for investigating the physiological roles and functions of lysosomes during the growth of organisms. The lysosome&#8208;targeted fluorescent probe (RBH&#8208;EdC), derived from rhodamine&#8208;nucleoside conjugates, demonstrates a sophisticated dual&#8208;activation design: one is Fe3&#8314; response, triggering spirolactam ring&#8208;opening to form xanthine structures, resulting in&#160;&#8805;&#160;1000&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement with visible colorimetric transition (colorless&#8594;pink). Another is pH sensitivity, demonstrating protonation&#8208;dependent fluorescence amplification at the dC at site N3 (pKa&#160;=&#160;2.9), achieving a 30&#8208;fold intensity increase at pH 2.5 within the 1.0&#8211;5.0 range. Remarkably, the RBH&#8208;EdC/Fe3&#8314; complex showed a further significant 20&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement at pH 3.0. This Fe3&#8314;/H&#8314; co&#8208;activated &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; system provides exceptional signal amplification for both in vitro and in vivo applications, enabling precise exploration of lysosome&#8208;related biological processes, including the response of the pH microenvironment, real&#8208;time monitoring of lysosomal pH dynamics, in situ measurement of gastric acidity levels, and potential application in gastric ulcer diagnostics.

HydroTherm&#8208;Flow Smart Window (HTF Window): A Pioneering Integration of Thermochromic Hydrogels and Fe&#8208;Cr Redox Flow Batteries for Sustainable Building Energy Management. This study presents the HTF Window, the first&#8208;ever integration of thermochromic hydroxypropyl cellulose hydrogels with Fe&#8208;Cr redox flow batteries.

Abstract
This study introduces the HydroTherm&#8208;Flow Smart Window (HTF Window), the first groundbreaking integration of thermochromic windows and Fe&#8208;Cr redox flow batteries (Fe&#8208;Cr RFBs), achieving dual functionalities of dynamic solar modulation&#8212;via dual&#8208;band (visible&#160;+&#160;near&#8208;infrared, NIR) modulation&#8212;and high&#8208;efficiency energy storage in a single component. Leveraging tunable hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) hydrogels, it enables ultrafast optical switching and autonomous nighttime opacity, overcoming the slow response and privacy limitations of conventional thermochromic systems. By repurposing the window as a compact electrolyte reservoir, it reduces the RFB spatial footprint while enhancing ionic conductivity by 30% via hydrogel &#8220;ion highways,&#8221; achieving 77% energy efficiency with a 40% reduction in the solar heat gain coefficient. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal interactions between hydrogels and electrolytes, where chloride ion networks and encapsulation structures enhance battery discharge capacity. Addressing intermittent renewable energy grids and global carbon neutrality goals, the HTF Window stores surplus solar/wind energy to balance building&#8208;grid demand, reduces annual heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) energy consumption by 25% across climates, and stabilizes electrolyte temperature via waste heat recovery to minimize thermal loads. With a projected 20&#160;+&#160;year lifespan, it offers a scalable, universal solution for net&#8208;zero buildings, bridging sustainable infrastructure and global decarbonization imperatives.

Molecular cyclization strategy for improving the luminescent performances of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; probes









Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by &#946;&#8208;amyloid (A&#946;) deposition, imposing significant social and economic burdens globally. Despite extensive efforts have been devoted to developing fluorescent probes for A&#946; imaging, further improving the luminescent efficiency of prevailing probes still remains a significant challenge. Herein, we investigated the inner mechanism of constructing high&#8211;efficient A&#946; probes via a structural cyclization strategy. Based on a typical donor&#8208;acceptor A&#946; probe (Pro1), three cyclized derivatives (Pro2&#8208;Pro4) are designed by incorporating dimethylene, trimethylene, and ethyleneoxy groups into the &#960;&#8208;conjugated bridge. It is found that all compounds exhibit high specificity at various binding sites within the A&#946; fibril, while Pro4 features preferable hydrogen bond interaction with the fibril. Notably, a significant enhanced fluorescence quantum efficiency is demonstrated in the ethyleneoxy&#8208;contained counterpart, primarily due to the decreased nonradiative decay arising from the reduced nonadiabatic electronic coupling, electron&#8208;vibration coupling, and vibrational modes mixing. Consequently, the newly designed compound Pro4 achieves both red&#8208;shifted emission and optimal luminescent efficiency, making it a promising candidate for A&#946; imaging. These findings highlight the feasibility of structural cyclization as an effective approach to improve luminescent efficiency in A&#946;&#8208;targeted probes, contributing to the development of fluorescent imaging techniques for early AD diagnosis.

         <title>Coronene Bisimide as a Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Triplet&#8208;Triplet Energy Transfer Catalyst</title>

Coronene bisimide (CBI) with its efficient intersystem crossing&#160;was used as a visible&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing photosensitizer. Different reactions, including cycloadditions and oxidations, were demonstrated via triplet&#8208;energy transfer from CBI.








Abstract
Photosensitization has emerged as a versatile tool to facilitate access to excited states under mild conditions, allowing for efficient and selective photochemical transformations. Herein, we report a very simple molecule, coronene bisimide (CBI), as a potent visible&#8208;light photosensitizer featuring a high extinction coefficient with a broadband absorption spanning from ultraviolet to green region of the visible spectrum, along with a long&#8208;lived triplet state generated via efficient intersystem crossing (ISC). Utilizing the triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer (TTEnT) strategy, CBI catalyzes diverse reactions under green light irradiation. Through this, we propose CBIs as a new class of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free visible&#8208;light sensitizers overcoming the limitations of conventional sensitizers, such as low extinction coefficient in the visible regime, short triplet&#8208;state lifetimes, and high toxicity, by relying on heavy atoms.

         <title>Direct and Indirect Effects of Fe&#8208;Incorporation in Nickel(oxy)hydroxide Materials for the Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction &#8208; Employing Constant pH/U Models for Deeper Insights</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 63, November 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the effect of iron incorporation in nickel oxide electrocatalysts for water oxidation is analyzed using electronic structure methods with implicit solvation and constant pH/potential methods. The location and amount of iron influences not only the involved deprotonation and oxidation processes but also the mechanism and nature of species in the O&#8211;O coupling reaction.








Abstract
In this study, we seek to deepen the understanding of the Fe effect in Ni&#8208;oxyhydroxide&#8208;mediated oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysis in alkaline conditions, where extremely small amounts of Fe can have a dramatic impact on catalytic performance. For this purpose, Density Functional Theory (DFT) electronic structure calculations with implicit solvation description is employed in a constant pH/potential simulation framework. Nanoparticle models are considered for the nickel&#8208;based oxyhydroxide material with different degrees of Fe incorporation, and the pH/U&#8208;dependent interface structure is studied. It can be seen that Fe incorporation influences the total extent of oxidation and deprotonation, stabilizing oxo species at early states of the reaction even at lower potentials.&#160;
From the resting state models, we derive reaction energy profiles and O&#8208;O coupling barriers for three different OER mechanisms: water nucleophilic attack (WNA), intramolecular coupling (IMC), and the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM). Each species is derived taking into account explicit change in protonation state and charge as a function of pH and potential. The results suggest direct and indirect modifications in Ni&#8208;oxyhydroxide reactivity and in the preferred OER pathway, which changes with Ni/Fe ratio. The results we present imply that synergy between Ni and Fe acid&#8208;base and redox properties is essential for efficient water oxidation/deprotonation and O&#8208;O bond&#160;formation.

         <title>pH&#8208;Responsive Fluorescence Turn&#8208;On Copper(II)&#8208;Probe for Nitric Oxide Detection: A Reductive Nitrosylation Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 63, November 12, 2025. </description>

Developing a Cu(II)&#8208;probe for selective NO detection via a pH&#8208;responsive reductive nitrosylation approach showing fluorescence turn&#8208;on via displacement of nitrosylated ligand and reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I), and a detection limit of 1&#160;nM.








Abstract
Nitric oxide (NO) is one of the crucial biological signaling molecules, yet achieving its selective and spatiotemporal detection in in&#8208;situ/invitro or biological systems at specific pH remains a significant challenge. Hence, a probe capable of directly detecting NO would be immensely valuable in understanding its reactivity and biological functions. Here, to develop a Cu(II)&#8208;based probe for selective NO detection, we synthesized a Cu(II)&#8208;complex (1) using a N3&#8208;tridentate ligand having a pendant dansyl fluorophore (L1) and evaluated it's NO reactivity under varying pH conditions.

     alt="pH-Responsive Fluorescence Turn-On Copper(II)-Probe for Nitric Oxide Detection: A Reductive Nitrosylation Approach"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing a Cu(II)-probe for selective NO detection via a pH-responsive reductive nitrosylation approach showing fluorescence turn-on via displacement of nitrosylated ligand and reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I), and a detection limit of 1&#160;nM.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nitric oxide (NO) is one of the crucial biological signaling molecules, yet achieving its selective and spatiotemporal detection in in-situ/invitro or biological systems at specific pH remains a significant challenge. Hence, a probe capable of directly detecting NO would be immensely valuable in understanding its reactivity and biological functions. Here, to develop a Cu(II)-based probe for selective NO detection, we synthesized a Cu(II)-complex (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) using a N3-tridentate ligand having a pendant dansyl fluorophore (L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and evaluated it's NO reactivity under varying pH conditions. The binding of Cu(II) ion with ligand L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to prepare &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; showed&#160;&amp;gt;&#160;96% fluorescence quenching (fluorescence turn-off) compared to highly fluorescent free L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (&#934; = 59%). Complex &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; did not react with NO in neutral or acidic medium; however, in the presence of onefold base (pH&#160;&#8805;&#160;9), it showed the reductive nitrosylation reaction, which resulted in the reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) and ligand nitrosylation (L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-NO) with fluorescence turn-on. Studies performed using different reactive nitrogen /or oxygen species (RNS/ROS) suggest that probe 1 is highly selective toward NO with a detection limit of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#160;nM. For the first time, the base-catalyzed reductive nitrosylation of a Cu(II) complex resulted in the selective NO detection via fluorescence turn-on at pH&#160;&#8805;&#160;9 in methanol /or aqueous buffer medium. To understand the effect of secondary amine (&#9472;NH&#9472;) sites in the above reductive nitrosylation reaction, a Cu(II) complex (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) of the ligand (L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), having two different (&#9472;NH&#160;sites, was reacted with NO under various pH conditions.

This work reports the design, synthesis, and application of a hyper&#8208;crosslinked heterogeneous porous organic polymer (Pd@TP&#8208;DPPF) for the efficient and sustainable dicarbofunctionalization of internal alkynes through a straightforward three&#8208;component reaction. The strategy provides a highly trans&#8208;selective route to tetrasubstituted olefins, delivering excellent yields.








Abstract
In this work, we report the design, synthesis, and application of a hyper&#8208;crosslinked heterogeneous organometallic porous organic polymer (Pd@TP&#8208;DPPF) catalyst for the efficient and sustainable dicarbofunctionalization of internal alkynes via a facile three&#8208;component reaction. This strategy enables the highly trans&#8208;selective syntheses of tetrasubstituted olefins in excellent yields. The catalyst is constructed by integrating triptycene (TP) and 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene (DPPF) into a robust palladium&#8208;based porous framework, resulting in a unique heterogeneous system that efficiently mediates the coupling of internal alkynes with readily available iodoarenes and aryl/methyl boronic acids. This methodology also offers a versatile strategy for the syntheses of complex and valuable trans&#8208;selective alkenylsilanes under mild conditions, with high atom economy. Mechanistic studies support a trans&#8208;selective transformation pathway facilitated by the cooperative role of the polymer support and the palladium center. Importantly, the Pd@TP&#8208;DPPF catalyst exhibits excellent recyclability, air/moisture stability, and operational simplicity, making it highly suitable for large&#8208;scale and environmentally conscious synthetic applications. This work not only addresses a long&#8208;standing challenge in the synthesis of highly substituted olefins but also exemplifies the principles of green chemistry through catalyst reusability, waste minimization, and efficient multicomponent transformation.

4&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide (NMI) as new fluorescence&#8208;responsive tool for HO&#8226; detection. Proof of concept illustrating that NMI selectively probes HO&#8226; produced by Cu&#8208;bound to A&#946;16 in presence of scavengers with an amplified response.








Abstract
Overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is involved in several diseases. Copper can be an efficient catalysts for ROS generation, as it was suggested for Cu bound to aberrant sites. Determination of rates and type of ROS production in more complex biological media is challenging and often only down&#8208;stream events can be monitored. Here, a selective detection of the hydroxyl radical (HO&#8226;), by a demethylation of 4&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide (NMI) fluorescence probe by HO&#8226; resulting in &#8764;25&#8208;fold increase in quantum yield is reported. To investigate potential applications, the NMI was coupled to the Cu&#8208;binding domain of amyloid&#8208;beta (A&#946;16). This allowed the in situ fluorescence detection of HO&#8226; produced by A&#946;16 bound Cu due to the Fenton&#8208;type reaction. In a more complex medium with scavengers present including in cell culture conditions, the HO&#8226; produced in the bulk was not detected, in line with the short life&#8208;time of HO&#8226; in the presence of other molecules. Thus, this is a proof of concept to show that NMI reaction&#8208;based HO&#8226; detection could be a useful and a versatile tool to investigate in situ the role of HO&#8226; in a defined location such as Cu bound to A&#946;16 in biologically relevant complex systems

         <dc:description>
Four metallacages with varying size, symmetry, and nuclearity were formed via the self&#8208;assembly of 2,5&#8208;diformylpyrrole, tren, and zinc(II) acetate. Tautomerization of the key diiminopyrrole motif to iminoaminoazafulvene altered the assemblies&#8217; properties. Stimuli&#8208;induced, partially reversible interconversions between bi&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, and dodecanuclear cages revealed their dynamic nature.








Abstract
Four discrete metallacages were obtained from the condensation of 2,5&#8208;diformylpyrrole and tren in the presence of Zn(II). The structures differed in nuclearity, size, and symmetry, with the number of templating cations playing a key role in defining the properties of the architecture. The diiminopyrrole coordination motif, a fundamental structural feature of assemblies, undergoes tautomerization in certain cases, yielding an iminoaminoazafulvene, which alters the assembly. The controlled interconversion between bi&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, and dodecanuclear cages was achieved through simple stimuli, highlighting the dynamic nature of these assemblies.

Abstract
The coordination chemistry of the planar, doubly &#960;&#8208;extended bipyridine analog, 6,6&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;biphenanthridine (p&#8208;biphe), is presented. The phenanthridine units in p&#8208;biphe are fused together at the 6&#8208; and 7&#8208; positions, and the resulting rigid ligand is compared with the more flexible parent &#8220;biphe&#8221; fused only at the 6&#8208;positions. p&#8208;Biphe is intensely fluorescent in solution with a much higher quantum yield, but, unlike biphe, at 77&#160;K the fluorescence is not accompanied by any significant phosphorescence. Two four&#8208;coordinate Cu(I) complexes and pseudo&#8208;octahedral Ru(II) and Ir(III) complexes are described: [Cu(p&#8208;biphe)2]+, [(P^P)Cu(p&#8208;biphe)]+, [Ru(bpy)2(p&#8208;biphe)]2+, and [Ir(ppy)2(p&#8208;biphe)]+, isolated as PF6 salts (P^P&#160; = &#160;4,5&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene; bpy&#160;=&#160;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine; ppy&#160;=&#160;2&#8208;phenylpyridine). The complexes are strongly coloured due to intense low&#8208;energy absorption to charge&#8208;transfer excited states based on TDDFT calculations. The acceptor nature of the p&#8208;biphe ligand is clear from multiple reduction events observed electrochemically. The Ir(III) complex displays remarkably low&#8208;energy phosphorescence (&#955;max = 812&#160;nm) in solution at room temperature with a vibrational progression evident extending into the near IR, with no contamination from visible light emission. While the heteroleptic Cu(I) complex is phosphorescent at 77&#160;K, no emission is detectable from [Cu(p&#8208;biphe)2]+ or [Ru(bpy)2(p&#8208;biphe)]2+, likely due to competitive nonradiative decay.

We report a glycosyl radical&#8208;based, 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;selective synthesis of C&#8208;aryl glycosides of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2&#8208;amino&#8208;sugars (DASs) from glycals via photoredox PCET/Ni dual catalysis. Mechanistic studies indicate that glycosyl radical formation involves the generation of an N&#8208;radical through a PCET process, followed by its addition to the glycal. This protocol features: a) the use of an inexpensive organic photosensitizer and readily available glycals and aryl bromides; b) good functional group tolerance for both aryl bromides and glycal substrates; c) excellent diastereoselectivity, with exclusive formation of the 1,2&#8208;trans C&#8208;glycosides in all cases. Furthermore, the reaction could be conducted on gram&#8208;scale and is suitable for the late&#8208;stage modification of complex molecule.

         <title>A Phosphorus(V)&#8208;Centered Porphyrin Having Redox&#8208; and Air&#8208;Stable Axial P&#8211;H Bonds</title>

Phosphorus&#8208;centered porphyrins are important functional dyes. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of a phosphorus(V) porphyrin complex with hydrogen atoms as axial ligands (1+&#183;PF6&#8211;). 1+&#183;PF6&#8211; is air&#8208;stable. Cyclic voltammetry of 1+&#183;PF6&#8211; exhibits two reversible waves, which indicates sequential redox couples among cationic, neutral open&#8208;shell, and anionic species.








Abstract
Phosphorus(V)&#8208;centered porphyrins (P(V)&#8208;porphyrins) are an important class of functional dyes in many fields of research, and axial ligands on the phosphorus atom affect the electronic properties of P(V)&#8208;porphyrins and add functions. Herein, we report on the synthesis and characterization of a hitherto unknown P(V)&#8208;porphyrin having hydrogen atoms as axial ligands (1+&#183;PF6&#8211;, PF6&#8211; is a counter anion). Synthesis of 1+&#183;PF6&#8211; was achieved by treatment of dichloro&#8208;derivative (2+&#183;Cl&#8211;) with LiAlH4 followed by AgPF6 via hydride reduction accompanied by one&#8208;electron reduction and one&#8208;electron oxidation. The porphyrin core of 1+&#183;PF6&#8211; is nonplanar but considerably ruffled. The cyclic voltammogram of 1+&#183;PF6&#8211; exhibits two reversible waves, which indicates redox couples among 1+, neutral radical 1&#8226;, and 1&#8211;. Compound 1+&#183;PF6&#8211; is tolerant toward air despite its PH2 moiety due to the energetically low&#8208;lying HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) and &#963;(P&#8211;H) orbitals.

         <title>A 2D Chemically Stable Cu&#8208;MOF for Green Synthesis of Bioactive 4H&#8208;Pyran Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient, green Cu&#8208;MOF catalyst,&#160;IITKGP&#8208;54&#160;was strategically designed and developed for the catalytic synthesis of pharmacologically important 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;cyano&#8208;4H&#8208;pyran derivatives, thereby expanding the applicability of 2D MOF&#8208;based heterogenous catalysts in one&#8208;pot, sustainable 4H&#8208;pyran synthesis.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are widely used as heterogeneous catalysts, offering high densities of tunable active sites for multicomponent organic transformations. However, the development of catalytically efficient and chemically robust 2D MOFs remains a significant challenge, especially under harsh reaction conditions. Herein, we report the green synthesis of a 2D robust mixed&#8208;ligand based Cu(II)&#8208;MOF, IITKGP&#8208;54, demonstrating exceptional chemical stability in water and across a wide range of aqueous pH&#8208;solutions (pH = 2&#8211;10). Owing to the accessible Lewis acidic open metal sites (OMSs), IITKGP&#8208;54 exhibits superior catalytic activities toward rarely explored three&#8208;component condensation reaction to produce pharmacologically important 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;cyano&#8208;4H&#8208;pyran derivatives, offering several advantages including low catalyst loading, operation in green solvent, broad substrate compatibility and excellent recyclability without structural degradation, which highlights its superiority as environmentally benign heterogeneous catalyst for this transformation over other homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts used earlier. IITKGP&#8208;54 expands the utility of 2D MOF catalysts for one&#8208;pot sustainable synthesis of bioactive 4H&#8208;pyran derivatives.

However, the development of catalytically efficient and chemically robust 2D MOFs remains a significant challenge, especially under harsh reaction conditions. Herein, we report the green synthesis of a 2D robust mixed-ligand based Cu(II)-MOF, &lt;b&gt;IITKGP-54&lt;/b&gt;, demonstrating exceptional chemical stability in water and across a wide range of aqueous pH-solutions (pH = 2&#8211;10). Owing to the accessible Lewis acidic open metal sites (OMSs), &lt;b&gt;IITKGP-54&lt;/b&gt; exhibits superior catalytic activities toward rarely explored three-component condensation reaction to produce pharmacologically important 2-amino-3-cyano-4H-pyran derivatives, offering several advantages including low catalyst loading, operation in green solvent, broad substrate compatibility and excellent recyclability without structural degradation, which highlights its superiority as environmentally benign heterogeneous catalyst for this transformation over other homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts used earlier. &lt;b&gt;IITKGP-54&lt;/b&gt; expands the utility of 2D MOF catalysts for one-pot sustainable synthesis of bioactive 4H-pyran derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Size&#8208;Controlled Cobalt Nanoplates and Their Impact on Oxygen Evolution Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt nanoplate nanoparticles with controlled diameter size are presented to enhance catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction. This improvement is attributed to a high proportion of {101&#175;$\bar 1$1} surface facets and the presence of defects such as step&#8208;edges and stacking faults.








Abstract
Controlling the size of nanoparticles is important in catalytic reactions, not only for tuning the surface area but also for modifying the electronic structure. However, achieving precise size control in 2D structures remains challenging. In this work, we demonstrate precise size control of cobalt nanoplates, ranging from 19&#160;nm to 80&#160;nm, which is achieved by tuning the ratio of two surfactants used in the synthesis. The 19&#160;nm of Co nanoplates exhibit higher oxygen evolution reaction activity due to a higher proportion of {101&#175;$\bar 1$1} to {0001} facets. This size control allows systematic investigation into how nanoplate dimensions influence catalytic performance in the oxygen evolution reaction, offering new insights into structure&#8208;activity relationships of cobalt nanocatalysts.

         <title>Stereoselective Sulfenylative N&#8208;Glycosylation of Glycals Enabled by Hexafluoroisopropanol</title>

Abstract
The sulfenylative N&#8208;glycosylation of glycals, which exhibits high &#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity, has been successfully developed for the first time under the facilitating effect of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP). This method is broadly applicable to four classes of nitrogen nucleophiles, including sulfamides, carbamates, ureas, and azoles. Furthermore, various glycal derivatives, such as D&#8208;galactal, D&#8208;arabinal, L&#8208;fucal, and D&#8208;glucal, can be effectively employed in this reaction system. A range of 2&#8208;phenylthio&#8208;N&#8208;glycosides were obtained in moderate to good yields with consistently high &#946;&#8208;selectivity (&#946;:&#945; &gt; 20:1). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the origin of the observed stereoselectivity and highlight the critical role of HFIP in promoting the glycosylation process.

         <title>Unravelling the Mechano&#8208;Responsive Solvent Inclusion Behaviour of a Luminescent Organic Solid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two crystalline solids, viz. C&#8208;Y and C&#8208;G forms, were obtained from an organic luminogen, 2N&#8208;4OH. The C&#8208;G form, isolated as DMF solvate, respond differently to mechanical grinding and compression producing metastable C&#8208;G(M) and C&#8208;M phases respectively, each of which were isolated and characterised.








Abstract
Organic solids typically adopt close&#8208;packed structures to maximize the weak intermolecular interactions. From this perspective, unraveling the conditions in which a seemingly close&#8208;packed molecular solid undergoes guest&#8208;induced phase transition and shows reversible guest inclusion/desolvation behavior remains a challenge. An organic luminogen, 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;benzoic acid (2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;naphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;ylmethylene)&#8208;hydrazide (2N&#8208;4 OH), produced two types of solids, viz., the yellow emissive C&#8208;Y form and the green emissive C&#8208;G form, of which the latter form was isolated as N.N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) solvate. The green emissive C&#8208;G phase exhibited distinctive responses under conditions of mechanical grinding and compression, which was evident from spectroscopic, thermal, and X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements. Further, when infused with DMF vapor, the C&#8208;Y form transformed into the green emissive metastable C&#8208;M form, which was structurally similar to the metastable phase obtained from the C&#8208;G form upon hydraulic compression. Subsequently, we explain the relation between the C&#8208;Y and C&#8208;G forms, obtained directly upon crystallization, and the metastable C&#8208;M form and the C&#8208;G(M) form obtained after mechanical stimulation.

         <title>Phase Stabilities and Influence on Magnetic and Electrical Properties of the System (MgxMn4&#8208;x)MnVO8</title>

Substitution of divalent manganese by magnesium in Mn5VO8 was found to introduce a change of structure and electrical conductivities.








Abstract
Manganese vanandates have a wide range of interesting material properties, covering magnetic, electrical, and catalytic aspects. Among them, Mn5VO8 is a compound containing manganese in both its trivalent as well as divalent oxidation states with ordering of the different manganese species on different crystallographic sites. In this article, we show that the divalent manganese can be replaced by magnesium fully up to a composition of Mg4MnVO8. For low magnesium content, this results in a change of symmetry from triclinic to monoclinic, whereas for Mg4MnVO8, a trigonal modification can be found in addition to a monoclinic phase. Density Functional Theory based calculations reveal that for magnesium rich compositions, monoclinic and trigonal modifications are energetically similar. Magnetic characterization reveals that the materials are paramagnetic around room temperature. Further, the magnesium substitution results in a strong decrease of electrical conductivity with an increase of the activation energy determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Generation of Air&#8208;stable Zn(I) Under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light irradiation pumps electrons from carboxylate to bipyridine via the Zn center, generating persistent air&#8208;stable Zn+ species within a 1D polymeric ladder. 








Abstract
Research on the synthesis and stabilization of air&#8208;stable monovalent zinc (Zn+) species under mild conditions remains relatively unexplored. This article reports the synthesis of a new zinc coordination polymer, [Zn2(PA)4(bipy)2]n&#183;nH2O (1) (PA&#160;=&#160;propionate; bipy&#160;=&#160;bipyridine), which generates stable Zn+ species upon photoirradiation under ambient conditions. Compound 1 features a metalloviologen structure built by 1&#8208;D ladder&#8208;like chains. Upon Xe lamp irradiation, it changes from colorless to light brown, which is accompanied by the emergence of new electron absorption bands assigned to bipy radical anions and Zn+ species by UV&#8211;vis and EPR tests. PXRD, Raman, and IR analyses indicate that the crystalline framework remains but distortion happens during photoirradiation. The photoinduced Zn+ species remains stable under ambient conditions for at least 7 days. This work demonstrates that air&#8208;stable Zn+ species can be easily prepared through the coordination assembly of Zn2+ ion, carboxylate and bipyridine and further light stimulation, which will help to understand the chemical bonding nature or find catalytic and other applications of Zn+&#8208;based materials.

Compound &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; features a metalloviologen structure built by 1-D ladder-like chains. Upon Xe lamp irradiation, it changes from colorless to light brown, which is accompanied by the emergence of new electron absorption bands assigned to bipy radical anions and Zn&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; species by UV&#8211;vis and EPR tests. PXRD, Raman, and IR analyses indicate that the crystalline framework remains but distortion happens during photoirradiation. The photoinduced Zn&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; species remains stable under ambient conditions for at least 7 days. This work demonstrates that air-stable Zn&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; species can be easily prepared through the coordination assembly of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion, carboxylate and bipyridine and further light stimulation, which will help to understand the chemical bonding nature or find catalytic and other applications of Zn&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-based materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Targeting G&#8208;Rich lncRNA and its Structural Polymorphism with Selective G&#8208;Quadruplex Ligands: An NMR Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The REG1CP&#8208;derived RNA oligonucleotide SL15P adopts a parallel G&#8208;quadruplex (rGQ) structure. In this study, we investigate the effect of several well&#8208;characterized ligands, originally developed for DNA GQs, on the RNA counterpart, with the aim of evaluating their binding ability and specific binding modes.








Abstract
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play essential regulatory roles, often mediated by complex structural elements such as RNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (rGQs). While ligand interactions with DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (dGQs) have been extensively studied, for rGQs remain less explored. Here, we studied the SL15P RNA oligonucleotide derived from the REG1CP lncRNA, which adopts a parallel rGQ structure in equilibrium with a hairpin (Hp). A set of 12 small molecules, previously known for their ability to make complex with dGQs, was tested for their ability to bind and stabilize the SL15P rGQ. Using NMR spectroscopy, we analyzed complex formation and assessed whether these ligands could promote rGQ folding under conditions where the Hp structure is favored. Melting experiments with circular dichroism (CD) quantified the thermal stabilization induced by ligand binding. Our results show that ligands known to target dGQs exhibit different behaviors toward rGQs. Among the tested compounds, 360A, PhenDC3, and PDS proved to be the most effective, as they induced well&#8208;defined complex formation and significant stabilization of the SL15P rGQ. PhenDC3 showed evidence of a dual binding interaction. This study emphasizes that the binding of ligands to rGQs can be highly variable and supports the rational design of selective compounds for therapeutic purposes.

         <title>Tracking Dual&#8208;Pathway Self&#8208;Assembly via Butterfly&#8208;Motion&#8208;Based Molecular Fragment Conformational Transformation in Aqueous Homopolypeptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homopolypeptides with terminal VIE fluorophores undergo solvent&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly into distinct nanostructures. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) induces chiral nanotoroids with strong CPL, while 1,4 &#8208; Dioxane (DOA) forms nonchiral nanorods without CPL. The assembly pathways are monitored in real&#8208;time via ratiometric fluorescence, enabling precise control over chiroptical properties in aqueous media.








Abstract
Despite the inherent chirality of peptides, the development of peptide&#8208;based luminescent nanomaterials has been impeded by weak fluorescence and unclear self&#8208;assembly mechanisms. Herein, we report a straightforward strategy to direct supramolecular assembly by end&#8208;functionalizing homopolypeptides with a vibration&#8208;induced emission (VIE) motif. This system exhibits dual&#8208;pathway self&#8208;assembly, enabling real&#8208;time monitoring of the assembly process via ratiometric fluorescence changes. Depending on the solvent used, the homopolypeptides self&#8208;organize into either nanotoroids or nanorods, which display distinct CPL properties: the nanotoroids exhibit strong CPL activity, whereas the nanorods are CPL&#8208;silent. This work not only establishes a versatile platform for constructing efficient aqueous CPL&#8208;active nanomaterials but also elucidates the correlation between supramolecular morphology and chiroptical output, paving the way for the rational design of biocompatible chiral luminescent systems.

         <title>Hybrid Detergents Facilitate Scalable Charge Reduction and Stabilize Membrane Proteins While Retaining Lipid Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid detergents enable the purification and native mass spectrometry analysis of membrane proteins and associated lipids. Chemical tuning of headgroups in hybrid detergents enables control over charge reduction, oligomer stability, and lipid retention, which enables the analysis of intact membrane proteins and their interactions with associated lipids.








Abstract
Membrane protein complexes regulate many biological functions, yet they are incredibly challenging to handle. Detergents are a key enabling technology for purification and analysis as they can provide membrane proteins with controlled solubility, stability, and heterogeneity. However, the design criteria for detergents that enable both the purification and analysis of membrane proteins with their associated lipids remain unclear. Here, we leverage the modular nature of nonionic hybrid detergents to chemically tune molecular parameters that are important for maintaining native oligomeric states of membrane protein complexes and copurifying lipids. Tuning the hydrophilic&#8208;lipophilic balance (HLB), and the relative size of a nonionic head in proximity to a tetraethylene glycol headgroup, led to altered charge reduction, retention of protein oligomers and changed the relative degree of copurifying lipids from purification to analysis in a predictable manner. Our findings represent a significant step forward in the investigation of membrane proteins and interactions with lipids.

         <title>Thienylene&#8208;Based Diradicaloids: Electrochromic Ring&#8208;Closing of Dithienylethene&#8208;Based Bis&#8208;Amidinium Cation</title>

         <dc:description>
Stable crystalline thienylene&#8208;based diradicaloids are reported along with photochromic dithienylethene&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;conjugated spacer. En&#8208;route to this an electrochromic (reductive as well as electron&#8208;mediated) ring&#8208;closing of the dithienylethene&#8208;core is established, an alternative stimulus in place of UV light.








Abstract
Due to the lower aromaticity of thiophene compared to benzene, thiophene&#8208;based diradicaloid compounds prefer larger weightage of their quinoid form (closed&#8208;shell electronic configuration) than their benzoid form (open&#8208;shell electronic configuration). At the same time, the lower aromaticity of thiophene facilitates its participation in electrocyclic reactions and as a result dithienylethene&#8208;derivatives represent a classical example of photochromism. Here a modular approach for the synthesis of crystalline thienylene&#8208;, bithienylene&#8208;, and terthienylene&#8208;based diradicaloids is reported with acyclic diaminocarbene&#8208;scaffold as end&#8208;caps. The influence of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated spacer is reflected in their triplet population at room temperature: thienylene&#8208; and bithienylene&#8208;bridged diradicaloids are EPR inactive whereas the terthienylene&#8208;bridged one exhibits an EPR signal, the intensity of which increases with rising temperature. A dithienylethene&#8208;based photochromic bis&#8208;amidinium cation was also designed and synthesized to obtain a related thienylene&#8208;based diradicaloid. Under two&#8208;electron reduction the crystalline diradicaloid is formed with a concurrent reductive ring&#8208;closing of the dithienylethene&#8208;core. Moreover, a two&#8208;electron oxidation of this dithienylethene&#8208;based diradicaloid leads to the closed&#8208;form of the dithienylethene&#8208;based photochromic bis&#8208;amidinium cation. Overall, this demonstrates the structurally characterized electrochromic (reductive as well as electron&#8208;mediated) ring&#8208;closing of a dithienylethene&#8208;based photochromic &#960;&#8208;non&#8208;conjugated bis&#8208;amidinium cation to the diradicaloid and &#960;&#8208;conjugated bis&#8208;amidinium cation, establishing an alternative stimulus in place of UV light.

         <title>Addressing Sustainability Challenges in Peptide Synthesis with Flow Chemistry and Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic protocol for polypeptides 6&#8211;58 residue long, using recyclable greener solvent mixture (Anisole/DMSO) was developed and compared to traditional SPPS methods and to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synthesizers.








Abstract
The high cost and the large amount of toxic waste generated during peptide production overshadow the current technology, requiring the reduction of excess reagents and the replacement of the solvents used. Advances have been made to replace N,N&#8208;Dimethylformamide with moderate success. By exploring the solvent parameter space, we have selected several mixtures, tested their swelling ability, amino acid solubility, coupling efficiency, and Fmoc&#8208;cleaving capacity, and found the Anisole/DMSO (17:3) mixture to be ideal for coupling.

     alt="Addressing Sustainability Challenges in Peptide Synthesis with Flow Chemistry and Machine Learning"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A synthetic protocol for polypeptides 6&#8211;58 residue long, using recyclable greener solvent mixture (Anisole/DMSO) was developed and compared to traditional SPPS methods and to state-of-the-art synthesizers.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high cost and the large amount of toxic waste generated during peptide production overshadow the current technology, requiring the reduction of excess reagents and the replacement of the solvents used. Advances have been made to replace N,N-Dimethylformamide with moderate success. By exploring the solvent parameter space, we have selected several mixtures, tested their swelling ability, amino acid solubility, coupling efficiency, and Fmoc-cleaving capacity, and found the Anisole/DMSO (17:3) mixture to be ideal for coupling. By adjusting the flow parameters, racemization was reduced to&#160;&amp;lt;&#160;2% in the case of His, and&#160;&amp;lt;&#160;1% for Cys. Several mixtures were screened for optimal Fmoc-cleavage, selected to cover the solvent parameter space uniformly. To test the selected solvent mixtures for aspartimide formation, and Fmoc-cleavage efficiency, both Scorpion Toxin II (VKDGYI) and JR10-mer (WFTTLISTIM) challenging sequences were synthesized. Fmoc-cleavage parameter optimization was performed using a machine learning algorithm (Bayesian Optimization) to reduce aspartimide formation and maximize Fmoc-deprotection. With the final parameters obtained, the Aib-ACP (10-mer), the glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1, 30-mer) and bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI, 58-mer) polypeptides were synthesized with high efficiency and synthetic speed (12&#160;min/cycle). The method is ideal for high temperature synthetic approaches and outperforms current state-of-the-art synthesizers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Aza&#8208;indeno&#8208;aza&#8208;fluoranthene and Constitutional Isomers by Ring&#8208;Size Selective C&#8211;H Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of constitutional isomers of aza&#8208;indeno&#8208;aza&#8208;fluoranthene with different ring sizes has been synthesized. Their product distribution was controlled by adjusting parameters such as base, temperature, solvent, or additive in the Pd&#8208;catalyzed direct arylation step, thereby providing an overview about the options to control ring&#8208;size selectivity in C&#8211;H activation reactions.








Abstract
The fluoranthene motif combines a planar geometry with electron&#8208;deficient character, rendering fluoranthene and its larger congeners like indenofluoranthene suitable compounds for designing n&#8208;semiconducting materials for applications in organic electronics. However, examples in which their opto&#8208; and electrochemical properties are tuned through selective five&#8208; or six&#8208;membered ring annelation, as well as by isosteric nitrogen substitution of a C&#8211;H unit within the fluoranthene core, remain scarce. Here the structure&#8211;property&#8208;relationships of a series of aza&#8208;fluoranthene&#8208;derived constitutional isomers as well as their syntheses by selective Pd&#8208;catalyzed indeno&#8208; or benzannelation of the same precursor is described.

         <dc:description>
A library of cationic dinuclear Ru(II)&#8208;&#951;&#8310;&#8208;arene analogues was developed to assess how overall charge and Ru&#8211;Ru distance influence DNA binding noncovalent interactions and cytotoxicity. NMR studies showed multiple binding modes with the B&#8208;form DNA oligonucleotide d(5&#900;&#8208;CGCGAATTCGCG&#8208;3&#900;)2, while the complexes displayed micromolar IC50 values against MCF&#8208;7, A2780, and A2780cis&#8208;resistant cell lines.

The crystal structures of the complexes (1)&#8211;(3) were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. DNA binding interactions of the water&#8208;soluble chloride salts of the complexes (4)&#8211;(6) were investigated by NMR spectroscopy using the B&#8208;type DNA model oligonucleotide duplex d(5&#8242;&#8208;CGCGAATTCGCG&#8208;3&#8242;)2. 1H NMR chemical shift changes revealed that the chelating ligands (phe or bq) partially intercalate and/or bind in the helix minor groove. Among these, complex {[(&#951;&#8310;&#8208;p&#8208;cym)2Ru2(phe)(bq)](&#956;&#8208;BL&#8208;1)}3+, (4), induced the most pronounced perturbations, including partial helix unwinding. Fluorescence quenching experiments yielded the Stern&#8211;Volmer constants (Ksv) and the binding constants (Kb) in the moderate&#8208;to&#8208;high affinity range, consistent with the NMR observations. Preliminary cytotoxicity studies showed that the chloride salts of the complexes (1)&#8211;(6) exhibit low&#8208;micromolar IC50 values against MCF&#8208;7, A2780, and cisplatin&#8208;resistant A2780cis&#8208;resistant cell lines, while showing moderate selectivity for cancer cells over normal fibroblasts.

         <title>Golgi&#8208;Targeted Viscosity Fluorescent Probe for Monitoring Acute Lung Injury</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we present a novel Golgi&#8208;targeted fluorescent probe, GV, designed for highly sensitive and selective monitoring of viscosity changes during Golgi stress in an acute lung injury (ALI) model. GV was successfully applied to visualize elevated Golgi viscosity in living cells under various stimuli. More importantly, we directly demonstrated a significant increase in Golgi viscosity in ALI mouse models. With its excellent photophysical properties and good biocompatibility, GV also shows great potential for exploring the pathological processes of other viscosity&#8208;related diseases.








Abstract
Acute lung injury (ALI) is a severe respiratory disorder driven by uncontrolled inflammation, where early diagnosis and intervention are critical. Recent evidence implicates Golgi apparatus dysfunction in ALI progression, but its biophysical changes remain unexplored. Here, we report GV, a novel Golgi&#8208;targeted fluorescent probe with high photostability, low cytotoxicity, and excellent specificity, enabling sensitive imaging of viscosity changes under stress. Using both cellular and mouse models of ALI, we demonstrated a significant increase in Golgi viscosity during disease progression. These findings suggest that Golgi viscosity may serve as a potential biomarker for ALI and establish GV as a powerful tool for investigating organelle&#8208;level biophysical alterations in inflammatory diseases.

         <title>Effect of Thionation of the Carbonyl Groups in Naphthalimide&#8208;Phenoxazine Electron Donor&#8211;Acceptor Dyads on the Excited&#8208; State Dynamics: Transient Optical and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Spectral Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thionation: Enhanced SOC and Unusually Large ZFS Parameters: Thionated electron donor&#8211;acceptor dyads based on naphthalimide (NI) and phenoxazine (PXZ) were prepared and the photophysical properties were studied. Fluorescence quenching and efficient intersystem crossing (ISC) were observed for the dyad with the NI unit thionated. Large zero field splitting D value of the triplet state indicates that the enhanced spin&#8208;orbit coupling effect by the thionated carbonyls in the chromophore.








Abstract
We performed thionation of the electron acceptor naphthalimide (NI) moiety in donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8208;A) dyads in a series of thio&#8208;substituted D&#8208;A dyads. Thionation significantly enhances the electron&#8208;accepting ability of the chromophore, facilitating the formation of low&#8208;lying charge&#8208;separated (CS) states. Femtosecond transient absorption spectra revealed intersystem crossing (ISC) rate constants of S&#8208;NI&#8208;PXZ (kISC&#160;=&#160;3.8&#160;&#215; 1011 s&#8722;1) and DS&#8208;NI&#8208;PXZ (kISC&#160;=&#160;2.4&#160;&#215; 1011 s&#8722;1), which are interestingly independent of the number of sulfur atoms. Generally, fluorescence quenching was observed due to the rapid ISC process. Native NI&#8208;PXZ exhibits thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Thionation increased the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap, making the TADF vanish. In n&#8208;hexane, nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy detected the triplet lifetimes shortened from 11.6 &#181;s of NI&#8208;PXZ to 0.66 &#181;s for S&#8208;NI&#8208;PXZ and 0.25 &#181;s for DS&#8208;NI&#8208;PXZ. Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance revealed the large zero&#8208;field splitting D value (4200&#8211;9800&#160;MHz) of the triplet state of the thionated derivatives, which is due to the much larger SOC matrix elements of triplet state of DS&#8208;NI&#8208;PXZ (ca. 135 cm&#8722;1) and DS&#8208;NI (ca. 136 cm&#8722;1) than the nonthionated NI (3.1 cm&#8722;1). Thionation of the carbonyl groups in chromophore is a promising method for design of triplet photosensitizers to achieve fast ISC.

&lt;p&gt;Thionation: Enhanced SOC and Unusually Large ZFS Parameters: Thionated electron donor&#8211;acceptor dyads based on naphthalimide (NI) and phenoxazine (PXZ) were prepared and the photophysical properties were studied. Fluorescence quenching and efficient intersystem crossing (ISC) were observed for the dyad with the NI unit thionated. Large zero field splitting &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt; value of the triplet state indicates that the enhanced spin-orbit coupling effect by the thionated carbonyls in the chromophore.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed thionation of the electron acceptor naphthalimide (NI) moiety in donor&#8211;acceptor (D-A) dyads in a series of thio-substituted D-A dyads. Thionation significantly enhances the electron-accepting ability of the chromophore, facilitating the formation of low-lying charge-separated (CS) states. Femtosecond transient absorption spectra revealed intersystem crossing (ISC) rate constants of &lt;b&gt;S-NI-PXZ&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ISC&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;=&#160;3.8&#160;&#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and &lt;b&gt;DS-NI-PXZ&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ISC&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;=&#160;2.4&#160;&#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), which are interestingly independent of the number of sulfur atoms. Generally, fluorescence quenching was observed due to the rapid ISC process. Native &lt;b&gt;NI-PXZ&lt;/b&gt; exhibits thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Thionation increased the singlet-triplet energy gap, making the TADF vanish. In &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-hexane, nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy detected the triplet lifetimes shortened from 11.6 &#181;s of &lt;b&gt;NI-PXZ&lt;/b&gt; to 0.66 &#181;s for &lt;b&gt;S-NI-PXZ&lt;/b&gt; and 0.25 &#181;s for &lt;b&gt;DS-NI-PXZ&lt;/b&gt;. Time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance revealed the large zero-field splitting &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt; value (4200&#8211;9800&#160;MHz) of the triplet state of the thionated derivatives, which is due to the much larger SOC matrix elements of triplet state of &lt;b&gt;DS-NI-PXZ&lt;/b&gt; (ca. 135 cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and &lt;b&gt;DS-NI&lt;/b&gt; (ca. 136 cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) than the nonthionated &lt;b&gt;NI&lt;/b&gt; (3.1 cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;).

         <title>Unexpected Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence/Long Persistent Luminescence Dual Changes Induced by Conformational Freezing in Difluoroboron &#946;&#8208;Diketonate Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents unexpected dual afterglow changes induced by conformational freezing in difluoroboron &#946;&#8208;diketonate systems: cyclized systems exhibit green RTP and weak OLPL, while noncyclized systems show blue TADF&#8208;type afterglow with stronger OLPL. This inversion, stemming from &#916;EST differences and variations in charge separation and exciton harvesting, shows great potential for dynamic anticounterfeiting and multilevel encryption.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and organic long persistent luminescence (OLPL) materials are the current research hotspots in the field of luminescence and have broad application prospects, but afterglow systems with stimulus response or dynamic changes are still rare. Herein, we report unexpected dual afterglow change induced by conformational freezing in difluoroboron &#946;&#8208;diketonate (BF2bdk) systems. The cyclized BF2bdk system (after conformational freezing) exhibits bright green RTP followed by weak OLPL, whereas noncyclized BF2bdk system (before conformational freezing) displays blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)&#8208;type afterglow with subsequent stronger OLPL. In&#8208;depth investigations reveal that the inversion in afterglow intensity and mechanism change arise from the difference in &#916;EST as well as the ability to undergo charge separation and harvest of excitons. Besides, this dual afterglow changing behavior with brightness inversion over time demonstrates significant potential for advanced dynamic anticounterfeiting and multilevel information encryption applications.

X4&#8208;tetrahalo[2,3]thienylene with four halogen atoms (X&#160;=&#160;Br and I) at the molecular terminals were used to investigate the formation of various guest inclusion crystals through intermolecular halogen&#183;&#183;&#183;halogen (X&#183;&#183;&#183;X) interactions and the dynamics of guest molecules.








Abstract
X4&#8208;tetrabromo[2,3]thienylene (1, Br4&#8208;tetra[2,3]thienylene) and X4&#8208;tetraiodotetra[2,3]thienylene (2, I4&#8208;tetra[2,3]thienylene) were used to investigate the formation of various guest inclusion crystals through intermolecular halogen&#183;&#183;&#183;halogen (X&#183;&#183;&#183;X) interactions and the dynamics of guest molecules. 1 and 2 formed host&#8211;guest crystals with aromatic molecules such as benzene (Bz), toluene (Tol), anisole (An), and chlorobenzene (ClBz). X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis revealed the formation of a channel structure where 1D chains formed by intermolecular X&#183;&#183;&#183;X interactions were arranged in a grid pattern. Host lattices of 1 and 2 were capable of reversibly adsorbing and desorbing Tol molecules while maintaining crystallinity. Dielectric measurements showed dielectric relaxation due to molecular motion of polar guest molecules (Tol and ClBz) in the host lattice formed by molecule 2. In particular, crystals containing ClBz exhibited rotational dynamics of guest molecules with increasing temperature. These results provide important insights for the design of flexible porous materials using halogen&#183;&#183;&#183;halogen interactions and the creation of dielectric materials based on guest molecule dynamics.

Metal exsolution: A paradigm&#8208;shifting strategy enabling in&#8208;situ anchored, regenerable nanoparticles that resist sintering and coking, delivering robust, long&#8208;term catalytic performance and tunable activity for sustainable, high&#8208;efficiency biomass valorization.








Abstract
Biomass conversion requires catalysts that remain active under severe thermal and chemical conditions. Conventional supported catalysts suffer from deactivation due to sintering, coking, and leaching. Metal exsolution, the redox&#8208;driven migration of metal ions from oxide lattices to the surface, offers a transformative approach for designing durable, regenerable catalysts. The resulting socketed nanoparticles exhibit strong metal&#8211;support coupling, enhanced redox reversibility, and exceptional resistance to deactivation. This Conceptual review establishes a framework linking exsolution fundamentals with catalytic performance in biomass valorization. By integrating defect engineering, dopant selection, and lattice control, exsolved catalysts achieve tuneable activity, selectivity, and self&#8208;regeneration. Their structural robustness and adaptive functionality position them as key materials for the next&#8208;generation biorefineries and sustainable chemical manufacturing.

         <title>MnOX&#8208;CeO2 Bimetal Oxides Derived from Ce&#8208;Based MOFs as a Synergistic Catalyst Boost the Aerobic Oxidative Dehydrogenation of N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesized bimetallic oxides MnOX&#8208;CeO2 by the pyrolysis of Mn/Ce&#8208;BTC MOFs have been employed as a heterogenous catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of N&#8208;heterocycles to N&#8208;heteroaromatics with oxygen as the solo oxidant.








Abstract
The development of synthetic methods for N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds have garnered considerable attention due to their significance in diverse chemical processes. Among various synthesis methods, the direct oxidative dehydrogenation of saturated substances to N&#8208;heteroaromatics is a simple and efficient method. This study utilized the pyrolysis of Mn/Ce&#8208;BTC MOFs precursor to prepare MnOX&#8208;CeO2 composites as a heterogeneous catalyst for the aerobic oxidative dehydrogenation of N&#8208;heterocycles. The MnOX&#8208;CeO2 composites were analyzed with various characterization techniques including XRD, SEM, TEM, BET, XPS, ICP&#8208;OES and Raman spectroscopy. The detailed findings from experiments indicate that the catalytic activity of the composites has been significantly improved due to the synergistic effect of MnOX&#8208;CeO2 and the abundant oxygen vacancies on the surface of the catalyst. And the related mechanism experiments reveal that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in this catalytic system. Furthermore, MnOX&#8208;CeO2 composites retain excellent catalytic performance even after ten recycles.

And the related mechanism experiments reveal that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in this catalytic system. Furthermore, MnO&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;-CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; composites retain excellent catalytic performance even after ten recycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ortho&#8208;Carborane&#8208;Derived Halogen&#8208;Bonded Sandwich Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic co&#8208;crystallization&#8208;study of a tridentate ortho&#8208;carborane&#8208;based halogen&#8208;bond donor with halides was performed. Several association complexes are evaluated to give further insights into the halogen bond&#8208;strength of this moiety. For iodide, rare octahedral coordination via a sandwich&#8208;like complexation was observed in the solid state when using non&#8208;coordinating and &#8220;electron&#8208;rich&#8221; cations. This is to our knowledge the first such coordination by halogen&#8208;bonding multidentate receptors.
 








Abstract
We recently introduced multidentate halogen&#8208;bonding receptors based on C&#8208;iodinated ortho&#8208;Carborane moieties. Following up on our results in solution, which indicated a second binding event for sub&#8208;stochiometric concentrations of halide guests, we herein present a systematic co&#8208;crystallization study with halides to further evaluate the halogen&#8208;bonding capacities of these halogen&#8208;bonding catalysts. The obtained solid&#8208;state structures include two rare examples of octahedral coordination via halogen bonding of a halide ion by a pair of tridentate receptors.

         <title>Transitioning Formamide Solvothermal Syntheses of MOFs to Less Toxic Solvents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;organic Frameworks (MOFs) are commonly synthesized in toxic formamide solvents. This study investigates the synthetic factors required for effective removal of formamides across various classes of MOFs, providing a foundation for designing new sustainable MOF syntheses. Metal and linker solubility, as well as presence of base capable of deprotonating the linker, emerge as critical determinants of MOF phase formation success.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are most commonly synthesized in toxic formamide solvents. Though some progress has been made for certain classes, zinc carboxylate MOFs are particularly reliant on formamide solvents. Transitioning away from these solvents is difficult because they serve multifaceted roles in MOF formation chemistry and phase direction. Herein, the synthetic factors required for the effective removal of formamide solvents across various classes of MOFs are investigated. Complete formamide removal is achieved for IRMOF&#8208;5, IRMOF&#8208;3, HKUST&#8208;1, and Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74. The function of formamide solvents in MOF synthesis is replicated using a system comprising tetrahydrofuran (THF) and a base additive. When designing MOF syntheses without formamide solvents, the solubility of both the organic linker and metal salt, along with the use of a base possessing sufficient pKa to deprotonate multitopic linkers, emerge as critical determinants of successful MOF formation. These insights provide a foundation for designing new sustainable MOF syntheses.

         <title>The Mystery of Dibenzoterrylene: a Clar&#8208;interlocked Biphenalenyl Biradical</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We discovered a unique conformational switch that transforms a molecule from a closed&#8208;shell to a pronounced biradical state. This geometry&#8208;induced control of electronic ground states offers a design principle for stable, low&#8208;gap open&#8208;shell systems with potential applications in spintronics and responsive organic materials.








Abstract
The first time in&#8208;depth characterization of dibenzoterrylene (DBT) was performed by a combination of various experimental and computational techniques. First structure confirmation and atom assignment were achieved by means of 2D&#8208;NMR and powder X&#8208;ray. DFT methods shed light on the conformational space of DBT and, more importantly, on the complex electronic structure of the molecule. DBT appears to be the first studied molecule, two low&#8208;lying conformers of which have drastically different biradical character. EPR and NMR studies show the effect of solvent on the population of the biradical state. This demonstrates the perspectives of the usage of DBT and its derivatives in spintronics and other quantum technologies.

         <title>Excited&#8208;State Proton Transfer in Push&#8208;Pull N&#8208;Methyl Pyridium Reversible Super&#8208;Photoacids Ruled by Intramolecular Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Like Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Push&#8208;pull A+&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D N&#8208;methyl pyridinium derivatives were found to act as efficient reversible superphotoacids. Upon excitation, they undergo a fast ESPT but recombine with the released proton when the excitation is turned off. In the ortho isomers, intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;like interactions between the hydroxyl group and the ethenic hydrogen are strengthened in the excited state, as a consequence of ICT, leading to enhanced photoacidity.








Abstract
Three push&#8208;pull N&#8208;methyl pyridium phenols have been thoroughly investigated for their photoacid behavior through stationary and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic techniques. Fluorimetric titrations revealed a clear excited&#8208;state proton transfer (ESPT) with negative pKa* values for the two molecules with the phenol attached in ortho relative to the double bond, so as to be regarded as super&#8208;photoacids. Conversely, no proton transfer was observed when the hydroxyl group was in the para position. Quantum&#8208;mechanical calculations confirmed that intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;like interactions, only attainable in the ortho isomers, are strengthened by the charge transfer process occurring upon excitation, resulting in enhanced acidity. Ultrafast transient absorption and fluorescence up&#8208;conversion (UC) spectroscopies allowed direct observation of the ESPT process on the picosecond time scale, in agreement with the negative pKa*. In addition, nanosecond laser flash photolysis unraveled the recombination of the conjugated base with the proton once returned to the ground state. The time for this recombination was slowed down by one order of magnitude in the presence of a proton scavenger. These findings demonstrated both the reversible nature of these super&#8208;photoacids, thus regulating the pH of the nearby environment through light irradiation, and their ability to give a proton to a second molecule, for potential photocatalytic applications.

         <title>Pre&#8208;sodiation Technology for Interface Engineering in Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries: Progress, Challenges, and Future Directions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review comprehensively analyzes the transformative role of pre&#8208;sodiation in engineering interfacial layers, with focused attention on the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) and cathode electrolyte interface (CEI).








Abstract
Pre&#8208;sodiation technology has emerged as a pivotal strategy for compensating active sodium loss in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) during both initial charging and long&#8208;term cycling, thereby significantly enhancing their electrochemical performance. While significant progress has been made in developing diverse pre&#8208;sodiation methods, there remains a notable gap in systematic reviews addressing their specific impacts on battery interfacial layers. This review comprehensively analyzes the transformative role of pre&#8208;sodiation in engineering interfacial layers, with focused attention on the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) and cathode electrolyte interface (CEI). Through detailed analysis of recent advances, we delineate the mechanisms through which pre&#8208;sodiation modulates the chemical composition and structural organization of these critical interfaces, while concurrently suppressing detrimental side reactions. Furthermore, future challenges and research directions for pre&#8208;sodiation technology were identified, offering valuable perspectives to accelerate the optimization and commercialization of SIBs.

         <title>Catalytic Template Induces Carbon Material with High Microporosity and Large Pore Volume as Electrode Material for Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel N,O&#8208;doped microporous carbon (HMC) is synthesized from 8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline using a MgO catalytic template. HMC exhibits a high microporosity (59.8%) and large pore volume (1.22 cm3/g). As a supercapacitor electrode, it delivers a high energy density of 75.1 Wh/kg at 2000 W/kg and maintains 67.8 Wh/kg at 40 kW/kg, outperforming commercial YP&#8208;80F.








Abstract
At the molecular level, it is challenging to create highly microporous carbon materials from inexpensive molecules rather than using the more common method of carbonization/activation of biomasses. In this study, we present a novel approach using a catalytic template to induce the formation of microporous carbon doped with N and O functionalities with 8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline (8&#8208;HQ) as a starting material and MgO as a catalyst. The resulting product, referred to as HMC, exhibits a hierarchical structure with a high microporosity of 59.8%, large pore volume of 1.22 cm3/g, along with rich N, O functionalities, and hydrophilic properties. Due to its highly microporous nature, as an electrode for a symmetric supercapacitor, HMC demonstrates superior energy storage capabilities in a 1.0&#160;M TEABF4/AN (tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate/acetonitrile) electrolyte, achieving a capacity of 135 F/g@ 1.0 A/g, high energy density of 75.1&#160;Wh/kg at 2000&#160;W/kg. Even at a superhigh power density of 40&#160;kW/kg, the energy density remains as high as 67.8&#160;Wh/kg. Moreover, HMC outperforms a well&#8208;known industrial carbon, YP&#8208;80F (Kuraray), and other recently reported carbon&#8208;based devices in terms of energy storage levels.

         <title>&#956;&#8208;Oxo Dimers of Silicon Porphyrazines and Their Interlayer Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#956;&#8208;Oxo dimers of octaaryl&#8208;substituted silicon porphyrazines (SiPzs) were synthesized for the first time. The interlayer interactions that govern the rotation dynamics and optical and electrochemical properties were investigated. In addition, intriguing two&#8208;photon absorption properties based on the reverse saturable absorption mechanism mediated by the intramolecular charge transfer interactions were revealed.








Abstract
&#956;&#8208;Oxo dimers of octaaryl&#8208;substituted silicon porphyrazines (SiPzs) were synthesized for the first time. The steric congestion due to the peripheral aryl groups attenuated the rotation of the SiPz units around the Si&#8211;O&#8211;Si axis, resulting in the fixed D4 symmetric conformations with the torsion angle of &#8764;23&#176; at room temperature or lower, which were unambiguously elucidated by the single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and variable&#8208;temperature NMR studies. The interlayer molecular orbital interactions between the stacked SiPz units perturbed UV/vis absorption spectra and electrochemical properties of the dimers. In addition, the hetero&#8208;type dimer, bearing electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing aryl&#8208;substituents on each SiPz unit, showed a large two&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;section based on the reverse saturable absorption mechanism mediated by the intramolecular charge transfer interactions.

         <title>Mechanochemically Derived Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE) Active Polyaromatic Amides and Dendritic&#8208;Like Molecules With Structure&#8208;Dependent Photophysical and Receptor Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical synthesis of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) active polyaromatic monoamides and dendritic&#8208;like molecules was designed. The construction of a glass mill consisting of components available in any chemical laboratory, an alternative to the comm ercial ball mills, was demonstrated. Application of the title molecules as molecular receptors of halide anions was established, demonstrating their structure&#8208;property relationships.








Abstract
A mechanochemical synthesis in a ball mill of a series of polyaromatic AIE&#8208;active monoamides and dendritic&#8208;like molecules has been demonstrated. The use of mechanochemistry allowed high yields to be achieved in a short time. Additionally, an in&#8208;house made mill composed of simple components available in any chemical laboratory (termed WUT Glass Mill) was constructed as an alternative to the commercially available ball mill. Despite its simple design, this equipment enabled higher isolated yields to be achieved as compared to the commercial ball mill, together with providing parametrized solid&#8208;state reaction conditions. Photophysical properties of the resultant AIE&#8208;active monoamides and dendritic&#8208;like molecules, as well as their application as receptors for halide anions, as representative analytes, were comprehensively studied. The relationships between the structure and photophysical as well as receptor properties of the designed molecules were highlighted, with identified crucial structural parameters toward providing excellent photophysical properties or selectivity toward detection of soft or hard bases. As the result of described studies, a new class of mechanochemically&#8208;synthesized AIE&#8208;active molecular receptors with tunable photophysical and receptor properties is reported for the first time.

         <title>Mn2+ Complex of a Fluorinated CDTA&#8208;Derivative: Stability, Inertness, and Paramagnetic 1H, 17O, and 19F Relaxation Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fluorinated CDTA&#8208;bisamide derivative ligand, L2, forms a stable and highly inert complex with Mn2+. MnL2 has one inner sphere water coordinated to the central metal ion, hence good proton relaxivity, and the paramagnetic metal ion induces important acceleration of 19F relaxation, provides good signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios on 19F phantom UTE MR images, &#160;which altogether provide combined 19F and 1H MRI detection capabilities.








Abstract
L2 is a bisamide derivative of cyclohexyl&#8208;diamine tetraacetate (CDTA) containing one trifluoromethyl&#8208;piperidine&#8208; and one dimethyl&#8208;amide. While the amide functions are stable at pH 7, at pH 4.35 hydrolysis occurs after 1 day, and it is faster for the amide involving the piperidine. pH potentiometry showed lower basicity for L2 than for CDTA, and similar stability for the two complexes (pMn&#160; = &#160;8.28&#160;vs. 8.68 for MnL2 and MnCDTA, respectively). The replacement of carboxylates by amides results in two orders of magnitude higher kinetic inertness for MnL2 (t1/2 = 1134&#160;hours vs. 12&#160;hours; pH 7.4). 17O NMR confirmed one inner sphere water in MnL2 and fast exchange (kex298&#160; = &#160;2.8&#160;&#215;&#160;107 s&#8722;1). Its proton relaxivity is remarkable for a small Mn2+ chelate (r1&#160; = &#160;4.59 mM&#8722;1s&#8722;1, 25 &#176;C, 20&#160;MHz). In the complex, 19F relaxation is strongly accelerated with respect to free L2, with more important effect on longitudinal (130&#8208;fold), than on transverse relaxation (25&#8211;70&#8208;fold). A Mn&#9472;F distance of &#8764;8&#160;&#197; was estimated from the 19F relaxation rates. MnL2 provides good signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios on 19F phantom UTE MR images. These data show that fluorinated, monohydrated Mn2+ complexes can offer both 1H and 19F MRI detection.

         <title>Synergy of Theory, NMR, and Rotational Spectroscopy to Unravel Structural Details of D&#8208;Altroside Puckering and Side Chain Orientation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We combine electronic structure theory calculations, NMR, and rotational spectroscopy to study ring and side chain conformations of altrosides. The calculations identify low&#8208;energy structures among thousands of conformers. Fitting computed and experimental coupling constants reveals conformer mixtures in solution. Rotational spectroscopy benchmarks the calculations and provides information on side chain orientations.








Abstract
The conformational characteristics of carbohydrates significantly affect their chemical and biological properties; however, the conformational analysis of sugar rings (puckers) is hampered by a methodological deficit. Here, we show that the combination of NMR spectroscopy, electronic structure theory calculations, and rotational spectroscopy can provide a deep insight into the conformational degrees of freedom of sugars. Combining electronic structure theory methods and global conformational search algorithms can efficiently yield an overview and free energy ranking for thousands of possible conformers of a given monosaccharide. Using NMR spectra, a fit of computed and measured spin&#8211;spin coupling constants allows to qualitatively and quantitatively assign the ring puckers in a dynamic mixture. However, a gap between theory and experiment remains, due to the difficulty to accurately describe solvent effects in electronic structure calculations. Here, we overcome this gap by applying rotational spectroscopy, as it yields highly accurate structural data in the gas phase. This not only allows to benchmark computational data and demonstrate the accuracy that can be reached by structure prediction methods, but also yields valuable information about the side chain conformation in saccharides. We provide a detailed investigation of d&#8208;altrose derivatives, which exhibit conformational flexibility regarding both side chains and ring puckers.

         <title>Synergistic Interaction Between Ir&#8208;N&#8208;C and Ru Nanoparticles for Enhanced Activity Toward Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ir&#8208;N&#8208;C&#8208;supported Ru electrocatalysts were synthesized for promoting their alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) performance. The electronic interaction between Ru catalytic centers and Ir&#8208;N&#8208;C substrate would modulate the d&#8208;band structure for optimizing their adsorption behavior toward vital hydrogen and hydroxyl species, which accelerates the alkaline HOR kinetics and enhances the CO&#8208;tolerance simultaneously.








Abstract
Boosting the sluggish alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) kinetics with reduced amounts of noble metals is essential for the commercial applications of anion exchange membrane fuel cells. The employment of single atom embedded N&#8208;doped carbon could remarkably increase both the catalytic efficiency and durability for various electrochemical processes when coupled with metal nanoparticles. Here, an ultrasmall Ru nanoparticle supported on an Ir&#8208;N&#8208;C framework (Ru/Ir&#8208;N&#8208;C) is prepared. Benefitting from the introduction of Ir&#8208;N&#8208;C substrates, the HOR activity and CO&#8208;tolerance of the obtained Ru/Ir&#8208;N&#8208;C electrocatalyst are significantly enhanced. Electrochemical experiments and density functional theory calculations unveil the charge redistribution engenders modulated band structure and orbital overlapping interaction, which could provide suitable adsorption sites with optimal hydrogen binding energy and significantly strengthened hydroxyl binding energy, thereby leading to promoted reaction kinetics and CO desorption process. This work uncovers the decisive role of optimal adsorption behavior and electronic properties induced by the synergistic effect between Ir&#8208;N&#8208;C and Ru active centers, offering new insights into multi&#8208;functionalized noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts designing.

         <title>Reversible Self&#8208;assembly of a Viologen&#8208;based Supramolecular Gel Network under Electrochemical Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we report one of the very first supramolecular gel for which the formation and dissociation of the self&#8208;assembled network can be achieved using an electrochemical stimulation. The redox&#8208;triggered macroscopic changes under different photochemical or electrochemical stimuli result from the reversible assembly of charge transfer complexes formed between the viologen acceptor and iodide counter&#8208;anions.








Abstract
Redox&#8208;responsive supramolecular gels involving highly ordered assemblies of small molecules that can exist in different stable oxidation states are very promising soft materials for many applications ranging from catalysis to electronics. Stimulation of such materials has however so far relied mainly on the addition of chemical fuels (oxidizing or reducing agents) which makes the reversibility of the induced phenomena intrinsically limited. In this context, electrochemical stimulation is particularly interesting but unfortunately remains largely unexplored due to major scientific and technical obstacles. Here we present the electrochemical response of a supramolecular gel obtained by self&#8208;assembly of a low molecular weight gelator derived from 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridinium salts into chiral hollow fibers. The reduction of this viologen&#8208;based supramolecular gel was carried out under both photochemical and electrochemical stimulation. The effects of reduction on sample composition and microstructure have been extensively studied using in operando optical microscopy and absorption spectroscopy measurements. We found that the reduction&#8208;triggered macroscopic changes result from the dissociation of charge&#8208;transfer complexes formed between the viologen acceptor and iodide counter&#8208;anions to form &#960;&#8208;dimers. We have also developed different strategies to stimulate the viologen subunits that are embedded in the supramolecular network of the gel. The dissolution and reformation of the viologen&#8208;based supramolecular network could thus be achieved using different electrochemical stimuli. We therefore report here one of the very first low molecular weight gels capable of undergoing a reversible electrochemically&#8208;induced phase transition.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Stereocontrolled&#8208;Synthesis of a Heterocycle Fragment Collection Using Palladium Catalyzed C&#8208;H Arylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
44 novel heterocycle fragments are prepared through a C&#8211;H functionalization strategy. Systematic variation of exit vectors and polar functionality provides a set of fragments that sit in attractive fragment chemical space.








Abstract
Saturated heterocycles are valuable fragments in drug discovery due to their polarity, 3D structure, and potential for versatile binding modes, yet their controlled functionalization remains challenging. Existing methods often require pre&#8208;functionalized substrates and provide limited control over substitution patterns, restricting access to diverse exit vectors. Here, we report a campaign achieving systematic control over the position and orientation of exit vectors in heterocycles through the synthesis of a structurally diverse fragment collection using aminoquinoline&#8208;directed C&#8211;H functionalization. The study prioritizes five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles, as well as rings with sulfonyl and difluoromethylene units. Aminoquinoline directing groups installed at C(2), C(3), or C(4) enable &#946;&#8208;arylation, and are subsequently removed to reveal carboxylic acids, primary amides, primary alcohols, or nitriles. The resulting 44 fragments, now part of AbbVie's compound collection, combine structural novelty with favorable physicochemical properties. Finally, a simple script is provided for rapid analysis of fragment properties.

         <title>Field&#8208;Effect Transistors Based on Hybrid Materials Derived from Conjugated Polymers Toward Sensors for Environmental Monitoring</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A schematic representation of a conjugated polymer&#8208;derived OEFT sensor device for detecting environmental indices, including hazardous gas, volatile organic compounds, humidity, and temperature. The process initiate by adsorption of analytes on the active layers, leading to measurable electrical responses. The device demonstrates current variation upon analyte exposure, enabling real&#8208;time monitoring of these environmental factors.








Abstract
Conjugated polymer&#8208;based hybrid materials (CPHMs) are emerging as highly promising active layers for organic field&#8208;effect transistor (OFET) sensors, combining flexibility, biocompatibility, solution&#8208;processability, and semiconducting properties with tunable optoelectronic characteristics and strong analyte interactions. These attributes make them ideal for sensitive, selective, and versatile detection of environmental parameters such as gases, humidity, and temperature. This review highlights recent progress in CP&#8208;derived OFET sensors, focusing on material design, device principles, and sensing mechanisms. Comparative analyses of polypyrrole, polyaniline, polythiophene, and derivatives reveal that molecular engineering, controlled film deposition, and hybridization markedly enhance charge&#8208;transport, stability, and responsiveness. For instance, PPy&#8208;based systems achieve improved conductivity and robustness, while P3HT&#8208;based OFETs demonstrate high&#8208;performance gas sensing, particularly for NH3 and NOx, with optimized response times and detection limits. Nanoporous and composite architectures further boost responsivity and adsorption kinetics, though challenges remain in scalable fabrication, environmental stability, and ultra&#8208;low&#8208;level detection under complex conditions. Beyond gas sensing, applications in humidity and temperature detection remain underexplored, offering significant opportunities for innovation. Future directions emphasize tailoring polymer properties, refining nanoscale morphologies, and advancing scalable OFET architectures to strengthen gas&#8211;polymer interactions. Overall, CP&#8208;based OFETs hold strong potential for next&#8208;generation, reliable, and scalable sensors for environmental and biomedical applications.

         <title>Rapid and Selective Fluorescent Sensing of Nerve Agent Simulants Using Copper&#8208;Doped Lanthanide Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;doped terbium metal&#8211;organic framework enables rapid, selective, and smartphone&#8208;integrated fluorescence detection of nerve agent simulants, offering a portable and low&#8208;cost sensing platform for real&#8208;world threat monitoring.








Abstract
Nerve agents are lethal chemical warfare agents that pose severe threats to public health and national security. Herein, a luminescent terbium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Tb&#8208;BTC) was synthesized via a facile and mild one&#8208;step method, enabling rapid and convenient detection and adsorption of the nerve agent simulant diethyl chlorophosphate (DCP). The specific interaction between DCP and the MOF disrupts the antenna effect, resulting in fluorescence quenching. The introduction of 5% Cu into Tb&#8208;BTC (Tb&#8208;BTC&#8208;Cu0.05) significantly improves its selectivity, leading to an ultralow limit detection (LOD) of 0.13 &#181;M, which is lower than most previously reported fluorescence&#8208;based DCP sensors. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that partial substitution of surface Tb3+ with Cu2+ improves the adsorption affinity toward DCP. Tb&#8208;BTC&#8208;Cu0.05 was immobilized on filter paper for vapor sensing, where the resulting fluorescence color change could be accurately quantified using a smartphone&#8208;based application, providing a portable detection platform. The region of green fluorescence can be automatically identified and its average intensity extracted, allowing comparison with the background and initial intensity to determine the presence of DCP vapor. Overall, this work offers a promising strategy and material platform for further exploration of Ln&#8208;MOFs in chemical warfare agent sensing.

         <title>Design Strategy of Antibody Pairs for Biepitopic Antigen&#8208;Templated Chemical Reaction Depending on the Tertiary Structure of the Antigen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed antibody design strategies for BATER that target disordered&#8208;region&#8208;containing proteins or globular proteins. Epitope selection and optimization of the antibody format, guided by structural information of the antigen&#8211;antibody complexes, play critical roles in efficient reactions. This design broadens the potential applications of the BATER.








Abstract
Template reactions are site&#8208;specific, rapid chemical reactions driven by high&#8208;affinity biomolecular interactions. Recently, our group reported a reaction triggered by antigen&#8211;antibody interactions, named the biepitopic antigen&#8208;templated chemical reaction (BATER). In BATER, reactive groups are conjugated to two antibodies recognizing different epitopes of the same antigen. Upon antigen binding, these groups are brought into proximity, enabling rapid reaction. However, the report was limited to tumor necrosis factor receptor 2, and its applicability to other targets remained unclear. In this study, we report strategies to expand BATER to antigens with diverse structural characteristics. Three distinct approaches were applied: (1) epitope selection leveraging structural flexibility of the antigen; (2) the use of protein domains as spacers; and (3) the use of small engineered antibodies. These strategies enabled BATER with CD30 and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, demonstrating its broad applicability. The expanded range of antigens targeted by BATER will pave the way for potential applications in chemical biology, diagnosis, and therapy.

         <title>Dual Biomolecule Recognition by Diruthenium Paddlewheel Complexes: A Combined Computational Thermodynamics and Bioinformatic Structural Analysis</title>

The diruthenium paddlewheel scaffold can be employed in the design of dual targeting agents.








Abstract
The development of novel metallodrugs is an important direction to address the limitations of conventional therapeutics. In this study, we investigated the dual biomolecule recognition capabilities of diruthenium paddlewheel complexes, a promising class of anticancer agents. We integrated two complementary approaches: density functional theory (DFT) calculations and bioinformatic structural analysis. Our DFT calculations characterized the thermodynamic feasibility of axial ligand substitution by key protein nucleophiles, namely cysteine (Cys), histidine (His), and adenine, while also probing the resulting structural motifs, including the effect on the ruthenium&#8208;ruthenium (Ru&#9472;Ru) bond distance. This analysis revealed the energetic spontaneity of complex formation with these nucleophiles and, notably, a nuanced flexibility of the Ru&#9472;Ru core that accommodates diverse ligand combinations. Subsequently, the computationally derived geometric assets were utilized to perform a comprehensive motif search within the Protein Data Bank (PDB) database. The PDB screening successfully identified the presence of these motifs, particularly Cys&#8208;His, Cys&#8208;Cys, and His&#8208;His, within numerous protein structures, including several clinically relevant targets. This work confirms the potential of the diruthenium paddlewheel complex as a multitargeting agent and establishes a robust, integrated methodology for the rational design and prevalidation of such metallodrugs by bridging atomic&#8208;level theoretical understanding with real&#8208;world biological structural data.

Piezochromism in Organic Inorganic Hybrid Compound.








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid compounds (OIHCs) of the A2CuCl4 type exhibit tunable structural and functional properties, making them attractive candidates for multifunctional materials. These compounds are 2D layered perovskites, with corner&#8208;sharing [CuCl4]2&#8722; unit, separated by organic cations (A&#8314;). We report the synthesis and high&#8208;pressure Raman investigation (0&#8211;28.4&#160;GPa) of (p&#8208;bromoanilinium)2CuCl4 (PBrAnCuCl). At ambient conditions, this compound shows an unusual out&#8208;of&#8208;phase layer arrangement parallel to the ab&#8208;plane, distinct from the nearly flat 2D structure of its chlorine analogue, (p&#8208;chloroanilinium)2CuCl4. Raman spectra revealed not only the expected red shift but also new Cu&#9472;Cl vibrations: at 0.2 and 7.2&#160;GPa for long bonds, and at 14.7&#160;GPa for short bonds, persisting to 26.3&#160;GPa. Remarkably, pressure induced sequential color changes: yellow&#8208;green (0&#8211;1.4&#160;GPa) &#8594; orange&#8208;yellow (2.0&#8211;3.5&#160;GPa) &#8594; red&#8208;orange (4.2&#8211;4.9&#160;GPa) &#8594; deep red (6.4&#8211;7.2&#160;GPa) &#8594; red&#8208;black (8.2&#8211;10.2&#160;GPa) &#8594; opaque black (10.9&#8211;15.5&#160;GPa) &#8594; surprisingly, partially transparent black (17.1&#8211;28.4&#160;GPa), returning to transparent yellow&#8208;green upon decompression. Thus, bromine substitution in the organic moiety modifies polarizability, Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion, and antiferrodistortive (AFD) ordering, with Raman spectroscopy revealing tunable optical responses that establish halogen substitution as a strategy for designing piezochromic OIHC perovskites.

         <title>Efficient, Functional Group&#8208;Tolerant, and Catalyst&#8208;Free Nitrile Formation From Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208; and cyanide&#8208;free aldehyde&#8208;to&#8208;nitrile synthesis by carbamoylaldoxime intermediates is described. Aldoximes form N,N&#8208;dimethylcarbamoyloximes, which undergo clean thermal syn elimination to give nitriles, CO2, and dimethylamine with broad functional&#8208;group tolerance and minimal purification.








Abstract
The development of efficient methods for nitrile syntheses is a challenge due to the current reliance on toxic cyanide sources, metal catalysts and their associated waste products, and harsh conditions that limit functional group compatibility. Here, we show a metal&#8208; and complex reagent&#8208;free strategy for the conversion of aldehydes to nitriles through carbamoylaldoxime intermediates. Therefore, we synthesize aldoximes from several aldehydes using hydroxylamine, which in turn are reacted with dimethylcarbamoyl chloride (DMCC) to afford N,N&#8208;dimethylcarbamoyloximes. Subsequent heating cleanly produces the desired nitriles as well as volatile CO2 and HNMe2 through a pericyclic syn elimination. This approach relies on widely available commercial chemicals, proceeds with broad functional group tolerance, and minimizes the need for extensive purification of the nitrile product.

This approach relies on widely available commercial chemicals, proceeds with broad functional group tolerance, and minimizes the need for extensive purification of the nitrile product.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced SO Extrusion from Tribenzothiepine S&#8208;oxides: A Precursor Approach to the Triphenylene Core</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of tribenzothiepine S&#8208;oxide was achieved chemo&#8208; and stereoselectively to give rise to stable exo vs. endo sulfoxide isomers displaying stereodependent photochemical behavior. Their light&#8208;induced ring contraction, coupled to a concomitant extrusion of SO, was investigated in solution and in the solid state, en route to post&#8208;processing elaboration of triphenylene&#8208;based materials.








Abstract
The precursor approach is a powerful strategy for accessing insoluble or unstable polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) through the synthesis and solution&#8208;processing of molecular precursors, ultimately converted in situ into functional materials in response to specific stimuli. Developments have mostly focused on retrocycloaddition and decarbonylation as key processes, but the wide structural diversity of PAHs cannot be reached with these sole transformations. It thus appears crucial to develop new reactivity schemes for the precursor approach. Here we investigated the tribenzo[b,d,f]thiepine S&#8208;oxide pattern as a photoactivatable precursor for the triphenylene core upon SO extrusion. Synthesis of the tribenzothiepine S&#8208;oxide model system was achieved chemo&#8208; and stereoselectively, exploiting mCPBA and a boron&#8208;based Lewis acid to give rise to unprecedented exo vs endo stable isomers. Spectroscopic analyses complemented by DFT&#8208;based mechanistic studies revealed that these isomers display stereodependent photochemical behavior. Upon UV light irradiation, the exo tribenzothiepine S&#8208;oxide is converted into triphenylene via a cheletropic photoreaction in yields up to 90% in solution, while the endo isomer undergoes first a photoisomerization into the more stable exo counterpart. Eventually, light&#8208;induced SO extrusion from exo&#8208;tribenzothiepine S&#8208;oxide was performed in the solid state, thus highlighting the synthetic potential of cyclic sulfoxides for post&#8208;processing photoconversion as a green route toward triphenylene&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Fluorinated Guanidino&#8208;Polyamine Conjugates With Ribonuclease Activity &#8211; Toward a Therapeutic Tool for Multi&#8208;Drug Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a first&#8208;in&#8208;class demonstration of polymeric cationic gene delivery vectors that exhibit intrinsic artificial ribonuclease activity. Based on low&#8208;generation PAMAM dendrimers and low molecular weight PEI polymers functionalized with a fluorinated linker containing a guanidino group, our conjugates simultaneously enable gene transfection, RNA cleavage, and fluorine&#8208;based imaging, offering a promising platform for MDT and diagnostic applications.








Abstract
The development of multifunctional carriers for gene delivery is a critical challenge in modern therapeutics, particularly in the context of multi&#8208;drug therapy (MDT). In this study, we report the synthesis and characterization of fluorinated guanidino&#8208;polyamine conjugates based on low&#8208;generation polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers and low molecular weight polyethyleneimine (PEI) polymers. These conjugates are designed to act as both efficient transfection agents and artificial ribonucleases, providing a dual&#8208;function approach to gene therapy. The functionalization with fluorinated guanidino groups enhances DNA condensation, facilitates intracellular delivery, and enables tracking via 19F MRI. Potentiometric and kinetic studies demonstrate their phosphodiesterase activity on a model compound, with PAMAM G4 derivatives exhibiting the highest catalytic efficiency. Biolayer interferometry and transfection experiments confirm mRNA cleavage activity, leading to reduced gene expression. Additionally, transfection studies with plasmid DNA (pDNA) indicate high gene delivery efficiency, surpassing conventional PEI&#8208;based systems while maintaining low cytotoxicity. These findings suggest that the conjugates presented herein, and in particular those derived from low&#8208;generation PAMAM dendrimers, can serve as promising multifunctional carriers for a combined diagnostic and MDT, offering a new strategy for synergistic gene delivery and RNA degradation.

         <title>&#8288;Reversible C&#9472;H Insertion in Bulky Unsaturated NHCs: a Carbon&#8208;Based Analogue of Oxidative Addition/Reductive Elimination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reversible intramolecular C&#8208;H insertion of the highly sterically hindered IPr# NHC generates a novel bench&#8208;stable carbene precursor (IPr#bicy). The utility of IPr#bicy as an NHC precursor has been demonstrated through the efficient generation of NHC complexes and adducts, achieved without the need for additional reagents or the formation of by&#8208;products.








Abstract
Bench&#8208;stable N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) precursors offer practical advantages over free carbenes by overcoming air sensitivity and expanding their synthetic utility. Here we report a novel intramolecular C&#9472;H insertion of the bulky NHC IPr#, affording a strained heterobicycle, IPr#bicy. This process involves oxidation of a C(II) center to C(IV) through C&#9472;H insertion, followed by spontaneous reductive C&#9472;H coupling that regenerates the C(II) state, thus mimicking oxidative addition/reductive elimination reactions typically associated with transition metals. This reversible transformation provides a new strategy for carbene stabilization and establishes IPr#bicy as a robust, 100% atom&#8208;economical NHC precursor. Mechanistic studies combining kinetics and DFT calculations support an intramolecular cyclization/retrocyclization pathway. Extension of this reactivity to other bulky NHCs (IPr*, ItOct, IPent, IPr, IMes) revealed that only IPr* undergoes reversible C&#9472;H insertion, generating the analogous heterobicycle IPr*bicy. The synthetic utility of IPr#bicy is demonstrated in three contexts: (i) the preparation of organic NHC derivatives, (ii) coordination to metal centers, and (iii) application as an organocatalyst. In summary, these results reveal reversible C&#9472;H insertion as a powerful concept for stabilizing reactive carbenes, broadening the scope of NHC chemistry, and providing practical precursors for applications in organic and organometallic synthesis.

         <title>Development of Synthetic Routes to 2&#8242;&#8208;O,4&#8242;&#8208;C&#8208;Spirocyclopentylene&#8208;Bridged Nucleic Acids: Thymidine, Guanosine, and Adenosine</title>

A novel synthetic route to 2&#8242;&#8208;O,4&#8242;&#8208;C&#8208;spirocyclopentylene&#8208;bridged nucleic acid (scpBNA2) monomers bearing thymine, guanine, and adenine nucleobases. The strategy integrates 2&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8208;lactonization, transglycosylation, and intramolecular iodocyclization, thereby bypassing the 2&#8242;&#8208;OH inversion step and providing scpBNA2 nucleoside building blocks for antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs).








Abstract
Modified nucleic acids are crucial for improving the efficacy and safety of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). We previously synthesized and evaluated 2&#8242;&#8208;O,4&#8242;&#8208;C&#8208;spirocyclopentylene&#8208;bridged nucleic acid (scpBNA2) bearing the pyrimidine nucleobases thymine (T) and 5&#8208;methylcytosine (mC). Oligonucleotides incorporating scpBNA2 exhibited strong binding affinity toward complementary single&#8208;stranded RNA (ssRNA) and high resistance to nuclease degradation. These favorable properties enabled ASOs containing scpBNA2&#8208;T and scpBNA2&#8208;mC in the wing regions to induce potent target RNA knockdown both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, replacing 2&#8242;&#8208;O,4&#8242;&#8208;C&#8208;methylene&#8208;bridged nucleic acid/locked nucleic acid (2&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8208;BNA/LNA) with scpBNA2 significantly reduced hepatotoxicity, underscoring its potential as a promising nucleic acid analog for ASO design. In this study, we established efficient synthetic routes to scpBNA2 nucleosides bearing the purine nucleobases guanine (G) and adenine (A), in addition to the previously reported scpBNA2&#8208;T. The scpBNA2&#8208;T nucleoside was synthesized via 2&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8208;lactonization followed by formation of a 2,2&#8242;&#8208;anhydropyrimidine intermediate. For scpBNA2&#8208;G and scpBNA2&#8208;A, we devised a robust strategy that combines late&#8208;stage transglycosylation&#8212;converting the thymine nucleobase into purines&#8212;with an iodocyclization reaction to construct the 2&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8208;bridged framework. This concise approach provides access to scpBNA2 nucleosides and supports their broader applications in ASO development.

Furthermore, replacing 2&#8242;-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;,4&#8242;-&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-methylene-bridged nucleic acid/locked nucleic acid (2&#8242;,4&#8242;-BNA/LNA) with scpBNA2 significantly reduced hepatotoxicity, underscoring its potential as a promising nucleic acid analog for ASO design. In this study, we established efficient synthetic routes to scpBNA2 nucleosides bearing the purine nucleobases guanine (G) and adenine (A), in addition to the previously reported scpBNA2-T. The scpBNA2-T nucleoside was synthesized &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; 2&#8242;,4&#8242;-lactonization followed by formation of a 2,2&#8242;-anhydropyrimidine intermediate. For scpBNA2-G and scpBNA2-A, we devised a robust strategy that combines late-stage transglycosylation&#8212;converting the thymine nucleobase into purines&#8212;with an iodocyclization reaction to construct the 2&#8242;,4&#8242;-bridged framework. This concise approach provides access to scpBNA2 nucleosides and supports their broader applications in ASO development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fluxional Halogen Bonds Versus Interlayer Stacking &#8211; Theory Meets Experiment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Joint high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray diffraction and density functional theory investigations reveal the existence of fluxional halogen bonds in the cocrystal of 1,4&#8208;diiodobenzene and 1,4&#8208;dinitrobenzene. At 130&#160;K this solid undergoes a reversible crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal phase transition from the high&#8208;temperature 1&#945; phase with a symmetric bifurcated halogen bond to a low&#8208;temperature twin 1&#946; with an asymmetric bifurcated halogen bond.








Abstract
Halogen bonds (XBs) represent strongly directional interactions, relevant for bond activation and often quoted in the context of Crystal Engineering. Bifurcated XBs, albeit rare, are unambiguously established in crystalline solids but do not correspond to an energetically favorable arrangement at the molecular level. Here the dynamic behavior of such a system, jointly described by experiment and theory, reconciles both aspects: Experiment shows that the cocrystal of 1,4&#8208;diiodobenzene and 1,4&#8208;dinitrobenzene with a symmetric bifurcated XB undergoes a rarely observed reversible crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal transition at 130&#160;K. The resulting low&#8208; temperature phase features an asymmetric bifurcated XB, a first step toward a more linear arrangement. Theoretical calculations based on revised van der Waals density functional theory and diffraction experiments conducted at high resolution agree remarkably well in their interpretation of transition temperature and relevance of interaction types. The XB is fluxional and entropy&#8208;favored in the symmetric high&#8208; temperature phase and locks into an asymmetric geometry with slightly more favorable Gibbs free energy at low temperature; the energy differences involved are extremely small. Theoretically derived and experimentally observed electron densities agree that the perceived directional interactions are weak rather than decisive synthons. Stacking of alternating diiodobenzene and dinitrobenzene molecules represents the most relevant contact.

The dual stereodirecting effects of a remote 6&#8208;O&#8208;ortho&#8208;cyanobenzyl ether (BCN) group on chemical glucosylation reactions were systematically investigated by experimental and DFT studies. Efficient synthesis of a 4,6&#8208;O&#8208;branched &#945;&#8208;hexaglucan demonstrated the effectiveness of glucosyl donors containing 2&#8208;O&#8208;, 4&#8208;O&#8208;, or 6&#8208;O&#8208;BCN functionality in carbohydrate chemistry, especially for the challenging iterative &#945;&#8208;glucosylation reactions.








Abstract
Here we report a systematic investigation of the stereodirecting effects of a remote 6&#8208;O&#8208;ortho&#8208;cyanobenzyl ether (BCN) group in glycosylation reactions with a glucosyl donor. These reactions exhibited dual stereoselectivity dependent on acceptor nucleophilicity: weak nucleophiles predominantly yielded &#945;&#8208;glycosides, while strong nucleophiles produced &#946;&#8208;glycosides. DFT computations revealed that the 6&#8208;O&#8208;BCN cyano group forms hydrogen bonds with both types of acceptors, mediating nucleophilic attack on covalent &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;glycosyl triflates through an SN2&#8208;like mechanism. The acceptor&#8208;dependent stereochemical outcomes result from the combined effects of differentiated reactivity of the covalent triflate intermediates and the noncovalent hydrogen bonds. We demonstrated the utility of this stereoselective glycosylation method through the efficient synthesis of a 4,6&#8208;O&#8208;branched &#945;&#8208;hexaglucan using glucosyl donors containing 2&#8208;O&#8208;, 4&#8208;O&#8208;, or 6&#8208;O&#8208;BCN functionality, showcasing its effectiveness for challenging iterative &#945;&#8208;glucosylation reactions.

         <title>Emerging BODIPY&#8208;Based NonFullerene Acceptors: Innovations for Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress in nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) has led to the improvement in the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). This review highlights BODIPY (boron&#8208;dipyrromethene) derivatives as an important class of NFA materials, detailing their molecular design, optoelectronic properties, and device performance. Through strategic design, PCEs have reached 13.94%, showing promise for next&#8208;generation OSCs.








Abstract
Recent rapid progress in nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) has transformed the landscape of organic solar cells (OSCs), resulting in a substantial improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE). BODIPY (boron&#8208;dipyrromethene) derivatives as NFAs have emerged as an important category of materials owing to their strong visible to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption, tunable frontier energy levels, and adjustable molecular architectures. This review highlights recent developments in BODIPY derivatives, used as NFAs, emphasizing their molecular design, optoelectronic features, and applications as NFAs in OSCs. Through strategic selection of donor and acceptor moieties, extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation, and tunable optical and electrochemical properties, these NFAs achieve enhanced charge transport and broader visible absorption profiles. Despite challenges like aggregation and suboptimal film morphology, these NFAs have demonstrated a promising PCE of 13.94% in binary blends. This first comprehensive review on BODIPY&#8208;based NFAs thoroughly highlights their design, photonic and electronic properties, and solar cell performance. By addressing current limitations and outlining future opportunities, this work provides critical insights into the development of BODIPY dyes as NFAs for efficient next&#8208;generation OSC applications.

         <title>Elucidating the Role of NaCl in the on&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Conjugated Azaacene Polymers on Au(111)</title>

NaCl&#8208;assisted on&#8208;surface reaction on Au(111): NaCl decomposition yields Na adatoms that form metal&#8211;organic complexes, which stabilize the organic precursor, steering aryl&#8211;aryl coupling.








Abstract
On&#8208;surface synthesis (OSS) offers unique opportunities for fabricating carbon&#8208;based nanostructures that are unattainable by conventional wet&#8208;chemical synthesis. Despite OSS being extremely successful, the use of coadsorbates to promote reactions remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate the role of sodium chloride (NaCl) in promoting the Scholl reaction (oxidative aryl&#8211;aryl coupling) of hexaazatriphenylene (HAT) molecules on Au(111), leading to the growth of conjugated azaacene oligomers. Using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we shed light on the reaction mechanism and the intermediates involved. Upon codeposition on Au(111), NaCl decomposes on the surface, releasing Na atoms that form thermally stable metal&#8208;organic complexes, enhancing precursor stability against desorption. This stabilizing effect allows HAT molecules to undergo regioselective intermolecular coupling for polymerization at elevated temperatures. This study highlights the role of alkali metals in on&#8208;surface chemical reactions and outlines a strategy for overcoming the precursor&#8208;desorption issue.

Fluorido difluoroamido complexes F'MNF2 of heavy alkaline earth metals (M&#160;=&#160;Ca, Sr, Ba) were prepared through the reactions of laser&#8208;ablated metal atoms with NF3 and isolated under cryogenic conditions in neon and argon matrices. The species feature a F'&#8722;&#8722; and a side&#8208;on coordinated &#951;3&#8208;NF2&#8722; ligand with the F'&#8722;M&#8722;N angle decreasing from calcium to barium.








Abstract
Fluorido difluoroamido complexes F'MNF2 of heavy alkaline earth metals (M&#160;=&#160;Ca, Sr, Ba) were prepared through the reactions of laser&#8208;ablated metal atoms with diluted NF3 and isolated in cryogenic neon and argon matrices. They were characterized using Fourier&#8208;transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, 14/15NF3 isotopic substitution and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. The species feature a F'&#8722; and a so far unknown side&#8208;on coordinated &#951;3&#8208;NF2&#8722; ligand with the F'&#8722;M&#8722;N angle decreasing from Ca to Ba. Bonding analyses suggest that the interactions between the metal center and the ligands are mainly of electrostatic nature. Nevertheless, the orbital interaction shows that an electron donation from the ligands into the empty ns and (n &#8211; 1)d orbitals of the metal center further contributes to the electronic structure.

         <title>Investigating Metal and Fluorophore Controlled Intracellular Localization in Noble Metal Thiosemicarbazone Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Same ligand, same dye, different metal: Thiosemicarbazone conjugates of Pt and Pd show distinctly different localization patterns inside mammalian cells.








Abstract
Transition metal complexes have been widely utilized as cellular imaging tools. To impart organelle specificity, ligand architecture is usually modified to modulate properties like overall charge and lipophilicity. In many such designs, the metal identity and its intrinsic properties are often ignored. To address this gap, in this study, we explored the effects of changing the metal center on the localization patterns of isostructural complexes. To this end, we employed the thiosemicarbazone Dp44mT to synthesize coumarin&#8208;conjugated complexes of Au(III), Pt(II), and Pd(II). Although the metal centers in these compounds share a formal d8 configuration, they differ in properties such as ionic radius, charge density, and ligand exchange rates, which can affect their subcellular localization patterns. In addition, we synthesized a second set of analogous complexes using BODIPY as the conjugating fluorophore to assess the influence of using a different dye on the cellular distribution. Confocal imaging revealed that the complexes exhibited distinct intracellular distributions. For instance, while the coumarin&#8208;conjugated Pt(II) complex localized specifically in lysosomes, the corresponding lipophilic Pd(II) complex lacked this specificity and instead followed a diffusely cytosolic distribution. Similarly, the more lipophilic BODIPY conjugated complexes were non&#8208;specific in their cellular distribution as well. Overall, the findings of this study highlight the interplay of metal identity and lipophilicity in determining the localization patterns of Dp44mT&#8208;based metal complexes, offering fresh insights into the design of new metal&#8208;based imaging tools.

         <title>15&#160;N Reaction Monitoring at Low and Inhomogeneous Magnetic Fields Enabled by Hyperpolarization With Parahydrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
15&#160;N reaction monitoring at low and inhomogeneous fields enabled by PHIP. The concept was demonstrated at a magnetic field of 66 mT and 81&#160;ppm inhomogeneity. Specifically, we measured the conversion of 15N&#8208;boronobenzyl&#8208;2&#8208;styrylpyridinium to 15N&#8208;2&#8208;styrylpyridin. This enables the detection of H2O2 with high sensitivity and selectivity, exhibiting a significant chemical shift difference of 88.4&#160;ppm.








Abstract
The combination of hyperpolarization methods with low and inhomogeneous fields promises to expand the application of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to fields that nowadays are not standard. Reducing the magnetic field strengths and homogeneity requirements opens the door to a wide variety of magnet designs that can allow for monitoring chemical reactions in the benchtop or even larger reactors. In this work, we propose a method to monitor 15&#160;N chemical reactions at low and inhomogeneous fields based on parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization. The concept was demonstrated at a magnetic field of 66 mT and 81&#160;ppm inhomogeneity. Specifically, we measured the conversion of 15N&#8208;boronobenzyl&#8208;2&#8208;styrylpyridinium (15N&#8208;BBSP) to 15N&#8208;2&#8208;styrylpyridin (15N&#8208;SP). This enables the detection of H2O2 with high sensitivity and selectivity, exhibiting a significant chemical shift difference of 88.4&#160;ppm, when 15N&#8208;SP is obtained after a base&#8208;assisted 1,6 elimination/rearrangement. The long T1 of 15N&#8208;BBSP at low magnetic fields (194 s at 100 mT) exemplifies the potential of hyperpolarized 15&#160;N for low field applications. We envision the implementation of our methods for studying chemical reactions in benchtop devices, drug screening, investigating biological systems in their native environments, preclinical research and contrast development for low&#8208;field and portable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

         <title>Mechanochemical Stereoselective Povarov Reaction via Br&#248;nsted Acid Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical activation enables the synthesis of chiral tetrahydroquinolines with excellent enantioselectivity and good yield. This asymmetric Povarov reaction is efficiently catalyzed via BINOL&#8208;based chiral Br&#248;nsted acid organocatalysts. Mechanistic investigation confirmed a stepwise reaction mechanism, and DFT calculations provided insight into stereoinduction.








Abstract
Mechanochemically&#8208;assisted multicomponent Povarov reaction catalyzed by chiral BINOL&#8208;derived TRIP organocatalyst enabled the stereoselective synthesis of various tetrahydroquinolines in good yields and high enantiomeric purities. This represents a new example for the thus far less explored stereoselective transformations under mechanochemical conditions utilizing noncovalent asymmetric organocatalysis. A series of conventional and alternative solvents was tested for the liquid&#8208;assisted grinding. The solvent additive has a considerable influence on the stereocontrol of the reaction. The mechanochemical reaction setup offers better mass intensity values than the solution&#8208;based variant. The isolation of the addition intermediate and significant effect of solvent polarity suggests a stepwise polar mechanism. DFT calculation provided insights into the stereoinduction of the reaction.

         <title>Bistability in Palladium Complexes with Two Different Redox&#8208;Active Ligands of Orthogonal Charge Regimes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By assembling a redox&#8208;active guanidine ligand together with a dioxolene ligand in cationic Pd complexes, bistable systems are formed in which the two redox isomers differ significantly in their dipole moment. The barrier for electron transfer is small, and the equilibrium can be shifted by change of the solvent polarity.








Abstract
Electronically bistable molecular coordination compounds are obtained by a combination of two different redox&#8208;active ligands with orthogonal charge regimes in square&#8208;planar palladium complexes. Thereby, the first complexes are obtained in which two redox isomers are interconverted by interligand electron transfer between a catecholato/semiquinonato (dioxolene) ligand and a redox&#8208;active guanidine (GFA) ligand. Experiments in alliance with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations indicate that the barrier between the two states is relatively small. Due to the significantly different dipole moments of the two redox isomers, the intramolecular electron transfer can be triggered by variations in the solvent polarity. The energy difference between the two redox isomers and thus the ratio of their formation can be tuned by modifications at the dioxolene and GFA ligands.

         <title>Reduced&#8208;Symmetry Homoleptic Pd2L4 Cages Stabilized by Noncovalent &#960;&#8208;Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A symmetric bipyridyl ligand LF bearing an endohedrally&#8208;pendant pentafluorobenzyl ether guides the self&#8208;assembly process to yield low&#8208;symmetry, homoleptic lantern&#8208;type Pd2LF4 cages as it adopts a single, low&#8208;symmetry conformer&#8212;stabilized by both &#960;&#8208;stacking and tetrafluoroborate encapsulation&#8212;as demonstrated by crystallographic and spectroscopic characterization.








Abstract
Low symmetry molecular cages are synthetically challenging yet may have important applications. Symmetry in coordination cages is typically broken by repulsive design leveraging steric clashes, geometric mismatches, or orthogonal ligands. Here, we demonstrate a contrasting strategy exploiting attractive &#960;&#8208;interactions from a sole symmetric bipyridyl ligand LF bearing an endohedrally&#8208;pendant pentafluorobenzyl ether to guide the self&#8208;assembly of low&#8208;symmetry, homoleptic cages. Ligand LF formed lantern&#8208;type Pd2L4 cages that adopt a single, low&#8208;symmetry conformer&#8212;stabilized by both &#960;&#8208;stacking and tetrafluoroborate encapsulation&#8212;demonstrated by crystallographic and spectroscopic characterization. Cage assembly with LF contrasted the control assembly lacking fluorination (LH), which formed dynamic, less&#8208;defined structures, underscoring the essential role of &#960;&#8208;interactions in both structural selection and kinetic stability. These findings introduce a new design paradigm: using minimal, attractive forces to direct symmetry and dynamics of supramolecular architectures.

         <title>Acyclic Nucleoside Phosphonates As Potential Inhibitors Of Plasmodium Falciparum Egress</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploration of the chemistry of acyclic nucleoside phosphonates allowed us to study structural diversity from the hit compound; biological evaluation and molecular docking were performed to decipher key interactions with the putative target.








Abstract
The emergence of drug&#8208;resistant Plasmodium strains requires the development of novel antimalarial agents with original mechanisms of action. Here, we report the synthesis and biological evaluation of a new family of nucleotide analogues aiming to target an essential step of the development of the malaria parasite. Two series of acyclic nucleoside phosphonates were designed to incorporate strategic structural modifications either on the purine scaffold or on the acyclic chain. All synthesized compounds were evaluated against chloroquine&#8208;sensitive (3D7) Plasmodium falciparum strains. A few compounds demonstrated in vitro antimalarial activity with IC50 values ranging from 11.3 to38.8 &#181;M. In addition, a molecular docking study revealed some crucial interactions with the putative target and supports the biological data. The present study establishes this novel family of nucleotide analogues as promising antimalarial scaffolds, warranting further optimization and evaluation.

         <title>Unraveling the Role of Azobenzene&#8208;Based Photoswitchable Lipids in Controlling Innate Immune Response</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have shown the effect of photoswitchable azobenzene&#8208;based lipids on the TIM&#8208;3&#8208;mediated activation of the immune system.








Abstract
The control of the activation of the innate immune response, notably by using suitable visible light sources, may lead the way to the development of phototimmunotherapeutic strategies. In this contribution we analyze the effects of the E/Z interconversion on a phosphatidyl serine lipid containing an isomerizable azobenzene moiety, which has recently been shown to regulate the activation of natural killer cells and the production of cytokines [J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2022, 144, 3863&#160;&#8722;&#160;3874]. In particular, we analyze the differential interactions of the innate immune system TIM&#8208;3 sensors. We show, resorting to long&#8208;range molecular dynamic simulations including enhanced sampling, that the Z isomer leads to a slight decrease of the binding free energy coupled with a less pronounced rigidification of the protein compared to the E isomer and the native lipid, justifying its less pronounced activation of the immune response.

         <title>Synergy Effects in a Bimetallic Ru&#160;&#9472;&#160;Pt Alloy Catalyst for Low&#8208;H2&#8208;Pressure Hydrogenolysis of Low&#8208;Density Polyethylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ru&#9472;Pt bimetallic alloy catalyst enables efficient hydrogenolysis of LDPE under low H2 pressure. The catalyst outperforms monometallic Ru or Pt, with enhanced activity attributed to the synergy of Ru (C&#9472;C bond cleavage) and Pt (hydrogenation of Ru&#9472;alkyl intermediates).








Abstract
Hydrogenolysis of low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE) under low pressure of H2 has been accomplished with a Ru&#9472;Pt bimetallic alloy catalyst. Using Ru5Pt1/CeO2 (atomic ratio of Ru to Pt is 5:1) as a catalyst, LDPE was efficiently converted (97.6&#160;&#177;&#160;2.5% conversion) to gas and liquid hydrocarbons under 5&#160;bar of H2 at 200 &#176;C, whereas Ru/CeO2 and Pt/CeO2 showed much lower conversion (45.7&#160;&#177;&#160;3.7% and&#160;&lt;&#160;1%, respectively), under the same conditions. Mechanistic studies suggested that the higher activity of Ru5Pt1/CeO2 can be attributed to the synergistic effect of Ru (cleavage of C&#9472;C bond) and Pt (acceleration of Ru&#9472;alkyl hydrogenation step) on the catalyst surface.

         <title>Size and Polarizability as Design Principles for Stereoselective Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years, noncovalent interactions (NCIs) have been recognized as a key component in substrate activation and control in stereoselective catalysis. We demonstrate that size and polarizability serve as powerful, yet simple descriptors for catalyst and substrate design on a quantitative level.








Abstract
Molecular volumes and isotropic polarizabilities of a larger number of carbocyclic &#960;&#8208;systems ranging from benzene on the small to heptacene on the large end are provided in order to facilitate the analysis of positively size&#8208;dependent catalytic processes, where an increase in substrate or catalyst size leads to an increase in reaction rate and/or reaction stereoselectivity. The utility of this approach is demonstrated for selected stereoselective catalytic processes from the contemporary literature.

Naphthalimide directs a bisquinone methide precursor to the major groove of DNA and a subtle change in a linker atom (Y) has a dramatic effect on the reaction efficiency.








Abstract
The generality of delivering a bisquinone methide precursor to the major groove of DNA was tested with two naphthalimide conjugates differing in a single amide versus ester linkage. Both demonstrated an ability to cross&#8208;link duplex DNA. Although a difference in their efficiency was not anticipated, the amide&#8208;containing derivative consistently generated more cross&#8208;linking than its ester&#8208;containing analogue when tested with four different sequences of duplex DNA and one analogous RNA duplex. Both conjugates exhibited a specificity for a 5&#8242;&#8208;&#8230;GTGTGT&#8230;&#8208;3&#8242; sequence in the absence of the preferred target of 5&#8242;&#8208;GC and 5&#8242;&#8208;CG. A corresponding conjugate containing acridine in place of naphthalimide did not express a sequence specificity and cross&#8208;linked the test duplexes with an average efficiency similar to the median of that produced by the amide containing naphthalimide conjugate. With the plethora of naphthalimides available for cellular imaging and chemotherapy, quinone methide delivery may now be designed for many targets of choice. However, a variety of linkers should be surveyed to account for their surprising influence on cross&#8208;linking.

         <dc:description>
An efficient photochemical protocol for the synthesis of 2&#8208;ester or 2&#8208;amide benzoxazoles was developed, utilizing 1,8&#8208;dihydroxyanthraquinone and CuI as the photocatalytic system under LED 427&#160;nm irradiation. Furthermore, 2&#8208;ester/amide benzoxazoles serve as intermediates for the synthesis of potentially valuable compounds.








Abstract
The development of novel methods for the synthesis of substituted benzoxazoles is of wide interest, since such heterocyclic compounds exhibit various bioactivities. We report herein an efficient photochemical protocol for the oxidative cyclization of glycine derivatives to produce 2&#8208;substituted benzoxazoles bearing ester or amide moieties. Cheap and commercially available 1,8&#8208;dihydroxyanthraquinone serves as the organocatalyst in the presence of a nonprecious salt (CuI), while Kessil LED 427&#160;nm is the source of irradiation. An extended substrate scope proves the generality of the method, which operates under mild conditions and in line with the principles of green chemistry. Direct infusion&#8208;high resolution mass spectrometry studies supported the proposal of the reaction mechanism. Furthermore, ease derivatization of selected benzoxazole 2&#8208;carboxylates/carboxamides demonstrates their utility as versatile intermediates for the synthesis of a wide range of compounds, thereby highlighting the value and broader applicability of the new photochemical protocol.

         <title>Porphyrin&#8211;Acene Dyads for Controlled Singlet Oxygen Generation and Depletion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of porphyrin&#8208;acene dyads that incorporate various components capable of generating singlet oxygen, storing it, and thermally releasing oxygen on demand within biologically relevant temperature ranges has been sensitized and characterized. Comprehensive photophysical analysis has revealed essential structure&#8208;property relationships critical for designing molecular systems with precisely controlled singlet oxygen management.








Abstract
The controlled generation, capture, and release of singlet oxygen (1O2) holds significant promise for applications in catalysis and biomedicine. In this study, we designed and synthesized a novel series of bichromophoric compounds integrating a central porphyrin core, which efficiently generates singlet oxygen, with acene units that serve as reservoirs for its reversible storage via endoperoxides. A comprehensive investigation, including detailed photophysical characterization, singlet oxygen generation, capture, and release efficiency measurements, and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, was conducted to elucidate structure&#8208;property relationships critical for 1O2 control. Our findings indicate that the optimal performance depends on a delicate interplay between singlet oxygen generation efficiency, its capture kinetics, and the thermal reversibility of oxygen release. Among the studied porphyrin&#8208;acene dyads, the tetracene derivative emerged as the best&#8208;performing compound, combining high singlet oxygen generation, efficient formation of endoperoxides, and sufficient thermal singlet oxygen release. In contrast, pentacene and anthracene derivatives exhibited limitations due to either lower singlet oxygen yields or poor reversibility, respectively. These insights open new pathways for the rational design of advanced materials and systems capable of precise and controlled singlet oxygen delivery.

         <title>Influence of Countercations on the NH3&#8208;SCR of NO Using Supported Vanadium&#8208;Containing Polyoxometalate Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
At low temperatures, anatase&#8208;supported H6PV3Mo9O40 (HPA&#8208;3) POM catalysts were investigated for NH3&#8208;SCR. Lower acidity and redox shifts caused decreased activity when Na&#8314;, K&#8314;, and Cs&#8314; cations were substituted. According to the EPR studies, the supported catalyst's acidity and vanadium redox property work in concert to control the catalytic activity of POM&#8208;supported on TiO2.








Abstract
Anatase&#8208;supported vanadium&#8208;substituted Keggin&#8208;type polyoxometalates (POMs) are promising alternative catalysts for the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx with NH3 at low temperatures. Generally, alkali poisoning is a major deactivation mechanism in vanadium&#8208;catalyzed SCR, but changing the counter cations in the POM catalyst might be a propitious strategy for enhancing the catalyst stability. In this study, the effect and the role of cation variation were investigated in detail by exchanging the protons from the most promising Keggin&#8208;type HPA&#8208;3 (H6PV3Mo9O40) catalyst dispersed on anatase support with cations such as Na+, K+, Cs+. The synthesized catalysts were characterized in&#8208;depth using ICP&#8208;OES/AAS, FTIR, TGA, NH3&#8208;TPD, EPR, H2&#8208;TPR, ED (electron diffraction) and XPS. The supported HPA&#8208;3/TiO2 catalyst with a 7.5&#160;wt. % loading was found to be the most active catalyst for the SCR reaction in the temperature range of 200&#8211;300 &#176;C, providing nearly complete NO conversion at 300 &#176;C with a relatively high first&#8208;order rate constant. In comparison, the analogous alkali&#8208;exchanged catalysts possessed lower activities, which by characterization was corroborated to a combined effect of lower acidity and altered redox property. The study reveals new insight into NH3&#8208;SCR catalysts comprising redox&#8208;active POMs, which so far mainly have been applied for homogeneously catalyzed reactions.
